B007VDN1PA|5.0|I have a lot of slides from my childhood that I have wanted to get on my computer and didn't want to pay someone all they ask for the service.  Now, I'm enjoying doing them and it's easy.  Thanks
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Kinky Boots and an amazing cast make this a very entertaining day/night in the theater.  Billy Porter's fantastic<br />performance makes the rest of the cast shine even more.  Fun listening and seeing.  Run don't walk and enjoy.<br />  Don DeMaio
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|If your stuck at home and are bored its an ok movie, don't expect anything with a complex plot or character development.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|it is a real cool game at first I thought I would not like it but I do like it.<br />has anyone gotten to level 37 that is where I'm at and I can not get past
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Its not bad, but it wasn't great either. This movie had a lot of potential but it really didn't live up to what I was expecting. When I was done watching it I thought to my self, &#34;ok, not really what I wanted&#34; but it wasn't bad.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I have made it to level 37 of this very fun little game.So far it ifs quite entertaining, and even frustrating in a fun way. If anyone has tips for level 37, I sure would appreciate them.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. The plot was interesting and the acting was good. To be honest this is the kind of movie I enjoy the most so maybe my opinion is a bit bias, but at least I admit it is my opinion and not fact....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was slightly worried at 1st that this would be too sad or depressing of a book, but it was not in any way. It was a touching, & moving read. The characters were so great, that you forget they're not real people. I would absolutely recommend it to any one of my friends.
B00CZF87TY|5.0|Pharrell and CeeLo both did an amazing ! From the time that i heard it in the theatre I was in LOVE 😍. Clap along if you feel HAPPY..... Boop Boop Boop.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|I can drop my Kindle in this case into my bag and know it will by protected and not get scratched or broken.  It is very handy to have.
074401493X|5.0|this is a must have for all The Last Of Us fans!!! the key chain is made with surprising detail. the book covers every aspect of the game that you will need and the hardcover edition looks great! Really worth the money!
B005HED11Y|5.0|So happy for this. Star trek is one of those shows that takes you back to your childhood. A person cannot go wrong with this.lO
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This fast-paced drama shows the complex relationships between the English aristocracy and the servant class in the early 20th Century.  Wonderful characters; wonderful storylines!
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Not just another Zombie story but a great read where different situations from all over the word are reported and recorded to the point where you think it could be real.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book works best if you are formatting your book in Microsoft Word under the HTML system.  Very easy to follow.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I don't have words for how much I enjoyed this book. The depth of the story is amazing , even more amazing than the plot itself (which was great. The overall story was interesting and kept my attention) it really was more than just a pleasant story though. The book made me think. It had me jotting down notes this way and that. If you enjoy books that expand your mind and make you think this is for you. Even if you choose to ignore the depth the story is still fantastic
140006922X|5.0|Like many of the trolls posting negative comments, I haven't read this book. And before I saw that Fox interview and saw the despicable behavior of so-called Christians trashing a book that they haven't even read, I had no interest in it. But because of these things, I'm buying a copy. I'm pretty sure Mr. Aslan would like to thank all you haters for pushing his sales through the roof, nice work.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I try to update the game but what do I get? No update button on the page. Usually when there is an update available an update button shows up. But there is no update button and there is an update available. But everything else is fine!
B005MLP8E0|5.0|I enjoyed watching this for the third time, sure to watch more. Time well spent. Orson Welles at his finest.
B00594XOZU|4.0|It's super fast and a great way to talk with friends! I love.it! I use it more than texting now. Just some bad things like when ever you shut your kindle off, you don't receive the messages. You need to go in the app and then you get all the messages. Most people that I message, have iPods. Theirs is updated. They can do more things. And they send me videos, memes, etc.. And when I try to open it, it takes me to Google play to update it. Please fix! But over all great app!(:
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love this story and the man who stars in it.  He is eye candy of the finest.  The dialogue is hard to understand at times but who cares when you can look at him.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It's a great game but a can't buy stuff such as decorations because when I tap store it exits the game and it freezes but other than that great game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|cool app needs more levels and needs to be harder overall good game another thing there are so many games like it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would prescribe this book to anyone who likes action,drama,and romance.<br /><br />and I would prescribe this book to anyone who likes death.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I would compare this to a Match game challenge....It is a good game, and different every time you play it, and not an easy game to win!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well!  You can never trust the government of Penam!  This book is surely a shocker and yet, where else could the story have taken us but here?  Every bit as chilling and exciting as the first book and can't wait for the last book!  What more does the government have in store for our characters and their families?  Who is working with whom?  Oh my!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|My daughter recommended this book which is far beyond my usual selections of mystery, intrigue, romance.  Absolutely unable to put it down....and anxious to discover the next book!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book in the Hunger Games trilogy was a bittersweet book.  In it, I have had to say goodbye to favorite characters, cheer for other characters and overall adjust to the surprising ending that wasn't totally satisfactory and yet probably had to happen because of all that has come before.  I will miss these characters and storyline...goodbye old friends.
034580404X|5.0|these are quite the books! i can't wait to see the movie! even my husband said he would see it and he didn't read the trilogy.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Stable nice set of options and the ads are not too intrusive<br />Works well on Kindle Fire.  Fun to play
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I ordered \\"Zealot\\" after seeing the author on \\"The Daily Show,\\" hardly a bastion of right-wing nutitude, it's true, but more balanced than Fox News for all that. (And, John Oliver at least lets his guests finish their sentences, unlike Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert. Colbert is getting worse as the years pass, but that's a different topic.)<br />I was intrigued by Reza Aslan's premise. The idea of Jesus' historical life is hardly new; after all, archaeologists and religion scholars have been looking for some clue to what his life was like for hundreds of years. Where was he from adolescence to his fateful, final year of life? How was it possible for such a seminal figure to have disappeared so completely from the historical record?<br />I'm a believer.<br />I wanted that to stand alone for anyone who might question my faith, but the idea of Jesus as a man ... well, isn't that what it's all about?<br />Aslan actually created an account that explains much, weaving in many things I'd heard of the years - the church founders kinda, sorta made Jesus' story fit into their idea of who he should be, but the WHY is explained. Women get the heave-ho in the Bible, but - Oh! That's why!<br />Possibly the myths about Jesus' life make me so interested in finding proof that he existed. He was real, not s plaster saint (the original plaster saint?) from the Bible. I was thrilled to hear Aslan's explanation of Jesus' possible motives, of the life and times in which he lived.<br />It makes sense and it in no way diminishes what I believe any more than the hundreds of alternative theories of how the Shroud of Turin was created diminishes my faith that's it's the burial shroud of Jesus.<br />And, re: Fox News' claim that Aslan is trying to hide his religion is so much, again, right-wing nutitude. Aslan says in the intro to his book, possibly on Page One, how he came to write \\"Zealot\\" as a disinterested Muslim who was looking for something to believe in, then his return to his own roots.<br />This is a lovely book. It's not for everyone, obviously, but I suggest reading it for illumination into the era in which Jesus was born and how he came - YES - to save the world.<br />Cathy Lubenski, author of \\"Trashy Chic\\"
1490313370|5.0|Emphasis on execution, which is necessary for success.<br /><br />I have this problem myself, since I like to read and sometimes fail to execute.<br /><br />I am currently unemployed, and see the need to execute James Altucher's advice...
B005HED11Y|4.0|Great fun looking back.<br />When they loaded up that first episode, do you think they had any idea where this show would lead?<br />Like I say, great trip down memory lane.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|4 of us played this for the first time last night, and we enjoyed it. Didn't take long to play, about 30 minutes(?), even though it was getting late. We did have to implement a &#34;no saying what you or other players have&#34; table talk rule because it was too easy for players to gang up on other players otherwise, but that didn't stop the friendly trash talk.<br /><br />Cards are good quality, and the little wooden counters are fine, and the embroidered &#34;velvet&#34; bag to hold it all in is both convenient and appropriate. I'm going to pickup some heart shaped counters to replace the wooden cubes.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I bought this to use in a custom computer I was building with my son... he didn't set it in right the first time and ended up bending some of the pins.  I was not very hopeful after straightening the pins using a credit card but the computer still turned on and didn't seem to have any issues so I'm very impressed with its quality! Whew...
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Wonderful action packed movie and I can't wait to see the sequel for this one.  I love all the actors, they did a great job.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|This game is my all time favorite. I look forward to playing it...I am addicted. Get this game...you will not be sorry...
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Great movie with a bunch of good actors along with major action taking place. I enjoyed all the actors, would like to have seen more of jet lei
B00B7ERH04|1.0|I finally thaught i had a good video vamera app until after a few uses it told me i didnt have enough camcoins, which you have to buy, dont let the word free decieve you!!
B002L3ARRU|5.0|There are so many great lines from this movie.  Our family finds ourselves saying &#34;Bueller, Bueller&#34; when someone isn't paying attention.
B00BVMXBVG|1.0|The first disc when loads says its Star Trek Next Generation and the second disc title also has nothing to do with Orphan Black.  On the first disc, the top menu doesn't display properly and you have to surf around blind to find how to get the episodes playing.<br /><br />Seems like the manufacturing was rushed.  Too bad because everything else about this show has been superb.
B0090SI4LU|2.0|The first bit of disappointment was watching the movie after reading the book. There was so much that was hyper-compressed, or changed, or missing altogether. [[ASIN:B003NAAZK4 The Host]] was a really good read, and that's coming from a forty-something guy who has zero interest in sparkly vampires. I really enjoyed the book a great deal. The movie just did not do its source material justice.<br /><br />So what if I hadn't read the book ? Would the movie version of The Host at least be a good action movie or just a good movie in general ? Sadly, no. The relationships were rather two dimensional and there simply wasn't enough of a thrill to consider this a full-blown popcorn muncher. I didn't care about these people. I wasn't on the edge of my seat during the various chase scenes. The movie wasn't horrible, but it could have been so much more. If you do anything, read the book. And then resist the temptation to see the big screen adaptation.
B00D2DI342|5.0|Remix done in the classic salsoul style of an era longone, a nice compliment the fantastic original that's been the jam of the summer of 2013 and beyond.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|it works fine it just didnt fix my kindle fire like the amazon people said it would.<br /><br />i ordered it because the amazon customer service said it would fix my kindle but it didnt although the charger works really well
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For $35 there is no reason to not buy one of these.  The amazing thing is that it is already worth the cost, and will only get better as more and more apps support Chromecast.  Set up is impossibly easy, and it runs nearly seamlessly after the initial buffer.  For $100 I would think this thing is cool and probably never buy it. For $35 I don't see how you can pass on it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game and I highly recommend this. So far it has a great story line and wonderful game play. This one will keep you busy.....and guessing!
B0016OOS16|3.0|I have a regular Navigator at work and it works great with Autodesk Inventor.  I was hoping that this would work on my laptop at home, but it doesn't. I have emailed both Autodesk and 3DConnexion and no solution thus far.
0385344333|5.0|This was the first Jack Reacher novel I read, and wow, it was really exciting. I got interested by the synopsis on the back<br />cover and I found that the story was as fun and 'mysterious' as I'd hoped. Will be reading more of these, that's for sure!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|a lot of fun, but it stalls out from time to time. gets very hard.  enjoy it. the player to player is a little lame
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey has been one of the best series I have ever watched.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  It has drama, comedy and romance all neatly packaged in a great story with an even better cast.
B00A27NN50|2.0|Unless you are a Jewish New Yorker, you're probably not going to like this movie.  I like Woody Allen, and have always heard references to Annie Hall, but my wife and I did not think very much of the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was such a good book. I highly recommend this book to everybody. It was hard to put the book down.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|I enjoyed it, even though it seemed mindless. Helped me relax.<br />Recommended for children and easy go-ers. Not novelists especially.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game can amuse you for hours. The sound effects crack me up. As much fun as a person can have with their pants on.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I love it. I watched some of the previous Hannibal movies and when I saw there was a TV series I was so excited. Brilliant show and I love the cast.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pretty easy setup and it works with my older Samsung mp3 player. Hopefully a majority of apps will soon be able to cast, guess we'll have to wait and see. Packaging is top rate even comes with a short 4\\" HDMI male to female extension. Pretty slick device especially at the price it'll be even slicker if Google throws major support behind it<br /><br />PS After over a week with my Chromecast I can tell you Roku has nothing to worry about I mean Cast works but is definitely a work in progress. I'm keeping it for travel and You Tube since Roku can't get UT on their box. Chrome's interface with NF is a joke tap tap tap tap and nothing until finally it wakes up same annoying NF delays using Nexus or Samsung devices. You Tube interface is better.
140006922X|1.0|The media is in love with Reza Aslan's new book Zealot, which claims to be a `historical' look at the life of Jesus. But there are a few problems with the book. The Muslim author has attempted to debunk the very things that made Jesus the center of Christianity. While Aslan is free to write whatever he wants, isn't it interesting that the one Jesus book the media decides to promote is the one that attempts to disprove him.  Another attempt at propaganda from the Muslim Brotherhood.  Total garbage.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|This movie created all the passion for prison shows we have today. No prison movie or show in the world compares to the depth of Shawshank Redemption.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Every day is a Blessing. Beautiful and inspiring story about love, life, prayer, and all things wonderful. Live life to the fullest!
1451695195|5.0|This book is a real page turner.  I just loved how different this author's NDE was.  It really makes you think about God and what we are all doing here!
B003R0MEZ4|3.0|I received my order sooner than expected, but the package was slightly damaged. The dvds and actual cases inside were perfectly fine, but the outside case was a bit bent/out of shape.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|I thought it was a very captivating movie. Despite his situation he held true to his morals and thats what would/did make him a good lawyer.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Although written more like a short story - it was a wonderful read. Great imagery and my book club loved it!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Got this faotd and love it! Sad though because I also completed it today. Wish there were more levels. Of course if there were I'd need ibuprofen for the headache! Least few levels were hard and made my brain hurt! Lol
B0014DW3OS|5.0|Denzel is amazing. I love Denzel as the bad guy. This movie is an action-packed ride from beginning to end.
B000WMFZMY|3.0|Enjoyed the movie, again!  Bought it after a few friends went on Pilgrimage in Spain an wanted to know something about the war between the Moors and Spain.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Typical Baldacci. I love his plot and character development. I always read as many of his books as I can.
B007HJ9NBE|3.0|I thought it was going to be a different type of movie but, I enjoyed it. If you like dancing/singing in movies you might like it.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|We really enjoyed the movie, lots of action!  We watched it twice I would definitely recommend.  Love Robert Downey, Jr, such a comedian.
B004ADF7RO|2.0|It's a good movie if you like those 80's old movies. The kids are kind of annoying and I had trouble understanding the script.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a seriously funny, everyone must read, more than five stars romance.  I had this on my TBR and am kicking myself that I didn't get to it faster.  Not only is this funny, I mean laugh so hard you spit whatever you're drinking out and wipe tears from your eyes funny, but it is the most unique perspective I have read.  First, it's completely in the male's POV.  Not often you see that.  But it's more than that.  Drew, the sexy star of this book, is talking to you, the reader.  Imagine you walk into a club and you belly up to the bar next to a guy, who is gorgeous mind you, but completely a mess.  Wrinkled shirt, hair is a mess, scruffy face . . . and he's had just enough to drink to spill his guts.  He tells you why he's such a mess and he doesn't leave out one little detail.  At first you feel sorry for him.  Then you think, my God what a pig. No wonder she left.  But he's so funny, you have to keep listening. He gives you advice on what men think and want as well. You get to knew Drew inside and out, and you have a great time in the process.  He's not actually sitting in a bar while telling his story, but this is how it kind of feels.<br /><br />The story itself is wonderful.  \\". . . sometimes a guy can't become a man until he's met the right woman.\\"  This story is about how Drew met that woman, Kate, lost her and fought like no other to get her back.  Even though this book is hilarious, it does end with really good advice.  \\"Assume nothing.\\"<br /><br />I'm definitely a forever fan of this author and can't to read more by her.
B00C2IF9SQ|5.0|Book was a very accurate portrayal of what it is like to take part in elite sport as well as an amazing story about an amazing person who as been through so much! Having read it, I feel like I know the author. Would have liked to have been able to download a kindle edition but was unable to do so as I am based in the UK.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Best books I have read in 10 years, without question. Fantastic description of characters, wonderful writing ... Just amazing fantasy fiction!!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This is the kind of book that should be read in spurts. It's overall concept is interesting (an oral history of the zombie apocalypse), and the author does a great job of leaving the details of important events to the imagination. In this way, it doesn't get bogged down in minutiae, opting instead to allow the reader to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />It doesn't read like a true novel, as each individual's account is unique, adding insight from a particular perspective about particular events. As a series of &#34;historically&#34; connected vignettes, this book is best read a little at a time. This approach saves the reader from becoming bored with the sometimes generic prose and allows the stories to linger in one's mind.<br /><br />It's definitely a cool little book, and for zombie fans it is no doubt a must read. Just be prepared for some unevenness and silliness to crop up in the weaker stories.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I downloaded this as the free app of the day and I'm so glad! This game is very entertaining.<br /><br />You have a factory ball as a model. Placing various objects like goggles and hats on your plain white ball and repainting it so that it matches the factory<br />ball.<br /><br />I like that there's no timer and to reset the ball is very easy. It's fun to see the number of boxes the factory balls are in decrease as you play the game.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|Overall, I rate the entire SG-1 series at 4 stars or higher for multiple reasons, the chief of which is that it is just good clean entertainment. The characters are largely likeable and the villains are easy to root against, and you wouldn't have to cover your  6 year-olds eyes and ears because of something unseemly.
1250012570|2.0|This book is listed under the Teen and Young Adult genre.  Just a heads up: It is full of profanities and f-bombs.  If it were a movie and contained the same dialogue it would be rated `R'.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I am a Twilight fan and have all of the cd's.  This one is a great addition to m set.
0786838655|5.0|Obviously, you are considering starting the Percy Jackson series, or you wouldn't be on Amazon reading other people's opinions on the thing.  Stop. Right Now. Buy this book. (as well as the rest of the series). While not as good as `harry Potter' (but what is really?), this series is still great in its own right.  Easy to read, fastpaced, exciting, funny, and filled with cliff-hangers.  I chewed through these books like they were candy, and you'll do the same.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|The DVD was new and I had no problems playing it in my DVD player.  I have played it may times and it still plays without a hitch.
1423101502|5.0|What more can be said about this series that hasn't already been said?  The best YA series since harry Potter ends on an absolute pitch perfect note, tying up man (but not all!) loose ends.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|i love it<br />the Kingston G2 USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader FCR-MRG2 (Black) it was very very nice
1423101499|5.0|After reading the entire series, I have to say this is the best of all the books (and that is a high compliment considering all are very good).  Puts the pedal to the medal from page one, and doesn't let up until the end.  Contains one doozy of a cliff hanger.  Just be glad the final book is already out and you don't have to wait 18 months to see how it all ends. :)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Grest movie, good plot and story line.  The good giys we have known and loved come to life with cool special effects and stay true to form.  Loved being able to stream and can't beatbthe price!
145210655X|5.0|Even if you don’t have children, you should buy this book.  Not really, a standard ‘book’ with a story, it more of collection of short cartoons that range from funny and cute to laugh-out-loud hysterical. My daughter and I both enjoy this book and read it often at bed-time.
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|We started watching it but it was clear after a few minutes that it was awful.  A waste of time and money.
1423136802|5.0|Obviously, you are considering starting the Percy Jackson series, or you wouldn't be on Amazon reading other people's opinions on the thing.  Stop. Right Now. Buy this set.

B005URRCUY|4.0|Arrived in good shape, and on time.<br />If you have not heard this group, check into them, and prepare to be amazed.
B002PZ8YCO|4.0|but wanted more. It was pleasant, enjoyable. Not a lot of meat.<br /><br />Sometimes, though, that's just what's on order. Right.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|I have come to like queensryche because their albums are all different, at least the ones I've heard.  This is a cool album that maintains  the kind of tragic temperament of Operation Mindcrime while integrating an edge of more modern rock.  Can't say I was on the edge of my seat the entire album, I'm just really impressed that Queensryche is still putting out sound with an edge.
6305882592|5.0|This is one of the great dark comedies of all time.  But be warned; it is dark.  Briefly:  A troubled young man who entertains himself by faking his own suicide meets an elderly woman who teaches him to find joy in life.

1490313370|3.0|The idea of choosing yourself instead of big corporations is not new. Very general in terms of writing style. Not many useful tips of<br />&#34;how to free yourself from the corporate America&#34;.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I love Neil Gaiman and have enjoyed all of his books but I'm afraid that after reading The Graveyard Book, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is unfortunately disappointing.  I never really clicked with the boy featured as the main character of the story and found the &#34;villain&#34; to be quite a bit less than frightening.  It's not a bad story but it failed to touch me the way The Graveyard Book did.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just when you think this book couldn't come up with anything else there is another turn..... Living the books!! Not just another romance novel.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This  is a great app for to you buy i buy it buy it.  You will love it. So get iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
B001FB4VXU|4.0|OK, so new episodes air every Thursday but you can't turn on TBS any night of the week and not find Big Bang Theory.  What does that tell you!  A show destined to become a classic
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The book needs to move on....or maybe additional plot.  Why did he have to kill the guy?  He was suppose to be smart and calculating so I don't get why.
B001TH16DI|4.0|These movies range from great to good.  I bought them when I started to get into the new movies.  Khan is a classic and Voyage Home stands all tests of time.  This is a great collection o BluRay
0307474259|4.0|Taubes explains the science behind metabolism, fat/energy usage and nutrition simply and in a way that drives his point well. I've read other books and tried different diets before, and from experience I know that the only thing that caused me to lose weight was to reduce my carbohydrate intake. Now I understand why that is so, and I also understand why it is hard to give up sugar and flour--- the explanation on insulin's mechanism shows why it's addictive.<br /><br />New and eye-opening to me was the history and politics of nutrition science. I gave only 4 stars because I would have liked a bit more detail on why a high-protein diet is not so bad. I've always heard that it's too much for the liver to process all that meat.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have 4 kids and very little time, but I had such a craving for a good book. I didn't want to risk wasting my time on a mediocre book so I turned to my Facebook Friends and family. I received many recommendations, but the one from my niece stood out. The idea of the story grabbed me and after I bought it (super cheap) I couldn't stop reading. Can't wait to read SHIFT and check out some of your other writings. Well done, I will recommend this to anyone. My husband is going to read it next! BTW thanks for the laugh at the end of the book (question section) ha
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think it is a great game and I love playing it.You never really get bored of playing it . IT is a much better game than a lot of the free games you get on tablets and androids now as well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After a few episodes I was hooked...the Maggie Smith is worth the price of admission...she was born for this role.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I would always play this game on the Computer it was always fun to beat it. 1 2 3 and 4 were so fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Levels are good and start out easy and progress nicely, i am waiting for new ones to come out so i can exercise my hunting skills farther
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is an amazing read. I will suggest it to anyone who asks me what to read in the future. its beautiful.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked it a lot better than the movie.  As with all books, I think it went into more detail and made the story.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I liked this movie and so did my kids great family movie for the whole movie . Great special effects . Takes you on a adventure .
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|I get it. It's GI Joe and you wish it was good. I waited until I could rent because of all the poor reviews. Bad movie is bad :(
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Never saw this one coming, from the first awkward moment to the actual friendships that was made, even forgot about Emma's other character a few times
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Could tell I wouldn't be impressed with this movie within 5 mins of watching it.  Seemed like it was cheaply made and the acting was terrible. No wonder it did so poorly at the box office.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|It didn't work we on the kindle fire. The game would freeze. I had to make several attempts to get back to the home screen. I don't want to try it again.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I'm not sure it's worth anything extra over a free version of King Office, but it was free at the time and works decently for viewing files.  You're still not going to have much luck trying to edit or create Office files on your phone.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|...the film suffered from uninteresting (read: not likable) characters. Noomi Rapace's Elisabeth Shaw was the sole character that I cared about the most. Her boyfriend was likable, but we didn't know him too well in the end. Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers was so cold and arrogant, that I couldn't wait for her to die. I could see why Idras Elba's Janek questioned her &#34;humanity&#34;. The remaining characters were either annoying or shallow enough to not care to follow. &#34;Prometheus&#34; lacked any kind of creepiness that was overflowing in &#34;Alien&#34;. I didn't mean to compare the two, but, I was hoping for more depth in the story and people. Overall, &#34;Prometheus&#34; felt more like a very convincing documentary of scientists exploring an alien world. Although, I still find it fascinating to watch from time to time.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch is well made and dependable  Not needing a battery is a plus and the watch can be worn ofr work and play.
B004SKLD9A|1.0|I wish I could have red the review below.<br />I think it is a crime to trick people into bying blu-ray movies that are of inferrior quality to dvd editions.<br />Amazon must indicate the 2.0 sound in product description.<br />SHAME on your Greed!<br /><br />1.0 out of 5 stars Never Buy This Waste Blu-Ray May 12, 2011<br />By PARK SANG TAE<br />Format:Blu-ray Amazon Verified Purchase<br />Never, Never, Never Buy This.<br /><br />Video - This blu-ray is 1.78:1, by cutting 2.35:1`s side!<br /><br />Sound - This blu-ray has only one sound track,<br />This track is 2.0ch, not 5.1ch!!!<br /><br />Special Features - Nothing.<br /><br />Subtitles - Nothing.<br /><br />This blu-ray is not blu-ray.

1451695195|5.0|I was raised in a Christian enviroment with loving yet discilplned parents...in other words,when my Dad said &#34;jump,&#34; i didnt even ask how high, I just jumped...and my Mom backed his every word..turned out I rasied my only son(now 33,)  the same way...and he turned out to be a fine young man raising a fine family...what does all this have to do with the book?  Because,as with Anita Moorjanis book,it challenges our religious beliefs that we hold so dear..that htere will be a Judgement Day.And how we behave now determines where we will end up ...but not so according to this doctors NDE...everyone's spirit will be accepted...we are all truly loved...we cannot make a mistake and you have nothing to fear...this book really altered my long held deeply rooted feelings...for the better ...I recomend  it to those with an open mind about their religious beliefs...
B004HWYTP4|2.0|I just never got into it.  A bunch of loud noises interrupted by hard to hear dialog which was only of interest maybe one or two times.
B00A83075M|5.0|saw it in the theater and knew it was one we would have to buy.  parents, 12 year old and 7 year old all enjoy watching this together.  great family movie.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is never slow. It's the funniest thing ever. The new game is soooooooo fun because it's not a paid app.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Trying to keep up with what is happening with each character takes concentration but the effort is worth it.  Great book
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|A must see action, comedy flick. Really great value.. Got the 3 d, blu ray, DVD and digital download plus movie sound track all for around 20 bucks
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Love the short chapters in this book, it really help because it is such a big book.  Can't wait to find out what happens in Book 2 and beyond
B00992CF6W|4.0|My son is obsessed with this game.  It's all he will talk about lately.  He does say it doesn't have all the features of the x-box version.  I totally don't understand the appeal, and I do limit his use, but if it will keep him happily occupied at the doctor's office I am ok with it.
B00D7JGL36|4.0|I love ya Vince and respect your traditional roots. AND I love it that you're tackling the Bakersfield sound. Unfortunately I've heard Dwight Sings Buck and there is no comparison in passion and delivery. This is nice, easy to listen to, and the pickin' is good. Vince's voice is it's usual smooth high tenor. If you're a fan, like me, you'll enjoy this ...but I expected so much more.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|As usual, the problem was solved, Thank you. Your customer service is awesome! The kindle fire was not holding a charge and now its okay.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 6 y/o and 5 y/o granddaughters love this game and it holds their interest for a long time.  The only thing they don't like is the delay in the game caused by the intro video.
0062127241|5.0|Great read. Pete is so honest to the reader it's really a pleasure to read. He is human by all means and his ups and downs is what makes this an inspirational book to read. It's not the typical autobiography where the authors life is always great. It shows all sides.<br />I was surprised to see negative reviews stating all he talked about were his boats, etc,. He did but that's a part of him and he wasn't bragging or uppity about it. I loved the parts about THE WHO and Keith and John. I mean I'm sure he could have told more stories about life in THE WHO, maybe he will write another book!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This was a well written book with an interesting story but especially so because we got some insight into how life went in America and in Africa for someone from a black culture
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love being able to pick different sounds as my mood changes - can have just one or a combination.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I really tried to get into this book. Kept picking it up and reading a few more pages but ultimately, I felt like JK took the first few chapters of HP and embellished upon them to create this. It's like reading about Vernon Dursley and the drivel that is his life. I understand that some people enjoy this as a character study and maybe if I was so invested in the miserable lives of the lowest of society, this would have been fascinating but I don't take time out of my day to get depressed by the sadness of characters in a book. I don't feel that there is a clear protagonist and antagonist in this book so it makes it hard to grasp on to anything going on or to even care for this collection of people. Just really depressing and sad. Better to escape to a world of hope.
B0064MGU98|5.0|good acting, drama interesting on-going, basic plot doesn't get stale. 10 more words required? Ever hear of short and sweet.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Watched it for the first time in 20 years.  Still makes me cry!  Cruise and Hoffman are both incredible in this movie.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Story sped along at the right pace and was the perfect combination of comedy, drama, and romance. FINALLY someone to tell women what men really think---instead of what we'd like them to be thinking. Delivered in a quick-witted, funny style completely from the male point-of-view. Drew is definitely a character you'll want to get Tangled with! Can't wait for more from Emma Chase
B005LAIIHG|5.0|this is a great movie i could watch this movie every day i really love it thank you so much
B0054SMID0|5.0|This is simply the best movie to date for Matthew McConaughey! Very, very good movie! You will love this if you like intrigue and drama!
B001HPP2XW|5.0|this is a great movie i could watch this movie every day i really love it thank you so much
0071422943|5.0|Great condition and it is a necessary item in the chemical engineering world. Use it all the time during my work.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|this is a great movie i could watch this movie every day i really love it thank you so much
B000HEVALC|1.0|BUY 4 OF THOSE CD LINTON ONE BAD  TRAST THEM WOULD WASTE TIME GIVE TO FRIEND  I STILL UPSET WITH THOSE CD
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Never miss an episode if at all possible. If I do, I catch up on it here! 5 stars for sure!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Chess free is a great game, but the computer is kind f hard. I wouldn't recommend this game to people who are just learning to play chess. The two player is really fun though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think through scenarios in original ways.  It is entertaining yet makes you think about real what if's.
0307744434|3.0|I really cannot tell what I missed in this book based on the other reviews.  It just seemed like the plot wasnt there, or didnt connect in the end.  I need some more suspense - or questions, something, anything.  The book was beautifully written, I could vividly imagine every scene, the circus, beautifully.  In the end, the plot, was flat.  I was disappointed.
B007W4F6M4|4.0|...and then you want to slap the daylights out of these nasty little characters. Beasts. Except, perhaps, Ewan and Jonny, the Lovelies. An upper of an ending which leaves you with a smile at closing credits. But just smiling at the thing kind of creeps you out.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is addicting and great for people who like to multitask in games. Match 3,4, or 5 tiles to do the commands and upgrade your hero to be a beast.
B00499NHLC|1.0|Really? This is the brava BBC Sherlock offering? It looks like a middle school production with S. Holmes sweeping around the stage in his father's coat. And, oh. The plots. I wonder if the writers were enhancing their character crafting and storyline twists via the ingestion of mass quantities of hallucinogens? Hmm. Maybe anyone watching this thing needs her/his own 7% solution to make it through to the other side.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Great story full of surprises right to the end, wonderful characters and a very believable plot. i can recoomend this
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Boring. Boring. Boring. The first 45 minutes or so were like dying. People keep hiring James Franco to act though he has yet to do a film where he demonstrates any ability. Yawn. The monkeys were cute in their little Philip Morris hats and tops, but there's not much else to recommend the thing. I think it went to DVD shortly after release. Not good news for a $350,000,000 production. Can't imagine they'll ever make it back. Anyone who can last through one viewing will need thumb screws to hold him in his seat for the second.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is very thrilling and puts your brain to the true test. It makes you think about everything you do.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|This book was a big disappointment.  Loved the others and expected the same level of masterful writing.  Hard to follow and no depth.  Written like a 6th grader
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like it that this app is free. I think that free is the way to go. I will recommend this to other people.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|First of all, I like science fiction. However, I have never read any sci-fi book; therefore, this is my first book. Secondly, I am still learning English. With these in mind, I find this book rather hard to read. The detail is too much while I can only grasp a big picture at the end of each cluster of details. In fact in some scene, I could hardly imagine the overall picture without rereading it many times. However, for a starter like myself to both sci-fi genre and English, I find this book rather fascinating because of the process of the voyage and the questions, I believe, implied. Hopefully, I will be able to complete the series.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|This is a neat item. I will tell others about this item. It is not expensive at all. I think that app at .99 cents is the way to go
B004UID2LC|3.0|tried but cant download everything for free i would say tubemate is better lets ya get everything free of youtube,
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I read the book hoping that the author would share the wisdom he had learned from his near death experience.  As I read on and on, I grew more and more disillusioned.  He mentions ineffable experiences, but refrains from sharing them.  Instead, he focuses on how miraculous his coming back to consciousness was from being in a coma.  In short, I was left hanging.  My suggestion is that it isn't even worth reading.
0770437400|5.0|I love how this book is broken up. each story is entertaining and offersa differentkind of reading experience. men will
159463176X|5.0|Really liked the descriptions of every day life.  The characters were well developed.  I really cared about the family and felt so sorry for the brother and sister separated in the childhood.
B000MQCSBQ|2.0|This is one of my favorite movies EVER!, my disappointment comes from me not being able to watch the DVD on my DVD Player the only way for me to get the movie to play, is by watching it on my laptop...which is NOT GOOD when I sometimes wanna watch it on the BIG SCREEN TV !!!..major let down with that one.
030758836X|5.0|I was so sure the wife was the &#34;good guy&#34;, the ending really shocked me.  This book held my interest throughout.
B000059MEL|5.0|Knew I had to have this as soon as I saw it. Everything was perfect. Sounds great, but almost too good. Waiting for the dust to settle :)
B00007E7K0|5.0|Fits tight, No slop, exactly like the original cap for my 18-55 mm kit lens which, as I'm sure you have too, I lost.
B002LAAB1U|5.0|I have always enjoyed solo piano music and the nature sounds in the backround enhance the entire experience.  Great buy!
0142000671|3.0|purchased this book for my 9th grader, don't think it was a very memorable read, probably will not read it again
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its so addictive and its one of the best games I have ever played on my kindle
B004HWYTP4|4.0|cool premise, no one really thinks of what happens to these spies in the movies when they get to retirement age
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Didn't satisfy my requirements need to be able to read documents in page form. Wish description of product gave more information
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I was going to use this app for my school on my Kindle fire, but it does not work for me. I downloaded so I could store and school work, and my book stuff. Nothing worked!!
B008B1BL4E|5.0|The propaganda we have been raised on, about the wicked German's is washed away by the facts. They just fell into it as in a bad wreck without any real thought with consequences that we live with to this day. War is so stupid, and those idiots in uniform should be in cages.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Having yet to read the book, I watched the film mainly as an illuminator for the novel, which I am now eager to start. I can only say that LIFE of PI is like no other film that I have ever seen. I expected it to be good but also feared it might have some of those fluffy \\"Oh, aren't I deep and brilliant?!\\" qualities. My fears proved baseless. LIFE of PI incorporates mystical and philosophical themes very well without detracting from its engaging, hypnotic storyline. It's also touching and poignant without being the least bit sentimental. Despite a few choppy bits, there isn't a seriously dull moment here. Suraj Sharma/Irrfan Khan play the protagonist quite convincingly, but it's the fine cinematography that really makes this film. Absolutely stunning views of the ocean and its life and, of course, Richard Parker the tiger and various other animals.
B00980IA3M|4.0|I bought this collection because it has every opera Wagner ever composed. Sort of a reference work. all of the opera's are good and mixed. None are the best but all are OK. I am glad I own this set. I do own much better Rings but this adds to my collection. It was also reasonable and I will leave it in my car.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Great Movie to watch
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I like the game because it tests your reasoning ability very much like sudoko.<br />I have only played it a few times and am still learning how to beat it.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This was great for people who want to spend some time strengthening their deductive skills. For anyone with a basic understanding of puzzle games this will pose a great challenge. 9 Multi stage puzzles in 10 levels. I had fun with this game and hope a sequel comes soon.
B000P407K4|5.0|Peter Sellers in multiple roles!  Biting anti-nuclear-war sarcasm!  Every young person should see this.  Plus such dialog as, &#34;You can't fight in here - this is the war room!&#34;
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie, well written and acted. After a prophecied baby is born to end the time of tyranny from the evil queen, a &#34;peck&#34; Willow from a small village must journey, with the help of friends, to bring her to her destiny.
B00AYB12PC|1.0|I just didn't like it at all. Watching more than I did would be a bad waste of my time.
B00CKWQN9S|5.0|If you loved the movie, you'll probably love the soundtrack. Features, Jay Z, Beyonce, Fergie, and several other artist; perfect combination of the 1920's and today.
159102594X|5.0|the first law trilogy was wonderful.  Kept me wanting to know what follows all the way through.  Hope there is more after the third book
B00BJKZVRC|5.0|Excellent clarity and multi-channel separation.. My Three favorite songs on the album are the title cut, &#34;Riders on the Storm&#34;, and Love her Madly,
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is one of those books that I needed to think about and sort of digest before I could write about it. It's that good.<br /><br />Who amongst us doesn't worry about what secrets our loved ones will discover about us after we die? Perhaps a stray email or a photo that looks suspicious. Some of us even write letters to our families, letters they only can read after we die.<br /><br />That is the premise for this strong, solid book: Cecile happens upon a letter written in her husband's handwriting, addressed to her, and stating that it is to be opened upon his death. Unfortunately, she finds it while he's still alive.<br /><br />Cecile manages to put off opening the envelope; those of you in need of a speedy resolution need to reconnect with your patience, because we do not learn the contents of that envelope until about 200 pages in. By that point, we know Cecile, dynamo stay-at-home mom and Tupperware saleswoman. She's the sort who makes and freezes two lasagnes, returns umpteen emails, and schedules appointments all before her husband and children wake up. That she does it with a smile and aplomb makes her even more enviable. But we like her, if only because she admits that she occasionally parents better when there is an audience.<br /><br />We also have gotten to know Tess, who runs an advertising agency with her husband Will and cousin Felicity. Tess and her cousin have been best friends since they exited their wombs, although Tess wonders how much of that friendship was a boost to her own ego because Felicity was morbidly obese until about six months ago. She lost a lot of weight, became gorgeous, and Tess is happy for her. Happy, that is, until Will and Felicity announce they are in love.<br /><br />Then there is Rachel, a seventy-year-old school office worker who continues to struggle, over thirty years later, with the unsolved murder of her daughter. Rachel revels in her grandson, whom she can dote on and adore. But then her son announces that his wife has accepted a job in New York, halfway across the world from their home in Sydney, Australia, and Rachel plummets into sadness.<br /><br />The three women's stories overlap, and we slowly become aware of how. There is a mystery here - who killed Rachel's daughter - and its solution unleashes catastrophic consequences. Moriarty frames her story with that of Pandora, asking if Pandora was all that smart in opening up the box. That becomes one of the central questions: are we better off knowing each other's secrets, or is ignorance truly bliss?<br /><br />Just as gripping as the mystery is the sense of pending doom for Cecile, Tess, and Rachel. Moriarty tends to this mood of suspenseful despair by taking us fully into the minds of her characters. We know Cecile's desperation to understand her husband. We grieve with Rachel. We feel anger and frustration with Tess. As they maneuver their ways through these few weeks of their lives, their search for contentment becomes important for us as well. Therein lies Moriarty's success as a writer: she makes us care.<br /><br />While the Pandora allusion works, there are two other metaphors at play that are more intriguing. Cecile's daughter is obsessed with the Berlin Wall, and as she learns more about it, she is surprised to discover that some East and West Germans were nonplussed with the wall's destruction; they were comfortable with it, and the freedoms its removal ushered in discomfited them. We understand this, especially as Cecile confronts the letter.<br /><br />Perhaps the more intriguing metaphor, however, is Cecile's job. It is no accident that she sells containers. Cecile's life is all about containment and storage, with each piece knowing its spot. Oldest daughter Isabel's burgeoning womanhood disturb's Cecile because it does not fit; she needs to create a new container for this part of parenting. When she learns what her husband wanted her to know only after his death, she must confront the dismantling of all of her storage bins. They burst open and force her to reorganize her carefully arranged life.<br /><br />You will find yourself asking several \\"what ifs\\" as you read this book. What would you do? How would you react?<br /><br />You also will find yourself wondering what your family will discover about you when you die.<br /><br />Thanks to edelweiss for the preview.<br />Published on cupcake's book cupboard<br />@VivaAmaRisatatorage bins.

B000KC2CC2|5.0|Excellent clarity, great multichannel separation. I bought the SACD's of  &#34;The Doors&#34;, &#34;Strange Days&#34;, &#34;Morrison Hotel&#34; and &#34;L.A. Woman&#34; over a 3 week period beigining with a pre-order of &#34;The Doors&#34; to make sure I was getting good multichannel and clarity and after hearing it, bought the rest. I love.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry birds is the best game ever. Never any problems, always works like a charm. Exciting and adventurous. I highly recommend it .
B005IQZB14|5.0|I don't normally read non-fiction. I just like a good made up story. Well this was like that only it wasn't made up. A wonderful story that made me feel the spirit it took Cheryl to accomplish this journey.  A very strong and moving read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazingly fun!!! I think this is personally waayyy better than Subway Surfurs!!!!!!!!!!! it is the freaking best!!! I reccomend this to anyone that loves Minions!!! I do!!

B003O86FMW|5.0|I cant wait to read the third book. This was better than the first! This one had things i suspected, and things i did not.

B008393Q2O|5.0|got this as a free app of the day for my Kindle fire HD. I love it. I need a lot of reminders.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers fan for years...The earlier songs and body of work has stood the test of time, however as I am older now, I appreciate this album MOJO even more, it's that good!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I didn't know quite what to expect when I read this book but I was pleasantly surprised. I like how he goes between what his family was going through and what he was experiencing. Some parts toward the end were a little too technically science based but I understand he is doing this for a large audience that has that knowledge and is questioning his experience. Overall, I really enjoyed the book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging and addictive.  It offers re-do options so you can attain a perfect score on every level. Not that I need to!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this book. A new seires with Percy Jackson! But when I read this book I had to read it again  and again! This exceptal book by Rick Riordon introduces three new characters Jason,Piper,and Loe. I can't wait for Son of Neptune!
B00CATSONE|5.0|An eye opening insight into a truly wonderful genius, thankyou for writing this book and congradulations for enlightening the inner creative spirit in us all....Pez. MMXIII
1439153663|5.0|It was a book that reminds you of Gone With the Wind, Not written as well but it does keep your interest up. I thought it could of had a different ending that would have made it better. But a good read anyway
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I originally was only looking for something to store my Bluetooth in when I'm not using it so it doesn't get lost or damaged, this case does that and more... Holds the back up charge very well, and is very reliable when I'm on the road.  The best part is not having to carry around additional charging cords and have to deal with plugging it in when I'm not at home.
1439190275|5.0|I love the book I have tried other diets and they have left me cold. This one really works. I have lost 12 pounds since I received it. Yeah. Donna
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Loved how quick and easy it was to read but full of great info! Can't wait to get started on some of the suggestions.
0345535421|5.0|As someone who is a bit of a slow reader, I'm always shocked at how quickly I seem to devour George RR Martin's brick-shaped tomes. \\"A Clash of Kings\\", the second novel in his \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga, will keep you up half the night and then wake you up in the morning wanting nothing more than to pick it up and start reading again. Having seen the HBO series, I already knew what was going to happen. But I was always nothing less than completely engaged.<br /><br />As someone familiar with the primary story beats of the events covered in the novel, it's interesting to watch them unfold slightly differently in book form. One of Martin's greatest feats is the ease with which he opens his windows into the character's heads. You understand how desperately Tyrion wants to be loved, how stressed Sansa's soul is as she continues her farce in King's Landing, how empty Catelyn's heart becomes as her family disintegrates around her, how much of a wailing bag of farts Theon really is, and on and on and on. This connection with the cast, along with a sprinkling of plot twists and vivid descriptions, makes the book almost impossible to put down at points.<br /><br />That said, there are a few faults to be had here. Some of the character's arcs left something to be desired this time around. Jon Snow lives up to his name and spends most of the story hanging out...in the snow...walking. Yep, literally walking. You can only read so many descriptions of snowfall and mountain passes and winding, ice-bitten trails before your mind starts to wander a bit. Meanwhile, Dany's trip to the foreign city of Qarth is much like the city itself: gorgeous and filled with exquisite details and treats, but ultimately leaves the character almost at the exact same place as when she arrived. And Bran...well, he wasn't in this book as much as the first one, I guess? So that's a mercy<br /><br />That said, \\"Clash\\" still boasts a handful of new, interesting characters (the likable Davos, the mysterious priestess Melisandre, the despicable Ramsay Snow) that give the story the spice it needs to avoid leading the audience into boredom. Martin's flair for subtext, foreshadowing, and theme leave the reader a lot to chew on. The pursuit and disintegration of power, the danger and disaster of ego, the harsh realities of war versus the facade and pomp of chivalry at court. All these things inform the reader of Martin's world and our own. You'd think almost seventy years removed from Tolkien, sword-and-sorcery authors would have run out of things to say or tropes to overturn or character archetypes to deconstruct. Martin's song is proof that the genre can still thrill, frighten, and awaken.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Thank goodness suits came along just in time and filled the house void in my filler evening routine. I can't wait to watch season 2!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie is a bit more than you might expect.  If you're a zombie genre fan, this one is worth a look.  A new concept makes a hierarchy of zombies within the zombie community, and that really adds something to this otherwise twisted love story.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Same old conman turned hero, but adventure and cinematography were great. In todays world of movies not a bad watch.
B001UV4XUG|3.0|It arrived on time and in excellent condition. I watched it and was slightly disappointed, I expected the Movie to be better. It was boring and kind of slow, I really like the main Actors so I guess I expected the movie to be Comedy.
B006WPWH4E|3.0|I don't really have a problem with this but I have to be in the mood to play Solitaire or I can't play it

B0042TV4IW|4.0|Great family show.  So gather the family and watch all four seasons.  Much, much better than American television programming.  You will be glad you invested the time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't even begin to describe the feelings I got from this book! Once you start, you simply can't stop reading. Gideon and Eva are amazingly flawed and perfect for one another!
B009GX69RK|5.0|I started watching New Girl season 1 on Netflix and loved it so much that I had to buy season 2- and it has been just as great!
0525425772|5.0|very good
B002W1UEW4|3.0|It was a good action flick, I am very picky, so I figure that since it didn't GI JOE comic book or cartoon canon that it was good DESPITE this fact...good action sequences though...
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|A good movie to watch and sit back on a friday evening with a snack or two..<br />Totally enjoyed it..

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|i normally pass on these re-enactments of real life events: but this was unique and really quite good. worth watching.
B00985E3UG|2.0|Did not interest me I really don't<br /> Know what I thought I was getting but it wasn't what I got
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|pretty cheesy and predictable. i listened to book on audio a long time ago - it was slightly better. i guess if you re  huge twilight fan and don&#34;t mind that level of sophistication, you might go for it.
B000SEI230|5.0|Read it if you have ever felt the feel of love in your life. Nice read which explains that no matter what the situation is we could still do our best for our love
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|i should've known by he preview, but this movie was even worse than i expected. I would not recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is really fun and is a great pass time, I just wish there was different ways to earn gems, like maybe you could convert coins to gems?
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|different twist on your standard zombie movie. also has some pretty funny parts. i think that it is worth watching
B00B7Y0206|5.0|When i watch my like third video it stays loading FOREVER.PLEASE FIX THIS. P.s i that supposed to happen because i didnt get pro or is that a bug.
B001NKI60W|4.0|The movie is fabulous!  the quality of the streaming was just so so.  I've had better luck with other movies so I'll definitely try this again.

B00ADS98FC|5.0|Bought this movie LOVE this movie watched this movie 5 times in a row. It's the best movie of all time!
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies is a very well written suspense sci/fi series.  I jumped on board in season 3 and am going back thru seasons 1 and 2 to catch up.  A bit more enjoyable and better production quality than Defiance in my opinion though I watch and like both.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|O.k TAFH hmmm, just the name The Aeroplane Flies high was enough to peak my interest, a couple years back!!! I bought the original box set for $65.00 from ebay great price for a rare at the time (out of print)item. The first disc I heard was 33, I loved every track especially My Blue Heaven repeat repeat repeat. Then 1979 I love Cherry and Set The Ray (to Jerry) Ugly too amazing disc track B-sides, Zero was next Billy Corgans Bissful screams oh yeah the track Tribute To Johnny shouldent have been a single track it could have made it on Pasticho Medley, God is amazing Mouths of Babes amazing,Pennies and Marquies in Spades kick ASS. Bullet With Butterfly Wings oh yeah Cars cover Alice cooper cover great single, and then Tonite Tonite my favorite single probably with the pretty acoustic tunes from any band!!! 10/10 I just bought the re-issue for $85.00 I cannot wait to hear the demos and acousitc perfomances buy this if you love Sp
1844137872|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of Banksy's work. It also includes writings by the artist. A great gift for anyone interested in art. Very witty and thought provoking, this will definitely be displayed at the top of my book shelf.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|I got it to kill time in the AP when traveling. I like that I can turn the sounds off so  won't disturb others.
B0035LJY6C|4.0|I used to watch the TV show and I really enjoyed the movie and brought back memories.  It is actually a 4 1/2 star.
B008I43DYU|5.0|It's big and simple and easy to use. If you need a basic calculator this is a good one. Haven;t used it enough to be sure the totals are always correct, but it seems good.​
B0081336FO|5.0|I love this show so much -- I love the characters, and I am devastated that the new season hasn't even BEGUN yet. !!!  I love these actors, the quick-wit writing... just fantastic.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Every hour there is a beep and can;t figure out why. I haven;t tried to mute it...figured then I wouldn;t hear the alarm either. You have to set the Kindle to never go off if you want to be able to see the time during the night. Big numbers, easy to set.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|There are a few times when the adults speak &#34;inappropriate words&#34; for children but they are limited and appropriate in nature.  The movie speaks to older adults and is a good reminder for all of us of what we can continue to be as we grow older.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Practicing how to take a pix and then put it on FB, but so far it's a learning experience...don;t quite have it mastered.
0553103547|5.0|Graphic in the best of ways. Yes I am a huge fan of the show but it does not do the books justice (not trying to demean the show at all because it is amazing.) The books are just that much better.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Great scenes of Chicago coupled with classic blues songs and performances by some of the greatest blues and Motown singers helps make this an all time classic film!!<br />(The car chases are great, too!!)
0553108034|5.0|Graphic in the best of ways. Yes I am a huge fan of the show but it does not do the books justice (not trying to demean the show at all because it is amazing.) The books are just that much better.
0765348276|5.0|I bought this book years ago, intrigued by the idea of a war fought by old people given new bodies.  The book exceeded my expectations and it has become one of my favorite books.  The characters are well developed and the plot well thought through.<br />This book is not dark or heavy (read Midshipman's Hope if that's what you're after), though it does have those elements, but also has it's light hearted moments (what do you think you would do if you suddenly went from a 75-year-old body to a perfect, fit body just like everyone else has?)<br />If you do decide to get this book, I hope you enjoy the ride.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|I discovered Gillian Flynn after listening to a review of Gone Girl- one of my favourite books of all time. Again with this one the characters are superb, the writing artful and story line has twist after twist and not at all contrived. Again the material is gritty and  dark and very sad in places and yet it is ultimately uplifting. I couldn't recommend her work enough. this is the story of a journalist from Chicago who returns to her home town to investigate the deaths of two young girls. The  main character's self destructive personality is a major feature of this novel and how she ultimately discovers through her dysfunctional family the secret of her self disgust. It is a story of self discovery told with the background of the police and journalist investigation which leads to the solving of the crime. This is not a 'who dunnit&#34; novel. It runs a lot deeper than that. Just read it!
B0047S1KMS|1.0|This really COULD have been good. Sadly, it was ruined by over-directing and poor, choppy editing. All zombie scenes feature super-annoying shaky camera shots in order to falsely induce \\"panic\\". Not needed. Had been excited to watch but had to turn it off after 35 minutes because of the poor directing and editing. All four of us who were watching agreed.  Couldn't take it anymore. Shame, really.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Overall it works great and was easy to set up.  I like broadcasting Chrome from my PC to my TV.  My only gripe is that the output is a little delayed.
B004XISI4A|2.0|This was the most disappointing instalment yet. I have this fear that Mr Martin is running out of steam on this series and that the TV series is becoming far larger than it should to add pressure.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|This book provides an interesting insight into history and is an unusual and quirky story. It made me laugh, but it didn't have the power to grip me and I almost didn't feel like I had to finish it. It was ok
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|The character development is strong and I love this ashy world with such rich characters who burn metals. I fly and push and pull with Vin in my mind!
B00D2K40WY|1.0|Your restricted to a lot of things on here. My daughter loves the app until she remembers how many things are locked and I'm not going to make a purchase on this. There are A LOT of pop ups which is super annoying. Pop ups shouldn't be allowed in a game like this for kids.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Love all the old actrs in this. Arnold,Chuck Norris and Stallone are great fun when there all together. Would watch a third if it came out. A little slower than the 1st movie but fun to watch anyway.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Big fan of Anthony Hopkins. I wish the movie would have been more about his life and not just about the movie Psycho.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|We did not go & see this in the theater because we did not want to pay full price. It was worth the price we paid to view it this way
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I watched faceoff the tv show and love what they did with the main giant. I would watch again. Loved it!!
B005MMY9A8|3.0|We are glad we did not pay full price at the theater, but is was good story line. It also set you up for the movie The Avengers
B00AHJL7BK|1.0|it was a poor substitute for Suduku.  It was a foreign language so my husband said.  He hopes to erase it from his kindle.
0887307280|5.0|This was required reading for one of my business classes in college many years ago. I was blown away by the insight the first time I read this book. It literally changed the way I thought about and analyzed successful businesses. I've given this book away to many friends who've ventured to start their own small business, and they've found it extremely helpful as well. I've re-read it many times through myself, and always glean new tips and insight. Probably the only book I don't regret having to buy in college.
B002EXI5L2|5.0|I love all the  movies they made together.  They were the perfect movie couple.Wish they had made a lot more movies together.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|very addictive lol cant put down I wish the cooldown times were faster, and the pvp was more responsive. over all great game:) keep up the good updates and thanks for an incredible free game:)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Absolutely fun, fun, fun. You can't wait to save the next family of animals. The mini game is a challenge, but not discouraging. Appropriate for all ages.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|i have this game on my ipod and now my kindle !!!!!<br />cool game ever<br />want to scream so. uch a good way to practice saving money lots of things that are expensive
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It is a good game,but it is not the best game in the store so get a good game  not this one
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I wanted to see Red before I invested in seeing the sequel.  I usually like Bruce Willis films, and this one was no exception.  It was about what I expected.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I read this book in about a week.  It is a page turner and I can't wait for the next book to come out!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just started the game and had to stop last night because the next room required payment to open. I've read that you can play for free by signing out and playing again later. We'll see.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Although it took me some time to remember the title of the film so I could order it, I had it on my list because of the subject material - Bi-polar illness, family relationships and someone like Robert De Niro to once again share his  talent with a cast I did not know.  The male/female roles were exquisite, heart-tugging and purposeful.  All in all an extremely satisfying story about a difficult illness and our attitudes towards those who struggle to live with it.<br /><br />Thank you for including this film in Amazon Prime movies.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|It just seems it bit over the top on the quirkiness scale.  Did not like the movie at all.  Wouldn't recommend it for adults.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely admired Suzanne Collins' work. It was very intense throughout the whole series. I just love Mockingjay because of how much emotions matter in the book. I would recommend this series to anyone who would like to read something different. It's just a work of art. The one question I have for Suzanne Collins is how she came up with such brilliantly unique word to put her characters in.
B008602KQI|5.0|As epic as Star Wars and we, as a family, look forward to the future films just as equally!<br />Great cast with interesting adaptions  for film purposes to the book characters that don't take away from the story or its characters' impact.<br />Check out Lenny Kravitz who insisted on down-playing Cinna's flamboyancy in the book with the director's approval as to how Kravitz interpreted the role for screen.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So I've been using my Chromecast for about a day now and I've already gotten plenty of use out of it. The setup was simple, you go to a website and link it and name it and you're pretty much set. After that you can move it to any tv in the house and use it without a hassle. I've used both my Nexus 4 and my ipad to cast to it and it all worked pretty well. With my ipad I cast a few shows from Netflix and a few episodes of the new talk show \\"the Real\\" from YouTube. It worked beautifully.one small annoyance was that once I was streaming to the chromecast in YouTube once I clicked a video it didn't play immediately I had to hit the play button to initiate it. This was only a small annoyance however.<br /><br />I then moved the chromecast to my bedroom and with my Nexus 4 I rented a movie from the Google Play store and cast that. The integration is seamless and the hd quality was great. There were a few times when the movie had to rebuffed but it only caused maybe a 3 sec delay and only happened twice. That however was probably more due to my network speeds. I haven't tried chrome tab casting yet but once I do I'll update with my impressions.<br /><br />The chromecast comes in a neat little box with the device, a USB cable, USB ac adapter, and an hdmi adapter for those whose TVs do not have enough space to stick a dongle. The chromecast needs to be powered via USB in order to function so you must have an available USB port on your tv or you must use the provided ac adapter to plug into a wall socket.<br /><br />All in all, great device for the price. I'm going to order two more for the other rooms in my house. This will be especially useful for my 3 yr old sons room who often ask to see his favorite shows on Netflix. In the past I've had to get up and play Netflix through the Xbox or ps3 in the living room for him and then return every time he wanted to see a new show. With chromecast I can play Netflix directly in his room and control it from anywhere in the house. That, my friends, is awesome sauce. Great job Google!, my friends, is awesome sauce. Great job Google!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I just wish there was more levels. enjoyed it very much. not too hard but not too easy either. good graphics. real brain game.
B009R659L8|4.0|I always enjoy reading Mary Higgins Clark's page-turning books and this one is no exception. Although the story is somewhat far-fetched, it is still a good and quick read and keeps the reader curious about the real villain until the end. It is about a suspicious fire of a furniture building which left one of the main characters in a coma for most of the book, so her sister had to do the detective work to solve the mystery.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I like the main characters.  They are smart and funny.  The premise does bother me though because Mike will never be a legitimate lawer and I don't see how he can keep it up.  (I know it is just a movie -- that is why I am still watching it).
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the best dramas on tv!  Looking forward to Season II.  Great acting and good suspense. Award winning series
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 8 year old is great at this fun game. The minions are so cute and make us lol. A feel good game. My 6 yr old keeps asking his sister to move him up a level. They both enjoy the battles, Victor Battle!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|it's fun,exciting every new level.I like bubble witch saga  it's entertaining full of excitement and keeps me from being bored.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Captures the viewer immediately. Great stories and characters. One of the best shows on television today. I love this show.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not as good as some of the other games i have. Too old for some of these.<br />Like to try though.
B004KPX4W2|1.0|The download locked up several times, often in a very exciting part of the movie.  I was really into it, then it stopped downloading for 10 seconds the first time, 30 seconds the second time, and at least 5 minutes the third time.  I think we quit trying to watch after the 4th time it froze up in the download process.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|Was too hard for this 73 year old to do.lol Tried but going to replace it with<br />something i can do.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I watched it for the chemistry of Streisand and anyone else.  She is so precious.  I liked her overbearing manner in the movie.  I wish she would do more movies like in the 70s and 80s.
B00D41AJ7G|1.0|Why get these games for 99 c  when you can play them for free on a website called cool math games I<br />It has games like sugar sugar and bloxors
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Very cute movie.  Both my wife and I - as well as our daughter loved it.  Cute story.  Great animation!
B004UJAOLM|1.0|I didn't like this book when I was forced to read it years ago and it hasn't grown any better with my age.
0739375970|2.0|The story itself has simply flown out of control. Martin has lost his ability to move the reader through the story. There are POV chapters which seem to be present simply for the sake of being there. Martin clearly needs an editor with the ability to tell him when he is going off on too many rabbit trails.<br /><br />Roy Dotrice's narration is mostly fairly terrible. When he voices almost any female character they sound like the leprechaun from old Lucky Charms commercials. Most of the character accents sound rough and bumpkinish; it's almost as if Dotrice is only capable of doing a very few voices and he's forced to stretch his limited ability over Martin's (far) too many characters.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|While you could make a clock that has tons more features, this clock keeps it simple and works well. I recommend it.
1421550644|4.0|I found out about this set after watching the movie. I enjoyed the movie greatly because of the interesting universe that Miyazaki had crafted, as well as the cool imagery of a fungal forest taking over the globe.<br /><br />The Box set comes with two large hardcover books, and they're both contained in a nice hardcover sleeve. The books begin with some similarity to the movie, but soon after starts to deviate and takes a path of its own. I liked the story a lot, and was really surprised by how tense some of the situations turned out to be. This was helped largely by the beautiful artwork.<br /><br />Though while we're on the subject of the artwork: while absolutely stunning in most panels, sometimes it gets difficult to follow because of the amount of detail that Miyazaki put into each panel. It's a double edged sword. Other reviews have mentioned that previous versions of this manga came in the typical manga size, and I can see this book being VERY difficult to interpret if it were at that size.<br /><br />My last small complaint, and I admit it's kind of silly, is that the books are pretty big. It makes them rather inconvenient for taking with you on a trip; their size basically mandates that you have to read them at home.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great Artwork<br />Great Story<br />Complex and interesting characters<br />Beautiful looking set to display on bookshelf<br /><br />Cons:<br />Artwork can cause things to be difficult to follow.<br />Can be difficult to read on-the-go
0307341550|4.0|Having now read all three of Flynn's novels, I can see that this one is less polished than Dark Places and Gone Girl.  But it does have the most satisfying mystery and conclusion.  I like a book that keeps me surprised until the end.  This book keeps the reader on edge until the last page, and what do you know... it aint over until it's over.<br /><br />It is slower to start than the other two, I was able to put this down more easily than the other two, which are absolute page-turners.  But this book is extremely satisfying.  Many people criticize the twists in Gone Girl, but I don't think that is the case here.  However, it does not offer the alternating points of view that are so intriguing in her other work.<br /><br />Oh... this book also has the best \\"villain\\" of her works.  I think it takes some patience, and I am avoiding discussing any plot specifics, but I highly recommend this to any fan of the mystery thriller genre.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I have always enjoyed Rod Stewart.  Even though his voice has ebbed somewhat, he is a great artist.  And afterlistening to him for over 50 years, he still has it! Sincerely, Toni
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This movie blew my mind the first time I saw it! Its an awesome movie with awesome acting. Nothing more to add.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Robert Downey is a wonderful actor, and now after all of his troubles, he gets better and better.  A great performer!  His movies, such as the Sherlock Holmes series are very detailed and a joy to watch!<br />Sincerely, Toni
B005OCFHHK|5.0|We have watched the whole set on nearly consecutive nights. Its an amazing way to sell the films all over again.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I do watch this over and over, and do catch some of the details that I did not view the time before.  Great movie...can't wait until the 2nd Prometheus comes through.<br />Sincerely, Toni
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|In this Die Hard movie they've combined a father and son love story with an action film leaving out a lot of the mushy stuff. As a result the bad guy's roll is weaker and the suspense isn't nearly as good as other Die Hard films however there is a really good car chase that makes it worth seeing. It was different but I enjoyed it and look forward to number six, in the next film I hope they create a more complex bad guy that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I still give it four stars because it's Bruce Willis and it's a Die Hard movie even the Bond films have had ups and downs but I didn't come away feeling that I wasted my time watching this movie. The under forty crowd might not get this movie but there's new action stars for their generation and plenty of comic book movies for them to see.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I'm 39+ weeks pregnant and thought this movie was super funny and that all preggers out there will appreciate this movie!
B005544TRQ|5.0|face paced world of power lawyers has GREAT music and cool main character<br />that is reminiscent of Clooney in Ocean's eleven or some other slick Clooney roll.<br />Enjoyable. So glas I found this one of prime instant.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I knew exactly what I was ordering when I bought this sharpener, and it is EXACTLY what I wanted.<br />A pocket sized sharpener that can be used to rough and fine sharpen blades when you can't take along your larger/bulkier sharpening system, and it has the diamond 'spike' that can be used in MANY ways other than its intended use of sharpening of serrated blades ;)<br /><br />This product is cheap enough that it should be in everybodys 'go bag'.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Compelling characters give a glimpse of the mind of woman put in an<br />impossible situation. I want to know why she stayed with him at all.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Red was a great flick. Good story, had some decent action, and it was very funny. We're excited to the second one!
B005C7SXMS|5.0|this is a movie i could watch countless times and still love it. it's endearing and heart-breaking and all of the things you want it to be. the cinematography is spot on too with a great focus on aesthetic repetition. in a way it reminds me of harold & maude and i'd definitely say that if you enjoyed that film, you'll like submarine.
B000FC130E|3.0|I read Neil Gaiman's American Gods and was hoping this book would be a great read similar that book. I started this story and put it down after a while. I couldn't get into it for some reason. It was a little slow for me. I plan on going back to give it another try later this summer.
B000LJB9U0|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a kid, and loved it. I missed a lot of the back story then - the painful breakup of marriage, and the possibility of saving it - because I was young. But I understand and appreciate it now, along with wonderful performances from Christopher Walken, Natalie Wood, Louise Fleischer and Cliff Robertson. The cinematography is great. A number of scenes were shot at the Wright Brothers Memorial near Kitty Hawk, N.C. An added bonus: a film score by James Horner, who was early in his career. I've seen it many times.
B002ONV5E6|3.0|The first one was much better written and much better directed.  The camera work in this one could have been quite interesting if it wasn't some vomitous formula shot.  Nice photography, as well acted as could be expected from such a weak script and big budget film school-esqe direction... on the whole, I'd rather have two hours of my life back... it was worth the rental fee, good thing that was cheap!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Really like this version of Angry Birds. I play it until  the battery on my Kindle Fire dies. Recommend it to everyone.
B009I2UH2W|3.0|it was a good charger overall and works but I wish i put down money for more so i got something else. however the price is not so bad, so i cant complain.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I bought my kindle fire HD 7&#34; for this box set very good read and I will look into more from him.
B00C7KYXHW|3.0|this was interesting, i would watch it again, very good plot line. it def kileld my time not sure if its something i can follow a whole season.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a good game for my kindle fire HD 7&#34; easy to read on this screen I love it.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|This is a wonderful recording. Boz Scaggs voice, musicianship & band are great - always great. What kept me from giving it another star was that the songs seemed a bit repetitive - lacking a little mystery or depth. Hard to explain because I don't like to criticize Boz Scaggs & band. They're always pro. I will keep listening to this CD & see if it grows on me.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|I admit that I'm a bit obsesive, in that once I find an author / character I like I tend to devour all the books that are available.  This is true for the Jack Reacher series, and I'm now through the first 12.  But I may stop after Nothing to Lose.  Very disappointing, especially since the previous book was so exceptional.  This is one book that Jack Reacher fans can skip.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved it and John green is a great writer. The kind of writer I hope to be someday. Also 'Okay'
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is really funny.<br />The main character Greg is always getting himself in trouble.<br />This book is really awesome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book even although it is not really my type of book. Very enjoyable to read. I watched the film afterwards and the book is 100 times better
B00A50PBEA|5.0|Kenneth Brannagh's adaptation of The Magic Flute is magical indeed!  The story line has been moved to the World War One era, but the concept is so clever, so illuminating, that it actually adds a completely different element to the beloved Mozart opera.  The cast is top-notch (Rene Pape!)and the conducting is brilliant.  You will love it--get it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very good - especially if you have read the first book. Lots of twists and worth a read. Highly recommend it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Another great show from USA - the storylines continue to build each of the characters throughout the season.  Harvey and Mike are great at balancing the two conflicting sides in each of us.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I nearly gave up on this book in the first chapter but am glad that I did not as it is a brilliant book. Very cleverly written and lots of twists. Would highly recommend it. the ending is very unpredictable.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It is edge of your seat amazing. Leaves you dying for more.  Winter is her... and  so are the dragons.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as good as the first two books. A bit too lengthy with not much happening. But good to read to finish off the story
140006922X|5.0|Great read if you have proper education. Not the best book If you are a brain washed Fox News Zombie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun I can't stop playing this game I just got it and it's my new favorite game
B008CP6RWU|4.0|I enjoyed Journey and Flower, short games but worth it I think. Calming, which is rare when it comes to gaming.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|all the details of furniture, customs, clothing, accents--recreated a world of just a century ago which is mostly gone.  Well done.
B00E193Y36|5.0|I been a fan back when they first appeared on the music scene. Now the last three albums and the track they did on the movie Avengers where great albums. This album is by far the best yet. I can only imagine what part 2 is going to sound like.  So yeah this album is worth every penny and more .
B008Y78M60|4.0|The movie gave me a lot of history with plenty of action, scenery and decent acting. The only negative was the dialogue was not always clear because there was too much background noise
B00516G5W0|5.0|This Zoro figure is awesome and would make a great addition to anyone's One Piece collection! Buy this awesome figure!
1576875776|5.0|To friends. I didnt think about what I was expecting, but this surely exceeded it.Lived up to the programme, if that is possible.
0670026182|5.0|The first thing you notice about this cookbook is the gorgeous photography.  I flipped through the entire thing before even looking at the recipes.<br /><br />The second thing you notice is how everything is so detailed and concise and dummy-proof.  The couple of recipes I've tried have been wonderful.  This is a great addition to my cookbook collection.
B008NMT684|5.0|My grandson loves it. It teaches him eye hand coordination and being a boy loves the different trucks.<br />Great for sitting down and having some quiet time
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|What a great guy with a wonderful voice. This is the first album I have purchased of his. I did it for a couple of reasons. I have fallen in love with his personality and sense of humor on The Voice. His performances on The Voice, whether it be his own songs or singing with others, are really good. I love Amazon has samples of the music for most of the albums. After listening to this one it was a must have for me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally worth the wait! I'm only on episode 4 and it keeps getting better. Great cast old and new, although Mary has changed a bit.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Mr. Rucker has once again out done himself.<br />Great mix of rock,country and sweet fun music.<br />Put it in, turn it up and go for a drive!
B003204MQS|3.0|Aufficiently creepy. No gore. Typical suspense film but not really horror. Would make you afraid of the dark to walk to bed after watching it but the creep factor decrease immensely in a second viewing.
140006922X|5.0|This is an excellent read.  Quite interesting.  I have previously read DECLARE the Islam Saga and Terrorism, and this book helps to put that one into perspective.  They are complementary reads I would say.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I couldn't even get halfway through.  It was abysmal.  The cgi was pretty but the story was weak and the script was awful.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Royalty addictive, I can't put it down! Graphics. Are awesome. Can't wait to get a great white. More sharks please.
B00821OX98|2.0|I guess it falls in more of the same scripts of many apocalyptic view of distant future movies. It is ok, but it did no catch my interest.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Everyone insisted that I read this book.  I liked it but it is really dark and twisted.  It is a page turner though.  First book that I've read that I didn't like the characters at all.  It's interesting to say the least.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As a sequel to his first novel, &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; is a worthy companion.  I'm looking forward to his next book.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|This show is the perfect mix of corny Sci Fi and dinosaurs. I don't who wouldn't love it. I cant wait for season 6.
1616551607|5.0|This is such a gorgeous, sturdy product. 3 hardbound books in a hardcover, doored slipcase that have just been presented so beautifully. I have only just started peeking through this, but I'm in awe.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|I love this series!!  I work in politics and so I thought this would likely be way off but I was surprised at how honest it is.  Kevin Spacey is great and I love the way he turns to the camera and talks directly to the viewer.  Can't wait until the 2nd season starts!  More please!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book to see what all the hype was all about, especially since I am a Twilight fan.  If this Christian guy was supposed to be anything like Edward, she missed the boat on that.  How are we supposed to believe that an intelligent college grad, who is also a virgin, would subject herself to such treatment, both in and out of the bedroom.. Save yourself the time, money and the mental mind scrub that you'll have to do after reading it.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Do not like apps that say free and you are VERY limited to what you can do.<br />Especially when your kids BEG for all the extras!!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is a gud product if you are only using to stream Netflix or you tube . Although streaming from the chrome Browser is beta , I would expect a better product coming with a GOOGLE tag .<br /><br />Streaming any video from the browser on to the TV has serious lag and audio sync issues . Was  a total disappointment . I would retain Roku over Chromecast anyday , unless the Browser support issues have been rectified .
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|As I was reading this I couldn’t help but feel Pam tapping me on the shoulder saying, paying attention, I wrote this for you - Action and reaction are equal; and the person who steadily and purposefully moves forward with a clear outcome in view becomes a center toward which the thing he seeks is drawn with irresistible power. Health, happiness, power and abundance are residual effects. The cause lies with you, brought into outward manifestation through planning, imagination, hard work and perseverance. You change your circumstances by changing yourself. By making causes with inner strength and determination, you can change the path you’re on.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Fleetwood Mac is one of the super groups. This compilation of their hits is timeless. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|this movie was wonderful, starting from the cast and the plot of the movie... i would recommend it to everyone to at least watch it once  you wont regret it
B00006JSS8|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved Stevie's music. Now that he has put himself into the political arena I am sorry that I endorsed him. To bad Stevie I used to be a fan but you drew a line in the sand!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is like Farmville for dragons, only your dragons never die.  You breed two dragons and can't wait to see the egg you will get.  Review by Tim's wife.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|When I first installed the game I fell completely in love with it.. and now a few weeks later a new update comes out and it won't let me on... I even deleted the game off my kindle and reinstalled it and it STILL won't let me play claiming that I have to update it before I can get on.. And I have my kindle set up to automatically update my apps.. so... what the heck! I would love it if someone could fix this problem. Cuz I very much enjoyed playing this game...
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I luv this app! whenever I turn on my kindle fire I go straight to this app.so many pets to collect also. the pets are so adorable. anyone who tries it will love it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It kept me in suspense.  Never a dull moment with Fifty.  There always someone out there that has the ability to change your life around.  I would recommend for adults to read.  You can learn a thing or two.
B00190KZUU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It's truly a great story. Tim burton tells a beautiful story. This is one movie I can watch over and over again.
B000SW2F80|4.0|The vignettes play out like a Creepshow comic book issue that comes to life and that pretty much sums up the acting, special effects, and scare factor -- comic book. I remember being scared as a kid when this originally came out, so now I wonder if I'm jaded by the level of gore / scare of today's movies, or if latex make-up just looked more frightening in the 80s. A little something for everyone (zombie, beast, bugs... lots of beyond the grave revenge). Not exactly a classic, but an enjoyable cheese plate.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Blu-ray looks great and the movie holds up as a true classic.  It is a genuinely fun watch! Worth buying.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I'm always misplacing my cords. It's great to have a spare. This one does what it was meant to do.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|This remastered set truly brings back the feelings I felt when I played the grooves off of my vinyl edition back in the late seventies.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|What a  fun game. it starts out easy but becomes challenging as you go further. I'm going to go as far as saying it's one of my favorite games on my Kindle HD.
B004GYY714|4.0|it could improve on areas of the world, say aisa, south pacific areas. other than that its great. keep it up
030758836X|4.0|To me the book was really good.  But I felt like the editor or someone told the author the book was getting too long so the author just ended it, thud.  That is just my opinion.<br /><br />I presently live in the Ozarks and I have to say the author pretty much nailed the rural hill areas!
B0011Z76RS|5.0|This was one of the first and only CDs I ever bought. I have the original in storage but, hey, these guys deserve to get paid again. I never hear anything bad about them and I really like the guy from Fort Minor.  I need to go get that song again, too.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book really touched me because I could really understand and feel everything that was going on. I started reading this book because I had to for school but it turned out to be my favorite book ever! Auggie is such a strong character that goes from everybody being mean to him to everyone wanting to hang out with and people were ready nice to him in school by he time the book was over AND people even protected him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I think this is one of his best books, great story and characters.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I have read anything of his and it made me remember why I like his work.<br /><br />Anthony
B00985E3UG|5.0|Insightful read about how the food industry hooks us. I think this is a must read for people who are interested in health.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|1) Star Trek<br />2) (:<br />3) Awesome<br />4) Some say there's gaps in logic with the plot. How? Kirk found the Botany Bay in TOS which eventually led to The Wrath of Khan later in Kirk's life. In this movie, Admiral Markus found the Botany Bay. This is Kirk's first time meeting Khan in this alternate universe AND Khan is still the same as when Kirk first met him in the original timeline because THE TIMELINE CHANGED CENTURIES AFTER KHAN WAS FROZEN!<br />5) The reason Spock is veering away from logic is because his home is Earth, which in the original timeline it was with Vulcan (which is gone in the alternate timeline).<br />6) This movie wasn't created for old trek fans. It strayed from the original path for the new generation! A lot of people don't like the old Treks because it's boring to the new generation.  Out of all of the people I met in high school, zero of them like the old stuff. However, they do love J.J.'s action packed thriller in space! I believe his goal was to use modern technology in implement it in a way to make the movie more interactive with this new generation, which worked(:<br />7) So far out of all the people who've seen this movie, much fewer have hated on it than those who enjoyed it, and most of those who did hate it claim to be trekkies from an older generation and that J.J. has ruined the entire franchise. I'm a huge trek fan from the new generation (as I was born in the early '90s) myself. I've watched every episode of every series and have played many of the computer games that have been released. I love Star Trek. It inspires me to pursue a career in which I can hopefully assist in the trigger of manned space exploration. Out of all the people I've personally met, none have hated either of J.J.'s movies. So before you dismiss this movie because you've seen those few hate responses to the movie, give it a try, you won't be disappointed! As for me, I look forward to a third and a fourth and hopefully by the fifth, I've invented a wayto utilize matter and antimatter and watch the movie in the comforts of a large space ship on the other side of the galaxy.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It could have been done better.  There were parts that I didn't care for and some that weren't bad.  Don't know if I would watch it again though.
B006ISG9XA|5.0|I really appreciate all of the footnotes. They are very helpful and informative! A library copy was not as helpful, so I appreciate my Kindle purchase of it.
145162445X|5.0|Lawrence makes a very compelling case for how we are all connected to the beginnings of the universe and how what we think of as nothing is teaming with potential energy. From the big bang, to black holes, dark energy and dark matter the reality of the universe is much wilder and more imaginative than most fiction. Human beings are literally made from star matter and in this way we are a part of the ever evolving story of the universe. It's a great read.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|This takes me back to my parents and grandparents time. The clothes, probation, gangsters and the First world war. Great actors.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Works great; however if you are not familiar with TOSLINK cables remember to remove the protective covers over the cable ends or otherwise the cable will not fit into the socket.
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|Hesher, helped me deal with my own issues. There is something about this movie that pulls the scabs off, and starts the healing.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Thanks for such a fun and interactive way to learn about how powerful we truly are.  I loved the wit and truth woven throughout each page!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Fun story but easy read. Even on a tight schedule, one is able to finish within two days.Never the less, the story line is engaging and the characters, especially Mr. Reacher, are likeable. Lots of action thru and thru.
B00DHNJCKQ|1.0|Only Noomi Rapice is watchable in this movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone to rent. There are many others worth watching
0553801473|5.0|For being a used item, this book arrived in great condition. This was definitely a good purchase especially considering the very low price. This usually costs $35.00 in bookstores so this is a good deal.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Both my wife and I fell asleep watching this and we never finished watching it. that's how bad it is.
0895260131|1.0|the worst book I have ever read its full of lies. totally wasted my money on it. the claims in the book is unreal and the author is an ignorant religious bigot. 1 of the most dishonest books in America . its a book of propaganda.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is easy and fun to get coins so that I can build more shops. It also is easy to get to higher levels so that it took only a couple of hours to get the different ponies that I wanted.  My only problem is that my big brother wants to play it as much as I do!!
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Brought me back to my childhood. I'm enjoying playing the game, but I'm disappointed with the freeze ups and losing the credits. It adds up. I have bought several packages and when it froze up lost the credits. Also, not receiving the coins at the end of the weekly contest. I was in the top 200 and was supposed to receive 5000 coins and DIDN'T receive any! What the @&amp;+# UP!!! So sad, because I have been having a blast playing the game and making UNO Friends! Give the GAME 5 Star's, but give the system 2. Star's!!  Fairestintheland!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Very inspirational. Jodi Picoult is a favorite author of mne.<br />Her research is awsome. Totally recommend this book. Looking sorward to reading all of her books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|whould highly recommend it for those minecraft fans coolest game ever in history the price is high but its really worth it
B005LHOKFS|5.0|We use this on every trip we take. It has made the finding of places fun and without problems.  If you want to know where you are going to eat or spend the night - this is invaluable.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This was a good book. The story was entertaining and original while still being a spoof of a classic. My only complaint was how much the story teased at the fourth wall. While it didn't actually break it, it certainly knocked on it a lot. This made it difficult to keep myself immersed in the story. Using the \\"because-it's-in-the-script\\" excuse as an actual plot device was certainly inventive. I would recommend this book.
B00197POXG|5.0|This is one series I have been wanting to get for awhile.  The acting is superb with the moral lessons in each episode make it a lasting series to enjoy the rest of my life.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|cant wait for the next one to come out.  It helps to read the first 2 but not necessary tho
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I preferred the third book as it contains a bit more action and content than the first and also the second one. There's still a good amount of \\"sizzling\\" going on, but not as exaggerated as in the first two books.<br />Also, Christian is more romantic and a more \\"normal\\" person, which makes the book really nice to read.<br />Obviously, we are not talking about sophisticated literature here, it is a nice, entertaining book you can read on weekends or after work to just relax and get your mind out of the routine.
B004G5ZY7E|3.0|This book is well written but meanders around trying to convince the reader that various person were responsible for the crime when, in fact, they are not.  I give it a 3, but it is really a 2.5 due to the unnecessary plot twists that are not justified by the facts related up to the time of the twist.
B004KPX5GC|5.0|Our family really loves this movie!  A family favorite movie about a horse that beats all odds and expectations, with the horse owner showing that winning isn't everything.  It's a movie that shows passion for horses, emotions and thrills that come with winning in the last second, and motivation and encouragement to never give up in life.  I highly recommend this movie!
B000TKFJRU|4.0|A must read for anyone who has experienced injustice, loss or grief. This book changed my idea of forgiveness. This is a story I will never forget.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Very good. Family fun. Kind of like Hoodwinked, but with Santa, Easter Bunny, Tooth fairy and others.  Jack Frost is just misunderstood.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a fun game that does provide a little challenge to a beginner player.<br />I would play it more if there were more levels
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was the first person to purchase this item at the local Best Buy.  I was really pleased, and rushed home to try it out on my \\"Smart TV\\".  It offered NOTHING that was not already built into the Smart TV.  I had been told by my \\"techie\\" friends that this device would mirror the content on my laptop.  Wrong!!  It does YouTube and Netflix, and that's about it.  I guess that if you don't have a smart TV or a ROKU, this thing would be of some value.  For me, it's going back.  Too bad, 'cuz the sales lady was REALLY nice and spent a lot of time looking for the device.  Anyone know of a device that really does screen mirroring?
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game! You progress from level to level by completing missions and earning XP. It is fun to get rewards that you earn by working hard! Get It!
140006922X|5.0|21.9% of the current five-star customer reviews for Reza Aslan's title \\"Zealot: the Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" are Amazon Verified Purchasers, 2.6% of the current one-star reviews for Zealot are Amazon Verified Purchasers. I think there may be a large number of Christians bearing false witness...
B004EBBPU0|4.0|Val Kilmer is Jim Morrison reincarnated in this must see for any Doors fan. Brings back the magic of this time in our history
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Bought this film for my wife as a Christmas gift; I was having a hard time finding this movie on DVD anywhere! But Amazon had it, and now I have it, too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son plays this game and absolutely loves it, and that he can go many places and you can earn better costumes for the minions.  Would highly recommend this game
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I bought this film for my family to watch on Christmas Eve, and it was a smashing success! My kids loved it, and I cannot wait for next year when we watch it all together again!
B00BC24NT4|4.0|typical le carre. convoluted with ambiguous ending but still enjoyable. fans should continue to follow him. He gets to the 21st century.
B0045HCIYA|4.0|The film suggest exactly what the film is filled with, but even with all of the nudity and the pole dancing, this film does have a nice story to tell.
B008HJGPVO|1.0|This item simply does not work.  I bought two of these, one for my wife and the other for myself.  Neither one was very effective.  Your finger will give you far better results than this does and it wont cost you anything.
B000089QCA|5.0|another hard to find film that Amazon had, and the price was more than decent for such a great film.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Love that you dont have to necessarly spend real money in the game. Graphics are stunning and beautiful and lovely music and sound effects too!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A story of a true hero that has overcome multiple issue of his own to be the best of the best. What a great tribute to Adam Brown, his teammates and family.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I have done a lot of camping,climbing, and boating so i've had a use for several types of knots. this app makes it very easy to learn and remember how to tie a variety of knots. you can slow down and pause the animation as well as rotate the knots to see them from different angles. I have let several folks who have little experience with knots try and tie a few and they have little trouble. you won't be disappointed
0307730700|5.0|If you read the books or saw the movie, or think you know all there is to know about the night they killed OBL, think again. Read &#34;Fearless&#34; to learn the truth about one man's inside story that is all about that night, even though he was never there.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The Graphics in the game are good and it provides mindless entertainment. Overall I think it is a Good game
0316067938|5.0|I think book four was just as good as book one.  All of the books were so good I couldn't put them down.
B0097JYVAU|3.0|An interesting start but tended to be a bit specialized on games.I thought his differentiation of risk and uncertainty very good.<br />Clearly knows his stuff but more everyday examples would have been more entertaining.
B009RH9J7W|3.0|The stand does not give a good angle for reading when placed on a desktop.  It needs to tilt back more for better viewing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|By this point in the trilogy, I am in love with the characters and the story line.  But honestly, I could do without the explicit details of their bedroom affair.  This really is a great story though.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love Firefly, and rewatch it every year. It has great characters, great writing, fun stories and realistic science fiction future world.
B004QL7K70|5.0|Good movie .one that you can watch over & over again . Saw it at the movies first , but wanted to buy it to watch at home whenever . So glad I did
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Bad picture. Downloaded the HD version.  Pixelation and audio issues. Other movie downloads from Hulu etc have no issues. Went in and out of HD quite a bit.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This was just what I needed to make notes directly on my Kindle so I can keep up with my authors and their series.
140006922X|2.0|Charles Spurgeon, a popular evangelist preacher from the 1800's, once said that the average person will gladly talk to you about any world religion, except Christianity. There is a lot to be understood from that. People love to talk, but they don't like to change. People want to hear about things that can be conformed to their world; but they don't want to hear about things that can't. The Christ of the Bible doesn't assimilate to today's world. Instead, he demands that you assimilate to God's word. For this reason people hate to hear about Jesus; he is the puzzle piece that doesn't fit anywhere. He's the stumbling block for our everyday lives.<br /><br />The reason why \\"Zealot\\" is so popular is because it takes the Christ of the Bible and turns him into a figure that can be assimilated. It turns Jesus into an average religious figure that can fit into the history books. A \\"historical Jesus\\", one that is stripped of deity, has been preached for centuries. It's nothing new. It's the only way for history books to accept him. After all, how can a man of another religion, or a man of no religion, \\"know\\" Jesus as the Son of God without being Christian? He can't. A historical Jesus is required for Jesus to fit into conversation among those who don't believe in him as a savior. This is why a man of any other faith can ONLY preach a historical Jesus. If the author was able to preach the Biblical Jesus (the Son of God), then the author would be a Christian; he's not, and everything he writes reflects that, including ignoring Jesus' own words on who he was.<br /><br />During a recent tv interview, the author of this book became extremely angry when asked why he, a Muslim, would write a book about Jesus. He listed his impressive set of degrees in a lengthy defense. Whether or not this was a valid question depends on what kind of Jesus you are looking for from this book. If you want a historical Jesus, then the questions about the author's own faith are irrelevant, even insulting. The author is very qualified to write a historical book on world religions and religious figures.<br /><br />However, if you're looking to know the Jesus from the Bible, the Christ, the Savior, then it's important to note that in Jesus' own time there were plenty of highly educated men and scholars, but these were not the people chosen by Jesus to be his followers. In fact, it were the self-proclaimed educated men who rejected him outright. Education is something to be sought after but has never been, and will never will be, a qualifier for truth, and especially not a qualifier for salvation. There are plenty of well educated people on this earth who are wrong about a great many things, and a masters degree burns in fire just as easily as old newspaper.<br /><br />For those who wish to include Jesus in their list of comfortable and fascinating conversation pieces, this book is for you. As for everyone else; those who want to know who Jesus for who he really was and what he had to say; his message of love, forgiveness and grace; read your Bible. He's there.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My daughter is 5 and loved it and I thought it was pretty funny myself.  It's nice that there really wasn't any violence, just some older themes, but nothing really naughty that a younger kid could pick up on.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I saw it on my brothers iPad so when I saw it on my Kindle, I flipped!  So fun! I'd recommend it to everyone.
0307700879|5.0|This is captivating and very unusual book about four different people during War 2, in foreign country.  It it very human story about love and grief of wounded people.  About two thousand people writes their favorites quotes from this book on internet. Buy this book, read it, enjoy it!.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this series and the one that follows it (Shift) and loved them!  I was sad to put them down because I can't find another book as good to read right now.....cannot wait to download Dust when it comes out in August.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I really like Maggie Stiefvater's writing. The first book of hers I read was The Scorpio Races, and after a rough beginning, I fell in love. Then I devoured The Raven Boys, and then I made it back to Shiver. I think I might have checked this out from the library a few years ago and never finished it. Maybe I wasn't in the mood then, but I was now.<br /><br />I read the Q&A with the author, where she said that she was inspired to write the story after reading The Time Traveler's Wife and wanting to move an audience to tears. I think I object to that sentiment the way I object to any forced emotion. That being said, it's a moving story, although somewhat silly if you think about it too hard. However, if you are willing to accept the premise (not just the werewolves, but the love at first sight, which is a harder swallow for me), then this is an enjoyable read. Most of all, I think I came away with a passion to read more of Rilke's poetry (and I'm suddenly picky about who translates it, because when I did a quick online search, the translations I found were nowhere near as poetic and beautiful as Stiefvater's).<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the rest of the trilogy, although I'm not sure where it will go, and I'm not sure this shouldn't be a standalone book. But we'll see how I feel about that after reading Linger and Forever. 3.5 stars.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|I read this for a psychology class, and was hooked from the first few pages.  Plath strings words together so beautifully and her insight was way ahead of her time.  I felt like I understood the illness of depression much better after reading The Bell Jar.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I look so forward to this show, I Love It!!!! Can't wait till next season. It keeps you on the edge of your seat.I hope next season is just as kick a--.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is really fun. you get to buy a horse and take care of it. the goal is to compete until you win the us finals. it is really fun. I like it because it is very detailed. the horses actually look like horses and its not low quality. my horse is really cool. you should get this app. it is really fun to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is fairly difficult.  It is not easy like some games.  I like it because I like challenges.<br />Joel
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this game! it is so much fun! if you love building, creating, and personalizing your life, this is the game for you! it is so much fun! it is EPIC!
B008JF8O9M|2.0|I was not able to get this app to work. Instructions are not helpful . Not very user friendly. word
140006922X|5.0|I feel the need to point out an error that I came across while reading this fine book. Page 179 refers Diaspora Jews as one of the, \\"small minorities living in large metropolitan centers like Antioch and Alexandria\\". Far from being a small minority in Alexandria, Jews may have amounted to over 10% of the population. In a city replete with minority populations, 10% seems rather large to me.
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink sheds light on the art of selling in a very soulful  ...<br />easy to relate to way.  I loved this book  ...
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love the continuing escalation of drama between all the characters and stories happening within the big story.  This is written with such depth and detail. Onward to book three.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Not that great.Till this update it was good.But now it started behaving wierd.its not tracking my locayion,nor it is giving an option to enter a location manually.Hope this will get resolved in next updaye
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I could write a book full of the oddities and inconsistent details in this book, and the next two in the series.  If I could get past the constantly changing characteristics of the supporting &#34;cast&#34; I'd give the story and writing five stars.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Good,but should have more options like,playing from any cloud server and should include playing all kinds of media files in future
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is super fun and makes you think about what actions will benefit your town. It never seems to get old!
B0026PW67W|5.0|This is remarkable. I was impressed by its size and material. It is made out of parchment paper, which makes it look real! This really helps you to know more about Hogwarts School of Witchcraft&Wizardry. Perfect item for Harry Potter fans!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A very addictive game that kept me wanting more levels floors and clues. good graphics and fun clues that kept me entertained
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This has two things going for it that most other series have forgotten to include:  A storyline and character growth.
0061452068|5.0|This book explores a great many if the ideas that seem central to my reasons for doing things.  I can give this book to people that think that I am completely crazy to have my opinions.  After reading it, they will understand me.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|loved this book.lots of &#34;big&#34; words but very compelling.images especially if you are a Christian..makes me happy,happy,happy<br />everyone should read this
1401923127|4.0|In an engaging and approachable style, Lipton explains spirituality and communal connectivity through his complex academic work in cell biology. We have been conditioned to stand alone and compete. It is when we come together and unite our unique gifts that we are capable of pushing humanity forward. As learned from cell colonies, each individual has immense value to add to the whole. We are all divine and must release outdated programming of survival of the fittest, and act in ways that support everyone and everything on this planet.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Definitely a chick flick, but adorable! Has a great cast too with great eye candy as well. Cute humor throughout!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Awesome author and fantastic novels!  I have read all of his books and wish I had more to read.  His books really captivate you.
0812982622|5.0|Just took my breath literally away...Easily the best book I read all year. as i search for 7 more words.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Tom Keifer is back and in full vocal force after all his struggles with his vocal cords, He comes out rocking with Solid Ground, Ain't That a Bitch, reminiscent of his days as frontman for Cinderella, His beautiful ballads, Ask Me Yesterday, and Thick and Thin( dedicated to his wife Savannah) show the true range & beautiful tones of his voice,  This is a must for any music lovers collection. ROCK ON TOM!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I have NEVER seen an app with so many ads.  Every time you &#34;die&#34; you have to click through 3-4 ads or within app purchases screens to get back to game play.  It was so frustrating that both my spouse and I deleted the game within minutes of downloading it.  The game itself was fun, but not worth playing because of the excess ads.
0553801473|3.0|I had a hard time reading this book as I found it dull and boring.  Martin seems to want to keep it a never ending story with contstantly killing off main characters and adding new ones.  If I had to do it over again, I'd have kept my money and waited for HBO's version.
159315724X|5.0|Wonderful book on taking the small steps to make a huge impact in your financial and personal life. I also got the Cd's, which are really great.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|James Franko could not have played a better Oz! This prequel is the best of all time!! The quality of the DVD was of the Highest quality!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book is a continuation of the previous and just doesn't end!  Rather disappointing, but always room for more to follow!
B00AE1P8UM|2.0|Told by a friend that this book was actually where \\"The Secrets\\" book got it's information.  However I found it a bore to read and haven't even got to the end of this one. Found it to be slow process to read.  Everyone is different in what they like but a book that makes one struggle through 4 pages at a time is hardly worth the time.  Did get through half of it. May finish it when nothing else is available on vacation time or something.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I'm not sure who writes this stuff but I'm getting tired of comedies that have 30 min of comedy then put you to sleep with the rest of the move.
0307895505|5.0|This guide is incredible. Extremely informable. Almost too informable with the guide's index but, after some page jumping, you always find what you're looking for. Really like how it explains all options that are available for all quest. And as my 1st purchase from Amazon, I was slighty nervous about delivery. The guide had arrived on the day Amazon had given and in good condition. This was a birthday gift for my wife and she was just as happy, if not more, as I was. I will gladly use Amazon for more purchases in the future.
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|Though a bit predictable the movie was a good overall watch.  Even my wife liked it and she hates everything. :)
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I don't like the new upgrade at all. This was the best weather app until now. Hope this will be changed in the near future.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I love One Direction and this book is awesome. The pictures are really cool. And I totally love how it's an autobiography. It's great and I would totally recommend it to all Directioners. This is one of the greatest books ever! Every single star should have a book that is as awesome and amazing as this one.  <3
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is really fun you can do what ever you want to do on it and as big you what it and how you what it to look
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Maybe my mistake was reading the book first. This movie was so different from the book, it wasn't even funny. Starting out with the color of the main character's hair. Are you kidding? Why couldn't that be the same?<br />I didn't think the main characters had very believable chemistry. Not worthy of having the same title as a Nicholas Sparks book.<br />I was very disappointed.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|it works great=) I bought it for my sister and she loves it... of course it's a disney classic so you can't really go wrong=D
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|unusual yet evocative in extremis. brings back childhood, obvious christianity overtones which can easily be ignored.<br />almost brought on tears...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Did you like. Was it fun. How do you play it.  Is it hard. Is it easy. Do you hate it.
140006922X|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. The statements about Jesus in the book was backed by historical facts and legit references.
B005PK57NU|5.0|There are so few programs on TV today that have good intriguing plots with many story lines AND great actors.
B000VIPJKM|1.0|This film is an insult to the universe. It made me forever doubt the wisdom or virtue of humanity. Watch and despair.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game so cool a must get and have perfect for fans of the first and second movie it is amazingly fun
B00A757EFW|3.0|I loved this game in the 80's and was happy to see a free app that I can play an old familiar game.  However, I do not like how it only lets you get so far before it shuts the game off and tells you to go on you need to pay money,
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is one of those movies see in a theater with a big rum spiked root beer and a bucket of popcorn. Bruce Willis with John Malkovich and HELEN MIRREN, yeah other greats show up too: Morgan Freeman, Richard Dreyfus, and even Dexter's Daddy James Remar. With this kind of cast to keep you company, it doesn't have to be the most original or smart script. It's pure fun.
B004ZY0VHY|3.0|I think I expected it to be more of a recount of a mothers issues with her son.  It is done to a point thru letters to her husband.  I think I would have liked it in a more chapter by chapter format.
B005LAII80|4.0|Fun, action, action and more action. What more do you want? It's better than the Stallone from '95, and I'll take Lena Headey anyway any day.
1451624468|3.0|The general theme of the book is interesting on a scientific level. The writing leaves something to be desired - it's technically chewy and doesn't allow casual readers an immersive experience if you're not familiar with some of the concepts of particle physics and quantum mechanics.<br /><br />Krauss makes many attempts throughout the book to be amusing - he mostly comes off as arrogant. I think it's because he's approaching the whole book from the angle of, &#34;Well I can't technically SAY that creationism is wrong, but I'll do everything I can to behave as if everything science has ever produced is correct.&#34; I am not into the whole empiricism vs. creationism argument (alas, like most things, surely the answer lies somewhere in between the two), so it was rather irritating to see him constantly trying to make his case. Worse yet, he really does believe he's being subtle about it. Poor Lawrence. Social humility is not the strength of many great physicists.<br /><br />And yet, because he is an excellent physicist, great stretches of this book can be very insightful and enjoyable to read. Again, he's not winning any awards for making the content digestible and comprehensible to many readers - but if you have the tenacity (or hell, the natural proclivity) to understand what he's saying, many confusing passages become clearer after a second breeze through.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent read if you're familiar with some scientific concepts in the realms mentioned above. If you are new to this sorta thing, you might not end up finishing the book. Likewise, if you are a super informed individual in the areas of particle physics and quantum mechanics - you're not going to find anything new in this book.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|This adaptation of the Jo Nesbo book feels like spotting a Koenigsegg (hey, we're in Sweden here) in a parking lot, doing the perfect break in and theft and making away with it like you're the Stig. Speed, style, and badass-dom.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|What can't I watch past steams and can you enven watch past live steam and if so that is some bull. And you can't look up peoples channels they have to be steaming
B00006FDCD|5.0|I had to have this. When I get the flu this is the kind of medicine I want on hand to scare the bejeezus out of whatever bug's got me. It's hard to believe it was a network TV movie, it's so well done. Tim Curry is deliciously ghoulish, I almost want Pennywise to live in my closet...
B005UDD1R6|5.0|With the ease on one touch recording, I can get every song from the first note! Playback is just as easy!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I Couldn't put it down.  this book is a great read for a book club. The questions at the end of the book are well done.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i really enjoy this app and good for kids its entertaining and fun for all ages must get app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!my sisters really love it
B008M87GJK|5.0|An excellent app which helps me keep up-to-date with world news.<br />I can choose the stories I want to read i.e. I am particularly interested in news from Africa as well as Science and Technology news so I can choose to see these.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|doesn't work i installed it and it didnt want to work for no reason its a tottl waist of time
1452113432|5.0|Lots of lovely French recipes to try.  Just loved reading about Rachel's culinary exploits in this grand city. If only ... Reading it, one vicariously experiences what it might be like to live in Paris and to embrace the food.  Love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very cool app I can play with my friends<br />Minecraft is  EPIC<br />Have fun with this cool app it's worth it
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It's great have problems getting coins with scratch off not working when time is up. Sometimes I go days before I get another one.
B006ZN7KMM|3.0|tiene varias historias interesante, sin embargo no contenía ninguna que me llamara fuertemente la atención, sin embargo, es muy probable que con una que le guste, valga la pena la descarga.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I fell for this story and fell in love with the characters. What a truly compelling story. Definitely worth reading.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|so this game is so cool my sister plays it is so so so so so so so so cool for my family to play this is the best game ever!!&iexcl;!!''''&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I definitely love the new update. The app now seems fresher to me.  I like how I don't even have to look for the app to open it because it is right at the top of my screen.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Not a bad game at all has great graphics and kind of is a mixture of DOTA and LoL so if your interested in those definitely get it but this app is perfect, sorry to say, but the issues aren't really big. There is a lag from time to time which can get really bad to the point were it closes the game but if you start it back up it disappears so that isn't as bad. But one thing that i would like for the developers to fix is the message that says close your game and update it but you have no may of updating it at all even if you Google it or what ever, you can not find anyway to get the update so basically you can't play anything else but solo which gets annoying but i think its still worth ot due to all of it's great graphics, character selection, and market place, and also the maps they have so far are pretty good.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|This is great for logic lovers.  Really makes you think.  The only thing I'd change is adding a reset button because you can get several numbers on the board before you realize you messed up and sometimes you need to clear the board and start over.  I haven't found a way to do that easily.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got the game to see what it was like. I never thought I would play it more then any of my other games. This is a great game. I am totally addicted to it.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Honestly, I'm not sure why I love this movie. It's funny and I was pretty sad when it ended. It is one of the few movies that I could watch repeatedly.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was so much better then the movie. I honestly feel like Charlie is a role model. Like really. He is so positive even when he has so much negativity in his life.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a great bingo site. I play this all the time on my kindle. The only problem I have is that it occasionally freezes, but that may be because I'm on my kindle. Otherwise I love it... Marie
0385535147|5.0|Bought the used hardcover version. It was in great shape and was a great price! Also, it was a great read.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|A feel good chick flick-ish film that was entertaining but somewhat predictable. I enjoyed it and the acting was well done. The story was well told and kept my interest throughout the entire film.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put it down...my hubby was shocked at how late I would stay up to finish each book. Teaches the reader many things...lol!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Game is really Fun! I would totally get it! If you LOVE Minions this is the Perfect Game! Really Like it!
B005INDT4I|5.0|She is one of my &#34;specials&#34;! Wonderful CD! I play it in my car as well as at home. Have recommended it to several of my friends.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great! We can not wait until the next one with Thanos!<br /><br />We recommend this movie to anyone who loves comics!
140006922X|5.0|People who watch Fox \\"News\\" really should try to pick up a book and read it for once in their useless lives and stop thinking whatever Bill Ailes tells them to think. But then, what does anybody expect from people who were told - and believed - up until the last minute that Mitt Romney was going to win the election?
B007MDB71O|5.0|I was only vaguely familiar with the John Carter book series before seeing John Carter during its theatrical release. I had not read the books when I was growing up (and still haven't at the time of this review). I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the movie and intend to pick up the book: A Princess of Mars, the next chance I get. But, back to the movie...<br /><br />John Carter was an exceptionally well produced and directed action adventure set on the alien planet of Barsoom (Mars). I only later realized that this is THE story that inspired a slew of subsequent knock-offs like Flash Gordon, Superman and the like. It's a really great Sci-Fi / Action Adventure Fantasy movie. In my mind, it's up there with the original Star Wars (A New Hope).<br /><br />Oh, and by the way the visual effects are fully up to the task of supporting the epic vistas and situations that are presented by the story.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I started using YouTube for more than just dog and cat videos. There is a ton of good content on there now--including high quality video podcasts and great comedy shows.  So i've been using their subscription/channels features. Anyway, chromecast lets me watch all of this on my living room tv with brain-dead ease. I already have many ways to get netflix on my TV--but I still prefer using chromecast. It's just so much easier to browse on my phone, find what I want, and cast to my TV.<br /><br />Yeah, tab mirroring still needs some work--but it's not bad on my network.  There is a small lag, but my audio syncs pretty well. I'm glad to know its in beta... hopefully improvements come soon.  For $35, this is definitely a 5 star product.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is  a great value and the size is perfect!  Not too bulky or too tall, just right.  Great Value!
B005544V6A|5.0|Great dialogue and a different twist on the usual legal drama.  The rapport between the leads is fun to watch.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|If Gene Roddenberry had been allowed to develop his vision of Star Trek, it surely would have looked like this. Every episode is filled with exploring brave new worlds, seeking out New life and new civilizations, etc. (you know the rest). It is this series that explains how warp drive works. Not to mention the overarching storyline of a species bent on changing the very fabric of space-time. The Enterprise series is written brilliantly, with believable acting, and never degenerates into a soap opera set in outer space. If you are a Trekkie, and you have never heard of or watched Enterprise, this is the series for you. Highly recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|If course it's a pretty good game!!!! :) I can't stop playing cuz I love it so so much!!!Highly recommend to people who love horses
B005544TRQ|5.0|We love watching this series.  Great fun watching the chemistry between Lewis Litt, Harvey Spector and of course Mike Ross!
159315724X|5.0|Practical, easy read that has great everyday examples!!! I have read several self help books and this is by far the best one I have read to date.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|can't stop playing, love this game (my girl hates how much I love it) graffics so simple its brilliant, love it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is such a joy to see a movie or a series with good dialog. Character development is excellent very amusing and witty. A fascinating look at times long ago.
140006922X|5.0|Garbage biased muslim-hating Fox News interview aside, I love this book. Very different study of the life and times of Jesus as a jew. This book is about Judaism not Christianity btw but either way I'm halfway done and really like it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Adults and kids alike will enjoy this movie.  The script is great, the vocal talent is superb, and the animation is modern, while remaining organic to the story.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I am a new viewer of Downton Abby.  I realty enjoy the programs/series.  Sometimes I want to yell at the actors/characters, which causes a &#34;look&#34; from my wife.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a very entertaining show that always keeps you guessing and surprises you. I just started to watch the series and am looking forward to watching the rest of the shows
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Its a fun game that my kids can play. Some features cost but you can still play without paying.<br />The pony theme is a very cute bonus also.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Putting romantic preferences aside (I'm soooooo team Eric), I thought the book was extremely well written, even though there were still a lot of unanswered questions, especially concerning Mr. C and Sookie. Why I'm not giving it a lot of stars is due the fact that the books leading up to this one showed a weak and whiny Sookie who didn't fight for anything. She wouldn't fight for Eric or anything else. And if it took a lot of thought or effort to solve, she just put it to the back of her mind to think of later or until something exploded or someone died.<br />I knew that as soon as Sam gave her partial ownership in the bar all the big talk she had going would die. What about getting an education? And did she ever once this ENTIRE series think about getting a good contract going with the King of Nevada? She had to have figured out somewhere along the series that the vampires weren't going to just up and leave her alone. And I know that Eric left his \\"wish list\\" but does Harris really expect us to believe that this ruthless vampire society that she's created is just going to up and leave an unclaimed, part-fae telepath alone? OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT! Eric probably wouldn't even be out of LA before the vamps descended!<br />I personally believe that Harris got bored with her SVM Series and was just writing to get books out because her contract said she had to. Then all the sudden, last book comes around and Harris seems to feel like writing again and writes a well written book with the lovable strong and stubborn Sookie. Sookie is suddenly willing to fight for her and Eric and is in love with him...but she's not that torn up that he's leaving? Arg!<br />Written wise? Good Book.<br />Series wise? WTF just happened? Did I really just spend the past 13 years of my life following a telepathic barmaid that goes through dramatic personality changes and sleeps with someone right after someone she loved leaves her to go marry someone else? Yes folks, I believe I just did.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I enjoyed all of the seasons of this series, Although at the end I thought that they tended to focus a little too much on Earth related subjects to avoid the more expensive special effects that they needed for the Pegasus Galaxy. Nevertheless the series had an Interesting ending.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. Most of it was a bit unbelievable but that is what you expect with the stars that they had in it. It's worth seeing.
B000ID37RM|2.0|This film was well done, but I hate sad endings that is why I can not rate this film very high, Not my kind of film,
B0015HOFZI|5.0|VERY EASY TO USE, IT OPERATES JUST AS IT WAS DESCRIBED, THE PRICE WAS RIGHT, WORKS WITH MY SYSTEM PERFECTLY
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I listen to this a lot, especially the first 6 songs.<br /><br />I tried to make myself enjoy their previous albums, just couldn't ever get into them much.  A good friend convinced me to come back for this one and I am sooooo happy I did.<br /><br />Great stuff!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I always enjoy Nicholas Sparks & end up crying my way through his books.  He write a good story, easy to read & light enough to get through one in short time.<br /><br />I have yet to read Safr Haven & The Lucky One  ...Currently reading Key Lime Blues so will get to those reviews at a later date.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I absolutely loved all the characters!<br /><br />ii was funny,, sad, tragic in places, but a fabulous read.  and so well written!
B005K17RU0|3.0|I have a Kindle Fire and the old version of the app worked much better.  I can see where the Kindle Tablet would be better with the newer version of the app.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I absolutely love this game...an old time favorite with a new Jack swing...you must get this game...and challenging my friends will be an ultimate experience.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We never saw the first season so this was a great way to bring us up to speed and convenient to watch without ads!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|look forward until 2014 season. Good Character development.  Love the politeness and civility of the time.  Whole idea of servants interesting.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Brilliant game just brilliant but if you don't like these games puzzles riddles and so probably not the game for you; also even for the master puzzler you must have a great deal of patience though no fault to the game however purley excellent.
B004ZKVEE2|5.0|I fell in love with Hawke in the first book, Slave to Sensation,  already and I loved this book. He and Sienna are perfect for each other and although I had such high expectations, the book did not disappoint.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Enjoy the character development and depth.  The evolution of the characters has been fascinating to watch.<br />I would recommend this series
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Terrific book!  Lynne Olson thoroughly researched  this historical period and makes an entertaining story out of the multitude of facts.  I plan to read more of her books.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|Heard this for free on youtube until it was taken down.  Loved it so much I had to buy it.  Powerful music.  Very good movie (could have been great if they trimmed 20 minutes of action when Supes is fighting the world engine).
1743117094|5.0|I love Kate Morton and this was so good I may re- read it again sometime.  Both the book and the audiobook are awesome.  There are not many books written that would make me want to read them again but this one sure did. Whether you are a fan of Kate Morton or not, this is an excellent book.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|I wish this book continued. I would love to see a sequel- wanted to read more about the neighborhood characters.
030758836X|4.0|I thought  this was pretty good.  I enjoyed it enough to want to read more by this author.  A recommended read.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was way better than I anticipated. The plot really builds you up and surprises you in both character development and storyline
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|My absolute favorite tv show, this show is full of drama, Comedy and suspense. Can not get enough!! Always leaves me wanting to watch more.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I enjoyed it. It's a very fast pace game and I think it was more fun than the previous one.  They should allow you to pick the setting, then it would be more interesting.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I would like to start off by saying that any prospective reader needs to discount most of the one star reviews. I read through them all, and most of them are apparently from reactionary Christians who seem to feel slighted because a practicing Muslim dared to write a book about the times of Jesus.  Most of this book is NOT about Jesus per se. It is about the times in which Jesus lived. The author starts off the book by clearly stating his own personal beliefs and religious history. He clearly states that he is writing about Jesus of Nazareth, that is, what was going on at the time when Jesus was born, lived, and died, and NOT Jesus the Christ, the religious figure. The author encourages the reader to make their own decisions in that regard. Much of what the author discusses in not new material. What makes this a good read is how the material is presented. The author is a graduate of the Creative Writing workshop (University of Iowa, MFA program)  which helps to explain why he is such a good writer. But, he is also is a graduate of Harvard with a Masters of Theological Studies, and a PhD from University of California in the Sociology of Religion. He is well grounded as both a writer and as an academic and it shows in this work. If you are a devout Christian, this work will challenge, indirectly, some of your personal beliefs. It is an interesting read, well written, and provides some interesting insights into the historical period that Jesus lived.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Truth, perception, and reality to each of us is different. We each have the capacity to make truth, perception, and reality better or worse for others.  Make it good.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! There were a few times I thought I had figured out the ending but she would always throw in a twist to make you second guess yourself.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I really liked the product because achievement fulfill all that was needed.<br />Fulfilled with my expectations completely.<br />Would consider buying again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little dongle is pretty amazing, it does it's job and does it's job very well. For those of you out there wondering how worth it it really is with it being so limited you have to understand it's well worth it and won't be limited for so long. This little dongle only requires developers to add a few lines of code to make their apps work with the Chromecast and with such wide adoption by consumers developers will be getting on updating their apps very quickly.<br /><br />Streaming content from an Android and iOS device is very easy, BUT it cannot stream local movies or music! Only music from Google Play Music, and videos from Google Play, Netflix, and YouTube are supported right now. That is only for Android and iOS though. On a computer you can drag any movie stored on your hard drive into the Google Chrome window, Chromecast (or Google Cast) the tab and it will play it. You can even cast your entire desktop though this is still an experimental feature.<br /><br />One of the coolest features of this is with iOS and Android streaming it isn't actually \\"streaming\\" it is actually casting. What happens is the Chromecast will look up your content from YouTube or Netflix (so far) and then play it using its own Wi-Fi network, at this point your device becomes a remote and nothing more, you can use it just like normal. The device won't heat up or lose battery power because it isn't actually streaming the Chromecast is doing all the work.<br /><br />When it comes to mirroring a tab on your computer or mirroring your whole computer desktop it is streaming though, it does have to get the image from your computer so it will wear down the battery on your computer a little faster. It does have a little bit of a lag as well but software updates will soon fix that I'm sure. You can use the tab casting method to watch movies from other services besides just Netflix and YouTube with (almost) no problems. Some sites don't work and the quality may be degraded somewhat but in my testing none of that was really a problem. I don't have Hulu so I didn't test that out.<br /><br />This device is amazing, especially considering there is much more to come, and well worth the $35 price tag. At that price why are you even considering this? Get it now!<br />Don't forget to let me know if my review was helpful!ting none of that was really a problem. I don't have Hulu so I didn't test that out.<br /><br />This device is amazing, especially considering there is much more to come, and well worth the $35 price tag.

B005FMZVLQ|5.0|I really liked the product because achievement fulfill all that was needed.<br />Fulfilled with my expectations completely.<br />Would consider buying again.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|I didn't like TRON: Legacy but I was giving this disc away as a door prize at a museum screening of the original TRON.  So I was happy to purchase the disc at such a good price.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Just in time for John Grisham's sequel to A Time to Kill, I just had to download this classic to my Kindle Fire. And I love it even more!! Have read his early works many times (The Firm, A Time to Kill, Pelican Brief, The Client) in hardback and paperback forms. A Time to Kill is his third book I have on my Kindle Fire (The Racketeer, The Confession) and it makes reading his books all the more easier. A Time to Kill has got to be my favorite of all his legal thrillers. Great writing all around!! Love me some Grisham.
B00005OCMR|5.0|The interviews are especially interesting because some were made in 1983 and others - some of the same people - were made 20 years later.  I had no idea what a technical AND POLITICAL project TRON was and this price was especially nice.
B00C7GY8Y4|4.0|Forgettable tracks, a few that are ok. not a bad buy for 3.99. disappointed considering the hype that the album had...
B008C20TDG|4.0|What i loved about this book the most was that it made me think about food in a whole different way.  It teaches you about the psychology, biology and chemistry  of food and how it interacts with your body!!!  Now every time i crave sugar or a little treat i think about the psychological and biological processes that fuels many peoples addictions to food.  It is an eye opening book everyone should read.<br />  Now on the diet side, this is not something easily done.  To cut out pretty much everything but protein, veggies and fruits is extremely difficult.  I personally suffer from severe sugar cravings and am having a very hard time sticking to the plan but i know several people who have done it and it has really changed their body and health in only a month.  I will continue to stick to it though because of how healthy i would like to become.
B009PNQUXO|3.0|I don't really look at You Tube, just when someone sends me a link to look at something. It's okay
B00CATSONE|1.0|The title makes this book sound like it is about Tesla...only one chapter actually is. It is a weak attempt at a self help book to encourage creativity.<br /> Disappointing. Deleted it.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Once my granddaughter caught on to how to scroll through the letter to choose which one she wanted to play with, it kept her entertained for a long time. The games seem to have the right balance of fun and education and the background beach sound effects were soothing.
B00371XIJE|4.0|Great heartwarming true story about a man and his dog.  It's a dog movie so have tissues ready.  More words.
B007CXQ7IM|5.0|This historical movie was terrific.  While at times it was difficult to watch his struggle, it was definitely worth it!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The entire Outlander series is wonderful! Adventure, relationships, history, and fantasy sprinkled with time travel! Strong female heroin, and incredibly devoted, charming, strong and romantic adventurer, as her mate. Travel the world with Clair and Jamie Frasier. You will not be dissapointed!<br />Drums of Autumn brings the couple from Scotland, across the sea to the Islands, and on to the colonies of North America.<br />This is my second reading of the 7 books of the series, in anticipation of the release of the final book of the series in December.
B0084670FU|5.0|I am surprised that this movie only has a 3 star average rating, when the plot, acting, directing, cinematography, etc., where significantly above average. My rating is 4.5 stars --- definitely a movie worth watching!<br /><br />Note that the film is directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who is the same person that directed Amores Perros. This movie is in the same mold although I liked Amores Perros more.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Not bad. Solid. Needs to be watched twice to get the full effect. Long though. It's like crash on steroids.
B003FHMHPQ|1.0|I read the reviews on this book before purchasing it, saw that they weren't great. The problem seemed to be that this book was the exact same as the first one. I didn't read the first one, and I am still very disappointed. I can relate to most books by this author, but this one I did not relate to at all. I found it kind of wishy washy , a beach read. It went in one ear out the other.
0345501292|5.0|Evident, I recommend it to all the fans. Great insights in the making of the archetypical movies. The book shows remarkable detail.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Great game ...Its fun addicting and interesting.  The deeper you get the more of a strategy game it becomes. Great way to unplug from this world and watch another.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The program has a great contrast of classes.  It has great suspense, love, hate, sadness and happiness.  Best of all,<br />it has some truth in history!  It is addicting we need more!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I watched a lot of  season 1 when the history channel showed the entire first season before the season finale.  I was hooked.  I like buying the streaming season because I travel and can watch it in a hotel room or on a flight.
0553103547|5.0|A friend of mine told me to read this a long time ago. Unfortunately I didn't listen to him, and now I regret that. As a huge fan of the TV series, reading the books really fill in the blanks, as you would expect. Now I understand why this story would become a hit TV show!
074401493X|5.0|This will supplement anyone who was able to get either the survival edition, or the post-pandemic edition. If you didn't and you are into monsters, this would be a pretty nice addition to get, if you're a collector and or a fan is a must. Remember with the plethora of guides in the internet the only way these physical guides stand a chance is in their aesthetic presentation. They offer good content to get through the game, but for those into comics, or into art these collectors edition guides deriving from some of their favorite games are a win win situation. That's how it is for me anyways! The game is great and to platinum the game get the guide.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Being one of the top TV shows on television, I think GOT has lead the pack in how cable television has overtaken the theater experience.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Honestly, every family should watch this tale of choosing right over wrong in a world where wrong is deemed ok.  Its a classic novel turned movie that is heart wrenching and yet heart warming.  It deals with racism and how one man can provide so many with hope and restored faith in humanity.  Enjoy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a fantastic game!!! Very funny and somewhat addictive. Great graphics and I am loving it. I love the minions.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|If you can maje it past the beautiful breathtaking coastal town of Southport, NC....you will find a sweet, yet dramatic romanctic story that only Nicholas Sparks can bring to you. This movie deals with finding love after loss and also trusting one another.  I suggest your comfy PJs...your fav blanket...and your own honey to curl up beside and click play:)
B00873GRU4|4.0|The book held my interest & I enjoyed the authors imagination. Had some interesting twists. Look forward to the next book
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Brandon Sanderson does it again in this sequel to \\"Mistborn.\\" The book is just as entertaining and captivating as the first in this three part series and keeps you immersed in the fantasy world of the Final Empire.  If you loved Mistborn, you'll love The Well of Ascension as well.
140006922X|5.0|Very interesting book. Great author and it looks like he has properly researched before writing the book. He is also a believer so it makes sense. I may not agree 100% but most definitely it is a work with proper research done
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was good however i thought it would be a little bit more drama. It was a nice ending to a love story.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|any fan of car racing should watch this movie...  They don't make movies like this anymore, Steve Mcqueen barely talks in this, but it is still amazing.. Buy it for the car racing alone.<br /><br />A+
B001T6PXFG|5.0|It is always enjoyable to see a classic movie personality like Gregory Peck star in a film that shows how ordinary citizens tried to survive and assist others during those difficult war years.  The priest portrayed in the movie was a hero to many and forgave his arch enemy which isn't easy to do.  I wanted to view  the movie because I read the novel Hide and Seek, based on O'Flaherty's life.  I also just returned from Rome where the movie was shot and St. Peter's Square hasn't changed since WWII.
140006922X|5.0|Don't listen to the media hype -- this book is not written by an author with an agenda, but by one of this era's great religious scholars.  Reza Aslan's intellect is monumental -- but by the end of his book, you'll be the one feeling smart. He sets forth historical facts and analysis in an accessible style, giving the reader a refreshingly un-shellacked look at a figure most of us have unwittingly come to view as a magician, rather than as a man who walked the earth.
0425263908|3.0|For some reason, these books and Fifty Shades of Gray have some real messed up characters.  These books just don't work for me.  The relationships are dysfunctional and it is all about sex/jealous/control.  I will finish the series, but I will borrow from the library.  Not a set I want to own and reread down the road.
B008133MDK|5.0|I have just watched both seasons over the last few days. The 1st season was great and the 2nd season was even better! I can not wait to find out how they resolve the cliffhanger at the end of season 2!
0345525558|3.0|After the first half of this book, I thought it would be one of my new favorite books.  The second half of the book was slow and boring.  I dragged myself to get through the rest of this book.  Disappointed that this book didn't live up to all the 5 star reviews for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Was addicted from the first episode, watch all three seasons in less than a month. Can't wait for season 4 to start!
B00DURILJ2|4.0|Overall a great movie. Matthew does great job with this role. The kids I feel act our their roles well beyond their age. Good storyline. I felt like the ending was to easy to see that is the only reason it didn't get five stars.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I liked it very much, it was fun and although the plot is similar to the other author's books a few surprises are included and worth of 4 stars
B000002KIE|4.0|I really enjoyed the album, but it could be a lot cheaper ._. Nice packaging and its not a bootleg, so thats the goodside.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Second books are usually a disappointment.. But not in this case. I loved it and couldn't put it down. Can't wait for book three..
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|I love this movie. I especially like it in Italian and with English subtitles. This is a movie worth seeing multiple times.
1609611543|5.0|I like the science behind his argument that modern wheat is a new hybrid that is detrimental to one's health.  He takes us through the development of wheat over time and how and why it arrived at today's current type.  Worth the time to read and make up your own mind about the impact wheat may be having on your health.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Nice Amp looks good sounds good Is good I am impressed with the power this tiny amp pushes.<br />buy 1 today.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|How did it take so long for me to hear of these guys? Kind of reminds me of Keane. Amazing!! Wish they had the full album as MP3 download.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|They sound so great. It's like you can reach out and touch the instrument's. I would recommend them to all music lovers.<br />I was a little skeptic at first be that AKG is made in chine now. but I am impressed. they did a hella good job.<br />So let It be said AKG you rock.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008GKEG|5.0|I love it, now that I've finished it I need to start it again and watch it again its so good.
B0030SZ2D4|4.0|I watched this because of the new riddick movie coming out this year and wanted to get the back story. Liked the concept thought it was really entertaining!
B004VSTP4Y|2.0|I'm a huge fun of The Wolfs of Mercy Falls series. I fell in love with Grace, Sam and all of the other characters in the first book Shiver. I loved Linger as well, and when I found the last book at the school library I was more than over joyed. I'm sad to say that I was totally disappointed. The ending seemed hollow, like there was much more needed to it. I honestly didn't enjoy this book as much as I loved the first two. Those two acquired my total attention, had me reading every second I got, and when I finished them I was completely satisfied and pleased with the ending. What i'm wondering is if Maggie just got tried and gave up. The whole thing seemed sloppy and rushed. I'm totally disappointed that this is how their journey ends.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|Django Unchained is not just problematic in terms of its filmmaking, but in regards to its very existence.<br /><br />For starters, Quentin Tarantino has made a pop culture-soaked Hollywood blockbuster about slavery, and he's earned an enormous amount of money by doing so. That seems a bit flippant to me, but the real killer is the film's hackneyed and one-dimensional approach to its subject matter and characters. Tarantino seems content to do nothing more ambitious with his film than preach about the sins of rich, white, slave owners. Considering the type of movie Django Unchained is, this last part strikes me as insincere and perhaps even fraudulent, and it makes the entire film feel like an effort to cash in on people's sympathetic gut reactions. To put it in other words: Quentin Tarantino is a rich white man who has exploited the history of American slavery for millions of dollars in personal profit by pandering to an audience's distaste of rich white men who exploited black slaves for personal gain.<br /><br />Hmm....<br /><br />But let's set aside the film's context for a moment and dig into the content a bit more. The next question is: is this a good film on its own terms?<br /><br />Well, Django Unchained is long. Three hours long. It is reasonably possible for a movie to stay entertaining for that amount of time, but Django Unchained is bloated with long moments spent hammering away on the same trying themes. For example, there are numerous scenes in the movie where a character is shocked to see a black man on a horse. Several discussions are even had about it. Once or twice is enough to get the point across, but revisiting it every few moments over the course of 180 minutes is not just dull, it's insulting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the horse scenes are representative of the entire film. Tarantino has not given his viewers the slightest room to think for themselves or interpret the film on their own terms. Every idea is so bare and free of nuance that a child could understand it, yet Tarantino bludgeons away as though he is introducing a perception of American racial discrimination to the world for the first time. \\"Racism is bad, and all people are equal\\" is the easy message here. This is one of the most disheartening aspects of the film, as the simplicity and heavy-handedness of Tarantino's storytelling is unlikely to change the mind of anyone who isn't already over the fence. Even worse, the film manages to present a main character that contradicts its own message of acceptance.<br /><br />Django is about as one-dimensional as any character I've ever seen in a film. He is not only devoid of personality and charisma, but he fails to offer any personal insights or opinions of his own. Instead, he is driven solely by revenge and, as the film trailer so proudly advertises, a desire to kill white people. Which effectively takes the sincerity of Tarantino's anti-racism message, wads it up, and throws it right out the window. The rest of the cast is similarly flat, and even Christoph Waltz's fine performance cannot save his character from falling into tiresome predictability two minutes after he appears onscreen.<br /><br />It is also worth mentioning the violence in the film. The blood is tinted orange and looks like it is being sprayed from a garden hose. Tarantino's embrace of his reputation as a dark and edgy filmmaker has left the violence without a shred of the subtlety or believability needed to make it effective, which places it in the same disappointing space as every other aspect of the film.<br /><br />Tedious, dull, and in desperate need of an editor, Django Unchained is an atrocious piece of filmmaking that disregards the intelligence of its audience while preaching a message that is not represented by the filmmaker, the story, or the title character.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|When I first started to read this book, I quit reading it for a month and started to read Linger un-aware it was the 2nd of this series. When I finished Linger, I was pretty much hooked. I went back to Shiver and re-read the entire book. I fell in love with all of the characters and thought it was well written. I was on my heels waiting to see what would happen next, I wasn't able to put it down. I think this is a great book, I loved it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Who knew that a series based on quasi british royalty would be so gripping! The shooting, editing, writing, acting and costumes are all brilliant!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Takes up way too much memory! Slow! Had to delete it. I now still have a lot of memory after removing it and I am still adding new games
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I think this is a terrific series. I love the interaction between the family and staff.  If you enjoyed the previous seasons you will enjoy Season 3 as much if not more.  If you haven't yet watched Downton Abbey, I highly recommend it.  Looking forward to Season 4. Thanks Amazon for making this series available.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The plot answered a lot of questions I had about the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and I'm sure there's more to come!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Well thought out story with so many twists.  I was hooked right from the beginning, slows down in the middle with a good ending.  This was my 1st Stephen King book, liked it so mush I'm trying The Stand.  The narrator does a great job with all the different voices, even the foreign  accents.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is my favorite game just needs some updates and commands you should get the game it is worth the 7.00
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I wish our life on earth could be as optimistically innocent as the space exploration the Enterprise is beginning for mankind.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer has a plot that is complex with surprising twists.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who is John Grisham fan.
0385342055|4.0|I've read all of the Shopaholic series.  It's fun, light reading, completely outside the realm of reality.  Sure, sometimes I wanted to smack Becky upside the head, but I still enjoy her antics.  We've seen Becky go from single gal, to living in New York, to marrying her perfect mate, getting pregnant, and now, with her toddler.  I think Kinsella has probably come to the end of the series.  Shopaholic is the epitome of the Chick Lit genre.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The Misremembered Man was a book that touches the human soul. It has humor, sadness and the horrors of  what happened to children in the Catholic orphanages in Ireland. I also reveals what true friendships are. A good read.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Was not as challenging or fun as some of the other escape game.  A couple of the levels were pretty boring.
B000025Y9I|5.0|I liked the energy of the music in both instrumentation and clarity of the vocals, the ideology of the lyrics and the voices of both the lead singer and backup singers.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Easy fun way to pass the time.  Not too hard until you get into the timed sections.  So we just did the diamond section and will probably not tackle the timed sections.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it and can't stop playing. I wish I had more time to play it. I'm glad the game doesn't require  Wi-Fi.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I just have no words for the eye opening acts that women to do bring themselves down, as well as the ways that we can avoid perpetuating stereotypes. Brilliant book, especially for those of us young women joining the corporate world.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Ground breaking book presenting a new vision of the cosmos and the human being. Excellent reading for open minds. Another wow book by Tolle
B008Y729FU|3.0|The crow is a very dark movie about how two young lovers were killed in their apartment by a gang of street thugs who work for a drug dealer. Brandon Lee gives a good performance as The Crow who comes for revenge and kills the gang but the plot has been done many times before. It’s worth a watch on prime instant video.
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|Now IF you like REAL country music, and not some of the \\"stuff\\" that is attempting to passed as such, then YOU NEED this new project by Vince Gill and Paul Franklin!!-<br /><br />This is the ABSOLUTE REAL DEAL!! So good, it made me have chills and muscle twitches when I first heard it! A MUST have for any true country music aficionado!
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Disc World-ish.  I enjoyed this book very much, and I consider myself an eclectic, adult reader. The other books, supposedly related, didn't look to be written on the same level, and I did not go on to try them.
0345803485|5.0|I didn't want to read this book because after hearing about it, it was not my cup of tea, but finally got talked into reading it and I could not put it down.  Ignoring all the mistakes and getting into the story, it's a beautiful story.  I have read it, re-read it and still can't put it down.  It's just such a beautiful love story.  How they both change for each other and how much they are willing to do to make the other person happy....The book has everything, from romance, mystery, sadness, love, family, etc etc etc.  For those who are thinking of reading it, by pass the mistakes and get into the love story and you will love it, I know I did and now can't wait for the Movie, hope is as good as the books.  I hope there is a book in the future with more of their life together, them getting old, etc.
B007FIY3VW|2.0|This product seems to offer a few templates, but not enough functionality for my needs.  I'm not sure if I'll keep it.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I have never read a James Rollins book I didn't enjoy and this one is no exception. If you're a fan of Rollins, Clancy, Coonts, or Cussler you'll enjoy this book as well.

B003JH8LPW|4.0|Dan Browns Digital fortress in my opinion and let's be honest that is all a review is was a very nice read. For those that have no IT expertise some of the story may not be completely clear and some of the terminology will not be familiar but then Digital Fortress is like any other book that you read in which its subject matter is not your expertise you will learn some things and be exposed to things that are new. I found Digital Fortress to be enjoyable and I am in the IT field. I did not mind at all that some of the premise was far fetched it is why it is called Fiction. I enjoyed the fact that Digital Fortress did not get caught up in too much detail or get off on tangents that is common to some of these stories. Digital Fortress to me was pretty straight forward with only minor story lines that added to but did not take away from the primary story line. I find it unfortunate that others chose to give Digital Fortress low marks for the computer exactness, again being in the IT field it would be very difficult if not terribly boring to be exact and at least for myself I was not reading it to be a how to manual I wanted to enjoy some fiction and I did enjoy ready Digital Fortress as Fiction. I could tell the same person wrote Digital Fortress as the one that wrote Davinci Code and Angels & Demons and other books by Dan Brown that I have also read. So maybe those folks that gave the book a low rating have not read Dan Browns other Fiction novels, I believe this to be just as interesting as many of the others. And it would not surprise me to see Digital Fortress as a movie, it certainly could not do any worse than some other book to movies that have been made.<br />So my parting comments is read the book for yourself and simply enjoy a good Fictional story about a pretty far fetched and crazy idea about our country's own Digital Fortress.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is the best I have played. It's beautiful and comforting yet very challenging.  I have all 3 versions and this is my favorite.
B005CRY2O6|3.0|Honestly, I just don't quite get all the hype about this book. It is beautifully written and photographed, but so far I am underwhelmed by the recipes. After trying 4 or 5, there is only one I would make again. Use of olive oil and yogurt are pretty heavy-handed and seem like an attempt to sub for missing meat, but also end up covering up some of the fresh flavors. I have to say... I just don't get it. I will try a few more, then this goes in the give-away box.

B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|I just watched the movie for the first time and I didn't expect it to even come close to be good by watching a no good movie trailer. Actors playing actors were good and special effects were average, but good average. Many of today's B-movies wouldn't have these good graphics or costumes or creature and planet effects. I thought the movie would be bad and the first alien species we meet look silly and quite stupid and I was thinking the movie wouldn't come close to be any good. I was wrong. While the plot is in no way realistical, the movie met my goal and it is to be entertained. It was also funny at times. I liked it. Despite it been a sort of childish movie, mainly because of the plot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is funny when the minions get thrown or hit while running. It's funny when your outside and the running  minion hits a car and slams on your screen.

B002NZV68U|4.0|My 13 year old nephew<br /> loves this movie.  I wish there were more movies that teaches greed is bad and being giving is good.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|Not high budget, but good quality.  The worst aspect is occasionally bad make-up on the vamps.  However, it's full of good acting, action, thrills, suspense, combat, somewhat of an epic.  Technically the sequel to Mulberry St. (not as good a movie but sets the back story for the main character).  Hero was a nice, common guy that grew into hero-hood.  It's gritty, believable (i.e. can be engaged with the movie and not be reminded its a movie because its bad).  Overall, I've watched it about five times already.  Shows the lows and highs of humans character.
0525425772|1.0|I think that most adults can recognize that this is a children's book. The story line is okay, though somewhat sappy. But there is one glaring problem with the writing that really bothers me. In the story, there are references to adults smoking pipes, and portraying it as some sort of idyllic situation. Children's television programming isn't allowed to include that sort of thing. And I don't think that children's books should, either, especially when they are portraying modern life in this day and age, when everyone knows that smoking (regardless of whether it is cigarettes, or pipes) is harmful. And to portray adults as smoking around children as though it is a casual thing is not okay.<br /><br />But the reason that it is included is that it seems to me that John Grisham is trying to use his own childhood memories as a basis in a modern book. He's an old guy, trying to write modern stories based on old experiences. And it just creates a hodge-podge of conflict, because you can't just dumb down past history and throw things like cell phones and computers into it to modernize it. I would expect better of him than to make such a major blunder in writing, since he is so meticulous about the details of his adult novels. To make that sort of mistake in writing a children's book is like he isn't really being as careful in writing for children as he is for writing for adults. And that has me concerned, because as a big name author, he should be held to a higher standard than the run-of-the-mill children's authors, because people are going to buy his books just because his name is attached to it. By doing such a sloppy job of writing a children's book, he's shown that he doesn't really have children's best interests at heart; he is only trying to make a quick buck with an easy book. And that disappoints me very much.<br /><br />I think that parents need to be aware that smoking is portrayed as some sort of idyllic activity in this book, without any hints or references to its potential harm. And I think that sends a wrong message to kids.its potential harm. And I think that sends a wrong message to kids.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Was very excited about this unit when I purchased it. Couldn't wait for it to arrive in my mail box.<br /><br />Positives:<br />Very easy to set up - 5 stars<br />Netflix and youtube runs perfect from my android phone/macbook - 5 star<br />Free 3 months of Netflix - 5 star<br />Better than Apple TV if you have an Android phone<br /><br />Neutral:<br />Only Netflix, Google Play and Youtube are supported right now. Hopefully support for other apps will show up soon.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Laptop mirroring was terrible. The mirrored screen from my MBA on my TV was extremely poor in quality, pretty much un-readable.<br />The mirroring was also very slow. There's about a 1-2 second lag time from what you see on the laptop to what you see on your TV screen.<br />I was mostl excited about the mirroring feature on my Chromecast. But I was extremely disappointed in the results.<br /><br />Overall, disappointing mirroring performance. However, it's still well worth the $35 price tag, especially with the 3 month Netflix deal.<br />I will be buying more of these as Christmas presents for friends and Family.

B0053JJLLC|4.0|Michael Crichton has always been one of my favorite authors. He has written awesome books like [[ASIN:0345468260 Timeline]], [[ASIN:0061703087 Prey]], [[ASIN:B0057DCQMK Pirate Latitudes: A Novel]], and [[ASIN:0061706493 The Great Train Robbery]] as well as some classics such as [[ASIN:0345538986 Jurassic Park: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:006170315X The Andromeda Strain]] (just to name a few).<br /><br />This book, Micro, is Crichton's final novel (published postmortem). Its purpose is to get the reader to see the world anew. With our lives becoming so heavy in technology and climate-control, it's refreshing to remember what it feels like to get lost in nature.<br /><br />Although this book brings reminiscence of [[ASIN:B00DMF8PCK Honey, I Shrunk The Kids]], it's an action-packed and interesting read. It's not Crichton's best book, but it's still well-worth picking up.<br /><br />If it is your first Crichton book and it's not really what you're looking for, I'd highly suggest any of his others.

1476727910|5.0|Matt Haig's THE HUMANS is a deceptively complex work that can be seen through different lenses. On the surface, it's a science fiction tale of an alien replacing a human sent to destroy all traces of a potentially universe destroying discovery. By \\"destroy traces\\" read \\"kill everyone who knows about it.\\"<br /><br />The book's early chapters effectively and satirically expose the foibles of human beings, from wearing clothes, reading magazines, and a preoccupation with fornication. We are seen as only slightly more intelligent than dogs, and are not even the most complex intellect on the planet. Professor Andrew Martin (late deceased, recently replaced by alien) is mystified as to why dead cow is referred to as \\"beef\\" when it obviously refers to \\"cow.\\" He's mystified about everything. \\"Cow\\" is the least of his troubles and confusion. Try understanding a 16 year old adolescent who happens to be your son. That's hard enough for us \\"real\\" humans who have had to traverse that experience.<br /><br />This book reminded me a lot of one of my favorite movies, [[ASIN:B001AQMBNC Starman]]. In that film we observe the alien, Jeff Bridges, from the third person. In Mr. Haig's THE HUMANS, we are living inside the head of the befuddled alien appearing human.<br /><br />As the plot progresses, our protagonist slowly realizes what it truly means to be mortal and human. Wine, peanut butter, dogs, and the poetry of Emily Dickinson all play a role. However, his estranged family (son and wife) become the growing center of a new feeling, love. Above all, true love. Love is discovered, love is earned, love is lost. In the end, there is always hope.<br /><br />Some readers will definitely find this a maudlin read. This reader found a wonderful and bitter sweet tale of longing, love, and too-late discovery, and wiped away a tear at the end.<br /><br />A great book and a great read. Well done, Mr. Haig.
B009IH0ICG|4.0|This is the smaller size chimney offered by Weber and I think it's the perfect size. I can't see needing more coals than this for the 22&#34; Weber grill. My only issue is that the handle gets a little warm. I can still pick it up and dump the coals, but I have to put it down right away. Not really a problem though.
B000LW7OWE|5.0|great way to learn a little about the doors if you have never heard of them although some stuff is a tad bit exaggerated its still a great movie!

B008DW6VOQ|3.0|While I understand it is a 'free' app, I still would expect just a little more from Bloomberg.<br />- It is unstable<br />- I would like for it to be able to handle 'my portfolio' with at least basic features (when I buy, when I sell, profit, loss, etc). Just basic ones.. but not 'that' basic.<br />- Adds get in the middle and in the way to much!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a cliff-hanger! I am in love with all the characters, the house, gentry living, fashions, etc. The plots continue to evolve from week-to-week but also introduce new ones with new characters each episode.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold Fry is retired and very settled at home with his emotionally distant wife whose only concern is their grown son, a son Harold could never seem to love. So he's very much alone, until the morning when the post delivers a brief letter from Queenie, a colleague from long ago. Because she has a cancer that has progressed beyond any hope of treatment, she simply is writing to say good-bye.<br /><br />Remembering what a good, decent woman she is, Harold is stunned by this news and struggles to write some kind of reply. Somehow he feels that he must do something more for Queenie. And without forethought or planning he decides to go to her, by walking more than 500 mile to the nursing home. His journey is one of discovery about the goodness of some strangers, the selfishness of others, the plants along the roadside, the land about him...observing, yet never judging. It's a brilliantly faceted story, unlike any I've ever read before.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Great movie for Sci Fi fans, good special effects and great story line. Must see for sure, I would love to see it again in the big screen.  Will be buying the DVD for sure.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The beginning wasn't all that but towards the middle the book got more interesting. I would recommend this book to all teens
0783232039|5.0|This movie taught me what true love means. I'm sure Chucky has had several women in his time but, as they say in Jerry Maguire, your true love should complete you. You should be like two shards of a crystal, perhaps a dark crystal, that are the same and wouldn't be whole without the other. Chucky and Tiff slay together, so they stay together!<br /><br />On a more serious note though, I love this movie. It has just the right blend of comedy and horror. Although it is never actually scary, it's very entertaining. Jennifer Tilly is hot and is the perfect campanion for Chuck. Brad Dourif also rocks. I also love the plot and twist ending. This series jumped the shark after this one but hopefully Curse of Chucky redeems it.

B00005JLIU|5.0|I saw this movie when I was much younger and I think my memory of the movie was better than the actual movie.<br />It was silly and predictable but sometimes a nobrainer is just what I need.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is such a great movie and has quickly become one of my all-time favorites! The film is nothing like the books, and while that may be a turn off for some viewers, I think it fits well. The books contain such a vast array of old-fashioned adventures that the film feels like just another off-shoot of these adventures. While it shares some similarities with \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" the film also draws in aspects of following books, such as the therns, as an introduction and composite of the Edgar Rice Burrows John Carter universe. I would have liked to see a little more from Taylor Kitsch's John Carter, but after reading the books, some of the stiffness in his acting is from the formality of his character in the books. Lynn Collins was fantastic as Dejah Thoris! What girl wouldn't want to be smart, skilled, and beautiful? She is my favorite character in the film by far. For those who hesitate to see this film, please give it a try! Remember that the books were written by the same man who wrote the Tarzan series, so the feel of the movie is going to be somewhat unrealistic and grandiose in its concept of adventure. Yes, we know there is nothing like this on Mars in reality, but don't let that stop you from appreciating a sci-fi movie that is the product of what started all other successful sci-fi franchises.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This story dragged on and on.  Great acting but honestly I began to hate it more and more as it went.<br /><br />Also it seemed to have an anti God humanistic type of message that was both subtle and very light and strong and bold.<br /><br />I do not appreciate the brain washing attempts to change my beliefs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so amazing I cant stop playing it.<br />In my words it is better than temple run and much more entertaining. Get this game and you will love it
B000NTPDSW|1.0|Warning - If your DVD player was manufactured before these discs were produced then it is probable that you will need a firmware and/or software upgrade to your DVD player to utilize all the features of this product.  This cautionary statement is printed just inside the front cover of the case containing the disks.  I wish I had known this before ordering.  It all sounded so good with so many 5 star reviews that I just plunged in and bought it.  Fortunately I was able to return the DVDs for a refund.  I give Amazon 5 stars for that.<br /><br />I will either have to upgrade my DVD player (not likely) or purchase a different version of these great movies.  Incidentally, the DVDs did play but the quality was nothing to brag about.  Maybe that's only because I need to upgrade.  I'll never know.  The problem with the DVDs was that some menu functions were inaccessible or non-working and some functions operated from buttons on the remote labeled for an entirely different function.  At one point the DVD player froze up and only by unplugging it from the power outlet was I able to turn it off.  So buyer beware.

140006922X|5.0|Jesus was obviously political - he was turned in by the priests after he turned over their money changers table, which was a form of double taxation.  For example, sheep herders would sell their sheep for Roman coin and pay Roman taxes, but to buy anything at the Bazaar they would have to convert the Roman coin to Jewish coin, and pay a Jewish tax for that.  After that event, the Rabbis went to their flocks and pushed for them to allow Barabbas to be released instead of Jesus for Crucifixion.<br /><br />He was a great man, and this book supports that.

B005KWL2IW|5.0|For those of you who read the title of this review and thought of an adult film star, I apologize for the confusion.<br /><br />For the rest of you... Look, I've been a fan of Anthrax since... Um... Well, let's just say that I was around when Joey was with the band the first time. I liked the sound of Anthrax then, but I'm one of the ones who really thought that John Bush changed the band for the better. Hey, it happens... Look at the whole Roth/Hagar debate for that &#34;other&#34; band... I just thought that Bush brought more to the party, and had a darker, earthier, metal-ier voice than Joey did. Not hating on the guy, but I thought that sending him to the showers was a good move.<br /><br />Several years and great (if underappreciated) albums later, John left and after a convoluted mess, Joey was back behind the mic.<br /><br />And my Lord, Joey sounds GREAT. I don't know what he did in the intervening years, but he sounds EXACTLY like how I think Anthrax should sound. The songs are vibrant, the drumming from Charlie Benante... He's an ace - no two ways about it, but he beats those things like they stole his money and winked at his girlfriend. Scotty, Frank and Rob round out the sound in true epic fashion.<br /><br />This album put the band back on the map, and if they can keep the ball rolling (like they did with &#34;Anthems.&#34; Go buy that one NOW!), they'll remind people that there are FOUR major bands in American Thrash.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing device. Amazing value. I love how it pulls the stream from Google Play or YouTube on its own, leaving your tablet and phone free to do other tasks while still acting as a remote.<br /><br />I work for a phone company which has been heavily involved in OTT video. I used the Roku boxes, Boxee, the Western Digital devices and this little device already exceeds them all and has tremendous potential as Google polishes up this devices capabilities.

030758836X|1.0|I picked it up for a quick summer read. The beginning was slow and badly written, the writing was better in the middle, a page turner, yes, in a sick way.  In the last 100 pages the author had so many satisfying choices for her ending and she could still set up a sequel.  Read it if you like to feel briefly horrible, but it is not substantial. It's an easily forgettable book. An airplane book.  A book to get from the library or used. Mine will be a used copy at the Good-will today.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The only downfall is having to wait until the next book is released.  I could not put the book down and read it every minute I had free.  Awesome easy reading!

B0001YRVN4|5.0|I love the movies and these were 4 DVDs in one set, in good shape at a reasonable price! I did not care for the prequels Star Wars 1, 2 & 3.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|In this game, you are given a ball and a very simple objective. MAKE THIS BALL LOOK LIKE THE BALL IN THE PICTURE. While that concept doesn't get any deeper, the methods in which you have to use to make your ball match the reference image gets progressively more and more complex with each level.<br /><br />For example, if you need the ball to be Red on the top half and Blue on the bottom half, you would paint the entire ball red, then cover the top half, and then paint the exposed part of the ball blue. Remove the cover and PRESTO! Your ball matches the reference image and the level is complete. The objects used to cover the portions of the ball are often cute and easy to understand. At roughly 14 levels in, I've used a hardhat, large and small glasses, headphones, and plungers to make some pretty intricate designs.<br /><br />This game is a blast to play, and the difficulty curve slopes up at the perfect rate. Not only will you enjoy playing it, but you'll feel a nice sense of accomplishment with each level you successfully complete.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|The movie really wraps you into the action with the action scenes.  It is well acted and has a fitting ending.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|I own about 500 CDs. From grunge, to metal, to classic rock, I have something for almost every genre/sub-genre revolving around rock/metal. Ghost's first album, \\"Opus Eponymous\\", is easily in my top 15, if not top 10 albums that I own.<br /><br /> I bought this CD on a whim at my local record store one day, after hearing rave reviews online and hearing that they sounded like Blue Oyster Cult (one of my favorite classic rock bands), and on the way to the next store I popped it in the car's stereo and just took it in. At first, the overly satanic lyrics were somewhat shocking, but the music was amazing! Melodic, great choruses, clean vocals, extremely catchy songs and riffs, and yes, the nearly cliche saying at this point is true, Ghost sounds a hell of a lot like Blue Oyster Cult. The album has something that not many albums have these days: atmosphere. It feels heavy and gloomy, even a bit creepy. The album opens with a short, gothic organ piece, that sets the tone for the album, and ends with a fast paced, galloping instrumental, that I can only describe with one word: Epic.<br /><br />As a word of caution, if you're a devout Catholic, you're not going to like this album at all. All of the songs somehow revolve around Satan, and are basically overly satanic. But to be completely honest with you, they become quite cheesy and tacky after a few listens. If you can get over some corny Satan lyrics, (I know I can), to appreciate some damn fine modern music, then you'll appreciate this album for how awesome it really is. If you can't, too bad for you then I guess.<br /><br />The standout tracks to me are Ritual (Which has two amazing guitar solos, with the guitar solo near the end of the song being one of my all time favorites, this is coming from a guitar player of eight years as well), Stand By Him, and Genesis. The whole album is top notch though, with stellar song writing displayed in every song.<br /><br />If you're a fan of rock music, and can get over some corny satanic lyrics, you'll really appreciate and enjoy this album. To be honest with you, I don't think the members of Ghost are satanic at all. It's a gimmick, cause Satan sells, which is quite obvious with the success of their two albums. I highly recommend this album, and I've listened to it in it's entirety at least ten times. It's a fairly short album, clocking in somewhere around 34 minutes, I forget exactly. I also recommend Ghost's second album, \\"Infestissumam\\". It's not as good as \\"Opus\\", but it's still an excellent album.<br /><br />Enjoy and keep on rockin! \m/atanic lyrics, you'll really appreciate and enjoy this album.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|You feel betrayed when you buy the 4 part set only to find out it just keeps going, and going and going.  George Martin is just stretching his yarn into however long he can continue to get paid, and has lost all sense of an author's integrity.  He has characters walking in circles, and you feel the same.  Hey, I've been reading an hour, and have made no progress!!!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Nice movie to watch on a flight. Good action and actors. Well worth the cost. May watch again just for kicks.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|I like this game. I can't always find all the letters. But still quiet fun. I like all the games in this series.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|The effects are good, for the most part, with some genuine gory scenes.<br /><br />All of the major issues are plot-based.<br /><br />It starts with a weird flashback teaser that sets up the main premise of the story, which was basically stolen from every &#34;demon-possession&#34; film, ever.<br /><br />Some of the original story remains...kids at a cabin, they find a strange book in the cellar, an idiot reads the words off a page that has scribbles on it, telling him NOT to read the words...panicked girl gets assaulted by trees in the woods, then the kids start getting possessed, one by one.<br /><br />The problem is, they made the whole thing a basic satanic possession story; taking away all of the Lovecraftian and weird elements of the original. The great thing about that film was that there was no discernible reason for the things that were happening...no real way to stop it, and no idea how to reason with whatever was causing it.<br /><br />This also left the film makers with the option to go completely crazy with the story, without having to explain very much about what was happening or why.<br /><br />When they added this satanic plot element to the whole thing, they opened up so many plot holes in the story that it ends up looking like a bloody piece of swiss cheese.  The ending seemed so nonsensical and wedged in at the last minute, all I kept thinking was that its only purpose was as an excuse for one more gory kill.<br /><br />If you do end up watching this, make sure to keep watching 'till the end of the credits, so you can see the single most disappointing cameo in horror fiction...one that makes you wonder out loud, &#34;Where were you when this thing was being MADE, man??&#34;
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Best puzzle app I've seen so far. Has a lot of puzzles and is moderately difficult, however there aren't many different types and they are used repeatedly with different difficulty levels. I give it a 5 because it is interesting and it kept me entertained for two days. I would love to play the next one when it comes out.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|I just watched it and it is probably too late to return it especially since I tossed the wrapping. At on point the DVD starts freezing then after a few scenes it stops completely. I have to manually skip a scene then it starts up again. Disappointed!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really like this game. Solve the mystery of missing persons in an eerie Vermont town.  Excellent graphics. Find hints and solve puzzles. I am still working on the free portion of the game, but will certainly pay to unlock the paid portions.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I have watched it numerous times since getting the DVD. No problems
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I purchased this game and my  kids love the game so you should get this game because it is fun
B000QGAU4E|4.0|I've wanted to watch this movie for a few years, and I finally got the chance a few months ago. I recently saw V for Vendetta, too. Both movies live in worlds ruled by totalitarian regimes; however, where V is at times comical, Children of Men is eerily in tune with our times, making it a scarier place to visit because one can see what the absence of hope can do to people.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game makes you think. I enjoyed how you have to find hidden objects and put them together in order to get out of the room.
B00005MP58|5.0|This was a very fine adaptation of the novel at a very good price.  Highly recommended for Jane Austin and Colin Firth fans.
B00ABXA1HI|2.0|I thought this would work on my home network, and it does if you buy a monthly subscription, which also allows use on other networks.  However, I am not into the monthly subscription business, and I don't need that capability anyway.  Actually, I never<br />completed the installation, so the rating really is meaningless.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|Recommended for someone who likes classic story telling.  Quick read with what is considered now stilted language.  From time to time I like that kind of read.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Read it before you condemn it.I saw the author on Comedy Central,not Fox.<br />I read all I can about mythology,this is a good for an open minded person.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Great movie, good for the kids and the adults. Worth the money and not too scary that the kids need to worry.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really like this game. I hate to admit I had to use cheats on a couple of levels. Can't wait for more levels.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I really like it has a lot to do and its never boring like other doc. apps. Really fun you should totally get it!
B00138CYD4|4.0|Mainly I bought this for the Alex Band collaboration Why Don't You And I but I found myself listening to the other songs on the album I didn't know. That rarely happens with me.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Since I am a conservative Lutheran I have difficulty with any book that doesn't quite match up with the Word of God as I understand it, especially if that book is speaking as if it is &#34;the truth&#34;. It is well written but is too quick to try and convince the reader that Doctor Alexander's experience of &#34;Om&#34;, is a true experience of God.  Since I do not rely on anyone's experience of God to define Him, I find Doctor Alexander's experience untrustworthy.  I believe that if anyone wants to understand the miracle of faith and the author of that experience, let him read the inspired word, the Bible.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Gave me a better understanding of the cultural adaptations that need to be made by Indian immigrants to the U.S., and what adoptees go through in their search for an identity.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|An interesting situation given an average and uninspired  treatment. Children killing children and destroying families and communities is serious and needs more in depth treatment than this.
B0079LJZG8|5.0|There isn't a single bad actor in this movie. Brilliant acting all around. .Plot is a little complex, but I was able to follow it.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|The mible app does not syce any linked CC rewards.<br /><br />I just accidently/actually paid for an item (no option to use my $500+ in AMEX rewards... I got \\"free\\" $$ but I can't use it on this Amazon mobile app)<br /><br />This app is a 'B-' for sure... a solid 'A-' on browsing, but ordering via the app brings down the apps score in my book.<br /><br />I'll still keep it and use the mobile app for shopping and browsing... and adding items to my wish list/cart.<br />But for now, I will only complete purchases & orders on the full Amazon website (on my desktop PC).
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|PLEASE take off the running notifcation process that actively runs EVEN when the game is completely shut down. And yes, i have notifications turned OFF.
B00COH0W00|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Was romantic, funny, and sweet. John was and still is cute and Kate is adorable in this.  I had watched this when it first came out and wanted to see it again. Im glad i did!
0547884591|5.0|This book has challenged and inspired me to learn more and live the &#34;good life.&#34; Very well written and super engaging.<br />Oh yeah, my wife loves that I am learning how to cook
B002VPEAM6|5.0|Great read and actually funnier than the movie.  I enjoyed the book so much that I ordered another<br />by the same author.  Paul Torday has not disappointed and I recommend anything he has written.
B008OOYALE|4.0|The colors n creativity for this game is great and the boys I watch love it! They hatch New dragons help them grow and there  is no violence in any part of it. I wish the gold was easier to earn but it's still fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was challenging and fun with a little scare behind it. The sometimes eerie, dark and creepy sound effects along with the awesome graphics and puzzle challenges, leave you wanting more. Can't wait for more to come...
B00DRDVHA4|4.0|I finally feel that I've listened to 3.0 enough to feel comfortable giving it a rating.  This is definitely a good album, but just not worthy of the full 5-stars.  I personally feel that anything less than 4 stars is being overly critical.  I'll start off by saying that every other track is better than the opening single of VIVIR MI VIDA.  I've gotten to the point where I actually dislike it, and just skip both versions entirely.  The first song that I listened to was LA COPA ROTA, since it's a classic done by one of my other favorites (Jose Feliciano).  I was immediately let down, because I was expecting a great version, and all I got was a mediocre version.  After hearing Marc discuss how it all came together, and how it was recorded, I think it explains it.  It apparently was an afterthought, just thrown together on the fly, and left like that.  VOLVER A COMENZAR is a totally solid song that has nothing wrong, really.  FLOR PALIDA was immediately my favorite because of the melody and chorus.  It's Marc at his absolute best, until just after the 3:00 minute mark, where they start with the group of background singers saying, \\"pa' que nunca se vallas.\\"  That takes away from the song, but up to that point, absolutely the best.  CAMBIO DE PIEL, ESPERA, DIME SI NO ES VERDAD, HIPOCRESIA, and CAUTIVO DE ESTE AMOR are all solid songs.  I don't like the \\"tickle\\" lyric in DIME SI NO ES VERDAD, and the feathering of his voice in CAUTIVO DE ESTE AMOR, but those are just personal things.  If you are a fan of Marc and salsa, you need to get this album because it's definitely good.  If you are just getting turned on to Marc, PLEASE make sure and check out his first 3 albums (Otra Nota, Todo A Su Tiempo, and Contra La Corriente).  Those 3 consecutive albums are what made Marc the superstar that he is today.  In my opinion he is the absolute best salsa singer ever, hands down, bar none.  Especially doing salsa, his voice is a force of nature that can't be ignored.<br /><br />Whenyou are a fan, expectations are really high with a new album release.  These high expectations make people overly harsh when reviewing new material, especially when they haven't had time to properly digest/process the new material.  I feel comfortable and confident giving it a 4-star rating.
B002OF5KWM|5.0|Provided great insight into the world of club kids that flourished during the nineties. Culkin gave a great performance as Michael Alig. Overall a very good movie!
140006922X|1.0|This book is horrible in the sense that it discounts the sovereign God. What is written may have  some historical value but again it dismisses in a greater sense,  the purpose, the miracles, and the ability of the ultimate creator to direct the path of mankind whether by a group of people or the written word of God. The muslim community through out history has always downplayed \\"Jesus\\" . According to their beliefs, he was just another  prophet , secondary to Mohammed.  This book wants us to believe and trust in \\"nothing\\". The foundation of the christian faith ,is rooted in love, hope, and the belief of a new life. If you really read the teachings of Jesus , according to the Holy word, this is what he expressed.  I  was totally disappointed in this book. Apparently, this is another attempt to discredit the so called \\"Jewish\\" God or Jewish Jesus!<br />Credentials are earth bound and dictated by our limited understandings of a universe endowed and created by greater power. There is a quote that states, \\" when God chose Israel,  so did Satan\\"
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Go Girl Power !<br />Yes it is all fantasy - I think the story is well written and the blur between reality and fantasy is brilliant.<br />The reality story is way too heavy to watch without the altered reality to get us, (and Baby Doll) thru it.<br />This could give girls going thru a hellish time in their lives a way (a reason, a blueprint, an inspiration) to push thru, and keep going.<br />I don't understand the harsh reviews - maybe they were expecting something it is not and never will be.<br />I watched not expecting anything more than to be entertained by hot chicks blowin $#!+ up - and got so much more.<br />Enjoy it for what it is :)
B002W7J3SO|4.0|Again, another terrific film with great music that can't be fully enjoyed because of lousy sound quality on Amazon. Golly. Why can't Amazon do something about this. The Pink Panther and Romeo and Juliette was even worse.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an awesome game especially for people who like horses &hellip;or even people that just like taking care of animals
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a terrific series with a surprise in every episode.  We can't wait until Season 2 is available streaming.

B004I744AS|3.0|I just downloaded this and have not hard the opportunity to use it yet.  I will let you know after I use it.
B00BB22GQM|4.0|I am somewhat long in the tooth at 57 years old, and, after a long life in which music has played an integral part, I suspect that I have acquired better, if not good, taste in music. And I was attracted to VW from the get go. I know of nothing quite like them. In their uniqueness, they are a modern equivalent to the Talking Heads in the late 70s and early 80s. There is something nice happening in New York City's music scene; this city is an incubator for truly innovative music (The Strokes are another case in point). The first two albums of VW are great, but, after two listens, I begin to think that this is, to date, their best. The music is more sophisticated and varied, and the album works really well as a whole. I don't listen to songs and rarely remember their names. I listen to albums taken as wholes. The music is immaculately created and the vocals quite brilliant. You have ears and taste, so I am not going to try to describe each song to you. All I want to say is that the opening track alone is worth the entire price of the album. And there are many tracks which, for me, come close to the brilliance of the opening song. I also like the VW's renditions of Elvis-style rock and roll and reggae, and that their album covers are so original and distinctive. The phrase \\"attention to detail\\" comes to mind. I highly recommend this album, and might, after more listens, elevate it to 5 stars.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|poorly written, boring book starts out slow and comes to a stop, could not finish it deleted it from my kindle.

0062255657|3.0|I love Neil Gaiman's body of work.  American Gods was as good as Sandman.  But then we are tantalized by a new adult novel (not that the kids' book were not exceptional) and its a novella that could have easily been written for all ages if he just took out the adultery.  Neil, I was hoping for a steak and I got a meat skewer.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like a challenge and this is a semi hard game to play. my grandsons 12 and 6 were solving it for me I had to take it away from them so I could play . Its fun I like the music. Amazon has alot of games in this area, .
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Sonic's one of my favorites and this doesn't disappoint.  It was a bit choppy and times and the screen showed boxes here and there. My WiFi was up and running well so my opinion is it's the programming.<br /><br />UPDATE: After getting through the first minutes on the iPad I switched to the Android tablet and haven't had ANY video issues since. I want to upgrade to 5 stars for Android,  2.5. For iPad.<br />This game is just as fun and addicting as it was the first time around! I recommend this to newbies as well as those who've played this before. So much fun, smooth video, controls are easy to use...what more can you ask for?  :-)
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Fun game, but the evolution needs work, you should be able to cancel evolution. But like I said, a awesome game.

162064309X|4.0|I received the audio version of this book in a timely fashion.  The audio version was purchased new, and the shrink-wrap was intact, but all of the CD's looked blemished.  I decided to listen to the book anyway.  On disc # 3, I was not able to listen to the last portion of it as the blemishes did cause a problem.  I have 3 CD's left to listen to and so far, no more issues.  I am enjoying the story.  The 100 year old man, Allen, is quite a character.  I do enjoy the main story and am bored at times by &#34;flash backs&#34; to Allen's earlier years.  All in all, an enjoyable read.  Our book group will no doubt have a fun discussion!  The 100 year old man reminds me of Forrest Gump at times.
B008TMOIEK|5.0|I don't usually listen to any sort of classical music but this album is lovely. The selections are a beautiful and some you can feel right to your soul.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I loved this book. Full disclosure: I run (a little) and so this topic speaks to me right off the bat, but the book covers so much ground that I imagine it would also appeal to non-runners. The main topic is long distance/endurance running (50+ mile races, some in very harsh conditions), with much discussion of ultra running as a sport in the US, an elusive tribe in mexico that runs very long distances in the desert partly as a cultural ritual, the sports medicine and footwear industry, and a really interesting overview of theory relating to long distance running and man evolving to walk upright.  The book is also sprinkled with some very eccentric characters and it was very well written and researched. My takeaway is not any burning desire to run faster or longer or to slip on a pair of those barefoot shoes (which the book mentions but doesn't particularly promote), but it validates my little 10-12 miles a week as something I can enjoy for what it is. My only complaint about the book is that I heard that Bruce Springton song playing in my head every time I picked it up. Couldn't be helped.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Really fun movie to watch with the kids! It's funny and clean humor. The kids absolutely have a blast every time we watch it ;)

0374533555|1.0|Kahneman attempts in this book to give a scientific exposition of various failings of humans' propensity to occasionally misinterpret certain numeric scenarios, and to make it sound new in the process.  The ideas he presents in this book are not new.  Some of them are from earlier articles, and others from his papers of 1983 and earlier.  As I read I felt Kahneman attempting to make his book entertaining, as Malcolm Gladwell does with similar subjects.  But where Gladwell succeeds in entertaining us, Kahneman fails miserably.  Neither does Kahneman adhere to any scientific method.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the coolest  the part that was hard was the victor battle<br />But then later I got the hang of it but I wonder if there is a ending to the game I like how it shows pics frome the movie.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I am enjoying the puzzles, particularly the variety.  5 stars for the content, minus 1star for invasive permissions.  The plot is thin, but quite adequate as a framework for the puzzles.  There is a mixture of complex and simple colors, textures and drawing in the scenes, which I have found to be pleasing, rather than inconsistent or jarring.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Dangerous is one of my favorite Michael Jackson albums along with Off the Wall. Even though they are two very different albums, more than 10 years apart, but they are both excellent. Off the Wall marks the start of Jackson's adult career, but Dangerous is the album where he really becomes an adult.<br /><br />The album has two main parts. Track 1-6 is the so called \\"New Jack Swing part\\". New Jack Swing was a branch of R&B that ruled the early 90s but then was blown away by the much more pessimistic and violent gangsta rap later. But make no mistake, Dangerous is NOT a New Jack Swing album - it's an album with NJS influences and elements, but I would not call it a NJS album. Even though I have seen it being cited as the best selling NJS album of all times. Well, except it's not a NJS album. But the first part of the album is heavily influenced by NJS - and who better to co-write and co-produce that than one of the fathers of NJS, Teddy Riley?<br /><br />The collaboration resulted in international hits such as Remember The Time, In The Closet and Jam. My favorite of this branch is perhaps In The Closet - a steamy, sexy, brave track -, but Remember The Time is close too. Jam sounds like a fun dance track on the surface, but pay attention to the lyrics! I also adore She Drives Me Wild. It took me time to really get this song - for a long time it was one of my least favorites on the album, but recently it became one of my favorites. I guess I just love the way MJ is talking about his girl on this track. My least favorite track on the album is also in the NJS part - Can't Let Her Get Away. I often skip this one.<br /><br />The second part of the album, track 7-13, is more a classic MJ sound. Here we have gems like Who Is It, which I seriously consider one of Michael's best songs EVER! In my book it's up there with Billie Jean, even if it's less of a dance song. I love its richness, the whole structure and composition, the passion, the darkness of it, the beatbox - I justLOVE everything about that song.<br /><br />Since Beat It Jackson made sure to include a rock song on every album (Beat It on Thriller, Dirty Diana on Bad). Dangerous' rock song is Give In to Me, featuring Slash on guitar. I love Beat It and its video, I also love Dirty Diana, but to me Give in To Me is arguably MJ's best rock song. I just love the emotions expressed in Michael's vocal delivery.<br /><br />There are also two gospel songs on the album: Will You Be There and Keep The Faith. The former was the bigger hit (well Keep The Faith was not released as a single). I love both. So much soul, emotion and passion in MJ's delivery! The poem at the end of Will You Be There is kind of prophetic, considering MJ's later life.<br /><br />Then there is Black or White, which was the albums lead single and biggest hit. I do not think it's one of the albums strongest songs, but it was a popular song, so it definitely has its place on the album. Gone Too Soon is an emotional song about Ryan White's passing. Heal The World is often scorned as cheesy and I can understand that, it's not one of the best songs on the album, but the reason why I can accept such songs from MJ is because he clearly meant them. The song's message, as optimistic (or corny, cheesy according to the cynics in us) as it is, was a part of MJ, so while it's not one of his greatest songs I'm not bothered by having it on the album.<br /><br />The last track on the album is the title track, Dangerous, which kind of summerizes the two main parts before it. Teddy Riley returns on this track as a co-writer, co-producer, but Bill Bottrell (who co-produced several songs of the second part) appears as a co-writer as well. So this song kind of unifies both big parts. I think this song should have definitely been a single. Too bad it wasn't.<br /><br />Overall the album is full of hits, very versatile musically and lyrically as well. It never gets boring and more than 20 years on it's still one of my favorite albums.
B009GEYX5E|4.0|Colorful Photos, takes a while to develope as expected, Need to keep out of light directly after taking the photo for best results.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game so much! It's really fun and simple and addictive. The minions are just the most cutest things in the whole world! Def recommend it
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Imaginative, fun, sweet, innocent, exciting, funny - has a little bit of everything. Great movie! It's refreshing to find a humorous, exciting, fun movie without all the junk you get on most movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! The minions, as usual, are hilarious. This gamr makes me smile every time I play it. The play is very similar to Temple Run. It goes faster as you get better, and you don't do the exact same run twice in a row.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Who knew a flick about a group of old f*rts going rogue and kicking some serious arse could be so much darn fun?  I stumbled across RED recently while channel surfing, and before I knew it, I was watching intently, a fixed grin on my mug.  When a group of former CIA ops reunites to take on a federal government bent on taking them out for knowing too much, with the Vice President himself (Julian McMahon) and an international weapons dealer (Richard Dreyfuss) pulling the strings, you've got a recipe for shoot-'em-up fun.  And the group of senior former spies?  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren (with a dazzling Mary-Louise Parker thrown in as love interest for Willis's character).  To watch this ensemble go to work--especially Mirren packing a machine gun--you can't help but love it, and have grand fun watching.<br /><br />Yet RED is more than violence and action-packed thrills; this movie has a razor sharp, never-ending comedic edge.  To watch Malkovich muck it up with an array of unreal weapons is sheer bliss; and the character actor Brian Cox adds his own brand of humor to the mix playing a former KGB adversary who is madly in love with the Mirren character.  The cast just meshes, and you can tell they had as much fun making RED as the viewer has watching RED.  It comes as no surprise this film spawned a sequel currently making the theatrical rounds; if one can have this much fun watching a group of seniors take no prisoners, then the sky's the limit when it comes to keeping the action coming as the RED franchise rolls merrily along.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B005PK56TA|4.0|It's been a while since I've seen a horror series that makes since from beginning to the end... The production as a whole is a job well done... Thanks and may GOD bless you!
B0091X2K0A|5.0|A great insight into how the toughest soldiers in America think and react in their jobs.  Keeps your attention throughout.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The only reason I took a star off this rating is because of the lack of apps. It's not really all that surprising because it's SDK is not even finished yet so Devs can't really publish to the Play Store just yet.<br /><br />One of the absolute best features of this (besides the easy setup) is the chrome browser extension Google Cast. With this extension you can send anything withing a browser to the chromecast. Not only that but there is an option to send the entire computer screen over to it as well. This feature in combination with powerful applications like Plex Media Server make this one of the best Streaming Media Players around, since you can stream anything on your PC to the device over WiFi.<br /><br />So far only 3 official apps exist, YouTube, Google Play Music and Google Videos. One very important thing to know about YouTube is that Live channels aren't supported just yet. They all give an error when trying to cast them over.<br /><br />If it were not for these small issues I would totally give it 5 stars. I plan on buying  a few more to replace my Roku once more apps start appearing on the device.<br /><br />Feel free to ask questions on this review and I'll try to respond to as many of them as possible.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|Tom cruise is 51 and shouldn't be acting anymore. This movie was borrowed from different other movies, like the Matrix, The Island, and Battleship it was easy for my brother and I to predict the entire movie in like 20 minutes. Why was his mind erased, why was his girlfriend mind erased. He kept having visions of his old life, but, we weren't suppose figure that out! I can't believe it grossed so much money, with that said, there was no blood in the movie what so ever, even though people were being blown up! It was extremely predictable, or maybe we just watch too many movies! I can't believe I wasted 14 dollars to rent this crap, well on to watching G.I. Joe, I wonder how that movie is going to impress me.LOL
B007MDB71O|4.0|John Carter is coming.  John Carter is coming.  Oh happy day when I first heard those words.  I have been an avid Edgar Rice Burroughs reader since I was a boy.  I have read most of the Tarzans.  All of the Pellucidar, Venus, and Barsoom books.  I knew John Carter as well as any fictional character.  I knew how Disney had done a decent job with the new Tarzan animated film.  And just like they had done with Tarzan, Disney has again taken many liberties with the mythology and crafted a recognizable story.<br />It is definitely not the book, but it is close.<br />The Therns are what bothers me more than anything, but I guess basing them on a strange technology was more believable than just allowing John Carter to be pulled to Mars through longing.  Aside from the Therns and thus everything that changes due to their new back story the movie was a great rendition of the Princess of Mars.<br />The Tharks on the other hand were awesome.  I wish they had been able to do more with the green men of Mars.  Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas was a great choice.  The honor and chivalry of the red men could have been explored more, but lets hope they can make up for these short comings with the next movie.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|All DVDs are in great shape. I enjoyed to watch them since I don't have cable. It is nice to have them in my hands.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|this is a super cute family movie.  Very funny some good adult humor.  The minions are the best part of the movie
B007NVIB5U|5.0|Finally a movie that is from all the trappings of the censors... You can learn a lot from these character.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this the day it came out and I love it, it works very well the reason why I gave it a 4 stars is because I can't find the Netflix code anywhere,can anyone help with this?
1400079144|1.0|There were so many technical errors that I found it difficult to read (had I not purchased it I would have given up very quickly).  Apparently neither the author nor the publisher found it necessary to talk to someone who knew something about computers or physics.  Moreover, the CIA is constrained by law from operating within the U.S.  I expected much better from Brown.  Had I read this prior to &#34;Inferno&#34; I never would have read the latter (nor anything else by the author).<br />RJC
B005544V6A|5.0|I am a late adopted by nature.  I like waiting until the jury is out on new shows before I get involved.  After watching the first two episodes I wished I started watching when this series originally aired.<br /><br />Great characters along with well cut clothing makes for a visually striking and intellectually stimulating viewing experience.<br /><br />Character Hidden Gem Alert: Luis - funny and passionate.
B0044KJIIC|2.0|No matter how good or bad the entire season is, the last episode just doesn't do it for me.  It resolves too many things very cheaply.
B008MM9630|4.0|I like that I can actually get gems easily and without real money. I also like how fast and fun the plants grow.
B00CW665VI|5.0|What a ride this was, I had reading this. Omg drew is freaking hot and also a mess lol, so glad to read a book in a man pov. The story was good as hell and can't get enough of mr drew Evans, he got the whole package, his friend Matt is funny as hell and perfect for dee-dee. I am so happy for Drew pov, the book was so well written I definitely recommend it to readers,
B00821PCJS|5.0|A great aspect of this show is its attention to the history of warfare and especially the long history of insurgency. Through out the ages insurgency has had a power role in shaping nations and societies. Love the shows use of asymmetric historical lessons and tactics.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching this program at the recommendation of a friend.  I am generally not interested in &#34;period pieces&#34; but this has suspense and interesting facts I wouldn't have known.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. Looking forward to seeing the flick. I really liked the book
B00C7O8TSM|3.0|The first rock and roll album I purchased, probably in 1963, was Surfing USA.  As I recall, and that may be flawed, the cover sported a big wave rider.  That, and the rock and roll inside, was heady stuff for a 13 year old after another northern Michigan winter.  I was, as the record instructed, 'stoked'.<br /><br />The performances on this disc are nearly perfect.  Nearly perfect, but something is missing.  What's missing are the Beach Boys, lost behind, or in front of, the very competent band that has been assembled.  The backing band effectively covers all the frailties.  After 50 years I can understand how the passion, and sometimes the abilities, wane.  And the passion has apparently waned, cause there ain't no bop on this record.<br /><br />The cost is minimal and I'm glad I bought it.  If you're not all that familiar with the BB, this might be an okay place to start.  If you're looking for live performances to make you tap your foot and rise from your seat, you may want to look elsewhere.  No stoking here.
B000I9YXHY|5.0|Barbara was so good in this. Hard to believe so much time has pasted. Everyone looks great but hair styles on men are crazy. Story line is good for time it was done. To cheesy by todays standards. And no bad words or sex! Gee, to me that is what made it good.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|interesting story to contrast all the reality programming out there. smart, unique, funny. i got hooked on this show in the later seasons, so using my amazon prime to go back from the beginning. love!
0684843749|5.0|book has everything about hitting every muscle group you want. Must have if want to learn different lifts and forms.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This new show on BBC America had me hooked from the first few minutes in what I would describe as the best debut ever! It is complicated, convoluted, smart, and a little funny. The characters are well done and the actors (especially lead actress Tatiana Maslany! who plays the many clones) are very, very talented. I am very excited to see where they take me next, but it will be a long wait until spring for the next season! Get the first season and join in on the fun, and the pain of waiting!
B0054LVP3Q|4.0|I recommended this book to a few people I liked it it was a fast read the ending left me going soooo now what I felt like there should one more chapter or the book ened like that with the intent for a second book... I'm not sure... But a good read for sure!
0307719774|5.0|Love how this book looks. I really thought about whether I should buy it or not because it was sort of expensive for me, but I hope tha it will be worth it when I read over my answers in 5 years. Like it so far.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This game was really great, and I got really far in it. But when I got the update, it deleted all of my progress ( I was level 30!) And I had to start again from the very beginning. So play at your own risk.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|i bought this case with my kindle and my only complaint is the color choices! i wish there were more!
B0050AV5MW|5.0|I've found the book series to be a great read so far. I've seen some of the series on tv so I decided to read the books. The books are way better with far less vulgarity in them. They develop the characters a lot more, but I feel that there is a little too much detail for my liking regarding everyones sigil on their flags and the great descriptions of everyones armor everytime they go into battle. Other than that a very exciting and interesting read.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy playing this game because I use it as a guest - similar to Facebook version.  A good time passer.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Love this app. Use it on my phone, my pc, my iPad and my kindle. Video quality is clear and good.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Reminded me why it was epic.  Compared to earlier science fiction programs it was more thought provoking--taking contemporary issues and extending them to their extreme.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Very few problems easy to use. I have the best luck now when I go out I know if I need to bring the umbrella or not.
B002LVVCQM|4.0|It was interesting and not too technical.  Very readable for someone interested in science for the layperson.<br />Thanks for making  available
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love the Despicable Me movies, and I also adore the minions. So I thought this game would be fun and a good fit for me, but really, it glitches and isn't the best quality you look for. It might be because of my bad internet connection, but I doubt it. Also, it's just like Subway Surfers or Temple Run, but you just collect bananas. I like games like this where you run as far as you can and collect things on the way, but there's a lot of them already like Temple Run or Subway Surfers. Also, there is not a big variety of minions / players you can choose from. Like Subway Surfers, you have a huge variety of players you can choose from. But Minion Rush only has the classic minion, dad minion, mom minion, baby minion, and a few more and I think that's it. I love this game, but it wasn't what I was really looking for.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|More stylized--Fellini-like--than I'd remembered it being, but still such a powerful filml. This is a film worth owning and re-watching.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|just started playing and i have to say the game is great i always wanted a horse now i have the chance to own one
B00DU74U74|1.0|Major plot pieces that gave the story great depth in the book were completely left out in the movie, leaving it rather flat. The acting was poor in parts, and very static. To be quite honest, what was a great story on paper did not work well on the screen, not because it was particularly difficult to adapt but due to a lack of understanding as to what the story was trying to tell.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|great characters; fun stories; interesting venues<br />renegade cowboys in space with their own code and morality but always have each other's backs

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|ok, so in all fairness, Steve Carell is hilarious to me. it's hard to lose when renting a movie with Steve Carell in the cast list, but I am an overprotective parent. I know the minions hit each other, and they xeroxed their rear-ends in one scene, but it really is a cute movie, with a good general message. Much better than i expected. And the mistreatment of the girls by the Orphanage lady is not portrayed as acceptable, it's just a flawed character that can allow you to converse openly with your growing, learning children. :)
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Not as clean & simple as Google reader but the more I use it the more I get used to it's interface. Regular updates and they seem to listen to their users. I for one am glad they stepped into the breach left by the demise of Google reader.
B0058VW36U|4.0|this game is a fun thing to play because you cut the rope and feed the monster with candy. I like the game because me and my friends can play on her I phone.
140006922X|1.0|Amazing, a devout muslim tries to rip down Jesus.  I noticed he made no effort to do this to the prophet Mohammed.  What trash.  No objectivity.
1476733953|5.0|Very well written, very interesting and very dynamic.  Keeps you engaged.  I hope he writes more about the next stage in these characters lives.
B007UXSKMU|5.0|I wanted to see this movie because of Tom Cruise doing his own stunts on the world's tallest building.  I was not disappointed.  This movie had terrific action sequences, heartstopping shots of Tom climbing up the side of the building, enough humor to make it fun, and a good plot.  I liked it so much after the first viewing that I viewed it again several more times.  It's hard to understand why Cruise was willing to do those stunts.  I know I wouldn't have been willing no matter what the paycheck looked like.  But they made the movie so exciting, I was on the edge of my seat.  The scenes on the Burj Khalifa were only part of the movie, too; there were several changes of scene and different problems to be solved, so the film keeps you interested all the way through with just the right amount of tension.  Highly recommend.  However, if you are really terrified of heights, this movie is probably not for you.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I use this bag to carry all my GoPro gear and i have plenty of room to spare. Dividers in the middle are velcro, so you can adjust the compartments to any size. Solid Contruction. Lots of Amazon Basic Logos.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|In less than two minutes I was up and running. The device turns my TV on and works flawlessly - it's simply amazing!<br />I've read tons of review from those who don't quite understand the product. Here's the thing - I have a smart TV, I have a Roku, and I have a Google TV... they all can stream YouTube and Netflix. But which one is best? Without question the Chromecast blows them all out of the water - I don't have to learn to use a new menu; the same menu I use on my phone and tablet is what controls this little device... perfectly!<br /><br />I've heard some say \\"It only works with Netflix and Youtube, and Google Play, and Google Play Music, - but I don't think they see that this device is brand new and is being promoted heavily.<br /><br />The code to make an app work with this device is extremely short.... there will be HUNDREDS of apps coming on line - there simply is NO GOOD reason for developers not to add this little bit of code to their applications. HBO GO, Pandora, Songza, and on and on and on WILL come on board. There is simply no reason they won't.<br /><br />For 35.00 you will have the easiest, cleanest, and best experience ever!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I love Denzel. I love airplanes. I didn't like this movie. Alcohols is painful, so I had a hard time. Besides that, I just didn't think the film was well done. Great concept that didn't work out so well.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Wish there was a way to fast forward on the ones I can't do. I use it everyday and like the variety
B005HYNCTA|5.0|Sometimes sold for a bargain price, this set can be a very worthwhile way of buying the three or four essential items contained within it. Many of the performances in this box are \\"merely\\" good and successful rather than distinctive and distinguished. Certainly this is not overflowing with wonders to the same extent as the companion \\"Bruckner\\" and \\"Symphonies\\" boxes are. But there is a very wonderful Scheherazade and a really powerful (and powerfully different) Tchaik 5. There is a really lovely - and again very different - Nutcracker Suite. These recordings are amongst my favourites of these works. I listen to them often and always with great pleasure. There is also an impressive Tchaik 4 and a good Prokofiev 5. La Mer is impressive also - if a little unidiomatic - and after a rather dreary first movement the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra is very worthwhile. The rest is worth sifting through - many seem to like the Pathetique but I find much of it prosaic. Buy the aforementioned other Celibidache Munich sets first but do at least sample this set's Tchaikovsky and Rimsky Korsakov.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Nice tablet for reading. Purchased a simple one for my husband so that he can enjoy his books. Needless to say he loves the convenience of it and of course the portability.
B005HYNCQ8|5.0|What an amazing box this is! It contains a Brahms symphony set of truly great performances (that are so distinctive that you need them regardless of which great versions you already have); a nearly complete Beethoven set (the 1st is missing but there are two different 4ths) of great distinction and with many must hear performances; three wonderful Schumann and distinctive symphonies ... plus some good very Haydn, a Mozart and an interesting Schubert \\"Great\\".<br /><br />It is so unfair. I know that many Anglo-Saxon listeners these days hate Celibidache's Munich performances - so I should warn you that you may not feel as I do about this music making - but I just cannot even begin to comprehend why! I have listened almost constantly for a month to this set (and in the months before that to other sets from this period of Celibidache's art) and cannot understand why so many listeners hear nothing but occasional slowness and then go onto equate that with being boring or indulgent.<br /><br />I suppose it is the Beethoven that is most likely to upset those listeners. Some speeds are unusually slow and Celibidache's Beethoven is a little smoother than is currently fashionable. and even those who enjoy the likes of Bohm and Klemperer in Beethoven may be shocked by how slow some of the scherzos are. But I find that if you give Celibidache's approach a chance it will usually explain itself and win you over. But you can sense some listeners waiting to be shocked, reaching for the score or the booklet and harrumphing to themselves (\\"this is supposed to be an allegro!\\"). In any case the music is taut and alive and the narrative is compelling. This is music making that aims to communicate, to enthrall, to uplift and to thrill. It is NOT an old conductor indulging his fine aesthetic sense - not even remotely. It is worth remembering that these are live performances from a conductor who refused to \\"can\\" his music by entering a studio. It has been a long time since I hear Beethovenperformances that have had the capacity of these accounts to make me listen afresh and with renewed pleasure.<br /><br />At least four of the Beethoven performances are in the \\"must hear\\" category. The 2nd is powerfully Beethovenian - the classical roots are most definitely underplayed - the Choral is astounding and powerful and, until the last movement (which is spoiled by very muddy choral work), is in the same league as Furtwangler's famous recording. The two 4ths are both astonishing. I find that, more than any other Beethoven symphony, I am often dissatisfied with accounts of this symphony. But here I find two different accounts that are quite simply wonderful. The 1995 account is to my mind the finest account on record and the 1987 account is, in it's way, almost as good.<br /><br />The others are also very worthwhile if not as great as these accounts. They all exhibit Celibidache's ability to make the music sing, to clarify lines of melody and harmony and to work towards and end. The 5th is very good - an impressive and memorable account; the Eroica and the Pastoral are both successful. The 7th is perhaps less satisfactory - for once Celibidache fails to convince me that his rather ponderous tempo for the first movement has a sound purpose. Things improve after that but it is only in the last movement that the performance really takes flight.<br /><br />And so the set goes on. The rest is just as special or more so.<br /><br />The Brahms should be less controversial. The speeds are generally within the normal range. These are powerful accounts in lovely sound. There are at least two other sets of Celibidache conducting these symphonies and both are excellent. This set is less thrilling and less driven but the performances are filled with lovely moments and details and are all totally involving.<br /><br />Celibidache's Schumann came as something of a surprise. Given his taste for clarifying textures and lines I had expected that he would be markedly successful in clarifying Schumann's allegedly muddy textures. But he does no such thing. He dives into them and enriches them and makes them generate a powerful, muscular and almost \\"geological\\" language to speak to us through. I know of no other Schumann accounts that seek to work in this way.<br /><br />Nearly every performance here succeeds on its own terms and so much that is here is really exceptional. I suspect that most prospective buyers will already have accounts of most of the music in this set. They will therefore be buying this set to hear something different, something out of the ordinary, something that will enrich their souls and fill them with the joy that only truly inspired music making can deliver. There is no reason on earth to hesitate!

B005HYNCTK|5.0|I first started listening to these recordings more than a year ago and I became hooked. I started with a download of the 8th and then of the 4th and then it began to be clear that I would need the whole set! (I advise you to resist the temptation to buy part of the set because sooner or later you will want them all and the set is by far the cheapest way to get them.) Since then these performances have changed the way I hear Bruckner and have greatly deepened my understanding of and love for his music. Hearing Bruckner in these performances has helped me to get more real enjoyment from many of the more \\"compact\\" accounts of these astonishing works - I mean those by Karajan, Wand, Jochum ... and just about everyone else!<br /><br />Celibidache's accounts are considerably longer than those of other conductors: the extra length is accounted for by Celibidache greatly expanding and opening out the language of one or more of the movements. Some - those, perhaps, who haven't really listened to these accounts - joke that he is boring and tedious but the very opposite is the case. Here, time stands still and yet passes rapidly. The music really talks and you can't help but concentrate on what it is saying. Richter's Schubert achieves something similar for me.<br /><br />The great virtues of these recordings are concerned with the space that the music is given to tell its story in a really compelling way, clarity of line and harmony, beautiful playing, excellent sound and, most of all, the capacity to uplift you as only great Bruckner can. Celibidache's Bruckner really sings!<br /><br />There is something of a myth that this set is of greatly uneven quality. If you read around the critical views of this set you will find many critics observing that the quality of the set is mixed but there seems to be very little agreement about which the bad ones are! Not all the performances here, I suppose, are the equals of the magnificent accounts of the 4th and 5th (and, most would accept, the 6th) but each one is a noted success and well worth getting acquainted with. The 3rd is as compelling as any I have heard, as is the 9th. These two seem to me to be of a similar quality to the famous 4-6. The 8th wanders a little but why not? It is a pleasure to wander with it. The 7th is of a slightly lower voltage than the rest of the set but is still an enjoyable and uplifting account.<br /><br />I recommend this set to everyone. Many will disagree with me that it could make a great introduction to Bruckner (there seems to be an idea that only experienced Brucknerians should be exposed to Celi's eccentric ways but I can't believe that anyone could remain cold to this wonderful music making). I imagine more will agree that it is a must hear set for Bruckner fans.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|My first impression of the synopsis wasn't flattering, BUT, after reading the book, it became clear the story, although similar, really took on a life of it's own and converted me to a fan.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This review is simultaneously one of the easiest and the most difficult to complete. That's because this show, House of Cards, is indeed an excellent show in its own right, but the fact remains that it is also based on a much earlier show originally produced in the UK: because many \\"derivative\\" TV shows are not up to their predecessors' level, that complicates such a review. But I'm happy to say that, in this case, the derivative show is as good as the original version (although many of the specifics surrounding the story have been changed to suit the American audience). Let me talk a little bit about that and then provide some information about the current disc I'm reviewing here.<br /><br />House of Cards was originally created in 1990, and was focused on the UK political scene immediately after Margaret Thatcher left office. More specifically, the show centered on the political ins and outs of particular individuals in the Tory party working within the power vacuum after Thatcher's exit in the Westminster setting. The main character of the show, Francis Urquhart (played by Ian Richardson, a Scottish Shakespearean actor of great acclaim), was slighted by his party, and he embarked on an agenda to \\"right matters,\\" at least in his own mind, by forwarding his own personal agenda at the expense of others in the government. That's really all I'll say about it, because I don't want to give too much of the story away. Much of the enjoyment from watching the original House of Cards comes from watching Urquhart work his way through this process of self-promotion, and so giving away specifics about the story would not here serve any valuable purpose. This BBC-produced show was wildly popular in the UK, even though it consisted of only a limited number of episodes, and was revisited in two more seasons, first in 1993, and then again in 1995.<br /><br />In spite of the shows great popularity and success, one of the reasons that gives us pause in wondering if such a show could be successfully translated to the American context is the different manner in which the British people view government as compared to their American cousins. There is a playfulness, no, even more so a subtle mockery that borders on bemusement of politicians in the original BBC series, and this is not a trait held by the vast majority of American people, in spite of their negative view of many and political life.<br /><br />And it is here that we can begin discussing the American House of Cards production, which was produced by Netflix in 2012. The show has now been fully Americanized, not just in the names and places and features of the political landscape, but in the manner in which politics is carried out in the United States. This has allowed the migration of the original concept into the American setting, but with the addition of new twists and features that are not present in the UK political setting. The overall story plot is the same in that story focuses on a relatively high level politician who feels slighted by his own party and then seeks to gain an upper hand in responding to the slight. But the adaptation to the American context is exceptionally well done, and this makes the 2012 Netflix House of Cards completely worthy of consideration along with the original series. It's it's a show about power, politics, and betrayal, and if you are interested in politics and how the behind-the-scenes work is sometimes carried out, this is a show for you. It's not a show full of action, car chases, or even arguments, but that doesn't mean that it's uninspired or uninteresting. If you like to be challenged in your thinking, and enjoy plot twists, intrigue, and mystery, this is a show you'll certainly want to watch. And you can do so without ever having seen the original UK version. Having said that, if you watch House of Cards and enjoy it, and if you have any interest in UK politics at all, then I highly recommend that you go back and view the original UK version, all three seasons. (And although the original UK version is in three seasons, because there are only four episodes per season, there are only a total of 12 episodes for the entire three season run. This is the same number of episodes as in the first season of the American version of House of Cards season one.)<br /><br />You may have heard that House of Cards 2012 was done by Netflix and was not shown on any broadcast channel or even any cable channel. This may be a sign of a newly emerging Netflix producing shows that come can compete with some of the best of HBO and Showtime. The show is every bit the equal of some of the best of these cable offerings, has extremely strong acting, and very good production values. Kevin Spacey's acting is excellent, right on the correct note, and his was an excellent casting decision, much as he and Richardson's casting as Francis Urquhart in the original UK version was also superb. Nearly everyone who has seen House of Cards 2012 season one is anxiously awaiting season two. Five stars.<br /><br />Note:<br />The Original UK Version: [[ASIN:B00ANDPGJE House of Cards Trilogy: The Original UK Series Remastered [Blu-ray]]]ll three seasons.

B0050AV5MW|4.0|I found this book thoroughly entertaining and deeply engrossing.  Martin introduces the reader to a rich and detailed kingdom of fantasy.  I frequently found it difficult to put the book down.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Easy, yet fantastic read - one of Spark's absolute best novels. Always kept you on the edge of your seat...hoping & praying it might end differently but learning so much about true love along the journey.
B00B2FLDRQ|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a number of people who highly praised it.  I found it to be highly over-rated.  At first I was attracted to the author's new take on autism but was increasingly put off by the story line which became tedious and predictable.  The book is of some value and makes a quick read, but certainly does not deserve the hype it has received.  I expect it will shortly be turned into a movie of even less value.
B008Q08EG8|5.0|Two of Hollywood's best with complete opposite roles creating a classic that never loses it's powerful storyline. Amazon Prime does it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed the combination of characters, premise, plausibility, setting, and well paced plot. All the ingredients for a great read.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|As I started reading this book the story seemed great. A world hidden within our own. An amazing thought. As I read on the book got slow. It was still really good but I had to set it down. I kept on reading and it got better and faster pace. It was getting great. It was great! This book is amazing when you really get into it. I think you should read this if you love drama and action. I loved in the end. The slowness in the beginning did make this not the best it could be.

B008GXHOFW|5.0|I bought this game for my grandsons ages 7 and 4. They LOVE it! It took them no time at all to learn to play. It is a little advanced for the 4 year old, but with his brother's help he is learning quickly. This is a great game!!!
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|This game is fun because you can take out all the thorns. That's what my five year old says. I personally find it pointless, but he loves it. In order to really enjoy it, you have to purchase the upgraded medical kits, and the default kit has severe limitations. However, my little one really has fun playing this game.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app because it makes it so easy to know where my battery life is. It was easy to install and works like a charm. I love things that make using the Kindle Fire HD easier and faster. Thanks for a great app!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Is this Ireland in the 1950s?  No, it's setting is more current than that.  As the reader becomes acquainted with the back story of the characters we slowly learn to care for both of them. Charmed, irritated, shocked, pleased, angered are some of the emotions I felt while reading this novel.  Be sure to read the authors comments about some Irish orphanages.  It explains the male character's  behavior.  He's a survivor.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is an awesome game to pass time. This is my 1 game in having fun. You'll love this game that's all I got to say.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, addictive and it has minions. What else could you want in a game?! Both Despicable Me movies were awesome and the game doesn't disappoint.
B00005N6KG|2.0|These headphones hurt the insides of my ears and the sound quality is not the best.  I wouldn't buy them again.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Based on previews, I thought this would be more fantasy than children's movie. At minimum I thought it was one of those kids movies that would be entertaining none the less. It was neither. Poor effects and hokey script. I did not enjoy this at all. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 since kids may like it.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|I understand this was a great love story for some. It came across as sappy to me. It was ok, but a little like the title... another title could have been \\"Too Much\\". Too much sap, too much story, too far fetched, too much...
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun game this game has some good stuff in it I would download it if I were you it has army upgrades the lottery and tons more
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Not like any other film I've ever seen. I wish I had read the book first. Seemed like it would have been right up my alley. Great epic movie to watch if you have the time.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Just finished the first of the fhs staff book club summer reads. Pretty good. Its also on the student summer reading list and i'm sure the kids will like it too.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|A friend recommended I watch Fringe years ago in the first season. It was either on too late or something else was on at the same time. Either way, I re-discovered Fringe in the past 2 weeks. I've already devoured 10 episodes. In fact, I spent all day one Sunday watching Fringe back to back! Great science fiction series. I highly recommend.
B00E25KVLW|5.0|I read and did the exercises for the first 6 chapters of \\"Ruby on Rails 3.2 - Step by Step\\" online, and it is the best. Rails is a challenge, but this book makes it do-able.  The explanations are clear, the links for more information are relevant, and the repetitive nature of the exercises actually makes the process of development second nature.  Doing ALL the exercises is the key, even if you read it, and say \\"I know what's going on\\", a month from now when you want to create a 1:n association, you will have forgotten, but by doing all the exercises, you get it, and you remember!<br /><br />I am buying the book for 4.0 for two reasons -<br /><br />1)  The install I ended up with is rails 4.0, and many of the examples no longer work.  Searching the web for how to adapt them has been instructive, but it is slowing my progress.<br /><br />2) I want to support this author, he has done a great service for helping unravel the mysteries of how rails works, ones that the typical blog tutorial doesn't really address.<br /><br />My only comment on improvement would be to cover other methods for installation - RVM actually was not very nice in my case - I have a project I am working on, and it messed with my path in ways that made me have to uninstall RVM and go with homebrew...<br /><br />In closing, excellent work, you will not be disappointed...
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|the game itself is fun but the constant vibrating that you can not ever turn off kills any game play. sadly I have to uninstall because of this. Samsung<br />galaxy s 3
B004P12SSW|5.0|This movie is fun and uplifting. Christina has an AMAZING voice which helps to balance out her ok acting. Cher is always a treat to watch. The actors they chose for the parts are perfect. It's mainly a movie that entertains. You'll want to get up and dance for sure.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|The scenery is stunning.  The stars (and everyone in this series shines) are listed aphabetically, because no one role is bigger than another.  Every actor is important to this series.  I can't say enough about how wonderful it is.  But be prepared to sit in front of your tv for hours on end, because once you enter the lives at Downton Abbey, you won't want to do anything else.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I loved the movie and am glad I seen it in 3D.  Read the books when I was a kid and was glad they did the books justice which movie makers are not always mindful of doing.  I've seen it several times since and still giggle when John Carter is trying to first learn to walk on Mars! Would love to see a sequel.

B00DAXXO98|5.0|Great show.  Lots of twists and turns in the plot.  Very engaging and has great acting.  I was sorry to have it end.
B00AEBB9CS|4.0|Pretty dark movie. But Daniel day Lewis is probably the greatest actor of this or any generation. Supporting cast was also terrific.
0446580848|3.0|I have purchased several books on line labeled the condition as &#34;good&#34; but this one was less than good. The binding was broken. I have to be careful reading that I don't break it in two. I didn't expect &#34;excellent &#34; but I did think it would be in a little better condition.

B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is absolutely brilliant. I cannot praise the creators enough. This game is fun, you can be so creative in making your city. The interface, for example how you place buildings, is brilliant and very simple and easy to use. The different missions you can complete are interesting and actually move your game forward. There are endless possibilities. The decorations an  the mass transit system are wonderful and easy to use. The game can also be quite challenging, which makes for a fun, interesting experience. Anyone who likes city simulation type games that feed the imagination and encourage creativity, this is great for them.

140006922X|1.0|[...]  A response to Zealot by Dr. Gary Manning (Ph.D. in New Testament)    Reza Aslan's new book, Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth (Random House, 2013), is in most ways a typical attempt to paint a new picture of Jesus. Because so many hundreds of books of this type have been published, Aslan's book would most likely not have received significant attention at all, except for two factors. First, a botched interview of the author on Fox News caused a huge surge of interest, making his book an overnight best seller. And second, Aslan is a very good writer. His primary teaching role, after all, is as a professor of creative writing at UC Riverside. Aslan is able to take a lot of important historical background and present it in a riveting manner, accessible to most readers.    Since Aslan is a Muslim, some have responded to Zealot as if it is a Muslim look at Jesus. This is simply not the case; Zealot does not present traditional Muslim views of Jesus at all.  Zealot is instead typical of other modern skeptical approaches to Jesus. Aslan is strongly influenced by (among others) John Dominic Crossan, the Jesus Seminar author who has written a number of books presenting Jesus as a peasant social revolutionary.    The central argument of Zealot is this: Jesus, like other messianic figures of his day, called for the violent expulsion of Rome from Israel. Driven by religious zeal, Jesus believed that God would empower him to become the king of Israel and overturn the hierarchical social order. Jesus believed that God would honor the zeal of his lightly armed disciples and give them victory. Instead, Jesus was crucified as a revolutionary. Early Christians changed the story of Jesus to make him into a peaceful shepherd. They did this for two reasons: because Jesus' actual prediction had failed, and because the Roman destruction of rebellious Jerusalem in AD 70 made Jesus' real teachings both dangerous and unpopular. Paul radically changed the identity of Jesusfrom human rebel to divine Son of God, against the wishes of other leaders like Peter and James.    To be fair to Aslan, there are several strengths to his book. He explains well the multifaceted economic, political and religious setting of first-century Palestine (with some exceptions pointed out below). While heavily influenced by Crossan, he abandons some of Crossan's more bizarre claims. Interestingly, Aslan points out what strong eyewitness evidence there is for the resurrection, although ultimately he says that the resurrection is the sort of thing that historians simply cannot evaluate. He points out that Jesus' contemporaries fully believed that Jesus performed healing miracles. Aslan also explains some things that most Christians are not aware of, but are widely accepted by both believing and non-believing scholars of the gospels. For example, Aslan correctly writes that Jews before Jesus were not expecting the messiah to be divine or for him to die and rise from the dead. He correctly explains the original significance of some of Jesus' titles such as \\"Son of God\\" and \\"Son of Man,\\" both of which had kingly connotations before Jesus.    However, Zealot is seriously flawed in many ways. There are many factual errors (some of which I will highlight below), but more importantly, Aslan's approach matches the flawed approach of Jesus Seminar scholars, which is almost guaranteed to produce a skewed picture of Jesus.    Zealot's claim is essentially a conspiracy theory: Jesus was really a proclaimer of violent revolution, but the gospels and Paul covered up the evidence. Aslan then has a typical conspiracy-theory approach: any time the gospels present evidence against Aslan's theory, they were making it up; any time the gospels present evidence in favor of Aslan's theory, they were telling the truth. This is found countless times in Zealot, but a few examples will suffice.    Aslan is certain that Jesus never said \\"My kingdom is not of this world\\" (John 18:36), because of course that would be evidence against Aslan's theory. The idea that Jesus was \\"an inveterate peacemaker\\" is a \\"complete fabrication\\" by the evangelists.1 Apparently, according to Aslan, Jesus never said \\"If anyone compels you to go one mile, go with him two\\" (Matt 5:41, talking about submission to soldiers who demand labor) or \\"Do not resist the one who is evil\\" (Matt 5:39). Although Aslan does not deny the historicity of Jesus' parables, he dismisses them as impossible to understand - a claim that would surprise most modern scholars of the gospels. Aslan needs to dismiss the parables because the Kingdom of God described in the parables is mostly incompatible with violent revolution.    But Aslan is perfectly willing to accept the gospels' testimony whenever it helps him. He accepts the historicity of sayings from Jesus such as \\"I have not come to bring peace, but a sword\\" (Matt 10:34) and \\"the kingdom of God suffers violence, and the violent take it by force\\" (Matt 11:12).  Of course, Aslan ignores the clear context of those sayings, which has nothing to do with violent revolution. Aslan mostly dismisses the gospel accounts of Jesus' arrest as entirely fictional, so he does not accept that Jesus stopped Peter from using a sword: \\"Put back your sword... For all who take up the sword will die by the sword\\" (Matt 26:51-52). But Aslan is quite willing to accept that Luke is correct when he records Jesus saying, earlier that evening, \\"Let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one\\" (Luke 22:36). This pattern is repeated over and over in Zealot. It is simply an unfair and extremely biased treatment of the historical evidence. It presents Aslan as somehow having secret knowledge that allows him to correctly identify when the four evangelists were accurate and when they were fabricating. In reality, Aslan is simply ignoring most of the evidence against his theory.    The second big thrust of Zealot's claim is that the peaceful, divine Jesus was made up primarily by Paul. According to Zealot, Peter and James sharply opposed Paul's claim that Jesus was divine. The New Testament on several occasions does describe conflict: between Paul and Barnabas, between Paul and Peter, and between Paul and men from James. Aslan tries to pretend that all these arguments were about the identity of Jesus, and that Barnabas, Peter and James believed in Jesus as a human messiah against Paul's view of a divine Christ. But this is simply nonsense. The disagreement between Paul and Barnabas is over the inclusion of Mark in their mission team, and Paul's disagreement with James and Peter is over whether Gentiles need to keep Jewish laws such as circumcision and food laws.    Here again, Aslan is very selective in his use of evidence. He accepts the letter of James as being authorized by James, because it helps him emphasize (and exaggerate) differences between James and Paul. But he never even mentions the epistles of Peter, because of course they show that Peter is in agreement with Paul about who Jesus is. While pointing out the difference between James' and Paul's theology, Aslan doesn't mention that James has an equally high view of Jesus: he is \\"our glorious Lord Jesus Christ\\" (James 2:1) who will return to judge (James 5:7). Aslan also ignores all of the evidence in the New Testament for agreement and harmony between the apostles, such as Paul's collection of money for poor Jewish Christians in Jerusalem.    Aslan's conspiracy approach continues in this section of his book. Why does Paul make a sacrifice in Jerusalem? It must be that James forced him to recant his heretical views, not (as Luke claims) to complete a Nazirite vow that Paul voluntarily began before arriving in Jerusalem. Why does Luke end the book of Acts with Paul's imprisonment, not his death? It must be to cover up some damning evidence against Paul! (No mention of the idea that Luke ended Acts then because that's when he wrote Acts).    Perhaps not surprisingly, theclaims in Zealot come with a fair degree of scholarly arrogance (which I acknowledge many scholars are prone to!). Aslan says that his goal is to \\"purge the scriptures of their literary and theological flourishes and forge a far more accurate picture of the Jesus of history... Everything else is a matter of faith.\\" In other words, when Aslan accepts some information from the gospels and rejects the rest, that is scholarly and historical; but if someone accepts other information from the gospels, their view is not scholarly or historical, but \\"a matter of faith.\\" The parts of the gospels that Aslan agrees with are historical; the parts that he doesn't agree with are \\"literary and theological flourishes.\\" Of course, Aslan often tries to explain why he thinks that some claim in the gospels is unhistorical, but taken as a whole, it is impossible to ignore the essential arbitrariness of his choices.    This scholarly hubris is also apparent in Zealot's determination to point out contradictions in the New Testament accounts. For example, Aslan wants to make sure that we know that Luke is mistaken when he says that the seven Hellenistic deacons (Acts 6) were primarily in charge of distributing food. They also engaged in preaching and evangelism, Aslan tells us. How does Aslan know that Luke is wrong? By reading the rest of Acts 6 and 7. In other words, Luke was not wrong - he just had more to say on the next page. Aslan is convinced that Pilate's trial of Jesus is \\"a complete fabrication\\" by the evangelists, because Aslan is certain that he knows how Pilate thinks. Pilate, in Aslan's telling, would have absolutely no problem sending someone to the cross without any trial at all. He bases this on a single line from the Jewish philosopher Philo, exaggerated out of proportion.    Finally, despite his generally good understanding of the field, Aslan makes a number of significant errors. I took pages of notes just on historical and linguistic errors in Zealot. Here are only afew examples of significant scholarly errors: use of Greek definitions not found in any standard Greek lexicon; using the wrong Greek lexicon for the New Testament; incorrect definition of the targumim; unawareness of the evidence for high literacy in ancient Israel; unawareness of literary approaches to the gospels; claims that violence against foreigners was the only faithful Jewish response; claims that Pilate crucified \\"thousands upon thousands\\" without trial; very late, unlikely dates for the writing of the four gospels; claims that ancient people did not understand the concept of history; claims that Luke was knowingly writing fiction, not history; claims that Mark does not describe Jesus' resurrection; and on and on. In many cases, I had to come to the conclusion that Aslan was just not familiar enough with modern scholarship related to the New Testament.    There are numerous other problems with Zealot, too numerous to address in an already-too-long blog post. Aslan repeatedly presents highly unlikely interpretations of passages in the New Testament, makes little effort to defend those interpretations, then moves on as if he has made his case. Suffice to say this, as others have said before: there is something a little bizarre about using our only historical documents about Jesus (the New Testament) to come to conclusions quite in opposition to those documents. There is a good reason to believe that Jesus claimed to be a divine king and savior who would die and rise again, and would one day return to judge the world: All four gospels, and indeed the entire New Testament make this claim. You can deny that this claim is true, but it is scholarly folly to deny that Jesus and the early Christians believed it.  ========  For a crtique on the use of the \\"Q\\" document that Reza likes see Dr. G. Boyd's (Ph.D. from Princeton) book \\"Jesus Under Siege\\".    ====================================  See also...[...]

B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved Hosseini's other two books, so was looking forward to reading this one.  I found it confusing.  I couldn't get the names and people straight.  Also, it jumped around from person to person, and story to story.  Just when I thought it was going to make some sense and have a story line to it, it didn't.  I depended on the high rating, plus my past experience with this author in making my decision to make my purchase.  This book was very disappointing.

Waited about 10 days for it to come in. Then When I opened the box. The blu ray was not wrapped, It was opened, the bottom of the case was broken, the booklet had finger creases, the disc had dust on the back. And the case itself was scratched and foggy like used items. Im very dissapointed with the delivery of this item and the fact I got a used copy for the full price of a promised new copy. I took a new blu ray case from a different movie and replaced it so I feel less upset.<br /><br />Amazing Movie tho, worth every penny and more!! :)

B000001ESJ|5.0|1976 proved a red letter year for Rush as the[[ASIN:B000001ESF 2112]] album officially put them in the map in terms of being a hugely successful power trio in what they were calling the AOR/progressive rock genre. However that leads me to one of the things I like about Rush so much: without thinking too much about it their music evades attempts to classify it in any serious way. It has prog,hard rock,jazz fusion,European folk and classical elements all finding this wildly cinematic clarity of purpose in music made by three not so out of the ordinary human beings. With drummer/lyricist Neil Peart's love of classic literature having become an integral element in their music,this album began the gradual process of Rush adapting their sound to be...well as commercially successful as it was ever going to be able to get.<br /><br />  The title song begins the album with Alex Lifeson's intertwining melodies on classical guitar before going into a very groove based rocker with a strong,solid melody. \\"Xanadu\\" loops a musing on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's [[ASIN:B006RBA09M Kubla Khan]] into one of their progressive suites-starting out very ambient before building into some expansive solos from Lifeson as Geddy vocally glides atop Peart's elaborate percussion/drum parts-featuring what I believe to be Geddy's first use of synthesizers in Rush. \\"Closer To The Heart\\" is probably Rush's most popular hit song up to this point-considering how musically involved it is on Rush being one of the most \\"progressive\\" of the prog rock era-with it's climactic changes in tempo from European folk to hard rock. \\"Cinderella Man\\" is another of the bands more direct rockers-still featuring from potent progressive sections.<br /><br />  \\"Madrigal\\" is a brief acoustic folk type ballad with some wonderful glassy productions and is one of my favorites here. My personal favorite though is \\"Cygnus X-1\\",beginning with a strong and almost funky opening bass groove from Geddy before Neal and Alex's rhythmically explosive guitar and drum sound gets right into full gear. Though sometimes written off the as \\"pretentious\\" as any prog rock band would be to mainly punk enthusiasts, this album comments,perhaps unintentionally, on the importance of art/progressive rock's embrace of creativity and expansion: through the metaphors of classic literary references. There is something very unpretentious about this actually. It's rock that is passionate rather than angry, analytical rather than clever. One of the most musically and lyrically telling classic rock albums ever made.lly explosive guitar and drum sound gets right into full gear.

B00BWJARHO|3.0|They are trying to squeeze too many movies out of this book! The scenery is quite pretty and the music is nice but the plot really drags. I think the Hobbit would have worked better as a single movie rather than three but they know us too well! Take all of our money Peter Jackson! Please! I'm not saying it's not worth watching but it wasn't worth $3.99 to rent. I should've waited for Redbox or Netflix.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|well, while it's NOT really agatha christie, and she didn't actually visit the legendary garden of good and evil, this book read like it!<br /><br />i found the plot interesting, the twists surprising, and the fact that it all wound up, tightly wrapped up, in the end, with a large fluffy bow was perfection!  i wasn't looking for a serious, somber read, i wanted something like - pie... lemon merinque pie, which melts in your mouth and engulfs your senses, and this book did just that!<br /><br />it read like a proposal for a movie or tv series, and i have to say that i'd gladly watch it, if it were developed in that direction.  and, i'd dearly love to read a sequel (or two, or three).<br /><br />one note, some reviewers were annoyed that the point of view kept changing - character, time, location... i actually enjoyed it more for all that.  the chapter which repeats is a similar vehicle to the scene which repeats in 'fried green tomatoes' (the movie)... it serves to anchor the piece, and let you know that, finally, you're caught up on all the back stories and can proceed to the conclusion.

B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Starlink is a Real-Time Strategy game. In it, you play a galactic emperor or something who wants to take over the universe. You start out with one system that is linked to several other systems, and you build and send out \\"ships\\" (they are really just dots) along these links to colonize those systems. Each system you colonize will produce more ships, which you can send down more links, and so on. Eventually, you encounter an adversary who also has designs on conquering the universe and a fight begins.<br /><br />Combat basically consists of two or more parties sending ships into a system where they destroy each other at a ratio of 1:1. To get ahead, you have to send ships into the system faster than the enemy can destroy them. You can do this by sending ships in from multiple systems, building ships in the system if you already control it, or using a variety of other techniques or purchasable abilities to get the ratio in your favor. Once you have numerical superiority for a while, the system will change from enemy to neutral then neutral to controlled, and start producing ships for you.<br /><br />Ship construction is all automatic, with each system producing ships at a steady rate, and either keeping them there or sending them down whatever starlink you have instructed that system to send ships down. If a ship arrives at a friendly system and that system has orders to send ships away down a particular link, those ships will automatically keep going to the next system. This will continue until you tell the system to stop. This can be handy as it lets you quickly tell systems deep inside your territory where to send ships then not bother with them again, but leads to a danger of getting distracted while you are moving ships around your front lines and not realizing that you have left a system undefended.<br /><br />Starlink gets a four from me. The game is pretty and relatively easy to play. The randomized layouts and different advantages or disadvantages of systemsensure a different game each time. The good AI can keep you on your toes, and doesn't really cheat as far as I can tell, always using abilities that would be available to a human player. And you can adjust the difficulty fairly easily if you are playing against the computer, to say nothing of challenging yourself with different ability sets.<br /><br />The learning curve is a bit steep though, with no real tutorial and a list of abilities that are not very intuitive. You don't really see any combat either, just dots going traveling across links, and some glowing stuff at points of contention that indicates a fight is going on. And once you figure out the basic structure of the game, you can figure out some game breaking strategies pretty quickly (stranding enemy fleets in dead end systems with the Destroy Link ability is my favorite).

6305128952|2.0|I love Robert Redford and usually greatly appreciate his work.  Not this time.  The implausibilities in this film are endless.  The girl is told she has to help with the horse because she will be riding him.  But, evidently, not until the last day.  Then she walks with only one leg and no limping either.  Who is she--Jesus Christ?  The mother who has no time for anything or anyone except her career all of a sudden sacrifices it to take her daughter and the injured horse \\"thousands of miles\\" away?  I don't think so.  We see no care of the horse on the way.  How did she accomplish this when he is so wild she can't get near him? etc. etc. etc.  The language is condescending for the first half--so trite and predictable that I thought the movie was for young kids--until the romance scenes, which were definitely designed for the older population.  The movie comes off stupid.  I haven't read the book and don't intend to.  But this is a sad situation because the story line is good.  The presentation was rotten.  I gave it 2 stars only because the scenery was beautiful.

0385349947|5.0|As a stay-at-home mom and a feminist, I felt empowered and occasionally discouraged as I read Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. Ultimately, the things I learned benefited me and I closed the book liking Ms. Sandberg very much due to her candidness about her own life, and her team-values. Her research was thorough and brought a full picture of the sexism women face in the workplace, from both men and women. One study that showed that both women and men tend to dislike successful women was particularly helpful for me, in looking at my own past decisions and in helping me re-evaluate the way I see other women.<br /><br />The only negative thing I might point out is that, as I read, my heart ached for her kids sometimes. The sacrifice of time with her kids is worth it to her, but will it always be, and is it now worth it to her kids? Who knows, but I wondered. But, it should be pointed out that she has made innovative changes in her schedule and taken career risks for the sake of her children. She has encouraged women and men to ask for what they need to support their families. She has forged an egalitarian relationship with her husband, who has been a fully involved father. Basically, she has done everything she could to raise her kids well while not being present with them as much she and they might like. (See, I like her so much I can't really criticize without adding lots of positives!).<br /><br />I am very excited about the way she is using the book to build women up in various ways around the world. She is definitely a feminist in the best sense of the word--an empowering activist who understands what women are up against, yet pushes us to overcome.<br /><br />One thing I should add, because I have found it contradictory, is the tendency of Facebook itself to seem anti-feminist--e.g. the domestic violence ads that were finally taken down, and some of the other things that denigrate women that have been allowed on Facebook in the name of free speech. (Yet, with photos of breastfeeding women censored). Unsure of the source of all that. Plus the collusion with the government regarding allowing access to our private information: there are probably pressures there beyond the scope of feminism; nonetheless, they seem counter to Ms. Sandberg's candidness and integrity.
