It has been ranked in the top 10 of business books of all time!  The reason I choose it is because you can read so much into it, it can be used for lots of different aspects of business and social media is one of them.<br /><br />Here are some extracts from the book which can help you with your social media marketing...<br /><br />You'll look up and down streets.  Look `em over with care.<br />About some you will say, \\"I don't choose to go there.\\"<br />With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet<br />you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street<br /><br />And you may not find any<br />you'll want to go down.<br />In that case, of course,<br />you'll head straight out of town<br /><br />Get it?  Use your head and choose your social networks carefully and don't feel you need to stay where everyone else is, do what's right for you.<br /><br />You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.<br />Some windows are lighted.

How much can you win?<br /><br />And IF you go in, should you turn left or right...<br />or right-and-three-quarters?  Or, maybe, not quite?<br />Or go around back and sneak in from behind?<br />Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,<br />for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.<br /><br />This place where the streets are not marked is for many of us social media, we don't know which way to turn, how to make up our minds on the best way to go.  It's all about exploration and trying things to see if they work and if they don't then change them.<br /><br />You'll get mixed up, of course,<br />as you already know.<br />You'll get mixed up<br />with many strange birds as you go.<br />So be sure when you step.<br />Step with care and great tact<br />and remember that Life's<br />a Great Balancing Act.<br />Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.<br />And never mix up your right foot with your left.<br /><br />Words of encouragement, but also words of warning, you can't be complacent and stick with the same all the way along, you need to balance and change things up.<br /><br />I love this book, and will often go back and read it, as it is all about life's ups and downs, but also encouraging, and enlightening if you can apply the lessons in it to what you are dealing with in business.<br /><br />Check it out and have a laugh, remember to make it fun and your readers will enjoy it to!<br /><br />Next week there will be a more \\"serious\\" book, but until then enjoy your social media exploits.Life's  a Great Balancing Act.

0743496736|5.0|I finished this book several days ago and it still sits with me.  I was amazed at how Jodi Picoult could write from the perspective of all of the players involved and make you feel for each and every one.  It is truly an eye opener as to how bullying can get so out of hand.  A few kids can think they are having fun and destroy the life of another.  The story is potent and oh so well written!!
0061914177|4.0|Good Morning, Social Rabbit here with your guide to the world of social media.    Today I'm reviewing the book Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passionby Gary Vaynerchuk.  This book is a very easy read, I think I read it in about 1.5hours, maybe less.  Gary is the creator of Wine Library TV a video blog on wine, and using blogs he grew his family liquor business from $4M to $50M in 8 years, not bad hey?    Gary is ALL about doing something you love, being passionate about it, and using that passion on the internet.  He is also BIG on hard work, as in really hard work, he talks in his book how when he first started his video blogs he would make the blog and then spend 8-9 hours A DAY commenting on other blogs, researching, tweeting and generally getting out there and \\"meeting the neighbours\\".  This I have to say is one of the main reasons I love his work.  The fact that he does work.  The way he writes in his book is exactly the same as the way he talks (I saw him in April in Sydney).  When I was at the conference in Sydney a lot of people kept asking him but how long do you spend on social media a day, how long do I need to spend, and similar questions.  He kept coming back to one point - I love it and therefore it doesn't feel like work.  This is what I love about him, as this Rabbit feels exactly the same, EXACTLY, if you enjoy it does it matter how long you spend doing it?    So in true form here are a few of my favourite bits from the book - they are all direct quotes,        * I know you were hoping for some links and resources, but if I'm going to teach you how to fish properly, I can't bait the hook for you.      * Your blog will be your main home, your central location with a no-exceptions open-door policy where anyone can find you.  It also serves as storage for all the content you will create, essentially building an archive where people can see how you and your business have evolved and expanded.      * The real beauty of Twitter and Facebook (and all the other social networking sites) is that they offer a massive opportunity for every entrepreneur and business to keep constant tabs on what their customers are thinking about them.      * If you are a video blogger you must have  TubeMogul account.  It's a website that allows you to upload your video once, then distributes it to countless video-sharing sites for free.      * If you want to dominate the social media game, all of your effort has to come from the heart      * assuming you're doing this right, you'll be bleeding out of your eyeballs at your computer [on hard work and time spent]      * No one makes a million dollars with minimal effort unless they win the lottery.      * If you contact me within a year of starting your business to complain that you haven't made the money you thought you would, you're not listening.  I said that you could make a ton of money being happy; I didn't say you could do it overnight.      * But creating your content is the easy part.  Of course your product should be as good as it can be, but it should also be the least time-consuming element of your whole endeavor.      * Care.    I think that from the extracts above you get the idea behind Gary and his book.  It is a quick easy read that you will want to come back to every time you need that kick up the bum to get you moving.    Until next week enjoy, have fun and get busy on your social networks.  If you have a book you'd like me to review please post it in the comments or on the Social Rabbit Facebook Page.    [...]
B003IPC5SO|4.0|Her best album since Fever, Aphrodite is pure lightweight, fluffy electropop. Get outta my way, is probably the album's highlight, but there are four or five other songs that are pretty good.  Kylie isn't pushing the musical envelope, but who cares! She's made a fun dance record. Turn up the volume and enjoy.
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|FlashForward is the best series on earth. ABC canceled it a couple months back. I bought this so I can watch it over and over. Even though I know the episode, It never gets old. Seriously, buy this DVD. It's great.
B0036EBARO|4.0|I find every Goldfrapp album (with the exception of Supernature)a little hard to digest at first, but over time the songs just seem to melt into you subconscious. Head First is no exception, let me state that I am generally not a  synth fan, so I was initially  put off by the Xanadu/electronica arrangements, but after a few accidental spins on my ipod, I can say that it works, and in the case of the track Alive, it works brilliantly.    So of course Head First is totally different from anything that Goldfrapp has done before(but that's a given), and  If I had to pick  one track to highlight, it would be Shiny and Warm...totally funky... love the beats, it just makes me want to dance everytime.     I am curious to see what musical direction they go next as they have mapped out a pretty intersting musical journey so far.    In a nutshell, it's a pretty good album,but judge for yourself.
B003A4IFDW|3.0|These are very slow, very loose bluesy adaptations that rarely improve on the originals.  Really slow.  So slow and lacking in melodic phrasing  that in many instances they obliterate the original song and are merely familiar lyrics recited to new, lugubrious arrangments.  If I were not looking for a phrase or two in the painfully slow \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me,\\"  I would not have guessed it was a song I had heard before.  Often, what she changes is the very thing that made a song great.   It's an accomplishment of sorts to take an incredibly catchy pop hit and make it different, but I think this goes too far.  Had these been the original performances, none of these songs would have been hits.  Other artists have done covers more successfully, e.g. Cat Power's [[ASIN:B00004NHDY Covers Record]] album, where the covers are great in their own right.  It's very disappointing, because some of Ms. Lavette's songs on other albums are among my all time favorites.
B002QW7ALM|3.0|I would give this well made sci-fi film 4 stars for its special effects but only 3 for its plot.  Although the makers wanted to create an original sci-fi film (which they did visually), this film just did not rate five stars as far as I was concerned.  It had great art work, very good make up, beautiful sets, and fantastic creature effects, but was just too gory and violent.<br /><br />This was an original film about a slow traveling generational star ship (i.e., travel times of hundreds of years) and an end of the world effort to settle on a new planet found to orbit a star 40 light years away from earth.  Great and an original idea for sci-fi film, but the plot was not much to speak of.  Although it was a new setting for sc-fi and employed amazing creature effects, the plot was sorely lacking.<br /><br />Visually it was as stunning as Alien, with sets almost as organic as Giger's work. In the end it turned into a very well made slasher movie similar to EVENT HORIZON. EVENT HORIZON, starring Sam Neil, was another sc-fi film which was really well done and incorporated many original ideas and great effects but needed someone to help out with a good plot besides violence and gore.
B002B3WEO4|5.0|My title says it all.  This album is great from start to finish.  Several of my favorite Petty songs are on this album.  I listen to his hits quite a bit but when I want a Petty album this is the one I choose.  One his least known great songs on here is \\"To Find a Friend.\\" Excellent.  This has it all.
0743289692|5.0|Ayaan's memoir is an amazing eye opening tale that is difficult to put down. Her writing is straightforward and honest.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Despite what his naysayers fume about, what's most apparent in this film is Moore's great love for this country and for democracy. His concerns that BIg Finance and corporatism have hijacked our democracy are well founded, (especially considering the Supreme Court's recent ruling allowing corporations with deep pockets to anonymously finance political campaigns without limits) Most Moore fans have probably already seen the flick and those who already hate him will never view it. Pity that, as this is a film for all americans who believe in and love democracy. For most viewers, the extras will be the reason to pick up this DVD. Honestly, most of the extra interviews/scenes are of a very high quality on par with the film, making this a richer, even more satisfying \\"Love Story\\" experience. Go for it!
B002TYZKIM|4.0|I bought this DVD used with no expectations.  It was like new.  The DVD was in excellent condition.  Thanks and I will be looking for you again.
B003BKF696|5.0|Hard to write something objective when you are so captivated by a record.  I deferred posting a review in case the album lost some of its appeal after repeated plays.  It did not!  To my taste, quite possibly the finest record issued from either side of the Atlantic for, well, a long, long time.  Brilliant stuff and it's good to see that The National are now getting the attention that they deserve.
B000093BDX|5.0|Love it!  I work on the Outer Banks and we play this CD in our store to get the customers in a good mood.  I'm very happy with the product and the customer service.
1849162743|5.0|Fast Friendly service. Wanted to finish this<br />series and it has not been circulated here yet.<br />Thanks so much!!!!
1439190275|5.0|This is the best and the easiest diet in the world providing you have your \\"food supplies\\" on hand. If you don't, you will falter and eat something else. The diet bars are excellent and the shakes are as well. You can eat steak, seafood and chicken, ect. Also, you get to eat your salad for the right amount of greens.<br /> I highly recommend this program to anyone who wants and needs to lose weight. It is a feel good program because you are not sluggish from carbohydrates. If you can adhere to the diet for the first 14 days which is easy to do, then you can introduce some other carbohydrates into the mix. If I try to diet with fruits and grains, I merely delay the weight loss and sometimes even gain weight. It is a journey not a destination which takes patience, reinforcement and self-talk.<br /> I eat this way all of the time and I feel that I am at my optimal weight.
B000VI04HK|1.0|Unless you enjoy hyper-kinetic cinematography with barely a recognizable frame, then I'd suggest you purchase the CD-only version - the music on this set is absolutely five star.  Only \\"Man on the Moon\\" (the last track) presents anything resembling the concert experience.  The \\"film\\" is just a good example of what happens when a film producer believes his/her ability in that art form translates to music - it doesn't.  If Mr. Stipe is so concerned about perfection in performance, then please let us see the performance as it was, so that we can make that decision ourselves.  An absolutely wonderful example of how this works would be My Morning Jacket's \\"Okonokos\\".  All the energies and emotions behind their performance is there for one to see and doubles the impact of the music.  The same goes for \\"At the Olympic\\" which is a pastiche of obscure black and white imagery.  Unless you think you'd enjoy pin hole camera shots from obscured angles, then I'd suggest you stick with the again five-star music and skip the version with the DVD.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I spotted  this pre-order and since this is my favorite Disney movie I was instantly interested.  Many studios have botched blu-ray releases pretty bad.   So I scrolled down to look at the comments of others.   This product will not be released until October 2010.   Instead of a discussion of the pros and cons of blu-ray I find 8-9 year old reviews of the DVD and totally inappropriate (for this product) reviews of Amazon Marketplace orders for the DVD.   All of this needs to be removed.    It is good to see that Disney is not only offering this fan favorite on blu-ray with DVD, but is including extras.  I give this 5 stars based on the writeup for the  3-disc blu-ray combo pack and my love of this movie.    I will update my review in October with an actual description of the product once I have it.
0785134352|3.0|Well, I haven't seen the movie yet, but I did finally get around to reading the book. It was okay. I mean, it was a total page-turner and I was engrossed by the story... I appreciated the depiction of the nerdy, slightly scummy, teenage protagonist who becomes a fanboy-gone-vigilante... He was an interesting character, and his voice as narrator was slightly new.     But the violence... Ah, the violence. Yes, yes, I do get that the whole point of this book is that it's a \\"what if superheroes were real?\\" story, but not a what-kind-of-sick-stuff-could-a-real-Superman-do \\"what if,\\" but rather how-messed-up-could-a-normal-person-who-played-Batman-get kinda story. Although the book is well-written, the blood and gore is gratuitous, and ultimately this is just another entry into a growing list of recently-produced violence-porn super-comics.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a growing trend, and while writers and readers may get tired of the taboo-breaking goriness, more likely than not they'll just get numbed-out and not care anymore -- the genre is, doubtless, here to stay.  I may read a couple of stories like this and still find it interesting, but I ain't gonna sign up for a steady diet of it. I don't think it's a healthy cultural trend. (Old Man Axton)
0060899220|5.0|This where it all started for Bourdain. Acerbic, witty and brutally honest. If you love his show \\"No Reservations\\", you'll love this book!
B00005JGAB|3.0|Best served in small doses of humble pop punk which can in fact regularly transcend their amateur-garage roots, the band's severe limitations sounded far less tolerable when enjoyed as a whole release.
0061120073|4.0|What a great book.  I enjoyed the character development, and the author definitely kept me interested.  Read this and become a fan also.
B000002MP2|3.0|3 1/2      Love or loathe one of the largest modern pop-punkers, Dookie was one major label step-up unworthy of dumping on.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used to be very athletic. Had four knee surgery's and am now trying to get back into exercising. It's hard for me to go to the gym because I feel so out of shape from where I used to be. This workout is perfect because it gets your heart-rate up and then Jillian switches up the exercises. I wasn't board and loved how quick but effective this DVD is.     It's a good purchase. I would recommend this dvd
B003RNZDKY|5.0|dope per usual. can't miss with this one, especially if you're a Roots fan... solid album
B000IOUCO2|5.0|I selected the vendor because of the high rating and the clearly stated but purchaser friendly return policy.
0981951244|5.0|It's always easy to talk the talk, but those who dare walking the walk are the ones who will eventually separate themselves from the masses and live a great life, a life of significance. Through his masterpiece \\"The Compound Effect\\", Darren Hardy has perfectly displayed the easy-to-follow principles that any human being can abide by in order to achieve that which they desire in life. I got the book and CD combo, read and listened to multiple times, and gave them away. I recommend you get yours and not keep the secret to yourself. As Zig would say \\"See You At The TOP!\\" ....
B000EQ46FA|5.0|excelent record with several classics synth pop songs, like \\"enjoy the silence\\", \\"personal jesus\\", \\"world in my eyes\\" and \\"policy of truth\\"...
0399156577|3.0|I adore Nora Roberts and really love her In Death series. I really just sorta liked this book, primarily for the reasons others have mentioned....way too much detailed explanations about dog training. Midway through the audio book, I finally got annoyed enough at the lengthy dog training explanations and just started skimming through it. One dog training scene with a problem dog last 15 minutes...15 audio book minutes... That's just ridiculous in my opinion. There are parts that are really funny but there's hardly any suspense and the ending is a complete letdown. If you love Nora Roberts, read this just because it's by her but wait for paper back or get it from the library. If you're looking for a good romantic suspense, read some of her past stuff like Public Secrets, Private Scandals, Genuine Lies, Divine Evil, etc. Those are WAAAAAY better.
1594488843|5.0|A must read if you are responsible for others in a business environment. 20 years in corporate and I've missed the target. Drive opened up my eyes to a new way of encouraging and encountering others. Thank you Daniel Pink.
B00005LIN0|5.0|This is a recording anybody who likes Gershwin's Porgy And Bess could not do without. It is the only full original recording of the opera as far as I know, and in my opinion the musical performance and the acting are both really outstanding. I'm happy that I've found this DVD - 100 % recommended!
B002ZG98LO|4.0|It has taken a string of awful sequels for someone such as Nimrod Antal to step up and take the Predator franchise back to its roots of gore, suspense and plain fear, but does it do these things well? \\"Predators\\" sets it story deep within the nostalgia of fans with a jungle setting similar to the original. We are introduced to an unconscious Royce, a hardened, ex-military mercenary played by Adrien Brody, free-falling from the sky over the jungle. After a warm welcome from fellow drop ins, the newly formed team of eight begin to make sense of their surroundings.      \\"Predators\\" builds the tension between the characters similarly to that of the original with fear and uncertainty clouding their minds. The eerie-ness and unfamiliarity of the environment and it's contents are also set just as in the first film. The building of this tension plays out smoothly and doesn't rush itself to get to it's point (the whole alien planet/we are being hunted/\\"If it bleeds, it can be killed\\" deal) Not until the end of the film does it feel rushed and out of balance with the beginning and midpoint. The chemistry between the characters doesn't bore at all, even with their backgrounds as \\"the most dangerous killers on Earth\\" the flow of dialect and development with each character is enough to hold the viewer's interest and move the story along realistic grounds. A very interesting note is how the characters explain their backgrounds and solidify their characters through the traps set within the film (theirs and others.) There are also many specific pieces paying homage to the original, such as the explanation of the Hunters and a few of the battle sequences.     Speaking very shortly about the gore, it plays its part in solidifying the harsh settings the characters are placed in and the brutality of the creatures they are faced against, (Most notably the campsite of the Predators and what every fan wanted to see, the taking of the \\"trophies.\\") unlike the past two sequels (*shudders*) where the first was devoid of nearly any gore and the second making it seem laughable and rendering it useless.     I have only two gripes about the film, one being the pacing near the end, (as mentioned earlier) after meeting with another survivor named Nolan (Laurence Fishburne) and the events leading to another encounter with the Predator creatures, the remaining survivors start to die off quite fast. Even though the plan made before the set chase is clear, I felt that the suspense kind of died after that leaving only one minor twist afterwards. Oh and Topher Grace (I think you will see him mentioned in many reviews to come for the movie) Didn't leave a strong enough impression. Without giving too much away about him, I believe that his character's motives could have been fleshed out a little better than the film made them.     Bottom line, \\"Predators\\" plants its feet in the ground and exclaims with confidence that \\"this is more than a sequel, it's a return to form.\\" and a return very well needed. Even with it's numerous similarities, \\"Predators\\" is able to stand on it's own with a strong cast and a smooth mix of violence, gore, charisma and chemistry and screams possibilities of sequels to come.
B000002J0B|5.0|An album that shows the musical talent of Led Zep rather than how hard it could rock out.  A must have from when I was a teen....
B001CWOCUO|5.0|The minute I saw that there was a concert performance of Rihanna's on dvd/blu-ray, I ordered it. I was a bit worried before watching it though, after seeing the track list- it doesn't have all of my favorites, and it has two songs of hers that I don't care for. But you know what? The rad-ness of this concert shot down all my worries, because what's not here doesn't matter, and what I don't like is now likable thanks to this concert. Here's the track list:    Introduction, Pon De Replay, Break It Off, Let Me, Rehab, Breakin' Dishes, Is This Love (Bob Marley cover), Kisses Don't Lie, Scratch, SOS, Good Girl Gone Bad, Hate That I Love You, Unfaithful, Sell Me Candy, DJ Kevmo/Don't Stop the Music, Push up on Me, Shut Up and Drive, Question Existing, Umbrella    I'll tell you right now- the majority of the tracks on here are given a rock/metal sound. The hip hop's still there, but the main focus is on electric guitar riffs and chords, and to tell you the truth, I really dig it. As much as I love the original tracks from her albums, the guitar gives them a fresh sound, and it's like you're hearing them for the first time all over again. Another surprise that shocked me was that Rihanna actually -sang- her songs rather than her half-talk half-sing that she usually does. It was great hearing her belt out some of the lyrics, and having some emotion and energy while moving around on stage. The girl can dance, and she keeps up with her dancers perfectly. There's really nothing bad I can say at all regarding the performance. Camera cuts didn't bother me for a change because they always go to a good angle, or focus on the band, or some of the pyro and special effects. This is a hell of a concert, and I can only imagine being there to see it live. The crowd is absolutely nuts, and you can't blame them.    Since I don't usually buy concert performances, I don't know what more there is to say. Fans of Rihanna will most likely enjoy the show, but I know some people were turned off by the guitar-driven music. My only complaint is a small one, and it has nothing to do with Rihanna, but with how many cuts there are to the crowd. It's good to show the crowd enjoying themselves, but there are A LOT of crowd shots, to the point where I was wishing they'd cut half of it so we could get more footage of Rihanna and the band. Especially when she does her wardrobe change into the classy dress that shows off those Chun-Li legs of hers. Good god, I stopped eating and my jaw dropped as soon as she walked out in that lil' number...    The video and audio quality of the blu-ray are flawless. If you have a 1080p/i tv, THIS is the music blu-ray to show it off with. Everything is sharp, and you could probably count every single spark from the stage effects if you wanted to. And if you've got a nice audio setup, again, this will give your speakers a nice workout. Heck, maybe you should get a home theater system just for this!    The special features are sparse though- there's just a short documentary about Rihanna going on tour with short interviews with her friends and crew. It's nothing special, but she explains why she performs one of her songs, and they also go into how Rihanna's a prankster, and it's better for her buddies to not mess with her. Watch your shoes if you play a prank on Rihanna.    While I would've liked her to sing Disturbia and a few other songs, I'm very happy with what's here, and hope that Rihanna puts out another performance like this on blu-ray soon. If you're a big fan of the queen of pop, buy this right now!
B000026LE3|4.0|Good album - not great but if you a a pink fan you should have this one.  Let's face it you should have them all.
B002QUPWZU|5.0|This is by far one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's books that I have seen. The characaters certainly bring the haunting book to life in a way that makes you want to go back and read the book all over again.<br /><br />Kathy Bates is superb in this role that shows just how devoted some readers and fans can be---and what they will do to get just the ending they want.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|See my original review below this updated one:  New Review (1 star)  -----------------------------------  Bought this at the end of June 2010, and this thing just completely went out on me at the end of November... 5 months.  C'mon Turtle Beach, you guys used to have a quality name.  I bought these because my dependable, $80 Sennheiser HD 280 Pro's headband broke after several years (5, 8, 10 years? can't remember, it was a long time though), sound was still perfect!!!  I figured if I was going to get another set of headphones, I may as well get some that would work on PC, PS3, and 360, and include a built-in mic... big mistake.    I should have known these would be junk as soon as I got them out of their case.  The belt clip just disintegrated as soon as I depressed it.  Meh, no big deal, it's a belt clip, I'm not going jogging with them.  Then, also the same day I got them, noticed sound would cut out on one side.  It seemed to go away though, so I figured, maybe my stereo extension cable is going bad (happens).  5 months later, the problem is back, permanently.  I did several tests to isolate the problem.  Changed stereo cables, hooked the headset directly up to my receiver, hooked it directly up to my PC through usb cable, sound was still out, so it was the wiring/circuitry.  Add to that the dye they used on the earphones coming off on your face, and the absurd and ever present hiss in these things, and you have a cruddy yet expensive headset.    I have a friend who bought a pair of X11's and he says they work great... but he treats them with tender love and care (probably caresses them at night or sings to them... \\"daddy loves you\\").  I don't handle my headphones with tweezers, but I don't pound on them either.  I consider it normal use to toss them aside from a height of several inches onto a soft surface, without needing to worry about cheap wiring coming loose.  My HD 280 Pros never had a problem, and the headband issue was well-known, and didn't affect thecircuitry or wiring quality... because Sennheiser apparently actually cares about that sort of quality, even when they make lower-cost items.  If they have to cut, they'll do it in non-essential areas first.  Apparently not Turtle Beach though.    So, I got some Gorilla Glue, some electric tape, fixed up my 280's headband, and I could care less how they look because they're STILL comfortable and STILL work perfectly!  My advice, do your homework, save your money, buy a quality set of headphones (I recommend Sennheiser, perhaps even a step up from the 280's just because of the headband, but there's plenty of info out there on other quality brands), and if you need a mic for game chat, consider buying a separate one.  You can buy a very inexpensive and small USB sound card that will allow you to use the mic on PS3, and on the 360 there's the SteelSeries Spectrum AudioMixer that allows you to use regular headphones and mic together.    PX21 = Please eXcuse our cheapness, we're looking at high profit margins because these headphones only cost $21 to make...    Pssh, that's probably generous.  You've been warned.    Original Review (3 stars)  -----------------------------------  First thing out of the box, the belt clip on the volume module breaks off after I push on it one time.  + Constant hissing that's bearable, and once you start up a game + chat session your brain isn't really focusing on it (lol game/chat sound distracts you I guess); anywhere there's silence you'll hear significant hissing, though.  = Cheaply made, but it's... okay for something that works on PS3, 360, and PC, has nice Bass + control, stereo expander, mute for mic, chat volume control, game volume control.  Overall it's okay.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was the first Jillian DVD that I purchased (I must confess, I was always the 'jane fonda' type girl who was afraid to work out with weights too much!) and i should say it has changed my outlook on a 'workout'.<br />This DVD consists of three workouts of 20 mins each-wchih suits me perfectly-being a working mom. The beginner level are do-able on first go, but the advanced versions are really a change. I alternate between all three levels,so that I dont get bored -but every muscle feels worked out when i'm done. Its great worth for the money paid!
B003U21TBO|5.0|My wife is the one in the house who watches all of the episodes of Doctor Who.  I have sat through a couple of the episodes, but I really could not get into the series until season 5 came out.  The writing of this season is superbly done, and very witty.  Matt Smith plays the doctor who appears (at least to me) to have some sort of ADHD.  I am waiting eagerly for the next episode, and have even started watching Doctor Who from earlier season, to include David and Chris, but this is by far my favorite season.

0785134352|5.0|I will start by saying Wanted is my favorite comic of all time and so when I saw the movie I was beyond disappointed. So what made me want to read Kick-Ass was after I saw the trailer for the movie which looked amazing, I new the comic had to be even better. All I can really say is that this is up there in my top books I've read and Kick-Ass is definitely worth the purchase especially if you liked the movie. Both are very true to one another, but have enough differences that it is worth reading the book and watching the movie. Mark Millar is awesome.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Millenium trilogy (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who played with Fire and The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's nest) is the best thriller that has come along in a very long time. Its fast paced, readers get hooked into the story and are seduced by its main charachters and will never forget and remain intrigued for a long time with Lizbeth Salander, the very dark and heroine at the ceneter of it all.<br />For those who have not read any of the the three books of this trilogy I don't want to give away anything in order not to ruin their pleasure from reading these books. Its enough to say that The Girl who kicked the Honet's Nest  reaches deeper into the personality and life of Lizbeth Salander and rounds very well the storyline of the three books.<br />The only con I can find is that Stieg larsson has passed away and after reading his triology you are left craving for more from that great author.

B002VKE0XA|3.0|Ever since Paranormal Activity came out on Blu Ray back in December 2009 it has been in my Netflix queue. Netflix kept telling me that there was a \\"long wait\\" for this movie that was only getting average at best reviews. So everybody wants to see it, but it is being reviewed poorly? It must be better than everyone is saying, right? Maybe people are writing bad reviews because it really scared them and they don't want to admit it?<br /><br />Well it finally arrived at my house this week, and after watching I have to join the average at best chorus. It's one of those \\"found footage handheld camera movies\\" that's actually pretty effective for its genre. There are some genuinely creepy moments and if you watch it alone late at night it's even more effective. But overall I thought it was unrealistic and too long even though the theatrical version comes in at under 90 minutes.<br /><br />I think that it was Eddie Murphy in one of his early comedy routines that mocked the family in The Amityville Horror for staying in the house even though at one point in that movie a message from beyond cries out \\"GET OUT\\". A smart family would indeed get out! Well it's kinda the same in Paranormal Activity, except the concept is that the person is haunted versus the house. Okay...so GET OUT...of the relationship then!<br /><br />The biggest problem with Paranormal Activity is that it should have been a half hour long, but unfortunately the [[ASIN:B000E1MXWS Tales from the Crypt-esque]] format for that doesn't really exist at the moment. But, kudos to first time Director Oren Peli for making a reported 200 million bucks on a reported 15 grand investment.<br /><br />The movie has an R rating and I'm not sure why; there was really no gore and if there were bad words I don't recall anything above a PG-13 level. I understand that one of the alternate endings is a bit more gruesome than the theatrical version, so maybe that's it (I only watched the theatrical version).<br /><br />No need to buy this movie. And if you're still waiting for Paranormal Activity from Netflix, unless you have nothing better, take it out of your queue and wait for cable. One thing's for sure, I won't have Paranormal Activity 2 on my to-do list.ng for Paranormal Activity from Netflix, unless you have nothing better, take it out of your queue and wait for cable.

0307454541|5.0|(Originally published at Basil & Spice)<br /><br />OK--Here's the real deal.<br /><br />In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the late Swedish journalist Stieg Larsson delivered the literary equivalent of a major league double-play. Not only did he craft a compelling, cold-case mystery yarn in the tradition of Sherlock Holmes, but he also created two highly intriguing characters to drive the action and endure the suspense. This book ranks as a classic mystery told in a modern voice with substantial development of both plot and character.<br /><br />Although first published in Sweden in 2004, Girl has floated around long enough to have become an international sensation, so any followers of literary trends should become acquainted with this first installment of what Stephen King calls the Millennium Trilogy. This month marks the DVD release of the Swedish film version of [[ASIN:B003FBNJ4U The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo]], attracting an A-minus rating from Entertainment Weekly magazine.  And US producers aren't far behind, as they sift through a list of acting candidates that ranges from Brad Pitt to Scarlett Johansson to play lead characters Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander when an American version emerges in the next couple of years. So there is plenty of time to jump on the bandwagon.<br /><br />The true story behind the book(s) and the movie(s) sounds equally tantalizing after the untimely death of Larsson at age 50 and the rights dispute simmering between his longtime live-in girlfriend and his brothers. Larsson was another one of those late-blooming authors who decided to pursue a passion of crime-mystery writing after a successful career as the editor of a magazine that focused on exposing neo-Nazis in Sweden.  With Girl published nine months after his death, Larsson didn't even live long enough to see his trilogy top the best seller lists and earn lucrative movie deals.<br /><br />In Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, Lisbeth Salander is the girl with the dragon tattoo--a 25-year-old computer hacker adept at digging up the most closely held secrets while harboring some troubling secrets of her own.  In the opening volume, she allies with the 40-something Blomkvist, who has just been convicted of libel for an untrue story written for his Millennium magazine exposing a Swedish industrialist. Retained to solve a 40-year-old mystery of a missing teen, they stumble across a serial killer saga that spans decades and ultimately leads to redemption for Blomkvist.  Along the way, Larsson has liberally peppered his story with enough sex, humor and moral dilemma to serve up a thoroughly entertaining literary meal.<br /><br />The only thing missing is more exposure to Blomkvist and Salander. But wait, what's next? Here comes [[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)]]and [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]] to fill out the card.

0810988232|4.0|Why would you need another Faery oracle deck from Brian Froud after Faery Oracle? Well I was just curious enough to see. I bought this deck for my best fae friend for her 50th birthday, and it was on our faery altar shortly after midnight!    What we love are the \\"inside jokes\\" of this deck, which communicates directly with Faery Oracle. Personages from Faery Oracle make cameo appearances in Heart of Faery to remind us that they are not outdated, but are available to inform the reader.    All around, I would say that Heart of Faery and its new informers are more user friendly than Faery Oracle. Think of it as a prequel. When I get my own copy, and that's a when and not an if, my plan is to shuffle the two decks together to create a merrie faerie mayhem!
B0014DFCMS|2.0|Back in 08, when the movie came out on DVD, there was a huge buzz about it winning best screenplay and, so I decided I should check it out.<br /><br />The movie is about a 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff. I'm not kidding. I'm serious. Throughout the movie I tried to pretend that name wasn't the most pretentious female protagonist name I've ever heard but I failed. She talks like a real smartass and acts all cocky to people. She's 16 and is in love with Paulie Bleeker (again, another pretentious \\"indie\\" name). One day she finds out that she got pregnant from a time when she and Paulie had sex. She considers having an abortion, but after being forced to face the fact that once you make a decision it stays with you forever, she decides to come out about her pregnancy to her parents and give it up for adoption. She finds one family in a classified ad who has an infertile mother and goes to get to know them. She takes a keen kinship to the husband, who loves indie music and cinema, including one situation where they watch the 70s cheese horror flick \\"The Wizard of Gore\\". Then a bunch of drama and depressing indie pretentiousness ensues and... I... just... don't... freaking... care. The end.<br /><br />I didn't HATE this film. Some lines were funny and I liked some of the cast, including the guy who played Jameson from Spider Man, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman, who of course charms in each role. One particularly powerful scene was when Juno has an emotional breakdown in the van- Finally she acts instead of trying to be a teenager and spewing cocky words.<br /><br />To say the characters are cardboard is an understatement- they're TISSUE PAPER THIN. Juno is not likable at all. Why should I sympathize for her? She's just a smartassed cocky borderlining-on-bitch who has absolutely no reason to be in the story other than the fact that she's the protagonist and she's pregnant. And her constant pop culture references were don't help either. Paulie I have no respect for- come on, getting a girl knocked up before she's even old enough to drive has no respectability in it, and the movie tries to make me care about him by making him all \\"cute\\" and \\"awkward\\" but come on. Also, this film in a way almost glamorizes teen pregnancy- Their parents are cool with her being pregnant AT 16 (I've known people in this situation and trust me, their parents were the exact opposite of that). There's much more but it would be too long to list. Oh and for the record, I don't think I've EVER heard anyone say \\"Pork swords\\".<br /><br />I don't even think creepy looking assassins with stupid haircuts and silenced shotguns could have saved this film. It's not terrible but I honestly don't get why it's so praised.l knocked up before she's even old enough to drive has no respectability in it, and the movie tries to make me care about him by making him all \\"cute\\" and \\"awkward\\" but come on.

0143115723|5.0|This book is brilliant!!! It explains why Nelson Mandela is such an inspiration for the human race, and it does it in a factual, honest way that includes the bigger perspective, in other words, its not a personal account of Nelson's life, rather, its a personal account of the merging of Nelson's life and South Africa's life. It is BRILLIANT!!!
1441850953|5.0|I thought this book had a lot of action and so much suspense that it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  If you aren't fulfilled in the beginning, just keep on reading because it gets a lot better when they start using magic.  I thought that Red Pyramid was even better than The Lightning Thief or any of the books in the Percy Jackson series.  I looked at the other reviews on this book and I think this book deserves a five star rating.

After seeing such an incredible difference in other BR-over-DVD movies, I was expecting the same here. Poop! What's worse, I just happened to see the review that mentioned how this transfer is a lot better than the House of Flying Daggers one -- which I also bought and haven't seen yet.  I love wasting money replacing movies I already have with movies that aren't any better........

I think this would make a perfect gift for a family or a child who has this story to tell.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Regarding the DVD: there are virtually no extras.    Misfortune and malevolence plague the German village of Eichwald. Its inhabitants are more concerned with local vandalism, maimings, and deaths than the impending Great War. Yet events in the town foreshadow an even deadlier war. Designed to represent innocence, the titular white ribbon actually serves as a punishment for naughty children and raises questions about guilt, pretense, and purity. In The White Ribbon, director Michael Haneke has created a film whose horrors are enveloped in silence and uncertainty, provoking in viewers both thought and terror.    The black and white cinematography conveys the era's severity and façade of simplicity. There is no music to direct or alleviate tension. Instead, long, sometimes self-conscious, shots develop a sense of dread until evil appears to inhabit every scene. Acting, from the youngest child to the oldest patriarch, is outstanding.    Through the social structures of a claustrophobic town, The White Ribbon examines death, persecution, religion, and vengeance. These far-reaching themes make Eichwald eerily universal.    At the conclusion of the showing I attended, a man whispered, \\"My God, what a movie.\\" Grateful for a chance to relieve tension, and perhaps in unspoken accord with the speaker, the audience burst into laughter. Still, an unsettling feeling lingered. And lingered.

B002ZG98LO|4.0|Predators has been one of my most anticipated films of the year ever since the trailer debuted. The trailer gave off the impression that the film had the same atmosphere as the original, but modernized with a new cast and contained more than one Predator. While the Alien Vs Predator films were either terrible or left a lot to be desired, could a new Predator film get everything back on track? I'm delighted to say yes. That's exactly the case.<br /><br />The cast seems bizarre on paper; there's that guy who had sex with a creature that contained spliced human and animal DNA (Adrien Brody), Eric Forman from That 70's Show (Topher Grace), that girl who was mostly artificial organs in Repo Men (Alice Braga), that guy who always manages to play a bad ass Mexican and appears in most Robert Rodriguez films (Danny Trejo), Morpheus from The Matrix (Laurence Fishburne), and Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) among many others. The dynamic cast is actually one of the most absorbing factors of the film. Topher Grace adds that little bit of humor in most of the screen time he has and his character ventures off into territory you may not be expecting. \\"Justified\\"'s Walton Goggins steals quite a few humorous lines, as well. Royce (Brody) and Isabelle (Braga) would probably be pretty dull if it wasn't for the chemistry the two develop the longer they're around each other. Laurence Fishburne's introduction scene alone is arguably more bad ass than anything he did in The Matrix. The cast really makes this film work; plain and simple.<br /><br />Returning to the jungle was another great move. It brings back the nostalgic factor of the first film that everyone seems to love. The fact that they referenced the events in the original was a nice touch, as well. After giving the impression that it was a reboot, Predators is apparently meant to be a sequel to the first two Predator films. It's still good to know that at least all of this is taking place in the same universe. The other thing that really makes this film fantastic other than the cast are the Predators themselves. They all look rather brilliant. While there are \\"smaller\\" Predators that look incredibly similar to the original design, there are others that are larger, stronger, and have slightly different weaponry or tracking devices. The film doesn't shy away from blood and gore either, which I highly approve of. When a film like this uses the R-rating to its advantage, it just gives me goosebumps.<br /><br />The one thing that can really be nitpicked is the ending since the film just kind of stops and leaves way too much room for a sequel. Oddly enough though, it's still strangely satisfying but that could be due to the rest of the film being so superb.<br /><br />Predators delivers one of the most solid and satisfying sequels to date. The visual and make-up effects are top notch, the strong cast seems to play off one another and is entertaining to watch, and the film manages to pay just enough homage to the original film while venturing off into its own territory. Predators should please any fan of the franchise or anyone who enjoys action, sci-fi, thriller, or even horror films. If you've been anticipating this film as much as I have and it didn't disappoint me, then you have nothing to lose.s film fantastic other than the cast are the Predators themselves.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|You know, it's obvious that Troy is not entirely faithful to Homer's The Iliad. But that's not what's bad about the movie (I mean, come on. It's a fact that not every movie is true to the books they're based on). No, the biggest flaws in the movie are the casting choices. The supporting cast is really good, and Peter O'Toole is typically brilliant. However, the five major leads of the film (Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Rose Byrne, and Diane Kruger) are badly miscast. None of them fit their parts (even Pitt): they look unconvincing and undistinguished. And Brad Pitt is a pretty cool guy, but seriously, how can ANYONE picture him as Achilles? Good news, however. The look of the film is a treat. The sets look marvelous, the battle scenes are well-staged, and the CGI effects actually look realistic.<br /><br />I'm kind of mixed about this film. I dislike the main performances and the music. But at the same time, I like everything else in the film. I'll give this a C+, because I don't exactly dislike the entire film. I just wish they chose some better actors for the main characters.<br /><br />Grade: C+

014241493X|5.0|I read this book in one sitting.  John Green left me speechless just as he did with Looking for Alaska.  Margo Roth Spiegelman is just as quirky and admirable as Alaska, and I love that.  John can really take a character and make him or her into something that you respect, into someone that you wish you were more like.  I honestly felt like I was Quentin (the main character) for the majority of the book, looking for clues and seeing what Margo would do next.       This book will not leave you uninterested and bored.  John Green has such a way with words.  His words leave you to imagine what is going on and also to try to work out the puzzle in your head.  The development of his characters is beyond that of a normal teen novel, and I think that his work really reflects that.  Paper Towns is by far one of my favorite books, and I know that it's one that I'll read over and over again.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|All the negative comments from previous reviewers stand. What I am adding is for any  people like me, who saves all video to a hard drive. BBC has made a serious mistake by encoding this new Life series using VC1, or rather WVC1, a modified codec that only Windows uses. That said, the obvious effect when played back by any common Bluray player is Oprah's voice is drown out in the background music, making it impossible to play it softly at night.  Second and deadly flawed is there's no software media player currently available that would play this nearly abandoned VC1 format, not even MS Windows Media Player. That's it.  They goofed up seriously. The previous series from BBC that I own including Planet Earth were encoded by H.264 that turn out to be beautiful and current and relevant. I wonder why they changed it?  By the way, I am not a big fan of D. Attenborough. I think S. Weaver does the best job. Again, BBC fired her- another big mess!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|As always, BBC demonstrates their talent and dedication to do justice to the beauty of nature and its inner workings. I highly recommend this series to go along with the Planet Earth Blue Ray disks. And please, PLEASE, DO NOT be fooled by the so called \\"American\\" version of this fantastic series which is narrated by Oprah, yes, Oprah. An individual must be entirely deprived of common sense to chose Oprah's voice over the brilliant David Attenborough.
B002BWP4A6|1.0|Ok, the cinematography is great, the acting is good, and yes, we get the symbolism.  But beyond that, this movie is 140 minutes of painfully slow shallow plot.  The movie bares not the slightest resemblance to a Twilight Zone episode (as some have claimed), if for no other reason than the story has no recognizable ending.  The movie does a haphazard job of \\"weaving\\" a suspenseful story line without giving the viewer any reward for his/her patience.      Seriously, just awful.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|At first, I wasn't sure what to make of some of these songs. I really enjoyed some of the songs on [[ASIN:B000PTYPAC Riot]] but when comparing them to the songs on [[ASIN:B002FRNCG0 Brand New Eyes]], the songs didn't have that same catchiness, overall. HOWEVER, that might be the best part of this album. It has DEPTH.<br /><br />And to say there are NO catchy songs on this CD is not true at all. Why you might ask? Because I've had this CD for a week, and I'm already singing along to some of the non-singles. It's my best purchase I've made this month so far. Not that you should compare the two, but I also bought Lady Gaga's [[ASIN:B001GM28HO The Fame]] which is good in its own right, but not as good as Paramore's third entry.<br /><br />The CD itself kinda has a theme. And that's losing a bandmate and even almost breaking up over it. But they chose to persevere. Us fans are really glad too! I'd rather not live in a world without Paramore. Hayley is a decent vocalist and an awesome personality to have around, celebrity-wise. So yeah. Kudos to her! And big ups to the rest of the band too for making this CD sound great.<br /><br />Songs on the CD are as follows:<br />1. CAREFUL<br />2. IGNORANCE<br />3. PLAYING GOD<br />4. BRICK BY BORING BRICK<br />5. TURN IT OFF<br />6. THE ONLY EXCEPTION<br />7. FEELING SORRY<br />8. LOOKING UP<br />9. WHERE THE LINES OVERLAP<br />10. MISGUIDED GHOSTS<br />11. ALL I WANTED<br /><br />My favorites in order are probably 'Misguided Ghosts' (heartbreaking and honest), 'Turn It Off' (fun in a twisted, almost dark kinda way), 'All I Wanted' (really easy to listen to) & 'Feeling Sorry' (grew on me. really upbeat and cool).<br /><br />The two tracks that skate on the filler side are 'Looking Up' and 'Where The Lines Overlap'. They are still decent tracks, but they aren't great. And they put them right after one another. :-/<br /><br />Anyway, great CD. I don't care what anyone else says. Yes, it's not as immediately catchy and flamboyant as [[ASIN:B000PTYPAC Riot]] is but it is probably the better CD. It is very, very consistent and I don't regret buying it for a second.

B003GDYN24|1.0|First let me say it pains me to write this review, because i've always supported Kelis in all her work, but i have to be honest. This album is the worst album ever released by her. The only song worth listening to is \\"You Make Me High (forth of july)\\", the rest is absolute garbage. Her old no nonsense style exuded confidence and fire, it expressed who she was and her indeviduality. This album was just her repeating the same words over and over again with \\"sci-fi\\" sounds in the background. And the lyrics, dont get me started, I think a 5th grader could have wrote a better song. And for a long awaited come back album, I must say only 9 songs? Thats not even a full album. This new direction is more European, she is not known for Techno in the U.S. Her new look i love, but this new sound doesn't make her seem like she can sing. I puchased it the day it came out, and eagerly listend to it, and it was agoney. I wanted my money back, it was so dissapointing. Buy this if you feel you must own everything Kelis makes, but dont expect anything special.
0671015206|4.0|This book is must read for those who want to be a millionaire. I am 21 years old in college. I know this is a book generally for people who are over 30. But seriously if you're looking to read books to expand your financial literacy and get a better understanding how millionaires become millionaires. This is it. In the beginning it gets really slow because of all the research data they did.. But in the middle of the book, i laughed out loud reading this because this book was saying true stuff and i learned some of the important things of what it takes to become a millionaire.. Not only it talks about money.. It talks about the discipline, desire and what it takes to become a millionaire.. I give it a 4.

The next, \\"The girl Who Played with Fire\\" keeps you going.  Now I am on the last,  \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's  Nest\\" and I don't want it to end.  Such a shame the author died before seeing his books becoming such a success.

0061537969|3.0|2 words that describe the book: Dog's perspective<br /><br />3 settings where it took place or characters you met:<br /><br />* Setting: Seattle, Washington, modern times<br /><br />* Enzo is a human soul trapped in a dog's body ... or so he likes to believe. The entire book is narrated by Enzo, who worships his master Denny. Enzo tells his life story from the day Denny got him at the puppy farm until the day his soul is released to run until he is reborn. As Enzo tells his story, we also learn the story of Denny.<br /><br />* Denny is Enzo's owner. He is also a race car driver, who imparts his love of racing to Enzo. (Just a heads-up: There is a lot of racing information in the book. I thought it was handled well and it didn't bother me, but I could see that it might be a turnoff to some readers.) At first, it is only Denny and Enzo. Then, one day, Denny brings home a woman named Eve. Enzo is initially very jealous of Eve, and it takes them some time to become friends. However, Enzo and Eve's friendship deepens with the arrival of Zoe, Denny and Eve's daughter. However, long before anyone else knows, Enzo's keen sense of smell tells him that something is very wrong with Eve. As Eve's health worsens, things take a tragic turn for the little family, and Denny faces one tragedy after another. Yet Denny never gives up fighting, and Enzo is with him every step of the way--a favor that Denny repays when Enzo nears the end of his life.<br /><br />4 Things you liked and/or disliked about it:<br /><br />* I liked how Stein made Enzo the dog a sympathetic and charming narrator. It is a tricky thing to write from the point of view of an animal, and I think Stein managed to pull it off for the most part. By making Enzo talk about his feeling like a man trapped in a dog's body, it becomes easier for the reader to accept Enzo's narration and intelligence. Yet the best parts of the book, for me, was when Enzo was purely dog. Enzo himself questions his own disdain of his dog nature as he lies on his deathbed:<br /><br />  And I wonder: Have I squandered my dogness? Have I forsaken my nature for my desires? Have I made a mistake by anticipating my future and shunning my present?<br /><br />  Perhaps I have. An embarrassing deathbed regret. Silly stuff.<br /><br />* At the same time, I disliked how Stein made Enzo seem \\"too\\" human. Stein is really telling the story of what happens to Denny, and Enzo (although a compelling narrator) seems a bit unrealistic as a narrator in many ways. When I first heard about this book, I was curious to see how a book written from a dog's perspective would read. Quite a few years ago, I read a wonderful short story by Dave Eggers called After I Was Thrown in the River and Before I Drowned (click on the link for the full story!), which was also written from a dog's perspective. To me, the Eggers's story is much more \\"true\\" to how I think I a dog would tell a story. (But what do I know? I'm not a dog.) Yet I could see that Stein would have a difficult time writing an entire NOVEL from the point of view of a dog if he didn't somehow make the dog more human than dog.<br /><br />* I disliked how much tragedy Stein piles onto Denny. It seemed melodramatic and overdone. It struck me that much of what happens to Denny would probably not hold water from a legal perspective. And I didn't buy into the story line with the young relative Annika either. This seemed more like a ploy to be able to extricate Denny from the legal problems with his in-laws. In some ways, Denny's story seemed overly plotted to me.<br /><br />* I liked the ending of the book. After a pretty sad last chapter, it was nice to be able to end the book on a high note with the epilogue. Although it is foreshadowed a few times in the book, I rather enjoyed the little twist at the end.<br /><br />5 Stars or less for your rating?<br /><br />I'm giving the book 3.5 stars. I know this book was wildly popular with many readers, and I can see the attraction. I'msure many dog lovers project the personalities of their beloved pets onto Enzo, and I admire Stein for attempting to write an entire novel from a dog's point of view. Although I think he basically succeeds, I did think the book was overly plotted and melodramatic. In some ways, I think having a dog narrator covers up a story that might not have stood well on its own. As you can probably tell, I'm not in love with the book, but I didn't hate it either. I think it is worth reading at some point, and probably a must read for dog lovers (though have your tissues ready).for attempting to write an entire novel from a dog's point of view.

B003IPC5SO|5.0|OMG! This album is one of her best. Im a bigger Kylie fan, and I love her music. This album fits the theme she is going for, and the songs. I love 9 songs on the album and thats a lot considering most albums i by I only like 2 or 3. This album is so upbeat and inspirational. I listen to the entire thing and couldn't stop dancing. I hope she makes a music video for \\"Everything is Beautiful\\" All the songs are so sexy and smooth. I listen to it to relax, and work out. Kylie always manages to bring you into her world with her music. She is inovative and she knows how to stay true to her self in her style and music. I hope she has another concert tour for this album. I loved it, worth every penny spent. If your a Kylie Fan (like me) buy it, you will not be dissapointed, if your not a fan but want to give pop/dance music a try, start with this album.
0393072231|5.0|This is a well written book by an author with an engaging writing style, some detailed knowledge of the subject matter, and an ability to reduce a complex subject to lucid explanations.  I'd highly recommend it.  Although the book is not political it may provoke some questions regarding the relationship of the financial sector to government and to wonder who has the most influence, voters or corporate interests.

0385737424|5.0|This moving and intelligent book for older children is set in the 1970's and can be enjoyed by adults as well. It has so many interesting elements, all bound together in a way that is satisfying and logical.    I especially enjoyed the tie-in with Madeleine L'Engle's classic A Wrinkle In Time, one of my all-time favorites (even if this book does point out an error in the time travel aspect of it.) It is a major thread that runs consistently throughout the story.    There's also a mysterious, crazy, homeless old man; the baffling end of a lifelong friendship; the plight of latchkey children; bullying, snobbishness, and cliques among schoolkids; living with a disability; a mystery; a mom's appearance on the $20,000 Pyramid game show; dealing with the possibility of a new stepfather; and more. Along the way, the main character learns some important life lessons, especially not to judge other people because things may not always be the way they appear.    The chapters are named as if they were categories in the $20,000 Pyramid: Things That Fall Apart, Things That Are Small, etc. - delightfully clever!    When You Reach Me deserves the Newbery Award Medal that it won this year (2010) for Best Children's Book.    (199 pages)

B0027JTI4Q|5.0|Just two days ago I borrowed \\"Skipping Christmas\\" by John Grisham from a stack of books bought by my best friend. I confess to never having read or been interested in a courtroom drama by Grisham, or the harsh realities that would assail my senses when reading it. So I halfway put the book back down. But the wintery holiday cover looked inviting and the summary on the inside cover promised hilarious entertainment. I read it in two sittings. I knew Grisham was good, but this book was genius. I laughed outloud, commiserated and identified with the characters and cried big tears at several points.<br />All the while, I'm thinking, \\"this should be a movie!\\" After I finished it, happily satisfied and thinking about reading it again, I looked it up online. That's when I realized that there already was a movie starring Tim Allen, which vaguely resembled, but not quite measured up to the intense emotion of the book. Isn't it always that way! If I could give more than 5 stars for this book, I would. As it has been said before in other reviews, it is not the typical Christian rendition of Christmas celebration, but it is heartfelt and so very well written by Mr. Grisham. Anyone rethinking their Christmas festivities and \\"what's really important\\" will find this book wonderfully heartwarming and reminiscent of times gone by when neighbors actually talked to one another.

B002VECLVO|5.0|At first I thought it was a bit slow and was not thrilled about the jumping back and forth in time. After reading an excellent review here on Amazon by Chris Pandolfi I decided to rewatch it...Glad I did! Colin Firth was exceptional and really nailed this performance. I don't want to give too much away but he really shows us what both love and loss can do to someone. I liked how the film was shot and Directed. Overall a very good film that really makes you think of Colin Firth as a serious actor and not, though great in, The Bridget Jones films. He really has a terrific range. Julianne Moore is stunning and of course gives a great performance as usual. Be ready to sit down and watch this all the way through to really take it all in.
B0026RHR6K|4.0|Love the series, and this package has all the episodes/webisodes you'd need to get the full experience. The only complaint is the packaging is unnecessarily large and not very good.  Each seasons discs are basically just thrown in a box - the sleeving system they were going for doesn't work at all and we will likely just have to buy a CD holder to put them all in. They also don't have a written guide to episodes and discs which is always a nice to have.
0142410705|5.0|An Abundance of Katherines sounded unique. So I went for it. I thought it was a great book. The beginning was a little tough to stick through, but I found myself reading hungrily not too far into the novel. The humor is fantastic, with plenty of one-liners that you'll want to quote to all your friends. While some chapters were slow, and the characters could be frustrating at times, the novel was an interesting read. The characters really developed and grew by the end of the story. The book holds a lot of good lessons about moving on and being yourself. I found it very enjoyable.
B0025KVLTM|3.0|Received in good condition and quite promptly with no glitches on the disc.      I found the sound of the remastered CD to be surprisingly poor in light of the bright '#1s' and 'Yellow Submarine Songtrack' mixes of recent years.  Though more bassey and the vocals more to th fore, the sound otherwise was almost muddy and required significant equalization on my part.      My 'Nero' ripped and sound-enhanced copy proved more crystelline and definitive.    The video add-on was stylishly produced though too short and insubstantial to be worth further discussion.    The CD outlay itself however is well designed and quite informative.
B00386EZJU|5.0|John Powell has crafted some ambitious soundtracks in the past and, at times, the pieces would fit together and make beautiful music. With How to Train Your Dragon, Powell has put everything together and made an incredible musical experience. The action cues are complex and rousing, with numerous layers that each merit solo attention while blending with the whole.    For me, though, the highlight is the emotion of the music. \\"Test Drive,\\" as perhaps my favorite track, is a great example of this. Powell transitions from an exciting and uplifting flying theme to a tense moment of suspense before pulling up into a full-blown rush of exhilaration. I get goosebumps virtually every time I hear it. Powell has finally lived up to his past potential, and this is his must-have album.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|Year's only half over; I don't care.  This is the album of the year, hands or anything else down.  Great minimalist dreampop, songwriting with just enough of the right kinds of hooks, pretty good lyrics all the way through, and--that fantastic voice.  Victoria Legrand's voice has warmth and spine at the same time, a classic velvet-gloved steel weapon.  She's got a bit of that heavy French female contralto thing working, quite in contrast to the wispy, thin voices of girls who usually sing dreampop.  This is the secret of Beach House, the dialectic that really drives this band:  dreamy songs (and instrumentation), but with a physically (and emotionally) rugged singer.  The choice of producer Chris Coady seems inspired; he took the band's sound from its first two albums (already very good)and refined it somewhat, giving it just a bit more edge here. Indiepop--whatever that is exactly--has a new classic
0689865384|5.0|I enjoyed this book. While I was hesitant to give it five stars, (I'd say it's a four-and-a-half star book), the entire book left me excited to read more. I bought this book after remembering that a few of my classmates had read it back in the day, and immediately after finishing it, I ordered Pretties. The concept is incredibly intriguing. The characters can get muddled and confusing, such as all the people besides Tally, Peris, Shay, David, and maybe Croy. A lot of the Smokies did not seem like whole individuals to me. Other than that, I think Tally, while unlikable at many points in the story, is realistic because of her flaws. The pressures of her society cause her to put being pretty above all else. If she were entirely perfect and always made the right choices, her character would seem much more fake. The romance was surprising and exciting, like it should be. All in all, this book was one of the best reads I've picked up all summer.
B002VPE7AQ|2.0|I'm going to start this by saying the following: Thank God this was only a library read!  Seriously, I've been burned too many times by books that I could've gotten from the library (seriously, they were right there on the display...right in front of me!), yet buy them instead.  So, at least I'm not upset I wasted my money on this book.  I picked up Perfect Chemistry because it was one of those books that has been talked about immensely.  It just had the best buzz!  So, I decided to check it out of my library (YAY! for libraries).  I think this is one of those instances where the hype really hurt a book for me.  If it wasn't so hyped up maybe I would've given this three stars.  But alas, it was too hyped up and it's rating suffered.<br /><br />First things, first: I loved the fact that this was about an interracial relationship.  There aren't that many books out there like that in YA-world, at least not compared to the non-interracial ones.  But that could not save the book for me.  My main gripe with Perfect Chemistry was that the main characters were so unlikeable.  Alex was a complete and total jerk most of the time.  Sure, it turns out that he was a nice guy deep down (really, really, really deep down), but I really couldn't let that excuse his jerkiness.  Brittany was also completely annoying.  She only liked Alex if he was doing what she wanted him to do.  (A bit of a SPOILER is needed here so that I could continue my rant...)  Dude, she basically slept with Alex just so he wouldn't go and do that drug deal.  Sure, she loved him and all that, but the main reason she had sex with him was because of the drug deal.  And I'm sorry Brittany, but using sex as a weapon, basically makes you a bit of a jerk, too.<br /><br />The book was also uber-mushy.  Granted, I'm not really a romance fan, but I can handle it in YA (I am a huge Sarah Dessen and Deb Caletti fan, after all).  But this was just too cheesy for me to handle.  The whole \\"And everyone lives happily ever after\\" just seemed unrealistic to me.  And I'm not going to even get started on the epilogue...<br /><br />The reason I gave this two stars instead of the dreaded one (apparently I'm getting way too easy in handing out ones and that certainly wasn't the case a few months ago) is because I LOVED the supporting characters.  I found Sierra and Doug to be absolutely adorable (see I'm not completely cold-hearted when it comes to romance).  I also thought that Isa was a terrific friend and I was more than a little endeared by her.  I loved Paco, Sam, and Gary (who just had too little to do here.  I wanted more of him).  Ms. Peterson also seemed to be like one of those rare teachers that really makes a difference in students' lives.  Needless to say I loved her, too.  I also liked the whole thing with the gang wars.  I found it interesting.  So not all of Perfect Chemistry was bad.<br /><br />So, in the end I have to say that Perfect Chemistry was definitely not my cup of tea.  It was just too cheesy and predictable.

B003MXLUBU|3.0|While it is great to get access to these outtakes they aren't the missing link by any stretch of the imagination. Worth hearing but won't provide sustained enjoymens after a few listens. Also, I read somewhere that there are overdubs from now (?) on some tracks. That's definitely not what we were looking for. Can someone explain to me what certain reviewers don't like about the \\"compression\\" on the re-masters. Is it that it sounds good on digital feedback but sounds thinner and colder on decent hi-fi? Txs to anyone who can explain it to me.

The nod to Spanish classical music might have looked good on the charts, but of Davis's collaborations with Gil Evans, this one I can do without.
0061450162|2.0|Smoke and Mirrors was not to my taste.  I found a few gems in the book, for for the most part I found the collection to be a bit much to swallow.  Many of the stories simply fell flat, and the, er, poetry, was simply painful.  As a whole, the collection made me feel like I was back in Freshman Creative Writing (which, coincidentally, is where I first heard of Neil Gaiman, as so many of my classmates cooed over the brilliance of American Gods).<br /><br />Gaiman is typically hit-or-miss for me, and this volume just happens to be a strong \\"miss.\\"

B000SMWUPS|5.0|This is well worth it for the price.  I really like the cupholders, the big middle area and the zippered pocket.  It straps on well to my Bumbleride Indie (one cup holder just wasn't enough - I realized at the water park last week).  I had a number of options, read the reviews on this one and SO glad I got the cheapest - it is really made well - how refreshing when lots of these baby companies seem to try to gouge us new parents.

B000AP04OM|5.0|I loved this movie. Julie Andrews was great, she has a voice that was just amazing...I realize that many of the younger viewers wont understand what's coming out of her mouth since she is actually SINGING and not just 'rapping' or using some cheap electronic tricks to mimic talent. The other thing they are doing in the movie is dancing...I realize no one is 'grindin dey azz' against anyone else's groin; and sure you can't see any nipples bouncing out of clothes, but trust me they are dancing.<br /><br />I think the best part of the movie is that our kids can learn history. I realize that WWII is kind of covered in school now, but do they teach you that not only were the Nazis mean, but they were great dancers too? I didn't think so. Also, remember that Nazi was the name for the \\"National Socialist\\" party in Germany (sort of like Democrat is the name for socialist in this country), and since we are heading rapidly into socialism we need to learn that it will be much more tolerable if we learn to dance and sing about tiny flowers. It will make the next few years so much more tolerable. For this reason alone, this is an important movie for a new generation.<br /><br />For further help see also [[ASIN:B0009X75GA Killer Tomatoes Eat France]]

0061537934|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone but especially those of you who love your dog. I laughed,cried,rejoiced and sometimes was very angry but I couldn't put it down.The best part was that it was told through the eyes of Enzo the dog. It is a very different concept, but I really liked it. I learned so much from this dog and his way of thinking and feeling. The book had so many lessons to be learned by all of humanity.Enzo and Denny, his master/best friend were sometimes inseparable. They loved his wife,Eve and their daughter Zoe almost equally, if that's possible. But you'll understand once you read the book. It is well worth the time. It is about love, forgiveness, faith, hope and fortitude and of course race cars.<br /><br />Jennifer Dunagan,author of<br />Auntie Jennie's Puppy:The<br />Adventures of Santana and<br />Santana's Harrowing Halloween
B002TVQ4HG|3.0|This movie is certainly one of the more unusual ones I've seen, if not the most misleading (in terms of promotion).  The cover art (depending on which one you look at) shows what appears to be some psycho-killer flick with probably a lot of blood and gore, or some weird ghost romp on an abandoned ship in the Bermuda Triangle.  I honestly wouldn't have watched it had I not read reviews that implied it was hardly a cheesy remake of Friday the 13th on a boat.  For a lazy Friday afternoon, I figured it was worth a shot.    For the first twenty minutes, I seriously thought all those reviewers had been lying.  \\"Triangle\\" had the makings of an overdone psycho killer on the sea.  To summarize, Melissa George's character (a single mother of an autistic child) has apparently taken her son to a special school so she can join some friends for a day cruise on a sailboat.  Calling them \\"friends\\" may be an overstatement, as the group consists of a guy she met at the diner she works at (who invited her along) and all his friends, who don't think to highly of her.  They head out to sea, hear a strange message over the radio, and are abruptly overrun by a storm that capsizes their boat.  After the storm, all seems lost until an eerie old cruise ship appears from nowhere and stops for them.  Despite seeing someone clearly aboard from afar, they find the boat empty, minus some blood and bizarre messages on walls.  Then, people start getting killed... rather quickly in terms of plot, I might add.  It was turning into that campy slasher flick I didn't want to watch and, had I stopped there, that's what I thought it would have been.    But, things shifted gears.  Drastically.  It turns out that everything revealed to us thus far is not what it seems.  I won't spoil the twist, but I will emphasize that it makes the movie significantly more interesting.  To make things better, it is hardly the only twist in the film, and the later one is even more shocking.  By the time film reached the end, I felt very satisfied with the 2nd and 3rd acts.  It left a lot of unanswered questions.    Overall, I give this film 3 stars.  It still had the makings of a B-rate film, which I am generally not a fan of.  Following the twists, the movie got superbly better, but the 1st act significantly weighed it down to the point where it left a bitter aftertaste.  While I can appreciate the ending, the 1st part needed to be direly improved.  I suggest saving this one for a rental.

1934356557|5.0|I recently got a new job and inherited a vast collection of SQL queries to maintain. Reading Karwin's book has been a tremendous help! Each chapter considers a particular design issue (\\"How can I store more than one value in a field?\\") and shows the most common, flawed method (the \\"antipattern\\"). He carefully explains the disadvantages, then usually shows several other ways to accomplish the same goal.     One of the things I like best about the book is that the analysis isn't black and white. Every methods has advantages and disadvantages, which Karwin carefully unpacks. He also reviews and clarifies relational theory as he goes: his discussion of \\"Null\\" is a masterpiece. In general, he favors solutions that don't subvert the basic principles of relational database theory.    This would not be a good book to try to learn SQL or Database theory from, but if you are just starting to get some real-world experience it is a Godsend. Highly Recommended.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I stumbled across this CD from a friend and could not get the tunes out of my head. I purchased the cd and simply love it from the beginning to the end. It is great to hear something fresh; majority of songs on the radio sounds alike. Janelle Monae is brilliant! The mixture of genres can be heard in all of her songs! I LOVE IT!! I just hope that the industry doesn't try to change her! P-Diddy has signed a great artist (please don't change her)! My four year old daughter told me she thought her voice was beautiful the first time she heard \\"Sir Greendown\\". I must agree! Well done Janelle Monae!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I have never been a fan of comedy films; my favorite movies are usually dramas, thrillers, and the occasional autobiographical feature. I find most comedies are written poorly and you have to have an IQ of about 3 to enjoy them. However, I came across \\"Scary Movie\\" late one night on television and I have to say it is downright hilarious and funny. This film is the first in a series in which the producers and writers mock classic horror films, but they do it in a very tasteful and caring way. Movies like \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"The Amytyville Horror\\" are satarized and when I saw those parts of the film I was on the floor with laughter! James Woods, most notably known for his serious dramatics parts, has a small role as the exorcist in \\"Scary Movie\\" where he tries to exorcise the demon out of a girl. Woods scenes are the best and he steals every funny part from his co-stars. The bathroom scene where he sits on the commode is not to be missed! If your down and want to put a smile on your face put \\"Scary Movie\\" in your DVD player. Other sequels follwed this film, but the original is simple the best.
0307271862|4.0|I love to read mysteries. It's the first section I always check out when I am looking for something to read. As a result, I have read many, many titles in this genre and have grown tired of the typical LA or New York gumshoe stereotype. With the exception of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch, I am just not interested in a new title featuring some (ex)-alcoholic, self-destructive detective who works against the system to find the newest serial killer. But even Bosch is getting a little rote lately. So, I search out mysteries with anything out of the ordinary, picking up just about any mystery set in another country, time or written by a foreign author. This has led me to find the works of James Lee Burke (I rabidly await each new James Robicheaux title) and Louis Bayard, to name just a few of the discoveries I have enjoyed.<br /><br />When Amazon Vine made \\"The Man from Beijing\\" available, I jumped at the chance to read the newest book by Swedish author Hanning Mankell. I have seen his Kurt Wallander novels in bookstores, but never tried one. I decided it was time.<br /><br />I quickly realized this new title was a 'stand-alone' featuring a new character, the middle-aged Judge Brigitta Roslin. While I was initially disappointed, I think this is ultimately a better way to experience Mankell's writing, especially since I am not starting with the first Wallander title.<br /><br />A horrific mass murder in a remote Swedish village near the Norway border, in the dead of night and the middle of winter, sets the police force on edge. They have never seen anything like this crime; all 19 of the elderly people living in the little village are killed along with a young boy who appears to have been visiting one of the couples. The sheer number of murders and their brutality cause the police to shift into overdrive and cause them to scramble for clues and leads, leading them further away from the truth. Brigitta Roslin, over-worked and dissatisfied with her long marriage to a cold, unresponsive train conductor, realizes she may be connected to the town; her mother once lived there. She is drawn to the area, using an unplanned medical leave to visit the remote village. While visiting her mother's former house, she finds a diary from an ancestor recounting his days as a foreman while overseeing Chinese workers and the building of the transcontinental railroad in America 150 years earlier. Brigitta realizes there is a connection and finds out a strange Chinese man was staying near the village around the time of the slaying. She begins to connect the dots and decides to accompany an old friend on a trip to Beijing. While there, she attracts the attention of a number of people and soon realizes her life may be in danger.<br /><br />As this is my first experience with Mankell's writing, I am unable to compare \\"Beijing\\" to any of the Wallander books. But I like Mankell's writing style and liked many things about this book. But I also didn't like some things about the story.<br /><br />As I read the book, I felt Mankell was being sparse with his words. Yet, as I delved deeper into the book, I felt the title would benefit from a stronger edit. Shifting back and forth like this, while reading, made for an interesting experience. At times, Mankell simply states a character's emotion or state of mind. \\"Brigitta Roslin felt tired\\" is a very vague example. As I read various examples of this type of statement, I felt the author was trying to keep things moving and I found this a bit refreshing. Mankell goes into more detail when he feels it necessary, when he doesn't we get short declarative statements. I have found other authors born in other countries do a similar thing. Then, as the story develops, Mankell begins to incorporate lengthy back-stories about other characters involved in Brigitta's life, giving us what seem to be minute details about the political and economic climate of the time. One character has a lengthy inner monologue about the conflictbetween preserving the past and paving the way for the future of Beijing in preparation for the Olympic games. Then, there are lengthy inner-monologues about the Chinese government's involvement (colonization?) of various African governments. You may ask what possible connection these passages could have to an aging Swedish judge, but they do connect. I'm just not sure we need all of the details Mankell provides us. In a sense, the reader becomes extremely well-informed about all of these characters, but it becomes a slow read.<br /><br />When the story seems well-focused, this same attention to detail helps to bring the narrative alive. As Brigitta arrives in, and explores, the area where the killings took place, we see the area developing before our eyes as she would, gathering details and building a picture. When she visits a small rundown hotel, we get an instant sense of the state of the facility, the people who work there, their attitude. He does a great job of bringing the locations and the people to life.<br /><br />Judge Brigitta Roslin is about as unconventional a hero as you can get. A middle-aged female Judge, frustrated with the lack of affection from her husband, finds she may have a connection to a horrific mass murder. As she begins to look into details, she finds information the police overlook or don't deem important enough to investigate. And she begins to connect the dots. As she does this, her training as a member of the judiciary, leads her to turn a fresh eye, but an unemotional one (at least most of the time) allowing her to find out information seasoned professionals disregard. Along the way, we learn about her life, her relationship with her husband, children and co-workers, her attitude toward her life and job, her outlook on life. We even learn about her back-story, finding out about her history through conversations she has with her longtime friend. All of this helps to paint a fascinating portrait of a woman we would not normally expect in such a novel.<br /><br />I also appreciate the story because it is fairly unconventional in both narrative and scope. It isn't often we find a protagonist who is a middle-aged female judge. Basically, she asks questions, integrating herself into the story. For much of the novel, she isn't in a lot of danger and this would generally cause me to lose interest. It is a mystery, a suspense novel, and you would expect a certain amount of conflict to keep the narrative moving. Brigitta finds herself in peril late in the novel, very late, but I didn't mind that because I was always interested in where the author was taking us.<br /><br />This is the key problem with \\"The Man From Beijing\\". Mankell takes us to a variety of places that don't seem to have a connection. Once we get there, we have to figure out the connection and when the author establishes this, we are connected. But then he begins to give us too much, providing us the deepest possible knowledge of the history and back-story of these characters and their actions. It is a lot of detail and not all of it is necessary to our understanding of the story. And when this becomes a pattern, the story seems to have a lot of stop signs and pauses interrupting the flow of the story. This is too bad because it is a story that you want to devour. And Mankell's writing seems to insist that we chew each bite 100 times.the way for the future of Beijing in preparation for the Olympic games.

B001GCUO5W|5.0|It has really nice scenes for HD viewing.  Dicaprio does a great job in his intensity and his confusion in dealing with his days attempting to solve a puzzle at the institution. Is he going after someone, trying to expose a conspiracy, or what? Ruffalo, Kingsley and von Sydow are just excellent in their delivery. Kingsley comes across as compassionate, then he is adversarial, then down right confusion. Since the movie takes place just a decade after WWII, you don't know if von Sydow's character is a former Nazi or not. This all adds to the issues that Dicaprio is attempting to uncover. I would have viewed this earlier if not for thinking it was more of a horror film. Overall, the plot is engaging and you are wondering when the next 'big thing' is going to happen. This film may only be a one time view for some. There are so many questions that you have throughout the movie and it seems they are answered at the end. However, the last shot creates a question, so, is what you have at the end the reality or not? Similar in ways to movies like 'The Green Mile' in its depiction of the death of three children or like the surprise you may remember at the end of 'The Sixth Sense.' This movie is sometimes very riveting and you are wondering if he is getting deeper into problems as the movie progresses. To me, there may have been a better viewership of this one if the trailers did not make it look like a horror movie. At least to me, seeing what they portrayed made it look like that more than a suspense thriller.
B0035J6TAI|4.0|First off, I really do not like cover albums. Secondly, since Gabriel left Genesis, he has seemed to become more and more pretentious as the decades have passed. He is notoriously slow at working on his projects. However, his solo work has been brilliant and compelling especially the last studio album Up. I had no interest in a cover album and was not going to waste my time with this. If Gabriel is too good to join back with the old boys for a tour why should i give him my attention, right? Well, I borrowed this album from an acquaintance and have to say i was more than surprised as well as quite pleased. The only song I knew is Bowie's Heroes but it matters not whether you know whose song he is singing. It might actually be better to have never heard some of these songs in their original recordings. Scratch My Back is an odd title, although it works within his concept of other artists covering his songs on another recording. Yet, the album is beautiful and moving. My Body is a Cage surprised me. It is an awesome track as is the following The Book of Love. Gabriel's reinterpretation of Bowie also works well.<br />I still don't like cover albums but Gabriel has done a great job in both his vocal performance and arranging of these songs and deserves at least a listen.
B000GSA59M|3.0|Please be aware that although this is a fantastic mixer, the description is somewhat deceptive.  The description says it comes with recording software, which it does.  The problem is, is that it requires you to purchase additional software.  Sure you can use the free program Audacity that comes with it.  But when using audacity, it's like being back in the early 80's and trying to record your favorite song off the radio with the tape recorder.  Too much time being spent editing!  Or, you can upgrade to some lame ass software I've never heard of before.  Here is the real problem I have with this.  In order for you to be able to use this mixer in say Cubase, Ableton, FL Studios etc. you have too purchase the software to incorporate the mixer into your host  The program costs like 19 euros which is about the equivalent of 25 US dollars.  I realize that for the most part, this a relatively inexpensive mixer.  But it becomes a royal pain in the ass, when something or somebody is wanting more money to make something work the way it should.  Like I said before, it's a fantastic little mixer.  BUT THE SOFTWARE ISSUES BLOW!!!
B003RHLIQ8|5.0|I find the series' drama very compelling. Given that the technological background has already been established through the discoveries of the previous series (Goa'uld, Wraith, Ancients, etc) there is not a lot of new ground to break except within the giant technological wonder that is Destiny.    Each episode does a good job of making me want to come back for more to find out what has happened to the crew. Also, most of the characters' developments are solid and by the end of the series I feel like I like (almost) all of the characters and know a good amount about them because of their in-episode personal experiences.    I am not a fan of the romance between younger characters, I find it rather stark and traditional which ends up being a little surprising. Relationships between the more mature characters are slightly more filling.     There are some very likable characters in this series. My favorite is Dr Rush, and 2nd favorite is Sgt Greer. Both can be rather extreme at times, and have contrasting sides within. My least favorite is Chloe, who I feel is the least developed/explored character even though her character speaks and appears a lot. This is my main \\"nit\\" to pick.    Looking forward to the second season in the fall of 2010. For fans of the Stargate series, I recommend SGU with a footnote that there will be less \\"science\\" and more \\"people,\\" it's highly character-driven, rather than based on exploration/acquisition of technologies and worlds.
0446563048|4.0|I finished Tony Hsieh's \\"Delivering Happiness -- A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose,\\" sat back and stared forward.<br /><br />My confusion may have been due in part to the book's byline \\"a path to profits, passion, and purpose\\" or maybe because the Zappos logo was front and center on the book cover because going into the read, I expected a business book about the value of customer service and differentiation.<br /><br />And yeah, for 239 pages, those principles are touched on, but not the extent I expected.  Then, very clearly on page 239, Hsieh states \\"I wanted to write this book for a different reason: to contribute to a happiness movement to help make the world a better place.\\"<br /><br />And it was after reading that passage, that I understood his unrelenting focus on the high-return social experiences, the work/life balance, and the programs that focused on happiness, not necessarily profits.  But it was in that focus on happiness that he found true success.<br /><br />\\"Delivering Happiness\\" reads very much like an autobiography.  In a sense, it's Hsieh's (pronounced Shay) business journey.  From his time at Harvard, to selling LinkExchange to Microsoft for $265 million, to investing in Zappos and his gradual progression to the company's CEO, we follow Hsieh as he takes unconventional approaches to life.<br /><br />The sentence above reads as if Hsieh had an easy road to success.  But what my 'at-a-glance' review fails to convey are the true trials and tough decisions Hsieh and team faced when trying to get Zappos from a zero-profit company to a for-profit company.  It's one thing to work long hours and devote yourself to a cause, but it was refreshing to see Hsieh's dedication to the growing company in form of financial contributions.  Selling personal real estate investments and investing your life savings is a strong statement.<br /><br />But the one thing that's caused me to go back and review my own approach to revenue-building strategies was Hsieh's belief that if you \\"focus on making sure that your product or service continually wows people,\\" the profits, the press coverage, the success -- it'll all follow.<br /><br />So instead of telling prospects why you're so much better than your competition, your focusing on your current customers' happiness.  By \\"wowing\\" them in the regular transactions, they'd act as your company's devoted sales team on your behalf.<br /><br />Sifting through the narrative, I took a lot of notes on customer service management, leveraging core competencies, and unconventional leadership.

1402720602|4.0|I bought this book twice, some months ago for the first time.  I read it first and afterwards I study it some more, to get full knowledge of some details described.  Shortly after, I went for a trip of a month to Brazil, knowing that I will spend a lot of hours travelling from Europe to Brazil and also have a lot of national flights over there, enough time to do some interesting reading and study, instead of playing as all the other passengers with there laptop during the flights.     In Brazil I always meet with a Brazilian Luthier friend of me, also this trip.  I discovered that he didn't have this wonderful \\"must have\\" in his bookshelf yet, and at that moment I decided to give him a nice present, and went home without it.    Afterward I bought myself a new one because there is so much information in this book to expand my knowledge, even after a few wonderful instruments I had build.  I also ordered the templates and the drawings.  All of them have very good and complete information which had given me the opportunity to build myself a wonderful classical guitar. This was the good part, now problems I run in to; dimensions.   My conclusions check and recheck all the given dimensions.   Text and drawings are OK, but the given dimensions are sometimes incorrect and also are a mix up of metric (mm) and imperial (inch) dimensions together.    I feel when reading the book, that the author must be a very good skilled classical guitar builder willing to exchange his full knowledge.  He gave me with his book a look in his world of guitar building, a book with a lot of very nice illustrations and it's not boring reading at all.    I recommend this book as the best there is in classical guitar making, a \\"must have\\" for everyone building his first guitar or the more experienced builder.    Ray,        from the Netherlands.
0307577589|5.0|I loved this book. Some considered it dark and violent but I have read books a lot more gruesome. This book has a lot of Swedish names and places but that does not at all affect the understanding or enjoyment. The main character, the girl with the dragon tattoo, is so incredibly interesting - unlike anyone I have every met. I am just now starting the next one, The Girl Who Played with Fire. It is proving to be just as good. I would highly recommend this book.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|All of the Twilight's motion picture soundtracks have something special to them. Their lyrics all have hidden meanings and are obviously chosen very carefully. The soundtrack has sort of a grunge, rock and roll mixed with an easy listening sound to it. If you're a fan of the movie, the music will take you right back into the story. I would gladely purchase this CD again, it is not a purchase I regret. Enjoy.
B003HI3MSE|2.0|Because..    This CD and the lostprophets recent release are very disappointing and that's usually a sign that the partying is good.  Maybe they're worn out from touring but still the partying would be good.  The music is suffering.    Well really the music here is somewhat good but the lyrics would make Atreyu or Children of Bodom blush.      I really don't care how anybody's girlfriend smells but if you have to put that in there at least put it in the harsh vocal parts where most people won't understand all of it so it doesn't ruin the whole dammed song...possibly the whole CD.  Come on...if the lyrics mature this group will be very, very good.    I've really tried to like this CD.  I've listened to it at least 12 times.  I've kicked back and listened to it all by itself with no distractions.  I've listened to it working out.  I've listened to it in the car doing 80 miles and hour.  I mean I've tried man, I've tried.  The only time through it that I liked it I was a little drunk but then I played it 2 more times to be sure only to end up wondering what the he11 I was thinking?    I'm thinking I might listen to it next time I get drunk...I guess that's worth a 2.    (weed makes the lyrics even worse because you just sit there and dwell on them so no need to bother going there)

It felt a tad long at times (as most novels seem to) but didn't slow down or get dry to the point of making me want to give up on my efforts of reading to that point. I thought it was about on par with what I've come to expect and enjoy in this series.
B0015DROBO|2.0|While this book had a good plot, that is superceded by the trash and violence and degradation that the author chooses to portray. I will not read any other of his books.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|By far the best show I have seen on tv since the days of \\"Seinfeld.\\" Seinfeld left us in what '97 or '98 and I've never been so dedicated to watching a show like Modern Family since Kramer last raided Jerry's fridge.
141450005X|5.0|This is the story of second chances. After eight years, Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot find each other after a forced separation. The illustrations are beautiful, but not all of them were included in this particular edition, which is why this is four-star and not five.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay, let me start by saying that I don't exercise regularly. I try to get in 30 minutes at least 2-3 times a week rather it is walking, doing the elliptical, or just doing some cardio. I would say that I am in average shape but I could stand to lose 5-10 pounds.<br /><br />To say that this DVD KICKED my butt is an understatement! Level 1 was a struggle for me. I think I need a level -1. It was almost discouraging for me!! However, if you can stay focused and do what you can, it will pay off. It really is a great workout and you can definitely feel the difference. My legs were sore for 2 days after my workout!<br /><br />I'm not a big Jillian Michaels fan, in fact, I find her sort of annoying! But let me assure you she will push you in this video and you will get a good workout!<br /><br />If you want a good workout that will truly give you a feeling of an accomplishment this is your DVD!! Just stick with it and start shredding :-)
B001FB5634|5.0|The movie is good. There are few characters, but the acting is near flawless. The story is great and the concept is just plain realistic. This scenario could possibly happen and I can honestly say that I could easily envision a planet like the one depicted in the movie.     The movie is depressing and haunting because it is so realistic and it represents a possible future reality.     From what I have heard from people not liking it, the reasons they don't like it are because it doesn't explain the cause of the new, wasteland conditions of the planet, and because it's so real.    Seriously? That doesn't make a movie bad. It makes a movie different . . . . and GOOD.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|Well, I have to agree somewhat with the disappointed reviewer and with the viewer that apparently absolutely loved it. I definitely wouldn't call it a Holiday favorite, but it does have it's moments.  As I sat in the theatre the noise of clanking chains was quite deafening.  The animation was done well, but the story just didn't quite flow for me.  Maybe I'm just too used to previous remakes to allow myself to truly enjoy this. The obvious usual suspects were included in this remake, ie, ghosts, Scrooge, Tiny Tim (briefly), friends of his through the past.......but I felt something was missing.  I really can't put my finger on it.  I would suggest you rent it just because it is a classic, but wait until close to Christmas.  That way it will help you feel the magic of the season and the movie a little better!
0553582445|5.0|I read and reviewed the three books in the Farseer Trilogy.  They were wonderful.  I was surprised picking up FOOL'S ERRAND, The Tawny Man Book 1 that FitzChivalry was back, sure 15 years later but the adventures in the Six Duchies continue, with the characters from the other books.  Robin Hobb does a great job filling in the reader about the past and I think this series could be read as a stand alone, but I highly recommend reading the other trilogy first.  They are both great stories.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000ZN802W|5.0|This is a great movie.  The shipping on the other hand was poor.  I paid for 2nd day air to get it by my daughters birthday.  I received it 5 days after it shipped.  They won't reimburse me for the extra shipping I paid.
0385341008|4.0|\\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is epistolary, meaning it is comprised entirely of correspondence, or letters.  Think \\"Old Testament.\\"  Since it's impolite to read other people's \\"snail mail,\\" the style of the book lets you be a vicarious voyeur into the lives of Juliet, Sidney, and other survivors of World War II near London, England.  At first it's kind of girly when writer Juliet muses about what book to write.  Out of the blue she gets a letter from a gentleman on the island of Guernsey.  Soon we learn about Elizabeth, an inspirational woman who helped the Guernsey islanders cope with the occupation of their island by the German troops.  As the details are shared about food shortages, secret meetings and various hardships of war, you also become acquainted with diverse and spunky Guernsey island residents.  Here the story grips you with questions on how Juliet will go ahead with her book and her life after meeting \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society.\\"
B00005JMXX|5.0|I love this movie. always have and when i discovered that y'all had it on dvd that only made my life so much better.
B00008972S|5.0|This movie is brilliant from all perspectives, is a classic, the music in one of the best scores from twentieth century, and the story, tha dances, the actors, wow. I love this movie and i always will be. If you feel like me, get this edition, the Special Collector's Set. The set is incredible and the documentary is great.
B0026RLM6Q|5.0|i grew up watching this show. i use to have this cd when i was little but then it got scratched up and all and then i bought it again at wal-mart while i was in college and it went missing. then i was on here and found it and decided to buy it. thanks guys
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This box set is expensive but is so good it really does not matter. If looks could kill this box set would do in seconds, is so beautiful, is so well done, the replicas of vinyl are a very good job. Anyway, the important thing here is the music and generally The Beatles in mono, with some exceptions, are better. Albums like Rubber Soul and Revolver sounds really good, no more weird separations, no more excessive reverb on vocals that use to make songs like Drive my car sounds too old. Now the songs sound like really good rock&roll. If you are wondering about this box set, don't be shy, just buy it.
B000FC13Y0|3.0|Slightly shocked when I came across a ...explicit scene at page eleven. Good book besides that.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I was so sad when they took Dr Quinn off the air all those years ago, but now I can watch it all over again. It is the most wonderful series ever. Just wholesome fun and a wonderful love story. And Sully, who couldn't just love him to death! Well worth the money I paid. To bad they don't have a series like this now although it would proably never survive in these times.
1417082658|4.0|Intelligent, tense, frosty drama with thriller overtones.  It's very good, but three things hold it back from being flat out terrific: 1) Scarlett Johanssen is fair in a role that needed somebody great.  She's sexy all right, but there's a necessary layer of complexity missing.  2) There are some big logic holes in the last 1/3 that rely on us buying a lot of coincidence and 3) Allen has basically already made the same film much more deeply and inventively in Crimes and Misdemeanors.  Still, in a vacuum, one of the better films of 2005

0307346617|3.0|The ability to create something new, fresh or original with Zombies (or vampires while we're at it) is not an easy task.   The market has been saturated with the undead, and zombies have been spun every direction imaginable.  On those terms I have to give Max Brooks credit for a presentation that is fairly original.   However, the narrative starts to wear thin by the half-way point and as I got towards the end I came to the realization this wasn't going anywhere.   There's nothing holding these series of micro-stories together, other than a narrator that is completely undeveloped.  Let me put this another way; you could pull this book apart by chapter, re-assemble in random sequence, and get nearly the same result.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, next to Casino. If you have this on dvd you should definitely get it on blu-ray. The picture quality is nice and the colors are vibrant, not as nice as casino, but you can't tell the difference in picture quality.Audio is excellent as well. I just had to get this on blu-ray to add to my collection.
B000BYRCGU|5.0|I thought the movie would arrive in a week or so but, it took three days so I'm a happy customer with this deal.
B001EIOOV8|5.0|I gotta say i love this movie first and foremost and love it even more on bluray. Everything is mind blowing from the colors to the picture quality and audio. One of the best movies ever made. I can watch this over and over again. It's definitely a treat for the eyes and ears. This is a must for anyones  collection.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I've always been an Eminem fan, I mean I have all of his albums. As we all know Encore wasn't the best work he's done and Relapse was definitely a step in the right direction but like he says in \\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\" \\"Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing them out\\". Without a doubt Eminem came back with a vengeance with Recovery. I'll be honest out of all my friends I was really the only one who was truly hyped for Recovery. Of course I forced them to listen to it and now it's like they've always been Eminem fans. When I looked at the track listing I was excited to see Lil' Wayne on the album after their two previous joint products (\\"Drop the World\\" and \\"Forever Remix\\")we all knew it would be fire and they did not disappoint what so ever. Looking at the rest of the track listing though I noticed P!NK and Rhianna and a huge question mark popped up I was worried my favorite rapper had sold out but \\"Won't Back Down\\" and \\"Love The Way You Lie\\" are some of the best songs on the cd. I will say \\"Almost Famous\\" is without a doubt the most \\"Shady\\" track in all seriousness the song could have been on the Marshall Mathers LP or The Eminem Show and it would have fit right in. The best song on the cd however, is \\"Spacebound\\" amazing hook, amazing verses, and amazing production. I'm happy that Recovery came out and was so different from what everyone was expecting. It shows Shady is here to stay proving that he can adapt the ever evolving world of hip hop. He is without a doubt one of the best rappers to ever do it and he will forever be a legend in the genre.
0307454541|2.0|This book doesn't live up to the hype.  The translation from Swedish to English is awkward and unintentionally funny.  The author wastes way, way too much time telling us everyone in Sweden uses Apple computers and buys their furniture at IKEA.  The characters, particularly Lisbeth Salander, are hypocrites.  Lisbeth is somehow entitled to her privacy, but she can snoop on others electronically without condemnation.  We're supposed to be happy for her, too, when she steals millions of dollars from a sexually deviant capitalist.  Lame, lame, lame.<br /><br />Her journalist partner, Mikael, is a sleazebag who sleeps with  his editor, Erika, who is married.  No respect for the cuckolded husband.  Oh, he also manages to bang Lisbeth when she throws herself at him.  Self-restraint in professional relationships must not be what it used to be.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality about this book is the mystery behind the disappearance of a girl in the 60s.
B002VLKIFS|5.0|Meaningful...yet hilarious!  Don't let this first novel pass you by.  I have an interest in books that take the reader through struggles of family life.  Quick does an outstanding job in writing about a family's journey and he achieves it through the backdrop of their intense love for the Philadelphia Eagles.  I've never been to Philly but I imagine there are a few fans that share this same intense love for the Birds!  This book will stay with me forever!
0312944926|1.0|An cyber-action thriller set within the confines of the NSA, this tale focuses on a beautiful and talented young woman whose rise in the intelligence community is seen with envy and suspicion by her colleagues.  When she discovers an unlikely plot, however, she must unravel the complex series of conspiracies in order to save the day... or rather in order for her boyfriend to save the day.     Beyond the complete lack of technological understanding shown in this novel, this story suffers from a very sad form of sexism that is latent in Brown's works.  The author tries to make for a strong female protagonist, but instead creates a character who is sexy but weak and plays into a stereo-type heroine who needs a man to do the physical stuff.

B003BKF696|5.0|This came home with me a few weeks ago and hasn't left the stereo. As good as the individual songs are, it is the totality of the atmosphere that brings me back.  This is crazy but it reminds me of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in that certain themes and sounds tie the entire collection together. Whether late at night, early in the morning or at high noon, you can escape into a high violent world.
B003GX5CWY|4.0|\\"Predator\\" is a guilty pleasure since there really isn't much in the way of great acting or deep hidden meaning, but there are a lot of things blowing up, a very cool alien, and some great hammy lines delivered by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jessy Ventura!<br /><br />No Spoilers from me: The plot is fairly straight forward, a special ops team gets dropped in the jungle to rescue the crew of a downed chopper and things just do not go as planned... The special effects are fairly good and hold up well enough.<br /><br />Again, not very deep but a lot of fun when you are just looking for an action sci-fi to watch.<br /><br />Recommended! Amazon tends to lump all of the reviews for movies, regardless of which of the various media formats (DVD, Blu-ray, Video On Demand, etc) you bought.

0967175429|5.0|Theta Healing combines two of her previous books Go up and work with God,and Go up and seek God with additional material.<br /><br />Her personal story is compelling. She discovered a healing technique when working on other people. She had cancer in the leg, and was going to lose the leg, so she applied the technique, and was able to save her leg and her life.<br /><br />It's certainly interesting to see this theta healing technique described. You are using a deeper state of mind, to connect with the source, to rearrange your DNA, and effect permanent positive changes and healing. Theta is a state of mind associated with deep meditation, light sleep, insight, and creativity.<br /><br />I cannot say for certain whether it works yet because I may not be doing it properly, and I may have beliefs that are blocking me. I do believe the technique has merit. What I have noticed is additional warmth and energy in my body when I am doing this.<br /><br />I do believe you can clear many emotional issues when you are in a theta state, and there is an emotional aspect to many illnesses. Also, Theta visualization is fun.<br /><br />If you have difficulty accessing the Theta state, which I believe most people will, I recommend you get the Dr Jeffrey Thompson cd's, [[ASIN:B00005BGUJ Theta Meditation System]], and [[ASIN:B0002A2VFK Awakened Mind System 2.0]]. These will help lead your mind to the desired state.  Learning hypnosis and being able to visualise easily is also a help.<br /><br />In this book are many repatterning techniques, as the author has studied NLP. So, you can overcome emotional issues, and replace limiting beliefs using the techniques in this book. These are very useful, and it is difficult to find many books that cover this issue properly. I would recommend this book for this reason alone.<br /><br />There are techniques for creating for your own reality, which I feel would work, including attracting a soul mate. One of these is a Huna technique similar to what I am already using, and I believe this would work for you too. I have used something which is a hybrid of this and the Huna ha rite to great effect.<br /><br />The method from the book I most use is the prayer/intention method.<br /><br />The world is constantly evolving, and if you use books such as this and anything by Sanaya Roman, you will be on the cutting edge of our spiritual evolution, and understand better than most how the world works, and work with it, and make it work for you.<br /><br />If you were to use this book, you will benefit from it. It also has many profound insights. I hope this review was helpful to you.for you too. I have used something which is a hybrid of this and the Huna ha rite to great effect.

B00004UEDQ|4.0|Before The Blind Side hit it big, Sandra Bullock was an undervalued asset. She made a lot of films, some good, some awful, but she got blamed for the failures, and never got credit for her good performances. Since winning the Oscar and then being cheated on by Jesse James, the public's sympathy has shifted 180 degrees. For a while there it was 24/7 Bullock, Bullock, Bullock on the airwaves, all day/every day. Critics like me are digging up films from the archive and going back to uncover any forgotten gems we may have missed. 28 Days is not the mother lode, it is just a load of Bullock.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br />Gwen Cummings: Is that available stitched on a pillow somewhere?<br />=============================<br /><br />During filming in New York Sandra Bullock stayed in the recently departed Dennis Hopper's apartment and that alone should have inspired the young thespian. Her method of acting involved downing a triple espresso before any scene that required her character to have uncontrollable shakes. Is that how Hopper did it in Blue Velvet? Bullock is allergic to horses, but one scene of equine therapy required her to gain a horse's trust so it would allow her to bend the horse's leg. In spite of her allergies, she bent it. What a trouper.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Betty: Tonight's lecture: Are you a blackout drunk, or don't you remember?<br />==================<br /><br />Betty Thomas, who was an officer on Hill Street Blues, and also acted in such films as Troop Beverly Hills, has stepped behind the camera where she has directed The Brady Bunch Movie and others of that caliber. She also directed Private Parts, the bio pic about shock jock Howard Stern. She is no Orson Welles, but knows how to serve up some light hearted fare such as 28 Days.<br /><br />OK, it is not so bad in a kind of made-for-TV movie, after school special, sit com level acting kind of way. A light hearted romp through rehab. It's no Leaving Las Vegas, Days of Wine and Roses, Rachael Getting Married, or When a Man Loves a Woman. Sandra Bullock has a certain ineffable charm, and the cast of characters are all kind of cute in their own peculiar ways. Alan Tudyk plays Gerhardt, an extremely odd character who improvises a strange monologue about forks in the road. He is perhaps the wackiest neighbor, the Cosmo Kramer, if you will, of 28 Days; but the ever so slightly less odd characters anchor the story.<br /><br />Dominic West plays Jasper, her boyfriend, her enabler, her co dependent. The audience, and eventually Gwen Cummings can see that he is not very helpful to Gwen in her quest for sobriety. Viggo Mortensen plays Eddie Boone, a baseball player with substance abuse issues. He is your average jock, except that he is a secret soap opera fan, showing his softer side. They created a soap opera within the movie, and it was called Santa Cruz. Also a big fan of Santa Cruz was Gwen's roommate Andrea (Azura Skye). Mike O'Malley plays one of the other rehabbers, and he can currently be seen as Kurt's dad on Glee.<br /><br />Steve Buscemi is in this playing a counselor called Cornell. He does an adequate job, but it is not up to the level of his Theodore Donald 'Donny' in 1998's The Big Lebowski. But bottom line, what is?<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Cornell: This isn't a way to live.

B003IPC5SO|5.0|Ever since her album Light Years...this woman is unbeatable.   This album is a breath of fresh air for summer.  If you like Fever or Body Language or X you will love this album.   Kylie is Aphrodite here and everywhere for that matter.  She is as prolific as Madonna but with a softer more care free edge to her.  This album will make you smile...and make you want to dance, after all she keeps asking us to dance with her in \\"All The Lovers\\".  If you love this woman...Buy this album and dance with Kyile you will be happy you did.
B002XMGGJM|3.0|After seeing the previews for this movie, it looked appealing enough to buy.  After watching it however, I probably should've rented it instead.  The movie is about an up and coming hot shot lawyer (played by Jamie Foxx) who has a very high conviction rate (I think the movie says 96%).  In order to protect his record, he refuses to prosecute an accused murderer because he thinks there's a chance he may lose.  He finds out later that there are repercussions for his decision.<br /><br />The movie starts out great.  There's alot of action, you get to meet the main characters, and eventually see how the decision to make a deal with the alleged murderer affects the only living victim to the crime.  Because the victim doesn't feel justice was served, he takes the law into his own hands and ultimately ends up in prison.  While I've never had to deal with being in prison or what takes place in prison, I think it's safe to say that what takes place later on is way beyond what takes place when negotiating with a prisoner accused of murder.  I mean really, when would a prisoner ask for and receive a steak dinner from a fancy restaurant (unless on death row maybe)? What about an expensive mattress?  Nonetheless, things quickly get out of control as a game of cat and mouse takes place.  This entire cat and mouse game makes the movie longer than it should be.  It also makes it more unreal as more shenanigans are used to stretch the movie out.  All in all, it appears what started off as a drama, mystery, and horror movie eventually turns into a comedy.<br /><br />As far as the acting, everyone brings their A game, but it's only so much you can do with a movie like this.  If you are watching this because you are a Jaimie Foxx fan, you won't be disappointed.  If you are watching because you are looking for a well written plot that's filled with intrigue and action, you may want to watch something else.
B003N7GATM|5.0|Let me say I have been a fan of NIN since I first bought the \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" on cassette.  This is like hearing NIN for the first time all over again....but with a womans voice instead.  You can still hear Trent on a few of the tracks but Mariqueen Maandig's voice is more the focus, and her voice blends well with the music just as Trent's does.  I knew after seeing the video \\"The Space in Betweent\\"...this was going to be cool.  Mariqueen's voice is soothing and smooth.  The album it's sell if mellow but still packs a wicked punch.    If you like NIN pick this up for sure, don't even hesitate.  Also Congrats to Trent and Mariqueen on their baby who is on it's way.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This is a great story set during the Second Crusade. The directors cut tells a much better story than the original release.
1567184855|5.0|The case studies in this book may not follow strict scientific research guidelines but a message is conveyed with each case. You'll enjoy this book if you have an open mind and believe that the author is simply passing a message to the reader directly from his clients' subconscious and super-conscious memories. The author will from time-to-time give his opinion on certain ideas and notions which are helpful and thought-provoking! Also, the author is extremely clear about the intentions of this book and I never felt like I was being pushed to any particular viewpoint.     Most of the material in this book is uncommon I understand that certain people will be turned-off by the studies and probably write the whole book off as \\"hokey\\". It certainly is a lot to take in especially if you're strongly set in your beliefs.     When you're ready, give this book a read with a clear-head and enjoy it for what it is!
B003O7I6L6|5.0|Okay, I love this movie. Carpenter starting with this movie was on a roll: The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, Starman and They Live. I'm not going to review the film because as stated I LOVE this movie. And though the blu-ray has yet to come out and can't really review the quality of the image and sound. But I just found out today from the website [...] that this is a blu-ray/dvd combo. And...and here is my complaint...all the special features are on the DVD. Nothing is on the blu-ray disc itself. ?. I thought the whole point of blu-ray was it's amazing ability to contain so much more information on one disc over DVD? This is stupid. These blu-ray/dvd combos are absurd though I know why the studios are doing this: to save money. If I wanted a damn DVD I would have never upgraded to blu-ray. At least they could have put the special features on both discs so I could give the DVD to my dad who could give a crap about HD image and sound. Thanks for nothing Fox.
B000QEIORG|2.0|I just bought this album again. I owned it many years ago but lost it when some one broke into my car. I always meant to pick it up again, I had memories of it being a great CD and finding it re-released with bonus songs was a pleasant surprise.    Maybe getting older has helped me appreciate things I once did not have time for, but it has also changed my perspective on a lot of things I enjoyed in my youth. This CD, as with Foo Fighters in general, is only OK, and overrated by many. They have a few hits and singles, but so much of their music is so easily forgettable. I've had all their newer CD's to listen to on our network at work and have never been able to really go through a whole CD. Now going back to this one I can see it was just not as great as I remember. I hate buying single songs, I enjoy owning a whole CD. But if you really do know and enjoy 1 or 2 songs on this CD, just buy the mp3's.
B0012GVKW8|4.0|I'm not going to review the movie since that would be a mute point after over 20 years. You know it, you like it, or you don't. But I will review the blu-ray version of this film on a software level. The main question here is is this an upgrade form the DVD collectors edition or not? And the answer(s) is yes AND no. From an image and sound standpoint the answer is most assuredly yes, This 2007 blu-ray release retains the original film grain from 1987 and that's a good thing. The image is much sharper over the DVD, has more surface detail to images especially in close up and the colors are more natural with detail visible in shadowy areas and very deep blacks. The DVD had a muddy look to it over all and was rather on the soft side. I do however think that this is not a true HD image just an HD scrubbed up DVD image. But still the picture is a marked improvement over the DVD. Sound is real nice if not front heavy. It is DTS-HD and nice and crisp. The original film was only released in Dolby stereo in theaters so maybe Fox tried to stay a bit purist and leave most of the soundscape in the front. NOW the bad news. All the special features that were on the DVD are not on the blu-ray. Why that is I don't know. Netflix and Amazon.com list this as the Collector's Edition. Not so. the only special feature to make it from DVD to blu-ray is the trailer. What you do get is a bunch of other trailers...for other movies. So, if you can live with out the bells and whistles then this upgrade is worth the buy. Now, there is another Predator blu-ray just out called the Ultimate Hunters Edition. This does have all the special features from the DVD and some new ones BUT be warned the image has been super manipulated and noise reduced to the point that all and I mean ALL the original film grain has been scrubbed clean removing with it a lot of small surface detail. Most of the actors faces look like they were cast from Madam Trussard's Wax Museum. And even in close ups. So if you don't care about your film looking like a real film an just can't live without all the special feature swag...pick the new one up. I'm just going to live with my DVD collector's edition until Fox get's it right.are about your film looking like a real film an just can't live without all the special feature swag...pick the new one up.

0891419063|5.0|A compelling and moving story of WWII in the Pacific. I recommend it to anyone who wants to better understand the sacrifices made by the Greatest Generation to preserve our freedoms.

B00004Y6O7|5.0|Although it didn't contain any big hits and was the lowest selling album of the David Lee Roth years, Fair Warning is one of Van Halen's best albums. While its predecessor, Women and Children First, was a party album to be enjoyed by a group of friends, Fair Warning is to be heard when partying alone. The opening \\"Mean Street\\" is the heaviest song the band ever made and still kicks after all these years. This track along with \\"Dirty Movies\\" and \\"Hear About It Later\\" reveal a darker side to the band and the breakdowns in each of these tunes add further to the drama. And when the band go back to their party-hearty anthems on \\"Sinner's Swing!\\" and the singles \\"Unchained\\" and \\"So This Is Love?\\" ,the mood isn't quite as jubilant as before although all the songs rock. \\"Push Comes to Shove\\" represents the song to be played after the party, as it shows the band at their funkiest as well as their more seductive. The one-two punch of \\"Saturday in the Park\\" and \\"One Foot Out The Door\\" continues the drama and ends the album on a desperate note. To me, this is the one VH album that is best when enjoyed in one listen. They never made anything quite this good again although 1984 was close. Highly recommended.
B003IPC5SO|2.0|I have loved Kylie since \\"The Loco-Motion\\". As I grew up, Kylie's music did as well, ever changing, ever evolving to always sound of the moment and timeless at the same time. The first time I played her album, X, I was left breathless--it was the first time I truly loved every track on her album. I felt that the stars had finally aligned and that album was the pinnacle of her career. I couldn't wait to see what came next.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Aphrodite came next. Instead of moving forward musically, this album sounds like a catalog of songs cut from Erasure albums in the early 1990s. The beats and chords (and even lyrics) are so similar that I have a hard time distinguishing between tracks...the annoying blips and bleeps and squeals sound so forced and fake--not the Kylie that I know and love.<br /><br />Please don't let this be your first (or last) Kylie album. The songs on this mess of an album do a disservice to Kylie, not to mention Aphrodite. They both deserve better material than this.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|I saw a few other reviews and saw them mentioning the subtitles and \\"theatrical subtitles\\" soon. Well, on the copy I bought in the store 2 weeks ago had \\"theatrical subtitles\\", so I guess I got that one? I am not sure but I tried the dubbing just to see how it would sound and that lasted about 5 minutes. It was just horrible. I use subtitles anyway but I always want to see how they do the dubbing. Yikes, it was painful.<br />Anyway, I got this movie based on the reviews and how some people had said it was good. I am not big on vampire movies I admit. I am kinda mixed on this movie. I liked it cause it was a different take on vampires (not that the vampire was odd but that the story was not a generic one) but it was a little slow. I am cool with movies that are not all about gore and action but this movie was even a little too slow for me. I didnt get parts of it either and maybe that was the translating? I REALLY didnt get the part where he see's the girl changing and her vagina appears to be sewn up. I even had to go back and slow it down cause I had no idea what I was seeing. I know some cultures do that to girls to keep them chaste but I wasnt sure what relevance it had here. That part threw me for sure. Maybe someone knows what it means, not sure. Wasnt sure about the ending where the kid just ups and leaves with the girl. There were no words spoken really but it was just an odd thing seeing as how he was what? 11? All in all it was a good movie but for those looking for constant gore or lots of action, dont watch this. This is more about friendship and accepting someone as who they are.
1932100385|1.0|The raw data that this book is based upon is hard to get.  Unfortunately, it appears that the Drs. Campbell have an agenda, and left out the information that contradicted the results they wanted.  They left out the bit where the consumption of wheat correlated to a 65% increase in the chance of CVD.  It also ignored entire counties like the Tuoli whose high meat and dairy consumption along with very little plant based foods lead to heath comparable to the more vegan counties.<br /><br />A more complete critique can be found here: [...]  The authors should be ashamed of themselves.

030726999X|4.0|I wondered while reading this if Larsson had fully finished this story before he kicked the bucket. Where 'Tattoo' was perfect, and in my mind 'Girl who Played with Fire' was good, but turned the characters into comic book outlines, 'Hornets Nest' on the other hand was dry and overly analytical.<br /><br />Larsson was an amazingly gifted writer in my opinion. Mostly genre writing like this hovers around simple story lines and characters not fully developed. This isn't a bad thing. Some of my favorite writers like Coben and Francis thrive with such writing styles. Larsson on the other hand is completely the opposite.<br /><br />One of my least favorite tricks that writers use is to jump from one character to the next in order to tell a story. I think it interrupts the flow of the narrative if done to an excessive amount. Few writers can pull it off. I think that larsson did do so with 'Tattoo', but here there is just too much going on. I would not be surprised that if you were to go through the book, you would see that Larsson jumps into the minds of 5 or 6 dozen characters. Its just too much. You loose track of them and its hard to reorient yourself every couple of pages.<br /><br />The writing here is overly dry. Its good, its engaging, but its written like a series of facts lined up one after another. It often felt like Larsson was connecting the dots the way a true crime story such as Zodiac would. Like Larsson had to lay out every single fact for a review rather than for a story where the reader can be allowed the liberty of imagination.<br /><br />What a pleasure it is to have these three books by Larsson in the world. I had a good time reading them, wish there were more.
006145205X|5.0|Matt Ridley has done it. He has written a book that takes a realist's approach at looking toward the future. His findings... it's a heck of a lot better than people are predicting.<br /><br /> True Story. On a recent flight I had the misfortune of sitting next to a white knuckle anarchist. I decided that talking to him during the flight was probably the best way to keep me free from wearing vomit. The anarchist would make statements like, \\"anyone who can not feed their own subsitience deserves to die\\" and \\"The world is so over-populated that we need to blow up the big cities.\\" Obviously, both of these statements are laughable (although scary that someone actually has that view point). What I found that by reciting passages from the \\"The Rational Optimist\\" I was able to offer very CONVINCING arguments against his viewpoints.<br /><br />The Rational Optimist shows us that Self-Sufficiency is a figment of our imagination. Who produces the steel for your shovel? Are you using a tractor... who made it? While engaging in these activities the proprietor would be able to grow their own food (Make steel or farm... you probably do one but not both). The key to our civilization (quite literally) is our ability to specialize in a task and trade those services for something that we are less efficient at doing.<br /><br />Anyhow - that is the premise for the first 250 pages of the \\"Rational Optimist.\\" The remainder shows us why we have cause to be optimistic - here are a couple of examples<br /><br />- Food production - using fertilizers and pesticides we are able to greatly increase the productivity of land. This helps to both feed more people and to save land from deforestation. Organic food made sound enticing, but it will cause millions (if not billions) of people to die of starvation. It will also cause the need for additional farmland - MUCH more farmland. It will require more tractors which increases our need of fossil fuels. In short, organic foods have the markings of an environmental disaster.<br /><br />- Global warming - Higher CO2 levels means that plants grow faster. It also means longer growing season and the likelihood for more rain. This will allow us to save (more) forest land while feeding (more) people.<br /><br />What Matt Ridley has done is to show that through specialization and collaboration mankind has made several significant jumps in technology and economic growth. Why does economic growth matter? The more economic growth the less hungry people are... the less likely they to die from treatable diseases. Roughly 20 years ago the internet became the greatest tool for collaboration that the world has ever known.... If specialization and collaboration are the keys to economic growth and we now have this great tool.... Why shouldn't we be optimistic?<br /><br />Matt Ridley's writing can be a bit dry at times, but this is a very minor detriment. The true strength of the book his methodical approach in building a case that outlines (quite convincingly as my new anarchist friend can attest to) a scenario for a very rosy future.- Global warming - Higher CO2 levels means that plants grow faster.

B002ZG97E2|4.0|I'll be honest- while the commercial spots were pretty cute at first, I grew just as tired of them as most of the other people out there when they played for the millionth time. Even so, I was pretty curious- could this film live up to expectations? And what of the 3-D aspects & the child friendly aspects? More importantly... will the parents wish for a freeze ray to aim at themselves?<br /><br />Steve Carell plays Gru, a supervillain who is determined to make it big. Unfortunately he's hampered by two things: one is the new supervillian Vector who foils Gru at every turn & the other is that in order to undertake his latest venture, Gru must get a loan... which he's almost immediately denied for. Gru attempts to steal a shrink ray to prove to the bank that he's no slouch, but just as it is in his grasp it is stolen by the geeky Vector. Finding no way into Vector's not so secret hideout, Gru decides to sneak his way in via three adorable little girls that he adopts with the intention of discarding once his plan is finished. What he doesn't plan on is actually falling for them.<br /><br />I screened this to see if my niece would enjoy it (ok, I admit it- I was curious) & I was happy to find that the movie is actually pretty cute. The animation is nicely done & I liked Gru's interactions with the kids. Agnes has to be one of my favorite animation kids since watching Boo in Monsters Inc. Who wouldn't giggle at a little girl who mistakes cheese puffs for caterpillars & manages to dye a ferocious dog pink? The story moves along nicely & there's even a little bit of adult humor in there. (If you watch closely there's a little dig at Lehman Brothers early on in the film.) The 3-D is also nicely done- it manages to put in enough cool gimmicks to look impressive, but without overly sacrificing credibility. (Any sight gimmicks are done as part of the plot.) It isn't quite up to par with how Avatar's 3-D was, but let's face it- those are some hard shoes to fill 3-D wise.<br /><br />However where the movie falls short is via the voice talent. Everyone does a decent job, but I can't help but feel like Carell was overdoing it a little with his fake Russian accent & I would have liked to have seen more Kristen Wiig. OK, not exactly a voice talent issue but she was woefully underused in this film. Plus I'm a bit miffed that you basically see most of the best parts of the movie via the commercials & video clips on the web. (Although it might be a good thing- I can watch the \\"IT'S SO FLUFFY!!!\\" scene again without shelling out the bucks to the theater.)<br /><br />The bottom line is that this film is pretty easygoing when it comes to kids & you can rest assured that there's really no objectionable content in this movie. Parents can also breathe a sigh of relief that they'll be just as entertained. If you can, I recommend paying for the 3-D; it's worth seeing it, especially for the end credits where you get to see minion hijinks.<br /><br />This might not be the best kid's film to hit the theaters this summer (nothing can really compete against Toy Story 3), but it is worth seeing.movie falls short is via the voice talent.

0312370849|1.0|I've studied the Holocaust in detail, and I am also an avid reader. This book was terrible on so many accounts.     First, the writing was awful. Although I read it a year ago, I remember the entire book was filled with sentences like \\"I was scared.\\" \\"I was sad.\\" There are too many incredible books to waste your time reading something so poorly written. I'm shocked that it recieved such praise.     The characters were uninteresting. In good books, one should feel like the characters are real people. In this book, the characters were flat and predictable.     In addition, book was cliched and sentimental, trivializing the Holocaust. Read a Holocaust memoir like \\"Survival in Auschwitz\\" or Anne Frank's Diary, not something written by a woman more interested in selling a bad book to the public than really researching the historical events.
B000002LGQ|5.0|During the 80's Madonna had become such an enormous celebrity whose life was on the whim and call of the public. She was seen as a musical entity second and a celebrity stunt woman first and to a degree that has become part of her persona even now. At the end of her first decade however Madonna was intent on letting the world know that musically there was at least AS much artfullness as there was in her public persona. She still wasn't about to make an album that would go over everyones head as some padded vanity project,which is often the case with pop stars just turning 30 or some issue such as that. The way in which Madonna excersises her creativity here is presented in such a way where it's completely relatible in relation to her earlier work. This was beginning to occur on her previous album [[ASIN:B00005J6T0 True Blue]] but it was expanded on in a big way here. Even image wise there's a change. Madonna isn't at this point showing ALL of her body anymore (at least for the moment) and is leaving her hair it's natural brunette,one look of hers I truly enjoyed for the short time it lasted. Three of the hit songs here are the title song,\\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\"-all of which showcase a slightly more direct and elegant outlook on similar types of dance/funk music she'd handled during her days with Nile Rodgers behind the production console. The main difference again is Madonna has grown up a lot since that time and she approches the lyrics with a sense of not only romantic and spiritual longing but realistic minded hesitation. She's not much of an exhibitionist on this album. \\"Love Song\\",co-written and featuring Prince is a very underrated slice of stop and start Minneapolis funk right out of his [[ASIN:B000002LE6 Lovesexy]]-era production that is actually BUILT on a strong sense of personal reservation:do I or don't I? On \\"Promise To Try\\" and the dramatically arranged \\"Dear Jessie\\",with it's multi sectioned parts both have very wistful European classical arrangments and even a hint of the influence of Irish popular music. The reflective ballad \\"Oh Father\\" reveals in a dry eyed way the abuse Madonna apparently received as a child. \\"Spanish Eyes\\" recalls \\"La Isla Bonita\\" although with the latin pop flavor more pronounced than the American radio pop part of it all. \\"Cherish\\" is the other hit and the only song with it's girl group flavor that has a youthful sound on this album,even if again the lyrics are very much about maturity. The album ends with the dense spiritually themed funk of \\"Act Of Contriction\\". Although not carried out musically in quite as focused and innovative a fasion as Prince this could in a word be somthing of the female counterpoint to his [[ASIN:B000002LBM Sign O the Times]] in terms of how it dealt with it's concept: the young adults of the 80's generation finally coming of age.very wistful European classical arrangments and even a hint of the influence of Irish popular music.

This is one of the better ways I have seen tons of research condensed and interpreted very well for the sake of making sense of humans- the oftentimes senseless or irrational.

The materials of this book was very nice to know too.
B002BWP4A6|3.0|Movies don't come much more austere or art-house friendly than \\"The White Ribbon,\\" a German film written and directed by Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke. With its stark black-and-white cinematography and deliberate pacing, the film has the look and feel of an old Ingmar Bergman picture - Ingmar Bergman crossed with M Night Shyamalan, that is, since its story centers around a village in pre-World War I Germany where strange and inexplicable things begin to happen.  The town doctor is injured in a mysterious horseback riding mishap; the baron's son is found hanging upside down in a barn; a worker dies in a freak factory accident.  All of this is narrated by the town's schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) who falls for a sweet, shy girl who works as a nanny at the manor house.<br /><br />The children - most of whom look like they just stepped out of \\"Village of the Damned\\" - struggle with thoughts of death and the guilt caused by a repressive society, while the adults - an emotionally rigid and unyielding pastor, a cruel, incestuous doctor - contend with their own inner demons, as they groan under the burdens of a class-conscious feudal system and the weight of their own conflicted desires.  The theme seems to be that when people bury their natural urges under a crushing mountain of rules and regulations - whether societal or religious in nature - those sublimated urges will manifest themselves in other, demonstrably harmful ways (killing birds, destroying property, kidnapping and torturing children, etc.).  The conclusion we're supposed to come to, I guess, is that it was from just such seeds that the war that was to come would eventually spring. I guess.<br /><br />I wish I could say that I liked \\"The White Ribbon\\" better than I do.  It's certainly wonderful to look at, and there is something haunting and hypnotic about Haneke's vision of life in a small German village at that particular moment in time. But the plotting is so obscure, the pacing so funereal, and the overall demeanor so heavy-handed and pretentious that, I'm afraid, it takes a great deal of patience and perseverance just to get through it all.<br /><br />Still, the mood and visuals alone make it worth the effort.so heavy-handed and pretentious that, I'm afraid, it takes a great deal of patience and perseverance just to get through it all.

0316776963|3.0|\\"Me Talk Pretty...\\" is yet another reason why it's a really bad idea to have inflated expectations about a work of fiction.<br /><br />Well, bad idea for me, anyway.<br /><br />I picked Sedaris shortly after having read an Augusten Burroughs.  That was 4 years ago (I think). Back then, I was optimistic in the hopes of finding another author with that knack for self-mockery coupled with acerbic wit and a distinct lack of care about giving a fig on what others thought. Plus...not coming on as someone who tries to be funny, but...is...just...*is*.<br /><br />Indeed, he doesn't even have to be gay. (I didn't want to think that only gay men can have the monopoly on dysfunctional prose - where would that leave the rest of us poor sods?)<br /><br />Seriously - I thought those expectations of mine were pretty shallow. Bordering on predictable if not totally taken for granted.<br /><br />And so, 4 years (or so) ago, I opened \\"Me Talk Pretty...\\" and braced myself to be swept away by the comic stylings of yet another funny author.<br /><br />Two chapters later and I slammed the book shut. I can't believe it. I was bored.<br /><br />A few years on and it remained shut. And I began to feel miffed with the idea that I may be cheating myself. Who knows? Sedaris' sensibilities may be different from Burroughs'. But that doesn't automatically mean it's bad.<br /><br />So I reread those first 2 chapters, armed with an admittedly sketchy vow to soldier on. No matter what happens. My criteria were still the same. But I held onto them with a markedly less white-gripped tenacity.<br /><br />Sure enough, there were funny moments in this book. 'Jesus Shaves' and 'Picka Pocketoni' I liked. Really liked. There are a few things I love more than indulging in a fantasy wherein other people are as discomfited, neurotic, and hassled as I've been when I was among people who spoke a different tongue.<br /><br />Otherwise, Sedaris' chronicles of his crystal meth days, his stint as a glorified furniture mover and assistant to a volatile South American, and forays into being an inglorious college professor were somewhat negligible. Oftentimes, it felt as if the humor was being forced.<br /><br />There's a sense of affectation particularly when he was in his 'artist' phase - and no amount of excuse as being a drug addict back then may be enough to compensate for the odd behavior expected of someone under the influence. Because, yes, he was odd during his days as a user, but the accompanying exploits were hardly...uhmm...funny.<br /><br />Hence, the 3 stars. Good thing this was bought from a secondhand bookshop. Else I'd be really really depressed. Maybe I'd need another 4 years (or so) before I could give another Sedaris book a try...glorious college professor were somewhat negligible.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|James Cameron has done it again. He made Titanic the highest-grossing movie ever in the 1990s. Now he made this movie to become the highest-grossing movie in the 2000s. The movie is so awesome, especially with its visual effects that will blow you away. Its story is really touching, as it makes you open your mind and eyes to understand the unique culture of the other side.    It's almost the similar metaphor of Native Hawaiians and Americans in Hawai`i. The Native Hawaiians still cherish their traditional language, cultural food, customs, and their rich history that spanned from King Kamehameha the Great to Queen Lili`uokalani. However, back in the 1800s (no offenses here), the Americans stressed to convert the Hawaiian government to switch and comply the American government through agreement with King Kamehameha III, changing the lives of Native Hawaiians, and overthrew Queen Lili`uokalani, which ended the traditional Hawaiian monarchy.    That movie is truly inspiring and touching. I strongly recommend you to rent this first and if you like it, run and buy a copy of this awesome movie!! All I know is that you will hop into a unforgettable journey through Avatar world.

B000RZIGVS|4.0|This is a great series for the kids- generally not too intense (although the Borg freak out one of mine), appropriate language, entertaining and with some interesting themes for family discussion.

B002ZG997C|2.0|'The Book of Eli' has a promising start. We meet Denzel Washington as  Eli walking a post-apocalyse wasteland 30 years in the future very much like the depiction in 'The Road'. He is walking carrying a book that we immediate recognize as the Bible. In case we missed the close-up of the hasped leather bound volume, Denzel gives us plenty of biblical references and quotations.<br /><br />The viewer's suspension of disbelief is  somewhat challenged from the start. Denzel sports shades, odd considering that the planet is shown overcast, grey, dead, and dark. He even wears his sunglasses in dark interior scenes. And unlike Viggo Mortensen in The Road, who literary starved himself to portray the almost dead,skeletal man, Denzel looks pretty good for surviving 30 years of the end of the world. In fact all the characters, except for a couple of cannibals he meets towards the film's last third, look pretty good. If the sunglasses don't amuse you, consider that Denzel also listens to an iPod as he wanders. Not a current iPod but the original iPod. Wow! What a machine to last perhaps 40 years. Steve Jobs needs to use that clip in Apple's advertising.<br /><br />It gets worse. Sunglasses seem to be a readily available commodity in this destroyed future. Everybody has a pair. Yet, the book that has had millions upon millions of copies printed around the world, the Bible, is not to be found except in the hands of Eli. Suspension of disbelief becomes impossible after a while. Perhaps you can rationalize the availability of ammo and gasoline  after 30 years, even mascara and eye shadow, but how do you rationalize that the roadbed still has painted white lines on them? And worse, the entire film after the first 20 minutes, and the exception of the very end of the film, is shot through a brown sepia-tone filter. At least in 'The Road', the Director of Photography found believable realistic looking desolation.<br /><br />Denzels' acting is wooden and uninspired. Luckily, the rest of the cast is quite good, especially Gary Oldman, who carries this film. I wondered if Denzel's acting style in this film was copied from Clint Eastwood's 'Pale Rider'. Often, we the viewers, are just not sure if Eli is truly human. His fighting abilities and accuracy with a pistol at long distances are surely supernatural. Bullets bounce of him, at least in one fight scene, and when he he shot point blank by Oldman, we see a flash of lightning in the sky. Is Eli supposed to be a ghost? Jesus? We are not even sure if he can see or if he is blind.<br /><br />'The Book of Eli' is a well produced film that lifts ideas from other films such as 'The Road', 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome', and 'Fahrenheit 451'. But it ultimately fails. The so-called surprise ending was no surprise at all if you were paying attention. The climax was telegraphed half-way into the movie if you could not guess it from the title itself. And without revealing the ending here, anyone who has worked with the kind of book revealed at the end knows how lame it is to  suggest that the book carried by Eli is the entire King James Bible.<br /><br />UPDATE OF SORTS -<br /><br />I have been asked several times what is wrong with the ending of the film. So here I am revealing the ending. This is a SPOILER. Do not read any further if you don't want to know the answer<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />The book is the Bible in braille. If this was truly the King James Bible in braille it would be about 20 hardbound volumes and take up about 76 inches of shelf space. Not one single book.

B001HN694K|5.0|Twas brillig and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.  Well, here is one good rendition on Lewis Carroll's works. The book was one of our favourites, and still is. Though this is a  newer twist, it still is Wonderland. Darker, maybe, but that is how Carroll's books were too.     This was not too harsh for our daughter, who was entranced with it until the Hatter did a dance on \\"frabjous day,\\" with a bit of rock in the background. The Tweedles were actually quite right. The Hatter is supposed to be mad, and did a good job of it. No other Alice in Wonderland will give you the Jaberwocky as this rendition does. None will give you the Jubjub bird or the frumious Bandersnatch as this one does. The Dodo bird, and others. What else do we say then?     We enjoyed it, even though there were many negative things written about it. Even though we were dubious about it prior to   viewing. We were in for a shocking treat, captivated by it through and through. May or may not be suitable for   everyone, due to some fearful Jaberwocky and other very dark scenes. Then again, your child may like it, as did our nine  year old. Please, read the book. Then you will find the Jaberwocky, Jubjub bird, and Bandersnatch etc. Great job!

B00000064G|5.0|Disc in good shape and of course the music is good, plays with no problems
B000001F76|3.0|For most of the songs the CD is good, but I found one song where it is clear that the remastering has wiped something in the original.  -  about the time that I ordered this CD, I also bought in a shop another CD named \\"the legendary Hank Williams\\" and a few songs are on both the one I bought earlier and on this one, the \\"40 greatest\\".  One of these at least has a very fine high pitched wander on the pedal steel guitar on the \\"legendary.. \\" CD, but this beautiful wander is gone in the remastered version.  Sure the sound appears crisper but also harsher on the remastered CD, but I find it a terrible shame that some of the most beautiful things in the music is just wiped in the aim of having \\"no noise\\", while that only makes the total sound more gritty and gruff.<br /><br />But if I didn't have a copy of the unmastered song, I mightn't have known what was missing,  And even if the sound on this one is harsher, than on the \\"legendary one\\", it is still quite listenable.  My estimate of Hank Williams would not have been as great as it is, because his music has been downgraded by the remastering so that I couldn't hear fully what he created.<br /><br />I'd rather have the 78 noise than all fresh treble and harsher sound with things lost between it.  Such a shame for that  beautiful wander of that pedal steel guitar.  Where else has it happened?  What other beautiful parts to this clever music have they wiped?  Country Music is not just voice and guitar, if it is real music with many many parts, and Hank Williams did it right, made it real.  Sometimes it feels as if much has been lost in the remastering.<br /><br />Get off the knobs and leave well alone when you re record things.  A frequency cannot be wiped without wiping good stuff as well.
B000RZOR2U|5.0|Attractive box -- more colorful than image makes it appear.  Two thick booklets that give overview of Bach's work and performance conditions, and a brief synopsis and review of each and every cantata (but no lyrics).  Generally slower pace on many cantatas than most and boy sopranos throughout -- both can take a bit of getting used to if you are used to faster tempos and larger forces -- but I have grown to really enjoy this style.  My usual gripe is that I wish they arranged the cantatas by week rather than number, but week info is provided in the booklets (although no week by week index).  Glad I bought this.

B001C4AFOY|4.0|Emily Blunt does an excellent job playing Victoria in the years before she became queen and the early years of her reign with her young husband Prince Albert. Rupert Friend does a great job as Albert, a completely genuine fellow who becomes devoted to his young wife. Victoria was the granddaughter of George III and the niece of Kings George IV and William IV, neither of whom had children. She has spent her childhood under the control of her mother, the Duchess of Kent, played well by Miranda Richardson. Unfortunately the Duchess of Kent was under the control of a tyrannical con man, Sir John Conroy, who attempted to dominate both mother and daughter. Mark Strong is frightful in the role of Conroy. Victoria was niece to both the King of England and to the King of Belgium, Leopold. Leopold was a master manipulator and wished to gain influence over his niece. He saw in this young nephew Albert the opportunity to gain this control. However Albert proves to have a mind of his own. Thomas Kretschmann plays the handsome dashing Leopold. Leopold attempt this manipulation through Baron Stockman, Albert's tutor. But Baron Stockman has helped develop a young man of strong character. Albert soon proves himself to be independent of his uncle and the interests of the Kohlberg family and Belgium. When Victoria becomes queen, she has two major advisors. Lord Melbourne, the prime minister, charms her and manipulates her in her youth. The excellent actor Paul Bettany plays Lord Melbourne. He is handsome, brilliant, dashing, sophisticated, worldly, and thus Victoria can be manipulated without knowing she is being manipulated. To Melbourne's credit, he realizes he can not become Prince Albert's rival and advises Victoria to seek her husband's advice on matters of state since he is bright and totally capable and totally devoted to his wife. The dowager queen Adelaide is also an advisor to Victoria, helping her navigate the political land mines of that era. The acting and costumes and settings were superb in this historic drama. The film however has a flaw. The flaw is that too much history was crammed into too short a timeframe. The film would have been a 5 star winner if only 30 minutes were added to the format so that some additional linkage and dialogue could put some of the issues into better context.
B003INJETO|1.0|I really didn't think they could do any worse than \\"Scarsick\\" but somehow Pain of Salvation has managed to do just that.  If, like me, you enjoy their first 4 albums but have lately thought they were heading off into a ditch, avoid this convoluted, horribly produced, slab of junk.  I know, I know, a kid that wasn't even BORN in the 70's wanted to make an album that sounded like a classic 70's album, well, guess what?  He failed.  Utterly and completely.  Sonically, this thing sounds awful.  The songs are, quite frankly, boring.  And lyrics about banging your friend's sister?  Really, Daniel?  REALLY?  I'm now officially OFF the Pain of Salvation bandwagon.  Someone wake me up if they go back to making good music again.
0131479415|5.0|If I am able to implement a quarter of the advice from this book, I will be able to make a significant improvement at my work.  The advice for estimating projects alone is highly valuable, and the pragmatic delivery of the information made it very easy to read and absorb.  The little pieces of easily actionable advice was amazing.  For instance he recommends not concluding iterations near the end of business quarters, and managers are going to need as much revenue as possible at that time and could increase pressure to \\"just get it done.\\"  Very insightful, and the sheer number of \\"ah-ha\\" moments that I experienced was staggering.  Much of the general advice he gave I had heard before, but his ideas for implementation was where this book really shines.<br /><br />I got this book on my Kindle, and then bought a paper copy to loan to peers because I liked it so much.
0780622553|2.0|I love science fiction, but not this movie.  The first few minutes are great.  A man wakes up without a memory.  He is confused and scared.

0061122416|2.0|This book is short and an easy read. It's a metaphorical and philosophical book, but it seemed to me more like a 5th grade read as it is about a young boy searching for meaning and satisfying his curiosity.

B00095NX9G|5.0|This dvd is phenomenal and more than exceeded my expectations. I would classify myself as an advanced beginner. I already had a strong foundation with Ariellah's dvd and Jenna's Belly Dance Basics and Beyond dvd, and while they are more great dvd's, I was beginning to find myself getting bored. Enter Rachel Brice Serpentine!    It's VERY comprehensive. There is enough material on here, to keep the most ADD dancer busy for quite awhile. I won't go through everything thats on the dvd, as it's already been mentioned. But I will say that since working with this dvd, I've already seen major improvements in my flexiblity and dance!    As far as the level of this dvd, I believe that ALL levels can do this dvd. I would say that a very MOTIVATED beginner could definitely use this dvd, provided that they have taken A dance class before. Obviously if you've never ever done belly dancing, than you may find this challenging as you would any belly dancing dvd, I suppose. But I definitely think Rachel does a phenomenal job at making this dvd accessible to those just starting as well as the more advanced dancer. I'm surpised at myself that I'm actually able to do some of the choreography, no doubt I can only credit Rachel Brice and her drill section portion of the dvd because of this. She has a very good way of breaking down choreography in that it's not too slow (for advanced) but not too fast (for beginner's to get).    What made me a true believer, was that since purchasing this dvd, I've gotten other bd dvd's that left much to be desired. The production quality and content weren't nearly as up to par as Serpentine. It's definitely in a class all it's on.     All I have to say is make the investment. Where else are you going to get tons of drills, TWO choreographies, a thorough warm up and leg streghtening, tips for weekly practice, lecture and yoga for backward bending and all for under $23 bucks?! No where I'm sure. The only thing that could possibly make this dvd better, is if Rachel were to be wrapped in the package herself. Now I\\"m gushing, but I'm sure you guys get the idea.    Bravo Rachel, now I see why you really truly are the queen of modern tribal fusion!
0307474712|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years.  What's amazing is how it's by turns both laugh-out-loud funny (and I NEVER laugh out loud when reading) and, in the end, deeply moving.  What's especially astonishing is how, while it's a quick, easy read (I raced through it in a day and a half), it's also no less profound for being eminently readable.  The last page and last lines, especially, move beyond funny or sad and are simply transcendent, hugely resonant.  If you're one of the few reviewers who is depressed by this book then I think you may not have left yourself open to the (dare I say?) cosmic lift-off David Nicholls miraculously leads us to.  In the end, for all its playfulness, wit and fun, this is a very big book.

Although a couple of songs are kind of sad most of the songs are upbeat enough to lift your spirit. Also, with a cast like this, it's bound to be good anyway.  Another thing that should impress is the actors and actresses did their singing. That's nothing to be taken lightly.
B002MJV75O|5.0|The episodes that change lives. Dawson's Creek will go down as an all timer in teen angst and intellectually insane dialogue heavy heavy thinking melodrama. Amen to that. Only problem?

0767903862|4.0|I almost forgot how much fun it is to read books about foreign countries and cultures. As soon as opened In a Sunburned Country, memories of reading travelogues about U.S. rushed back to me. Oh, how amazed I was those years ago to learn that apparently many Americans put their T-shirts on to swim in the pool and wear extra underwear underneath their swimming trucks (I am originally from one of those speedo countries) or that to go to a school dance you just have  to have a boy-friend who is obligated to bring you a corsage or that American toilets already have water in them so that when you... no, I am not going to elaborate on this one.<br /><br />What I am getting at is that Bill Bryson's book about Australia is full of entertaining facts like that plus more - he also introduces a lot of information about history of Australia, its landscape, nature, etc. Basically, tons of information for us, people completely unfamiliar with this distant country, to finally learn something, anything about it beyond what's written in The Thorn Birds.<br /><br />What especially stood out for me:<br /><br />1) Australia in fact was originally forcefully populated by criminals from England.<br /><br />2) The country/continent is a dangerous place where you can expect to be poisoned by any insect and jelly fish or eaten by a crocodile.<br /><br />3) Australians love building big things in the shapes of other things - Big Lobster, for instance.<br /><br />4) How Aborigines found their way to the continent of Australia tens of thousands years ago is still a mystery and they weren't even considered people worthy of being mentioned on Australian census up until 1970s.<br /><br />5) Non-whites weren't allowed to immigrate to Australia until the same 1970s.<br /><br />... and much much more.<br /><br />All in all, Bill Bryson succeeds in drawing a comprehensive picture of Australia, a vast, unexplored, beautiful, dangerous, young, distant country with some unattractive spots in its past (and maybe present).d maybe present).

0062009540|4.0|Okay, I'm hooked. I started watching the TV show when it first came out, and liked it well enough. So I decided to see how the book series would compare.<br /><br />This book follows a former group of friends three years after their leader, Alison, went missing. Now they are getting mysterious text messages from a person known only as \\"A\\". \\"A\\" knows secrets only Alison knew and trust me, these girls have plenty of them. Despite being only 16, these girls have more skeletons in their than the cast of \\"Desperate Housewives\\". The girls have to comfront secrets from their past while dealing with their issues of the present.<br /><br />I liked this book perhaps more than I'm willing to admit. Its a guilty pleasure read for sure. The girls are each different and have their own personalities. Aria is the \\"free spirit\\" who holds the secret of her dads affair, while trying to hide a tryst of her own. Emily is the chaste jock who is questioning her sexuality and overall personality. Hanna is the new queen bee desperate to stay ahead. And Spencer is the competive over-achiever who is fruitlessly trying to please her parents.<br />I liked all of the girls, despite their faults. But I did remain unattached from them through out the book. The plot is full of twists and turns and I have absolutely no idea what will happen next.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether or not I like the TV show or book series more. While they obviously have similarities, they have their fair share of differences, and I think they might be going in different directions. So as of now, I like them both.<br /><br />Next installment please!

B002ZG98LO|4.0|\\"Predators\\" is back to basics return for the \\"Predator\\" franchise, they have juggled the elements that made the first film successful but couldn't seem to get right for the sequel or the \\"Alien vs. Predator\\" movies. \\"Predators\\" starts with the original premise of the first movie. Eight people of different ethnicities (if not occupations) are thrown into a living green hell of a jungle except they all don't know how they got there or where they are. The only thing they're sure of is that they were involved in some war, they saw a light and the next thing they remember is waking up as they fell into the jungle.<br /><br />As the eight get to know each and their surroundings, \\"Predators\\" relies on the camaraderie of the individuals and the stress of the situation for each character to reveal themselves to each other and the audience, and they discover every one may not be what they seem. There's also a nice bit of gallows humor to lighten the moments and was one of the things that gave the original \\"Predator\\" some of it's charm.<br /><br />The predators have some new toys including the spiky dogs, and we learn there are two different kinds of predators, the standard one we're used to seeing is the smaller of the species and are hunted by the larger super-predator when no other game is available.<br /><br />One bit of casting I was worried about was Topher Grace, the geeky Eric Forman of \\"That 70's Show,\\" he seemed miscast or ill fitted for Eddie Brock in \\"Spiderman 3,\\" and here he's the one element that doesn't fit, but he isn't supposed to, and he looks right for the part and delivers a role that at first looks like a straightforward but has some twists. Laurence Fishburne does a near-cameo as Noland, a soldier marooned on the planet and who may be from the Vietnam era, I think he hums a bit of Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" used to such great effect in Apocalypse Now.<br /><br />I at first thought \\"Predators\\" was directed by Robert Rodriquez and that was one of the reasons I was looking forward to seeing the movie. I was a little disappointed that Rodriquez only produces, but this movie does incorporate some of the feel of a movie directed by Rodriquez but that may be because \\"Predators\\" is based on a screenplay Rodriguez wrote sixteen years ago . Directing is Nimrod Antal and he moves the movie tautly along never veering off course or too far off course, and he does add some visual artistry that hasn't been seen in any of the previous movies but gives us a sense of the alieness of the world the characters find themselves trapped on.<br /><br />\\"Predators\\" is conscious of the events of the first \\"Predator\\" movie and the climatic battle is a tweaked version that is an homage to Arnold's battling of the predator while building on some of the inferred weaknesses of the predators. \\"Predators\\" is a good telling of a \\"Predator\\" story, using bits of the original and adding its own devices to the \\"Predator\\" mythology.o seeing the movie.

0812548094|3.0|I like Goodkind, the next book after this is good and his first was top notch.   This novel is about 500 pages of painful dreck, for example. Richard will go on for pages about how much he misses Kahlan and Kahlan will in turn do the same thing. I understand they are deeply in love but you don't need to beat that dead horse anymore, I got the first hundred times it was irritatingly mentioned.    Secondly, the main problem of the novel is wrapped up in the last 50 pages.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|The first season of Mad Men is amazing!  If you have come across any of the shows on AMC and are looking for how it all began than this is the DVD set for you.  I started watching one night, and ended up staying up for four episodes late into the night.  The acting is superb and the storyline is complex but easy for the audience to follow.  Most of all the setting in the 1960's is so very different from today. This is evident by the clothes, actions, and set design; yet the emotions and conflicts of then are still very present and relevant to 2010.  A must see!

B0015DROBO|5.0|I enjoyed this novel immensely.  There isn't a lot of Swedish literature out there, so it was interesting to see things from a different cultural point of reference.<br /><br />The novel moves quickly and you find yourself rooting for the anti-hero of Salandar.  She's an odd character, but the more you read the more her actions make sense.  She's the anti-Bella; unlike the female character in Twilight she's willing to do whatever it takes to get what she needs.  She a strong person with a different way of doing things, but she always seems to do the right thing even when she's been betrayed by society.<br /><br />If you like mysteries, this book has an old mystery that has gone unsolved for decades.  It's hard to put the book down, since you'll want to find out what happened to Harriet and you won't want to wait to get the answer.<br /><br />Once you start this novel you'll want to read the other two in the series.  The second book was quite good, but I found that the final novel wasn't quite as exciting and fast-paced as the first two.  I did enjoy the intertwined plot lines that were woven throughout all three books - they should definitely be read in order.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I just finished reading the newest Nora Roberts book, The Search. It was fantastic. I just can't get enough of her storytelling. I read anything that has been written by her because I trust that it will be a great story with great conversation between the characters and I never worry that I will be left feeling bad or sad. Not everything is rosey in the lives of these characters but she makes us know those trying periods in their lives made them who they are at the setting of the story without making us go through the grieving of the terrible event. Instead we are laughing at the conversations between the characters and feeling the suspense of the story.     The only thing that makes me sad is that I am almost finished reading everything that Nora has written and now I am left waiting for her new releases. I am left missing Eve and Roarke and all the other characters that she has introduced to me from Irish Thoroghbred to The Search. Thank you Nora for your unbelieveable storytelling that leaves me laughing out loud!!!!!
B0000640VO|4.0|Amelie is a waitress in a Montmarte cafe.  She is painfully shy, but has an impish sense of humour.  One day she finds a box hidden behind a baseboard in her apartment - full of little toys and pictures, obviously belonging to a little boy.  She tracks down the boy (now a 50-year-old man) and anonymously gives him the box.  His obvious joy at finding these childhood treasures, and his vow to look up his estranged daughter, inspire Amelie to embark on a life of do-gooding.  Thus, the life-affirming and very charming film Amelie is underway.    The joy of Amelie lies not only in the story, but also how it effortlessly evokes a place (Paris's Montmartre district) and a feel.  The cimematographer artificially ramps up the colour to give a lush, bright, and cheerful film to match the quirky and charming events of the film.  Few films make such good use of location (it is revealed in the director's commentary, for example, that both the sex shop and grocery are within walking distance of the director's own apartment).  Sacre Coeur Cathedral is featured in one scene, but it is not emphasized - it's just part of the landscape.    Doubtless some jokes are lost in translation, but even this subtitled version is full of funny jokes.  Few are laugh-out-loud Simpsons-esque jokes to be sure, but you're likely to have a smile on your face throughout.  Tatou is brilliant in her portrayal of the titular heroine, and the rest of the cast also rise to the occasion.  I especially like her relationship with the eccentric painter who lives in a nearby apartment.  In analyzing the Renoir he is copying, she and he also analyze her life, leading to some of the most moving moments in the film.    Many reviewers call this a perfect romantic movie.  While I don't agree - the characters are all so quirky that it gets a little tiresome, and there is a rediculous \\"misunderstanding\\" that only serves to draw the conclusion of the film out for no good reason (and making the film 15 minutes too long).  But it is very good and fun for all adult ages and both genders (English viewers might be taken aback by the seemingly random and casual insertion of nudity/sex at certain points, but this is such a typically French attitude that, for me, it adds positively to the evocation of time and place).    There are some nifty extras.  Of most interest is the technical featurette that details the location shooting and the cinematographer's work.  The director Jeunet is actually quite funny in English as well as French, and the Q&A session at an American university is also quite fun (especially when he shoots down a questioner who makes the mistake of mentioning the French New Wave: \\"New? That was 40 years ago!\\")
0399156577|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The hero was different and I loved the dogs.  It was a good seriel murder book but had a lot of places to laugh, which really made the book for me.  And thank God this author uses plot and action rather than taking up space with pages and pages of detailed sex scenes.

B000F8O2OM|5.0|I bought the thin packs after reading all the reviews about the collectors edition ( all ten seasons ). According to the reviews a lot of these disks were getting scratched due to the poor storage system of the collectors edition. The Thin packs are packaged extremely well and I have not found this to be an issue...however the thin packs are more expensive..( you get what you pay for )You can take a chance and order the collector edition ( Amazon has a good record for refunding this item...too bad they haven't fixed the problem ) or spend more for a quality item, I opted for the second option.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Although my favorite Sherlocks are Jeremy Brett & Basil Rathbone, Rober Downey, Jr. gets high accolades from me in his own right.  The acting approach is entirely different.  We had the presence to put on English subtitles and were able to much better understand all the dialog.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|The first episode grips you so hard you think you've traveled in time. FF does a great job showing the global totality of such an event -- not an easy feat for TV. Great characters, plenty of development. Though it stalls at times in early episodes, everything is just setting up for a masterful drive to the second half of the series. These episodes currently are airing on Hulu. The complete season comes out in August and is a must have.
B003E6K1VK|4.0|I was the definition of skeptical when it came to this product, and indeed the idea of needing a headphone amp altogether. Even though I'm a musician of almost 10 years, I figured modern computer equipment and mp3 players are good enough at providing power and definition, or else they wouldn't be so popular or well-rated. I thought this item was going to be a quick return after realizing it didn't do much. I'm very happy to say I was wrong.     First and foremost, the audio part. It really does even out the sound! Any 'loud spots' that your equipment had before, like maybe the hi-hats were harsh due to an overly prominent tweeter, or some filtered voice in music was too resonant and kind of annoying with headphones (both of these being things I personally experienced), this smooths that out and gets rid of those loud spots. It's the kind of thing you don't notice was wrong with your equipment until it gets fixed. It also gives a little more definition and resolution to music that I didn't hear before, even with my reference speaker system. I couldn't believe how quickly I noticed the difference. Now I will say, the difference isn't nearly as big as, say, upgrading to better speakers or headphones would be. That would provide better definition, a better and roomier soundstage, more even distribution of volume, and multiple other things all in one shot. But something like this, for about half or a quarter of the price of a real speaker upgrade, does make a significant improvement.    Onto the features. I really love the bass boost option. It provides a very high-quality boost and makes my speakers and headphones pump out clean, tight bass that I didn't think they were previously capable of. If you like the option to thump one minute, and hear music more 'accurately' the next, this is the perfect option for you. The '3' option for bass boost, the highest this DAC goes, seems to at least double the decibel level of the bass, and again in a very clean way (not boomy). This DAC was also instantly recognized in Ubuntu Linux as an external USB DAC/Soundcard, and I could immediately output music to it. I noticed an improvement in quality over my onboard audio immediately, and my onboard audio is a pretty decent RealTek series. Of course, though, onboard audio has never been considered the pinnacle of high-fidelity -- though this DAC might be! It's also beautiful to look at, made very well and the screen is very readable and nice.    Now, why did I rate it 4 out of 5 stars? It's certainly not for the audio quality. It's mainly due to the price and the (lack of) features. You get a lot of quality in a tiny package, but for a burgeoning audio expert and not one who devotes paychecks at a time to the hobby, the $100 pricetag is a little hard to swallow. I had to see what all the fuss was about so I bit the bullet and I'm glad I did, but I think a uni-tasker like this should be a bit cheaper. As far as the features go, I would have really liked more modeling options. The bass boost is definitely awesome, but that's the only extra feature you have with this DAC. I would have liked possibly a full 10- or 20-band EQ (even though, in all honesty, I probably wouldn't use it as this DAC provides great equalization as it is), or some stereo separation features. Maybe even some filters if I want to use it for mixing. But the bass boost, being an external PC sound card, AND a headphone amp, makes me still feel like I got my money's worth.    If you don't mind paying $100 and you need both the external sound card and headphone amping options, this is a no-brainer and needs to go in your shopping cart immediately!

B0002F6AH0|5.0|In a society that's been prosperous and mostly safe for decades, it's easy to lose sight of the depths of violence and depravity that are possible in humankind. This is a great antidote to that problem. In this series, you will see battle after battle that's horrific: Poland, Battle of Britain, Stalingrad, the Italian campaign, D-Day, Battle of the Bulge, and many, many more. You'll see the gruesome details of Hitler's drive to Holocaust, and in fact those episodes are probably the hardest to watch in the series. They are gritty, real, and terribly, terribly tragic.<br /><br />It's also important to realize the value of standing up to those whose main motivation is attainment of raw power. As horrific as WWII was, this video series begins far enough in advance of the war that you can see the paths not taken, which would have frozen Hitler in his tracks before he gained the territory, resources, and confidence of the German people to launch a war that killed a hundred million people. Those who always believe in the magical power of negotiation need to see the vivid proof that it isn't always the answer. Sometimes standing up to thugs is a painful but necessary alternative, no matter the cost.<br /><br />WWII was too big to get even into a series this long. I find the war in the Pacific gets short shrift, which is probably not surprising from a British production company. Britains own trevails get a deeper look. But those are minor flaws.<br /><br />They don't take away from the virtues of the production: lots and lots of real video shot during the war, detailed interviews with survivors on both sides, and a well-written narration by the incomparable Laurence Olivier, who puts forth the exact tone needed, mostly tragic, but other times matter of fact or even occasionally whimsical.<br /><br />I had my teen sons watch this when they were around 13 and again a few years later. I know of no better resource that simultaneously illustrates both the horror of war and the regrettable necessity of some wars because the alternatives are even worse. I watched it with them both times, making that three viewings for me counting the one when it originally came on TV. It's worth it.because the alternatives are even worse.

Besides, I have an antique tractor!
1594488916|4.0|To introduce the synopsis of The Man Who Loved Books too Much, I just want to ask a few questions. What lengths would you to in order to obtains books? Would you steal? I know most of you would not, we love books too much to violate them like that. The main person profiled in this book is John Gilkey. Gilkey was so obsessed with books, he would go to incredible lengths to steal them.<br /><br />To me, Gilkey was reprehensible. I felt he was something of a sociopath, in that he had no remorse about his actions. He felt the rare book dealers were out to get him, because they had all of the rare books he wanted. Honestly, that's messed up. To me, stealing books is just wrong.<br /><br />I felt this was a fascinating read. It started off pretty slowly, but as soon as we meet Sanders, the literary \\"detective\\" who was after Gilkey, the book got interesting. It was pretty hard to put down. I know, that's a surprise and all, since this was non-fiction, but it was pretty decent non-fiction. I thought it was interesting that she placed books in the context of objects, and not as stories or ideas. Personally, I like the idea of books as sentimental objects, we all have that one tattered copy of a childhood favorite hovering on our bookcases, don't pretend you don't, either. However, I don't think I would purchase a book just to own it, with no intention of ever reading it (reading it when I'm 30 does count). I thought it was pretty pathetic that Gilkey only cared about his library to impress others. I feel like books are meant to be read, not meant for objects of display or to impress people. Certainly, I understand collecting books, because you love reading. I have a few antique books myself (1916 edition of Treasure Island; 1906 edition of A Tale of Two Cities), collecting is wonderful. But stealing rare books to impress someone, that's just wrong!<br /><br />I know, with that rant you probably think I didn't enjoy this book, but I really actually did. I loved learning about rare book collectors and Sanders. While reading this book, I suggest you retire to the library with some brandy and cigars, ha ha. Not the public library mind you, do not walk in there with brandy and cigars.d Sanders. While reading this book, I suggest you retire to the library with some brandy and cigars, ha ha.

0312370830|4.0|I started this book and could not put it down.  It was painful to read, and I cried over and over as I was reading about what happened to Sarah's family.  The subject was dealt with beautifully, and many of the characters will be unforgettable.  As the novel progresses, and Sarah's voice is no longer heard, it became very ordinary.  The story was very predictable and the writing was lackluster.  Had it not been for the incredibly emotional and strong start, this would have been a clinker.  But it's worth it to read about what happened in one of the world's most shameful incidents.
B002UNMWAG|3.0|The foul mouthed, wise-cracking, whiskey drinking, Irish-Catholic vigilante brothers are back! The story begins with the MacManus brothers in hiding with their dear old assasin dad. Word comes that a beloved priest back in Boston, has been killed by the mafia to bring the brothers out of hiding. Well, it works! They return and mount a violent and bloody assault against all those responsible. However, while the brothers exact their revenge, dad must deal with a devil from his past!<br /><br />This is an enjoyable sequel. It sure is fun seeing the brothers back and doing what they do best! The acting could have been a bit better, but Julie Benz is a fun watch. The movie lacks the originality of the first, which takes away from this shoot 'em up style revenge flick. Gratuitous violence indeed. A guilty pleasure, I guess.<br /><br />BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A sharp and wonderful picture. A lot of this film takes place at night and that is where the power of Blu lies. The blacks are sharp and clear! The audio mix is also boombastic! SPECIAL FEATURES: Enjoyable and interesting. FINAL VERDICT: A MUST OWN FOR FANS!
B003NX76BM|3.0|I enjoyed this book. The dogs were great, the training tips were spot on, and I enjoyed the main characters. I have read all of Ms. Roberts books, and the last few years have not loved really any of them. Interesting to see how search and rescue works.  If your looking for suspense, this is not it.  Romance was light, but enjoyable.  Wait for the paperback... Not worth hardcover or Kindle price.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|Our story takes place in the present, where the gods of Mount Olympus are fighting with each other. Zeus' Lightning Bolt has been stolen! He charges the son of his brother Poseidon as the thief. Zeus issues a warning that if the Bolt is not returned in 14 days an all out war will ensue that will destroy the Earth! Now Percy finds himself caught between angry and battling gods, he and his new found friends must embark on a quest to catch the true lightning thief and save Percy's mom from Hades!<br /><br />That is the story in a nutshell! The problem here lies in the way the story is rushed along. This is a story about Greek Mythology which is so rich in history. In order to achieve a reasonable runtime, character and plot development are really thrown out you in waves (pun intended). They seem sacrificed to get to the great CGI action sequences. Very little explanation or none is given as to why Percy is considered the thief or how he learns to fight and use his powers so well. These are things that hurt the overall story and give it a 3 star mark. Please, don't get me wrong. This is still a very enjoyable movie, just lower your expectations.<br /><br />BLU RAY THOUGHTS: This is a gorgeous disc. The picture is very strong with a wonderful audio mix. The cgi action sequences will blow you away. A special effects feast! SPECIAL FEATURES: You get some deleted scenes and a mixed bag of extras which are ok. FINAL THOUGHTS: Fans of the books and/or fantasy, this is a MUST OWN.
0800177177|1.0|When my girl talked me into seeing this again after fifteen years, I thought it couldn't be as bad as I remembered.  I was wrong; it's worse.  This film sets a unique standard of badness, its own definition of \\"awful,\\" with mistimed direction, hackneyed performances, cheesy physical design, and disdain for its source.  I cannot recall a film this bad that wasn't directed by Ed Wood, Jr.    To start, the images are almost unwatchable.  The entire movie is visibly shot on a sound stage, with elaborate landscapes encompassed in matte paintings obviously done on deadline.  This gives \\"ancient\\" stone castles and English manor houses a wobbly quality that wouldn't pass muster on [[ASIN:B000QGDJGK Dark Shadows]], and sets the horizon laughably close to the camera on outdoor shots.  The look resembles somebody's design class final exam.    The major actors evidently had no time to find their characters.  Keanu Reeves, who had a good fake accent in \\"Dangerous Liaisons,\\" sounds like a Renaissance Faire dropout.  Winona Ryder looks less like Mina Murray than a fangirl playing Ryder's character in [[ASIN:B001AGXEAG Beetlejuice ]].  And Gary Oldman acts with a wink to the camera, like he knows what a dog-o-rama he's trapped in.    I get glimmers of hope from the supporting cast.  Richard E. Grant and Tom Waits show glimpses of real human clarity which they must have snuck in while the director wasn't looking.  But Cary Elwes and Bill Campbell are interchangeable place-holders waiting for a story.  Sadie Frost's Lucy has what might pass for sexual intensity from a 14-year-old virgin.  And Anthony Hopkins' Van Helsing isn't too tightly wrapped; someone should have warned him that he wasn't playing Hannibal Lector anymore.    Director Francis Ford Coppola notoriously wanted no optical effects, shooting everything the old fashioned way, in front of the camera.  It's an interesting conceit, but paired with ill-designed sets, this film looks like an old Star Trek episode.  For me, theemblematic scene shows Gary Oldman in makeup as a wolf-bat-ape-man-thing, feeding on Sadie Frost in a way that resembles oral sex.  The image elicits not terror but laughter.    James V. Hart's screenplay, meant as a TV movie (and we can tell), languished for fifteen years until Ryder needed a star vehicle and Coppola needed to prove he could still return films on time and under budget.  This mess doesn't just take liberties with the novel; it slaughters its source.  This feels like a Dracula parody, except that it plays in such pathetic earnest.    Stoker's novel is a pioneering masterwork of psychological horror.  It uses dramatic irony to emphasize Dracula's devolutionary decay behind his genteel exterior.  It hints at the rot growing in the heart of the British Empire.  It shows how a good man can be corrupted by evil that comes with a smile.  But Coppola would rather hit cheesy \\"BOO\\" moments and use chintzy camera tricks to conceal that he doesn't understand this complexity.    And the pacing is atrocious.  The movie caroms back and forth between scenes so fast that it feels like we're trapped in Act I until the final minutes of Act III.  The actors don't connect with the settings or with each other.  This sprawling, ill-conceived mess looks more like a school play than a film from an Oscar-winning director.    Bad movies have unique charm, bad horror movies doubly so, so I understand why some people like this mess.  But lush costumes and an all-star cast cannot conceal the awful mulligan stew of this film.  If you want a good low-rent vampire film, go rent [[ASIN:B0026JI1RW Near Dark]] again.  This lousy film deserves its own clause in the Geneva Convention.
B001HN69AY|4.0|If you directed a film that didn't stop to explain itself, wouldn't your first priority be to ensure the actors practiced good elocution?  I had to watch this movie with the subtitles on because the characters wouldn't stop mumbling.  I really enjoy this movie, and think it could be the shot in the arm which creatively bankrupt Hollywood needs, but I wish the actors would speak up.<br /><br />Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) claims to be millennia old, and will impart his wisdom to anyone who steps through his sideshow mirror.  But even with his lovely daughter Valentina (Lily Cole) and assistant Anton (Andrew Garfield), he can't interest the modern world in his chintzy vaudeville show.  That is, until charming Tony (Heath Ledger) stumbles into their lives.  But what secrets does Tony hide, waiting to be revealed beyond the magic mirror?<br /><br />This film got more publicity for Heath Ledger's death than for its own high quality, which is a shame.  Its fluid, dreamlike structure and surrealistic imagery, a common trait of director Terry Gilliam, makes it less a conventional studio movie than an experience, like river rafting.  You lie back and see where it takes you.  And where it goes is right into the heart of the human soul.<br /><br />Plummer and Ledger prove to have remarkable comedic timing, playing off one another like few teams since Abbott and Costello.  Former model Lily Cole proves to be more than just eye candy.  And Tom Waits plays an exaggerated version of his own public persona in the role of the Devil.  Importantly, they don't let their performances get overshadowed by the dazzling visual effects.<br /><br />If you've seen Gilliam's classic \\"Brazil,\\" you won't be surprised by the stream-of-consciousness story that weaves in on itself without coming to a neat resolution.  It's smart and demanding, and it leaves you with plenty to think and talk about after the film.  I could wish the actors spoke a little clearer, but this film sweeps viewers along, astound our senses, and leaves us clean at the other end.eaves us clean at the other end.
0981951244|5.0|The world was never easy.  Somehow during this economy, we feel like have never been 'there' before.  We have.  There were inspirational leaders during those times who are 'leaders of leaders' if you will.  Maybe you read Jim Rohn in the 70's, in the 80's and 90's you added Tony Robbins.  As Billy Joel said, \\"we didn't start the fire\\".  It was never easy.    Well, what if you had a mentor influenced by these important figures, who through sheer passion  was able to become a multi millionaire in his mid twenties?  And he continues to be successful in our 'troubled times' And what's even better is that he appears to be as nice a guy as you might ever meet.  To good to be true, you say?  Check out The Compound Effect, by Darren Hardy to see the psychology behind how he did it.      Now, I realize I am throwing it on heavy here, I am not on the payroll.  I am passionate high school and college teacher with an entrepreneurial spirit; I have seen my high school and college kids be successful for YEARS using these principles.  Darren simplifies them in a cohesive fashion, but keeps you accountable.  No get rich quick stuff here, its got the goods.  People who have read 100's of leadership books will still get much from this work.    The book includes details of how to foster discipline in your life.  Some personal development books are inspirational, but lack detailed points about \\"how they did it\\".  When I read the book, I had the feeling that Darren was a personal coach.  The style is accessible in that way.     I have spent hours reading Tony Robbins, Jim Rohn and now books like The Compound Effect, and it has made a world of difference in my ability to teach and growth my small businesses.  Night and day in 6 years.  Buy The Compound Effect because it will change your life.  I see the change in the eyes of my students everyday.      As my two year old once said, \\"Let's do this.\\"  I hope you are as inspired as I was by this great book.

Donnie Yen has the best form in martial arts I've ever seen! Don't believe me, check out Iron Monkey the Japanese version and you'll understand why I stress this. This is no pop-corn candy coated kung-fu fighting, this is superb Martial Arts executed on film.

0439023483|5.0|I'm always looking for my new favorite book to recommend.  I love original story lines and I don't discriminate with my book genres - I love them all!  I bought this book because People magazine recommended it as one of their top picks for the year and they described it as, \\"Twilight for males.\\" I'm not a guy but I tend to like books that guys like, too, so I decided to go for Hunger Games.  I loved the Twilight series, despite the fact that I read them when I was 26/27 and am not a teenager.  Having read Hunger Games, I'm not sure that I would put it in the same grouping as Twilight.  It's more like Ender's Game (great book) meets 1984/Brave New World.      I love the 2 books in the series so far because the characters are so original and engaging, the story is really original, and there are so many exciting twists and turns that I literally don't know what to expect in the 3rd book, Mockingjay.  All I know is that I absolutely CAN'T wait for Mockingjay.  I already gave Hunger Games to my dad to read and he tore through book 1 and 2 so quickly and is eagerly anticipating the 3rd book as well.  Awesome book!

B000FA57RG|4.0|I have to say I wasn't expecting much - at this particular time in her career, I wasn't particularly happy with \\"American Life.\\" Nonetheless, this is a pretty good set. I'm usually never particularly happy with live cd's, esp when I already have the original versions, but given what Madonna does w/ the arrangements it's always interesting, so I can't argue w/ that. The dvd was definitely worth the purchase. It is NOT by any means another \\"Truth or Dare\\" but when you put this up against the earlier movie, it's very interesting to see the change in the woman, both physically and spiritually, especially when you see her with her family. One thing I've done recently (as I've done some serious spring cleaning over the last few months) is watch all of her concerts from her earliest to her latest. You should try it sometime. It's amazing to see how much Madonna has grown musically; become comfortable in her own skin - and how it flows thru to her audience & those working with her.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Tough to give a \\"glowing\\" review for cables.  They're what you expect, or at least should expect.  Seem to be pretty solid construction.  They connect from point \\"A\\" to \\"B\\".  If you need this type of cables, these are a good buy.
0143038419|4.0|I avoided this book for years because of the word \\"pray\\" in the title.  I'm not religious, and I simply assumed this book would have a heavy religious tone that I was in no way interested in experiencing.  It wasn't until a friend recommended it, said I would like it, and showed me the trailer for the movie that is coming out in a month that I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I truly liked this book.  It opened up my eyes and made me really think - and I love when a book has that effect on me.  It's the story of a 30-something woman who leaves her real life behind (failed marriage, depression) and spends the year traveling between Italy, India, and Indonesia.  Ultimately she's embarking on a trip of self-discovery and the journey is an honest and heartfelt story of how she manages to find balance and fulfilment where she least expects it.<br /><br />I found Elizabeth Gilbert increadibly relatable, witty, and likeable.  I can honestly say that I enjoyed the Italy & Indonesia sections of the book more than I enjoyed the India section, but that's just my personal opinion.  It made me want to throw caution to the wind and launch my own spiritual journey across the world!  I'm glad that I gave this book a chance, despite my initial aversion and now I can't wait for the movie!
0810993139|5.0|OMG, if you have not read Diary of A Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney, and have an hour to spare, I suggest you pick up this book. The main character is Greg, he's the middle child with two brothers, and one best friend whom he doesn't seem to like all that much. He's funny, he likes the ladies, he wants to be popular. Sound like your typical middle schooler!<br /><br />Diary of a Wimpy Kid contains simple drawings, the art is not perfect. However, it is a fast read and a silly romp recommended for a stressful day. It is not the book for someone who wants a deep meaningful read. I guess some people may dislike this book because Greg isn't a role model. In fact, he's self-serving, lazy, and kind of a jerk. Personally, I think he is the typical middle schooler. Aside from all of those terrible qualities, he's actually quite funny.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was the cheese touch, where this one kid touches a piece of months old moldy cheese, and then has the cheese touch so people try to avoid him so they don't get cheese touch either.
075697237X|2.0|It was a good first book to the series but if it wasn't for the romance it would have nothing pulling it forward in my opinion...I guess I feel it was a shallow read.
0547258305|5.0|Graceling by Kristin Cashore exudes awesome. It just pours off of each and every single page. In the world within Graceling there are seven kingdoms. Each of these kingdoms are ruled by royalty. Within this world certain people are graced. Being graced means you are exceptionally talented at something. Katsa, the main character, is graced as an assassin. She's essentially a BAMF. (see Dane Cook for explanation)<br /><br />Prevalent throughout Graceling is a feminist undertone. Certain gender paradigms are subverted,for example marriage is not a requirement within the book. Women are portrayed as being just as strong as men. Men are allowed to cry. I love that Cashore stayed true to her theme/message and didn't give-in to societal expectations, especially in the ending of the book.<br /><br />As far as characters go, I really loved seeing the evolution of Katsa. We start off with a practically feral female -- with a conscience, then she sort of matures and there's some reveals. I loved Katsa's relationship with her cousin Raffin, who's heir to the throne, and a part-time medicine maker. I also OMG fell in love with Po, despite being thrown off by the teletubby name. Po's swoon worthy and quite well-developed. Also the interplay between Katsa and her Uncle Randa is awesome and parts are fairly reminiscent of Labyrinth when  Sarah tells Jareth off.<br /><br />The writing is fairly simple. Not too much time is spent worldbuilding, rather you are just thrown into Katsa's world and trusted to navigate without having everything explained to you. The tone reminded me of something I would read in a book of fairy tales. It was enchanting. I was completely mesmerized by this world, by the intrigue, the self-revelations, the messages, the characters.<br /><br />There were certain quotes within Graceling that spoke to me.<br /><br />\\"Who were they to take her fight away from her and turn it into some understanding between themselves? He should've taken more care of her face? She would knock his nose from his face. She would thump them both, and she would apologize to neither.\\" - pg. 90<br /><br />I love the above quote, because it reinforces how strong Katsa is. It shows she's not going to let some men treat her as an object, but rather as a person. I like that she wants to fight her own battles and if someone is going to fight over her looks, it should be her and not some male protector.<br /><br />\\"How absurd was it that in all seven kingdoms, the weakest and most vulnerable of people -girls, women- went unarmed and were taught nothing of fighting, while the strong were trained to the highest reaches of their skill.\\" - pg. 398<br /><br />To me this says if you are weak, there are things you can do to tip the scales in your favor. You can train, you can learn. If you think of yourself as defenseless and don't do anything to help yourself, you create a self-fulfilling prophecy. I totally think this can be applied to real life, how if you are weak in a certain area, not just physical, but idk, cooking, then you should learn and be taught how to do whatever you need to learn to do to make yourself a stronger/better person. Now, I don't see this quote as saying all women are weak, just women don't need a male protector, they can help themselves.

9889979942|5.0|If more than texture, color, and vibrancy can be captured in a photo, China: Portrait of a people written by Tom Carter has done just that.  Just by opening the book one is immediately transported to the many beautiful areas and people who live within the region.     One can completely imagine standing in the same spot as Carter was when he took these photos.  It's as though I have traveled there, although it is only a place that I have dreamed of going.     If I were lucky enough to go to China, this book would be tucked snugly within my suitcase, or in Tom Carter's case- backpack!  I think that is what sets this book apart from others is that the author literally backpacked across the region and to some extent, risked his life so that we may see China through his eyes.      Through his lens, we can share in the subtleties of living within lush farm land and the contrast of the chaotic organization of a city under neon lights.  The people- small children with the softest skin to the most weathered of all workers, Carter shows us more than just color and texture, he lends to us a deeper glimse to the many sides of China as well as human nature!
B003L5LEYW|5.0|First let me say that I'm hella mad at Amazon for now offering this LP for $5 when I got it for $8 off here a month or so earlier. But my thriftiness aside, Distant Relatives is a fantastic album. From start to finish every song provides a positive message about building up and taking value in one's life and existence. Additionally, the concept of the album especially the last track Africa Must Wake Up is a message of togetherness. We are all from Africa and though the diaspora of man over centuries has caused us all to look different, speak different etc, we are all brothers and sisters. More to the music, Nas and Damian do a great job of blending their individual styles of rap and reggae to produce a symbiotic flow where each artist seems to give life to furthering the lyrical prowess of the other. Everyone who I have played this album for thinks its fantastic. Do your self a favor and just pick it up. And if you are already a fan of Nas and/or Damian and you dont already have this album, SHAME on YOU! Get it now.

B003EYVXSC|2.0|Micmacs is a small, french film that must be viewed in the theater to produce the smallest amount of joy. In no way is this an interactive film as The Rocky Horror how is, but in witnessing the laughter of members of the audience, it may be possible to endure this film with a skeptical grin.<br /><br />Micmas is a jumbled mess that involves the orphaned Bazil who is in critical condition after being hit by a gunshot, but miraculously survives. Having lost job, and with no prior savings, he is forced to hit the streets and find his living through unconventional methods. To his good luck he meets the Slammer, himself an ex-con, who introduces him to a group of individuals, with varied talents, who have chosen to live in a dump. Varyingly artistic and athletic, these individuals choose to adopt Bazil by way of an obscure selection process. Bazil eventually becomes aware of identity of the individuals and organization(s) who were responsible for nearly ending his life. Unable to take action by himself, he enlists the talents of his new brothers and sisters in divulging the true identity of these despicable people.<br /><br />Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is well known for his exquisite characters studies, but going awry devotes little time on his characters in this picture. It actually seems like Jeunet has no interest in developing these characters as Bazil and his new-found characters lack personality; all that is known is that one of them is an artist, the other a contortionist and etc. Not only does this limited information make them seem superficial, but also unable the actors to give better performances. For their characters to become convincing and pleasant the actors have to deliver bombastic and overblown performances to conceal their weakly written characters.<br /><br />Jeunet has admitted that Micmacs was largely influenced by silent comedy with scenes that seem to be replicas of the old comedy masters-such as Buster Keaton. Were Chaplin, Keaton,  and Lloyd were whimsical, Jeunet is overindulgent and lacks the sense of control in guiding the comedic elements. Rather than serving as an administrator over the picture, he is too absorbed by the gags and special effects to comprehend where whimsy becomes just becomes wasteful and pathetic. Silent comedy functions greatly, to this day, because their humor is substitutes for their shortage of dialogue. Micmacs uses comedy to conceal its weakness in storytelling.<br /><br />With the Home Alone series families received a unique experience as the envisioned gags of the series, despite their excessive nature, were so basic in their conception that they still remained hilarious. Micmacs's gags are as excessive as the Home Alone series, but are also substantially sophistication. The success of the gags is impressive, but is undercut by the realization that there must have been a dozen easier methods of completing the mission of the film. The gags are so flawless that it seems that the raw materials for these gags are always too conveniently within the reach of our heroes. The gags are exquisitely done, but their technical value pales when it is realized that Jeunet's attempt is to carry the film on the weight of the gags alone.<br /><br />Micmacs is among those cute, little, French films that Jeunet, as the director of Amelie, has proved more than able to conceive time and time again. The difference is that unlike his other films, in this instance he lacks an approach. Many may find the film funny, but as a whole Micmacs is a hallow mess.is overindulgent and lacks the sense of control in guiding the comedic elements.

B003EYVXTG|4.0|Imagine if you relatives, close and distant, where to settle within the proximity to each other, did drugs to the point of excess, made and sold Methamphetamine, used firearms in treating any nagging conflict between each other, and still were relatively poor. Winter's Bone contains many characters that are conflicted by the above conditions, and as far as the film lacks any observable redeemable condition. They all are family, but in their midst it would be better to be a stranger, or best never to come in contact.<br /><br />Winter's Bone centers on Ree Dolly who in the absence of her father and the sickness of her mother, has to keep after her little sister and brother. Life is not easy as Ree's family lacks many of the basic necessities of life that her family and neighbors benefit from, such as food and hay for the horses. Her neighbor always pitches in to help her out with such basic needs, but isn't without her own intrusiveness about the affairs of the family. Despite the ardous conditions of life on the field, they live contently until an incident threatens to alter matters for the worst. It seems that their father who has been arrested multiple times for his illegal production and utilizing of Methamphetamine has put the house on bail and failed to appear for his hearing. If the family does not find him in time, they will lose their property. Ree sets out to find her father before they are thrown out of their house; a task she must be complete in less than a week.<br /><br />Finding her father should not be the issue as the people he associates himself are fellow family members, but these people are not willing to reveal anything as it may be used against them in a legal context. Their unwillingness infuriates Ree as these are not only the only sources she can trace toward her father, but also because many of these people are close relatives of her father, such as Teardrop who is his brother. The family members are so coldly removed from each other that Ree must remember them that they are family, and that this must count for some level of trust. The Dolly family are so emotionally distant that a distasteful or insulting act by one member could entice close relatives to physically harm him. Everyone of may have inherited the surname, but their safety lies in their actions. This families safety and freedom does not lie in the hand of the Police, considering the amount of illegal activities they commit, but in the hands of the more powerful members of the family. No one dares to cross paths with the \\"Chief\\" of the Dolly family, as his large army of minions has enough power to crush any member of the family that he wishes. The Dolly family is not unlike the Mafia where one person rules, the Don, and the inferior men are continuously trying to ascend in rank. Unlike the Mob , however, a  large majority of the Dolly family are forever condemned to remain inferior. The treatment of the woman is deplorable as it is implied that their only concerns should be within the kitchen and the bedroom.<br /><br />Jeniffer Lawrence's portrayal of Ree is central to the film's success as her presence makes the title character seem so empowered and determined to solve this mystery. She stares in the camera with such confidence that the idea that she has raised herself and her siblings seems convincing; her demeanor also suggests that her mother's sickness is nothing new but it has been an ongoing condition. Lawrence is especially brilliant in some  very masculine moments of the film, such as a scene involving skinning of squirrels and teaching her siblings in using a rifle. Much credit is also due to Director/screenwriter Debra Granik who shows Ree's inability to solve this case on her alone, and eventual surrender in the face of all the hardship that the Police and her family hurl in her direction. Granik has no intent to show Ree as a cowardly character, rather suggesting that without her family's help she is quite helpless and must concede defeat.<br /><br />This is a deftly created product where the insubstantial plot succeeds in seeming much more complex than it turns out to be. Winter's Bone owes its success to its approach which familiarizes the audience with few admirable characters who trying to accomplish this not so easy task among the numerous villainous family members who are willing to do anything to prevent Ree from finding her father. The film is so captivating in its unique mood and atmosphere that its virtually nonexistent plot is only recognized near the conclusion. As unbelievably odd and unlikely as the ending of the film may be, its bittersweet nature is as Dolly as Granik could have achieved.is a deftly created product where the insubstantial plot succeeds in seeming much more complex than it turns out to be.

B002ZCDR88|2.0|I rarely pan an album without considering its merits, but even with the amount of research Natalie Merchant has done to connect the poems and poets with the music she wrote to accompany them, these tunes lack something as basic as melody. All the accomplished musicians and complex orchestral arrangements do little to redeem this album. Tuneless and plodding, one wonders if Natalie's young daughter had to suffer all six years of such music in her formative years (since this album is based on the mother-daughter conversations, and readings they did together).     Sorry Natalie, I loved 'Tigerlily' and your output with 10,000 Maniacs, but this album just didn't work for me.
B003U21TAU|4.0|Watching DW via Amazon is far better than BBC America - no commercials to chop up the flow of the show, full intros and \\"next time\\" trailers, etc.  And, you can watch in HD, which is great because not every cable provider has BBC America HD, and DW is now shot entirely in HD. Anyway, \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" was a fun episode, in the tradition of the original DW series - which started as a kids' show about history, after all. The dynamic between Vincent and Amy is interesting - what happens when two gingers get together? - and what the Doctor does with Vincent and the TARDIS at the end, while expected, was still kind of tear-jerking and very well done.  This episode makes up for some of the duller moments of Series 5.

0312370849|4.0|An emotional, harrowing, poignant and well written book. This revolves around two periods of time. Set in July 1942 during the roundup of Jews in Paris to send them to their deaths in Auschwitz, known as the vel d hiv.Ten year old Sarah Starzynski's life is forever changes when the Vichy police come to her family's apartment to arrest her and her parents, She hides her four year old brother in a cupboard and promises him she will return for him. She is deported to an internment camp in route to Auschwitz but escapes with another little girl and takes refuge with an old couple in a farmhouse near Orleans.  The author succeeds in tying this to the story. The Nazis raid the house and take Sarah's critically ill friend Rachel to her death. Sarah remains hidden. she later returns to the flat with her adoptive grandparents and find a new family living in the apartment, as well as the corpse of her baby brother. De Rosnay<br />succeeds in conveying the horror and fear of the times and the love which Sarah receives from her adoptive family.<br /><br />The story is paralleled by that of Julia Jarmond, an American born  journalist living in Paris in 2002, married to an arrogant and selfish Frenchman. Jarmond begins work for her magazine on the vents surrounding the Vel d hiv, she stumbles upon Sarah's story and though pregnant her life begins to revolve around tying up the story when to her horror she discovers that the apartment her husband's family moved in to in 1942 that the the Jewish Starzynski family was brutally seized from.<br />Hence Sarah's story ties in with that of Julia and her family.<br />I would have preferred to read more of Sarah's life after the war, as a fascinating beautiful young woman living with her adoptive family, but this is mainly revealed through Julia's story.<br />De Rosnay is a talented writer who has crafted a thoroughly readable, penetrating, poignant and harrowing work, that I finished in two days. Succeeds in bringing to life the vel d hiv and the fate of the French Jews, and has informed many readers of the horrific events surrounding that ruthless action in which the French vichy police played an equal role to that of the German Nazis.e of the French Jews, and has informed many readers of the horrific events surrounding that ruthless action in which the French vichy police played an equal role to that of the German Nazis.

0307277887|4.0|I've watched the first three seasons of Dexter before having read this first book.     Mr. Lindsay has an easy wit that I enjoy. I love his send-ups of Miami, its drivers, the Cuban rendering of Spanish, the local food commentary, etc.     Although the show follows the book very closely, there are differences between the literary and TV personas of the characters. And I like both. I especially like both Det. Guertas equally - the literary Guerta for her astounding and entertaining stupidity but with the accompanying savant-like political genius and skill with killing verbal barbs, and the TV Guerta who is as intelligent as she is blindingly ambitious.     I look forward to reading the next book in the series, in which I assume Angel-no-relation will be developed further. The TV Angel is such a rich character.        A very entertaining read.    UPDATE AUGUST 21, 2010: I've now read the first four Dexter novels. Allow me to save you many hours of your life: Enjoy the coolness that is this first novel. Do not waste a moment of your time on the remaining three. Maybe #5 (yet to be published as of this date) will be the one that makes it all good again; I won't know, because I'm not giving Mr. Lindsay any more chances.

B00337KM2S|5.0|I looked up dark comedy in the dictionary and it had \\"Up in the Air\\" by it. There isn't much plot to the movie, yet it keeps moving. It makes a statement about following your dreams, family, and goals as Clooney's words somehow always come back to haunt him. I had to laugh at loud when Sam Elliot came back to talk to Clooney about joining the 10 million mile club. Shades of \\"The Big Lebowski.\\" I kept expecting him to call George \\"dude\\" and tell him he was his father. The movie is bittersweet at times and sad at others, although not a tear jerker. I was confused about his occupation. He is paid to come into an industry and tell the workers they are laid off. Doesn't HR fire people? Do they really hire an outside company to do that? The irony of a man who fires people for a living speaking at a conference called \\"Goalquest\\" is a bit Orwellian. The best line in the movie was during a firing that he allowed his young assistant to do. She got into trouble, so Clooney the master ax man, steps in and says, \\"Do you know why kids love ball players?\\" The old man says \\"Because the make a lot of money and have sex with beautiful women.\\" Clooney responds, \\"No, that is why we love them. The reason why kids love them is because they followed their dream.\\" He then convinces the man he can be a hero to grand kids by leaving this job and following his dream.

And I was \\"glad\\" to see that I had owned a complete, unabridged version of the book when I was small.  The School Library Journal lists it as being for Grade 7 and up; the Booklist says grades 3 - 6; I first read the unabridged version when I was 4 years old - and read it over and over until I was in seventh grade!  I must confess as I re-read the book, that I was picturing the drawings that were in the book I used to own.  Two drawings in particular stay in my mind - the one of Pollyanna being hit by the car and the one of the cat opening her bedroom door as her Aunt Polly cries out, \\"the child - will never walk again!\\"  This book, while it had illustrations, did not have any \\"graphic\\" illustrations.  What a shame.  The one thing I did not remember from the version I had as a child was Jimmy Bean's statement about halfway through the book:  \\"I ain't no beggar, an' biz'ness is biz'ness, even with Ladies' Aiders, I'm thinkin'.\\"  While I like the Disney version, too, the original is much better - and so much different from the Disney version!

1441702555|5.0|Roger Rees (Nicholas Nicholby, The West Wing, Cheers) heads a strong troop of actors who bring so much life to The Woman in White,  that this audio book is (in some ways)  superior to simply reading the book.  Listening to these characters tell their stories, one hears the hilarious shading, the omonious forboding, and insight and wit that you might otherwise miss.  I can't think of the last time I enjoyed a classic on audio so much.  Heard this way, The Woman in White is almost impossible to put down (or shut off.)  It's like a radio version of a Masterpiece Theatre series--but without the editing.<br /><br />The Woman in White, is an unusual Victorian novel as the story is told by a series of narrators, each of whom was present during a particular section of the story.  Often the reader knows more about what is happening, than the person narrating the story, and the perspective of a given character gives the reader an idea of what it would be like to be faced with such a wierd situation.  Roger Rees and his fellow actors bring their voices to life so realistically that you hear every nuance what is being said from the earnest narrative of the drawing master, Walter Hartright, to the creepy intonations of Count Fosco, to the intelligent and strong Marian Halcombe (surely one of the greatest female characters in English literature.) Funniest of all is the often overlooked Mr. Fairlie, a recluse and invalid who tells his story unwillingly as he really hates to be bothered doing anything at all.  Fairlie gives off a David Sedarious style of humour is so sly and witty that it would be easy to miss on the page--but is easy to absorb when listening.<br /><br />I do hope lots of people read this review and give this audio a try.  It is well worth it!

The costume design by Nina Proctor (who also did the costume design to \\"Spy Kids 3: Game Over\\", \\"The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl\\", \\"Grindhouse\\", \\"Push\\" (2009) & \\"Shorts\\") is excellent!    This is an excellent action thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you thinking at the same time. This is one of the best action movies in recent memory and also one of the best movies of the summer. This is just as excellent as the original \\"Predator\\" (1987), if not, better than the original. The visual effects and makeup are excellent.
0321647440|5.0|Excellent book to learn Aperture 3.  Being new to aperture it was a great tutorial to start with.   Wish the kindle version had away to down load the cd from a site.  Great Reference book
1401216676|5.0|This book is awesome, but it's definitely not worth paying for the overpriced hardback. They just released a reprint of it last month (June 2010) that you can pick up at any good comic shop for $5.<br /><br />writing: [9/10]<br />art: [9.5/10]
0307473708|2.0|I purchased this book thinking it would be a continuance of my beloved Dexter from the \\"Showtime\\" series. If you love blood and gore running rapid this may be for you.  I like the characters and how they were established on the TV series. I didn't like the way his sister Deb was portrayed in the book; she knew that Dexter is a killer, how does that fit in with the story line?  In this book Dexter doesn't kill his serial killer brother Brian; moreover, he watches as Brian kills LaGuerta, and in the end he lets his brother go.  I like Showtime's Dexter character that follows Harry's code and I'll leave the books for those who like a more sinister, evil character.

0439882826|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a Christmas present when it first came out, and when we moved it was put into a box with other collectible/display items and stuck into a closet for another day. Doing some Spring cleaning today with my now four-year-old Star Wars-loving son, we came upon it and couldn't resist sitting down for a read. It was so much fun to see his face and hear his exclamations on every single page. When we got to the last page, where you can glimpse Anakin's burned face behind the Darth Vader helmet, I thought we'd hit the pinnacle of enjoyment for my son... and then I popped open the smaller pages to either side of the helmet and Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker emerged holding light-up lightsabers. He slowly reached out a finger to touch one, as if he couldn't believe his eyes. It was a really great moment. I know we will be re-reading this special book for years. It is full of beautiful detail and hidden surprises, and if you treat it gently (as you should any pop-up book... most of the ones we own that are actually aimed at small children are torn apart) it will last for a long time.
B001DHXT6G|3.0|I have to say that I largely agree with R. Roberts.  The labeling - when having multiple programs on one disk, in a series of disks - should have been a lot more informative.  And, Paramount should have just improved the picture quality (with digital remastering, etc.) - not completely redone all of the special effects.  While the external views of objects in space(ships, etc.) may look sharper/better-defined and more realistic, unfortunately, their appearance is incongruent with the (lesser) quality of everything else - which was largely retained in original form - not to mention, some obvious object motion creations that were poorly done and that clearly defy the laws of physics.  For instance, there was at least one re-done scene where the Enterprise was now depicted externally as having almost flipped-over (bordering on the Titanic) from an attack, but the internal scene - kept in its original form - showed everyone standing on level ground (180 degrees).    What will Paramount do a few years from now, to \\"remaster\\" the series, again - or \\"improve it\\", in their point of view: redo the series and add more Iron Gym-like definition to McCoy's build?  Put Invisalign on Scotty?  Add hair to where Kirk's hair was thin?  Re-clothe the crew with uniforms from Star Trek: The Next Generation?  Replace Kirk's outmoded Judo-like fight sequences, with mixed-martial art moves? Voice-over all of the date references, so that the characters' typical references to the \\"past\\" - like to \\"World War III\\", instead go a few centuries beyond the 1990's (since we are now past those years, and WW III didn't happen)?
B003GDYN24|5.0|Kelis / Flesh Tone<br />Motherhood turned underrated hip-hopper Kelis into a bonafide dance diva, way beyond that milkshake of yesteryears. While still under-appreciated, the collaboration with everyone's favorite producer, David Guetta has yielded spectacular results. From the entrancing intro to the first single Acapella where she sings of the joy of having her baby to the club anthem 22nd Century, Kelis does it with enough panche and conviction. 9-song long and it's where the night begins. The dance floor.

B003LXM1RS|5.0|After the relatively dismal Ta-Dah, Jake Shears, Babydaddy and Ana Mantronic (what kinda name is that) are back with their best effort to date, the campy and saucy Night Work. The Bee Gees would be really proud of them. Listen to Something Like This, Skin Tight and Invisible Light and you will pretty much understand why you will feel like dancing.
030726999X|4.0|As you doubtless know, this is the third and final in the trilogy.  The NY Times book review and I agree that it's the best of the three.  Some people are happy to finish it because it is absorbing and prevents you from doing some of the other things that your really should be doing.<br />The courtroom scene is, for this lawyer, the best part of the book.  The book finally finishes giving us the details about our heroine's father and the blond giant.I'll avoid details so as not to spoil the story.
B003BKF696|5.0|While XX was heralded as the breakout emo rock band of 2009, The National ups the ante and releases their most visible effort to date. Veering towards deep melancholy and even sounding downright depressive at times, songs like Terrible Love, Bloodbuzz Ohio, Runaway and Sorrow will probably get you through that long, quiet night.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Firstly, Colin Firth is outstanding in this role.  I must warn homophobes - the preview makes it seem like he and Julianne are an item, well they are not. I'll leave it at that. Great plot, set design, cinematography - this movie was emotional, dark and really delivered on performances.  Nicolas Hoult was also amazing as the young college student.  Firth deserved the oscar nod.  This was Tom Ford (the designers) directoral debut and it does not disappoint.  It is the perfect fashion show with the perfect screenplay and the perfect performances.
B003KTMW9K|5.0|Were I a member of the gaming Industry right now, I would be shamed to be taught what gaming should look and feel like and how it should be marketed by a small Eastern European company. Who of the multi-billion gaming \\"giants\\" ever went back to improve a released game? Yet, there you have it: thanks to CD-PROJECT gaming as an art-form is still alive and kicking!<br /><br />This was the most awaited fantasy cRPG 3 years ago. Not only did the original deliver, but even more work has gone into truly improving it. This PLATINUM edition is patched (to the latest version, 1.5), DRM-free and uncensored. It also offers about 10-12 hours of extra gameplay, as it comes with a Bonus DVD containing new adventures, a printed Guide, printed Manual and a soundtrack CD - all in a beautiful cardboard box, reminding us of the golden age of gaming.<br />THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL cRPG GAMES I HAD EVER PLAYED - AND NOW IT IS GORGEOUS!<br /><br />The environments are detailed, realistic, and can be experienced from up close. Grass, flowers and tree branches moved in both [[ASIN:B000A76ZNO Fable]] and [[ASIN:B000WCCURW Titan Quest]] as well; these, however, seem so true I caught myself reaching for my...antihistamines! Weather affects and day-night alterations (you have to see the elongating shadows to believe them!) are just gorgeous! More importantly, these are not just eye-candy: certain NPCs and monsters appear only when the correct combination of time-of-day and weather coincide...The horizon is far and the clouds move in endless variations. It reminded me of the sky of the original UNREAL, another visually ground-breaking game at its time. PURE VISUAL MAGIC!<br /><br />The character (Geralt) can master both sword-fighting and magic spells (what is known as a Warlock). To some die-hard RPG fans this may seem like heresy, nevertheless, keep in mind that multi-classing is not unheard off. The movement repertoire for both practices are impressively designed. Especially the sword-fighting, it is at par to any console action game. And the spells (both offensive and defensive ones) are not less impressive.<br /><br />Free roaming? Yes and no. One can decide which parts of the map he will visit but loading is still needed to travel even annoyingly short distances. And since quests and side-quest still have to be completed, yes, eventually a subtle, yet ever present, directionality is present.<br />Looting and bartering? Aaah...yes, sort of. You practically never change the sword you start off with (although you do get to improve its abilities), whereas good armor is only a little easier to come by compared to [[ASIN:B00002EPZ2 Planescape: Torment]]. On the upside, you get to gamble, have romantic relationships (FABLE was full of great ideas after all!) and bribe for information, so trinkets have other uses as well.<br />Detailed character modifiers? Nothing like the AD&D rules. You gain talents (gold, silver & bronze) which you can spend to improve your fighting or magical abilities. Pretty much like the [[ASIN:B0002BQN7Q Diablo]] or the [[ASIN:B000WCCURW Titan Quest]] abilities systems.<br /><br />So, apart for the slight action-cRPG handicap, I have only two other objections. First, the...camera placement. Once more the notorious Aurora Engine (remember NWN2...?) will keep auto-placing it where it is bound to get on your nerves - as it targets your character even if that is not the most logical option. Yes, this has indeed improved compared to the original but one cannot teach an old dog new tricks.<br />Second, the controls. They need getting used to as the fighting combos are still easily ruined by clicking out of sync. You do eventually get the hold of it, however it keeps glitching.<br /><br />Nevertheless, its shortcomings are not enough to diminish the breath of fresh air this release brings to the scene. The Enhanced edition not only is a truly reworked game but it also comes full with detailed Manuals, beautiful Maps and all the extras that games used to come with in the good old days...<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B000FGA1US Baldur's Gate Saga]] was a masterpiece but (by today standards) is visually wanting to the casual gamer, whereas the [[ASIN:B000B8K7RC Neverwinter Nights]] [[ASIN:B00118SU98 Series]] was found, well, wanting in most aspects. THE WITCHER is DREAM cRPG that BIOWARE was supposed to be capable of releasing all along but never did - until very recently [[ASIN:B001IK1BWC Dragon Age: Origins]].<br />That dream game, however, is finally here - and not from whom you would expect. A tip of my hat to CD-PROJECT for keeping the ART-FORM of PC Gaming alive. Well done indeed!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!![[ASIN:B000FGA1US Baldur's Gate Saga]] was a masterpiece but (by today standards) is visually wanting to the casual gamer, whereas the [[ASIN:B000B8K7RC Neverwinter Nights]] [[ASIN:B00118SU98 Series]] was found, well, wanting in most aspects.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|Like some other reviewers here, I still own and treasure my vinyl copies of the classic, timeless early DEVO albums. And as much as I love \\"Q: Are We Not Men?\\", \\"Duty Now for the Future\\", and of course, \\"Freedom of Choice,\\" one of my favorites remains \\"Oh No! It's Devo!\\"  Since then, I've enjoyed each succeeding release a little less than the one before it.     Happily, \\"Something For Everybody\\" reverses that trend in a big way! The boys are back. Infectious hooks, clever lyrics, fun and unexpected melodies...it's all here.     If you're an old-time Devo fan like me, buy this CD. You will not be disappointed  If you're new to Devo and you love this, do yourself a favor and explore their earlier releases--especially the ones mentioned above. There's a whole world of strange, wonderful delights waiting.    (By the way--I just had the opportunity to see them play live at the Minnesota Zoo. The sold-out crowd was on its feet the entire time. Amazing energy. If the opportunity to see them live presents itself...don't miss it.)
B000K7UBTI|2.0|This movie is a real tragedy.  The story and character development is above-par, but the absolutely horrible computer graphics bring down the entire film.  It starts with Stark Industries, despite having been warned against doing so, using breakthrough technology to raise an ancient (and cursed) city in China.  This fulfills an ancient curse and releases elemental demons.  Tony Stark is captured by Chinese rebels and forced to design a weapon capable of leveling the city once again.  Following Stark's origin, he builds Iron Man armor to escape.  In order to defeat these mystical monsters he is responsible for releasing, Tony Stark must become the Invincible Iron Man and find a way to save the world.<br /><br />As it stands, Invincible Iron Man has strengths but some serious weaknesses. Tony Stark is well handled pretty well here, though still cannot touch the amazing work done by Robert Downey Jr.  The female lead is quite good and her story arc is touching; introducing an Asian cultural theme of family duty that most Americans, especially Tony Stark, cannot comprehend.  The overall plot is serviceable, but the villains rather underwhelming, especially because of the terrible inconsistency between animation and cgi.  Most of the film is traditionally animated, but the villains, (and Iron Man himself during some of the fights), are done with very cheesy cel animation.  Maybe it would've been impressive in, idk, the 90's?  Saying it looks like a cut-scene from an original X-Box game would be insulting the X-box.<br />This honestly could have been one of the better films, but the animation is just so horrible that it hijacks the entire film.  There's some great character work with Tony Stark and the overall storyline is serviceable.  If you're a hardcore fan and don't mind your fight scenes looking like something out of The Sim's, then you'll probably enjoy Invincible Iron Man. But if you're a normal human being, there's no way you'll watch this over the 2008 Iron Manstarring Robert Downey Jr.
0307454541|5.0|I don't generally read thriller/mysteries and I waitied for a long time before trying this one, but once started, I couldn't put it down. I've read the second in the series and don't dare start the third until I have time to read it non-stop.
0307594777|5.0|It's hard to review these three great books that were actually published after the author's death. One can't say I can't wait until his next, only suggest that you will value them as part of your library. Starting with \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" the story's flow with the same main characters throughout the next two books, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\" The \\"girl\\" is Lisbeth Salander, a unique young woman of fantastic computer skills and physical ability that had become the object of a government cover up and abuse. She's befriended by Mikael Bloomkvist, a moralistic publisher of the magazine Millennium, in an interwoven net of intrigues that keep you turning pages in wonder of what's coming next.<br /><br />The books are translated from Swedish but the names and places remain as written, giving you the reader, a more than casual glimpse of Sweden, its socialist leaning social safety net economy and form of government. The dialogue while translated, retains its Swedish cadence and flow.  It's a kick to have major characters not always traveling by automobiles, which are very expensive to own and operate in Sweden, but instead use Stockholm's Tunnelbana, one of the most beautiful metro systems in Europe. All three books have Bloomkvist and the staff at Millennium on the side of social justice - one can imagine much like Stieg Larsson's real life job as editor in chief of the magazine Expo in fighting antidemocratic right-wing extremist and Nazi organizations.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Bundle is a treasure you'll enjoy owning.

B003NHRIVQ|3.0|I will admit straight out I am a MC fan. Even that can save a lukewarm movie. Some of the characters in the book, like the Pastor, Scott, Blaze, and Marcus are underutilized in the movie. They also don't show the touching end for Steve at all very much.
B001TH8UUA|1.0|Bought this cable back in mid March. It stopped working today (7/10/10). I will stick with HDMI cables from MonoPrice from now on.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I can tell they put alot of care in making this. Its a good thing I didn't see this in theatres because everytime Michael Jackson starts singing I will be singing and dancing in my seat. This movie basically consist of Michael Jackson and his crew preparing for his new kick*** tour This Is It. Its very interesting seeing how michael works. You can tell hes a true musical genious. He knows exactly how he wants to go about things and how he wants his music played. To add icing to the cake this movie consist of just about every fan favorite including his newest song This Is It (I have the album too). I absolutely loved the new videos they made for Earth song and Thriller. I also love seeing the visuals the planned to have throughout the show. I do wish You Rock My World, Will You Be There, and Don't stop till you get enough were part of the concert. My favorite Mike song is Human Nature.     One thing about Mike that makes him such a great entertainer is that he does 100% more than any artist I've ever seen in my 18 years. He doesn't just sing and dance on stage in front of a microphone, but he always puts on a puts on a show. You don't know what to expect while in other concerts like Beatles or rap concerts its just peaple singing on stage rarely moving around (Sorry Beatles fans I'm just not into them like that). You couldn't really blame Michael for not moving the way he used to he isn't as young as he was after all.      I heard that before his death peaple had lined up and bought tickets ahead of time. I don't blame them because this would have probably been the greatest concert in history sinse I think his Dangerous tour which happened before I was born. Its sad that this will never be. I would have loved to make this my first concert in general, but saddly I will never get to see the King of Pop on stage. RIP Mike.
0061537934|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read.  If you are a dog lover, you will never see your pet the same way again.  Loving told from the perspective of Enzo, the dog, it has all of your emotions running at high speed.  I have given this book to anyone that I know who has a great afinity to their current pet or one that they have lost to ease the pain of such a loss of part of ones family. Highly recommend it!
0452284392|3.0|A little dry to begin with... but he brings up some interesting points on our linked and possibly soon to be \\"Orwellian\\" world of interconnected and publicly available information.<br /><br />Very heavy on the history of linked \\"networks\\" but very light on \\"what it means\\".
B002UXRGM0|5.0|The quality of this production is just, simply stated, \\"The Best\\".  Very glad we chose the Attenborough narration.    If you're looking for picture detail to \\"wow\\" you in 1080P, here it is.     We love it!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This DVD set was great, it is my favorite show right now. The show itself was even better in the second year than the first. The chemistry between all of the characters has grown. I think Walowitz especially excelled during season 2.  One big plus is that you get the bonus of watching the show without commercials.  Finally, since the shows are only about 20 minutes long, you can watch two episodes in a row usually.     One of my favorites from season 2 featured a train trip with a special guest appearance by an actress who has been in Sci Fi movies and TV that all of the guys (except Sheldon) hit on, it is hilarious.  Overall, this is definitely a 5 star rating.
B000001FI7|5.0|Hopefully I'll never be so jaded that I won't be able to recognize a masterpiece. Even when it comes from a genre that I don't particularly care about. Even when it has so obviously been produced to \\"wow\\". Even when it has much more than a whiff about it of slickness and of product. But nobody could ever calculate all of the elements that come together to make this such an evocative and moving work. I am probably alone in having Numb as my favorite track. But the vividness of all of the sounds! I could eat them. That Hammond - that drum sound. It goes right into my belly and my heart.<br /><br />Beth Gibbons has something about her sound that reminds me of my beloved Alison Statton of Young Marble Giants. It's a strange comparison. Beth is obviously much more of a \\"singer\\" than Alison ever was. But maybe it has something to do with the way they both place themselves INSIDE the music rather than the usual singer thing of on top of it. Maybe there's a psychological similarity rather than a sonic one.<br /><br />When this CD came out, it was played in every hip caf&eacute; and restaurant. I tried to resist it - especially the hit, Sour Times. But it was impossible to resist. That plaintive cry \\"Nobody LOVES me!...\\"<br />Such an ambiguous, poignant moment. And all those filmic downward bass lines and strings (especially on Glory Box) - delicious!<br /><br />15 years on, it still sounds great. Is it too commercial, too slick? It is definitely both commercial and slick. But it is also musically brilliant, compelling and magical.
B001AP11L6|1.0|This dog and pony show breathes new life into P.T. Barnum's observation that \\"there's a sucker born every minute.\\"  Would it be too much to ask that they transfer a little coin from their obviously lavish wardrobe budget into music lessons?  A metronome, perhaps.    Grade school kids play better than this, but I suppose that's one more reason to love them in the minds of their faithful.
B0013HA838|5.0|In my personal opinion this is now the top \\"Le Nozze\\", the one which all others are to be measured against. I own the two Glyndebourne (73 and 94) productions featuring outstanding \\"name casts\\". This one with new young singers,though I'm sure they are well known in Opera circles, is just as outstanding. Those of you who have had a problem with David Mcvicar's productions (he is known for non-traditional stagings) will find this staging very acceptable (i.e. traditional though set in maybe 19th century?) and enjoyable. Presented in much better sound and video quality than the 73 or 94 versions. The 94 version while in good stereo and 5.1 it is a \\"full screen 4:3\\" video version. This version is in 16:9 wide screen w/ stereo and DTS 5.1. The 73 version is \\"historically \\" outstanding but allowances need to be made for the video and sound, while not bad,not quite of same guality of the 94 or this 06 version. You can not miss with any of these but if you need just one then this 2006 Mcvicar production is the one to purchase. It also comes with a mini-doc with director, conductor, and members of the cast where as the other two are just the opera.  Dan Rincon

9889979942|5.0|I went to China in 1995 for work and went cabin crazy.  My company provided a bus to get us from our hotel to the office and brought McDonalds to the meeting room for lunch.  It was all I could do to get my fellow travellers out in the evenings.  My wanderings since have taken me all over the world, but I've always wanted to go back to China to see what I missed.  Now Tom Carter brings it all to my living room with gorgeous photos of the people in endless variety.  It satiates and whets the appetite at the same time.

B0001GMIOE|1.0|THIS IS NOT A SLAM AGAINST CANON OR ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS.  The OEM Canon batteries are excellent.  I was a victim of a \\"bait-and-switch\\" (as were others) by Amazon and Eforcity.  I \\"assumed\\" I was getting the BP511A Canon OEM battery when I ordered off what I thought was an Amazon webpage.  What happened is that I got shuffled over to Eforcity's webpage.  On there was a picture of a Canon BP511A OEM battery in a bubble pack with Canon written all over it.  The specs matched my current Canon batteries so I ordered two.  I should have been leery of the price, but I ordered anyway.  A few days later I get a package from Eforcity.  Out pops two Chinese brand x knock-offs!  They had a label saying BP511 and the specs were different.  There was no way I was going to use these in my Canon cameras.  I contacted Amazon immediately.  They in turn contacted Eforcity who sent me an email asking if I wanted replacements or a refund.  I wrote them a nasty email back claiming bait-and-switch and so on, but never heard back from them.  I then contacted Amazon who promptly refunded my money.  I was asked to write a review on my experience with Eforcity.  When I read other reviews about them, it looked like there was a lot of bait-and-switch going on with that company.  BUYER BEWARE!
0439023483|5.0|This book was amazing. I read it all night and even cried! What an amazing writer. It was very violent for a young audiance so I would recomend 14 and up and even then you might want to preview it yourself before your teen reads it. There was a nice romance between the charaters but it never went farther than a kiss whitch was great! I loved this book and will be reading the 2 as soon as I can get my hands on it.
B001IYCMNA|4.0|I have 3 of these WAP4410n AP's running in office environments, all over PoE connected to enterprise level Cisco gigabit switches. These are great units on the v1 firmware. Recently bought a new one that came with the latest firmware. Using PoE connected to a Cisco 3560 gigabit switch, the AP would turn off after about 15 minutes of operation on PoE and wouldn't come back on. Hooking it up to regular power would get it going again, and then you could disconnect the wall plug and let it run on PoE for about another 15 minutes before it turned itself off again. Nothing in the event logs of the AP or the switch. I downgraded the firmware to the older v1 version, and it's been solid as a rock ever since.    I'll buy some more of these and keep trying the new firmware, but if I run into any problems it will be back to v1 for solid operation.
B001JDS7CU|5.0|Boy, are we enjoying these programs!  Camera work is absolutely fantastic with slow pans, super high-def clarity, zooms and close-ups. You wonder how in the world did they shoot these scenes. Narration is superb, unhurried and even entertaining.  No doubt this is something to treasure and keep for ages.  If you have the money, do not be hesitant on this purchase.  It is both fun and educational, and that is hard to find these days.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I loved this show when it originally played those many years ago.  Daria, Jane and all the others are back, cutting through or laying down the BS that is high school, and middle class suburban living.  This show should still be on.  Or at least Daria and Jane should have been followed through college.  This dvd incarnation is good.  But the music is missing.  All that's played is either Splendora's theme or Mystick Spiral's music.  NTTAWWT, but in over 10 years couldn't MTV/Viacom have been at work getting clearances?  This and a lack of extras earn 4/5 stars.  The show is good enough for that.  If you must have this then go for it.  But remember, there is no music aside from theme and MS.
B003HARV98|4.0|It's been said that rock music has matured enough over the last five decades or so that we're past the point where a real new sensation is going to come along, the type of sensation who invents a completely new genre, the type of artists who unleash seismic tremors rippling through the entire rock n roll landscape and rearrange it forever.      One such female artist is Kate Bush, who burst upon the scene in 1977 or so, and continues to influence countless female (and, arguably, some male) artists decades later.    While she doesn't invent a new genre, Marina Diamandis does reinvent the genre Ms. Bush spawned.  She carves out her own style, blending into it several of the very singers who have been influenced by Kate Bush.    Diamandis' likes to hover in the upper registers with her voice much of the time.  She has a very confident, assertive, and arresting singing style that draws the listener in.    She's already big in the UK, but I suspect we'll be hearing a lot more about this great artist in the US soon as well.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|TV these days is full of mindless junk...Breaking Bad is one of those rare gems that you stumble upon by accident that leaves you feeling hopeful about television entertainment again.  Breaking Bad is a great concept: a terminally ill man's desire to leave his family with something after he's gone.  Bryan Cranston's character is by far one of the best ever created- an underachieving chemist who lives a bland life in middle class America- and played by a true artist of the acting craft.<br /><br />The first season left my husband and I speechless many times, while simultaneously shaking our heads in disbelief at what was playing out in front of us.  The plot in each episode has many twists and turns, almost always never what you anticipate.  We frequently raved to friends and family about this show, surprised that no one else seemed to either \\"get it\\" or know about it when it first debuted.  This underground hit has just finished its third season, which strongly ties to its first that lays the foundation to everything that has badly broken for Walt, Jesse, and their lives.
0312360266|3.0|Despite some of the negative reviews on this book I decided to give it a try. I do have to agree with some of the reviews, some of the subject matter seems to be a little mature for the young adult category; dropping the f-bomb, talk about oral sex and touching oneself, etc. Yet some of the terminology was very immature - poopie and boobies?? I don't have a kid that fits this reading category yet, but if I did I am not too sure that I would be thrilled to have her read this kind of stuff.    Some of the reviews refer to the main character, Zoey, as a slut but maybe that comes along later in the series because there was no real slutty behavior (on her part anyway) in this book.    The story itself is interesting enough and I am curious to see how some of it plays out, but a lot of the dialogue between the younger characters seems like things that the author thinks kids say or how she thinks they talk, it is a little over the top and cliche at times.     Rereading what I wrote it seems like I didn't like the book at all, which isn't the case. I can overlook the complaints I have listed, but I am an adult. I just think parents should be adequately warned as to what their kid may be reading.    I did get the second book, which seems to have some better reviews so we'll see how that goes.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Great read...takes a little to get into it, but picks up from the middle to the end.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Maybe even four and a half. This review is for the entire trilogy, not just the first book, and you certainly should not stop after the first one because the later parts of the story are much more interesting.  When I started reading this book, I was not impressed. The setting is cartoonish, larger than life--standard fantasy fodder, with a bizarrely overeducated renaissance-era european-style metropolis as the main backdrop (capital of a prosperous constitutional monarchy, of course), an exotic desert empire in the south, frozen mountains filled with barbarian warriors in the north, and a pervasive magical influence that is nonetheless ignored by most of the population. Similarly, the characters all seemed to be cookie-cutter, perhaps pulled from a video game. I won't comment on them individually, since there are so many, but each of their stories carried a sense of deja-vu. I've wondered more than once if Abercrombie didn't conceive this book as a writing exercise: Can I start from the most generic set of standard fantasy tropes around, and in a few hundred pages turn it into great fiction? Yes, he can.  Throughout the series the setting remains somewhat overdone, but its importance declines in favor of plot and character. Abercrombie's writing has a subtle way of not taking his world too seriously that turns it from tired and overused backdrop into an almost Pratchett-esque self-parody (the Other Side stuff is strongly reminiscent of the Things from the Dungeon Dimensions, and in fact all the magic has a slightly comedic feel). It functions as a catalyst for the story without being intrusive or distracting.  The major characters though, almost to a person, subvert their typecasting and turn out entirely different than expected. Each one has depth, power, and most of all realism. This series is not afraid to address and even embrace the darker side of the human psyche, and it does so with humor, pathos, and a total refusal to conform to expectations about personalgrowth and redemption.  The plot, too, takes a turn away from its initial course of epic save-the-world-from-evil stuff and dives into intrigue, war, and politics at a very personal level. Hardly groundbreaking, but the pacing is excellent and the writing is compelling and never predictable. The ending was especially refreshing--Abercrombie not only refuses to write feel-good endings where they don't belong, he also won't neatly tie off all the loose plot threads just so he can put \\"The End\\" in big bold letters on the last page. No real story ends that cleanly, and there is nothing clean about Abercrombie's style.  Th First Law trilogy does not have the enduring power and drama of the greatest fantasy literature, nor could it stand up on its own without other writers to lay the foundations. But it has a unique and visceral appeal: Abercrombie takes the standard fantasy genre and kicks it down a notch, grounding it messily in the reality of human nature. I applaud him for it.
0307269752|5.0|A maze that Larsson leads the readers through and makes them wonder where it is going. Loved it. Probably the best of the three books, but if you want to put some flesh on the charters read the second book. If you read the second book you will more than likely read the third. Because the first book is so good I have friends say they where told not to read the second. That is like telling someone who has read the Hobbit not to read The Lord Of the Rings, because the story line moves slower. It does. But would anyone change it? I am not comparing Larsson and Tolkien only the first books in their series to the ones that followed.
0439023483|3.0|Despite the fact that the basic premise is nonsensical, and some major logical inconsistencies notwithstanding, this book is kind of a fun read. It takes a while to get going (all the exposition was pretty superfluous, since I didn't end up caring much about the characters anyway) but the telling of the preparations and the actual games is exciting and in some ways even original. I kind of hoped the ending would involve more death, but maybe that's just me being morbid.  My suspension of disbelief broke down repeatedly through this story--I'll give a couple of examples. First, though less important, the premise of an empire that makes its tribute nations pay for expensive welfare services by sending ritual sacrifices to a gladiator fight seems improbable, from both a social and economic standpoint. Then there's the protagonist's outstanding archery skills (somewhat unbelievable in itself, but we'll let that go) which, when actually needed, tend to fail her spectacularly. I guess the book would have been too short otherwise. But the big one is her total lack of empathy or emotional intelligence. In fact, her obtuseness is drawn out so long, even with other characters trying to fill her in, that it goes beyond contrived. Ignore that, though, and the disparity between the high level of technology apparently available and the extremely low level in use (no, poverty does not explain it) and you can just sit back and enjoy the action sequences and some of the imagery.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I rarely write reviews but this CD sparked me to start.  No joke..no hype...no kidding...if you pass on this CD you will be passing on the best piece of work Eminem has ever done.   The compulations of the music and lyrics are like nothing ever before.   I cant put it down, I cant let it sit, I cant help but keep listing to this bit!  If you ever thought he was done, ever thought he was out, ever even had a MF doubt then buy this CD and you will learn, you will play, you will respect and have no regret! Im not kidding, I wont steer you wrong, spin that record and get your Shaddy on!
0971407614|4.0|Sometimes he is hard to follow.  It seems that the guys first language is not english and that he did not get an editor.  That being said, following his workout routines I have noticed that I am building muscle and am very pleased with the results.
0618918248|5.0|As a person who came from a crazy background as a child-paternal side no religion (but not atheist) and maternal side-southern Baptist, I can tell you that I couldn't agree more with Dawkins.  I tried on various religions as a youth but found them limiting and not logical. I choose to study Zoology in college and minor in religion to try and get a more informed world view of religion.  What I have found is that my \\"goodness\\" comes from being a caring individual who had traveled, listened, participated and watched as our country has shifted to the right and seems to have lost its \\"mind\\".  From rewriting history in Texas, to trying to force science teachers to \\"teach\\" creationism in Kansas I can't understand how these things are helpful (they are not, they are just part of a selfish agenda of the conservative Christian).  And yet I know many Christians that are good intelligent people who DO NOT hate and spew negativity. As a high school biology teacher that isn't what we need to create balanced individuals.  In fact I think our whole educational system has lost sight of what we are supposed to be doing-educating the youth to prepare them to be \\"good citizens\\".  This means that they can think, reason, draw conclusions, seek information, be active in their communities, be tolerate, know and practice healthy lifestyles, and lastly be \\"good\\".  I also agree that indoctrinating children into religion is abusive but so is stuffing fast food down their throats and plying them with soda 24 hours a day (see above statement about how adults should have knowledge to raise their offspring and this includes knowledge of health and eating-all of these things should be taught in Biology class instead of wasting time memorizing facts and passing the regents exam (I live in New York State enough said).  I don't want to force anyone to change their beliefs but I want to encourage all people to expand their knowledge base and at least be more tolerant of other's views and dialogue instead of hate.ad of hate.
B00005OWIU|5.0|You will not be let down from this CD. It's exactly what I had been looking for!
0307454541|4.0|I enjoyed this book and I recommend it. It does contain graphic violence and sexual encounters, so it is not for the immature reader. It is set in Sweden, therefore you do get a lot of Swedish names and places which I have to admit made me snicker every once in a while when a long string of names and places came rolling across the page in one sentence. Nothing like getting directions on how you get from A to B in Sweden. As I am not versed in the original language version, I have no idea how accurately it has been translated but I do not expect it is wildly off-base. It takes time to get rolling and the author was not the master of \\"Just One More Chapter Before I Stop For The Night\\", but I never felt the desire to give up on it. I think you will find it worth the time and you will want to continue through the rest of the series.<br /><br />The question you have to ask is if it is worth spending the money to buy a copy. I invested in hardcover copies which I found here at Amazon for what I felt was a fair price. I intend to keep my copies since I enjoyed the series, I will probably go back and read them again in the future.<br /><br />I have also just purchased the film made in Sweden and have watched it. I will post a review for it, but I will say here that the Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth Salander is so spot on in her portrayal, it is like she walked right out of the book.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000ION79Y|1.0|This is so bad it shouldn't even be considered a movie. 1st 10 minutes of the production doesn't even make sense with Helicopters closing in on a military facility and Seagal driving a Hummer the \\"bad guys\\" open up with mini guns and kill everyone while the \\"men in black\\" (lower case) couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. \\"Good guys\\" couldn't just call \\"men in black\\" and warn them about pending doom?<br />\\"Bad guys\\" pick up secret item, place it in hard plastic case and throw off the (black)covers on 2 motorcycles they just happen to sneak in out in the open. 1 guy gets killed by chopper (amazed you will be that it wasn't the guy carrying secret item) and \\"Blade-That-Comes-Out-Of-Sleeve\\" dude is off. Seagal gives chase because somehow he knows that this guy has the item, not the other guy that was killed. Machine gun from helicopter cannot target BTCOOS dude, but rocket brings him down. Amazingly it's right in front of second get--away vehicle! Cool, right? Seagal jumps out of Hummer and confronts BTCOOS dude in the woods even though we've just seen Seagals' Hummer driving past corrigated metal warehouse and *Wammo tASSY Bing Bhoff Hoe* the blade is in BTCOOS dudes forehead! SecretItem recovered.<br />What was that?............the rest of the movie? Ahh, no....i was only able to stand up until that part.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I only caught onto \\"In Treatment\\" during it's second season and I literally couldn't watch it enough. I watched episodes over and over. The stories are so connected and so real. I then went back and purchased the first season and learned so quickly how much the second season built off the first season. Just brilliant. October can't come soon enough for me to get my hands on the second season so I can experience them again. Now just bring on the third season.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|First of all, this writing is topnotch, par excellence, superb, and all other superlatives that can be added. But incidentally probably not for all of us.    At the top of the day I'm PETER KEATING, doing and saying everything as everybody expects me to do and say. As soon as I realize that people don't really know what they want I become ELLSWORTH TOOHEY, leading and telling everybody what they are to do. It is so funny how people can be lead to cliffs and other forms of destruction as soon as you show them \\"we are all in this together.\\" Being ET vanishes at midmorning when the unreality of the intellect behind wears out (non-existent from the start), leaving me to trust only myself to be GAIL WYNAND. Alone in the realization that if you want something done right, do it yourself. At the end of the day all that matters is my work and doing it right as HOWARD ROARK. Then I seem to forget or maybe therpeutic amnesia and go through the vicious cycle again. The only thing is that my DOMINIQUE FRANCON is still married to her GAIL WYNAND.     This is a very thought-provoking work and made me wonder whether people are really motivated at levels as deep as the characters here. The Love between Howard and Dominique is the most intense I've ever read. I cannot get enough of this book so I'm compelled to re-read and of course I'm inviting everyone to experience this.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Great collection of Madonna's videos. Can't beat it for the price. What's up with all these negative comments on video quality?? Did I get one of only a few with good video? No idea what the complaints are about. Strange.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|So I finally got around to watching \\"Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief\\" (thanks On Demand! lol) & I'd have to say I was disappointed.  Yes, I know that when good books are interpreted for the cinema that the book will ALWAYS be better (mostly due to movies still cannot compete with human imagination), but I was hoping for something better than what I just sat through.<br /><br />***SPOILERS! Do NOT read any further IF you don't want info about the movie!!!***<br /><br />Here's a list of Pros & Cons about \\"Percy Jackson\\":<br /><br />CON: Percy Jackson - in the book, he's a 12 year old with ADHD and dyslexia...which causes him to have issues in school (so much so that he changes schools frequently).  In the movie, Percy is now 16-17 years old with a weird Adam Lambert haircut & a \\"wink wink nudge nudge\\" delivery of his lines.  I think this was an agenda to try & snag more teen/tween girls into attending.  I had a hard time thinking he was a credible Demigod when he looks like the mutated love child of Zac Efron & Justin Bieber.<br /><br />PRO: Grover - I just have to acknowledge the fact that Brandon T. Jackson (who often stole the show in \\"Tropic Thunder\\") made a great Grover.  He played him with humor & distracted us from Zac Bieber's inability to act.<br /><br />CON: Clarice - is missing. Completely.  To have Percy's major antagonist completely MISSING from the movie was just plain stupidity.<br /><br />CON: Annabeth - is different. Completely.  The \\"writers\\" of this movie decided to blend the characters of Clarice and Annabeth...resulting in the \\"Claribeth\\" mess in the movie.  She's the daughter of Athena but kicks booty like a daughter of Ares.  Disappointing doesn't even begin to cover it.<br /><br />CON: Hades - played by the often hilarious Steve Coogan.  Hades could've gone both ways - either wickedly evil OR (by using Coogan's talents) weirdly funny.  Instead, Hades came off as anemic & a tad boring.<br /><br />PRO: Medusa - brought to life with an over-the-top performance by Uma Thurman in an acting style a tad reminiscent of her \\"Poison Ivy\\" role.  I think this movie could've been good if it was all handled a bit more tongue-in-cheek.<br /><br />I could go on but all I have are more \\"cons\\".  The only other \\"pro\\" would've been the character of Luke, who was believable as a snarky teen with daddy issues.  I'm thinking this series will flame out (cinematically - see \\"The Golden Compass\\" for another example of this) before it even really started due to shoddy writing, bad casting, and an inability to adhere to the original plot. Chris Columbus should be ashamed for his true disservice to a great series.style a tad reminiscent of her \\"Poison Ivy\\" role.

B002BIULQ2|5.0|This movie is for ALL ages, for the young to also the elderly. For some people, when watching this movie, it might even cause some stirred up raw emotions, breaking one into tears, because this movie can cause some painful realizations to those with some kind of painful struggles in life. This movie does come with happy endings, and Miley is fortunately given a second chance to make up for having done against others in her life. For some people, seeing this movie may have some people wishing they can go back to a certain place in their past, be it physical place or emotional place.<br />But I cannot highly recommend this movie enough, not only recommend, but cannot suggest enough that people pass this movie on as well. But don't just take my word for it; see for yourself!<br />Make sure you have PLENTY of Puffs tissues ( or your preferred kind) as well, regardless of your gender, just in case!
0385341008|5.0|Reason for Reading: I've wanted to read this since the minute it came out! The title is the first thing that grabbed my interest then of course all the positive reviews. Somehow the book just kept getting pushed further down my tbr pile until finally it rose to the top when it was randomly selected as my final book for the Random Reading Challenge.<br /><br />I'll keep this review short since there are hundreds, make that thousands of reviews already online. I feel like I may be the last book blogger to read this book! As anyone who reads my reviews regularly might have guessed: how could I not have absolutely loved it! Everything I enjoy in this type of book is present here, historical fiction written as a collection of letters with a cast of eccentric characters. Perfection! I just love epistolary novels and they read so fast it is almost impossible to put the book down. Each and every single character was a dear and getting to know them through someone's letters somehow seems so personal and insightful. I loved everyone though I must say Dawsey and Isola were my favourites.<br /><br />As to the historical content, while the book takes place one year after the war it often feels to be in the here and now as the letters are full of reminiscences of wartime experiences. I must say that even with all my reading of World War II, I had not known that the Channel Islands had been occupied. It didn't surprise me, tactically I can understand how the situation happened, but I'm surprised it has never been mentioned in my previous reading. It was an eye-opener for me and I'm now quite interested in finding out more about the occupation and the experiences of people from different points of view.<br /><br />A delightful little book, that is a quick read with dramatic, tragic, romantic and comedic moments to be found throughout. A truly beautiful book not to be missed!
B002ZG997C|5.0|We saw the movie in the theater and couldn't wait to get it on DVD!! Denzel is fabulous, as always. Gary Oldman was perfect as the evil guy. Definitely worth purchasing!
B0037QGS0A|5.0|...To the harsh critics before me, ouch. I, for one, disagree to the umpteenth degree with you all.<br />To me, Chloe was a work of art. A pure genius look at human behavior: how we create our own fantasies, lust for something more, and are capable of changing the world we've come to know in an instant.<br />  Yes, at times this film is graphic. But this sexual and erotic exploration only heightens the intensity and power of its message.<br />  What I love the most is that my take on it is different than your take on it that's different from your next-door neighbor's take on it. There are so many ways to interpret the well-thought out meaning of Chloe-- so many that the director even mentions to Amanda that he's curious to see how she will react to it when she's older. (The commentary, by the way, is lovely and entirely insightful. Definitely worth listening to... At least parts of.)<br />  I love movies that make you think, and by far this one did just that. The cover says it all, subtly yes, but intriguingly as well. What happens when a love triangle falls apart... when a lover disappears?<br />  Chloe isn't meant to be a high-packed, heart-wrenching thriller/drama. It is simply meant to observe and report, in a sense. To delight, arouse, and question.<br />  Brilliantly written, beautifully directed, and phenomenally acted by Neeson, Seyfried (best role she has played to date, in my opinion), and Moore. Bravo.
B00006RU5B|2.0|2 1/2      Only a few tracks can rise above a tyrannical sludge pulsating in predictable time- elevating this particular supergroup only slightly above the stale stylings of a Velvet Revolver.
B00001OH7X|3.0|`Lodger' is considered the third `Berlin' record but it was not recorded there but in Monteux but it was the last of three albums that Bowie made in collaboration with Brian Eno so maybe that is why it is considered part of some trilogy. It is also an LP that has been given some critical revision since it was not a favorite upon its original spring of '79 release. I don't particularly like it all that much though it does seem more commercial than either `Low' or `'Heroes'' at first listen. No instrumentals but definitely not a conventional rock album (would anyone of expected that of David at the end of the Seventies anyway? Doubt it).  There were hits; \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\", \\"Look Back in Anger\\" and \\"DJ\\" are all very good if not great songs. Opener \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" is also decent and \\"Move On\\" is like an avant guard blues which makes it pretty cool. Other than that, unless you are a big world music fan, you may not rave about `Lodger' but it was still Bowie's golden age and he could do very little wrong.

B001C09KD0|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love is a well written book that contains not only a close look at the writer's journey to emotional and spiritual healing after her divorce, but readers also journey with her through the three countries through which her quest takes her.  Elizabeth Gilbert includes vivid details about the cultures of Italy, India and Bali that help her readers see the places and understand how they help her transformation from despondency to joy. I highly recommend Eat, Pray, Love.
B00005JM02|5.0|What a wonderful movie! I purchased this DVD to watch with my grandson who is 3 years old. He was mesmerized with the vibrant colors and talking fish. Great movie for kids and adults alike.
0547258305|4.0|From the back cover:  In a world where people born with an exceptional skill, known as a Grace, are both feared and exploited, Katsa carries the burden of a skill even she despises: the Grace of killing. Feared by the court and shunned by those her own age, the darkness of her Grace casts a heavy shadow over Katsa's life. Yet she remains defiant; when the King of Lienid's father is kidnapped she investigates, and stumbles across a mystery. Who would want to kidnap the old man, and why? And who was the extraordinary Graced man whose fighting abilities rivalled her own? The only thing Katsa is sure of is that she no longer wants to kill. The intrigue around this kidnapping offers her a way out - but little does she realise, when she takes it, that something insidious and dark lurks behind the mystery. Something spreading from the shadowy figure of a one-eyed king... With elegant, evocative prose and a cast of unforgettable characters, Kristin Cashore creates a mesmerising world, a death-defying adventure, and a heart-racing romance that will captivate you, and leave you wanting more.    Review:  I'm so glad I bought a copy because I loved this book. It had such a clearly defined tone that was maintained throughout the whole book without wavering. I think this happens when an author knows their characters and the world they live in like the back of their hand. The whole time I was reading it I felt like I was a child in a village in some distant land and time listening to the local storyteller sitting by a fire on a cold winter night telling a favourite story. Katsa is an awesome female protagonist (no whiny, weak, need a man to rescue her here), and the relationships between the characters are a little more on the realistic side. There are some dark and heavy themes covered here, but are done well in a way that is sensitive to a young adult audience (or even younger).     I'm really looking forward to reading <span style=\\"font-style:italic;\\">Fire</span> now, and willbe keeping my eyes open for any news about the third book which according to Kristin Cashore's website may be released sometime at some stage.

B002UXRGLG|4.0|Like Planet Earth, the photography is spectacular.  But for my taste, there was too much emphasis on insects.  I would not have purchased it if David Attenborough had not narrated - not an Oprah fan.

B0036EH3X4|5.0|Okay, so LOST is not perfect. It had some inconsistencies and faults throughout its six year run, but it's almost inevitable when you're trying to tell a story this large. Because of the grandiose story that unfolds in this show, I can easily see past the minor mistakes the show made. LOST was so wildly ambitious and unique that it's hard not to love. I know many people would disagree with me, many were disappointed by the lack of answers given to the many mysteries presented throughout the show, but I think most of these people were watching for the wrong reasons. If your only interest in the show is seeing the mysteries cleared up, just stop watching. Yes, the island and its strange happenings played a big part in the show, but just like our survivors, we never are able to find out EVERYTHING. But that's perfectly fine with me because the island possesses magical properties and things happen not always with reason.    This season may not have been perfect, it had some issues in the first half of the season. But by the time we reach the halfway mark, particularly an episode called \\"Ab Aeterno\\", the show picks up and doesn't let us catch our breath until the amazing final moments of the series.    Ever since the finale aired on TV, LOST has been glued in the mind and I think back on the whole experience very fondly. This was truly a magical, one-of-a-kind show that will never be reproduced or equaled in terms of scope, originality, and gripping storytelling. If you go into it with an open mind, not expecting every little mystery to be solved and a suspension of disbelief, this final chapter will draw you in and blow your mind.

B000025INU|3.0|It's 1975 folks...the acid has worn off, my older brothers have cut their hair and gone to grad school, and  Gong has released Shamal.  Life progresses.  I liked Shamal in `75; I still do after more years than I'd like to admit, and it still intrigues and annoys me as it did way back when.  This is a pretty good album, but what is it with the stupid lyrics?  Didn't they go away in the 60s?  The instrumentals Bambooji and Mandrake are absolute works of art (Mandrake still makes me very sad).  The transition from Bambooji to instrumental Cat in Clark's Shoes is rough, but when originally released on vinyl, there was a pause as you flipped the record over.  Shamal is a great piece of music with unnecessary but mostly ignorable vocals.    Changing hats to audiophile jerk, this is a very well recorded studio album with really unique (translate: odd) mixing and use of compression.  The electric guitar crescendo on Bambooji is never really allowed to take hold, yet the wooden flute just about knocks you over backwards.  Having someone shouting lyrics so quietly you can't understand them in Shamal is kindof interesting once, but I wish they would go away.    If only they had restricted the (non lyrical) vocals to Bambooji, this would be a great album.
B001QOGYBI|2.0|I bought this movie to show to a group of kids for a Parent's Night Out event at church.   I had my 9 year old son preview it for me and when he told me I probably shouldn't show it  I thought I better watch it.  He was right.  They say cuss a lot and a movie about a lying, stealing fox  would not have been a good choice to show to a group of young church kids.  Had to go a different route  for the evening movie.
0399156577|4.0|The Red Scarf Killer murdered twelve twentyish women before he abducted Fiona Bristow, tied her up and tossed her into the trunk of his car.  She had a knife on her so was able to get free; Fiona provided the FBI with a description of her kidnapper.  They failed to find him until he snatched Fiona's befriend, killing the caring cop.<br /><br />After much therapy, Fiona starts over on Orcas Island in Puget Sound.  She is a canine search-and-rescue trainer and dog trainer in general who has no plans to have a relationship with artisan Simon Doyle as eight years have passed since her last tragic one ended n his death.  As he creates beautiful furniture, they get to know one another due to his feisty matchmaking puppy.  As their feelings grow, Fiona feels contentment for the first since the Red Scarf serial killings.  However, that ends when the FBI agents arrive to inform her that someone using imprisoned Perry's M.O. is killing young women leaving on their necks the telltale red scarf.  Law enforcement and Fiona believe the copycat killer is coming for her, but this time she will not run from her nightmare; this time she plans to confront her bogeyman.<br /><br />The Search is a strong romantic suspense mostly because of the lead couple's bickering teasing, a strong support cast including an eccentric four legged pup, and the Washington State setting.  The serial killer subplot is not new as the copy cat has been done before, but Nora Roberts makes it seem fresh with her incredible writing skill as she uses the S&R canines as key elements in the exciting story line.  Readers will enjoy Ms. Roberts' entertaining Puget Sound thriller.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I'm happy to say that Predators is the sequel we've been waiting 23 years to see. I watched Predator 2 on Blu-ray the other night and while I think it's underrated by many, even I can't call it a worthy follow-up to the 1987 classic. Predators has more than it's share of copycat moments. The familiar jungle setting, dialogue (\\"over here\\"), music, and even though it's missing that creepy vibe of the original, it's all kinds of fun to watch, especially if you're a fan of the series. Let's just forget those two Alien vs. Predator movies were ever made.<br /><br />Like the original, the team battling the Predators is small enough in size so you get to know them a little bit along the way, but they lack some of the simple charms. The acting may even be better this time around, but it's hard to beat two future governors and Apollo Creed fighting a 7 foot alien. Adrien Brody is one of the last people I would ever think of being an action hero, but he bulked up, put on his best Christian Bale era Batman voice, and pulled it off pretty darn well. Laurence Fishburne isn't in the film as much as the trailers would make you believe, but I liked the weirdness he brought to the role. There wasn't one cast member I hated, so that's always a plus, but I did feel the whole Topher Grace thing was too obvious. I also wish they got more use out of Danny \\"Machete\\" Trejo.<br /><br />We now learn that the Predators themselves are broken down into two classes. The smaller ones we've seen before and look almost identical to the original predator, but the larger ones have a slightly different looking face and one huge lower jaw. At first I was not that crazy about having these different races of Preds fighting each other, as well as, the humans, but the idea grew on me. The creatures themselves look good, but they come across more bulky than agile, especially during the hand to hand fight scenes. At times I thought I was watching the WWE galactic edition.<br /><br />The CGI is good 90% of the time (still not sure about those alien dogs) and unlike Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, you can actually see what's going on in the action sequences. The gore level is average. It would have been nice to see some more creative kills from various Predator weapons, instead of just the wrist blades and shoulder cannons.<br /><br />I still wish Robert Rodriguez would have not only produced, but directed, like he initially planned, but Nimr&oacute;d Antal gives us a film worthy enough to sit beside Predator on my DVD shelf. Now bring on the sequels or I'll really hate that open ending.about those alien dogs) and unlike Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, you can actually see what's going on in the action sequences.

0385341008|5.0|This amazing book was recommended by a friend in such glowing terms, I rushed right home and ordered it from Amazon.com.  I was not disappointed.  Except for having heard the name, I knew nothing of the Island of Guernsey or what took place there during WWII at the hands of the Nazis.  The book is written as a series of letters, an interesting format which is not as awkward as it may sound.  The novel engages the reader from the very first letter.  I picked up the book to read while I ate my lunch one day.  I did not stop reading until 2:00AM when I finished the last letter.  I enjoyed the novel so much, I recommended it to my sister who gave it to her daughter who gave it to HER daughter.  We all loved it so much, it has prompted us to start a book sharing club on Facebook.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|Predators  is the best summer movie so far and one of the best of the year. I'll be honest I've only seen three summer movies. There was Iron Man 2, The A Team and now Predators. It's just been a really Summer for movies. You can just tell by the previews that they aren't going to be remotely good. Now out of the three Predators is the best movie.    Predators harkens back to the first Predators movie. Breaking from the recent horrible Alien Vs Predator movies. The movie has the same feel as the first movie. It also has the same kind of set up a group off harden killers try to survive against a group of Predators. I had some lingering doubts that this movie would be good but I was wrong, it was great. It had a great premise. Instead of hunting on Earth the Predators take humans to another planet. A planet wide game preserve where the Predators hone their skills.    The characters introductions won't surprise to many people. The loner but reluctant leader. The man with a family. The silent warrior. It goes on from there. There is one character you won't be able to read, because he just doesn't belong with the group which was a nice twist. The actors from Adrien Brody and Topher Grace  to Alice Braga and Danny Trejo all did really good jobs with their characters. The only person I had a problem with and the only real problem I had with the movie was Noland (Laurence Fishburne). What was the point of his character except to movie the plot along and they really didn't need him for that. And I like the actor too. He almost always plays interesting characters. It's just in this movie he was pointless.    The action and special effects were truly well done. There were many great scenes. But my favorite had to be the scene between Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and one of the predators. I won't give anything away but it was one of the best if not the best scenes of the movie.    The ending of the movie was open ended which I really liked. There's so many directions they cantake this franchise as long as they don't go back to the Alien Vs Predator type of movie I think I'll be happy. Overall this is a excellent movie. Out of the three Predator movies (I just chose to believe the AVP movies never existed) I would have to say this is the second best movie. It was ha hard choice between the first one and this one but I just love the Arnold and the cast of the first movie more. In fact all the Predator movies were great it's just that the first one was the best.    Predator 5/5    Predators 5/5    Predators 2 4.5/5
014241543X|4.0|If I Stay is a beautiful story full of questions, hard decisions, emotions and basically soaked with sadness. Prepare the tissues because you are going to need them.    In the first chapter we meet Mia and her family. Due to a snowfall the classes are suspended and they decide to pick the car.     The result is obvious: they have an accident and her live is about to change forever. Mia is aware of all that happens around her and since she can still listen to the radio she thinks it wasnt very serious, she's wrong. She discovers her father, her mother and herself lying on the ground and they look really bad.    When the medical team arrive they move Mia to a hospital. But Mia is not really inside her body, she is a mere observer of everything that will happen around her.    Little by little we will see fragments of her past, touching little stories that will encourage or discourage her to stay alive. After all, she must decide whether to stay or not in this world. It's a tough decision to leave behind her friends and her boyfriend, but if she stays she will have to put up with the loss of her family. Will choose the easy way or the most complicated one?     It's a beautiful story despite being quite sad. The author has managed to blend perfectly the past and the present and even its a sad story i've smiled once or twice.     In general, it is a very delicate issue and I like the way the author has dealt with it in so few pages. She has managed to create a story that hooks you from the beginning.    If you want to read a shocking story, realistic and very touching, this book is made for you.

193413712X|4.0|I paid no attention to Paul Harding's debut novel, Tinkers, until it won the Pulitzer prize, when it roused my curiosity. Harding's talent soars in his choice of language and in his creation of a tone and setting that never misses a beat. As George Crosby lies dying, his memories provide the novel's momentum, and the lives and relationships of every character come to live thanks to Harding's fine craftsmanship. Any reader who enjoys the art of fine writing will especially appreciate this novel.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B001GCUO5M|4.0|I found this movie to be un-nerving and, at times, more that a little confusing.  It was occasionally difficult for me to determine when I was watching scenes from the past or in the present.  However, having said that, I must go on to say that all of the performances are excellent, especially DiCaprios and Ben Kingsleys.  The script, though confusing, is nonetheless well written and the production values are top-notch - as one has come to expect from a Scorsese film.  A perfect depiction of what it would be like to be a visitor stranded on a rain soaked island, in an asylum staffed by a sordid and disturbing cast of characters.
1421532255|5.0|This book is an alternative version of events that occur after Light fails and L survives.  There is a lot of L, and only a few mentions of Misa and Light.     If you are not familiar with Death Note, this book may be 3 stars, as it is an easy read with some humor.  Although, it is hard to find sympathy in a villain who goes as far as injecting a 10 year old girl/hostage with a lethal virus.  The girl is saved, but is also as big a hero as L it turns out.    If you love L from Death Note, this is the book for you.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|Season 4 of Supernatural is just GREAT!  Each season builds upon the previous seasons to highten the excitment and anticipation in the lives and \\"hunts\\" of Dean and Sam.  These two brothers are so fun to watch, as we see their relationship and journey develop.  It is scarey, yet you have to watch as you root for the brothers to prevail over \\"evil\\" and protect one another, no matter what.  The humor that catches the viewer off guard is awesome, while the special effects and sheer scariness is high tech and spectacular!  I love it!!  Waiting for the 5th Season to come out, so I can watch it again.  Supernatural is the BEST!  Can't wait for the new season to start!!!
B003JZT2AW|4.0|With Oasis disbanding this year, it only makes sense for the band and record label to put out a collection like \\"Time Flies 1994-2009.\\" Unlike the previous compilation, \\"Stop the Clocks,\\" (which was a best of retrospective of tracks picked by the band that included various B-sides and the like) \\"Time Flies\\" is essentially their greatest hits (minus the beautiful \\"Sunday Morning Call\\" which, for some reason, was left off the CDs but the music video in on the DVD, go figure.) TONS of gems are here and included, for the very FIRST time ever on an Oasis album, \\"Whatever.\\"    From the wild introduction of songs from their debut album (\\"Cigarettes & Alcohol,\\" \\"Supersonic\\") to their more layered and atmospheric tracks from their last studio release (\\"Falling Down\\") to the non-album singles (like the aforementioned \\"Whatever\\" and also \\"Lord Don't Slow Me Down\\" which much like the former, is debuting for the first time ever on an Oasis album) you pretty much have everything that sums up the band's wildly popular career (though more so internationally than in America.)    \\"Time Flies\\" also features (but only in the box set) the band's final live concert and a DVD compiling all of their music videos for the very first time with the bonus of watching them with a commentary track by Noel himself!    Frankly I can't think of a better release to encapsulate a band's hit making career than this box set. Everyone involved did a top notch job of putting the essentials on here (but again, not including the hit single \\"Sunday Morning Call\\" was a crime.)    Highly recommended!
B0015AARJI|3.0|It's a good controller at first, being lightweight and responsive, but it is more for the casual gamer who plays maybe 1-2 hours a week. The first problem I noticed was that the joysticks get worn out really easy. They get really loose, and for one of my controllers, it has got to the point where I have to push it up so far that the characters in the game can't run. Of course, the only way to fix this is to buy a new controller. I've went through two controllers like this, and the same thing kept happening. I had my PS2 controller for seven years, and it still functions like new. These controllers last 1-2 years, but only if you take breaks for long periods of time. Unfortunately, there isn't a good alternative at this point in time, so this has to do. A shame, considering how useful the PS3 system is.

030726999X|4.0|Lisbeth Salander, shot at the end of `The Girl Who Played With Fire', is flown to hospital where she undergoes surgery.  After the surgery, she is moved into an intensive care ward and isolated from visitors until she is well enough to face trial.  Behind the scenes, `the Section' responsible for managing Zalachenko since his defection are working hard to undo the damage caused by the current Zalachenko affair.  Key to this cover-up is maintaining the position that Lisbeth Salander is mentally unstable and needs to be institutionalised.<br /><br />In the meantime, Mikael Bloomkvist and others are working hard to prove Salander's innocence by uncovering the conspiracy within the Swedish secret service which has protected Zalachenko and persecuted Salander.  Salander may be isolated in hospital, but she is not friendless or without resources.<br /><br />And then, finally, there is the trial in which the various parts come together in a largely satisfying conclusion.  There's plenty of action in this final instalment of The Millennium Trilogy, not all elements of which is resolved.  I found some aspects irritating because they were distracting and ultimately they did not seem relevant.  But who knows, really, what Stieg Larsson intended after the trilogy was completed?<br /><br />I would not recommend reading the trilogy out of order: the development of characters and story is incremental.  The satisfaction of the ending relies very much on travelling the journey with Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Bloomkvist.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith

0061438294|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  Speed reading people?  It was simplistic and if you think about it, common knowledge.  I took speed reading people to mean apparently much more than what was presented.  The book has a chapter on detecting deception - it elaborates on spotting nonverbal cues that someone is uncomfortable - thus, possibly lying.  What is presented is simplistic and obvious.  This book is disappointing and a waste of money.  The only benefit I can see from it: it is ideal for someone who has had limited interaction with other people.  For example, someone who has cut himself off from human contact from childhood into adulthood.

B002VECLVO|4.0|Fashion designer Tom Ford forays into film directing with \\"A Single Man\\", inspired by Christopher Isherwood's 1964 novel and co-written and bankrolled by Ford as well. It's Friday, November 30, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, but George Falconer (Colin Firth), an expatriate English professor living in Southern California, is embarking on what he hopes will be the last day of an ongoing personal crisis. Eight months ago, his lover of 16 years, Jim (Matthew Goode), was killed in an auto accident. Every day since has been a haze. But George has decided that today will be different. Today he will kill himself. He lectures his English class on Huxley and has dinner with best friend Charley (Julianne Moore), but a persistent student named Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) has noticed George's cloud of gloom and decided the professor is worth knowing.<br /><br />With Tom Ford at the helm, I feared style over substance -and style that might be a bit tired. The photography and production design are a prominent element. I especially enjoyed George's modernist house tucked away in the post-War suburbs. George's meticulousness is reflected in the visual style, and it's easy to see what attracted Ford to this character. But style, though sometimes conspicuously prettified, does not overwhelm George's crisis or the audience's empathy. Much credit for that feat is due Colin Firth, who received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and BAFTA award for his role. His performance is understated -all in the face, really. Julianne Moore is also terrific. George's encounters with young men feel stilted. Stylistic flourishes and the film's score are sometimes heavy-handed. But \\"A Single Man\\" is well worth a viewing.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2010): Bonus features are \\"The Making of A Single Man\\" (16 min) and an audio commentary by Tom Ford. The documentary, which is black-and-white, interviews Ford about themes and the cast about their characters and Ford's direction.

B002L31R8I|5.0|Ariana Savall has taken the poetry of Garcia Lorca, Juan de la Cruz, Francis of Assisi, Rumi and Rilke and infused the lyrics with music that compliments every word.  Through this album, Savall has introduced me to Catalan, Portugese and other Spanish poets.   A language experience that a polyglot would extol, because the well-translated lyrics (translations in 6 languages)are included in the attached booklet.  This is more than a recording and cannot be duplicated by downloading onto MP3.  This exceptional package is both a listening and reading experience.    The music is diverse: ancient, celtic, contemporary, folk and classical.  The performers are extraordinary, particularly the clarity of Ariana's beautifully pitched voice.     The CD is 78:19 minutes and nothing negative can be found in that time.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|Of all the Predator themed films that have been made since the original, most have simply either placed them in new suroundings or have expanded on the ever growing mythos of their savage hunting culture. But with PREDATORS, director Anwar Nidal takes them back to their roots.  In the first film, Schwartzenegger battled the solo Predator in a manner that clearly delineated the gap between the fighting skills of humanity's best and those of an alien breed.  What Arnold taught us is that these intergalactic trophy hunters were fierce fighters indeed but were singularly lacking in that immortal spark that we call inspiration.  In PREDATORS, Adrien Brody takes up where Arnold left off.  Both films begin on a similar note. A group of experienced combat veterans, hit men, and assorted human predators gather in a jungle setting to square off against a trio of totally vicious aliens who prize trophy heads even over their own lives.  How these human killers arrive is of no consequence.  The film does little more than simply to have them literally fall out of the sky.  As they land, they meet, they squabble but quickly realize that their only collective chance to survive is to co-operate.  Most of them are dramatic straw men, designed only to show one particular type of human being. Their is Alice Braga, a butt kicking woman assassin who takes an instant distrust to Brody.  There is Danny Trejo, a Columbian Medelin hit man. Most of the other actors are unknown, except for a brief appearance midway by Lawrence Fishburne who suggests that his own interaction with the beasties implies that the millennia long history of humanity is intertwined with that of the Predators.  In the original PREDATOR as with this one, the function of this race of head hunters is to point out that they exist on some deep primordial level as the avatars of humanity's need to have a devil figure to function as a pure metaphor of our own need dominate others. And domination requires proof as such.  With Predators, this proof is akin to our own lamentable custom of taking scalps, in this case skulls.  PREDATORS is an action film that nevertheless succeeds in suggesting that there is no basic difference between the human version of headhunters and the alien, except that even in the most degenerate of humans, there yet exists a spark of humanity and co-operation that sets us off from them.  We may take the screaming heads of our own victims as do they but we can question the need to do so.  They, on the other hand, live for these trophies. PREDATORS permits the audience to enjoy a thrill a minute ride while simultaneously suggesting that this thrill need not define us as a species.Predators, this proof is akin to our own lamentable custom of taking scalps, in this case skulls.

0743487486|5.0|I recommend this book to every parent I meet. I recieved it as a gift whe I was pregnant from a friend with two children and felt it changed his life. Alfie Kohn simply teaches us to look at our children as beautiful, independent little beings that deserve the same respect we offer to our friends. If you treat your child respectfully, are honest and use reason instead of reward and punishment, you will raise a happier, more cooperative, confident and respectful child. And he packs the book with countless scientific research to support his theories.  This book by no means tells you to allow your child to do whatever they want, however punishment or removing your love is not the way to teach a child a lesson. And rewards to acheive the behavior you want teaches a child to relay on external sources to feel good about themselves. If you teach your child their goal is to please you, someday they may be looking to gain approval from peers in the same way.   This book has even helped my reason with my two year old son, reducing tantrums and changing unpleasant behavior quickly because he understands why we are asking him not to do something, not because he has to sit in time out.  He is more cooperative because he is often allowed to make decisions and exert his independence.  Teachers at his daycare as well as many other people who meet our son often tell us he is one of the happiest children they have met.
B001O54NKS|5.0|Dokken is one of the best groups from the early 1990's and are still kicking out the jams. This album is very good. George's guitar techniques are up there with Yngwie Malmsteen. All the songs on the album are very good and it shows the various ranges Don's voice has. This album is still thrilling to listen to.

B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I ordered Mamma Mia listed as \\"new from manufacturer\\" and the seller accidentally pulled one that was \\"previously viewed\\" and sent it to me. When I notified them of the error they worked quickly and kindly to replace the item immediately. The new copy arrived in just a couple of days. I couldn't have been more satisfied because this was an honest mistake that they sought to correct as soon as possible and with sincere apology. This was only a $7 item, yet it mattered to them that the order be fullfilled properly. Hoorah for their customer service and putting that first - rare these days!
B002ZG97RE|3.0|The best scene in \\"Green Zone\\" is the first one: As the United States' \\"Shock and Awe\\" campaign grips Baghdad in 2003, an Iraqi general named Al Rawi, standing in the equivalent of a throne room, scribbles a final furious note before he's whisked away to safety. In the midst of this bombing, a plot seems to be forming. What is it? The general's party drives into the night, and director Paul Greengrass pulls back his camera to reveal the city under siege, as thin, orange spears of fire with gray mushroom tops dot the landscape, a few luxury trucks and cars skittering to some underground location.     It's a moment worthy of \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" crossed with the political intrigue Greengrass captures with a journalist's detail. Amidst chaos - a story is afoot.     But what follows is an action movie in grad school loafers, packed to the gills with \\"authentic,\\" technocratic details rushing across the lens of Greengrass' camera. \\"Green Zone\\" has a point in mind - that the U.S. government made up evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to invade the country and impose an America-friendly democracy in the Middle East - and the perfect liberal, All-American actor to carry out the mission in Matt Damon. In other words, it is a eight-minute read in the Sunday New York Times stretched out to two hours and populated with guns, helicopters, chases and Damon playing a Commando Will Hunting, a know-it-all gleam in his eyes.     Which isn't a problem if Greengrass had chosen to create a visual commentary that mirrored the movie's opening scene and stood apart from Brian Helgeland's screenplay, rather than running two inches off Damon's tail for the entire film. Or perhaps it's Helgeland heeling at the feet of Greengrass, who got to shoot this vanity project in exchange for considering to direct the fourth \\"Bourne\\" picture. Either way, it's another news story playing Iraqi War games, with a fantasy epilogue that frankly undercuts the enormity of America's con - if so you're inclined to believe there was one. \\"Green Zone\\" has not a moment of irony or levity - just cool, camo-colored outrage.     Damon is Roy Miller, a Chief Warrant Officer looking for WMD. We see a search raid complicated by looting; the unit finds nothing but pigeon poop. The intelligence is wrong, Miller announces during a briefing for a visiting general, who doesn't know or particularly care. But CIA agent Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson, miscast) pulls Miller aside and hands him his card. Later, he'll recruit Miller for a mission to capture Al Rawi (Igor Naor) - one of Saddam Hussein's most brutal generals. But not to torture him.     Miller traces the WMD puzzle to a conflicted Wall Street Journal reporter (Amy Ryan) and finally some Bush administration lackey named Clark Poundstone, played by Greg Kinnear as one of those annoyed think-tank nerds who operates in a vacuum of buzz words and political ideals despite the war unfolding in front of him. Like most movies set during the second Iraq War, \\"Green Zone\\" supplies Miller with an Arabic sidekick, this one named Freddy (Khalid Abdulla), who serves as the \\"conscience of Iraq,\\" interjecting mirthless platitudes about Iraqi self-determination. He's an essentially a gun that been introduced onstage; eventually, you know he'll go off.     \\"Green Zone\\" is complex, but not mysterious; we know where Miller is headed, and so do the characters in the movie, creating a kind of split-second photo finish. At times Greengrass presents military tracking technology as omniscient beyond reason; urban warfare is not really the video game the climax suggests. Damon proved during the \\"Bourne\\" trilogy that he's up for the physical challenge, but his Miller is irascible and smug in emotionally. His final salvo, via email, is followed by a shot of him looking resolute while riding off in the desert; it's patently ridiculous, given what's in that email - and what faces him when he returns from patrol.     On-location shoots in Spain, Moroccoand England drove the film's budget to $100 million; Greengrass will be lucky to recoup half of that despite peddling ads during the Super Bowl. The movie was box-office poison, to the chagrin of some critics, and the delight of political conservatives. Commercial and critical considerations should rarely merge; indeed, they're often locked in a zero-sum game. But \\"Green Zone\\" belongs to a growing subset of war films rejected almost in reflex by moviegoers, who are unwilling to fork over a ten spot for a current affairs lesson. Funny, fickle folks that they are - they happen to be right about \\"Green Zone, which claims thriller status but, stripped down, is nothing more than a scolding. Whether America's earned a tongue lashing is no longer at question; rather - is there any great usefulness (or entertainment) in repeatedly seeing it?

0618918248|1.0|Whenever someone mentions Richard Dawkins' book `The God Delusion' I can't stop the refrain from the Pet Shop Boys song `Seriously' echoing in my head.  The refrain aimed originally at fellow pop stars such as Bono and Sting goes, `How can you expect to be taken seriously?'   Here are ten reasons why I'm unable to take Richard Dawkins seriously    1) I suspect he has a black belt in Origami.   He never tires of making paper tigers which, when complete, he mauls in ruthless Serengeti fashion.  I read the first 100 pages of the `God Delusion' wondering where this scientific genius (yes, he is that) finds the time to write such meandering twaddle.   Even when he does gets started I found nothing more than a dismissal of tired arguments reputable theologians haven't taken seriously for many years.   Russell's Cosmic Teapots?  Give me a (tea) break - please!     2) He fails to properly acknowledge that religious faith cannot be proven.  If we could prove God's existence then we would be compelled to follow not our own plan for our lives life but God's.   At the very core of Christian belief is the idea that we must be free to choose to accept or decline God's involvement in our lives.  If religion is so vacuous then surely the world's great geniuses could demonstrate that view.     3) He shies away from serious debate with top-line theologians or philosophers.  Why does he constantly seek out fundamentalists (usually American televangelists) to ridicule when it would be easier to engage with someone like Richard Swinburne of Oxford University.  Isn't Dawkins an emeritus professor at Oxford?  I'm sure they could easily arrange a meeting or a debate for the enrichment of their students.    Go for it, Mr. Dawkins, at least show your own students that truth matters and that you are match for anyone - or do you perhaps fear that you aren't?   I know which Richard I have more respect for.   4) He falsely sees faith schools as having an indoctrinating agenda.  How can you forcechildren who spend most of their day studying science, math, languages, history, politics, art, and history to uncritically believe anything we teach in religion classes?   Most of us who teach religious education don't even try or want to indoctrinate.   Those who do are quickly dismissed as `wackjobs' by the smarter students.   Those of us who care about religious education have spent many years, largely without success, trying to ensure that religion is taught by specialists.   In most schools I've worked in people who go to church on Sundays are considered competent enough to reach R.E.   Dept chairs in science or math would have a fit if their subjects were so casually treated.   When students have to miss a class to see their guidance counselor or have school photos taken it's invariably religious studies they are forced to miss.   If Dawkins spent any time in an Advanced Level theology class he would see that few teachers ever claim these days that the bible is meant to be taken literally.   The students in those classes are encouraged to adopt a far more critical approach to religion than they do in, say, history classes where few students ever seriously question whether or not Caesar or Hannibal ever existed.  I know all too well the abuses of religion past and present and I'm as quick as anyone to point those mistakes of the past out to those who care to listen.   By the way, the faith schools save America a fortune.   If we didn't educate those children it would cost the taxpayers many billions to replace our schools which get no financial help whatsoever.  In the UK the govt pays faith schools only to pay for their education - the Church foots the 15% bill for the religious education element, not the taxpayer.   Dawkins either doesn't know that or he deliberately ignores it.  5) Like Freud, Marx, and other post-modernists from the past his obvious contempt for religion and his jaundiced view of it forces him to abandon all pretense of objectivity.   Themethods that he and his scientific colleagues so rightly treasure can be abandoned for one subject only: religion.   He also makes the same mistake of taking the very worst of religious practice and dressing it up as religion per se.  Look what happens when we take religion out of society and replace it with Marxism or fascism?  I'm glad to live in a society that allows us freedom to choose our own way of life, even when it includes the right to lambast peoples' treasured religious beliefs.   Perhaps Dawkins should spend a few years living in a country where any disagreement with its secular leader's worldview leads to the death camps.   His unbridled faith in the power of reason alone to create a just society is risible and cannot be historically substantiated.  Religion has done more to humanize this world than any other comparable force.   Where are the dedicated atheist outreach programs for the poor and marginalized?   (Yes, I do realize there are organizations like Amnesty and the Red Cross around the world doing amazing things but atheism isn't their inspiration.  I also recognize that these organizations would be less effective if many religious people didn't support and fund them).     6) What if, like America, we all agreed to take religious studies off the daily curriculum?   Wouldn't that suggest to children without any knowledge of religious beliefs that science alone is able to explain creation and that religious instruction of any kind is somewhat subversive or dangerous - hence the protection of young minds?   Dawkins surely wouldn't allow his own children to relate to any kind of religious inclinations since he doesn't believe in them.  So, as father he must be instructing his children to have a worldview that excludes religion as having any real value - so much for his passionate argument for children's rights to make choices.   (`Daddy, I'm hearing voices in my head telling me to do good and care for others'   hmmmm).    He wants to limit their choices to scientific ones, even though the age of our universe in my lifetime has grown from about 4 billion years to 13.7 billion.   What will our scientists be saying a hundred years from now?  Dawkins doesn't accept as valid any child's view that God created the world or that Jesus Christ is its greatest hope for survival beyond this earthly existence.  Dawkins wants us all to accept his view that we cannot survive our earthly existence.  He won't be satisfied until we all endure the kind of existential angst that obviously troubles him.  Unlike Jesus, he cannot accept the rejection of his worldview like a man of true fortitude, courage, and grace.    7) Dawkins really ought to study the works of great theologians with more care.  Sixteen hundred years ago St Augustine wrote `where religion or the bible is in conflict with reputable science it is religion or the bible that must be changed not the science.'  It was the Catholic Church that did more than anyone to create the modern education system that we have today.   Who started the university system that Dawkins and many others have enjoyed throughout their lives?   It was in fact the Catholic Church that Dawkins despises so much.  That's not a Catholic teaching by the way, it's a historical fact.  I shudder to think what our world would be like had it not been for the efforts of church leaders envisioning and championing a right to an education for all regardless or color, race or creed.    8) Dawkins has a strange view of religious protectionism.   Where in the free world does religion enjoy any viable form of protection?   Yes, we are allowed to build churches so long as we can afford them and we are allowed to practice our faith.  But that is part of a natural freedom that western democracies allow, it isn't protectionism.   America is often described as the land of the free and yet we won't allow religious education in our schools.   In stark contrast to Dawkins, I think that those who espouse explicit religious beliefs are more likely to encounter prejudice and discrimination from their superiors.   Who wants a bank manager who insists that customers must accrue wealth only by strict moral standards?   Who needs a surgeon who stands up for the rights of the unborn?   Who needs a store manager who refuses to accept the `happy holiday' directive of his superiors in favor of the `Happy Christmas' alternative?    TV and radio presenters and journalists never last long if they have discernable religious leanings.     9) The one thing I have to admire about religious folk generally is their devotion to care for the outcast members of society.   There are countless thousands of outreach charities around the world selflessly serving millions of people because they believe their faith encourages them to care for the less fortunate.   What does Dawkins do for others?   Jesus once said, `by their fruits ye shall know them'.  What does Dawkins do for others less fortunate than himself?   If he gave away everything he had for his beliefs then I might admire him as much as I do the great saints like St Francis of Assisi.     10) Finally, I've come to realize that dictators suppress religious leaders not because they are able to turn people into simpletons (they aren't); but because they realize that the masses will see them in all their shallow glory when they compare them (Hitler, Stalin, Mao) to Jesus Christ the greatest person who ever lived.   Dawkins the genius v Jesus the great - who are you listening to?        Whatever else the Dawkins Delusion is, it's certainly not a great book.  By the way, you Dawkins fans out there really should read the `Dawkins Delusion' and then tell me how brilliant Dawkins is outside of his own field.   He should stick to what he's great at rather than the childish polemics that intelligent Christians grate at.

B000002JEV|5.0|The title says it all. For Zepheads this is a must. They're all great but for me the stand out track has got to be \\"Thank you\\" on disc 2. The first time I heard it I had that rare feeling of having experienced something of historical significance that it practically moved me to tears (I've had similar experiences when listening to the 1st movement of Mahler's 1st Symphony, seeing the original of \\"The Scream\\" for the first time, finishing Mishima's \\"The Sea of Fertility: and listening to Woody Allen's \\"Moose sketch\\"). Actually, the first time I heard this track I was onthe London Underground and I was so blown away that I listened to it 3 times in succession and completely missed my stop. It's probably the best guitar solo that Page every played. 'Nuff said. Buy 10 copies of this album, \give the \ 9 to people you love or who you hope will love you soon, keep the other one yourself and play it until you wear it out. Then buy another one.

B002VPE1X4|5.0|The camera case is capable of toting many small and personal electronics.  I like the softness of the weather resistant fabric called Neoprene.  The soft case features a hand wrist strap, which appears to be durable enough for general activity.  Also there is a belt loop plus, with a small ring hook, I attach a key holder that attaches quickly to a belt loop without using the belt strap.<br /><br />The fit is comfortable around the waist.  I have slipped it onto the belt loop of pants and frequently use the case for my cell phone.  The smaller Ipod fits easily, plus, the outer pocket fits a small pair of reading glasses for reading the Ipod. The case holds my Nano Ipod plus the larger Ipod with a thicker skin covering. I have also used this for the small FLIP camera when I need it.<br /><br />This is handy, attractive, comfortable and efficient and lightweight. The only drawback is the color black.  When I put this into my bag, it is difficult to locate, to spot within the purse/bag.  A bright color would be preferable. ......Rizzo

0307454541|5.0|Call me narrow-minded if you will but I usually do not like non-American English books especially translated books.  I tend to lean towards books that I have some point of reference to and can relate to, even if it is just the written vernacular.  That stated, \\"The Millennium Trilogy\\" as \\"the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\"; \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\" translated by Reg Keeland (aka Steven T. Murray) have come to be known by is extraordinary.  The locale - Sweden - was a little difficult.  There were a lot of very unfamiliar town and place names that were unknown and unpronounceable to me.  But it didn't seem to matter as I read.  The story pulled me along.  I liked the translation (I guess some people haven't) but maybe I don't know enough to know better.  I just know that Larsson's books, through Keeland, were astonishingly clear and flowed easily.<br /> SPOILER ALERT:<br />Violent, disturbing, gut wrenching -- yes, all of these things and more.  I would not consider these for children to read at all.  Just about every type of abuse is written about VERY graphically in these books.  But the subjects are not being glorified - far from it. They are included to explain and clarify the near destruction of a human being and her triumph in spite of all.<br /><br />\\"Tattoo\\" I liked probably the best.  It read like an old fashioned English murder mystery to me updated to the 21st century.  Genius heroine who is very hard to like at times, abuse, serial killer, unusual sleeping arrangements (I'm sure to some).<br /><br />\\"Fire\\" was very graphic.  Gore, abuse, lesbian sex, insane villains, skewed senses of right and wrong in the bad guys AND the good guys. But compelling and explains a lot of the other two books.<br /><br />\\"Hornets\\" started out slow for me.  I guess after the roller coaster ride of the first two books, when this one started out at a more normal pace it seemed to drag.  But persevere because it is definitely worth it.  There is a lot of politics/history at the beginning of this book.  Larsson was an investigative journalist and you can see some of that more clearly in this book.<br /><br />Larsson died too young - of a heart attack.  I have read (and of course I believe everything I read) that he was almost finished with book four of this series with books 5-10 outlined but because of inheritance issues it is unlikely that any more will be published.  The world lost a true literary treasure when Stieg Larsson died.  A lot of people aren't going to want to read his books -too violent, too painful.

B003A4IFDW|2.0|I sense there is a movement to give Bettye Lavette the recognition she should have received earlier in her career, and I really, really wanted to like this album, but unfortunately it doesn't deserve the accolades.  First, too many dirges - and many of the slow songs are paced even more slowly than the originals.  The album drags, badly. Second, too many rasping, tortured vocals which, combined with the lack of variety in tempos, eventually seem monotonous and nearly monotone. There are two songs I like very much:  \\"The Word,\\" which is the only really cooking soul workout on the album (if only there were more like this), and \\"It Don't Come Easy,\\" which imbues Ringo's poppy original with real emotional weight. Other than those two, I would rather listen to the far superior originals of every song on this album, including the over-rated Kennedy Center performance of The Who classic (maybe you have to see it).  I have ordered the re-release of her 70s album \\"Do Your Duty\\" from Amazon and judging from the samples, I think I'll like it a lot better.  It appears to be Bettye in her prime and in her element.
B0030Y11XS|2.0|This is Michael Moore's template for making a documentary: show some unfortunate end results of some kind of system, then dismiss the whole system outright.     What people like Moore don't take into account is human nature. He brings up the example of Jonas Salk, who selflessly worked to create a polio vaccine. Wonderful. If everyone was so unselfish and dedicated, maybe we could be communists.    He also brings up examples of companies who operate more like a co-op. I love the idea. Are there many entrepeneurs who would risk their fortunes to start a company, in which there isn't the promise of gargantuan return? I doubt it. I wish that weren't the case, but it is.    People look out for themselves and their families. Is that good or bad? I don't know. But it's reality. It's the result of eons of evolution.    Why would I take a huge risk to start a business that could fail and potentially cost me tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars? Is it because I'm like Jonas Salk, and will work tirelessly and without thought of myself, because I believe so strongly in my widget? No, it's because having more personal wealth is a good thing. It means I can travel more. I can give my kids a better education. I can retire without worrying about whether I live long enough to outlast my money.     And as a byproduct, others would benefit from my wealth. That's right, economics isn't about one pie that stays the same size, and being wealthy means I take a bigger piece of the pie, leaving others with less. Wealthy people make the pie bigger, so that everyone gets more.    I don't dismiss the examples shown in the movie...they are the unfortunate results of selfishness gone bad. Would those exact stories be replicated in another economic system, like communism? No. But if we were communists, there would be another Michael Moore making documentaries about all the unfortunate hard luck stories created by communism. I'm guessing the stories would be much worse.       If there is an economic system in which a boatload of people don't get the shaft, I'd love to hear it.
B002XUL85G|2.0|Dull, amateurish horror movie about a young couple in a haunted house.  It feels like it was made by college students- it is simply the young couple running around with a camcorder, screaming at slamming doors etc... I found it just dragged on and on, even though it's actually a short movie.  Same kind of thing as the Blair Witch Project, so if you go in for these zero budget horror movies that try to compensate for their amateurishness by pretending the events portrayed are a 'true story', then you might enjoy this.  People (like me) who prefer movies that actually have a plot, good special effects, and exciting things happen, can safely stay away from this one!

B0009X7664|5.0|It is revealing to look at the archival movie posters included in this edition of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". Watching the film last night (on the 50th anniversary of the publication of the novel), I was intrigued by both the naivete of the film (and the novel), and its frankness and boldness coming at the time of the burgeoning civil rights movement in this country. But the movie posters - which always show Scout and Jem - warned that the film was \\"Not Suitable for Children\\". Looking back over the history of the novel and film, and how the novel, especially, has been embraced by schools and young people, the posters show what a naive and parochial country America still was in 1962 - but not for much longer. But no matter, both are a \\"must read\\" and \\"must watch\\", and will be for generations of young people to come.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|when i first heard this cd, i was kinda thing about her last cd X. I was wondering what way she way gonna go with this new cd. I have to say after many plays i really like it, it reminds me of some of her old stuff, with an update, my fav song is Aphrodite and the first single, All the lovers has a kinda Goldfrapp sound. But it seems like the tail end of this cd looses steam. Songs like better than today, and cant beat the feeling and Looking for an angel sound kinda dated, and not in a good way. These song were well. kinda green for an artist like Kylie. Dont get me wrong, for the most part it is a great cd, just could have been and had a stronger end. The other songs that make this great are Get outta here, Put your hands up which have great club play, and could have great re-mixes, the very ncie and sweet Everything is beautiful along with the nicely Closer. This cd is far more better than poor X-tinas Bionic. what was up with that. had the last few song on this cd been stronger it just would have made it all that better, but all and all, it is worth the money. Got to love Kylie, its just too bad she dose not get my radio play here in the U.S...would love to see a tour in the states, what ya think Kylie. We love you.

B00138J6VM|5.0|I will never have the same understanding for this band that someone who was my age when it came out will. I'll never know that feeling of listening to Stones and Elvis, maybe some Beatles, and hearing this album for the first time and I am genuinely saddened by this realization. One must realize that there is no \\"perfect\\" album without flops. Guns N' Roses came close with Appetite, and Toys has very few, maybe three. What it does have that Guns N' Roses will never hope to see is a few of the most well written songs recorded. Sweet Emotion may be overplayed, however if it is broken down to pieces, there isn't a single piece that couldn't stand alone by itself. Walk This Way needs little if any explanation and the title song never gets old.

0525423842|5.0|My son loved this book. He is 10 yrs.old and has read every Harry Potter book, Anthony Horowitz, Percy Jackson and numerous others of the genre.  He adores reading and all I can say is when he was done(which was in about 3 days)he asked when the next book in the series would be coming out. I think it\\"s absurd for adults to be reviewing this book.  It's not meant for you and a young readers comments should mean more than yours.  Any reading that a child does is wonderful and I applaud Mr.Grishams efforts to appeal to the younger reader.

B003NX76BM|5.0|I loved this book.  Too much dog training, a tree planting paragraph?  Fee is a dog trainer, she's into canine search and rescue.  She is a real person dealing with real life and dog training is a huge part of who she is.  How can you bash who she is?  Romance, threats, a real life story. Nora Roberts created a fine book which I thoroughly enjoyed reading.
B0007939NO|4.0|My favorite poster for the 1954 MGM production of the Lerner and Loewe musical Brigadoon is a bright and vivid one from it's first release in Germany, which is actually ironically appropriate; the 1947 Broadway production that started the ball rolling was in fact based on an original German tale, about a mythical village that fell under a curse and would only reappear once a century.  In 1947, setting such a story in the recently-defeated Germany was deemed inappropriate, and so the highlands of Scotland were substituted, and this setting change was maintained for the film.<br /><br />The production wasn't one of MGM's most expensive or careful, despite the marquee names of Gene Kelly as star/choreographer, the Lerner/Loewe music and Loewe screenpaly, Athur Freed as producer and Vincente Minnelli as director.  Originally supposed to be shot in Scotland, it ended up done entirely on sets due to weather and money concerns, and it was shot in the cheaper and less lush Anscocolor process instead of Technicolor.  With all that in mind though, it's still managed to become something of a classic - perhaps not considered one of the very top musicals of the 50s, but certainly well enough remembered.<br /><br />I suppose a lot of it has to do with the fairytale wish-fulfillment storyline: a couple of Americans, dreamer Tommy Albright (Kelly) and cynical atheist Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson) stumble on the village of Brigadoon on its sole day of existence in a century, and Albright immediately falls in love with Fiona Campbell (Cyd Charisse), older sister of the new bride Jean and the one person in the town willing to talk to the two strangers at first.  It's a Hollywood musical, and we know that Tommy and Fiona will fall in love, and that even when it seems they must separate, somehow, something - some movie or mystical magic - will bring them back together.<br /><br />The film itself has plenty of problems; apart from the sets (which I thought were kind of charming) and the muted, somewhat earthy colors (which aren't terrible, but certainly make me long for Technicolor) it just doesn't seem to have the energy or sense of mystery that such a story demands.  Kelly's singing and dancing are fine, he and Charisse look good together, but something's missing...I think in part it's that everything's too easy.  We have one malcontent who wants to leave the village, which would destroy the magic spell and keep it sleeping forever - but neither he nor the real ramifications of the idea are developed at all.  It's just \\"hey, Tommy Albright, stay in this magical highland village forever and wake up every day a hundred years in the future, won't that be grand?\\".  It's not that it's a bad idea - it's just that everything really has to synch up to make it work, and it doesn't - quite.<br /><br />But the music is great (especially \\"Almost Like Being in Love\\"), Kelly's dances with Charisse are nice, and Van Johnson is really terrific as the cynical buddy, and one thing I really loved is that the film doesn't demonize him - doesn't even say that he makes the wrong choice by being resistant to Brigadoon's charms.  He's just got a different notion of life than Kelly's character, and that's fine.  If the ending, and the film as a whole, are pretty predictable, even a bit trite, well I guess I didn't care.  Count me in as one of those who wants to be the starry-eyed Tommy - even if in reality I can't let go of the cynicism of Jeff.rs (which aren't terrible, but certainly make me long for Technicolor) it just doesn't seem to have the energy or sense of mystery that such a story demands.

630281474X|5.0|I may well have seen this early entrant in the Hammer horror cycle 20-odd years ago, when living with a girlfriend who was much more a monster-movie aficionado than I was; but at the time, the plot was the thing, and remembering one Dracula movie from another wasn't something easy to do.<br /><br />I'll probably manage to keep it in the memory better now. This is a beautifully done, exquisitely photographed and altogether serious rendition of the hoary tale, with Christopher Lee properly menacing and for the first time (well, at least the first time in a popular film) showing the vampire as handsome, mysterious, and above all sexual. Max Schreck or Bela Lugosi he ain't. But while Lee's first appearance and the early scenes involving Jonathan Harker as his new librarian/victim to be are compelling enough, it's really with the introduction of the utterly magnetic Peter Cushing as Van Helsing that the film shifts into high gear. Cushing just takes over the film and is completely persuasive -- I'd follow this man on just about any mad quest, there is something so absolutely forceful and compelling in the character as he portrays him; I love the fact that time and again when his instructions are not followed, when he is not believed, he simply tries again, harder, and never becomes judgmental.<br /><br />We wouldn't necessarily blame him if he did, for Dracula menaces the entire household of Lucy Holmwood, Harker's fianc&eacute;, and Cushing tries futilely to keep them from any more horrors through his melding of the learned man of science and the student of the occult, though it should be said that the former is much more prominent in this film -- this is a \\"realistic\\" Dracula that plays by rules of nature, or at least Hammer would have us believe it so. This Dracula doesn't turn to mist or bats or display superhuman strength -- perhaps because the budget wouldn't allow it -- and in the end is defeated by the wits and the willpower of Van Helsing in one of the more powerful horror film finales I've ever seen.<br /><br />Director Terence Fisher, probably the greatest of the House of Hammer stable, keeps it moving but finds plenty of lyrical moments, and Jack Asher's brilliant and bright color photography also needs to be mentioned.  What good is a vampire film if the blood - and the skin - don't look right?  Here it's all amped-up almost - but not quite - to the point of garishness.  Hammer would go too far sometimes later in their cycle; here they get just about everything pitch-perfect.es I've ever seen.

B000XA5K48|3.0|I went into SHOOT 'EM UP knowing nothing about it, and thinking, \\"dang this is stupid\\", prepared for the worst almost from the get-go.  Or so it seemed at first, before I figured out that this silly piece of fluff was SUPPOSED to be a parody, a satire, a comedy -- at least, I hope it wasn't supposed to be anything even remotely serious or dramatic. Not that it necessarily succeeds even in its silliness, as there's nothing much new here or really interesting besides the ridiculous kinetic velocity of the whole thing. Nobody has any time to breathe here, let alone sleep, use the bathroom or make love -- all of which are attempted, and interrupted in quite violent ways, thus ensuring the parody aspects....I think. Clive Owen gets a fair amount of criticism from some quarters, and while I don't think it's entirely deserved, in this case I would have liked to see someone with a little more humor, a glint in his eye and a light smirk in his delivery -- Timothy Dalton 15 years ago comes to mind as a perfect choice. I can't argue with Monica Bellucci, who really exists only as eye candy; Paul Giamatti is getting tiresome in these obnoxious, weaselly villain roles but I suspect he's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing here, so kudos.<br /><br />What surprised me the most is that for a big-budget action film everything looked so dirty and dank, even the exteriors, and that so many of the action sequences are so cramped and hard to follow. Never mind the ridiculousness of the plot; again, if it's a parody, we just have to accept Owen somehow getting into this huge arms manufacturer's HQ/warehouse and booby-trapping his own guns to use against him and his men. What we shouldn't have to accept is that it's hard to tell what's going on in nearly every scene where guns are in play (which is most scenes) and that the colors and lighting are so washed-out and ugly. I really thought this was shot on DV until looking up the specs here, and was astonished that the ace cinematographer behind such Hong Kong classics as THE KILLER and THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR shot this; perhaps this is what was intended, but it sure didn't work for me.  Not sure why action films these days seem to all want to look simultaneously flashy and grungy; I guess somebody likes the aesthetic or it wouldn't be so common.<br /><br />And yet, the goofiness of it all did keep me entertained for the (thankfully) short running time. The car chase sequence alone was almost worth the price of admission, at the very least worth a laugh and a \\"oh they didn't do that did they? really?\\" moment. It's hard for me to find something I haven't seen in an action film, and this offered a couple of brief bits of that, so it certainly wasn't a total loss. Watched theatrically on first release and again recently.  Certainly worth a look for connoisseurs of action cinema at it's most over-the-top and demented.behind such Hong Kong classics as THE KILLER and THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR shot this; perhaps this is what was intended, but it sure didn't work for me.

0375842209|5.0|It is rare that a book finds its way into my life that I can recommend wholeheartedly, without reservations, to virtually anyone - regarless of their age, gender, cultural background, or personal interests. \\"The Book Thief\\" is such a book. I opened it without any expectations, but by the end, I was completely blown away with the power of the story, the characters, and the beautiful writing.    Without giving away too much of the plot, this is a story of a young German girl (she is nine years old when we first meet her), who goes to live with a foster family in a small suburb of Munich. As we follow her story, it becomes a lens through which we glimpse the pivotal years in German history, from the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party through the first few years of World War II. As is often the case in such turbulent times, they reveal both the best and the worst of human nature. So does this story, narrated by Death itself. It illuminates the themes of love and hatred, courage and fear, happiness and despair. Through the powerful story and living, breathing characters, we the reader are pulled into the force of the narrative that carries us on this emotional journey.    A word of caution that the narrative style of the book is quite unique (it being Death speaking, after all), and may challenge you at first. But if you stick with it, the rewards will be plentiful. This book will make you laugh, cry, break your heart and make it full at the same time. It will take your breath away.

B003A4IFGY|4.0|Being a big blues fan, I was pleased to hear that Petty's new album was going to be a blues album. Frankly I didn't think he's put out a really decent album since Wildflowers and hoped this would change my mind about TP in the 21st century.    While a lot of these songs have a blues influence, I would hardly call this a blues album. (If you really want to hear Tom play the blues, listen to \\"Little Red Rooster\\" from the Very Special Christmas Vol. 5) Though disappointed that it wasn't a true blues album, what I found was Tom Petty's best album since Wildflowers! The songs are loose, fun, and more enjoyable after a few listens. There aren't any real rockers here, but I believe those days are gone. When was the last time TP gave us an all-out rockin' tune? Overall, I'm happy with this purchase and haven't given up hope that Tom might still be able to rock out in a future release.

B002VECLVO|1.0|I have to agree with the naysayers on review of this movie:  it is sadly not at all what Mr. Isherwood's book conveyed. I read a discreetly located version of this book in 1966, I believe, and it was a stark read of a man's forelorn stream of conciousness regarding the loss of his lover, and how the world around him is now seemingly diffeent to him by this loss.  This movie is nothing like the book, save a few character's names and the setting in Los Angeles.  This movie is another man's (Mr. Tom Ford) copycat ideas from another man's (Mr. Isherwood) book.  I wondered if Mr. Isherwood were alive to tell, what his reaction might be to such a distasteful gleaming of one man's ideas turned into another man's ideas, with no regard to the orginal piece of work.  Mr. Ford has simply taken a storyline, and rewrote it --with the help of others-- to reflect his own life, as Mr. Ford does indeed state in the movie commentary.  When I first viewed the movie, I thought, 'Which book did Mr. Ford indeed read in order to base this drivel?'  After rewatching it the next evening with the commentary by Mr. Ford, I understood completely how this movie came to pass.  This is the egocentric audacity of Mr. Ford's vanity, upon which he took his own life instances, tossed out the bulk of Mr. Isherwood's story, and made a movie about Mr. Tom Ford: pretentious and lacking substance and story and feeling, to be quite frank.  The movie, on its own merit, is imagery \\"drivel.\\"

B003ICWTTM|4.0|I don't know why so many people are raving about the audio portion of this blu ray disc. It sounds like it was recorded in the middle of the Hyde Park crowd using a single microphone on a mediocre recorder. Maybe that's the goal of the engineer, but I was expecting something better than that. Aside from the sax and guitar solos, everything else about the instruments seems indistinct. The voices come across very well, though. What redeems the disc is Bruce himself - as always he gives the crowd its money's worth and more, putting on a tireless performance of a well-chosen set of songs. Despite the audio quality lacking (in my opinion), I was still smiling when watching this because the songs themselves are so good and so is the performance.

B002P8O29K|5.0|First, there isn't anything I could say to further eloborate on the quality of a Criterion Collection film reproduction. They are as good as it gets, period. Reference quality audio and video -- 'nuff said.<br /><br />Now then, as regards \\"Gimme Shelter\\" itself:<br />This film has taken on mythical status over the years. The subject is now a matter of legend and of ever-increasing historical significance. To look back upon it now after having lived it in the day - I turned 18 in '69 - evoked more emotions than I was prepared to deal with. I'd not seen the film again since it's theatrical release (and then for all the wrong reasons). I'm glad that I purchased my own copy (rather than watching a rental) so that each time I summon the courage I can return to look at it again.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you attended Altamont or not. If that is your generation you can look back at it and see the magic of a moment disappear and know exactly what was lost. The summer of love vanished in the flash of a blade. [My hands are shaking.]<br /><br />Don't take it out on the 'Stones. They were just silly kids caught up in the current.<br />I loved them then and to this day. You can see how scared Mick was having that crazy redneck stare at him murderously and yet trying his best to put on a show.<br /><br />On a lighter note, it was a hoot finding out that Scorcese and Coppola were on that camera crew. :-)<br /><br />Thanks.<br />Peace.

The series is well done and is captivating as it uses much original camera footage with informative narration that attempts to give the reasoning and the predicament of each side.  We should hope that we never are faced with such times again.    Package: Single-sided disks are held in polyethylene slim-line cases in a way that they should be.  Disks have adequate menus and contain the eerie music of the series in the introduction and closing.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially at this price!

Aside from some pacing problems (improved in the film version), it was an excellent book and I was looking forward to the sequel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is a big step down.  It starts with promise, but falls apart about halfway through.  The labyrinthine, fascinating tale of the first book is replaced with a welter of superficial, uninteresting characters and a glut of Action!  ACTION!  ACTION!!!  It reads like Ludlum on autopilot.  The ending is both illogical and unsatisfying, functioning solely as a cliffhanger for the next book in the series.<br /><br />Enjoy the first half of this book and plow through the rest to get to the superior \\"Hornet's Nest.\\"  Just don't expect another \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" along the way.

B00000G3AZ|1.0|This film adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel Emma is, in my opinion, the worst of the four. The filmmakers used a very exaggerated, hyperactive Hollywood style which really undermines Austen storytelling. It leaves the viewer every moment expecting something more 'exciting' to happen but of course because it's an Austen story, the excitement is not in large or epic events but in the small every day interactions between characters and in the things that happen that really can only affect themselves and not society at large. The result of this dichotomy was that it moved at a snail's pace when it tried to 'act' as if it were a racehorse, and I and my four friends who watched it, none of whom were familiar with Austen like I am, were all bored to the point of starting to FALL ASLEEP! We couldn't even finish it but turned it off a little over halfway through.<br /><br />My personal favorite adaptation is [[ASIN:0767020308 Emma (A&E, 1997)]], although the brand new one [[ASIN:B002XTBE6K Emma (2009)]] is excellent as well. The old BBC version [[ASIN:B000244F64 Emma (BBC, 1972)]] is forgettable and not worth watching since we have these other two excellent versions to pick from.

I am one of many that imagines Lisbeth Salander as best friend and helping me out here in NYC. I love Mikel too.

Great job Steve!

1423113497|5.0|I bought this book set for my 12 year old daughter on the recommendation of her teacher.  Being recommended by an \\"adult\\" of course she was reluctant to read them.  When I was laid up from foot surgery, I ran out of books to read, so out of boredom I grabbed this Percy Jackson series.    I loved it.  The combination Ancient Mythology and modern day New York is a novel concept, and extremely entertaining.  I read all three books one after the other.  Now my daughter can't wait to read them.  I would recommend this youth series for everyone, young and old alike.

B00127RAJY|5.0|So glad I took I chance on this one! I could feel it working immediately but i didn't feel like I was going to die.  During the Level 1 workout she starts you on butt kicks and they do just that- if you do it correctly.  I started my exercise adventure kinda winging it but after a few days felt like there were some times that felt like I didn't do anything.  I went out looking for something to add to those days.  I fell in love with this video.  Others are so complex that it is hard to keep up, but this is straight forward doing move we can all work our way up to and have seen around over time. YOu can even choose to do the workouts without her talking and that truely helps- after you know the routines.  I am so excited to finish my 30 days and can't wait to see my results!

I didn't realize it was an episalary when I bought and didn't know if I'd enjoy it, but found it wonderful.  You're reading about events after the fact - the letter writer is describing to the reader what happened, which was actually fun.

0307386171|4.0|Such a brilliant little book. On Chesil Beach captures the heart-felt feelings of Edward and Florence, newlyweds, as they honeymoon on the coast. I would not say this is a happy book, on the contrary. McEwan never misses an opportunity to point out to us how close this couple came to happiness. Instead, we are taken along on their sad path watching as happiness spirals out of their reach forever. How true to life this is for so many of us.
0545123275|5.0|Shiver<br />By Maggie Stiefvater<br />Published by Scholastic<br /><br />At age eleven, Grace was ripped from her backyard tire swing, dragged into the woods and mauled by a pack of wolves. Yet one wolf was different from the others. He glimpsed this beautiful young girl who did not scream or fight, and stared, fixed on her seemingly unafraid eyes, and her into his. His conscious would not allow this to be. His name was Sam; and he was her savior that day in the woods.<br /><br />Six years later: six winters of shared fascination across a seemingly immeasurable distance; six summers of an unfulfillable void left by his absence, Grace's \\"obsession\\" with the wolves is altered in an unimaginable way. When a classmate is attacked by the wolves and presumed dead, the town is thrown into panic, and local hunters comb the woods to rid them of the feared pack. That was the night Sam first appeared to Grace as Sam, and the night they both knew that they must do anything necessary never to part again.<br /><br />Stiefvater writes in lyrical prose, filling page after page with rhythmic intensity and a palpable angst. Fans of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series will no doubt devour this series with the same hunger. Shiver, the first in The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy does not disappoint, and I look forward to reading Linger when it is released July 13, 2010.
B00004Y6NM|5.0|Every once in a while I come across an album on which every track is one that I enjoy. This is one of them.<br />I used to listen to this when my children were young. Now I am a grandmother and I am buying this album for the third time because it is still a winner in my book even after all these years. Behind the Sun is music that I will share with others during gatherings of friends and family on the back deck of my home for countless years to come. Pick it up if you haven't heard it yet. I highly doubt that you will be disappointed.
6302439566|5.0|First off, If you did not live through the 80's you can't truly understand the concept behind this film.  The 80's was all about fitness and aerobics! Gyms were opening up everywhere and the health craze was taking over. It was the beginning of making your workout a social event !!  I was only 14 when I saw this movie (FOLLOWING FRIGHT NIGHT AT A DRIVE INN) and for some reason it struck a happy cord, even though at the time I may have not truly understood the meaning behind it all. Maybe the infectious 80's music did it? Maybe being only 14 and seeing all those HOT bodies shaking to the rhythm ? I had my Dad get me the soundtrack after.  It's not like it's a horrible plot, there are worse 80's movies out there.  This is John Travolta playing a reporter out to get a story on the GYM CRAZE and the relationships that develop behind it. What's so tacky about that? His acting is good.  Jamie Lee Curtis looks awesome and her acting is great too! These two are GREAT together !!All I know is that this movie has stayed with me as one of my favorite 80's feel good movies. When I think of PERFECT it brings up nothing but positive feelings. Ohh the 80's !!!
B00338QELU|1.0|This is a witless book and a waste of your money. How can an uneducated peasant end knowing how to write and teach others to speak correct Chinese. It boggles the mind at least did mine. Stupid premise and stupid book. BIG DON\\"T BUY.
B0036EH3WU|2.0|But for repeat viewings, this show does not hold up at all. By the end of the sixth season there are simply too many plot holes, unanswered questions, and loose ends that if you were to rewatch the entire series you would scratch your head multiple times and say \\"hey wait a minute...?\\"    But if this is your first time viewing this show, you will not have invested the time others have in the show, so you might not care if every detail is neatly tied up or not. If you've been watching the show from day one, then you will most likely not share this sentiment, but I don't need to explain that.    Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, the showrunners, clearly had no idea what direction they wanted their show to head in, so they made up everything as they went along. They may have had the final image in their head at the very start, but it takes no genius to see how they settled on it. Even their \\"proof\\" that they had it all figured out since the first season (the skeletons in the cave) contradicts itself when it's first presented to when it's resolved in the sixth season. Before the finale aired the writers tried to distance themselves from the dozens of unresolved mysteries and loose ends by stating that the show is about the characters. Lindelof himself has said that the island itself is the most important character on the show, so if the show really is about the characters, then the writers admittedly failed.     And besides, the show hasn't been about the human characters on the show since season 4, when character development was completely sacrificed for plot (and got so tangled the writers themselves couldn't even keep up with everything). Reasons for character actions used to be gradually orchestrated over the course of a season, and usually everything a character does lines up with what we have seen previously. By the season five finale, a character goes from opposing something devastating from happening to suddenly supporting it, with the excuse for her doing so as\\"she changed her mind.\\" In the same episode. Then they try to offer a more elaborate explaination, but it's so obvious the writers needed to twist the character in order to fit the plot, not the other way around. No, this show hasn't been about the people for years.    But if you're looking for an entertaining show to hold your attention, this is a great show. My bitterness only stems from the fact that I've watched this show since day one and have absolutely loved it, and I believed the writers when they said they knew what they were doing and everything had a purpose. It is undeniable that this show is entertaining, and oftentimes moving, but I can't give the show itself a good score because there are so many inconsistances. If you're looking for a show with meaning, substance, and overall sustainablilty, this is not your show.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|I'm an Allen fan. For me this was not a one of his great films, but was an<br />entertaining, diverting one, with two terrific performances by Javier<br />Bardem and Penelope Cruz, a very good one by Rebecca Hall, and a decent<br />one by Scarlett Johanssen.<br /><br />The key flaw -- Johanssen's character comes off as very shallow, so the complexity<br />of her relationships with Bardem and Cruz never seem more than<br />adolescent. I realize that's ultimately part of the point of the film,<br />but here it's way too obvious from minute one, and keeps the film from<br />ultimately feeling deeper and more complex. None-the-less, a romantic bittersweet<br />film I've enjoyed well enough to go back and re-watch.<br /><br />Interestingly, even more than most of Allen's films this seems to ignite very different reactions<br />from viewer to viewer, so I'd encourage you to check it out for yourself<br />if you have any interest in the elements.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Ok let me start by prefacing, I have NOT seen the animated series, nor do I really want too. I'm not that much into cartoons anymore, save for the Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, etc. Now onto the film. I don't see what peoples problem is, it's a really good movie and Charlze Theron looks hot as always. I'm a sucker for anything that gets her in tight form-fitting leather. I thought it was a good movie that people should rate based on it's own and not base it on the series, people do that too much.

030745455X|1.0|Stieg Larsson really wants you, dear reader, to know how cool his characters are.  They all shop at IKEA, they all use Apple computers, they drink lots of coffee from fancy espresso machines, they ride Harley Davidson motorcycles.  Murder weapons?  Nothing will do but a Colt .45 revolver.  How is this character going to pay for her name-brand frozen pizza?  A Visa card.  Everything in this book is brand-name.  That's one of the reasons this book is so tedious to read.  Larsson bludgeons your senses with all these brands and their associated minutiae, including how much they cost.  Why should we care?<br /><br />But for all their coolness, Larsson's characters are hypocritical and amoral and obnoxious.  Lisbeth, the female protagonist, guards her privacy jealously, but she has no qualms with spying electronically on whomever she chooses, including her \\"friends\\".  She's oddly vindictive towards her erstwhile journalist and crime-solving partner, Mikael Blomqvist, when SHE's the one who chose to sleep with him.  What was she expecting?  She's committed wire fraud, but she's supposedly the hero.  I don't root for bitchy \\"heroines\\".<br /><br />Blomqvist fares no better.  He's a douche who doesn't bat an eye at sleeping with his editor...his editor who happens to be married.  Nope.  I guess her husband is just supposed to deal with the idea of being cuckolded on a regular basis.  Yes, this happens all the time all over the world.  That doesn't make it any less douche-y.  Anyway, I'll get off my prudish high horse and simply recommend that you don't bother with this book or its predecessor (which I also read and didn't like...\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".)

You're missing alot of the back story! I'm glad you have an open mind.  Besides that of the three movies, Eclipse is teh one that can stand by itself the most without reading the books. but the books are a definite necessity. The movie was great , the action scenes were fantastic, but we girls like our action with the mush attached thank you very much.  Now we have such a loooonnnngggggg wait for Breaking Dawn....pooh. :>(   THAT really needs an upgrade to an R rating to do it justice.

B002436WFI|5.0|It may not be possible to do a Terry Pratchett novel full justice on screen, but this movie is quite a bit of fun. At first I thought there might be a problem with the casting (I thought Rincewind would be younger, Samwise Gamgee as Two Flower?). I soon overcame my misgivings and enjoyed the film for what it was, not what it wasn't. All in all perhaps a decimal behind The Hogfather, but still highly recommended - if - you like Pratchett already. If you don't know then read the book first (actually 'books'. The movie combines the Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic.)

1843118076|5.0|AN INVALUABLE WORK OF REFERENCE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />For the legal practitioner, this book is a unique and invaluably time saving survey of the law affecting the shipmaster across a range of jurisdictions worldwide, all logically set out in one convenient volume.<br /><br />Not only is this a unique source of reference for lawyers and the courts, as well as ship masters themselves, the insights it provides constitute an invaluable aid to decision making for ship managers and operators, not to mention risk managers.<br /><br />But the book is aimed at a still wider readership, from port authorities, consuls and coastguards to brokers, bankers and booking clerks. At last, here is a volume that offers in-depth and quite astounding insights into the person and pivotal role of the shipmaster.  Responsible for his ship 24 hours a day the Shipmaster holds the responsibility for transporting its cargo across oceans.  The book starts by attempting to establish a commonly recognized definition of `shipmaster', described in general terms as 'a qualified seafarer in charge of a ship'.  In English usage, the term `Captain' is the title which refers to most masters. Mere definitions, however, cannot begin to describe adequately the complexities of the shipmaster's role.<br /><br />In the newly emerging world of global business the modern shipmaster must deal with, assimilate, act upon and make judgments upon vast loads of information pertaining to commercial and maritime practices; from cargo, engineering and salvage, to medical and employment issues, as well as weather and conditions in ports.  This book will assist the shipmaster -- and those with whom he works - to understand his place in law in whatever jurisdiction he finds himself anywhere in the world.<br /><br />Just one look at the table of contents of this remarkable volume reveals its impressive scope. Part III, for example, deals with `The principal domestic laws governing the Shipmaster in the States of the United Nations and the International Maritime Organization'  These number some 300 nations at least, from Afghanistan to Vanuatu and Zimbabwe - all covered in this book, which excels in the  depth and breadth of knowledge of its subject matter.<br /><br />For example, check out the note on the Centennial of the Titanic which mentions that the swift reaction to the disaster of 1912 was the convention SOLAS which survives as 'one of the pillars of the law of the shipmaster'- note to editor: SOLAS, contrary to what the footnote says, is not listed in the Table of Acronyms -- a minor glitch in this otherwise exemplary book!<br /><br />In addition to this and other fascinating historical insights and a survey of the international law affecting the shipmaster, the book contains the certification, nationality and taxation requirements for the master in 179 jurisdictions.  It compares the law of agency for shipmasters and crews across jurisdictions and examines the duties of shipmaster, encompassing liabilities and penalties in all IMO member states.<br /><br />The book's publication date is September 2009.  No doubt it will be updated as the years pass.  We believe it is destined to become a classic work in maritime and shipping law.Shipmaster in the States of the United Nations and the International Maritime Organization'   These number some 300 nations at least, from Afghanistan to Vanuatu and Zimbabwe - all covered in this book, which excels in the  depth and breadth of knowledge of its subject matter.

0891419063|5.0|Over the years I've collected maybe 40 books relating to the war in the Pacific.  I don't know how or why I overlooked this one, maybe the title, but I would rate it one of the top three in terms of describing the dirty side of combat.  The only two books that I think come close are Tenozan and Munda Trail.  To be honest I, like so many others, completely overlooked the battle for Peleliu thinking it just one of those side skirmishes.  Of course there's lots of print concerning the really big battles like Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa but the battle for Peleliu has to rate up there with the worst of them.<br />So many of the books tend to be tactical or historical in nature with few details of what it's really like to grovel through the mud in close combat and the horror of the battlefield right down to the maggots. Sledge wasn't a reporter or journalist or even very skilled at writing but he took good notes and constructed from them this eye-opening account of battlefield reality.
1843118246|5.0|ENTER THE ROTTERDAM RULES<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The activity of transporting goods by both land and sea for purposes of trade has been with us probably since the Stone Age.  But what changes have been wrought since then, obviously, in marine technology (oar to sail, to steam, and so forth), extended trade routes and developments in methods of navigation and communications worldwide.  A gradual evolution has also taken place in the regulatory environment governing shipping.  Part of this evolution has been the recent emergence of \\"The Rotterdam Rules\\".<br /><br />To give them their full title, The Rotterdam Rules, comprise `the Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea - The Rules cater for transport which includes both land and sea. Opened for signature in September 2009, The Rotterdam Rules represent what has been called `the most comprehensive overhaul of the law of carriage of goods by sea in more than fifty years' -- an overhaul, we would add, that is probably a bit overdue, for at least two reasons, as the authors point out.<br /><br />The first is the gigantic increase in container traffic - and secondly, the now almost universal use of `electronic means of communication', particularly in the issue and transfer of bills of lading. Powers for accommodating electronic transport documents were actually provided by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, but these powers remain unused.  It's in response to such realities that The Rotterdam Rules have been developed<br /><br />As pointed out by the authors of this thorough and scholarly book, the Rotterdam Rules have not yet been fully adopted by the UK government (Labour, prior to May 2010,) or even internationally.  They imply, however, The Rotterdam Rules will eventually supplant, or at least supplement the Hague-Visby Rules which have served shipping perfectly well for over 30 years, but which are now `beginning to show their age.'<br /><br />This book is indeed `a practical annotation' of  The Rotterdam Rules, providing a thorough and minutely detailed commentary on their highly complex 96 articles and indicating throughout the various means by which The Rotterdam Rules compare with, or depart from the Hague-Visby Rules, which still remain the instrument covering most bills of lading.<br /><br />How interesting, then, that the term `bill of lading' does not appear in the definition of `contract of carriage' in the Rotterdam Rules.  Vanished, obliterated, rendered extinct, the old familiar `bill of lading' has been replaced `to accommodate the wider concept of a \\"transport document\\" and/or \\"electronic transport record\\".'  The Rotterdam Rules, say the authors have `moved on from the smaller world of the Hague-Visby Rules' in response, no doubt, to the necessities of global business and modern communications.<br /><br />If you're a maritime lawyer, this formidable work of reference is essential reading, as it should be for anyone affected -- or potentially affected -- by the new Rules, including solicitors, barristers, claims handlers and in-house legal advisers.  Part of the Maritime and Transport Library, it contains copious Tables of Cases, International Conventions, Statutes, Legislation and European Legislation.<br /><br />Certainly it contains the authoritative content you need to expand your understanding of the Rotterdam Rules and advise your clients accordingly.their age.'

B002RSDW80|4.0|Nora Ephron, the American author, blogger and screenwriter of [[ASIN:B0000AM6IS Silkwood]], [[ASIN:B00003CXDC When Harry Met Sally]] and [[ASIN:B0000AOV4I Sleepless in Seattle (10th Anniversary Edition)]], fashioned this film on the real-life experience of Julie Powell, who elected to cook all the recipies in the French cookbook of Juliet Child, the famous TV chef from PBS, and went on to her own sort of fame in the new century because of it.<br /><br />The film intersperses cutouts from the lives of each of the two -- the up and coming Child, who took cooking classes in France during the 1950s and became a better chef than the men in her class -- and Powell, a nobody in a New York insurance telephone center with aspirations of fame and glory as a chef. The interplay of scenes from each woman's life, including their respective marriages, personal lives and troubles, keeps the film humane and interesting. It allows you to involve yourself with the totality of each woman rather than watching a glossy soap opera of their interchange.<br /><br />The cast is a good one. Meryl Streep, veteran of Silkwood and scores of other big name films, plays the famous Child in every scene. She did remind me of the woman I watched on PBS's The French Chef in the 1970s with all her personality and frolicsome behaviors. Amy Adams is sympathetic as Powell, the wannabe chef that finally arrives after publishing the outcome of her cooking on her blog. In this regard, the film is a traversal of routes to fame in the respective centuries -- with Child reaching hers through television and literature (a cookbook) and Powell staking her claim to fame through the new century medium, the blog.<br /><br />The film is engaging although I can't say it's among the most memorable movies I've seen in recent months. It's surely a good one and worth your rental or purchase dollars, especially if you have a bored girlfriend of wife looking for something different, breezy and entertaining tonight on the small screen. For this is surely more a chick flick than a guy's film although it's good enough to transcend the differences.surely more a chick flick than a guy's film although it's good enough to transcend the differences.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|Is the irony that Mr. Moore 'capitalized' on the shortcomings of capitalism to make a for-profit movie lost on anyone?     Featuring the story about PA Child Care as an accurate representation of capitalism is like featuring Michael Vick as an accurate representation of the NFL. It's insulting to people who go about their business in an honest manner.    Mr. Moore focuses solely on the despicable, bottom feeders of our capitalistic system. He bleaches out the good, and fails to include compelling, competing views of our capitalistic system by quoting the likes of the owner of Condo Vultures, an obvious scumbag.     I run a small business, and this is what I tell my liberal, statist friends who worship at Mr. Moore's altar. Were I to try to trick my customers, cut corners, hide profits, and do any sort of shenanigan that Mr. Moore espouses as being universally practiced, I'd be out of business in less than a year. Intangibles like reputation count for a lot, and people do have the choice not to use my services. In fact, I've been able to start a business and provide for myself and my family precisely because we have free market capitalism. Were we living in Cuba, I doubt I'd be allowed, just as Mr. Moore's movie-making career would not have led to obesity and awards were he making films critical of Castro there.    This is not to say there weren't some eye-opening segments in the movie. The practice of major companies cashing in on \\"Dead Peasants\\" was new to me and is loathsome. However, so is the government's use of Fannie/Freddie to indirectly entice people to buy homes they couldn't afford. Mr. Moore is silent on anything that doesn't fit his narrow world view.     In sum, Mr. Moore is unfortunately part of the contemporary \\"American problem,\\" (as I like to call it): our media is dominated by the far left and the far right, to the exclusion of the middle. Mr. Moore's failure to even acknowledge that there is a middle ground is all the more ironic given his apparent love of the 'middle' class. With all its faults and flaws, free market capitalism in a democratic society is good, and those of you reading this on a fancy pc drinking Starbucks coffee ought to agree.

B001C3KCSY|1.0|I'm not a former fan of KOL and probably never will be based on this album. So I can't rant from the same angle of so many who say this is a let down from the past. So I can't disagree with them and totally understand as that has been the M.O. of many bands lately who produced great music from 2001-2007 and followed it up with absolute trash. I try to follow new, but obscure, indie and alternative music as much as I can and 2008-2010 has been bleak at best. If this is what is standard or popular, we've taken yet another turn toward a denegration of a music genre (as with country, rap, grunge, etc.).<br /><br />For the past year I've had a new job where I drive a truck for about 5-6 hours a day that has no CD player. I can't wear headphones so I'm forced to listen to the radio. I use it as a way to pick up on new music. In that year I've constantly heard 4 tracks from this CD. After a year, Sex on Fire is finally starting to sound tolerable. The other 3 songs only sound worse with time. I find that highly unusual. Typically, new music you don't like at first grows on you at least a little. Use Somebody is the worst. I wanna gouge out my eardrums everytime I hear that song.<br /><br />To me the most tolerable song is Crawl and it's still mediocre at best. The intro has a very annoying sound. However, once that's over the singer's voice is more palatable than in other songs and the music just seems more substantive. Maybe it's the darker overtone, but it definitely took only one or two listens for me to tolerate it.<br /><br />I like how a lot of 1 star reviews compare this to Nickelback. What an atrocious band that never should get airplay...ever. Yet they do. Uhg! This album is similar. We shouldn't have to hear that voice and the bland, bland music so many times on the radio. It's always a sign to me that we're being force-fed what \\"they\\" want us to like. Maybe it's because I'm not a former fan, but I don't get the gripes about how KOL have become pandering corporate-rock sellouts, making bubblegum music for hit radio. I don't think it's even good enough for that. Like a couple people have written, how can anyone honestly think this is good music? To me, KOL sounds like the worst of Bruce Springsteen mixed with the worst of Journey; two very overrated bands. While Journey was a good band who made some great songs, they never had a great album and every album always had 1 or 2 lousy, trite ballads that got way too much radio play. Ditto for this KOL album.<br /><br />Maybe it's just not for me. To each his own. Taste is a subjective matter anyway, but this album makes me hesitant to listen to the old stuff that former fans say is actually good.bubblegum music for hit radio.

B003O3QT96|5.0|I love this CD it has everything one could want from an artist. The beginning is very fun and high energy, then it strips down to the more organic style of music that xtina really shines in. That's usually when shes at her best but the new pop music on this CD is great. Probably the best dance songs that she has ever released but that's the thing I don't understand.... Why is there so much negativity going on for this album and personal attacks on Xtina? Shes an amazing artist and I can honestly say I can listen to this Cd from start to finish without having to skip any songs, in fact, that's probably the best way to listen to them b.c. the track list is arranged perfectly in my opinion. I have listened to this CD non-stop since it came out. Its awesome, I Definitely Recommend!!!<br /><br />My favorites are: \\"Bionic,\\" \\"Prima donna,\\" \\"Desnudate,\\" \\"Elastic Love,\\" \\"You Lost Me,\\" \\"Lift Me Up,\\" \\"All I Need,\\" \\"I Am,\\" \\"I Hate Boys,\\".......Basically the whole CD. some songs may take a few listens to since they are a little different than what most are use to.
0307269752|5.0|I have not finished reading the book, but so far it has kept me very excited and interested.  So far I have not been disappointed in the author or his story line.
B00308YN2U|4.0|I'm not sure if this is true of all the special editions of this product, but the one I received was from Canada.  This means that the only subtitles available are French.  You can not see subtitles in English.  This can be a niggling objection to the product for some, but if the characters don't enunciate well you are sometimes left in a quandary about what is happening or what was said.  The special features were very good and quite interesting.  Some were very humorous.  It was a chance to see a little about the actors who portray the book characters.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|Joanna Newsom sampled over a ?uestlove beat? What more could a guy want? I was impressed from track one, but as soon as \\"Right On\\" hit my ears, I was in love. Talk about earning some major indie cred (assuming people still do that sort of thing). If that's not enough, Jim James' hauntingly pleas \\"Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you,\\"  in \\"Dear God 2.0,\\" a Monsters of Folk-sampling modern masterpiece.<br /><br />Shall I suggest you marvel at the ability to auto-tune a baby crying and make it one hell of a sick beat? I bet Lil' Wayne wishes he woulda got his resin-soaked hands on that beat. \\"Walk Alone,\\" a lonesome tale, is absurdly catchy, as reverb-soaked vocals repeat \\"I walk alone, I walk alone, I walk alone, you know I'm walkin' alone.\\"<br /><br />The title-track is an instant classic; it even received a 'top songs of 2009' acknowledgement, way before the rest of the album was even released. It has an ageless feel to it, singing of strife, of struggle, of racism, crime, and city-life. Maybe a white boy like me can't relate, but I can appreciate the art of it all; most people weren't \\"Born by the river in a little tent\\" but they sure can appreciate Sam Cooke's \\"A Change is Gonna Come.\\"<br /><br />Though How I Got Over may not sell like a Young Money star might, it doesn't mean it isn't as good, if not better. Take Drake's latest efforts: it's selling like crazy but can't match the greatness of his breakthrough hit \\"The Best I Ever Had\\". Unlike Drake, the Roots continue to top themselves, commercially successful or not.<br /><br />The \\"live\\" aspects of the album are admirable; real instruments and beats instead of touchpad and computer generated musings. The pop-sensibility of each chorus is solid and nearly unmatched by modern day rap, save the Kanye or Jay-Z track. This album may, in fact, be the best thing to come out all year, and that's the first time I've ever felt that way about a hip-hop album.
B002VECLVO|5.0|\\"A Single Man\\" is so damn cool looking you could watch it with the sound off and still be impressed. It's use of color and sets are stunning. I was afraid it would be too \\"fashion magazine\\" from what I had read about Ford's film but I have to say while it is all pretty pristine looking it never once takes away from the emotional heft of the film or the superb acting of the four main cast members.     Firth, Moore, Goode, and Hoult all leave impressions on you in this film that will follow you around for days. Colin Firth plays George, a brokenhearted middle aged professor who still finds joy and warmth all around him. He clings to every flicker of happiness like a moth to a flame, and the film literally lights up every time George finds something to smile about. The problem is every time George finds something to be happy about it reminds him of Jim (Matthew Goode) who was a handsome young sailor who fell for the professor. Jim was prefect, at least as far as we see from George's point of view and with him gone what is the point of it all really?     The Cuban Missile crisis rages in the background of this film but George has more important things to worry about. Namely, what he is still doing alive when his heart was ripped from him when Jim left. Julianne Moore plays Charley, a character that hints to George's life before he met Jim. Charley is a bitter Brit herself, with an ex-husband and a still simmering crush for George that dates back to London. The two of them have a complex and loving relationship, but does Charley Really understand what George feels inside? Does Kenny (Nicholas Hoult in a breakout performance) a rebellious gay college student who looks to The Professor for answers about his own mental issues and maybe more. Kenny lights up the film with youthful joy and enthusiasm that makes you, and George, wonder if life just might be worth living.     It's hard to lock down a real plot to \\"A Single Man\\" in my opinion. If you were to explain it to a friend you could do so in 1 sentence and it would sound truly boring. This film is anything but boring and I recommend seeing it to experience what I mean!
0307269752|1.0|I just finished listening to half of the audio book.  The story is slow paced but is interesting. I believe that this book would have me hooked on to the entire series of books except for the fact that there is a lot of sexual scenes.  One of the main characters, Mikael Blomkvist, has a ongoing long term sexual relationship with Erika Berger who is married to another man.  However, the reader is reassured that everything is Ok because the husband of Erika doesn't mind.  This relationship destroyed Blomkvist's marriage.  Later on he meets another friend/occasional  lover.  The other main character Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, is raped by her guardian, who is appointed by the state, I can not say how graphic the rape scene is because I felt compelled to fast forward through it.<br /> Because the book keeps involving characters who have casual sex and graphically describes rape; I have been forced to stop listening to this book and will avoid any other books by this author.  I believe that this book would be better forgotten in the sands of time that to be read.
0307346617|5.0|World War Z has literally something for everyone. Horror stories. Personal family stories. Religious and political stories. War stories. Animal stories. What a great idea for a book, and this bloody and well thought out tale is in good hands with the talented Max Brooks at the helm. An expert on all things Zombie, this is the book Max was born to write it seems. Each story comes creeping up on you like one of the poor undead army in this post apocalyptic thriller. What is left of humanity has fought and won (?) a war against the undead and all they are left with are questions, battle scars, and war stories about survival and salvation that will keep the pages turning well into the night. My only qualm with \\"Z\\" was the choppiness of the storytelling. Stories end abruptly at times when you wish they would continue. Many of the short \\"interviews\\" in this book could make entire books in my opinion. You jump from Canada to Texas to Porto Rico and back in the space of 35 pages and it can be kind of disorienting. Without giving anything away, things are alluded to by characters that you never quite get the gist of. Someone will mention something major that helped win the war but you will never get a good explanation of how or what it was. Brooks has immersed himself in this gritty world to the point you get the feeling HE alone knows all the details of how the war was won. At the end of the day that's fine. This is a good, dare I say great work of horror fiction I'd recommend to anyone. The zombies attacking submarines chapter alone more than made this worth the price!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Wow!  When I bought this on the date of its release, I had no idea what to expect.  Being a Zeppelin fan, though, I had to get my hands on it and when I popped it into my CD player I was amazed!  The vast variety of styles on this album is simply brilliant; from tribal sounding rhythms to a beautiful acoustic guitar track (\\"All the Kings Horses\\"), this album will make you eager to hear the next track.  I cannot find a song on this album that I don't enjoy listening to, and I find myself pushing the repeat button all too often.  Robert Plant's voice is still as golden and emotional as it was back in the Led Zeppelin era, and his lyrics are fantastic and quite uplifting.  This album deserves a 10/10 certainly, and is easily one of my favorites of all time due to its variety and great quality.  Many instruments on this CD are not standard ones that you will find on your average recordings, and that is what makes \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" so unique.  I for one am so happy that Plant is continuing to explore and innovate within the world of music.    I highly recommend this album to anyone who wishes to hear unique, catchy, beautiful melodies created by some extremely talented musicians.    I hope there is another album in the future from The Strange Sensation

B001IFZL50|5.0|This series is a must have. The blu-ray brings the picture home perfectly. You'll notice the only bad reviews are from those who have a political problem with the movie and don't want to believe any part of it is true. If your willing to open your eyes and ears, you'll learn a lot about how fighting a war really gets done.
B003C5FMEE|4.0|It didn't take a genius to peg Troy \\"Trombone Shorty\\" Andrews as a national success waiting to happen. He's young, good-looking and a born entertainer, he was also making credible jazz records when he was barely out of puberty. His roots are in the Treme Brass Band circuit--which, if the HBO series Treme does its bit, will soon be in the national consciousness. But Andrews has already played to arenas, touring in Lenny Kravitz's band and playing in the U2/Green Day number at the 2006 Saints home opener. All someone had to do was make a capital-C crossover album--maybe with a brass-hop version of \\"St. James Infirmary\\" on it--and wait for the money to roll in.<br /><br />Backatown is definitely not that album, nor is it necessarily the one you'd expect from his live shows, which ride heavily on extended party jams. It's a crossover set, but a creative one that doesn't play to the tourists alone. Galactic's Ben Ellman produces, and it's up the same general alley as Galactic's Ya-Ka-May, which placed loops, samples and bounce beats within the New Orleans R&B tradition. Backatown's title track is clearly a studio creation with its looped drums, echoed guitar and synths, and a horn line that sounds flown in from a different recording, capped by a brief but fiery trombone solo. It sounds lively and catchy instead of overloaded, like one of those lucky accidents when two houses leave their windows open and the results mesh.<br /><br />The cut-and-paste approach also works for the disc's one familiar tune, Allen Toussaint's \\"On Your Way Down.\\" There wasn't much need for another faithful version of the song (Elvis Costello and Little Feat both nailed it in different decades) and this one (with Toussaint's own piano at the heart of the mix) updates the groove and reworks the melody without losing the message, throwing some nifty \\"Shaft\\"- style flute into the bargain. Kravitz's influence is clear on the other vocal tracks: \\"Something Beautiful\\" is the kind of Stevie Wonder/EWF homage that made Kravitz's name, but sounds more like a hit than anything on his last two albums.<br /><br />If there's a problem here, it's that Andrews and the band never stretch out. The longest of the 14 tracks on Backatown is 3:46--unheard-of brevity for nearly any modern album, much less a funk-based one. The power-chord driven \\"Suburbia\\" demands more than the three minutes it gets; \\"928 Horn Jam\\" has all the makings of a raucous old-school finale, but cuts off after 40 seconds. Maybe this is another nod to the Galactic audience, which figures that live tapes are for trading and that studio albums are the place to break ground.--OffBeat Magazine, May 2010 issueKravitz's name, but sounds more like a hit than anything on his last two albums.

B003L1ZXCU|2.0|\\"Daemon\\" is a unique book.  Unfortunately, it's not a particularly good book.  I picked it up after hearing several glowing recommendations on Leo Laporte's \\"This Week in Technology\\".  Well, Leo's guests may be technology gurus, but clearly they aren't literary critics.    Daniel Suarez knows his technology, and goes to great detail to prove it to the reader - over and over and over again.  Unfortunately, his ceaseless detailed exposition of computer gaming, networking, and security gets in the way of the story.  Suarez tries to use his tech background to justify the Daemon as a plausible possibility, when in fact it is nothing of the sort.  Despite what the characters say, no logic tree, regardless of its complexity, could do what the Daemon does.  The Daemon has to be true AI; it is omniscient and omnipotent, and once that is established (very early in the story), it could just as easily be based on magic fairy dust and incantations.  Suarez's attempts to explain the Daemon's abilities using modern technology don't wash, and as the novel progresses those abilities become even more implausible.    Suarez could take a few lessons from a writer like Vernor Vinge.  Dr. Vinge is every bit as capable as Suarez in providing technological detail to a story, but unlike Suarez he is a good enough writer to know when to draw the line.  Read \\"True Names\\" by Vinge, look at the year that Vinge wrote it, and you'll realize that Daniel Suarez still has a lot to learn as a writer.    Suarez clearly tried to write a technothriller, but it's really a sci-fi novel.  As science fiction goes, however, it is completely derivative.  Anyone who has read D.F. Jones, Vinge, Gibson, Stephenson, Doctorow, etc., has seen all of this before.  \\"Daemon\\" is a pastiche of plot elements from all of those authors, mixed with a little gratuitous sex and plenty of bloody action scenes reminiscent of the Matrix and Terminator franchises.  You almost have a vision of Suarez saying, \\"This will make a great screenplay!\\" as he wrote it.  Sorry, Daniel, but \\"Eagle Eye\\" and \\"I, Robot\\" have already covered the same ground (omnipotent A.I. decides to control and reshape society), and did it better.  I doubt Hollywood is going to bite on \\"Daemon\\" anytime soon.    The characters in \\"Daemon\\" are mostly meat puppets, either doing the Daemon's bidding with barely an ounce of free will or individuality, or swept along by the Daemon's manipulations.  You do what the Daemon tells you to do, or you die (and sometimes you die anyway).  Several characters rationalize cold-blooded murder with barely a twinge of conscience.  The irony is that while Suarez is clearly arguing a thesis that modern corporations and capitalism are bad because they reduce the common man to cogs in the machinery of society, the Daemon is every bit as ruthless with its own minions.  Ah, but the Daemon will manage us for our own good.  Riiight.    From what I've read, \\"Freedom (TM)\\" is oriented even more strongly towards Suarez's vision of future America as some sort of anarcho-agrarian utopia, with all the evil financial and industrial oligarchs put to death.  If \\"Daemon\\" and \\"Freedom (TM)\\" ever do make it to the silver screen, I can guarantee you that those particular plot points won't survive the first script rewrite.  As for me, I'll do what Suarez's characters can't, and exercise a little free will by passing on the sequel.
B002I6251G|3.0|No, unfortunately, none of todays bands can recreate the synth days of 80's masters and make the songs memorable, catchy or epic.    This album isn't bad, it's boring and repetitive. Many songs have 1-2 min of interesting material but then they paste it like 5 times to make the song(s) last 6-7 minutes.    And while the singer has a powerful and distinctive vocals (like Ian Curtis), that's often the problem - too many times he just \\"talks\\". That makes some songs uninteresting because music is often more melodic and when he starts \\"talking\\" it's boring.    The back room is much better album than this one. But like I said - at least they tried to make this different. I'm afraid they are worn and uninspired.

I started watching and got hooked. I was 21 when Woodstock happened. I wasn't there, but I was there, if you know what I mean.  When the helicopter lands in the beginning, it really sent chills up my spine. You kind of know what's about to happen. There were some fun times, and it brought it all back. If you were part of that generation, you might enjoy this. I thought it was a good representation of that period. And the story of Elliot and his family is interesting. That's my opinion.

The movie itself is fascinating and an interesting next step in Alice's saga. It's a fun ride with the characters but may be a bit intense for younger kids.
630587493X|5.0|In \\"Bicentennial Man\\"based a novel written by Isaac Asimov. We see a simple machine at the beginning who starts his life as a simple machine much as the character Data in Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek: The Next Generation. They are both simply activated. They start as blank slates for which to begin the world. Just as a human is born into the world with nothing but basic functions; and we grow to accomplish such magnificent things. This movie seeks to bring people into the view that  Asimov, as well ad Roddenberry convey in the use of an \\"android\\" to carry a lot of story line. That for all man is we seek to be more perfect and live longer. we should instead focus on our humanity. that is truly the precocious part of us. Truly a film for all people to see.

0441009425|3.0|In Revelation Space, you'll be exposed to futuristic cyborg \\"ultra-humans,\\"  ageless mysteries, other intelligent races, self-repairing spaceships, new weapons systems, planetary politics... really, there is so much that is different here that it seems overwhelming to the reader.  You really have to keep track of a lot.<br /><br />And although the plot is slow to unfold, and jumps around in time and space, author Alastair Reynolds does get it done.  The mystery is huge, and will affect all life in the galaxy.  A clone of a famous scientist (who doesn't know he is a clone) is pursued to either be killed or to save the captain of a plague-infested ship.  Sounds lame, I know.  But the story is much, much more complicated than that.<br /><br />There are additional books that spring from Revelation Space.  I'm not sure that I'm going to look for them, although I am interested in reading some of Reynolds' other sci-fi books.  I guess the jury is still out.

0596009208|1.0|First, a general comment on programming books:  Stop giving people useless code examples.  People learn how to program by actually programming.  When will someone make a book that gives you useful, practical, hands on exercises instead of useless code snippets?<br /><br />Specific to this book is the fact that they're worse about this useless code than anyone else I've ever seen.  They gloss through scores of different topics quickly, with little detail or practical use.  You will not learn Java from this book.
B000002KOO|4.0|I see Then Play On as a transitional album for Fleetwood Mac. The temporary virtual departure of Jeremy Spencer is apparent in the absence of his slide guitar stylings and the Elmore James inspired blues songs. Spencer's leaving left more room for the varied talents of Danny Kirwan. Thus, although there are blues elements in this album (Show-Biz Blues) it is more diverse, containing several instrumentals (not to everyone's taste - a little too easy listening for some, My Dream/Underway, for example,), some softer material that presages the later mega popular Mac and even prog rock (the memorable Oh Well). With its somewhat shotgun stylistic approach Then Play On ran the risk of sounding disjointed, lacking in cohesion. However, rather like the Beatles' White Album, the diversity of its parts makes the whole more appealing to me. Unfortunately, this was to be Peter Green's last appearance on record as part of the band. Although they went on to much bigger things in terms of popularity there are many who consider Then Play On to be Fleetwood Mac's high water mark.

It is full of techniques to get you to pick up your instrument that has been sitting in the corner, collecting dust.       I honestly believe that Kenny knows more about teaching music than anyone on the planet. I have read it twice and I am getting ready to read it again.        Kenny also has two dvds out, where he talks to college musicians and answers their questions. These dvds should be pur-  chased, as well.
0060853972|5.0|Neil Gaiman ([[ASIN:0060558121 American Gods: A Novel]], [[ASIN:B001S33D1G Coraline [Mass Market Paperback]]]) and Terry Pratchett ([[ASIN:0060890339 Wintersmith, [[ASIN:0060012382 The Wee Free Men (Discworld)]](Discworld)]]) are witty, clever and funny.  A collaboration of the two, therefore is a \\"can't miss.\\"  In _Good Omens_, the world is soon coming to an end - the Anti-Christ is born, the Four Horsemen are convening and the End Times are upon us.  But what if an angel (Aziraphale) and a demon (Crawley) really *liked* things the way they were and would rather not end all the fun things (like answering machines, feeding ducks and vintage Bentleys)?  What if the minons of Good and Evil really had more in common with each other than one might think?  What if the Anti-Christ (who is a human being, afterall), had second thoughts?  This is the premise Gaiman and Pratchett center their book on.<br /><br />The idea works, and works in the silly, funny and ironic way that is the hallmark style of these two authors.  There are running jokes about human nature and free-will, tongue-in-cheek parodies of bad Cold War films, and a number of uncomfortable truths about human nature.  In a nut-shell, it is a highly entertaining read.  Some reviewers have agrued that the collaboration between Gaiman and Pratchett is not as brilliant as either author alone.  I disagree.  The artistic synthesis between the two is entirely different from each author's individual work; more than once I tried to identify which author wrote which bit, but my attempts to tease out the particular style of one or the other was ultimately futile.  The collaboration was seamless.<br /><br />_Good Omens_ is simply a fun read, a recommendation I don't get to make very often.
B003A03RRU|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has always appealed to me. I enjoy his penetrating logic and allergy to boredom. Although I loved these stories as a kid, I never fully appreciated the marvel of Arthur Conan Doyle's storytelling and prose style. The latest Sherlock Holmes movie, with Robert Downey Junior playing the master sleuth, inspired me to re-discover these stories and novels. I especially loved \\"Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" a timeless \\"creepy\\" tale that combines a supernatural legend with unexplained deaths and a hidden identity. Holmes and Watson leave the comforts of their cozy flat at 221B Baker Street to explore the stark moors. The characters they meet are all fully developed and yet, hide critical evidence from view. The scary chase with a hound across the foggy moor is still a fearful experience, even though I have read the scene many times. It's hard to believe these stories were written a hundred years ago. Although set in a Victorian age of hansom cabs, mud-spattered boots and afternoon tea, the dialogue and the observations about human nature are still fresh and seem like they were written today.
0525423842|4.0|This book definitely introduces Theo and John Grisham to kids and breaks down some legal terms as well. Am I missing that the ending is \\"understood?\\" Do we really need to go through the steps of the obvious? I agree it is a bit \\"tame\\" and there was room for a bit more suspense between Theo and Cheepe, but 9-12 year olds need some down time with some casual reading. For my kids who have not experienced the blood/gore/sad realities of the drug world and abusive parents, I felt completely at ease having my 10 yr old read it. It is not a sit on the edge of your seat waiting for someone to be mutilated at any moment kind of book, but why is this necessary for it to be a good read for this age group? Does it HAVE to be epic to be interesting? This book is short enough that they have plenty of summer left for other books as well. I liked this book very much, and I hope to read more TB:KL books in the future. Good job Mr. Grisham!

B002RSDW80|1.0|I wanted to see if the movie treatment of the book (which I thought was just so-so) was any good.  Sad to say: it isn't. There are a lot of films that don't do justice to the books they're based upon, which is true in this case.  But the movie also introduces some disturbing elements that weren't even part of the book.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci, as Julia's husband Paul, was, as always, enjoyable to watch. Amy Adams was good at playing a whiny pain. Meryl Streep, though, really annoyed me.  She was an Ugly American, loud and obnoxious, offending the \\"refined French sensibilities.\\" Which is a lot of merde du taureau, if you ask me.<br /><br />But the movie went from being silly and dumb to being outright offensive with the subplot involving Joe McCarthy's persecution of Paul Child. (That was even worse merde du taureau.) First of all, that wasn't in the book.  I haven't read Julia Child's memoir about France, so maybe the screenwriters lifted it from that, I don't know. From what I understand, Paul was questioned briefly but the \\"investigation\\" didn't harm him or his career.  Second, Joe McCarthy was an alcoholic, and the very strong pro-Soviet element in our government had a vested interest in making him look like a nut, but even a broken clock is right twice a day. He wasn't busting little old Russian ladies having tea parties with their samovars--he was going after people who were plotting to bring down the U.S. government. It's too bad more politicians weren't brave enough to support what he was trying to do.  Still, at the end of the day, his efforts did throw the fear of God into foreign agents who were trying to impose a Soviet system here. (And in the REAL Soviet Union, at that time, millions of people were executed or shipped off to gulags or ruined.)<br /><br />Nora Ephron was involved in producing this film, and the fact is, EVERYTHING coming out of Hollywood that deals with the 1950's MUST DEMONIZE MCCARTHY. It's the law. So of course that agenda had to be pushed.<br /><br />Too bad, because if they'd left that little drama out, the movie might have merited another half-star.cause if they'd left that little drama out, the movie might have merited another half-star.
0780631684|5.0|FINAL DESTINATION is one of the better post-SCREAM horror films. The basic idea is lifted from the classic SOLE SURVIVOR (not to be confused w/ the wretched SOUL SURVIVORS). However, the updated, tweeked storyline is interesting enough to make FD an excellent movie in its own right. The idea of cheating death, only to have death track you down, is very cool when handled properly. The various \\"accidental\\" deaths are well-conceived, w/ the first one being a standout. FINAL DESTINATION is a superb creeper...
B001FB55H6|5.0|Only time will tell, but the Watchmen will probably turn out to be one of the  finest films ever  made, up there with Citizen kane.   When I first saw the Watchmen at the theater, although I enjoyed it,  I just didn't get it, finally when I  read the trade paperback, and then watched the directors cut of the movie, it all came together.    The watchmen isn't a Super Hero story in the traditional sense, its  essentially a science fiction  murder mystery based in a parallel Universe. with some Super heroes thrown into the mix.    If you are looking for the usual Super hero fare, then the Watchmen isn't for you.

B00328R21C|5.0|I don't know why this product is selling for so much more on this site. You can buy this from Lego dot com or walmart dot com. I wound up buying mine from walmart dot com and getting free shipping with site to store paying Lego's price of just under $25. Walmart's site is some times out of stock on this item, but it was worth me checking now and then to save $12. If this set was not available anywhere else I would say $37 (current price here) isn't that bad either because if you just wanted the minifigures from this set you would probably spend just as much and have more hassle than just getting this set.<br /><br />This set is cool has great minifigures the set is sturdy. My son is just under 4 years and it is still together. The set is kind of small, but I was able to modify it without adding any pieces to have 5 seats instead of 2, and my son loves it.
0439023483|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.  I finished it in just two days it was so hard to put down.  Even when I wasn't reading it, I still was thinking about it.  This is the first book in the series and I am hooked!  It takes place in a fictional country called Panem that the Capitol controls which is divided into districts based on industry.  Just to make sure everyone realizes the Capitol is in control, they run annual Hunger Games where they force two teens from each district to enter a competition to fight to the death in a place that the game makers pick on live TV.<br /><br />Katniss is the main character, a 16-yr-old girl who is a good hunter and who volunteers to take your younger sister's place.  The boy from her district that is also chosen has a long-time crush on her but she does not realize it until he mentions it in his interview.  Katniss struggles with not only surviving the game, but also with friendships and her feelings for Peeta, her admirer and Gale, the boy she hunted with before having to leave for the hunger games.<br /><br />There is humor in the book as well because Peeta and Katniss both have a rebellious attitude toward the Capitol and work hard at not losing their humanity.  I especially liked when they went through their training for the show.  This book is awesome!  This is a must read if you like psychological thrillers and adventure.  This is one of my all-time favorite books and I look forward to reading the rest of the series!  If you like the TV show, Survivor, you will love The Hunger Games since there are some similarities.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|Gayle Forman writes a beautiful tale of love and family. This story felt very real (and hit a little too close to home) while I was reading it.

Lisbeth Salander is slim, short, boyish, bisexual and can hold her own, physically, against anyone. She also has a photographic memory and is one of the top computer hackers in the world. Living by her own moral code and violently rejecting anyone who tries to make her conform, Lisbeth manages to steal billions of Kroner from a crook, begins living as she wishes and even collects a few friends along the way. However, after tracking down her evil father (who is responsible for virtually everything that's wrong with her and her life), he and her serial killer brother shoot her in the head and bury her alive, she, of course, digs her way out and almost finishes them off. This brings us to the end of the first two novels.<br /><br />As the third book begins: Salander is in the hospital awaiting 16 serious charges, including murder. Her father is just 2 rooms down from her. He is also recuperating and spends his days dreaming of killing his daughter. Things take off from this point. A group of friends and honest cops join together to prove Lisbeth is innocent of all charges, that the real perpetrators are an invisible unit operating within the Security Police (SAPO), the same unit responsible for Salander's odd behaviour and questionable mental state.<br /><br />From here the book becomes what I would call a police procedural. Author Stieg Larsson obviously knew the inner workings of the Swedish political establishment, the structure and purpose of the police and, of course, the newspaper industry. In The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest, Larsson lets that knowledge out as he takes us on a virtual step-by-step journey from Salander with a bullet in her head until she finishes her case in court, to the secondary character (our real hero) Mikail Blomkvist who plans to take down the CEO of the largest newspaper in the country, help the police snuff out the nest of bad cops and criminals operating within the bowels of SAPO and put together a defense strategy for Salander that has the potential to wreak revenge on virtually everyone who has ever hurt her.<br /><br />Reviewers at The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, to name a few, just don't like the phenomenal success of these three books. You can feel it all the way through their reviews. Reviews, by the way that just can't find a way to pick apart these monumental, international bestsellers. I think these reviewers just don't \\"get it.\\"<br /><br />Yes, Larsson didn't know all he should have with respect to writing fiction: he was a reporter and news editor for many years. It's a different kind of writing. Yes, he sometimes let his right wing politics loose on left wing ideals and notions.

B002ZG97E2|4.0|While not quite as wondrous or challenging as a Disney/Pixar film, \\"Despicable Me\\" is still a lot of fun, able to make audiences laugh without having to sacrifice story or character development. It's also one of the few animated films to not entertain the idea of heroes - it merely distinguishes between evil villains and not-so-evil villains, the latter apparently capable of good deeds despite their propensity for hatching diabolical schemes. Such a person is Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), who looks like a pointy-nosed Fester Addams and speaks in a pseudo-Russian accent so delightfully phony, it only adds to his charm. His goal has always been to become the world's greatest super villain, but as the film progresses, we realize that, underneath it all, he's actually a pretty nice guy.    He certainly has the means to be a criminal mastermind; within his vast secret lair beneath his looming black house, he and the goggled Dr. Nefario (voiced by Russell Brand) have overseen the creation of ray guns that can freeze people and blow things up, vehicles that can drive on surface streets but look serious enough to drill through the Earth's crust, flying machines equipped with every missile known to man, and tiny robots disguised as chocolate chip cookies. The problem is, Gru's notoriety has been overshadowed by rival super villain Vector (voiced by Jason Siegel), who looks like Bill Gates in an orange jumpsuit and lives in an obscenely secured white fortress (surveillance cameras, hundreds of missiles, trick doors, shark-infested moats - the whole nine yards). Hoping to regain his status, Gru plots his greatest heist yet: Stealing the moon.    Of course, it will have to be shrunk to a manageable size, which is why Gru needs Vector's extra special shrink ray. Here enters three orphaned girls - Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voiced by Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voiced by Elsie Fisher) - who get by selling boxes of cookies door to door; Gru adopts them, knowing that they can safely infiltrate Vector's fortress. What begins as a simple plan turns complicated when the girls start behaving like the children they are. They run around. They make noise. They touch things they're not supposed to touch. They always want to be read a story before going to bed. Aside from those things, they actually expect to be raised, a responsibility Gru has avoided after growing up with a sourpuss mother (voiced by Julie Andrews). Does he have it within himself to be a dad and a super villain?    Many animated films have scenes stolen by the antics of their supporting characters. \\"Despicable Me\\" is no exception; here, we have Gru's minions, a multitude of yellow ball-shaped one- or two-eyed creatures of unknown origin that speak fast, high-pitched gibberish and are a bit accident prone. You look at one and just can't help but want to punt it across a football field. It would probably be able to take it, judging by the hilarious physical abuse they all endure throughout the film. They're goofy, broad, and given the best sight gags, so naturally, they thoroughly upstage all the other characters every time they appear in a scene. They're even given their own epilogue segments during the end credits, which have little to do with the actual story but deftly take advantage of the film's 3-D effects.    Ah yes, the 3-D, seemingly inescapable these days. It's a process I admittedly have mixed feelings about. Sometimes is works beautifully (Disney's \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" \\"Avatar,\\" \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"). Sometimes, it's either an unnecessary gimmick (\\"Clash of the Titans,\\" \\"My Bloody Valentine 3-D\\") or a total disaster (\\"The Last Airbender\\"). I'm glad to say that it works for \\"Despicable Me,\\" especially during a scene at a boardwalk amusement park when Gru and the girls ride a roller coaster. There's also the moment when Gru makes an emergency landing in the middle of the street; the point of his shuttlecraft juts out from the screen, which momentarily made me think it would poke out my eye. Still, if you have the choice, go for traditional 2-D. Aside from paying less at the box office, you won't have to bother with the glasses, which can often times be a distraction.    Regardless of the dimension involved, \\"Despicable Me\\" is a delightful film - funny, sweet, and a triumph of animation and visual effects. Kids will enjoy it for its bright colors and physical humor, and this will almost certainly include Dr. Nefario's demonstration of a gun that emits a foul-smelling gas: \\"It was supposed to be a DART gun!\\" Gru exclaims in frustration. Adults will like it for its subtler touches, like a sign that reads \\"The Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers).\\" Everyone is sure to enjoy its good-natured spirit, especially when it's coupled with scenes of Gru's minions. Mark my words: They will be remembered long after memories of the plot have faded.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Great. There are no other superlatives.  Dianne Krall with her trio excel themselves on this disc.  She sings effortlessly and the end product is superb.   I rate her up with Fitgerald, Vaughm etc.    Listen to 'East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)   -   sheer bliss.
B002ZG98LO|2.0|\\"Predators\\" begins with Adrien Brody coming to in mid-freefall, which is a first for me as a moviegoer. We don't exactly know where he fell from, but we do know that he's literally falling from the sky, and only at the last second does he realize he's equipped with a parachute, which miraculously pops open. Regardless, his landing is rough; he plummets through dense jungle foliage before ending up in a muddy clearing. Over the next few minutes, he meets - and is nearly killed by - seven other people, all having mysteriously fallen from the sky. No one knows where they are, nor do they know how or why they came to be there. They last thing they remember is seeing a flash of light.    Brody's character is a soldier-turned-mercenary named Royce. Isabelle (Alice Braga) is an Israeli Defense Force sniper. Cuchillo (Danny Trejo) is a Mexican drug cartel enforcer. Mombasa (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) is a former RUF death squad officer from Sierra Leone. Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov) is a Russian VDV commando. Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) is a Japanese Yakuza assassin. Stans (Walton Goggins) is a death-row inmate from San Quentin Prison. All of them have arrived in his jungle heavily armed; the only exception is Stans, who only has a knife. That's when Royce begins flaunting his uncanny ability to make completely accurate connections with little to no information: They were all chosen to be here because they have all killed people. The only one he can't make sense of is Edwin (Topher Grace), a doctor who has had no defense training and lacks weapons of a military nature.    A view from higher ground reveals that they are no longer on Earth. The sky looks like an illustration from a science fiction magazine, with bizarre pink clouds swirling around gigantic moons and what looked to me like Jupiter. How convenient that they should land on a planet so like our own - covered with water, encased in a breathable atmosphere, in command of the same levels of gravity despite the orbiting moon that looks about twice the size of ... but never mind. As they explore the region, Edwin comes across a diabolical looking barbed plant and uses his scalpel to extract some goop from its petals, which he claims is a neurotoxin. This isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that he names the plant by its genus and species; this means that (a) he somehow knows intimate details about the plant life of an alien planet, and that (b), no matter where you are in the universe, nomenclature is based in Latin.    Back to the plot. In the jungle, our ruthless killers find a series of crashed crates, which contain unknown organic matter. They then stumble onto a series of booby traps, all set by a former hostage whose body now lies rotting against a tree stump. Once again, amazingly, Royce figures it out: They're all being hunted in a game preserve. It's right around then that all the big, nasty creatures start coming out of the woodwork, including spiny dog-like quadrupeds and, of course, the classic Predator warriors, with their dreadlocked heads and toothy fish-like mouths. A lot of shooting occurs between now and the end of the movie, which begs the question of where they're getting fresh supplies of ammo, since they had only so much of it when they were dropped onto the planet in the first place ... but never mind.    I'm well aware that science fiction/action/horror/adventure films aren't all that invested in plausibility, and I'm perfectly fine with that. That isn't the issue, anyway. \\"Predators\\" is a morass of plot holes and inconsistencies, a film that doesn't follow the very rules it took the time to set. How can we possibly get into the stunts, the violence, and the gore if we're mentally pausing every five minutes to question what we've just seen and why it happened? Perhaps I'm too picky, but I'm sorry, even pure escapist films should be bound by some kind of logic.    It doesn't help that many of the characters are unlikeable. Stans in particular is a man sovile that I actually found myself hoping he would be dead before the end of the movie. I leave it to you to find out whether or not this comes to pass. As for Royce, there's no accounting for his ability to figure out exactly what's going on and why, so in the end, he comes off as nothing more than an arrogant tough guy with no sense of compassion. Some of my issues with him have to do with the casting of Adrien Brody, which felt all wrong. Never once did I believe him as a mercenary, an ex-soldier, or even a generic survivalist, and I don't care how often he swears or much mud he smears across his face and chest. What about someone like Jason Statham or Gerard Butler? Cliché choices, no question, but at least we know they work well in action films. Unfortunately, I don't think even they could have saved \\"Predators\\" from falling through one of its own plot holes.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I've been using this headset for over a month now, and I like them. I read alot of reviews before I bought them. I dont really have anything to add that you cant read in the other reviews, but I can confirm a few pro's and con's that were in conflict in some of the other reviews. one complaint was about a constant buzzing/humming sound, yes there is a constant anoying sound when you have your controller plugged in, ( charge cord for wireless controller ) but when you take the charge cord off and use a wireless controller, the sound pretty much goes away for the most part. Another complaint was about the clip breaking. Mine was broke in the first week somehow, I dont konw how, nobody else uses or touches them, its a plastic clip with a metal spring and pin, the plastic part that holds the pin is too thin for the metal sping and pin... I dont use the clip anyways it just sits on the arm of my sofa chair. The ear cups are plenty big for my ears, and I havent noticed any black stuff on my ears like some people said happened to them. They do have surround sound, I can hear distinct sounds like footsteps coming from different directions and I konw which way to look. My wife is happy that she doesent have to hear loud gunshots and explosions anymore, but she still complains about me shouting at the tv lol. I gave them 4 stars only because of the buzzing sound and the poor clip design. I can play without both of those bothering me, but other people might not be able too. As of right now, this is the only headset made by turtle beach that works with both the PS3 and Xbox 360. If anyone has any questions, my junk email is soloissick83@aim.com or if you have Xbox live its MonkeyW1thaGun ( Monkey with a Gun )the letter i is actually the #1 I hope this review is helpful.
B000W4HIX6|4.0|First in the series and best until the last one.  Decent plot and good acting for movie with more gun shots than spoken words.  If you are into action movies then you will like this one.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|\\"Predators\\" is a worthy follow-up to the 1987 Schwarzenneger original. In fact, this could be the best movie in the Alien/Predator series since then.    \\"Predators\\" returns the action to the jungle, only we're not on Earth anymore. A group of proven soldiers, all from different nationalities and backgrounds, find themselves dropped onto this alien planet, the Predator homeworld. Together, they have to fight their way out.    The characters are all likable, especially the heroic Russian agent Nikolai and the crazy-yet-funny convict, Stans. Adrien Brody is also convincing as a seasoned soldier, and he certainly worked out enough to dismiss anyone who said he wasn't physically right for the role.    Other stand-outs are the compassionate but deadly Isabelle and the panicky doctor, Edwin, as well as the silently lethal Yakuza member, Hanzo, who faces a Predator one-on-one. Laurence Fishburne may be the most impressive in his role as Nolan, an eccentric scavenger who's survived on the planet for \\"10 seasons\\".    Another strong point is that most of the music in the movie was based on the score from the first Predator, which was one of the reasons that movie was so memorable.    This is a sequel that Predator fans should go crazy for. It's got the badass action and characters, memorable lines, epic action sequences, TWO bloody final battles. It's the type of R-Rated action movie that hasn't been seen much lately, and if you're a Predator fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|I realize a lot of people believe Portishead is downright incredible, and perhaps even going so far as to believe this band could pass as the saviours of the rather stagnant music scene taking place currently.  I think they're just decent.    As far as vocal melodies are concerned, Third gets the job done... but just barely.  This is definitely not an immediately accessible album by any means.  It takes several careful listens to fully appreciate.  Who knows, maybe I don't fully appreciate the majority of these tunes right now, hence my 4 star rating (a rating that could very well change to a 5 in the future).    \\"We Carry On\\" has a pretty repetitive vocal melody that seriously sounds like two or three notes constantly going on and on for several minutes.  I can't explain how exactly, but these specific vocals *do* grow on me with repeated listens.      Perhaps because, with repeated listens, my mind tends to focus less on the vocals and more on the creepy as heck background arrangements (which most certainly *are* fascinating most of the time).    \\"Small\\" has some rather disturbingly quiet female vocals in the beginning that gradually build into a really bizarre and experimental instrumental section halfway through.  This is the kind of experimentation that wouldn't be out of place on a Roxy Music or Brian Eno album.      Of course those musicians were the masters- this is just merely passable.  I like it though.  Come to think of it, the conclusion of this song sounds suspiciously similar to a song from Roxy Music's debut.  Probably just a coincidence.    Wow, \\"Threads\\" is REALLY darn cool.  It takes the creepy arrangements from the rest of the album and positively *forces* me to become drawn to them this time around.  My favorite song on Third.    Portishead does have the songwriting skills, the interesting atmosphere and arrangements, and the potential to one day release a masterpiece.  This album comes very close to flooring me.
0756405890|5.0|This is the big one.  No, really.  You know that fantasy you've been waiting for?  The new series containing a character you'll actually care about, themes that uplift the spirit, and on top of all that a plot that's actually damn good?  That's what Rothfuss has done.    The Name of the Wind is stunning fantasy, full of gorgeous prose and relatable characters and situations.  Kvothe is probably the best narrator I've read since I first discovered FitzChivalry Farseer (and taking into account how I've idealized Fitz in the years since...he might be even better.  Gasp!)    Don't get me wrong: it IS a debut novel, and there are a few minor issues.  Rothfuss has a tendency to give contrived \\"Dun Dun DUN!\\" endings to his chapters, and on rare occasions, when he tries to put across a strong image, he ends up straying over the fine line between profound and just...kinda goofy.  There are also some points where Rothfuss's love of his academic setting causes to the action to drag a little.      But you know what?  These concerns amount to the grand total of nada, nill, zilch, zip, nothing to me.  I only include them in the interest of a more complete review.  Rothfuss has what I love in a fantasy author: he has PASSION.  Passion for his work, his characters, and his world.  He truly wants you to love this story as much as he does, and that makes it a true joy to read.    I'd say something like \\"Go forth and rest ye not until the book is within thy grasp\\", but it just looks hyperbolic rather than clever on the page.  So let me just say, if you want a great fantasy novel with an interesting main character you can connect with, give The Name of the Wind a look.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This book by the amazing Foer has turned my wife and I into vegetarians.  If you aren't prepared to radically change your eating habits then do not read it.
055357342X|5.0|No, really, it will.  This is in my view the best of A Song of Ice and Fire (so far).  And in case you for some reason haven't read the first two installments yet, this means a hell of a lot.  ASOIAF is very likely the best fantasy series still in the making, and one of the best of all time.  Wheel of Time?  Ha.  WoT hasn't been fit to lick this book's boots since The Fires of Heaven.    I'm going to avoid plot summary in this review, both because there is so much of it, and because I really don't want to reveal anything that could spoil your enjoyment of it when it occurs.  But the plot is as fresh as ever, shocking and swift-moving, full of spine-tingling coups and incredible cliff-hangers.  The characters are balanced well (which isn't always the case, as most who read epic fantasy can attest), and the dialogue is better than you can believe, for the most part.      There are a few storylines which drag a little on occasion, granted.  But those that succeed more than make up for them, and Martin's continuing ability to force his readers to sympathize with anyone (really.  ANYONE.  Just wait) is astounding.    In the end, all I can really say about this book that will come close to describing what the reading experience was like for me is that on at least three occasions I started shouting out loud, and on one, I felt compelled to go for a run, just to blow off steam.  It's that good.    All of this praise comes with a single warning: if you have not read Martin's books before and are considering purchasing them for yourself or someone else, please take into account the fact that they are very dark at parts, and very gritty (that's good gritty, balanced by charm, but still...the march through ASOS is strewn with blood, sex, and the splintered fragments of various taboos).  So if, say, Drizzt Do'Urden and His Amazing Platonic Pals are about your speed, in terms of fantasy...take care.  This has the capacity to shock young or sensitive readers.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Tootsie was an outragiously funny movie.  In 1982 I saw this movie with my mom and my grandmother.  I had blast watching this movie with two favorite women in my life.  We had a great time watching this movie and laughing so hard that i remember almost falling out of my seat. Dustin Hoffman was so great in this movie. He really new how to pull off a dress and heels. If you love funny movies this one needs to be added to your collection.

B003FMTZOM|4.0|What a relief that Christina Aguilera has left \\"Back To Basics\\" and found herself back in the future. Abandoning efforts to outdo Aretha and Mariah, she has concentrated on just making good pop music, diving back into today's genre. The odd thing is, Christina was Britney's rival in the past, and she is now being eclipsed by the star of the moment, Lady Gaga; but this album sounds like the child of a union between those two, at least in the upbeat numbers, with some Gwen Stefani and Adam Lambert added for good measure.  And it works. In fact, it is terrific - spirited, confident, adamant.<br /><br />\\"Bionic\\" is a good title for the album, because the upbeat tracks have a metallic, space-age, engineered sound. The lyrics are sexy, sly and aggressive, as dance music lyrics are prone to be.  A group of these upbeat tracks comprise the first half of the album.  One of the best is the title track: \\"Bionic, hit you like a rocket, hey!\\" \\"Elastic Love\\", another standout, has a cyber-ish, almost mechanical vocal with lots of cyber effects.  \\"Desnudate\\" includes some intriguing lyrics sung in Spanish.<br /><br />Things get considerably quieter beginning with \\"Sex For Breakfast\\".  There are several ballads, and they feature melodic singing, often uncharacteristically soft - more VOCALIZING OF THE LYRICS, and less emoting, less of those showy, complicated, distracting melismas that on her previous two albums she took about as far as anyone could desire.  \\"Sex For Breakfast\\" has a classic R&B sound.  The best ballads are \\"Lift Me Up\\" and \\"You Lost Me\\".  Both are quietly dramatic within traditional adult contemporary arrangements.  \\"I Am\\", with its simple word-game descriptions, sounds like it could be an Alanis Morissette song, and Christina sings it beautifully.<br /><br />With \\"I Hate Boys\\", \\"My Girls\\" and \\"Vanity\\", we return to hot dance-pop territory. In \\"Vanity\\" (\\"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the flyest b**** of them all, never mind, I am!\\") we get a stunning sample of what Christina can still do with those incredible pipes.  Near the end of the song, she holds, stretches and varies a long, loud note, clearly and effortlessly.<br /><br />The one negative thing I can say is that if you don't take to the album, you will think it goes on and on, too much and too long.  But if you like it, you'll really, really like it.ll do with those incredible pipes.  Near the end of the song, she holds, stretches and varies a long, loud note, clearly and effortlessly.

B00005JNX0|1.0|I would like to watch this movie, but the discs don't work. I first bought the Madagascar (Widescreen) DVD. Two different computers and two different DVD media software programs refused to play the disc. I waited a long time and got the Blu-Ray version, which refuses to play on a laptop purchased just last November 2010. The movie is not available on Amazon's video on demand or on iTunes. End result: I didn't get to see it at the theater and don't have more than basic cable. I've now bought two non-working discs. I guess I'll have to wait for it on iTunes or find a friend who has it, because I don't want to be fooled a third time into paying for another disc.    Sure, the movie may be great, but I'll never know, because neither the DVD nor the Blu-Ray will play. I feel like I've been robbed twice. I was looking forward to a fun romp of a movie. Maybe if it ever comes on iTunes I can rent it. Bah.
B000YJ54DU|2.0|Just one darn detail after another. But there was no there there. Reacher knows something is wrong, but he just doesn't know what it is, so we are treated with his following one blind lead after another. Finally he figures it out, but by then I was just looking for the end of the book. Some of the elements should have worked. There were potentially effective war protest ideas, for example. But there was one description after another of Reacher climbing a wall or sneaking around or driving down a road. Give me back Nancy Drew for effective formula writing...
B002JIOO76|5.0|I literally just finished reviewing I CAN SEE YOUR HOUSE FROM HERE, so I won't repeat any of that. I will recommend this one, as well, and point out a few stand out tracks. Firstly, I will say that this is, of course, another \\"sucker punch\\" from this great group, and as I type these words I am listening to a live recording of their brilliant SONG WITHIN A SONG just to set the mood... ah, the flute has just begun its soothing proem to the body of the song... \\"the sun has left the sky... now you can close your eyes... leave all the world behind until tomorrow\\"... what a great prelude to sleep... anyway... I digress (but what a fabulous, and relevant digression)... the title track is a standout, as is PRESSURE POINTS... REFUGEE, and LONG GOODBYES should also catch your ear, and, perhaps, make it on to your customized BEST OF CAMEL... to those new to this group, I should also, in proper conscience, recommend three others: NUDE, MOONMADNESS and RAIN DANCES. I mention these recordings because this triumvirate of vinyl virtuosity is what converted me to a CAMEL fan back in 1982, and recently, I decided to try to acquire all I can from this stellar band. I knew STATIONARY TRAVELLER existed, but with the advent of the CD reissues and digital remastering I knew it was time to visit some of the more obscure work by this group a bit closer. This one does not disappoint. Balthazar says \\"Check it out.\\"
B0038QGXHW|1.0|18 5 star reviews!  Amazing...did I get the same recording?  I  read the liner notes about how romantic this music was and prepared to be entranced.  Sorry, I listened to it several times in different moods and at different times of day to make certain and it left me totally cold.  I'm a huge fan of jazz pianists like Kenny Barron, Bill Charlap, Fred Hersch, Mulgrew Miller, McCoy Tyner, Andre Previn, Marcus Roberts, Jean-Michel Pilc, Dave Brubeck, Tommy Flanagan, Eddie Higgins, Shelly Berg, Bill Evans, Gene Harris and Dan Nimmer.  KJ should have left this one in the can.  I did particularly enjoy \\"The Melody At Night With You\\" which is what I was hoping this recording would resemble.  It does not. I have 8 or 9 of Jarrett's other recordings which I like well enough.  I tried to get into this but I'm not hearing it guys.  It's flat toned background music with no sparkle.  Also, I'm tired of ECM not numbering the CD tracks-like that would be less than artsy. It's just convenient folks.  And finally the lack of art work of any caliber must save them a ton of money.
B003IB38UM|4.0|Abba's 'disco' album from 1979 has been released on CD many times but this is definitely the best one yet. Unlike the previous reviewer, I followed them from 'Waterloo' onwards. None of that nasty punk stuff for me!<br /><br />Following 'Abba-The Album' and 'Arrival' was never going to be easy. The group were trying to move with the times and 'Voulez-Vous' was the danciest album they were to put out. After the aforementioned previous LPs, it was considered something of a disappointment and was the first of their UK released albums not to spawn a #1 single. Of course many acts would kill to have anything nearing the quality of this set of songs but by Abba's standards, it wasn't their best.<br /><br />The excellent booklet makes mention of the group's struggle to put the record together. There was a general lack of inspiration around the project and initial lead single, 'Summer Night City' was left off the LP after it performed poorly (by Abba standards) on the charts. 'If It Wasn't For The Nights' was set to be the new first single but this never came to pass. Like much of the LP, it has a shrill, trying-too-hard feel to it and I'm not convinced, unlike other fans, that this track would have been the album's salvation.<br /><br />'Chiquitita' became the lead single with the proceeds going to Unicef at the start of 1979. I've always seen it as a poor man's 'Fernando' and like several tracks on 'Voulez-Vous', it's far too long. The second single, the rocky 'Does Your Mother Know', was better but 'only' made #4 in the UK charts. Indeed, the biggest hit came at the end of the year, 'I Have A Dream' got to #2.<br /><br />31 years on, the album still isn't one of my favourites. This edition is actually far stronger than the original release adding 5 bonus tracks, including 'Gimme, Gimme, Gimme', 'Lovelight' and the wondrous 'Dream World', a song Benny and Bjorn hated and which remained unreleased for years.<br /><br />I say this album is disappointing only as an Abba one, mind. The production, harmonies and often the song construction are mind-blowing to say the least, but I have to say the subsequent 'Super Trouper' album was far better to my ears.<br /><br />The DVD is hit and miss, I suppose. The 'Abba In Switzerland' TV special is OK (but omits guest appearances by Kate Bush and Roxy Music) and guest slots on 'The Mike Yarwood Show, the Unicef concert and 'Multi Coloured Swap Shop' are fun to see again though the group steadfastly mime through all these shows for some reason. A few ads and a sleeve gallery are also included but these weren't of enormous interest to me.<br /><br />Although it's not my favourite Abba release, this Deluxe Edition of 'Voulez-Vous' is is absolutely worth getting and is beautifully packaged.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|This movie stinks!  I am so happy I didn't pay $12 for the 3D version.  I waited to see it at the dollar theater on .75 cent night :)    The 2010 version has no flow and very poor character development.  What a disappointment!  But hey, what should we expect from Hollywood and it's new obsession for crappy remakes of great films.  What's next Star Wars?      The original 1981 version even with the old school claymation special effects blows this silly remake away!    In a perfect world we would get a 30th anniversary DVD/Blu-Ray edition of the original with updated special effects on side A and original version on side B.
B001EN71CW|4.0|[[ASIN:B001EN71CW Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]]]    I am only going to talk about one complaint about the packaging. The copy of the Blu-ray Firefly: The Complete Series that I received from Amazon had no Episode Guide in the case. Went to Fox Home Entertainment website, and asked them to send me a replacement copy of the missing Episode Guide. Absolute no response from Fox Home Entertainment. Contacted Amazon about the problem and was sent a replacement copy in 2 days, opened the replacement copy, guess what no Episode Guide again. Contacted both Fox Home Entertainment and Amazon customer service again, received a call right away from Amazon who was very sorry that Firefly: The Complete Series had been problematic, absolutely no response from Fox Home Entertainment. Received a discount from Amazon but that really did not solve the problem of the missing Episode Guide. Here is a link to see the missing Episode Guide [...] Hope this helps someone.
B003KUSUNG|3.0|This 20th anniversary deluxe edition isn't much different than the separate releases [which are getting hard to find]. It's not remastered [or no indication of it]. It still has the same Dolby 5.1. 2.0 and DTS. It still has the same tracks on CDs and DVDs - except now in one package. The only thing that was included are a replica of the original concert ticket and a mini replica of the original concert programme. There are no DVD extras.<br /><br />What I found odd is how the tracks were chosen. The total length of the DVDs is just over 3 hours. Obviously the 2 CDs can add up to no more than 127 minutes. THe odd part is that there are tracks on the DVD which aren't on the CDs - which is obvious - but there are also tracks on the CDs that aren't on the DVDs such as Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb, Genesis' Throwing It All Away, Eric Clapton's Sunshine Of Your Love and Elton John's Saturday Night's All Right (For Fighting).<br /><br />DVD #2 is just over an hour. Clearly they could of added some additional footage and music on the CDs.<br /><br />That said, the concert is probably one of the best single day charity concerts.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|Rented this film not knowing anything about it and absolutely loved it!!  Originally we were looking for a scary movie which this movie does not really qualify.  It was, however, creepy and grabbed my attention from the get go. Thought about it for days afterwards.  I read the bad reviews that people left for the movie and feel that they didn't give it enough time or focus or simply weren't smart enough to get it.  This is a great movie and my only disappointment is that it's not widespread and did not make much money.    If you haven't seen the movie, do NOT read on from here.    I felt the end of the movie was extremely well done.  You realize that all of this is happening because she was an abusive mother to her autistic child.  The movie \\"begins\\" with her dying in the car crash and then continually going through her own personal hell.  Brilliantly contrived and executed.  At first, the movie starts kind of cheesy with the standard characters on the sailboat but it all changed when they died in the first 15 minutes of the movie.  For me, it went from a very obvious slasher film to a well done, thought out plot that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Kudos for this movie.  If you also enjoyed it, make sure to tell your friends.  At least the cast/crew can make some money on DVD sales.

B000R9EG3Q|3.0|Barack Obama is the product of a black Kenyan father and a white American mother from Kansas. His story is that of cultural confusion and crisis of identity and purpose.    Obama's father abandoned him and his mother while Barack was a toddler. Barack's mother remarried an Indonesian man, and the three relocated to Jakarta. Barack attended elementary school in Indonesia, but his mother sent him back to Hawaii to attend private prep school while living with his maternal grandparents.    As a teenager in Hawaii, Barack became aware that he was white and black, but acquired a persistent confusion as to which culture he belonged. He grew to resent white people, while feeling slighted for being black.    All of his male role models as a youth were weak and seriously flawed.    He attended Occidental College in LA and later transferred to Columbia in New York. In search of his cultural identity and purpose in life, Obama became a community organizer in Chicago. After three years of accomplishing little in the housing projects of the South Side he left for Harvard. But first he would visit his father's homeland in Kenya.    Barack's father died a couple of years earlier in a car accident in Kenya. Barack has a dozen half brothers and sisters living in Kenya and numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins. In the end, Barack learns that his estranged father and his grandfather too suffered from identity and cultural confusion.    The book explains the traumas of growing up black in the US. Obama discovers that the social, political, and economic pathologies on the South Side of Chicago are the same in Kenya.    The book is needlessly wordy. Obama admits that a new rewrite would easily cut 50 pages from the total 450.    Barack's mother died shortly after this memoir was published. He writes that had he realized that she was dying, he would have concentrated more on his appreciation of the parent who was there for him instead of meditating upon the one who was absent.    For a decidedly different response to the difficulties of growing up black in the US, I recommend \\"My Grandfather's Son\\" by Justice Clarence Thomas.

0439023483|2.0|It took me a year and a half to finish this book. I picked it up on a flight to Japan and read almost all the way through it, but stopped before reaching the end (I finally finished it about a month ago). It wasn't the gore that made me put the book down, but the dull and plagiarized storyline. I don't want to sound like a broken record, but I too am a huge fan of Koushun Takami's \\"Battle Royale,\\" and I love the idea of corrupt governments initiating a fight-to-the-death match between children. Collins could have done so much with the storyline, but her book was a flop.<br /><br />First of all (and most disappointing), was the cheesy romance. It did not fit the theme of the book at all. This was supposed to be a story about pitting children against children until one was left standing. In a book like that, there is no room for corny proclamations of love. It was utterly ridiculous, too overdone and ultimately took away from the storyline.<br /><br />Another deal breaker for me was that almost half of the story took place outside of the arena. Some of it was interesting but mostly it was a bland description of training and a cheesy scene where the couples prance around in costumes.<br /><br />Because \\"The Hunger Games\\" was partially entertaining, and I do admit to enjoying the twist at the end, I'd recommend it to a friend. Although, before people begin to praise Collins as \\"THE NEXT J.K. ROWLING,\\" or something, they should check out \\"Battle Royale\\" to read a true fight-to-the-death masterpiece.

B002TYZKIM|4.0|The 2000 decade proved to be very harsh physically and emotionally for Michael Jackson, with bad press from start to finish, until the very end of his life on June 25th, 2009. He accused his label Sony and executive Tommy Mattola of racism, after failing to fairly promote his final album Invincible back in 2001, which was his lowest-selling on the label only striking double platinum. He was also tested, accused of child molestation from a targeted sting, which lead to a 2005 trial that he would be later cleared from all charges, and his private affairs financially from being in debt and his personal life were made in public in a heartbreaking manor. Yet, he was in desperate need of aid. He was set to go back to the stage for one last time in London for what was suppose to be his final tour called, This Is It. While the tour didn't happen because of his death, a movie that was around the tour came around due to the demands of his music selling again, and people pondering on what could've been from the departed King Of Pop.<br /><br />Michael Jackson's This Is It which wasn't suppose to be released this way, but released because of the buying from Sony for $60 Million, focused on how hard Michael Jackson was making the attempt to comeback to the music industry, after years of public targeting that affected his career. The documentary focused on the special effects strongly from mini-movies he was making which centered around his songs from Thriller and the somber Earth Song, all the way to going back to basics with simple standard performances from his biggest hits including Man In The Mirror and Billie Jean. It was so amazing how much he wanted to make that try at the brass ring which didn't happen in the tragic way it could've. Michael's vocals also seemed a bit rusty in the film, and not up to the kind of razzle-dazzle he had from before, largely due to the absence from singing and touring for a longtime, and his body looked really fraille from the abuse he had gone thorugh. Yet, he was trying to build it up all over again very steadily, but it didn't happen to be that way from what could've been that July at the O2 Arena in London.<br /><br />All in all, I honestly found it very difficult to watch This Is It, even one year after he sadly lost his life in the uproar that it caused that June 25th. Still, it is a delightful treat for hard core fans of Michael Jackson from start to finish. This Is It is a gripping glimpse of what made Michael Jackson a perfectionist at making what was suppose to be his last shows so strong. Kenny Ortega did a enduring and tough job, at putting the pieces of this film together, and through it all remains a great buy for King Of Pop fans young and old.<br /><br />Story: B-<br /><br />Extras: B<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-h.

B002VECLVO|5.0|It's an all-around great movie. Who would have thought that fashion designer Tom Ford could make a movie such as this. The whole cast does an excellent job, but Colin Firth especially stands out. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the music is hauntingly beautiful. The story is melancholy, but not depressing - there is a life-affirming quality to it.
B003HE2B9E|5.0|This CD is a re-release of Believe. The main goal was to add more radio friendly songs and to make a more cohesive pop/rock CD.    Four new tracks. Shut Up and Kiss me, Courage, Missing you(John Waite Cover), and Addicted to love. Bad News and Think Like a Man got new treatments.    Three tracks were removed. Untogether, Drive away and God only knows. These are actually some of the best tracks on believe but were removed because they made shift in direction of the CD. Do check them out.    To review this CD as a whole you can't really judge this CD based on Orianth's potential or based on other genres. This was meant to be a commercial pop/rock CD and as such you won't find a pop/rock CD of this quality and force unless you go back to the 80s. What sets it apart from today's pack the is Orianthi's smoking guitar work and strong vocals. It's not often a vocalist is also a guitarist of the highest order.    Highlights include: According to you - a great pop/rock anthem, Suffocated - blistering guitar driven rock song, Courage - a sweet mid tempo ballad showcasing Orianthi's vocals, Highly Strung - epic guitar instrumental with Steve Vai, Addicted to love - fierce hard rock/pop/dance fusion.
0446563048|5.0|I actually read a mixed review before I started this book so my expectations weren't extremely high, but I was pleasantly surprised with the insights, knowledge and inspiration I received after reading it.  I enjoyed Tony's personal stories and the path he took to get where he is today.  I am a firm believer in the importance of corporate culture and its effect on the productivity of a staff.  It's nice to find affirmation of this in this book and get a inside view of life at Zappos.  More importantly as an aspiring entrepreneur and someone looking for a deeper meaning in life, I was left asking myself deep questions like, \\"what makes me happy?\\" and \\"what am I truly passionate about?\\"  I immediately passed the book along to my husband and we've been discussing it ever since.  I've also made myself a list of additional books to read that were recommended by Tony and that are a part of Zappo's library.      I do think the book jumped around a bit feeling like an autobiography at the beginning, a summary of Zappos culture and finally as a motivational book at the end.  But overall I got a lot out of this book and would like to know more about all three.
0142410322|3.0|Here's what my 4 and 6yr old have to say about it. We just finished it after reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which they loved. They liked this one less than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but they still looked forward to reading it every night. It's true that it got boring when the characters floated around in space for so long, but they liked the part when the grandparents ate the pills--it led to a lot of mathematical calculations about how old their parents would be depending on how many pills we ate (each one makes you 20 yrs younger). Recommended!
B003N7GATM|4.0|Lots of different sounds on this one, but it's only meant as a preview of things to come from this little venture. So far, I really like it. I LOVE \\"A Drowning\\" and \\"The Space In Between\\" others are cool and catchy, but they don't match the great lyrics, tone, and chills these two give. Remember to download for free from their website or buy the high-def version :)
0307474712|4.0|Perfect read for summer, not too heavy but definitely not a trashy throw-away novel!  I actually heard this author interviewed on NPR not too long ago and was intrigued by the concept of the book.  The writing flows so well, making it so easy to stay up until 3:30 in the morning because you have to know what happens next!  David Nicholls does a great job of creating 'real' characters, not just Dexter and Emma, but most everyone in the book; the traits/personalities of the characters I think is what really makes this book so good.  You can really see people developing in these brief little vignettes into their lives each year and start experiencing their pains, frustrations and successes as they do.  I know there is talk of this becoming a movie and you can definitely see how this would be watchable.  I just hope Hollywood doesn't ruin a great story as they are wont to do! I will definitely be passing this around to my friends and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great light read with a captivating story.
B003EPPEP4|4.0|If you thought Renee Olstead was something in her teen years, you haven't heard anything until you get a load of Nikki Yanofsky.  She is Canada's version of Renee, and a very lively singer on top of it.  Standards like \\"Take the 'A' Train\\" and \\"I Got Rhythm\\" come alive with Nikki, who credits Ella Fitzgerald as her main influence.  Original tracks show Nikki's willingness to make it into the pop world, but she shows her boldness in mashing up \\"On The Sunny Side Of The Street\\" with the Led Zeppelin hit \\"Fool In The Rain\\" (showing her leanings toward classic rock).  Nikki is one girl to be reckoned with in the world of jazz.

0307387151|5.0|Where to start with this book...  This was an amazing book!  Atonement  is told from many different points of views:  Briony Tallis, Cecilia Tallis, and Robbie Turner. Briony Tallis is introduced to as a 13-year old who has a passion for writing, and for creating imagined worlds.  Cecilia Tallis, Briony's older sister, is more concerned with relaxing and smoking while her mother has one of her \\"headaches\\".  Robbie Turner, a son of one of the household maids, dreams about going to college for medicine.<br /><br />The main events behind the whole pot of this book all occur in a single day.  Briony misinterprets an interaction taken place between Cecilia and Robbie while looking out her window.  To add to Briony's imagination of what she \\"thinks\\" took place she intercepts a note written by Robbie addressed to Cecilia.  Robbie gave this note by accident, with the intended note still at his house. Inside this note sexual and personal thoughts of Robbie's send Briony's thoughts array.  Later on Briony see's an intimate event take place between Robbie and Cecilia, not understanding at all what it means - she believes that Robbie has \\"assaulted\\" Cecilia and is thus a bad man.  If this wasn't bad enough, one of Briony's cousins is found violated later that night in the woods.  Briony automatically believes and accuses Robbie as the assailant.<br /><br />Briony's accusation sets in motion the events for the rest of the book - Robbie is given the choice to either go to Jail or to serve in the Army; he chooses the Army, which changes him completely.  Cecilia becomes a nurse, as she too is changed by Briony's accusation.  As Briony grows up she starts to question her actions and realizes her mistake.  Can she ever make up for the pain and heartache she has caused, for tearing apart two people who loved each other?
B003BKF696|5.0|Before I decided to buy this cd, I'd never heard of the National. Indeed, at first, I thought that I had read that there were only two band members. The National is a Brooklyn-based indie rock band formed in Cincinnati [hence \\"Ohio Blood Buzz\\"] in 1999. The band's lyrics are written and sung by Matt Berninger, a very low-key, but precise baritone. The rest of the band is composed of two pairs of brothers: Aaron  and Bryce Dessner and Scott and Bryan Devendorf. Aaron plays guitar, bass and piano, Bryce plays guitar, Scott plays bass and guitar, and Bryan is the drummer - and a very fine drummer he is, indeed. Padma Newsome, from another band often adds strings, keyboards, and other instrumental layering. The National has an acclaimed indy history, though, after listening to High Violet, I found nothing of its caliber in the older albums, though they are good. Nothing to indicate the radical departure the group has taken.       The debut album, the eponymous The National was released in 2001 on Brassland Records, a label founded by band members Aaron and Bryce Dessner, among others. The 12 songs were an array of country/bar room/pop. I particularly liked \\"Beautiful Head\\", for its delicate roots orientation.       The National's second album, Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers, was released in 2003, and, like the previous album, was received favorably, though impact was not widespread.       In 2004, the band released an EP, Cherry Tree, which included the live favorite \\"About Today,\\" as well as \\"All the Wine\\". The EP evoked further positive reaction, and its success landed them a successful tour.      Their 2005 album, Alligator, was met with much critical acclaim and featured highly in \\"Album of the Year\\" charts. Some reviews hailed it as one of the top records of the decade. Alligator sold over 80,000 copies.      The National's fourth album, Boxer, came out 2007, and critical acclaim grew. A number of TV shows (and some movies) began using The National music. The songs \\"Fake Empire\\" and \\"Start a War\\" were featured. Music videos and a full-length documentary on the band followed.      Word of what would become High Violet began to spread in 2008. The National performed live versions of \\"England,\\" \\"Bloodbuzz Ohio,\\" \\"Vanderlylle Cry Baby\\" (later retitled \\"Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks\\"), \\"Terrible Love,\\" \\"Conversation 16,\\" \\"You and Your Sister\\" (later retitled \\"Lemonworld\\"), \\"Sorrow,\\" \\"Anyone's Ghost,\\" \\"Believe Me\\" (previously called \\"The Blue Sky\\" and \\"A Thousand Black Cities\\"), and \\"Karamazov\\" (a reference to Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, a band favorite), which was retitled on the album as \\"Runaway\\". Thus, the genesis of High Violet       High Violet is absolutely stunning. In my opinion it is far above the group's previous work, though I would definitely pick up copies of Boxer and Alligator. High Violet is far more, somehow, than the sum of its parts. At first listen, I loved the album, but I thought that it might be too much of a good thing, that it wouldn't last as I listened to it over time. I was wrong. The more I listen, the more I hear and the more the songs become part of me - if I had the voice, I could sing them. I can hear that thought and invention were put into virtually every second, and new details emerge continually over time. There is not a single weak song.       I would have written a review far sooner, but I have difficulty finding the words to describe this album. The music does not seem to stem from any of the main basic types of American music - it is not African-American, it is not country-western, it is not jazz, it is not tin pan alley/show tune.        It is sui generis. The music is very melodic, tempos running from ballad to not quite fast paced, thick with detail (especially on \\"Terrible Love\\", which on first listen on bad speakers seemed too thick, kludgy, but over time has revealed a very precise spare swirl of artistries), powerful and almost anthemic. I think that every member of the band must befirst among equals, because everything comes together so terribly well. The lead singer's voice is highly expressive in a low, restrained way, except when it is bursting forth with a fine ringing baritone. The singer's voice and the album's themes unify it, but so does the music - at the end, it is one piece of music that happens to come in parts. Recurrent images - ocean, waves, sun, rain, souls, games, drugs, fire, New York, and flowers - create greater coherence, and, over all, even when highly emotional, the album is calm, restrained in a way that makes every detail carry greater weight.       Every single song is about pain and/or sadness - the second song is called \\"Sorrow.\\" Yet, rather than being depressing, the album is cathartic; the songs are so powerful that, while they plumb the depths, they are also sustaining, and they are so thoughtful and perceptive (and funny) that they leave one pensive. The lyrics are allusive and elusive, like good poetry. They are lean and repeated, but somehow avoid being repetitive, perhaps because one really needs to think about them as they go by. Sometimes - no often - they make little literal sense, but they are just right in their contexts, creating emotional developments that give the words sense. \\"It takes an ocean not to break.\\" What does that mean? Listen to it in the song \\"Terrible Love\\", and it will make sense. To me,anyway.       There is a very high number of memorable, if somewhat cryptic, lines. A few: \\"It's terrible love and I'm walking with spiders .../It's quiet company.\\" \\"Sorrow found me when I was young/ Sorrow waited, sorrow won.\\" \\"Awesome prince, get your sleep/ Lose your high history/ Make us laugh, or nothing will/ I set a fire just to see what it killed.\\" \\"I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees/ I never married but Ohio don't remember me.\\" \\"I still owe money to the money to the money I owe/ The floors are falling out from everybody I know.\\" I gave my heart to the army/ The only sentimental thing I could think of.\\" \\"What makes you think I enjoy being led to the flood/ We've got another thing comin' undone/ That's taking us over/ That's taking forever.\\" [Who would ever imagine that this line/song refers to Dostoyevsky?] \\"Now we'll leave the silver city, 'cause all the silver girls/ Gave us black dreams/ Leave the silver city to all the silver girls/ Everything means everything.\\" \\"I'm a confident liar/ I'll have my head in the oven so you'll know where I'll be.\\" \\"Famous angels never come through England/ England gets the ones you never need.\\" \\"All the very best of us/String ourselves up for love.\\"       And the final line of the album: \\"I'll explain everything to the geeks.\\" Actually, nothing is explained in the album, but then it shouldn't have been. High Violet is an album to let wash over you, like an ocean wave - powerful, unlike any other though repeated endlessly, having its own meaning, possibly dangerous, complex but simple. Yes.

((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))<br /><br />Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace.  Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss.  Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing.  She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is.

Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls.

B001LF347E|5.0|Love, love, love Merlin - I'm late to the fan club but I caught a marathon on Syfy channel and have been hooked ever since! I love the actors, the stories, the comedy, the special effects, superb job all around.  In particular, Colin Morgan as Merlin is fantastic and Anthony Head is someone you love to hate as Uther.  The Dragon made me laugh more than once - I just loved his attitude and I even understood his act of revenge at the end of Season 2.  I also REALLY like the way the Arthur/Gwen story has developed - Season 1, he didn't pay her any mind and you can tell there was a concerted effort to make Gwen as plain Jane as possible while Morgana was a stunning beauty.  Season 2, you notice that Gwen looks more attractive but Arthur doesn't notice the beauty, he notices the courage (when she saves his life) and her intelligence, spunk and wisdom when he stays in her home. The point is that the story of Arthur & Gwen always revolves around a love at first sight kind of meeting but I think the way the writers have chosen to tell the story, is more meaningful and a great twist on a timeless love story. A powerful and handsome man like Arthur can have any beauty in the land on his arm but as we see him grow from an arrogant boy into a more humble and considerate prince, his perspective about true beauty changes as well and I love it. They've managed to take Arthur from someone you'd despise in the first few episodes to someone you admire because he is kind and gentle, he has a good heart and is trying to learn how to be a benevolent ruler.   Even though I was able to watch all of the episodes for free (either on Syfy or youtube), it's really saying something that I want to purchase the series to have in my collection! (that's a damn good show!)

0440244870|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to finally read this book!  I absolutely loved it!  It's summer time, and it makes a perfect summer read - light, fluffy, funny, and mindless really - but in a good way.  Sometimes you just need to grab a book that can take your mind away from life and help you relax and simply enjoy reading just for the fun of it.<br /><br />The story follows Rebecca (Becky) Bloomwood - a 25 year old financial journalist who can't seem to manage her own finances - as she tries to come up with ways to C.B. (cut back) and M.M.M. (make more money) so she can get herself out of debt.  While each plan she hatches manages to fail miserably and hilariously, the only thing left to do is hit the shops and buy a little something to help her cheer up... and the cycle continues!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the author's writing and character development, and the 310 pages just flew by!  I can't wait to read Kinsella's other books in the Shopaholic series as well as the independent novels and the ones published under her real name - Madeleine Wickham.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book yet, and you're a fan of chick-lit or light summer reads - I highly recommened this book!

B001HN694K|4.0|A young person goes to a fantasy land where she has been prophesied to end the rule of an evil Queen.  She is given cryptic advice by mystical creatures and it all ends in a massive battle between the forces of Good and the forces of Evil.  It sounds more like Narnia than Wonderland to me--just with a Blue Caterpillar instead of Aslan the Lion.  Still, I enjoyed the movie.  Johnny Depp was diverting as the Mad Hatter, and Mia Warsikowska was delightful as Alice.  I also found it amusing that Alice kept having to find new clothes because the clothes she was wearing didn't grow or shrink with her!  It was nice to see Crispin Glover again.  He did a wonderful job as Stayne, the Knave of Hearts.  So even though it wasn't classic Wonderland, I do recommend this movie.
0446567337|3.0|First off, I need to make some declarations before I get into the meat of my 'review'.    1) I don't write these reviews for Amazon, or its readers. I write them for *me*. I write them to better understand the novel I've just read, to better understand what the author accomplished (while guessing at what their intent had been...sometimes not the same thing at all), to better understand what works and what doesn't, towards the eventual goal of gaining a better grasp on what great writing is, what great storytelling is, what great entertainment novels featuring these elements can be. It is a self-serving process that I offer up for other Amazon readers to take as they will.    2) I envy and admire Mr. Sparks. He's managed to carve out a niche in the marketplace, writing (presumably) what he wants to write, and has a solid fan-base encouraging him to continue doing so. What more could a modern author hope for in this day and age? (Never mind that he's had the added compliment of having several of his novels adapted for the screen.)    3) I bawled through all the 'romance' portions of this novel. It is, at the very heart of it, a testimony to not getting what you crave, when your entire being (to the extent that you're capable at the time of giving your 'entire' anything) is lost in loving someone...or at the very least, desiring them. I know of what the lead character John speaks; I've carried the burden of a 'lost love' for more than seven years now. (Even though mine was a world-class case of unrequited love.) Leading me to Point #4...    4) I'm happy for the readers for whom this book resonated. Resonance is a personal thing. And perhaps the most contentious thing I can say is that resonance does not automatically infer -or confer- quality of writing. It only means that it resonated for you...and for other people who share this experience...and that the novel provided an especially positive experience for you. It doesn't mean it's a 'great novel', no matter how manycopies it sells.      What It Isn't:    -It's not great writing.    -It's not great storytelling.    -It's not a great reading experience. (Unless you are a lover of this genre.)      What It Is:    -'Dear John' is 'genre-porn'. Pornography is generally acknowledged as material with no other inherent value -or purpose- than to stimulate a prurient reaction. 'Dear John' is a romance, further a heartbreaking romance, and so its purpose is to elicit the reactions that someone reading this genre wants to experience. That's all. It doesn't aim to elevate the reader's consciousness, it doesn't aim to illuminate Life (although there are a few nice examples in 'Dear John' when it does: adult Asberger's, the realities of armed forces personnel in Iraq not having been trained to be judge or police officers and the concomitant stress involved at still attempting to execute these duties, a general view of coin collecting), and it's not aiming to be 'great literature'. It unabashadly takes a certain tack...and Mr. Sparks does what he can to maintain it.    -It is facile but well-intentioned. On occasion it's ham-fisted...but nevertheless with an undeniable amount of acumen and ability, thanks to the author's experience and resultant skill. Unfortunately, in more than a handful of instances, it gets so mired in...well, in what can only be referred to as 'cringe-inducing' dialogue...that it threatens true mediocrity.    -It is a novel that at times has an inconsistent narrator's voice. 'Plaintive', for example, isn't a word that John -as he's revealed to us- would have used. If it had been, the entire tenor of the novel would have been shifted about seven degrees to the north/northeast. The same goes for the use of 'portending'. Ugh.    -On that note, when you have an emotionally-unevolved character acting as the narrator- Well, is that really what you want to have, given the limitations...unless you're intending on this narrator's limitations to become a huge part of the story?Because in 'Dear John', they're not. They inform the story, they affect the story, but they do not so much as to warrant taking this approach.    -It is a pleasing serving of what this genre aims to feed its patrons with, the sort of stuff that for those readers who want this kind of confection, hits the spot.
0525423842|4.0|If you are a John Grisham fan, you will appreciate reading his first mystery book for young people.  Theodore Boone is a precocious 13-year old son of two lawyers who have apparently whetted Theodore's appetite for the legal side of things.  There is a murder trial in his hometown, and with his teacher's consent, he arranges for his entire class to attend opening day of the trail to listen to opening arguments by the lawyers. Besides this trial, which Theodore must involve himself in several ways, he also helps several of his friends with their legal problems.  It's a good read, with a sort of ambiguous ending, leading us to think there will be sequels to this book.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|The best thing about this backpack is how sturdy and compact it is. That's hugely important to me when I'm carrying around my SLR gear. It seems to be made of a very thick canvas-like material and it protects my camera very well. I've used it a number of times already and I'm pleased with how it is holding up. It seems very well-made.<br /><br />The other thing I like is that the compartments inside can be moved around or just removed alltogether. When I first opened the bag I was very disappointed because I didn't think the compartments could be moved. I soon discovered that they can move and can be taken out! That makes organizing much easier. Good storage, and easy access to everything.<br /><br />My one complaint would be that the straps seem a bit small, even when you make them as \\"big\\" as you can. They seem small for an average sized adult. There is a handle at the top, however, so you can carry it by hand instead of putting it over your shoulders. That said, this is a very compact bag, which is PERFECT for airplane travel, or any kind of travel really. Having to lug something huge around is a massive pain. I like how compact this is and how easy it is to store the bag.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|The Princess and the Frog is a superbly animated, imaginative family film that shows what Disney can still accomplish with good old 2-D, hand drawn animation to tell a powerful and emotional story. The plot moves along at a very good pace yet there's still room for plenty of character development; and the decisions of which actor or actress should voice which part on screen were thoughtfully made. Indeed, this movie grabs your attention right away and it never lets go until the final frame--this is all THAT good. The music by Randy Newman and others is excellent; and when the actors voicing the characters sing, they sing flawlessly, too.<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet rather young childhood friends Charlotte (voiced by Breanna Brooks) and Tiana (voiced by Elizabeth M. Dampier) nearly spellbound as they listen once again to Tiana's seamstress mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) tell the story of how a frog was turned into a handsome prince when a young woman kissed it. Charlotte, who comes from wealth, wants to make that fantasy a reality while Tiana chooses the more traditional route of hard work to get ahead, a choice practically made for her since she comes from a poor African-American family in New Orleans where this all takes place. However, Tiana learns the importance of love through her parents; money isn't everything. Tiana also wants to open her own restaurant just like her father always wanted to but never had the money to actually do.<br /><br />And there's more to the plot that I can tell you without giving too much away! One year as Mari Gras approaches, Prince Naveen of Maldonia (voiced by Bruno Campos) comes to New Orleans with his personal assistant Lawrence (voiced by Peter Bartlett). Prince Naveen is soon tricked into becoming a frog by the evil Dr. Facilier (voiced by Keith David) who wants to keep the Prince a frog so that he can have a grown up Charlotte (now voiced by Jennifer Cody) marry Lawrence who is magically made to look like the Prince--and then Dr. Facilier can control all of New Orleans with his buddies \\"from the other side.\\"<br /><br />Add to this a huge New Orleans party thrown by Charlotte's \\"Big Daddy\\" (voiced by John Goodman); a trumpet playing crocodile named Louis (voiced by Michael-Leon Wooley); a Cajun firefly named Ray (voiced by Jim Cummings) and an elderly blind woman named Mama Odie (voiced by Jenifer Lewis) who weaves magical spells to do good from her home in the bayou and you've got one heck of a movie. There's plenty of suspense, too! Will Charlotte be fooled into marrying Lawrence? What happens when the grown up Tiana (now voiced by Anika Noni Rose) kisses Prince Naveen after he's turned into a frog by Dr. Facilier? Will Tiana and Prince Naveen ever achieve happiness when up against Dr. Facilier and his evil buddies--and how could they do it as mere frogs? No spoilers here--watch and find out!<br /><br />The DVD comes with deleted scenes; and I also liked the music video for \\"Never Knew I Needed,\\" one of the major songs in the film performed by Ne-Yo.<br /><br />The Princess and the Frog is a remarkable comeback for traditional animation at Disney and that's grand. This is a story with characters that are real--even the good people have their flaws and no one is portrayed as perfect. I highly recommend this movie as a fine family film although I must admit that there are a small number of scenes that could be somewhat scary for very young children. In addition, fans of Disney movies and animation in general would do well to add this to their collections.r.

1416550550|5.0|\\"The Forgotten Garden\\" by Kate Morton is a great book, weaving from past to present. A little girl, Nell,  is abandoned on a ship in 1913 with only a small suitcase. A man, Hugh, finds her on the ship, takes her in, and raises her with his wife. The girl is never told of her origins until her 21st birthday. After finding out, she withdraws from the family and sets out on a search to find her real family. Later on, it is not her but her granddaughter, Cassandra, that unravels the mystery that was left after her death.<br /><br />This book is a thick book, 545 pages, but its probably one of the best books I have read in a long time. It made me laugh, cry, and laugh again. With every turn of the page comes friendship, love, heart break, and betrayal. Once you start reading this book, it's hard to put down. Bravo Kate Morton!

B001W63DY6|5.0|This BLU-RAY disc has some of the best audio you will ever hear, Streisand is in fine voice, though not her very best, still it's very enjoyable, her talking to the audience has captured me, I have some of her recordings, but was never a big fan, at least not until I bought this disc, got to love the whole experience, masterfully recorded, both audio and video, one of the best pop concerts ever, enjoy
B0039UTDA6|5.0|Unbelievable video footage that is complimented by the narrator.  Interesting information.  Well worth repeated viewing.  Only criticism I would have is there is some repetition.  Otherwise, fantastic.  My four-year-old son loves watching this constantly.
0312382464|5.0|A wonderful book that you won't be able to put down.  Beautifully researched as always and a terrific story that gives you the sense of being there.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|A slow beginning with too many Swedish names of people places and things.  Picks up speed and then slows down to a predictable conclusion.  One weakness of Larsson's is romantic sceens.  Given the promiscuity of Blomkwist. imagine how stimulating the book could have been.
0743497465|5.0|Dan Brown is truly one of America's greatest living writers.  He is meticulous in his research and when he weaves his mysterious trail telling you a story you feel you are right there with the characters encountering all of the amazing dilemmas that Dan Brown comes up with.  It's hard to put a Dan Brown book down.

031237593X|5.0|One of my very favorite Penman books, well researched and well written.  She brings true logic to the oft told tale of Richard III I can see why the Richard III Society had her come to give a lecture.  She writes the truth based on research and well founded logic.  This is a must read for every one who loves Medieval Historical Mysteries.
B000FC12Z0|3.0|When I download a free text for my Kindle, and I encounter a typo, I understand that it was proofread by volunteers, and that it's all part of the deal. But I paid for this book, and the number of typos in it was astounding. The most common error I found was in spacing -- words run together -- but I also found errors in punctuation. There was one place where the first half of a sentence was missing altogether.    The publishers would not, presumably, put up with this kind of sloppy editing in a print version. What makes them think it's OK to put out an electronic version with this many errors?
0312944926|5.0|What an incredible story, well researched as usual for Mr. Brown and very today with a computer program that will make your hair stand on edge.  Mr. Brown takes us down a very adventurous and frightening trail, you'll truly enjoy this one.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I bought this to use with my laptop for mapping software. While I have not done any benchmark comparisons, the BU-353 seems to be more sensitive than other GPS receivers I have used, including those built-in to devices like cellphones and dedicated GPS receivers. The suction cup let's you place it where it will get the best signal, and it is very simple to setup with most software I have used it with.<br /><br />I have not found any drawbacks with this device. Great price, performs well, I recommend it.

I had to open it to find out it did not work.
B003J7HOKU|5.0|And probably eat their souls along with yours. This album is nuts. Other reviewers have gone into detail and said it better than I can, but I do have to say it's slower, heavier, and darker than their other albums. I agree with what others have said about production. I prefer the sound of Horizons and Killing with a Smile for these guys. Deep Blue is too bass-heavy and doesn't do enough justice to the guitars. If you have a sub in your car, this album will be an assault of bass drum with faint guitars and vocals you can't hear over the pounding. Not good in the car. (I have the same problem with all of Tool's albums.) In your home, it sounds amazing. Crank it up and scare the neighbors.
0316098337|4.0|This is the kind of book that is better the less you know about it.<br /><br />Even the product description above, and probably most of the reviews here will give you more information than you need to know.<br /><br />So this review won't tell you much about this book.  What I can tell you is that it lives up to the hype.  It's a poignant, thoughtful, and completely original book.<br /><br />What makes it original? -- the way of looking at the world, the use of a smart, face-value 5-year-old narrator.<br /><br />What makes it poignant and thoughtful? -- the theme of how deep a mother's love goes, how motherhood is instinctive, how a 5-year-old looks at the world.<br /><br />4 stars ++
0142410314|3.0|My memories of Charlie are from the movies. I never read the book, but the movies do add things as movies will do and now I understand the differences arising between the two Chocolate Factory movies. The directors had to add some sort of conflict. Dahl's story is like this: Charlie is poor; Charlie gets golden ticket; Charlie is virtuous where the other children are bad; Charlie is awarded factory by Wonka.<br /><br />In this, the original story, everything plays out nicely and everything is too simple. Charlie is poor but his family is entirely good. All the others we see are horrible and one-dimensional and their defining traits become the mode for their downfall. But if you're poor you can be good just by keeping your head down and good things will happen to you. I was dismayed to learn that Charlie and his grandpa avoided the Fizzy Lifting Drink and avoided any complexity to their characters as is in the version I cherished.<br /><br />Wonka is an entirely wonderful and novel creation, and I understand why such talented actors wanted to fill his shoes. However, he is not a hero of the working class. Expelling all your workers as a way to avoid corporate espionage is bad enough, but enslaving a whole race of people as your personal worker-army is a little much. I would hope that the Salts or the Gloops or one of the other families enlighten the government as to the conditions at the factory. Also: Wonka has a beard.<br /><br />In the end, reading the book for beloved stories like this always create more perspective. Dahl is a talented writer but this creation is written for a different audience than me. In that respects, I feel it is an effective text. For me however, it works in concert with the creative efforts spawned by it to forge a synthetic idea of just Who Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket really are. I am glad I read it.
B000286S8S|5.0|This is a great collection of songs to those unfamiliar with Van halen and even to those who have all of their albums. the remaster sound is wonderful (with the exception of (oh) pretty woman. the version on Diver Down (remastered) is a lot clearer). I would recommend this collection to all van halen fans new and old. I am, however, disappointed that Van Halen III with Gary Charone is not represented here as that was a good and very underrated album. The glitch on track 6 of disc 1 is simply they forgot to fade it out at the end. Otherwise a very good album altogether.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I will NOT lie...I did NOT watch the FULL movie.  I didn't even watch HALFWAY through the movie.  It was SOOOO boring and SOOO dumb, I couldn't sit through ONE MORE MINUTE of it after 20 min. of viewing.    I was expecting a REAL movie, not shaking-unsteady cameras and two \\"dummies\\" making a \\"home-video.\\"  It is NOT a movie, but documentary-format.  I thought Blair Witch Project was a \\"dud,\\" but I sat through the WHOLE movie and even talked about it for a couple days afterwards.  Paranormal Activity does NOT engage the viewer AT ALL in the first 20 minutes....    Kudos to those who sat through it and got the heeby-jeebies (as they say) but I just COULDN'T tolerate it beyond 20 min. of PURE STUPIDITY!    If you DON'T like movies that seem like an amateur taking a  \\"HOME VIDEO,\\" like the \\"Blair Witch Project,\\" this movie is JUST THAT!  Don't expect the movie-style to be like \\"Psycho\\" or \\"Halloween.\\"  There is NO plot, NO story...just two amateurs making a HOME VIDEO.
1439153663|1.0|I could not get past the first 50 pages of this book.  The story may be interesting, but the writing is so poor that it distracts from all else.  I had just finished reading \\"Cutting for Stone\\" by Verghese, which was so beautifully written that this was just painful in comparison.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|As some have said previously, the film starts out good but as the story unravels it becomes pretty absurd.  Despite that, it's a good thriller that had me on edge right up to the end.  Not to mention the obvious eye candy of Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler!!
B0009SOFFY|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made, as everybody with half a brain knows, and as you can see from the reviews here, but what needs more stress is how great this remaster is.  The original was terrible--underwater almost.  You know how good the band is but you can't really hear it; listening to the old version, you sort of reconstruct in your head what it must've really sounded like.  But this, this is raw, you're in the studio.  This could be the best digital remaster I've heard--the one with the biggest difference.  Everything cuts.  When I put it on my ipod (do it uncompressed, for the love of God, why else did you buy the 160G drive?), I forgot to replace the old version, so i-tunes put the songs next to each other, old version of each song, then new.  Heard that way, the difference was unbelievable.  The reviewer who said s/he couldn't tell the difference is crazy.  Forget the extra cd, which has a lot of good stuff by the way; this is worth it for the remaster.<br /><br />As for the music itself, the only thing to add to the other reviews, is how influenced by free jazz this record is, how they managed to combine hard rock and free jazz riffs (Ornette Coleman bleats really) but retaining the hardness and sharpness, that is, it's still their thing.
B002XTBE6K|2.0|I scanned some of the good reviews of this adaptation, saw the 4.5 star rating, and borrowed a copy, having watched most of Jane Austen's adaptations and still wanting more.  Excited with what I thought would be 4 episodes of Emma and much of the book covered, since the last two I saw were movie-length.    Unfortunately, this was very much a disappointment.  Emma and Mr Knightley as played by the leads in this adaptation are not what Ms Austen described in her book.  Nor are the smaller roles true to the book.  Emma here is so not elegant and so not charming and capable.  Mr Knightley lacks command.  Jane Fairfax fails to appear reserved and beautiful and accomplished.  Miss Bates is too subdued.  Mr Woodhouse's funny eccentricities are not coming across.    And so much liberty was taken with the dialogue and story that from the first scene of this adaptation I was open-mouthed at what they had done to it.  Sometimes certain scenes or plotlines have to be adapted to suit the screen, but here the changes and additions were numerous, made no sense nor improved the original story.  Also, the language in the book may not be modern, but this is a period drama, was there a need to do away with Ms Austen's charming dialogue?  I wonder if the screenwriter is familiar with Jane Austen at all??    If you don't care about all that, this is a pretty series, the scenery and colours are nice to look at, the soundtrack is pleasing, some may even think Emma looks pretty (not me though).  But if you are a Jane Austen or Emma fan, don't just glance at the top reviews, read the one and two-star reviews first before purchasing this.  I infinitely prefer elegant Gwyneth Paltrow's or spirited Kate Beckinsale's Emma.    To finally have a new BBC series of Emma and have this as a result... I hate to think how many years more I have to wait for a good version to be produced.  I am glad I managed to watch this before purchasing a copy.  I would not want this in my collection.
1416562605|4.0|Haven't been to India, but if even some of this is true, it's a good, wary view of a democracy...and perhaps of what can happen to \\"new\\" democracies that we Imperialists try to set up.  Funny, at the very least, but also scary in its presentation of the \\"real\\" India.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|The beginning scenes when they have the interviews with MJ's dancers and the very end are very touching and sad but everything else just pumps you up.  When I watch this, it always makes me get up and dance.  I've bought so many other DVD's that were a waste of money and I regret buying since I only watch it once and that's it, but this one - I'm really glad that I bought it.  Some of my friends complained that all this movie had was MJ dancing and singing and that it was boring because of that. . . When I heard them say that, besides thinking in my mind how foolish of a comment that was, if anything that made me feel simply sorry for them that they felt that way.  Some folks just don't understand what kind of influence MJ had to myself and a lot of other people out there.   This is worth watching over and over.  I love you MJ, you are one of my inspirations and you will forever be alive in our hearts.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Two of my favorite singer/songwriers together again!. The energy from the audience enhances their performances. Most of my favorites songs are sung, some with beautiful duets. It was great to hear Carol again after all these years and with the same voice! I listen to it over and over.
B0016MJ6T2|4.0|Party Monster is definitely a great movie for entertainment value. MaCaulay Culkin was a good choice to play Michael Alig, but he does exagerate his matterisms a bit (but I guess that's Hollywood). He actually resembles Richie Rich (another club kid), more than he resembles Michael. Seth Green was an interesting choice for James St. James, but he pulled off the role oddly well. Marilyn Manson plays Christina, which is quite hilarious.<br />I keep in touch with Michael Alig the best that I can. He has never seen this movie, so he cannot assess it's validity. If you really want to know the real Michael Alig, watch Party Monster: The Documentary. Still interested in Michael? He's working on an autobiography while he's still locked up.<br /><br />Overall, good movie, I would recommend it, but remember, this is not a documentary, it's just based on a true story.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Indiana Jones, so looked forward immensely to this installment.  Boy, what I disappointed.  The story itself was pretty good--introducing Indy's son, old love, etc. was good.  I even (in some ways) liked the sci-fi nature of the story . . . the first movies were set during the '30s and '40s, when movies were about adventure and fighting the Nazis and such; this one is set in the '50s, when movies were all about sci-fi and alien invasions/contact, so it fit.    That being said, the digital effects got annoying.  They were fine for the alien portions, but were poorly done & inappropriate for the action sequences.  Part of the appeal of the earlier films was the ACTUAL stunt work and action sequences.  If I wanted to see digitally rendered vehicles in a chase I'd watch Pixar's Cars.  And I hate to say it, but Harrison was completely unconvincing in many of the action scenes.  Watching him attempt the physical feats that Indy is (supposedly) still capable of performing in his 60s was just embarrassing.  Even Indy ages, and the film-makers would have been better off reflecting this fact.  Instead, they chose to pretend he hadn't lost a step since his 30s, and Harrison has definitely lost a lot more than Indy probably would have.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|After reading great reviews in People and Entertainment Weekly, I couldn't wait to get this book.  The premise reminded me of the movie Same Time Next Year, but it turned out not to be that way at all.  I couldn't wait to get home every night to see what happened next to Dex and Em.

0756405890|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I read it for the first time last year. Here is my previous review:<br /><br />\\"When it comes to fantasy I can easily get wrapped up in a good story and love visiting the imaginatively detailed worlds, but I'm not too well-read within the genre. So I approach Patrick Rothfuss's debut novel, The Name of the Wind, as kind of an outsider. The verdict: Give it enough time and you will love it!<br /><br />\\"The story is a slow boil. I was lost until about page 50, and I didn't really get hooked until after 150 pages. Once I passed the 200 page mark I finished the last 500 in 4 days. The story of Kvothe (pronounced sort of like \\"Quothe\\") is the story of a legend, but you'll be constantly surprised uncovering the differences between legend and fact. The world created, loosely known as the four corners of civilization, is entirely believable and equally full of beauty, wonder, grit and danger.<br /><br />\\"This book is part one of a trilogy and the next installment is due out in March 2011. It's marked on my calendar.\\"<br /><br />After putting the book down, I looked ahead to the release of the second book, The Wise Man's Fear, and I even followed the author's blog. What completely surprised me was how much this story excited my imagination. I found myself revisiting Kvothe's world over and over again in my mind. I cannot recommend The Name of the Wind enough.

B000001C6M|5.0|Slayer slays, including this album. Regardless many years since its release it is still kicking butt. Great album.
B003CR9BYE|4.0|Two of the finest recordings Sinatra ever made, in the eyes of many collectors, are the cuts of Dindi and Song of the Sabia in the Jobim sessions. One, Dindi, appeared in the first Jobim album, and was immediately recognized as a classic. The other, Sabia, was never released, and was available only as a bootleg among collectors. A mystery is why it was not included in the 2nd partial Jobim album, Sinatra and Company. The relaxed Bossa Nova style suited Sinatra to a tee in this phase of his career--not too demanding vocally--allowing him to focus on his great talent for expression. That he was also in good voice for these sessions--not always the case in the Reprise period--is also a plus. That both songs are included in this album makes it worthwhile to own. Plus Ogerman's splendid arrangements--in my view probably the best, with Riddle, of the Reprise period.
B00001OH7Y|3.0|`Scary Monsters' is considered Bowie's last great album and I am probably on an island here but I don't get the adulation. It is good but I guess I am not really a Bowie fan because I will probably play it less as the years go by. It was definitely his most commercial record in five years and spawned several hit singles (which are by far the best songs on the LP by the way) but commercial British new wave could be my least favorite music so I'm not a fan. \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" is a great song as are \\"Fashion\\" and the title track but after that..maybe \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" but that's it for me. I do like \\"It's No Game, part 2\\" but not the first part so much. I would definitely agree that `Scary Monsters' is less pandering to a mass audience than any of his `80's output and which is good. Again if you are fan of the music of this era or of Bowie in particular than you will like this record but if your tastes are more `Ziggy' or `Aladdin Sane' then you won't like `Scary Monsters' as much.

B00003CXC7|4.0|This 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic was nominated for four Academy awards.  I remember seeing it years ago and loving it.  Seeing it again, I'm reminded of the way things used to be, and it is certainly worthwhile as a retro experience.  It's interesting to see the clothing styles and the dial telephones.  There's also a mystery that kept me interested.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is cast in the role of a photographer with a broken leg.  He's confined to his apartment which is supposed to be in New York's Greenwich village.  From his window, he observes his neighbors.  And the apartment house across the street just happens to be designed in a way that he can look into the windows of all the apartments and get a bird's eye view into the lives other people's lives.  Every day a nurse, played by Thelma Ritter, comes to look in on him.  She shares his interest in his neighbors and she counsels him about his love life.  It seems his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly, wants to marry him but he holds back because she is a society girl and he doubts if she can fit into his life of international travel to a wide variety of war-torn and isolated places.  But as the film progresses, she gets more and more involved in what he suspects is a murder in the apartment across the courtyard.  She's beautiful, of course, with an unnaturally tiny waistline which was the style in those days, and she plays her part well.  Raymond Burr is cast in the role of the supposed murderer.  Did he or did he not kill his wife?  This is the storyline that keeps the audience guessing.<br /><br />The plot moves swiftly and it certainly captured my interest.  And Hitchcock had a way of capturing suspense that is unique.  It is successful as a film in most ways.  But it's 2010 now I'm a bit jaded.  That why, in spite of my giving this film a high recommendation, I'm not exactly sure that it has stood the test of time.
0525948023|5.0|... have missed the point entirely.  My father has long been interested in Buddhist philosophy and this book was a timely Christmas from him.  Currently he is involved in a global cooperative effort to translate some of the original Lotus Sutras into more meaningful and appropriate form for the current era than the rather stilted efforts that have been previously available, and while I can say that certainly the path to this books existence is certainly having roots in that philosophy, in no way is this book a re-packaging of it nor does it purport to be.  It is a bit of insight and wisdom that is shared in a manner that may make sense to those who are of mind, that is all.      Personally, I found this book to be a marvelous revelation.  I did not find this book to be a proclamation of anything. Although it may be true that the author found his way to what is presented here through Buddhist philosophy, I found that the expression of the insight was far simpler and more practically based in psychology.  This has been a very neat encapsulation of much of the complex riddling that is unfortunately the form that most Buddhist ideas are expressed in.  There is limitation in labeling, and that idea is one of the first that Tolle tackle's in the book. Our limitation for perception of anything beyond its definition is unfortunate.  The problem with  particularly anything that hints at representing a philosophy or religion, is the fact that it is likely to be rejected by countless as soon as it might fall into such a category for reasons of being either appropriately or inappropriately so.     As one who has found much truth in the way of Buddhist philosophy (quite by accident) and much to aspire to in the way of the Christian doctrine (quite to my own surprise) as I search for a meaningful path in my life to work towards, I found that this book helped bring some focus to my efforts in a way that was most welcome.  This book in no way claims to be an authoritative Buddhistdoctrine nor does it purport to hold the secrets of the universe by leading the way to enlightenment.  What it does do is neatly point out some of the failings in human nature and society to address a history of self-destructive behavior as individuals and as a community, and a potential way around perpetuating that destructive behavior.  That way begins by bringing conscious awareness of reactive behavior, being able to recognize it for what it is, and therefore allowing us to act according to a more accurate perception of our surroundings.  The concepts he presented allowed me to see more clearly much like my eyeglasses do without the strenuous mental gymnastics required to decipher the message like some other presentations of such concept.    The author states immediately that the book is not \\"interesting\\" in the traditional sense of being able to talk about it and agree or disagree with what is put forth, saying simply that it \\"will either be meaningful to you or it will not.\\"  That being said, it can be found for purchase at a non-prohibitive price of 99 cents, and doesn't cost much more in terms of time and effort to read as it is presented in straightforward simple language in a very concise length - especially when considering the breadth of concepts he presents.  With such minimal cost to the reader both financially and in time necessary to invest in reading, I cannot see how one could recommend passing it up since the potential benefit far outweighs the potential cost even should one decide that the book didn't add any value to your life by the time you have finished reading.  I did it in the relaxed moments while languishing in the bath a few bits at a time until I was through, essentially losing nothing in terms of time invested since I otherwise would have been reading the daily comics.    In sum, this book is an easy and quick read that I would highly recommend to those in a position of uncertainty as well as to those who are certain of their path.  Ifyou are considering it at all, I say its at least worth the risk of wasted time. Reading it certainly can't hurt, and can potentially be of great value as it was to me.
B003MX5P20|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Enrique Iglesias English albums very much, but I was a bit skeptical about this album due to the different direction Enrique took with all the collaborators. After I listened to the album I liked it, but it wasn't until I purchased the deluxe edition on iTunes (also sold at Target) that I really enjoyed  it. The deluxe edition comes with three extra english tracks Why Not Me, Heartbreaker, and Coming Home. All the tracks are in a different order on the deluxe edition and to me the album flows so much better. To me these three songs on the deluxe edition are some of the better songs on the album. I wonder why this deluxe album was not released instead of this regular edition. I think people will enjoy the order of these songs on this edition better. My favorite songs are Why Not Me, I Like It, Coming Home, Heartbeat, Heartbreaker, Ayer,  Dile Que, and One Day At a Time. I highly encourage anyone who is considering getting this album to go with the deluxe edition (sold only on itunes or Target) of Euphoria due to the three bonus english tracks and the much better order of the tracks.

0061122416|5.0|This fable is about an Andalusian shepherd who has a dream about finding a treasure at the Great Pyramids in Egypt and his desire and struggles to find that treasure.<br /><br />After reading the many varied reviews on this book, here is what I have to say:<br /><br />If you don't get anything out of this story, that simply means you're not yet ready for what it has to say.  Give it a few years and try it again.  The story is deceptively simple and makes it very easy and quick to read, but the message it delivers is OVERWHELMINGLY complex.  For this very reason I find the storytelling ability of Paulo Coelho absolutely extraordinary!<br /><br />Ultimately the message is to remember the dream you once had but for whatever reason gave up and to continue to go after it, despite the many inevitable obstacles and challenges that will occur during your mission to achieve your dreams.  This dream is referred to as one's \\"personal legend.\\"  There is also an underlying spiritual/religious tone to the story, but that is not immediately obvious.<br /><br />I must admit, I've read this book nearly three weeks ago and have read several books since then, yet the story and its message still speaks to me and has stayed with me.  After reading it, I immediately recommended it to my best friend of over 20 years who, in recent months, gave up her life in California to travel the world for a year.  Funnily enough she emailed me back to let me know she had, in fact, read the book a number of years ago (in her early 20's) and when she finished reading it she thought to herself, \\"What in the hell did I just read?\\" and thought she wasted her time.  I wrote back and responded that if she gave it one more try that she would be ready for the message as her current travels reflect the story's very message.  She let me know that she smiled in understanding when she read what I had to say and that she eagerly awaits reading the book again!

030726999X|5.0|I just finished reading the third book in the Millennium series and I wasn't disappointed and you won't be either!  If you enjoyed Dragon Tattoo or Played with Fire, you're certain to enjoy the final book and the conclusion to a lot of the loose ends in The Girl Who Played with Fire.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander spends the majority of the book lying in a hospital bed, which to me was maddening.  In the first two books I enjoyed Salander's wild and daredevil antics, but in this book I had to be more patient to get the read about Salander's cunning.  There are so many characters to keep up with that it can be a bit confusing at times.  True to form, Larsson continues to switch between characters very rapidly and each chapter is limited to a few days making the pace seem rapid fire.  I personally enjoy this style because it makes for fast reading, despite the 500+ pages of the book.<br /><br />I do not recommend reading this book without having at least read The Girl Who Played With Fire (book 2) first.  Oftentimes you will read a sequel that can be read on its own without any understanding of its prequel, and while Larsson does a simple expalanation of certain characters and situations that crop up in this book, I don't think the simple explanations do the whole story justice.  So do yourself a favor and read each book in sequence.<br /><br />The story is absolutely satisfying and I highly recommend it along with the others in the series!

0143118420|5.0|This is my first review on Amazon. I just had to do it after seeing so many negative comments.   I absolutely love the book. I have an audio version read by the author.  I don't think the book is provocative or narcissistic.   This is a sincere story full of emotions, thoughts and self analysis (yes, and it makes it very realistic.)    This book is about spiritual journey, search for balance and happiness.   If you are not interested in the subject than this book is probably not for you. If you are satisfied with your life and don't understand people who are searching for something more (and I don't mean material things) - this book may not be for you either.  Elizabeth Gilbert is an excellent writer. I also absolutely love listening to her reading the book.

B001HN694K|4.0|\\"Alice\\" has a bit of a slow start, and to any viewer not familiar with the story, it can be confusing for awhile. Yet it wins a person over, voice by voice, visual by visual, and step-by-Depp. Johnny continues to amaze me with his versatility as an actor. He has become one of those guys who makes anything he is in better, even if he can't save them all (like Michael Caine in that respect.) Director Burton has filled the cast with great British character actor vocalizations, and the screen with oddball colors and drawings that amuse, frighten or delight. I think the best way to enjoy his version of \\"Alice\\" is to see the Disney animated 1950's effort first, which is great, and then the new twist on the story. If a mom or dad could read the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" to the kids and explain a bit about Lewis Carroll, the author, first, so much the better. Burton does assume a certain literacy and familiarity with the tale and the poem that may give contemporary kids too much credit, but he has done a good job overall. If watching this version of \\"Alice\\" leads some young folk to read the original prose, hurrah!
B000MKXEME|5.0|The most fun to be had enjoying a horror movie, period. Jeffery Combs at his ultimate best. Everything about the movie is amazing. It is a great classic to be enjoyed again and again.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I admit, I am not usually a fan of Meyer's writing, but the book for this film was quite good. I own the other two films, while preferring the plot of New Moon to the 1st film.  I don't feel, even in the books, Edward gets developed well until at least Eclipse. Bella's \\"addiction\\" (as Jacob refers to it) fails to make any sense, given how little she knows Edward. Anyway, I loved the action sequences in this film; I would have liked more of them.  It seems the best action sequences were in the trailer ads for the film. Personally, I view Victoria's hold over Riley in the book as seductive or sexual. Bryce Dallas Howard can't DO seductive, so her character's hold on Riley in the film is inexplicable. Rochelle was much better as Victoria. I also wish that Warner Brothers, who also went cheap with Harry Potter after the first few films, would advance the money for them to rehire Carter Burwell for the music. He set mood beautifully in the first film. All the composers, though well-known for composing other film soundtracks, hired since Burwell are mediocre for this series. That really handicaps the films for me.
0385737424|5.0|This is the reigning Newbery Award winner, I FINALLY read this book... in one day. It was awesome. I can totally see why it won the golden Newbery medal. Miranda's mother is practicing to be a contestant on The $20,000 Pyramid... you know, that show where a celebrity describes words and you have to guess them, and then vice versa, and in the end they go into the winners circle and the celeb has to list things in a category, and you need to correctly guess the six categories? So the chapter titles are mostly categories. Things That Are Hidden. Things In An Elevator. And in the end Miranda's mother actually gets to be on the show.    There are all the usual things - the seemingly minor characters that end up coming into the story in bigger ways, the mystery that becomes obvious, the main character's favorite book that ends up being important to the plot... and of course (kinda giving something away here but not too crucial to the plot), the girl Miranda thinks hates her for years, who it turns out thinks MIRANDA hated HER first! People are not always what they seem at first, and it's fun figuring it out. Plus, whose life is she supposed to help save? That part kept me guessing til it came to that moment.    So before I give away anything else, let me just say that this is a great book, and you should read it. Children's books are great, and even though parts of this were predictable, there was a lot more to it than that and it's worth a read.
B003JSU2NU|3.0|I agree with Lauren \\"Miss Novel\\" in her comments. Carter Burwell's themes for the first film are now \\"signature\\" pieces; you think of Twilight films, you think of either \\"Bella' Lullaby\\" or the initial deer chasing theme. Neither New Moon nor Eclipse can say the same. I guess many fans like \\"The Meadow\\" from New Moon, but the rest of the film LIKE this soundtrack, is just a string of potential pop 40 hits by various artists. In this film, Eclipse, the only memorable piece by Shore is \\"Jacob's Theme\\", and it hardly runs through the film. There is no single theme holding this film together. I was NOT impressed.

B002ZG97E2|5.0|I had seen the various teaser trailers for \\"Despicable Me\\" and it looked okay, but it was not until I saw the trailer that suddenly introduced three little girls into the mix that I was actually interested in going to catch this in the theater instead of waiting for the DVD.  The little yellow minions were certainly cute enough, but it was the whole idea of how the character of Gru, a nefarious villain who is plotting to steal the money, ends up having to take care of those three little girls that got me interested.  After all, these are computer animated little girls, which means they have those great big eyes.  Well, in turns out, that Gru has hatched up his evil plan to steal the moon because the villain down the street, Vector, has been stealing Gru's thunder (well, actually, Vector stole a pretty big landmark).  The three little girls, who live in a local for-profit orphanage, have been going door to door selling cookies.  Gru turned them away, but Vector loves cookies, which gives Gru an idea that involves the girls and cookie-robots for this wacky new moon race.<br /><br />One of the things I found impressive about this movie is that Gru's voice never really sounded like Steve Carell, and the same can be said for Julie Andrews as his mom or Kristen Wiig as Miss Hattie.  An animated film where the voices do not conjure up the actual actors and actresses is rather refreshing.  But the voices are really secondary to the main strength of the movie, which is that it is pretty much non-stop comic cuteness.  I loved the fact that each of the minions has his own name, even if I could not remember the names or really tell any of the minions apart, and it was nice to see that the two-eyed and one-eyed minions all got along with each other in complete and utter minion harmony.  This is one of those madcap movies that throws little jokes and gags in at pretty much any opportunity.  Meanwhile, the closer Gru gets to his goal of stealing the moon, the more it becomes obvious to us that the bad guy is having his heart stolen.  I had my expectations of how it would play out, and all of my guesses turned out to be wrong, and most of what directors Chris Renaud (the Oscar nominated short \\"[[ASIN:B000NU2TJW No Time For Nuts]]\\") and Pierre Coffin (the U.K animated short \\"Gary's Fall\\") came up with was better.  I laughed and I cried, which is pretty much as good as it gets at the movies.<br /><br />This was my first movie in digital 3D and to my surprise I survived the experience without having my head blow up like it does when I see totally hand-held camera movies like \\"[[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]].\\"  The only downside was going out in the bright sunlight after wearing \\"dark\\" glasses for a couple of hours.  On the one hand I have nothing specific to which I can compare my digital 3D experience, but it was nice to actual enjoy thinking that objects were about to hit my nose as opposed to seeing a 3D move in 2D like \\"[[ASIN:B001OQCVH4 My Bloody Valentine 3D]]\\" and being annoyed anytime a patently obvious 3D gimmick pops up on screen.  I guess I find the visual tricks a lot more fun in an animated film than in a horror flick.  I might be willing to try a non-animated digital 3D movie next, although those all seem to be CGI dominated films, but I guess that is to be expected.  Apparently they can turn anything into digital 3D, but I am not sure if I am ready for the technology to be applied to \\"Gone with Wind,\\" \\"Casablanca,\\" and \\"Citizen Kane,\\" although it cannot possibly be as bad as colorization.  Anyhow, I liked the 3D experience way more than I had anticipated and for the rest of you that went gaga over \\"Avatar\\" or \\"Toy Story 3\\" in 3D, all I can say is that my sense of wonder this time around probably made me bump the rating up higher than I might have if I had seen the movie in 2D, but it was definitely a key part of my wonderful experience today.that the bad guy is having his heart stolen.

At age 19 he moved to London where he graduated from London's University in psychology and writing. In his search for self he changed his name to Eckhart after Meister Eckhart, the 14th century German theologian and Christian of the Domenican order [[ASIN:006130008X Meister Eckhart: The celebrated 14th Century mystic and scholastic: A central source and inspiration of dominant currents in philosophy and theology since Aquinas, w/the text of his historic Defense]].

However, in the DVD case it announces that it has among others, spanish subtitles, which it doesn´t.    I don´t know if in all your korean copies of the movie (which in this case it is)the information is the same, but watch out, because if a non-english speaking customer buys it because it assures it has spanish subtitles, he/she will recieve a really unpleasent surprise.

6305882592|5.0|This is one of those rare films that teaches a lesson without being didactic, that pulls on your heart strings without being sappy, and that is above else a really unique, entertaining and engaging story.    The film is about a teenage boy obsessed with death-- or so he thinks. What his relationship with Maude teaches him is that he actually just hasn't figured out how to enjoy life. Maude is someone who has been through much worse than Harold has seen, and because of this understands happiness as fully as she understands pain.     This film is as daring as it is touching. Yet, it is never daring or edgy in spite of the script. Despite how strange or unexpected things get, it all fits together perfectly in a wonderfully told, wonderfully paced, and very funny story in which each scene packs both entertainment and meaning.    It doesn't hurt that the soundtrack is entirely Cat Stevens...    As far as this DVD goes, there are no extra features besides a trailer so if that's your thing you might want to find another copy if it exists. 5 stars for Harold and Maude being a truly great film worth adding to any collection.

I could appreciate the beauty of China, from it's brightly colored market places to the weathered old man smoking a pipe.

It could easily have turned into one of those films I re-rent every couple of years or so, but I'm buying a copy instead,  in large measure because of this Tom Ford comment on the \\"making of\\" extra:  He said \\"If I can get the audience to leave the theater and think 'Wow! I need to pay more attention to my day, because this is all I get!' then I think the film will have meant something.\\"  I've decided that what that means for me is that  I need Ford's movie available to snap me back to attention whenever needed. Which I suspect will be far too often.

1594488843|2.0|This book was disappointing for me as I had high hopes before reading it.  While there are a few interesting ideas presented here about motivation (that carrot/stick rewards can actually reduce intrinsic motivation), Daniel Pink has taken old findings, repackaged them into sound bites and supported them with selective evidence.  The logical  inconsistencies in the book made it harder for me to focus on the useful content (e.g. - his main argument is that we are currently participating in \\"Motivation 2.0\\" which is broken and needs to change - yet all the examples of \\"Motivation 3.0\\" are from current, or even not so current, workplaces or experiences that supposedly shouldn't already know about it).  Pages 147-215 are a \\"toolkit\\" which reads to me like a co-marketing arrangement or Mr. Pink's outline of the book before he wrote it.  The book could be slimmed down to 25 meaningful pages without difficulty.    Take the good ideas from this book and run with them, but don't expect much intellectual rigor or real new ideas from this book.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|Thank you for sending me the DVD.... I love that movie and it goes with my 80's collection of movies....
B002VECMAE|1.0|The cast was great, however, it was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.  My husband and I were very disappointed.  When the film was over, we were left saying 'huh?\\"  Weird, weird, weird.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|A  nice change from typical TV and its brought back the musical in a sense.  Glee touches on all types of discriminations without focusing too much on the high school model.  In fact, the teachers are some of the best supporting characters, especially Sue Sylvester (who sometimes steals the show) a la Jane Lynch who first stood out for me in ROLE MODELS.  The creators tapped into Broadway stars to pull this one off and it worked.  The nice thing about the songs is that they don't stick to one decade.  In fact, they cover songs that all generations can remember them even if they're all updated.  This is arguably one of the hottest TV shows in several years and the visiting A list actors and actresses supports my stance.  MY GRADE: A minus to A.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I highly enjoyed this film only because I expected something slightly different but still within the realm of science fiction.  After watching the film in its entirely, I was left with the impression that science fiction has taken a fresh, bold and political turn.  The opening scenes, with its documentary style filming, shows how the world would react to the arrival of extra-terrestrials.  As a person who watches documentaries, I love such \\"mockumentary\\".  With this film, science fiction is no longer limited to cheap escapism and the usual stereotypes of extra-terrestrials as being either benevolent (Spielberg's E.T.)or monstrous (Cameron's Aliens).  The aliens in this film do not come to either enlighten or destroy humanity.  They are simply proletarian-class refugees from outer space, and they, combined with their very \\"alien\\" appearance, draw an obvious analogy to the current problem of refugees and illegal immigration that is just going to get worse as rich countries get richer while poor countries get poorer.  This bold science fiction film is not afraid of being overtly political and drawing attention to a serious global issue, while continuing to use the same special effects, costumes, gadgets, futuristic weapons, space ships and action scenes that one normally finds in a science fiction movie.  Drawing further audience attention to the government use of private military contractors (PMC) is also a plus.  So \\"District 9\\" is still science fiction, but one with a powerful message about immigration, apartheid and social ostracism.  The idea of the hapless protagonist mutating into one of the aliens may seem like a bit too much and unbelievable, but his complete physical transformation into one of the extra-terrestrials is simply the culmination of his slow gradual \\"alienation\\" from human society.  If you are expecting fun escapism, find another film to take yourself and your kids to.  If you expect to see something different from the usual \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"StarTrek\\" popcorn flicks, watch this incredible movie now.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|All the tracks stand out except \\"Closer\\", \\"Illusion\\", and \\"Looking For An Angel\\". Got the negative out the way, now let's get to the positive.    Apparently everyone is raving over \\"Get Outta My Way\\" which had raving success due to the \\"Aphrodite Megamix\\" that was released a week before the album released. But listening to the full song leaves not too much more to be desired, since the \\"Megamix version\\" was just a snippet.    But really \\"Can't Beat The Feeling\\" should have took it's place in the track listing. It takes you on a total ride. Of course the song \\"Too Much\\" does the same thing. But I guess it only depends on how the listener feels at the moment.    \\"Can't Beat The Feeling\\" is unarguably the best feel good track on the whole entire album. If you haven't gotten attached to it, give it a couple more listens.    This album is certainly a step up from her 2007 release \\"X\\".     The track \\"Everything Is Beautiful\\" is uniquely haunting when you get into the middle of the song. It literally grabs hold of you and by the end leave you feeling like you're lost in a world of possibilities.    Kylie has a great formula here, and she should stick to it. That turn she took when making \\"Impossible Princess\\" was a total wreck. She is better off using the electronic \\"studio produced\\" sound and not organic kicks and guitars, it fits better with her vocals.     Her self titled album \\"Kylie\\", which released in 1988 will always be my favorite out of all her albums. It's epic nostalgia heaven.
0375831002|5.0|Very fast. Item in perfect condition. Good price. Very smooth and easy transation thank you.
B000003TA4|5.0|this is an amazing album, it was so amazing that people have spent the last 18-19 years looking for something to even compare to this album this band and have fallen short. Its the best and worst thing to happen to the industry. So good it opens your mind to new music while at the same time making most of what youve heard since not quite as good as you would like it.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This was a very captivating movie. It keeps your attention all the way thru. Then the ending provides the grandist illusion of all. I very much recamend this film.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|This movie was about a federal officer who goes to an island to investigate a missing fugitive. The island has a supernatural feel to it, that gives off a creepy vibe. The staff are very odd when it comes time to answer questions. The missing girl is a criminal patient in a prison mental health facility. The explanation on how the girl went missing was again unexplainable and mysterious. Leo who is the key character and lead officer feels frustrated because he is not getting answers and is starting to pitch out signs of anxiety. He is thinking he will write up his reports and leave due to the staff and head adminstrator's lack of cooperation. He has eerie flashbacks before leaving which prompt him to stay and give us a clue to his character. He is holding onto a painful memory that haunts him. This memory is also including dreamlike episodes with his deceased wife, who helps him to gain access to solving particular problems or guiding him in his life journey. Her image is also suspense building and dark. The story leads to the runaway being found. She is living in a world of her own and cannot grasp the reality of her circumstances. She has killed her children and been on the island to serve out her time while being treated. She meets up with Leo's character and sees him as her dead husband. Until she shifts abruptly and realizes he is not what she thought. Here the story starts to become quite interesting. It is hard to go into and there are a few twists which are quite arresting and thought provoking. The plot takes on a whole new avenue of development. Is Leo actually a patient who is suffering from a delusion. A delusion is a fixed fact that cannot be broken or is he being turned into this because he has stumbled onto some possible damning evidence that could hurt others. This is where I think the viewer has to decide. It could be easy and he could just be a patient not wanting to face his actions and living out his delusion or he really could have been erased,meaning his identity taken from him by mind control and drugs. I won't go further with this. What I took away from this film was an uneasy feeling of coincidence, won't go into why. I liked the isolation of an island and the rocky cliffs with the crashing waves. I guess it gave off a remote piercing kind of feel, wild and beautiful. The isolation fed into the eerie hospital and adminstrator's personality. The apparation of the woman doctor,or was it, seemed intriguing again lending a question. Do you believe it? Could something like this be done? Absolutely. Would one want to be in a mental hospital like this. Was it pretending to be caring and concerned about unlocking the psyche from its unending hell or was it experimenting on people for the benefit of science or something else. These are again thoughts, questions. The atmosphere feels secretive and guarded so that suggests a possible dysfunction. The staff could have been looked at thru the eyes of a delusional patient so its all uncertain. There are parts that i would have liked to have viewed again but did not. Memories being taken? Feelings being medicated.
1423113497|5.0|I must admit I was truly unsure about this book as a gift to a nine year old.  However, after reading it I was okay with it.  It is an excellent book and truly adventurous.  The author has a gift of placing you right there at the scene. Go with young Percy on his adventures and you won't be disappointed.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I loved the books and the movie in the theater.  The movie looks great on Blue-ray, but I'd have to say that there are better looking BD titles, like the new Alice In Wonderland for example.  Perhaps it's the darker scenery (and tone) of this movie.  It still blows away the standard-def DVD.
0321701763|4.0|This book, or another like it, are for me necessary to even partially understand the capabilities of a massive program like PS. A \\"lessons\\" CD comes with it; I wouldn't recommend buying any book without that assist.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story Three was definitely a strong and fun animated movie. The beginning of the movie finds Andy's toys figuring out a way to stay in his life when he packs up to head off to college.  Unexpectedly, they find themselves working together to get out of some sticky daycare adventures they find themselves in courtesy of a bear that turns out to be different from what he appears and his assistant Big Baby. The group of Andy's end up realizing even more the importance of teamwork to help stay together. I also thought the addition of the Barbie and Ken characters added some creativity and life to the animation. However, the two main characters of Toy Story 3 were Buzz Lightyear and Woody, who were very much brought to life in an excellent fashion. There were other toys that were creatively woven into the story (such as Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, Stretch, Chunk, Sparks, Jack-In-the box and others that appeared) , but the characters of Buzz Lightyear and Woody were animated to play visible roles in the evolution of the plot. The plot was effectively constructed to wrap up the ending of the Toy Story 3 trilogy in a cohesive manner.

B001GCUO5M|2.0|Shutter Island (2009) with Leonardo DiCaprio was a tremendous dissapointment to me. For its nice cinematic and fine camera work I rate it at 4 stars, very good acting 5 stars, and basic story only 2 stars.  I guess it was because of the many TV spots and DVD commercials promoting this film and the fact that it starred Leonardo DiCaprio that I was especially dissapointed, as I expected something much better.  This movie substituted mental illness for a good mystery, as have so many films going back to the late 50's, but especially since the mid 90's which have all made mental illness a fairly common theme or sub-theme. I did not like or enjoy this plot and I actually felt cheated when everything was explained, once again, by a simple case of insanity. It is just not fair to build up what the viewer believes to be true and then switch all the ground rules. I guess I should have rented it before buying it.<br /><br />I love surprise endings which are earned by the story, as in Vertigo, Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable, but this film just cheated.
B003VGD340|5.0|I am loving season 5 so far. Matt Smith brings a new, slightly innocent take on the Doctor. We've seen the doctor as many things, but never sweetly innocent before. His attempts in this episode to fit in with \\"real\\" people were laugh out loud funny. I won't give any spoilers - you need to see it for yourself.     I subscribed to season 5 so I won't miss a minute of this absolutely brilliant season.     This episode had all the elements for me: scifi adventure, humor, and romance. The scifi was there, but the emphasis was on the characters. We get to see Matt Smith really making the Doctor role his own. And the character of Amy continues to develop. She and this doctor make a perfect team.
0316069906|4.0|Eating meat is a strange thing. We often think of issues like abortion, religion, and immigration as the most polarizing topics that cause people to forgo reason in order to hold the party line, but those pale in comparison to how we forgo logic and intellectual honesty when it comes to meat. We deride other cultures for eating dogs and cats, tear up when we see those Sarah McLachlan SPCA commercials with the cute animals that need homes, give our children stuffed toy pigs and cows with cute names, watch kids' movies that portray a farmer trying to kill an animal for meat as evil and the animal who survives as hero, while at the same time eating fried pig belly for breakfast, slices of a pig's butt and thighs for lunch. Even for those of us who are not vegetarians, it behooves a philosophical and introspective person to at least be aware of and reflect on this hypocrisy rather than shut it out and pretend there is no conflict.<br /><br />One of the most memorable demonstrations of this conflict comes from an interview that Foer pulls from another book, Slaughterhouse. A worker on the kill floor describes a young pig nuzzling his leg like a puppy looking for attention and compassion. A few minutes later, the same worker beats the pig to death with a lead pipe. We tolerate an industry that kills animals with the same levels of intelligence and compassion as the pets we love and pamper not because we have to in order to survive, but because we like the way the pig's meat tastes, and because it's easy for us to forget the reality of where that stack of smoked pink flesh came from.<br /><br />Foer takes a good look at why we find it easier to forget the reality of meat than change our eating habits. Many of us, myself included, can identify with his story at the outset of contemplating vegetarianism, but ultimately going back to meat as we forget and fall back into familiar habits and traditions. If the book has any flaws, it is that Foer becomes too passionate at times and loses the organizational flow, reiterating points he has already made in sections that do not fit or jumping to another idea for a single paragraph before continuing his train of thought, like a frenetic friend who is so excited about the conversation topic that he can't slow down and stay on track. At a few points he also takes unnecessary leaps of logic without adequate citation or proof, maybe relying on the fact that most of his readers will be the already-converted who will not question his analysis and conclusions. But by and large, his novel is well researched and supported, persuasively written, and fair. It is definitely worth a read.organizational flow, reiterating points he has already made in sections that do not fit or jumping to another idea for a single paragraph before continuing his train of thought, like a frenetic friend who is so excited about the conversation topic that he can't slow down and stay on track.

B002ZG997C|4.0|For me, this film was well put together, the story was good,  the direction was sharp (The Hughes Brothers have proven   themselves to be capable and astute directors who show   amazing range and diversity at directing various film genres).  Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and all of the supporting cast   turned in solid believable performances, there was lots   of action, brutal fight sequences, explosions, there are   even some comical moments. There's also a revelation  towards the end which will take you by surprise if  you weren't paying attention throughout the film.  I didn't go into this movie with any lofty expectations,  or comparing it to other post-apocalyptic fare, I just   took it for what it was worth and I was entertained.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good  story, good acting, action, and ultimately, entertainment.  If you are the type of person who expects every movie to   be \\"Citizen Kane\\" or like to pick every flaw in a film   apart, or have to compare it to something in the same   genre for it to make sense to you, then you probably   should skip this one!

1577314808|5.0|As a spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle is magnificent. This book is exactly as the name implies \\"Enlightenment\\". His way of describing everyday situations and that we face and putting them in perspective helps to relieve the stress of life. I am now reading it fro the second time.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have loved the Samantha Morton/Ciarian Hinds version for 10 years, but I've found a new favorite. Yes, Mr. Rochester is way too sexy, but who cares? This version includes so much more detail and romance than any other I've seen.
B000RHKARO|1.0|Heard good reviews. Gave it a listen a few times, just couldn't get into it.
B002ZG97RE|1.0|My wife and I just finished viewing this movie last night.  First of all, it was so boring and slow that we had to watch it in 3 different 'sittings' because we fell asleep the first 2 times.....   and we both said to each other as we struggled to sit through the last 40 minutes of it: \\" Gee, I have not wanted to turn off a movie and never watch the rest of it , in a long long time! \\".   Yes, it is that boring!   Now, let me get on to the second complaint - This is pure propaganda to make one feel sorry for the Iraqi people, the poor old Iraqi bald general and his officers!  It also is intended to make you HATE the special forces, and most of the other American soldiers and officers... basically , anyone except glorious Matt Damon and his few special follower soldiers.  In this movie, Damon runs around apparently with no chain of command ( he doesn't answer to any higher ups for most of the movie ), he even STRIKES one of the special forces guys in the face and there is NOTHING done about it.   PLEEEEASE!!!!!!!  The movie shows the 'poor helpless\\" iraqi people that just want water!  that is all they want!  and the mean old AMERICANS DRIVE RIGHT PAST!   This movie is so blatantly anti America that I can hardly type right now I am so angry!   SPOILER ALERT:  DAMON even causes the DEATH of the main special forces guy by distracting him at the film's end and a iraqi shoots the SF guy dead.            The last half hour of this movie has a feel of \\" gee I hope the mean ole Americans do not catch the good ole Iraqi bald General and his men! \\"   Wow, a Black hawk heli gets shot down by a R P G ?  yeah RIIIIGHT, SAM, maybe, but , doubt an RPG would do the job..... and Damon's face is shown as the bird crashes down in flames......  think that was an accident?  You can see the look on his face!!!!!=== That scene was there to get the crowd to clap! : \\" yay , the evil SF crew that is hunting the \\"propaganda kid\\"- Damon, just got one of the their evil helis shot down! yay! \\"  Iwanted to turn it off again, right then.  I even asked the wife - \\" have you seen enough of this?\\"    I agree with the other reviews on the camera shake.  VERY DISTRACTING, in fact, might have been the only thing that kept us awake at all!          Avoid this movie at all costs.  I am glad i didn't pay ONE PENNY to see it , as my wife paid to rent it.   I would have demanded my money back.   I wish I had never seen it.                    In conclusion, Mr. Damon,  the next stinker movie you make , I will be here to write another review of it, because I think you like making left wing - anti-American statements in your movies , you America Hater Liberal!!!!!!
1423113381|3.0|This is a really fun book torn right out of the Lightning Thief planner.  There are young heroes with missing parents who are both living somewhat unhappy lives, but who discover their lives have more going on than they thought!  There are gods and goddesses.  Amazing battles. Funny lines.  Minor romance.  Quests, magic, and talking animals.  Monsters roaming around American tourist sites.<br /><br />If I were a kid, I'd give this a 5-star rating, but as an adult I can't help feeling as though I've read all this before.  The plot is too much like the Lightning Thief's plot, and because of that I felt that there weren't any real surprises.  The kids who are the narrators also never seemed fazed by the odd events that were happening to them, and the lack of surprise and fear in their demeanor made for a book that was almost devoid of tension, even though there was danger around every turn.<br /><br />The 'fun' content of the book should hook most readers, but I don't think any adult should bother with this unless they'd like a primer on Egyptian mythology.  Riordan did an excellent job doling out that information.

0872863107|5.0|Allen Ginsberg is considered one of the great poets of our time, and almost without exception is considered the best poet of the Beat Generation.  Both of these statements are true, in my opinion.  The only beat poet who comes close is Gregory Corso, though they were poets with completely different styles, making them difficult to compare.  Howl is extremely poetic and artistic, but in a way that envelops and expresses thoughts at a basic human level.  The style is raw, loud, cacephonic, even vulgar in a good way because it is real.  As you read Howl, you see and feel the joy, pain, and anger of humans living in the modern world, as they struggle through the crowd and the buildings and the machinery that make this world operate.  Howl is real, human, raw, and any number of other adjectives that are not necessary, because the message comes through with a serious reading of the poem.  The rest of the poems are equally great, but the book is defined by its namesake poem.
0345495004|5.0|Very well written and fascinating story.  She captured the emotions behind the story in a very realistic manner.
0743455967|5.0|The first chunk of this book tells King's early struggles in a delightful and often inspiring way. From his mother's early encouragement of his stories (and telling him that he was better than a copying hack)to his first novel that his wife, \\"Tabby,\\" pulled out of the trash and encouraged him to finish. The problem he was having with the novel was that the main character, \\"Carrie,\\" was a painful POV for him to immerse himself into. BTW, that manuscript that he was ready to toss brought in 400k in book rights back in the 70's. That part of the story, him going from crappy jobs trying to keep his family afloat and then having enough money to write full time, darn near brought tears to my eyes. The man also acknowledges that he owes it all to his wife, Tabby, his ever faithful \\"ideal reader.\\"    During the first piece, we find out that his brother, Dave, who seems to be trying to find his one \\"true north,\\" always gets King to be a part of his latest \\"super duper\\" projects. Reading about Dave, one may notice the similarity between King and \\"Bow Wow\\" in his short story, \\"The End of the Whole Mess.\\" Hell, one notices a lot of bits of his childhood are wrapped up within his stories when you read this book.    In the last piece, although it doesn't give you the nuts and bolts of writing fiction as there are plenty of other books dedicated to that, he does give his opinion on the essential process and how he manages it. As he freely admits, his personal process may not be for everyone as many writers have different opinions on things such as drafts, character profiles, and the like, his opinions are most definitely helpful as an inspiration to those who think they may find joy in the art and craft of fiction writing. As King puts it, a fiction writer must dedicate themselves to both reading and writing in order to succeed and I would suggest this be one of the many books that you add to your library. He makes it worth your valuable time and money even if you are not a big fan of his fiction. Personally, I have ALWAYS loved his short stories.    And yes, I am what King calls \\"constant reader.\\" Enjoy the read :)    --------    And if you read this review, Mr. King, I would like to give you my opinion on why \\"The Stand\\" is an all time favorite of some of your fans. The stand is unique in that it is several short stories that converge to create a novel. The pacing, the POV changes, and the combination thereof are brilliant. Of course, I'm sure it helped that you \\"killed [some of] your darlings\\" to make it manageable. You told the damn stories and you did it well :)
0061706620|4.0|The delivery was quick. The book was not exactly what I expected. I thought the binding would be metal spiral (more of the journal type) but it is just a hardbook. But I DEFINITELY recommend if you are a Supernatural fan!!! The book is great and you see it from a different perspective. A lot of people comment about the books accuracy and what you have to understand is that when going from tv show to book or even book to tv show/movie; it can be difficult to incorporate all the ideas to fit nicely. It is a great read and I HIGHLY recommend it.
B001J710Y8|5.0|If you're into the notably offbeat, this terrific film is probably for you. A creepier tale has never been told.<br /><br />*The Story*<br /><br />A young girl is reported missing on a small island off the coast of England and a Sergeant-Constable, a devoutly serious Christian, is dispatched there to look into the matter. He has to access the island by float-plane. When he arrives, it doesn't take him long to discover some elemental facts:<br /><br />1. He is being passively resisted, deceived, and decoyed as he seeks information about the missing girl.<br /><br />2. He is informed by an island patriarch that the islanders have suffered for some time due to poor agicultural harvests.<br /><br />3. He is personally displeased to observe that the island population is clearly comprised of a pagan culture of grinning folks with an apparent taste for bawdy buxom barmaids, Maypole celebrations, and various forms of ritual sacrifice.<br /><br />Things go from bad to worse for the highly-irritated policeman and then he suddenly meets with unexpected and heartening success... and then things get *really* creepy!<br /><br />I've watched this intriguing, terrific color film over and over for many years and I never tire of viewing it. It's perfectly cast; non-Brits can understand the localized cultural nuances of the story; the cinematography, locations, and sets are tops; the pacing is spot-on... it's really just a flawless film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0375703764|5.0|Danielewski has, in my opinion, created a fantastic book that engages the reader in ways most contemporary books do not. So may questions are raised by the book, and so few are answered. The house itself is a mystery that is never fully solved, as are the stories of Zampano and Johnny, leaving the reader questioning even their own lives. When I was reading the story, it influenced my dreams, the ever changing landscape of the house mirrored in an ever changing dreamscape. When I finished reading, I felt like I had finally made it out of that labyrinth. And, like Navidson himself, I find myself wanting to go back into the labyrinth, to better understand it, to contemplate what its existence means.<br /><br />If your grasp of reality is tenuous, House of Leaves may very well push you over the edge. But for some people, that's the best part. Just be sure to bring a spool of thread, so you can find your way back.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Especially love \\"The Blind Men and the Elephant\\" and my all-time favorite, \\"If No One Ever Marries Me.\\"  It's incredible to think of everything being accomplished on this album: the resurrection of long-lost rhymes (and the poets that wrote them,) plus the contextualization of old tyme verses in the all too fast-paced and technological twenty-first century.  The biographical booklet, complete with lyrics and photos of the various authors, is well-crafted, beautifully presented and entertaining to boot.  I will definitely share this with my eight-year-old niece and will hang onto it in hopes of treasuring it with my own children in years to come.  Many thanks and cheers for Miss Merchant!
B003JLA4KS|3.0|I thought it was a pretty good documentary, although a little short. After they got to the album Signals, everything was just skimmed over (or not touched on at all) after that. It's too bad they didn't release this documentary after Hold Your Fire because everything after that is pretty much crap, and as of today there are a whopping 6 studio albums after Hold your fire. Yeah, there are a few good songs here and there, like `Half the world',  `Dreamline', & `Between Sun and Moon' but not much more. I mean, don't take my word for it...just go to any live Rush concert and notice how quiet the audience gets if they play anything after Hold Your Fire. Crickets...nothing but crickets.    A few observations...    -The Caress of Steel segment was interesting because I always thought that album sucked, too. Especially compared to the albums before and after it.   -Sabastian Bach is looking mighty fat these days. WOW!  - Neil is looking old. Doubt he will be physically able to keep up his incredible drumming more than a few more years, unless they slow the tempos WAY down at the concerts.  - It was a disappointing to hear Neil say that they were DONE making albums like Hemispheres and would never go back to those types of arrangements when it is Hemispheres that is probably their very best album.    Closing thought...    I just wish they'd bring back Terry Brown as a producer. Can you imagine if the word got out that they were making another long concept song like 2112 or Hemispheres and Terry Brown was producing it! Pre-order sales would go through the roof!! And this would make up for all the crap Rush has been putting out for the last 20 years. Actually, Rush might be so far gone that not even Terry Brown could help them anymore, but I think he's their last shot.
030745455X|3.0|This book was slow as molasses! I really enjoyed \\"Dragon Tatoo...\\" but this one felt like a very thin story padded out to fill 600+ pages. Way, way too much detail about each and every cop/individual involved in the case. Some good moments, definitely, but for me, few and too far between!

B0035WTJFW|3.0|I'm not going to critique the movie itself.  Many others have done so here.<br /><br />My important advice is, if you already own the widescreen DVD set for this movie, don't waste your money on upgrading to the Blu-Ray version.  Of course, I'm assuming your Blu-Ray player does a decent job of upscaling standard definition movies.<br /><br />I love the detail and clarity of HD recordings.  However, in some cases, the Blu-Ray version really doesn't provide any better a picture than does an upscaled DVD.  This is such a case.  It's surprising, considering the packaging specifically touts that Steven Spielberg approved the transfer from film to this HD video.<br /><br />If you are a home theater sound purist, perhaps the Dolby and DTS Surround Sound will make it worth your upgrade.  I didn't think so.<br /><br />One other beef I have with this Blu-Ray addition is with the Extra Features.  In the DVD version, the interviews have cut-aways showing related video of the planning, shooting and final footage.  In the Blu-Ray version, you have to navigate away from the interview through menus to see the video related to what is discussed.  Perhaps they thought more interactive menus would be a selling point.  For me, it is much more cumbersome and an annoyance.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you decide what version of the film is right for you.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I really, really enjoyed this series!  The best way I know how to say how good this show is... My wife would see me watching the first couple of episodes, and \\"EWWW,\\" or I would also get, \\"WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING (this is in regards to the SENSUALITY of the show).  Then by episode 4 I believe she was next to me for the remaining shows!  \\"THIS IS A GOOD SHOW!\\" was what I heard at the end of each episode. Nuff said!  Check it out!  It is worth it!  Can't wait for season 2' in the form of a prequel.

0596007124|5.0|The key issue with design patterns is that software engineers have to know them in order to use them.  This book addresses that issue by working hard to ensure that the patterns are absorbed by the reader in the necessary detail ... as opposed to simply documenting them.  The Head First books are all good at helping one absorb material ... but there may be no other area of software engineering where the approach is needed more.
B000P12LWY|4.0|The creator of this show admits on the website that this was not meant to be historically accurate.  Instead, this Showtime original series is nothing less than what Showtime has come to represent; sensationalized storylines, sexy, lustful characterizations, and an all-around fantastic romp for mature audiences.      As someone who had a prior interest and some knowledge of the period, I was skeptical of this series.  Having watched other movies and television shows which covered Henry VIII and the period around him in a more accurate light, I started watching simply because of Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Henry Cavill.  However, the compelling storylines kept me watching episode after episode.  While Showtime has, as usual, not shied away from explicit sex scenes a la medieval \\"Californication\\", for the most part, given the already dramatic history of England's break from the Catholic Church, its not too far-fetched to imagine some of the events that transpire through the series.    This show is probably best suited for those of us who are willing to not take the historical aspect of the story too seriously and who enjoy watching beautifully shot and definitely lush period pieces.

B003RS1V1E|5.0|There are two near-perfect very dark comedies on TV still in production.  One is Dexter, which is totally different in every way except excellence.<br /><br />Breaking Bad is an absolute masterpiece portrayal of the human condition taken to the max.  Every episode weaves into every other episode, as do our lives from day to day.  The acting is more like life-portraits...amazing.  The videography is absolute artistry without the bogus melodrama of the CSIs and other lesser series.<br /><br />Season 3 is far darker than the first two.  The intensity never ends, and as it would be in life, the laughs are less.  We find ourselves laughing at our own foibles as portrayed by the characters in this amazing ensemble.  We also know that with each increasingly darker turn that our inner psyches could be on the same level as theirs, given dire enough circumstances.<br /><br />I will not give away plot-lines to those who have not been fortunate enough to watch through the season.  If, for any reason, you have not seen the first two seasons, there is only one way to watch...From the beginning!  The seven episodes of season one and the full run from season two cannot be missed.  Even purchasing the series on Video on Demand, I will still purchase the disks, which, since Roku, has become far less of a habit.<br /><br />You are left with an incredible cliff-hanger at the end of the season, and the previous review came as closer or closer to informing those who haven't seen it than is really fair.  The less details you know, the better off you and your imagination are as you cling to your seat through each and every episode.<br /><br />I will let one cat out of the bag.  Season four will not begin until July of 2011.  I seldom plan on or for anything past tomorrow, but I will wait for it eagerly every day.  I don't know how many times I will watch the series over and again in the next year, but I get the feeling that I will remember nearly every word of every wonderful, sinister, heart-thumping roller coaster each episode has to offer.<br /><br />I honestly never knew television could be this good.

B002TZS5GU|2.0|Carriers / B002TZS5GU<br /><br />\\"Carriers\\" is a movie that thinks much more highly of itself than I do. The standard fare is on display - a mysterious disease, for which there is no cure and little understanding, has ravaged humanity, leaving society completely devastated as governments crumble and social structures between people break down overnight. With social structures completely dissolved, it's obviously time for the inevitable raping, pillaging, suiciding, and so forth in order to make some sort of statement about the state of the human condition in the face of an apocalypse... which might be kind of innovative, except that it's already been done several times over, particularly with [[ASIN:B001LLH8SE Blindness]].<br /><br />Fundamentally, \\"Carriers\\" seems to think that it's terribly edgy and clever, but there's nothing here that you haven't seen a hundred times before. Frequently mentioned \\"rules\\" for survival and goofball destruction of property for the fun of it, straight out of [[ASIN:B002WY65VU Zombieland]]. A more organized and serious group that initially seems to have its act together, but is all too willing to crack from the strain and start raping and pillaging, fresh from [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]]. And you have the \\"survivors\\" slowly becoming infected and hiding the fact from the rest of the group, as in every other zombie/contagious illness movie ever made, ever.<br /><br />Derivative isn't bad - taking elements that have worked before and sticking them together in new and interesting ways is a tried-and-true, if unoriginal, way to make your movie. But \\"Carriers\\" seems to think sp highly of itself, with far too many \\"you can't handle the truth\\" speeches to drive how that, gosh, the apocalypse *sucks*, and the smug writing and contrived situations meant to show the downfall of the survivors' humanity just comes across as tired, forced, and poorly done compared to better offerings out there.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

B002QW7ALM|3.0|Pandorum / B002QW7ALM<br /><br />As a horror movie, I would give \\"Pandorum\\" 4 stars, but as a science fiction movie, I feel that 3 stars would be generous. When Ben Foster wakes from cryogenic sleep for what should be a routine flight shift on a space-faring colony ship, he is surprised to find that very little seems to be functioning on the ship, and utterly horrified as he comes to realize that the colony ship is infested with what can only be described as \\"space orcs\\" (a la \\"Lord of the Rings\\"), who mercilessly hunt humans through the darkened corridors of the ship and whose main feeding grounds are the cryopod chambers, where they wait for poor, doomed souls to randomly pop out of cryosleep (due to general ship malfunctions) for them to feast upon.<br /><br />The horror aspect of this movie is relatively well done. The scariest parts, to me, were prior to the discovery of the space-orcs - with Foster floudering around dealing with the demons of isolation and claustrophobia, not to mention the horror of finding dead bodies down jeffries tubes and hanging in the dark corridors - that's enough to scare anyone silly. Once the space-orcs show up, the horror dials down a bit - the monsters lack the nightmare fuel potential of, say, the aliens from [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]], and orcs can never truly be scary after \\"Lord of the Rings\\" - you can't help but feel that Gandalf will show up any minute to shoo them off the ship. Still, the \\"trapped on a ship with homicidal maniacs\\" plotline will get you pretty far, and \\"Pandorum\\" does a very solid job with what it has to work with.<br /><br />Plot-wise, however, is where it all falls down. There's very little criticism I can level at the movie without causing massive spoilers, except to say that the plot has more holes than a sieve and (to paraphrase Yahtzee) contains science so soft you could spread it on a dinner roll. Not that soft science in movies isn't a legitimately proud tradition, but there's a difference between \\"technobabble\\" and \\"just making stuff up\\" - and the final plot resolution shouldn't contain so many dangling threads that there's no way anything you just saw could logically have happened, given basic human nature, laws of physics, and common sense. As usual, all this warping of reality is done to service a couple of major plot twists - and, as usual, the twists are quite good except for the fact that they're logically impossible. But - again - I don't want to spoil, so I'll just say that if you come to \\"Pandorum\\" for the horror, you'll probably be satisfied as long as you're careful to not think too hard (or, really, at *all*) about the plot.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollmaking stuff up\\" - and the final plot resolution shouldn't contain so many dangling threads that there's no way anything you just saw could logically have happened, given basic human nature, laws of physics, and common sense.

0891419063|5.0|After watching \\"The Pacific\\" on HBO, I found this book filled in a lot of detail I missed, or perhaps wasn't shown, on those episodes. I was a teenager in 1944 and E.B. Sledge could have been one of the guys I went to school with.  None of us who didn't actually go to war, could appreciate the horror the soldiers endured. I'm sorry there was no television then. The nightly news programs on radio were only 15 minutes long, but we all waited to hear the grim news every night. I remember all of the mothers and girlfriends of soldiers were terrified when it was learned that her soldier was being shipped to the CBI (China, Burma, India) or the Pacific.<br /><br />This book is a view of WWII that doesn't spare us the awful details of what actually happened in these battles.

0316044695|5.0|This is the finest book I have ever read, and I believe anyone who considers themselves an American should buy it and read it.  Be prepared to get emotionally attached to four people most of you, including myself, never knew until now.  Be prepared to read 250 pages in one sitting because once you start the second half you won't be able to put it down.  Be prepared to laugh.  Be prepared to cry.  Be prepared to read a political view you may or may not agree with, but I urge you to read it closely, with an open mind.  The views in this book are that of a warrior who has been to hell and back, watched his best friends die and cheated death himself.  This book touched me, maybe even changed me.  I finished it last night before I went to bed.  I lay in bed next to my wife, my kids were tucked in safe and sound, and my last thoughts were of Mr. Luttrell and the men that died that day.  I felt guilty.  Guilty knowing all I had to do was jump in my truck and drive 5 minutes to speak to my best friend one more time.  Guilty I would get a good night's sleep knowing Mr. Luttrell more than likely wouldn't.  Guilty knowing that my inner peace is shouldered 100% by the men and women of our armed forces whose battles are violently replayed nightly in their dreams.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy it, read it twice, and when life gets \\"tough\\" read it again.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I don't want to appear snarky but \\"The Blind Side\\" is not what I would call a great movie.  Where it excels is in audience manipulation.  Emotion runs so high here that you forget you're watching a first-class sports weepie.  This ranks with \\"Miracle\\", \\"Rocky\\", and \\"The Rookie\\" in the annals of sports films that tug at your heart strings.  The film is anchored by the terrific dynamic of Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron as the surrogate mother and her large but fragile adopted son.  One thing I would like to note.  I was gratified to see Bullock win the Oscar but if you isolated this specific performance I would probably have given the prize to either Gabourey Sidibe for \\"Precious\\" or Carey Mulligan in \\"An Education\\".  \\"The Blind Side\\" is the type of film that is best to be enjoyed and brush aside any minor quibbles.

When she does show up, it is a rare treat.<br /><br />It's grueling, in the meantime to read about page after page of Blomkvist and his slutty business partner, with whom he is having an adulterous affair.  We are also treated to such mundane details as what he ate for breakfast/lunch/dinner, what he sees when he looks out the window...what he fed the CAT?!<br /><br />At this point, where I am leaving off (possibly for good) Blomkvist hasn't even met Lisbeth.  WHen is that going to happen?  When is he actually going to do something OTHER than eat, read the paper, screw berger, call berger, think about something somebody said, and WALK...?<br /><br />There are brief times when his conversations with Vanger regarding the death of his beloved grand niece, and they actually make the story seem as if it is going somewhere...Or so I had hoped.<br /><br />But unfortunately, we are treated to more mundane passages about Blomkvist's eating habits, what clothes he puts on, how cold it is outside...etc...etc...<br /><br />It feels like Chinese water torture.

142313494X|4.0|I had been hearing good things about Rick Riordan's YA fantasy series, but it wasn't until a half-price sale at the bookstore and the release of the movie (which I still haven't seen) that I finally decided to catch up with the bandwagon. I knew that it followed the basic premise of the typical coming-of-age drama in a fantasy setting, in which a troubled youngster discovers that he has innate power and a lot of trouble to go with it. To harness his power, achieve his goals, and discover his place in his newly discovered world is Percy Jackson's ongoing character arc. Though it is clearly inspired by the success of Harry Potter (right down to the format of the titles: variations of \\"Hero's Name and the Intriguing Noun\\"), it's never openly derivative.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a twelve year boy who finds it difficult to stay out of trouble. Constantly expelled from school for bad behaviour, he's finding his current position in a private school palatable thanks to a sympathetic teacher and a good friend with a muscular impediment in his legs. But he struggles with his dyslexia and fumes over his unhappy home life (his mother is married to a beatnik), he becomes swiftly aware that there are stranger things going on around him.<br /><br />His teacher Mr Brunner and his friend Grover clearly know something about him that they're not sharing, and after a terrifying encounter with a nasty teacher, Percy discovers the truth. As you probably already know from the blurb, Percy (and many others like him) is the child of a mortal and a god; a \\"half-blood\\" whose very existence makes him a target of malevolent powers in the world. The only safe place is Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for the children of the gods, where they can learn about their skills, heritage and powers. There he discovers the real identities of Mr Brunner and Grover (a centaur and a satyr, respectively) - but he looses someone infinitely precious to him on the way.<br /><br />As he goes through his training he learns more about this new sub-world, particularly that each half-blood is expected at some stage to undergo a quest to prove themselves, much like the demi-god heroes of myth and legend. Percy, along with his new friend Annabeth, the daughter of Athena, get their chance when a conspiracy is uncovered. Someone is trying to foster discord among the gods by stealing the master lightening bolt of Zeus, casting the blame on Percy for the theft. To clear his name and prevent a catastrophe, Percy sets off toward Los Angeles where the entrance to the Underworld awaits, with Annabeth and Grover in tow.<br /><br />This is really only the barebones of the plot, as this first installment of the Percy Jackson series is surprisingly complex. Basically, Percy has a lot of stuff to do and there's no time to waste! From his home life to his camp life to his journey across America, things barely slow down in a plot that contains everything but the kitchen sink. Riordan's most innovative feature is his \\"updating\\" of Greek mythology into a contemporary setting, and it is the readers who know their rudimentary legends that will derive the most enjoyment out of seeing familiar characters pop up in their modern forms.<br /><br />Percy himself is a nice enough kid, struggling with his differences but keeping a hopeful outlook whenever things seem to be at their worst. Told in first-person narrative, it's Percy's own voice that guides us through the story, and he remains chatty and natural throughout. Grover makes for a great sidekick/best friend, with a back-story and personal problems of his own, and though Annabeth initially comes across as the typical feisty \\"I ain't no damsel in distress\\" love interest, she also comes into her own as the book progresses. But at times the trio can be unforgivably stupid. Say that you're on a dangerous mission, and know full well that deadly monsters are attacking you at every available opportunity. Would you take time out to go sightseeing in the Gateway Arc? Would you enter a suspicious casino where the waiters ply money into your hands and cater to your every need? Would you follow a creepy waterbed salesman into his shop? Every time the kids fall for this sort of thing, my respect for them dropped as swiftly as their IQ points.<br /><br />If anything, the plot is perhaps a little *too* busy, with the protagonists racing at breakneck speed from one dangerous situation to the next, several plot coupons floating in and out of the story, and the themes of parental abandonment, responsibility, teenage delinquency, and the power of friendship piling up. And was anyone else a little disappointed that after all the fuss over Zeus's lightening bolt, it never actually got *used*? (Judging from the trailer, the film rectifies this problem).<br /><br />Still, this was an immensely satisfying read, and a sympathetic hero, a race against time, a fusing of past and present, the mystery of a missing parent, action and adventure, and plenty of material leftover for the sequels, means that [[ASIN:1423103343 The Sea of Monsters]] is definitely on my reading list.us casino where the waiters ply money into your hands and cater to your every need?

0393078299|5.0|Modern Education have been conducted in a way that the philosophical ideas behind the great theories discussed in Physics have been kept away from the standard curriculum at universitats. This book belongs to the few one I have found to be interested (I´m speaking as a Theoretical Physicist) because it not only develops the historical frame in which the theory was created (the base of the theory), but also the debates, the ideas that came first and evolved in the way. All of this discussed in a way that keeps you in the book for hours without you even knowing it. Even if you are an already mastered in the area of the Quantum Physics, or if you are starting it, this book will help you understand many of the ¨why¨ we are always asking. This book can make an excellent supplementary lecture for any student in quantum theory, because it fills the gaps that modern textbooks leave to the students that do not understand why is necessary the change in the classical theory, and how it is made. Quantum Theory is not a complete theory, it still have many holes and weak points upon which the theory is develop, for those interested in research the base of the theory, this book can help you refresh your mind from all the heavy reading and give you a clearer perspective.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Season 4 starts off at a nice clip.  The episodes resolve on an episode to episode basis as the writers slowly reveal the details of the major plot which really becomes the main focus 4 or 5 episodes into the season.    The start felt very fast and refreshing where I could laugh at the situations Dexter got into and how he dealt with his life.  Like a needle slowly being pushed into your skin, the season escalates nicely as you watch with horror and your mind imagines the worst and wonders how events will progress. You will get caught up in it and by the end will feel like you have been punched fully in the face.  I didn't see it coming, and I loved it!      Don't read ANYTHING about what happens in this show.  You are in for a real treat.    As a side note: John Lithgow does a wonderful job.  The guy is a riot in his other shows, but in this, you will be pleased.  He pulls off his character in an effective and creepy manner.  I really don't like the big star guest appearances...I had to live through the first Batman movie series...In Dexter, it has been done well.    The writers have made a well-paced, clever season, that stays true to the reality of the prior shows.     All the actors have done a wonderful job bringing these characters to life.    The direction is even quite enjoyable.    This season may really be my favorite.  I am going to have to watch the first season again and put it to the test, but it is definitely better than the second and third seasons, which I fully enjoyed.    In short, this season is TV at its best.

030726839X|5.0|A deeply engrossing, and most revealing, account of Churchill during Great Britain's toughest hours and years. Max Hastings has accomplished a brilliant task: painting a full portrait of a complex man, using all the colors of the human palette without favoring one over the other.<br /><br />For lay Churchillian fossil hunters--eager to crack open that one rock which will reveal the perfectly defined imprint of a long-extinct species of leader, Winston's War is the ideal tool for discovery. In page after page, Hastings gives us Churchill the humanist, the warrior, the worrier, the optimist, the depressed, the badgerer and and the beguiler. But most of all, Hastings reveals as few have before, Churchill's devotion to the Great Britain that once was and, in his vision, could be again, if only his plans were properly attended to by generals and allies whose actions were otherwise limited to the near horizon of self-interest.<br /><br />The same brush that defines Churchill with such clarity and vibrance does not neglect to flesh out other characters from that era -- Roosevelt and the American chiefs of staff, and Winston's own stable of generals and advisers receive equal amounts of critical paint, and not always in pleasing hues.<br /><br />Hastings is not all laud and champagne for Churchill; Winston's War gives us a churlish Winnie, a frustrated warfighter, a spoiled child, an unthinking master, a fretful husband, and bitter father. Through Hasting's sharply focused lens of research and discovery, we watch Churchill fall victim to the duplicity of perceived friends--Beaverbrook, for one, with all his smarminess and deceit--and to seek the embrace of the spitting cobra of Stalin in order to save Poland from the fangs of Soviet domination. Just as in a horror movie in which a hapless character is about to turn a corner to face a bloodthirsty monster the audience can already see, Hastings' portrayal of the Churchill/Stalin matchup will have you screaming, \\"Run, Winston, run!\\" and yet you will be unable to stop turning the pages, just as history could not be stopped or re-directed.<br /><br />But for all his foibles and failings--and there were many--the scales of judgment must, if Hastings has it right--and I believe he does--tip easily toward a near reverence for Churchill's place in history. He was not as much a man of his time, as he was the right man for his time. An anachronism from the very start of the war, Churchill nonetheless was able to poke, prod, cajole, inspire, and lead even when so many forces--social, political, and economic--were placed in his path. As Hastings puts it, \\"He was one of the greatest actors upon the stage of affairs whom the world has ever known ... He was the largest human being ever to occupy his office.\\"be unable to stop turning the pages, just as history could not be stopped or re-directed.

As Hastings puts it, \\"He was one of the greatest actors upon the stage of affairs whom the world has ever known ... He was the largest human being ever to occupy his office.\\"
B000068CNX|5.0|This is an awesome series. This is one of the best television series I've seen of the few that are on my list. This series involves dating, love, and is a great comedy show with a set like our everyday lives. I recommend this series to everyone who enjoys watching comedy. You'll like it, I guarentee it.

B003A4IFGY|5.0|I've been a Tom Petty fan for 30 years, and not one album has ever disappointed. No, this isn't a top 40 \\"hitmaker\\" perhaps, but if your are a true fan of real music, and actual writers and performers you have to love the compassion of this band. \\"Something good coming\\" brings tears to my eyes, and \\"Don't pull me over\\" makes me smile. Job done Tom, as always...By the way, if you have ever been to a Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers concert, it will be one of the finest memories of your life, guaranteed.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This is a great television series about a doctor who loses a wife in a accident and tries to get back on his feet by moving to a different city - a non-fictional town called Everwood, Colorado - along with his son and daughter. I really recommend that you watch it. You'll be satisfied.
0966638328|5.0|I love it, I was craving for a book or some kind of information that will put together the emotional psychological feeling to reaction with colors. I've been teaching myself to be a graphic designer. This is a good guide for inexperience people. It's simple easy to read; you can use it for finding nice pantone colors combination. You can also use it for your clients if they don't have any idea where to start.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|OK, I'm an audiophile. If I am going to listen to music on a quality system, then I expect to hear quality sound. I am also retired, so I am a first time Beatles fan. So how wonderful it was for Love to be released on DVD-Audio in 24bit/96kHz high-resolution. And when the Beatles remasters were released on CDs, I thought I could sit them out - surely a high-resolution audio release would follow in the near future. But no, I couldn't sit them out, sucker that I am - one look at the packaging of the CD box sets and I was sold - I had to have both the mono and stereo releases. And they are so nice. Being a little older than 21, I have the original 1987 limited release CD box sets of all but three of the Beatles albums (of course, I have the other original CD releases, just not in a boxed set).     And do the new CDs sound better than the originals? Oh yes they do - a smoother sound, no clipping, the bass stands out more. Yes, I was chuffed with these new releases!     And then, by pure chance, I discover that there is (another) limited edition version of the stereo albums - 44.1kHz 24-bit FLAC release on a USB stick (along with some MP3s - ugh!). Only 30,000 world-wide, I'm told. Bloody Hell - can I still get one? A quick check with Amazon tells me yes. Quick, quick order it. Got it! Phew!    Will I regret this, I wonder? The MP3s are DRM free - but what about the FLACs? And is the improvement in quality over the CDs worth another few hundred dollars - after all, it's only 44.1kHz, not 192kHz, or even 96kHz, OR EVEN 48kHz! Nervous wait for transport of USB apple from US to Australia. Is it worth it?    It finally arrives. I unpack it, and the first thing I find is the metal apple's stalk is broken off (a common complaint, I have since read). Panic sets in - I can't get the USB out!!! Eventually, I sort of push the stalk back in, it holds, and I extract the USB (I fix it later with superglue). OK, off to the computer, can I read the files and copy them to my hard drive,or is some clever copyright protection present that nobody has thought to mention? I need not have worried - I can backup all the files and decompress the FLACs to WAVs. EMI ARE TO BE HEARTILY CONGRATULATED ON THEIR ENLIGHTENED APPROACH TO COPYRIGHT! THANK YOU EMI!    Right, onto the music quality. I have many DVD-Audio and SACD discs (as well as vinyl of course - again, all the original Beatles LPs). My system is capable of producing audiophile sound. If you play the Beatles FLACs (or WAVs) from your computer, make sure you have an audiophile sound card that plugs into your Home Theatre/Audio system. DON'T be content with playing the FLACs through your computer speakers (unless you have very, very good ones, or a good headset - but see my comments below on this).    I listen to a Hard Day's Night first (first folder in the Music directory). Then Help. I'm stunned! Completely blown away! I have DVD-Audio discs at 24bit/96kHz that do not sound as good as this! It just goes to show how good a properly digitally transferred master tape can sound. EMI, you are to be congratulated again. In terms of audio quality, these sound files are a world beyond the CDs: there is real depth and clarity in the voices, the harmonics, the instruments; listen to the solid beat of the drums, the thump of the bass, the twang of the lead guitars; all is just so much more real. Even with computer speakers, you will notice the difference. And you won't want to listen to the CDs (and certainly not the MP3s) ever again (good job the packaging of the CDs is nice!!!)    If you are prevaricating, don't: get in quick before these sticks are not available anymore.    Will EMI release higher-resolution versions? I hope that there will be a 24bit/192kHz blu-ray edition soon (or maybe a higher capacity USB, which is perhaps the way to go!). On the release of the remastered CDs, Paul McCartney said in Rolling Stone that there is plenty of time for high-resolution releases. Well, as I said, I'm retiredand therefore aging; so please don't wait too long - think of your original fans! Do me a favour though - go straight to 24bit/192kHz (and include the mono releases) and don't screw me with a 24bit/96kHz version first!
B000002GHH|4.0|This is indeed Hiatt's finest moment in the studio, in my opinion. He had hit a wall in his personal life, and as is the case so often, it helped produce top notch work. The playing on this album is first-rate, with Hiatt joined by the likes of Ry Cooder, Jim Keltner, and Nick Lowe. This album was on droves of \\"best of the year\\" lists, and so many fellow musicians swear by it. While Hiatt's voice may grate on many, his lyrics always hit home on Bring The Family. That said, the man is NOT Elvis Costello. I don't even care for the comparison. Hiatt will never make an 'Imperial Bedroom' or 'This Year's Model', nor will he come close to the sound of Costello's work with Burt Bacharach or Bill Frisell. They are both gifted composers, but it mostly ends there. They do have similar biting lyrics when writing about relationships and regular daily piss-offs, but that's nothing particularly unique to either of them.
B003E48AYC|1.0|I'm sure the movie is great, but I am not able to view it from this purchase because the seller did NOT include the DVD!! and that was what I had hoped to view!!!

B002RI9PKO|3.0|What is it that distinguish people that succeed so much that they can be described as outliers, someone far beyond the rest of us? Is it just that some people have so much intelligence and favourable personality traits that they are most certain to succeed? Gladwells standpoint seems to be that intelligence above a certain level is not so critical to where you go in life and that the personal and social skills one need to be really progressive in an environment is something we learn in the family we grow up. Other than that, part of the reason why some reaches the top while most others also seems to have a lot to do with lucky coincidense. Gladwell makes his point by interesting anecdotes and mention scientific work, such as Terman's study on higly gifted kids. The reason I gave only 3 stars is that many of chapters didn't seem relevant to what I thought was the main topic. Possibly the cultural background of Korean pilots is a potential risk factor for plane crashes. It makes sense that east asian students are better at math because they spend more time to study math and that the numbers are more logically spelled in chinese language, but if it is not relevant, I really don't care that much. If you are okay to just skip the less relevant half, then possibly this book is for you.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Guy Ritchie's highly-anticipated film about Sir Arthur's legendary sleuth from 221b Baker Street is nothing less than a bull's-eye saying \\"V.R.\\" My favourite tracks are \\"Psychological Recovery...6 Months,\\" \\"Catatonic,\\" \\"I Never Woke Up In Handcuffs Before,\\" \\"Marital Sabotage\\" & \\"Discombobulate\\" (featured prominently at the end of the movie).<br />However, I feel \\"Psychological Recovery...6 Months\\" was mis-named, though, as it's really the big action set-piece, which takes place during the thrilling climax of this excellent film. Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law & Rachel McAdams were perfect. Downey's English accent was spot-on, and there are references a-plenty from the stories themselves, including a famous line from William Shakespeare's \\"Henry V,\\" which was used by Sir Arthur as Holmes' catchphrase. Mark Strong was imposing and terrifying as the villain. All the while, a familiar adversary lurks in the shadows...<br />Get ready for \\"Sherlock Holmes 2,\\" combing through the clues December 16, 2011.

0811729117|4.0|I have now read a number of biographies of tank men who served in the various German tank regiments on the Eastern Front. They seem to blur into similarity and are either copying each other (which I doubt) or the battlefield was as cut-throat as they explain.<br /><br />I found this book to be a very exciting read - it carried a good supply of technical information without being burdened with nitty gritty that the amateur historian becomes quickly bored with. The book reinforced the terrible state of command and supply that plagued the German military due to the leadership structures employed by Hitler and mimicked all the way down. I often found myself putting the book down and daydreaming about what might have become of Germany's war effort had it not been beset by bad decision making (Goering's debacle of the Battle of Britain, continuing with Operation Barbarossa after the delays in Yugoslavia & Greece, the delay of releasing the Me262 as a mainland interceptor, pursuing a multiplicity of over-engineered battle tanks instead of sticking with one powerful yet quickly manufactured tank - maybe an upgraded MkIV - which would have lead to dozens of spares all over the various battlefields).<br /><br />I was particularly excited about the battles of the retreating Army Group North around Narva etc.<br /><br />Two reservations that I was a little disappointed with - firstly, the author's stance that the war's prosecution was correct as a method of keeping Europe from Communism. Very little was mentioned about Poland, Lebensraum and the Holocaust despite the author obviously being aware. Secondly, the couple of final chapters that focussed on the author's time in the Western Front in the King Tigers appeared disjointed and abrupt. It may have been so because his joining of the battle was during the closing of the Ruhr Pocket.<br /><br />I was not disappointed with this book OVERALL - enjoyed it immensely...
B001FB5634|3.0|After I first read Cormac McCarthy's novel on which this film is based I concluded that it was a good read, worthy of all the hype. I then had occasion to read it again a couple of years later and remember wondering as I revisited it what exactly it had been that I liked about the book. It's so bleak, so dark. I wondered until I got to the end. The conclusion makes it all worth while. It's the same with the movie. Of course, I'm not going to tell you how it ends, although I was still overwhelmed by the conclusion after knowing quite well what would happen.    It's the story of a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his young son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who struggle to survive in a (as that strange phrase goes) \\"post-apocalyptic world.\\" There have been several Hollywood productions on this theme. It seems the end of the world tends to bring out the worst in folks. Their animal natures prevail. They just aren't nice.    The film does not approach the artistry of the book. However, the cinematography is strong, capturing a grey, ash-filled world littered with the rusting and rotting remains of civilization. But there was something forced about the acting. Smit-McPhee's performance was astonishingly dull until he came through in the last segment. I think Mortensen went too far trying to be an Everyman who was overwhelmed by it all. It seemed to me that he was overwhelmed by his role. I think more interaction with the scattered survivors that the pair encountered would have helped. Maybe a little suspense. A dash of humor. That sort of thing.
0060012358|5.0|I'd love to live in a world where cats and rats talked, although around here they'd probably only say things like, \\"Not dry food again,\\" or \\"Don't touch that piece of cheese.\\" However, in the middle school book by Terry Pratchett, The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents, a cat and a group of rats can not only talk, but they plot, scheme, and foil evildoers.<br /><br />Pratchett, the author of this children's story (that adults will love too), tells a lively, humorous tale starring Maurice, a scruffy con artist of a cat; Dangerous Beans, a thoughtful albino rat who ponders the meaning of their newfound intelligence; Darktan, a streetwise rat bristling with derring-do; and Peaches, a female rat who is the conscience of the group. Many other rats have walk-on parts. Two humans appear in supporting roles: Keith, a quiet boy who plays musical instruments, and Malicia, the Mayor's daughter, who tries to make everything that happens turn out like a story in a book.<br /><br />As the story opens, Maurice and the rats arrive at a new town and the cat convinces the rats to pull the same trick they've used in other towns: the rats will invade all the homes and swim in the cream, widdle on the muffins, and generally make nuisances of themselves. Then Maurice will negotiate a fee with the town Mayor for removing the rats. When the fee has been paid, Keith will play a flute and \\"lure\\" the rats out of town. But the scheme goes wrong when the Maurice and the others discover that the local rat catchers are up to no good and that deep beneath the town lives a mysterious something that has the power to control minds.<br /><br />This book for middle school readers has as many twists and turns as the dark, creepy tunnels beneath the town where it is set. The dialogue is witty and I laughed out loud many times. I found some scenes touching as well--who knew I would care what happens to rats? The plot is like a good soup--it keeps thickening; new threats keep popping up to make things worse. Danger and death lurk around every corner and even wily, selfish Maurice the cat rises to heroism.ath lurk around every corner and even wily, selfish Maurice the cat rises to heroism.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since I was in Jr. High back in the mid 80's.  As I became older, I realized what a powerhouse of talent these guys are.  This documentary is well put together, and despite what others have said....it does not seem rushed to me.  It tracks the band back to friendships that started before the music.  I found it very interesting and all in all a touching story about a group of good friends who have shared the struggles, highs, tragedies, success and fame while making some of the most complex progressive rock music in history.      All three seem to be just simple good guys, and that really comes through in this story.  Awesome music and a real \\"suck it\\" to the industry that didn't really want them to succeed.      Great....just great.
B003405MF6|4.0|Every track on this CD was a surprise - a different sound, a different genre, a different cover.  I particularly loved the endearing cover of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and the cover of the old Screaming Jay Hawkins tune \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" is really quite good.  This CD is truly soulful, entertaining and befitting a great guitarist from those early days of the Yardbirds.  This deserves to be in anyone's collection.
B003INBNXO|5.0|The first time i was introduce to donnie yen, was in a martial arts film entitled \\"iron monkey\\", and ever since that film, i wanted more from this guy, so i immediately went out and purchased all of his past films including his debut drunken tai chi, now although they were low budget, i didnt care. I was not surprised on how successful ip man was when it was released in hong kong december of 2008 . The fight scenes are extremely well done as well as the story. The fight scene that took my breath away, was when yen's character faced off against 10 japanese karate masters,veeeeeeeeery brutal and i loved every minute of it. To make a long story short, ip man is (hands down) the best wing chun film ever made. Move aside jet and jackie, it's donnie's time to shine.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I can't say enough about how much i LOVE this album.  It's one of the best albums I've heard in a long time and it's rare when I love every song.  She's a force to be reckoned with and I am a huge huge fan now.  It's so eclectic and interesting.  She can't be put into any one category, she's just Janelle Monae, an amazing singer, songwriter, performer that can literally sing any type of genre.
B003L16FAE|4.0|I have both Blu-ray releases now and just finished watching the Ultimate Hunter edition. I understand some of the criticisms, but overall I'm happy with the restoration done on this movie. Color correction makes a big difference in the consistency of the video presentation here, and the sound quality is excellent. Grain is all but gone, which for me isn't distracting unless you're intentionally comparing the two blu-ray releases instead of watching the movie for enjoyment.    My (likely unpopular) opinion is this is a good restoration of an older film.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Alright guys, it's official- animation delivers the laughs better than *any* other style of comedy.  This includes stand up routines, sitcoms with live studio audiences, or just your uncle Bob telling you a joke during a family visit.  Kung Fu Panda absolutely rules, and the animation is one of the main reasons why.    I've actually wanted to watch Kung Fu Panda for quite a while now.  I finally got the chance to watch it this afternoon.  It certainly lived up to all the hype it received a couple years ago.    What makes it so enjoyable is the fact that the laughs aren't the only exciting thing about Kung Fu Panda- it's the outrageous and zanny action segments that really elevate this film to a level of untouchable greatness.  We're talking a LOT of animated action here, folks.      The storyline is about a panda bear that's severely out of shape but dreams about becoming the ultimate master of kung fu fighting.      Eventually he's chosen to be given such a chance, with lots of special attention and guidance from his master (along with other friends).  Unfortunately his laziness constantly prevents him from ever reaching his dream... until a really evil wild cat comes into the equation and pretty much forces the panda bear to stand up and fight.      I don't know what's most awesome about Kung Fu Panda- the exciting action and fighting segments, the actual humor and jokes involving all the animated animals communicating with each other, or just the brilliantly executed animation frames themselves.      One thing's for sure- you simply MUST watch this movie.  Adults and children alike must watch it.  You'll be laughing hard and heavy, I guarantee it!
B000000OE7|5.0|His voice brings such feelings of joy and sadness all at the same time  He sings as no one has before him or since he passed.  This CD had some things I didn't have in my Freddie Mercury collection so it was a welcome addition.  It was reasonably priced and I love every piece of music on it.  If you are a Queen or Freddie fan buy it you'll like it!
B003VGD340|4.0|Back in the day we saw Peter Davidson's Doctor play Cricket.  In this episode The Doctor partakes of another British pastime, Football.  How many fans out there were waiting for that?<br />With Amy trapped in an out of control Tardis, The Doctor races to solve the mystery of the man upstairs.  Popping down to the park for a match, spending a day at the office, chatting with the cat, and bringing out the best in the average human along the way.<br />I like this Doctor.  Matt Smith does a good job of using the great age of the character to shore up youthful brash bravado.  This combination of aged wisdom and cynicism balanced with youthful faith and idealism is interesting.  It's really good to see this incarnation of The Doctor acknowledging and owning the deep roots of the show.  Most all the episodes this season have been fun rides and visual treats.  The new Tardis is brilliant.  The Doctor has always had solid stories and weighty reflections.  Now with the budget and special effects to spice it up, it's all good.<br />Looking forward to the Pandorica opening.  Wondered if we'll ever see The Dream Master again...
B003VGD340|5.0|i subscribed to this so i don't miss any episodes.<br />the doctor has to pass himself off as a human but along the way he makes friends, plays football (soccer for you Americans), heals his flat mate, talks to a cat, and brings two lover together all with having to solve the problems with the tardis and a mysterious being up stairs!
B001SGEUMY|4.0|Is it just me or did Oasis just keep getting better and better? I always thought the first two albums were a lit...tle....bit overrated, to be honest. I liked them initially but the poor audio and the hype was just too much. Other than Champaign Supernova, of course. Then they unleashed Heathen Chemistry and Don't Believe the Truth. I just finished listening to both for the first time. Like any Oasis album, they are spotty. But the high points are so darn good. I don't know why people dissed these guys after WTSMG. This is extremely high quality MODERN pop. I promise you will not walk away from either not wanting to hit replay. I know... I was surprised too.
B00192IV0O|1.0|Wow, this is a bunch of crap, these are some of the childish lyrics i have heard. all i heard while listening to this cd was mindless rap music with dance infused into it.    I am so glad i didn't but this, I will be returning it to my friend who probably won't want it back either cause this is just some bull*****    The only song that had any descent anything was \\"Meet Me Halfway\\". other than that it was just was a complete waste of my time and an hour i will never get back
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Its a great movie and a good deal. Almost 4 cds just for a few bucks. And the digital copy is great.    The delivery was really really fast!

B0000041ZT|5.0|Great product and great delivery!! Im in Perú and the item was delivered really fast.
B000ICLRHK|5.0|I'm not going to dwell much on the storyline or characters.  I just want to say that this is one nail-biter right from the opening scene and is so much fun to watch.  Sure it makes no sense if you're talking about something like this happening in real life (well maybe it does, but the bus would have exploded early on in its journey) but for entertainment value, this movie is way up there on the scale. Dennis Hopper was a wonderful villain and the characters are very likable.    I want to give thumbs way up for the audio portion of the Blu Ray - turn up the sound when you are watching this because the quality is truly stunning. Very realistic, nothing exaggerated. Dialog is clear and the movie makes good use of a surround system.  The video is good, considering the age of the movie. The audio is just plain excellent.
0802473156|5.0|This book was recommended while watching Christian Carter's \\"From Casual to Committed\\".  I very much enjoyed this book and found all of the information useful.  Being recently divorced I could relate to several stories and examples within.  I recommend to anyone that has lost hope in men and women getting along.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Rush is probably the most private band I know of and it's great to get a look into how they were formed and the trials that they went through.  I am a Rush fan and have been since high school (that's about 23 years ago now), this is a MUST HAVE item if you are a fan and a definite watch if you are a music lover.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I read all the reviews and was on the fence about buying these because of the reported popping noises. When i first bought it i had it right next to my router and heard some occasional popping noises. I removed the router and now it works absolutely perfectly. When the battery dies the unit just shuts off, i have not experienced any deafening loud screeching noises that others have complained about. Once you start using these there is absolutely no going back. you can hear everything in the games and the bass boost is a nice touch when listening to music on your xbox. i'm absolutely in love with these things. the mic is great because it plays your voice back to you so you know other can hear you. i hear everyone on xbox and everyone can hear me (and i know they hear me because i can hear my own voice). can't say enough about these things. they eat through batteries so buy some rechargeable AAA batteries with these and you'll be set. worth every penny.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Haunting; hell yes! Troubling; damn straight! Revealing; you bet! You don't have to be of Germanic descent as I am to see a bit of your childhood in this excellent movie. I have already watched twice. The second time I examined it in depth often stopping the movie and going back to replay scenes to grasp the meaning I may have missed. The messages and plot became clearer the second time. It is a movie that demands your full attention and deserves to be watched more than once. I will watch it again!  I highly recommend this film by Michael Haneke. My only problem was that I did not learn German from my father and the English subtitles were at times difficult to read.
0143118420|1.0|No matter how hard I tried, I could not get through this book.  I finally threw it away after getting halfway.  I hate that I wasted the money.  I purchased it because there was so much hype surrounding it.  I did feel better, however, when I discovered how many people I knew who had also tossed the book after only partially reading it.  How so many women can say it is their \\"bible\\" is completely beyond me.
B000W74EQC|4.0|I am one that has never read the Harry Potter books, but really did enjoy this movie. I wouldn't say that it is amazing, but it does appeal to all ages. The story is really good, but the CGI used in the movie is a little dated. There are scenes when you can tell that it is computer animated because the characters look like something from a video game. Not really used to seeing a movie when they use CG for the actors and it is slowed down enough where you get a good look and are able to tell the actor fake. It just takes away from the movie a little.
B001HN694K|4.0|I loved the movie, Alice In Wonderland. The cast, especially Johnny Depp were fantastic, the scenery beautiful. This was my first order through Amazon.com and the movie arrived quickly and in perfect order. Thanks.

B003I6473E|4.0|This is a great CD, but there are a lot of songs about sex. Therefore I don't think young teens should get it even though it is the edited version.  The songs are obvious even without certain words...my 9 year old would understand what she is singing about (which would make both of us blush).  I love the album and will just listen to it without the kids around.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|The best AMD processor you can buy and a super price!<br />Forget Intel this is best for your money! AMD a success
B002JODV3S|4.0|First off, I need to tell you what makes this such a magical experience. I can't call it a \\"product\\" since there's too much emotion involved. The experience of Where the Wild Things Are is personal. Steve puts a lot of himself into the show and the editing of the material, but he also showcases his band members very well. You get a small glimpse into the characters of each member, especially through the band material. There's several interesting stories and personalities for you to better understand that will want you to watch this back-to-back. My favorite band member (other than Steve) would have to be the drummer, simply for his spiritual (and surprisingly mellow-dramatic) outlook on his place in the band.<br /><br />Besides the strong emotional content, the visuals (edited or not) are very reflective of Steve, and Steve only. Some people may not like his over the top effects added to some parts of the show, but I'm sure if he had a way to integrate those visuals into a live show, he would do so. Take the editing for what it is.<br /><br />Still, there's the reason why I gave this four stars instead of five. Simply put, this is 720p rather than 1080p, and the cameras sometimes don't seem up to par with today's high definition look. While this doesn't take away from the experience all that much, I just expected a bit more polish. The DVD version is only two dollars less at the submission of this review, so it's not a real issue of what's worth the money.
B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|Great design, as it never gets in the way of lap swimming, and actually encourages you to put your head down further.  The one downside is that the straps don't stay tightened - they loosen (both of them) as you swim.  That said, it is still a nice product and I would not go back to a regular side-snorkle.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|I love this new album from Jack Johnson. It's like he crawled to the sea, reinvented himself and crawled back to us with a truer purer sound. Love his new direction and flavor and it feels a lot more real and sounds like he's found his voice. Love it!!
B003HLM2QO|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS VERY ROCKIN I THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T BE AS GOOD WITH A DIFFERENT GUITARIST BUT IT REALLY ROCKS!!!!!!I'D SUGGEST BUYING IT IF YOUR INTO SOME KILLER OZZY OSBOURNE SONGS!!!!!!!!!
B003MX5P20|5.0|I was a little concerned that Enrique with his new album would be stale or stagnate, but boy to my pleasant surprise he just keeps getting better. Euphoria will leave you feeling euphoric! The voice, the music and the moves make this one all around perfection! You want to own this one.
0307454541|5.0|If you don't like this book you are missing either a soul or a brain. Or maybe a pulse. This is a genre book that transcends the genre without trying or caring if it does. It is about sex crime and financial crime, also hackers and journalists and serial killers. It is both preachy and unpretentious. Larson presents issues in black and white then muddies them beyond recognition.<br /><br />The back story of the author, who according to the legend, delivered the three volumes of the trilogy and then died before he could reap the fame and the money of his creation adds to the experience.<br /><br />The details of the plot have been repeated in the thousand other reviews up here. But this is also a great immersion in Sweeden and Sweedish culture. These people drink gallons of coffee and something called Aquavit. But they also eat McDonald and buy Apple computers to be cool. Some apparently have torture chambers hidden below their homes. In end they are mostly like everyone else on the planet, but the experience of this book is absolutely singular.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I didn't think it could get better than this cd. I just gave a review of Euphoria and in the years in between Escape he's gotten even better. But still Escape is what started it all for me and this album is to melt for. Enrique is authentic and the naturalness of his talent and his cultural heritage are all here for our enjoyment. Wonderful!
B0035XVVDY|2.0|The first half of the movie was pretty good and had an interesting premise. However it got very unrealistic towards the end...

0385340540|1.0|Except for the descriptions of the places in Italy inhabited briefly by his main character in this tiresome novel, John Grisham's The Broker has very little of interest to offer even the most undemanding reader.  The characters are so poorly defined the reader has no interest in the outcome of the story.  The plot has possibilities but they are not explored leaving the reader completely disinterested in the story.   It seems Grisham has devised a formula for spewing out commercially feasible work and has been resting on past success far too long.  I will not spend money or time in future on anything from this author.

1439102813|5.0|I read this book in one day. It was so interesting the way the story was told from the perspective of the person with Alzheimers. Every caregiver should read this book to help them understand what their spouse, relative or friend may be feeling as they cope with this disease. I know the book is fictional but it really addresses the fears and stress of this disease. How to tell family and friends, when to tell, all the hard questions. I highly recommend this book. I have started reading anything & everything on Alzheimers and share what I know with family and friends affected by this disease.
B003KRJNBW|1.0|Wow! i think words are not enough to describe the disgrace of movies like this one.<br />Corny ,banal,  commonplace, clich&eacute;d, predictable, hoary, stereotyped, platitudinous, tired, stale, overworked, overused, cheesy, sloppy, soppy, cornball, hokey.<br />Definitely one  of the worst movies ever.<br />Watch \\" The road\\" if you  truly want to be inspired.
1840220554|5.0|I found it very convenient to have all the novels of Jane Austen in one book. The print isn't so small that you can't see them and the book is sturdy so I don't have to worry about it falling apart from opening it so much. I've reallly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone looking for Miss Austen's complete works. Amazon Rocks!

0891419063|5.0|Great story - can't recommend it more highly.  I already had the greatest respect for the Marines who fought in the Pacific, and this just confirms and reinforces it.
0307454541|3.0|I bought this book because it got such great reviews.  I did think it was well written, and well paced.  In particular, I think the main characters are very well drawn, three dimensional, and complex.  I feel a Hollywood movie coming on, although my guess is that the character of Salander will be sadly watered down.<br /><br />The main reason I am writing this review is to warn about the truly gruesome nature of some of the content.  Whilst I understand that this is a book about a serial killer, the descriptions of the murders, incest, and child abuse was I felt too gratuitously over the top.  Fortunately I managed to read the book before my fourteen year old got it.<br /><br />So, overall well written but not for the squeamish.

1439102813|5.0|\\"This is a phenomenal book,\\" my friend Kay said as she loaned it to me. \\"Oh, good,\\" I said. \\"What's it about?\\" \\"Well, it's about a woman with early onset Alzheimer's.\\" She paused, knowing how unappealing that must have sounded. \\"I promise you, it's worth reading.\\"<br /><br />If ANYONE else but this particular friend had said that, I would have passed on it, imagining that they just liked tear-jerkers and emotionally heavy books (I usually don't). Thank goodness I read it. It's a book that changes you, makes you more compassionate for the issues facing everyone in the family of an Alzheimer's patient, makes you more grateful for every healthy day you have, and inspires you to believe that you could, as this family in the story did, navigate the rough shoals of a dementia-like disease with love as the only guide. While heartbreaking, this story is strangely uplifting, and I believe it is an enormously important contribution to the public's understanding and awareness of this disease. Never again will I avoid interacting with someone I know who suffers from dementia.<br /><br />Dr. Alice Howland, 50 years old, is a cognitive linguistics professor at Harvard and a world expert in linguistics. She dismisses her initial memory lapses until the day she gets lost a few blocks from her home on a run that she has taken daily for years. The reader is taken into the surreal world of her initial awareness and analysis, through the trials and fears of seeking help and diagnosis, into the reactions of her successful husband and two grown daughters, and on to the fascinating and excruciating unraveling of life as she knew it, while hanging on desperately to what it is that makes her \\"Still Alice.\\" Besides the author's masterful depiction of Alice's experience, she is gives us an extremely compassionate appreciation for the husband and daughters' viewpoints and emotional reactions to the disease and to Alice's increasingly unpredictable behavior.<br /><br />The author is herself a Harvard neuroscientist and online columnist for the National Alzheimer's Association. The testimonials from professionals and volunteers who work in the field of Alzheimer's treatment and research are proof that she \\"got it right.\\"<br /><br />I agree with the back-cover quote from a Boston Globe critic named Beverly Beckham: \\"After I read Still Alice, I wanted to stand up and tell a train full of strangers, 'You have to get this book.'\\"nd online columnist for the National Alzheimer's Association.

B00005V9IL|3.0|This was the only James Cameron film I had yet to see. So I took the plunge and watched it.<br /><br />I must say I certainly think this is the worst JC film I have seen.<br /><br />The film is very ambitious and was one of the most difficult films to shoot because most of the scenes were shot underwater. Allegedly, James Cameron had multiple spats with both his crew and cast members over the brutally physicaly and emotionaly difficult scenes.<br /><br />There were times when the film seems to be lacking direction. Many minutes are wasted meandering with dialogue and sequences that seem add little value to the overall story and character development.<br /><br />The film is also somewhat anti-military and certainly anti-nuclear weapons.<br /><br />I would actually like to see this film REDONE by JC with modern special effects and a bigger budget. Perhaps this film was made before its time.<br /><br />The acting in this film was great. I think JC does a good job of bringing out the best in actors and actresses.<br /><br />Overall, I was bored with this film and really didn't care for the characters or their outcome.
0679411585|5.0|This book is co-authored by the Colonel in command of the battalion engaged in this pivotal action early in the Vietnamise War. It is authentic and very descriptive of that action, the events surrounding it and the effect it had on future actions. It is particularly attentive to the individual human aspects of the events both during the battle and on the home front. The other co-author provides the touch and thoroughness of a professional writer. Inputs from North Vietnamise commanders, during the action, documented the events from the oponents perspective.    It is an excellant book.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|Forgive me, but the debate over the merits of the 1994 remaster over this one is a doofus debate. The sound cognoscenti and rabid fans alike have been blasting this 2006 issue for all sorts of enormously important reasons, from the fact that Crosby's two seconds of personal fun at the end of \\"Long Time Gone\\" (he croons, in a somewhat comedic voice, \\"You better come to my kitchen, 'cause it's soon gonna be rainin' outside\\") have been cut to the fact that the image of Dallas Taylor has been Photoshopped-out from the artwork, to supposedly compromised highs on the equalizer frequencies. This is the sort of bickering that spoiled children indulge in when they've had too many goodies to enjoy. The very first CD was actually perfectly nice, and whatever it's (microscopic) shortcomings in terms of modern mastering, it preserved the core of the music: the glorious harmonies, the cool, cathedral-like atmosphere of Wooden Ships (I'm calling it \\"cathedral\\" because certain types of echo effects are called that on mastering machines), and so on. If you have it, you might as well keep it. If you don't, buy this issue, the 2006 one. I can't imagine that you could possibly regret it. I see that at least one reviewer was so disgusted with it that he actually gave it away, which boggles the mind. This is a fine remastering, and, if nothing else, it finally does away with 99% of the \\"rip\\" that is heard at the beginning of \\"Long Time Gone,\\" which the 1994 remaster actually emphasized. It sounds exactly like a needle scratch on a good old LP, which may have been placed there by superior intelligences from outer space to warn those who are now suddenly advocates of vinyl that this is definitely one of the options that awaits them (lol). And while my own ears prefer the ever-so-slightly subdued vocals in some places on the 2006 issue compared to a bit too much screaming on the 1994, that too is a minor thing, and if you already have the 1994, it will do as well. I'm just trying to tell you not to waste your money on every single new remaster out there because you'll go broke for nothing, or, at best, for very little.   Finally, I agree with the malcontents that the bonus material isn't all brilliant, but it's not without charm either, and Stills's beautiful rendition of \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" alone is worth the price of admission. I never paid much attention to this pop ditty back when it was a huge hit for Nilsson, but in this interpretation it is no longer a pop ditty. It has acquired nearly tragic depth and sounds imbued with experience. Terrific.
1423113381|3.0|Okay, so  I tried really hard not to make comparisons to the Lightning Thief.  The Percy Jackson series is probably my favorite in children's literature, so I knew this one would have a tough time living up to my expectations.  Unfortunately, the author invites comparisons right and left because he is essentially telling the same story, just plugging in Egyptian gods instead of Greek.  I must admit to being a bit disappointed.  The characters of Sadie and Carter were not as interesting or as well developed as Percy, and I found the author's technique of switching back and forth between narrators only added to the confusion already present in the book.<br /><br />In the Percy Jackson series, the author spent a bit of time letting us get to know Pecy, his mates at Camp Half Blood, and even the Greek Gods.  They were each well developed characters, which made the drama all the more intense.  In this instance, since we never really get to know anybody, all the action seems just a bit tiresome.  One notable exception is Bast, who I felt the author took great pains to develop and present in such a way to make her compelling.  I found myself caring more about her than anyone else in the book, which was rather odd...<br /><br />All of the Egyptian mythology is very interesting and I enjoyed learning more about Ra and some of his friends.  The Egyptian myths are much more confusing than the Greek, because of the use of hosts, so it's easy to get turned around in some of their stories.  Some of the problems I found in the book aren't really going to matter to most kids.  They will read this book and be hooked from page 1 to the end by the non stop action.  As an adult reader, I had a hard time finishing the thing, because there were essentially no surprises.  I felt that even the humor seemed a bit forced. This one was not a success for me, but then again, what do I know?  I'm not in that magical 10-15 year old age bracket, and I think those kids will find this one just as entertaining as Percy and will probably learn a lot of mythology along the way.  You can't beat that.Percy and will probably learn a lot of mythology along the way.  You can't beat that.
B00005176F|5.0|Back in the 90's it was Blur or Oasis and I followed Oasis, so I never really listened to Blur. So I don't know why I bought this in the 1st place! But I glad I did. The song's are well written, sound brilliant and define Brit Pop to a tee. I won't reel of the songs because you can see them yourself and if you don't know them already. Just trust me they are all classics and you will probably know them as soon as you play them. This is a true Greatest Hit's, with no weak songs. Brit Pop fans, Indie fans, Pop fans, all Music fans buy this you will enjoy this.
0143118420|1.0|It's just terrible. It's not a good travel book, romance, or serious religious inquiry. It's what you expect if one of the \\"Real Housewives of New Jersey\\" got kicked off the show, and took her paychecks off to \\"find herself\\", only she took most of New Jersey with her.    The author should be ashamed. What's worse, she probably isn't.
B002PAQETY|5.0|Every stereophonics album is different and this another one of those good albums from the stereophonics. Lot's off brilliant songs on this like innocent, 100 mph, could you be the one, live 'n' love and beerbottle are brilliant. The album is a combination of brilliant accoustic style songs and brilliant rock songs. You won't be disappointed with this album.
0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis is undoubtedly one of my favorite writers. He has a knack for storytelling that makes sometimes complex material or complicated situations universally accessible. And while getting to the bottom of the cause of--and, in turn, the solution to--the most recent economic crisis requires a comprehensive assessment of the habits, the regulations, and the tools employed by the financial industry, this book does a wonderful job of following a cadre of investors that saw the inherent flaws in the system and wagered correctly. This is certainly the first book related to finance/economics that I had a hard time putting down.
B00062IDCO|5.0|A brilliant series from a brilliant programme like any series this long your bound to get the odd bad/ok ones but as a whole it 's a very good series. The characters of the Doctor and 7 of 9 become more intresting, some of the most intresting/well written episodes are in the series. It's really good series and a must buy.
1400032717|2.0|The author sussefully captured how an autistic person might think, but I still really didn't like the book. In the beginning, the main character was happy with his life. After the events in the book, it becomes evedent that the main character won't ever be happy with his life again. A book should be about growth, and I fell the character does the opposite.
0767824571|5.0|Out of the 4 Monty Python films there is only 2 worth watching, this and the Life of Brian. It has the combination of the Monty Python randomness, the best bits of there comedy, a great adventure and a good story line. A very funny comedy.<br />If you like random/odd endings (especally Monty Python endings) then you will love this ending, if not you will probably hate the ending. But don't let you think this is a bad film it has laugh's all the way through and is one of the great comedy's of all time if not one of the top ten films of all time. If you like to laugh just buy it.
B003J27WFW|5.0|This film is a fitting tribute to a consistently underrated band. I particularly liked the fact that the filmmakers explicitly confront and defy the band's critics. Frankly, I have yet to understand what it is that these critics know or can do: they can't think, they can't write, and they certainly don't seem to know (or care) very much about music. To expect them to make music is apparently to set the bar too high, but that hasn't prevented them from having a \\"highbrow\\" self-conception that permits them to use the word \\"middlebrow\\" about Rush as an insult.     It's sad when so-called music critics are disappointed in a rock documentary because it lacks the elements of a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" soap opera--a consistent theme in recent reviews of this film. Sorry to disappoint, but \\"Beyond the Lighted Stage\\" is not about drug/alcohol addiction (or recovery), orgies or groupies, serial marriages/divorces, trashed hotel rooms, criminal hijinks, backward Satanic messages, or dysfunctional relationships presided over by overpaid and incompetent therapists. (Believe it or not, prurience is not the royal road to insight.) It's a film about musicians and the music they've made, precisely the subjects our mainstream commentariat is least qualified to discuss. But as South Park's Matt Stone says in the film, the anti-Rush blather that might have seemed cool and sophisticated 20 years ago--when the bulk of Rush's fan base was in its teens--now comes across as petulant, pathetic, and pretty obviously an act. There are many purely positive elements to this film, but I was glad to see that the film retains its polemical edge, and that it goes out of its way to slap the critics' faces. Those faces have needed slapping for 30+ years, and it's about time someone did the job. Much appreciated.
1559409010|5.0|This film is off the best films of all time and probably, defiantly the greatest comedy films of all times (the only one near is Monty Python and the Holy Grail).<br />This has a great story line which makes a change for a comedy film. There are laughs everywhere and you will be quoting lines to people for ever. This film takes you in and you won't be able to stop watching it and you will keep watching it again and again so you will get your money's worth out of having a DVD of it.<br />It hasn't got as much randomness or catoons as Monty Python and the Holy Grail which will make it better for the none Monty Python fan.<br />This has film is a must have, good script, good story line, brilliant acting, lots of laughs and is a must have because it has everything you want from a film.
B0000AK7AC|5.0|My grandaughter loved this movie and we have watched it several times now!
B00005QGAX|5.0|What ever you think of Michael Jackson as a person, when ever you come to his music it's amazing and this album somes that up. Full of classics and brillilant and diffrent songs. You all probably know the top ones like Smooth Criminal (one of the nest songs ever), Bad and Dirty Diana. But one that stands out that probably dosn't get enough play time Liberian Girl. This is not far off a Greatest Hits, 8 songs are classics the other 3 are still good songs. A few nice extra's but the orginal songs of the album are main reason to get. A must have album.
B003RHCS2Q|1.0|I really enjoyed the various incarnations of Stargate-until SGU.  I hate to say it but SGU is just plain boring.  The plots are sadly lacking and there is just no chemistry.  The actors do a good job with what they have to work with but it is just not enough.  I watched eight episodes hoping it would get interesting before I gave up.  I wouldn't buy this series in any form no matter how cheap they offered it.
B000068QY7|5.0|There will be arguments of which Oasis album is best but this is in the top 3 (fact), In my opinion 2nd. With great songs like little by little, Stop crying your heart out, she is love and songbird as well as quite a few other good songs, you can't go wrong it's a brilliant album
B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|Keane gets quite derided here, and after listening to this EP for about the 50th time now I can only imagine it's because of a tendency to focus on the surface and some of the obvious jolting novelties which are more the product of the freewheeling context of making a travelogue EP as an experimental margin-dwelling bridge into the future. Many of these criticisms seem to be overlooking the more important things like the actual message the band continues to broadcast to ears hungry for music with meaning. In this regard, Keane clearly exhibits more brilliant, brave, forward-thinking philosophy infused with a lyrical and emotional viscosity that is sublime, cathartic, skeptimystic, and existentially nourishing. Don't let the startling face-value of \\"Stop\\" and \\"Looking Back\\" with K'naan's playful rap overshadow the piercing sentiment underlying these tracks that is so germane to navigating the directionless distraction factory of today. \\"Shine a Light\\" certainly stands to be seen as one of the very best songs ever by Keane, one I believe will be considered a timeless classic for many years to come. \\"Your Love\\" is another that will work it's way into your heart and brain and there it shall no doubt remain. What a joy to discover Tim the singer. I can only look forward to more. \\"Clear Skies\\" as well is not only sonically beautiful but a vessel for a real point of view. So with this said, I invite you to take a deeper listen. Night Train may at first seem candy-coated and fleeting but upon reflection and closer examination, there's a rich thick rewarding feast at its center.
B000025XX0|5.0|Just as good as Greatest Hits I but different. I prefer Greatest Hits I but it's still brilliant and probably one of the only groups who could do two Greatest Hits of this high standard. Even if you don't know the names of the songs, you will know them when you listen to it and if you still don't reconise them you will be humming, singing, jumping around or tapping your feet along, because they are all brilliant songs. I must have in any collection (but I would get it in the Platinum collection with Greatest Hits I and III if you havn't got Greatest Hits I already)
B000002L61|4.0|After the great \\"Holy Diver,\\" Dio came back with another hard rocking album. However, it was a minor case of the sophomore slumps. After all, there's only so many times you can use the words fire and rainbow before you're making albums that turn into drinking games.<br /><br />But the heavy riffing, courtesy of Vivian Campbell, still pulverizes with the best of 80's metal, and the title track rocked a great video. There's the super-speed metal of \\"I Speed At Night\\" and the epic riff that carries \\"Egypt.\\" The band had added a keyboardist and he added to the band's sound, beefing up the title track and turning a good hook in \\"Mystery,\\" the obvious sounding single.<br /><br />The single may be the most easy-to-catch evidence that Dio always had a way with melody that the metal often disguised. It's what distinguished \\"Holy Diver\\" and \\"The Lest In Line\\" (but started to overwhelm by \\"Sacred Heart\\") from run of the mill 80's hard rockers.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I bought this album for one song (this is the love) with some left over vouchers and wasn't expecting to listen to the rest of the songs, but once I had listened to the whole album I was hoocked. With great songs like Dogs Day Is Over, Kiss With A Fist, Drumming song, Hurricane Drink and of course This Is The Love as the stand out tracks as well as lots of other brilliant songs, it makes it the best of 2009 and the best album for a long time (half a decade or more).<br />A must have.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|forget the song \\"tightrope\\" that gets radio play....its put out front on her myspace too for promotional reasons, but the album really starts with \\"suite II\\".  Go start it up, and don't skip a song.  I think it'll be one of the best music listening experiences you've had in a long time.  Then come back here and buy it...it will only grow on you.    After a few days of regularly playing a lot of the songs, i realized i loved the whole album.  Then after listening to it all the way through upon this realization, i realized that this is one of my favorite albums of all time. This album will always be in my life from now on.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Ok this misses out some of the good No2's and lower Poisitioned songs, Sgt Pepper, Lucy in the sky with diamonds and I'am the Walrus for example. But you can't complain because all these songs are brilliant and thats all I need to say because I leave this album, to go by the bands reputation
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Nancy in Seattle, WA  :  This has been a very satifying series.  My great regret is that Stieg Larsson will not be writing any further tales of government corruption and malfeasence.
B00006JIA4|5.0|This all the music you will ever need, Greatest Hits I (the best) and II and epics (a word over used but not on this ocassion). As for Greatest Hits III most of it is good/amazing Barcelona, Driven by you, too much love will kill you (some of the amazing). But Another One Bites The Dust with Wyclef Jean is a bit pants and lets it down as well as a couple others. But as it goes Greatest III is a good addition to the other 2 Brilliant, Greatest Hits.<br />This has practually everything a you need if you want to the listen to Queen and you need any other Queen CD after this.<br />As for Queen they have produced some of the best and well known music off all time and it's all here. You won't be dissappointed with Queen or this collection.
0802714544|5.0|The spy games portrayed in this book are not like James Bond. There are no card games or cocktail parties, and no novel weapons and fancy gadgets. Instead, there are intelligent people playing mind games with each other, each only knowing a part of the whole story.<br /><br />The common theme throughout this book is that in the world of espionage, the ends justify the means. That ideals are an unnecessary burden that must be discarded in order to succeed. This message has just as much relevance today as it did when it was written; it's an interesting exercise to imagine this taking place with modern day terrorists rather than East Germans.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for pulse-pounding action, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a fast, gripping read that makes you think, this book is for you.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It took me ages to see what the hype was about and I wasn't disappointed. It would have been nice to see what it was like before it was remastered but in the end I was really happy with the film, it is a classic.<br />It's not very often that trilogy's work (i.e. the other trilogy) but this does. There is everything you want to in a film, forget it's a sci-fi and enjoy the story.
0694003611|5.0|I have purchased this book time and time again as a baby shower gift.  It is a classic book that I love to share and give as a gift.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|After I rented this movie, I decided that it was a keeper.  First of all I am from the generation that can truly relate to the music and the times of the sixties so it might have less appeal for someone younger or older.  The Beatles music is very well used to tell the story, and I love the way it was sung.  The music and the dialog are seamlessly intertwined so that you wonder if the music was written for the movie or the movie was written for the music. Most of the turmoil and issues of the sixties are fairly captured, and for me the movie brought back not only memories but almost-forgotten feelings about the events.  It is well worth the time to check out some of the special features.  And did I mention--watch it more than once!
B00275EHJG|5.0|Having grown up with toy story, and now being exactly the same age as Andy, I thought I should see the third movie, but I had know idea what to expect.  This film completely blew me away!  It was funny, intense, and moving, which every minute detail incredibly well thought out!  Pixar does a fantastic job of pulling you into the world of the Woody and the gang with all thier joys and struggles.  Then, just at the moment when things look bleakest, they throw in a little gag, a short funny moment that reminds you \\"Oh yeah, these are toys!\\"  All in all, a fantastic film for all ages!
B002RDCEX4|4.0|I usually come across one good album every year.  'Conditions' is just that.  I really like the single 'Sweet Disposition'.  I was glad I purchesd the entire MP3 album because it plays well, straight through, as an entire album.  \\"Conditions' sounds like it is a 3rd or 4th effort from a seasoned band, however this is Temper Trap's first release (I believe). Enjoy!
B000JLTR8G|5.0|One long but very good movie,beautiful sequences and music, acting is superb, Robert Mitchum is awesome,movie is a visual treat. despite not caring for sydney pollack's liberal views(was going to make recount-hbo-yawns) I think he did a great job making this movie. 5 stars!
B003NJPOAQ|4.0|The fact that Jack has run out of good ideas for songwriting has been made apparent in 'To the Sea'.  Being a long time fan I have to be critical. On the brighter side this release is more positive than Jack's last effort and the gloom and doom that encompassed of Sleep Through the Static.  However, 'Sleep' was a stronger effort as with all previous albums.  This one lacks the catchy tunes and creative lyrics that are expected.  There are a few good songs here but had they been released with any of his earlier albums they would have just been filler songs to the hits.  If I would compare 'To the Sea' to another of JJ's albums I would compare it with the Curious George Soundtrack.  Except CG had 3 really good songs on there. I'll compare it with this beacause of the continual tapping of piano keys and cheesy lyrics on some of the songs.  'To the Sea' should have been made for Curious George part II.  No hard feelings, JJ is still my favorite Singer/Songwriter, I am just not going to be excited about his new stuff anymore, what do you do? Even Jack is human.<br /><br />**update**  This album has really grown on me, it get's better with time, yes the creative lyrics are there , they just aren't as apparrent at first.  Upgraded to 4 stars.  Good effort Jack!
B0002V7O3S|3.0|Fire in the Sky is a creepy movie Loosely based on the book (which I read). the movie is meant to entertain as it's not as in the book or according to Walton,the most scariest scene is the flashbacks and it takes a while to get there. whether or not you believe the story it's up to you,but the movie is one of the most if not the most scariest alien abduction/alien movie.
6305781427|3.0|Music and musicians are great. If you can get passed Yanni swooning and snapping his head back you'll enjoy it. Watching Yanni, though, it truly annoying.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|There isn't much to analyze here.  It's a Point A to B to C to D to Ending kind of action movie with very little fleshing out of the tunnel which the movie goes through in terms of background, supporting characters, or detail.<br /><br />While there is gore, it's a tad too outlandish to scare most movie fans but the action itself is fairly decent with some nice sequences, if a bit predictable.  This isn't a movie you'll see twice but it's still a fun little ride the first time around if you just want a simple nice action movie.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|The first time I watched this movie, I was scared out of my mind. It was sickening, I almost couldn't handle it.     However, I rewatched it a few minutes ago and it's not half as scary as it was the first time. It actually became rather humorous since in the end there's a lot of irony to be had. So not so scary or horrific the second time watching it.    I'm very sure what's shown in this movie has happened and is still happening in some parts of the world, maybe even in some parts of the US for all we know. People go missing all the time, in many countries it's not even a big deal. \\"Oh you lost your daughter? Just have another one...\\"     The human species is more naturally prone to violence and negativity, we have to actually work hard to not be.    Re-watching this movie, I noticed a ton of flaws I didn't notice much the first time due to being so scared. Do guys typically act this watch around each other? I hope not, I'm a guy and I find the typical a bit insulting.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|I generally don't like Scorsese films but I liked this one.  Sustained suspense throughout.  Suggest watching with the lights off and candles lit throughout the house!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Eminem is a lyrical genius. This could be one of his best albums, and definitely album of the year.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Of the watches which I own, including an Eco-drive, a quartz Seiko, and a digital, this watch is my favorite. After 1.5 to 2 years of use, there has been no scratching on the crystal. If worn forever, it would practically run forever. Band does dirty and gather odor, but is cleanable with toothbrush and soap, as previous reviewer mentioned. Contrary to other reviewers, I really like the band. The material does not wear out and is comfortable. This watch's intricate mechanism and sweeping second hand (being and automatic) are the most amusing of watches in this price range. Although terribly inaccurate (off about 20 to 30 seconds a day) and necessitating a winder if not worn daily, this watch has served me very well. The design is spectacular and every detail is perfected.
1594202559|5.0|If you have read books like \\"stock Market wizard\\" and still feel that you don't have good idea how those people made so much money, this book is for you. Initially, I thought this book was just another hedge fund book without much substance. However, the author beautifully explains the trading methodologies of these star traders(and also their misses)- I was blown away. The author's insight into trading, leverage/economic history is remarkable, and by the reference list it is clear that he has put enormous efforts into this book. Compare this book with other hedge funds books and you will soon see the difference. I think this book may soon become a classic.
B00005AG7K|1.0|Chiming in with the other one star reviews, which I really wish I had read before making this purchase. The quality is absolutely terrible. Less than ten minutes into the film, we went through the trouble of re-hooking up the VCR, because we were convinced that our old VHS tape -- the one I had wanted to upgrade from -- was better quality. We were right. By comparison, the muddy VHS tape was absolutely gorgeous. Save your money. This is clearly an unofficial bootleg, and shouldn't be sold at all as though it's legitimate.
B000063Y8F|5.0|The Rosle Garlic Press has a mechanical advantage over the non-articulated press that it replaced.  The difference is in the amount of hand force required to do the press.  The instrument is relatively easy to clean.  I have used the Rosle about two dozen times and it feels well built, and should last.

B00000IOSU|4.0|Yes I know it's a live audience and they are very excited at the fact they are listening to a superb artiste, but what is it with the Yanks?

Apart from that....Sarah is SU-PERB!!!!
B001R4KQDE|5.0|This movie pops in Blu-ray format. Black stay true and colors jump off the screen
B002VECLVO|5.0|Having heard and read so many glowing reviews concerning the film \\"A Single Man\\", I purchased this DVD fearing that I might be a little disappointed--I was NOT!  If anything, I was far more moved by the film than I thought I would be shedding copious tears throughout practically the entire movie.  My reaction, I know, was because it is so wonderfully acted by especially Colin Firth and fabulously directed by Tom Ford!    Colin Firth has been a long time favorite actor of mine.  I became a serious fan of his after seeing him in \\"Another Country\\" many years ago.  However, I do feel this film shows him at his very best.  I was simply overwhelmed. His portrayal of a man that has just lost the love of his life and intends to do away with himself is fantastic.  This movie shows Colin as George on this \\"last day\\" of his life and how he deals with that one last day of his life.  What fine nuances Colin brings to his acting.  It's a performance that will \\"stick\\" to me for a long, long time.  After viewing this movie, I've had dreams about it and think about it a lot during the day especially about Colin as George and his acting.  There are moments in the movie that just a look from Colin Firth reduced me to tears--he is that good.      I'm not overlooking the other actors in the movie.  All of the actors in this are great.  I especially adored Julianne Moore as George's long time frustrated \\"girlfriend\\".  Colin and her little dance sequence is marvelous.       Tom Ford in his directional debut of a film makes this movie really \\"work\\" for me!  He certainly has a fine eye for detail.  Having lived through the era, I feel that he \\"got\\" the early 1960s just right even showing pink cigarettes in one scene.  But most of all,  he got great performances out everyone in the movie--I loved it.     The DVD is great with a clear picture and wonderful sound.  By the way, the sound track is great.    If you want to view a very moving film, buy this DVD.
B00003CX9W|3.0|The beauty of Fantasia is as immortalized as we can at present have it. However, this version is an unfortunate possessor of the ultra-close-up moment during the Pastoral scene. This distorts the image and makes it very grainy, hindering the viewing experience in such a startling manner that it actually cast a shadow over what has traditionally been one of my favorite portions. It is important to note that the tampering was done to cover/remove racially offensive material, but their solution left me wanting. I'm a much bigger fan of the &#34;roving foliage&#34; technique, as, while obvious and hilarious when you notice it, it does not burden the skill and beauty of the animation. Oddly enough, they used both techniques in this version, and I'm not certain why. Sticking to one would have been far more appropriate.  Edit for word choice.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Have your fingers ever slipped off of the bottom L2 or R2 button triggers during a gaming session, especially in crazy gaming situations? Well if you have like I did many times before I bought this product then I understand your frustration and I am happy to say that these dual trigger accessories are the answer to that annoying problem. Now I know what you are probably thinking, $5 for 2 pieces of plastic? I know because I thought the same thing when I first heard of this product, although I decided to give them a try since I was aggravated enough in dealing with the accidental design flaw in which sony was trying to make their new controller look sleeker but only made me aggravated every time when my fingers slipped off of the bottom L2 and R2 trigger buttons on the dual shock 3 controller. And at first when I bought them I said to myself these are not going to stay on, but surprisingly they do fit and stay snuggly on both of the L2 and R2 trigger buttons on the dual shock 3 controller. These trigger accessories are great, and makes things easier when playing games, especially driving games. And if you ever want to take them off it is not that hard to take them off or put them on and keep them on as they are designed that way. If you have a ps3 and play games on it then I recommend getting this product. I bought this product at a retail store for $4.99 + tax, but you can also buy this product online. In my opinion these trigger accessories for the dual shock 3 controller are essential and I wondered why I waited so long to get these.
0345472322|5.0|If there ever was an instruction  book on how to do life better, this would be it. And, doing life better requires  a change of mindset from a fixed to a growth-oriented one. When we live life with a fixed mindset, abilities and talents seem set in stone, and success and failures define who we are--or are not. On the other hand, when we adopt a growth mindset, we are constantly revising ourselves and successes and failures simply guide the way. As Carol herself summarizes:<br />\\"When people--couples, coaches and athletes, managers and workers, parents and children, teachers and students--change to a growth mindset, they change from a judge-and-be-judged framework to a learn-and-help-learn framework.\\" (p. 238)<br />An effective mix of research, case studies, and self disclosures, _Mindset_  is as informative as it is encouraging.  Think of it as an innovative toolbox for rebuilding, revising, and reengaging in strategies for living fully. It is one of those books that changes the way you view--and do--life.
B0000033RY|5.0|I had heard of Cactus back in the 70s.  I had them doing a couple of songs on a live compilation record set, with other artists on it.  When I heard Parchman Farm, I was totally into them.  I listened to the samples on Amazon and decided to get the disc.  I wish they had the song \\"No need to worry\\" on the disc.  This is an excellent slow blues Cactus did.  I really enjoyed reading the cd liner notes on the band as well.

B000H5TVJY|5.0|Christian Bale should have at least been nominated for a Oscar or whatever for his work in this because he nailed this role right on the head just like majority of his other roles. This movie is crazy from beginning to end & I actually found myself laughing out loud a few times at how the smallest things got to him. If you haven't seen this movie yet you are missing out this is a buy for sure especially on Blu-Ray.
0547258305|2.0|I give this book one star for the creative concept of the \\"graces\\". I give it one star for keeping my interest, mainly to find out the mystery of the kidnapping. Other than to preview for my daughter, I picked this book up for the fantasy side, not the romance, but if you're looking for romance, there's basically an ogling of the prince with his shirt off, and two physical scenes smack in the middle of the book (two scenes I wouldn't want my youth reading). It was disappointing to find a premarital affair romanticized in this supposed youth book. With only the few (although descriptive) romance scenes, they could've easily been left out and not detracted from the story at all. During most of the book, the couple isn't even together. On another note, there is a lot of fighting - breaking of fingers and smashing of heads by order of a bully king. There is also abuse of animals and young girls (spoken of with little description). The details of the story seemed to cross the line too many times into adult fiction, but the characters and story line are definitely teen fiction. It's almost like the author wanted to write for adults, but couldn't manage it. Overall it was just disappointing, because the \\"grace\\" concept was an intriguing foundation - wish it could've been pulled off better.
B00127RAJY|4.0|These workouts are fast-paced and challenging, particularly for individuals who, like me, want nothing to do with the gym.  After day one, I was so sore that I could barely hug people at my graduation :)  Best feeling ever.  I was a little discouraged when I did not begin losing weight immediately, but it's been about 25 days now, and I've lost about 5 lbs (which for me is a huge success).  And almost all of that has been in the last 5-7 days, so I'm hopeful for this last week of the 30 days.  In almost 30 days, I have just moved up to Workout 2 and am definitely finding it challenging.  There were parts of workout 1 that never became easy, but I moved up due to boredom from doing the same routine nearly every day for 3 weeks.    With regard to the DVD itself, there is a long unskippable intro, followed by a preview (which is skippable), followed by a ~3 minute long explanation of the workout by Jillian Michaels (unskippable).  This basically means that if you only have 25-30 minutes in the morning, this DVD is not for you.  The workouts are each about 20 minutes, but also have a warm-up (2-3 mins) and a cooldown (2-3 mins), not to mention about 5-7 minutes of unskippable content before you can get to the menu.  My solution was to put the DVD in while I started fixing breakfast, and this usually worked just fine.  However, on some mornings, I would go to turn on the TV (with the DVD having been \\"playing\\" [or so I thought] for ~7 minutes) only to have it begin at the very beginning, as if I had just then put it in the player.  The point is basically, buyer beware:  these workouts are great, and you will get results; however, doing the workouts quickly in a very limited amount of time may be frustrating, as you have to listen to Jillian Michaels explain the idea behind her method every single morning.    Oh, one more little perk is the DVD option to only play music during the workout, rather than listen to Jillian talk about each exercise.  I have not actually used this function, as I enjoy her encouragement and reminders on correct form, etc., so I am not sure if there is audio of which exercise to do next or if you have to watch very closely to see when to move on.  Hopefully I will remember to update this once the 30 days is officially over.
0439023491|2.0|(This review contains a few spoilers - so beware)<br /><br />After \\"The Hunger Games\\", I expected the book to pick up exactly where it left off. I wanted to see Katniss come home, I wanted to see her mother and sister's reactions. What had it been like for them, watching all those horrible things happen to her? And Gale? No. We get a summary flashback...and that sets the tone for the entire book. Collins can't rehash her first book, word for word - because that would be bad, right? So we get a summary of the preparations for the Quarter Quell, summaries of this, flashbacks of that, it's terrible.<br /><br />My hopes lifted when Katniss found those two refugees in the woods that were searching for District 13. Yes! I thought, Katniss is going to go with them! They're going on an adventure to find District 13. What happened to those people? What have they evolved into? How did they survive? Her and Peeta and Gale will organize an uprising, will find a way to communicate with all the other districts....alas, this is the awesome book I envisioned. I thought \\"She wouldn't have the characters go back into the arena, that's just too predictable.\\" That's exactly what happened.<br /><br />It could have been so much better. If she had not done the games and focused instead on secret meetings, on trying to get district 12 organized to join a rebellion, on finding district 13, it would have been a great book. It's like she was overwhelmed with the idea of doing all that, so she had it happen in a way that we don't see it and she doesn't have to write it. The arena just seems gimmicky, there's a lot of pointless violence because we don't really care about any of them, not the way we cared about Rue in the first book.<br /><br />Also, Katniss is incredibly unlikable. She's selfish and whiny (which others have described better than me) and just makes you want her to shut up already. She loves Gale...or does she? She doesn't love Peeta...or does she? We never see Gale, poor guy is nothing but a minor B plot character and yet we're supposed to believe this is a tortured love triangle.<br /><br />Enough said. If the third book is more of the same, I'll definately feel like I wasted 20 bucks.nothing but a minor B plot character and yet we're supposed to believe this is a tortured love triangle.<br /><br />Enough said. If the third book is more of the same, I'll definately feel like I wasted 20 bucks.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Of course let me say I am a big RUSH fan, but when I watched it with my wife who can take them or leave them, she loved it as well. If you have followed RUSH for a while, there is not much in the movie that will be new to you history wise. There is a TON of early info and video, pics, etc.etc. Nice to see the light shined on Rutsey's short involvement. The film makers almost spend too much time on the early years and skip a little too much after the Grace Under Pressure period. (In my worthless opinion anyways) Neil's tragic time is addressed with class and not dwelled on too much. It's a great story about 3 friends who just happen to be great musicians. The last chapter \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" is my favorite chapter, showing that nice guys can finish first.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I had previously heard some of Beyonce's songs and seen a few of her videos, and I found them to be decent, though nothing really special.  But yesterday, I watched this concert DVD, and I have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed!<br /><br />This gal has it all.  For starters, of course she's gorgeous and oozes a distinctly innocent sexiness.  Beyond this important superficiality, I was delighted to discover that she has abundant ability as an artist.  Most strikingly, I was blown away by how good a singer she is - easily in the top echelon of pop and R&B singers.  Next add that she's a great dancer (and somehow all that dancing never seemed to cause her to sweat or get out of breath!).  Finally, as a performer, she portrays her characters like a true actor, and her interaction with the audience is sincere and engaging.<br /><br />As an overall package, this (long) concert coheres well, with a nice variety of great songs, ranging from heartful ballads to bumpin grooves, all sequenced to form a natural flow.  Complementing that, we get an understated but effective use of costume changes and lighting.  Last but not least, her dancers are solid and her all-female band is super tight (I especially enjoyed the two drummers).<br /><br />Again, this is a great concert, and Beyonce demonstrates that she's a great artist and performer who deserves her success.  Add me to her fan club!<br /><br />7/25/10 Update: I recently purchased the Blu-Ray version of this DVD, and it's well worth it.  The improvement in visual clarity is huge.<br /><br />8/23/10 Update: I've now watched this DVD at least half a dozen times, and it has ascended to becoming my favorite concert DVD in any genre.  There's magic in this one!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|The Metal Militia is back in business. Metallica`s ninth studio album \\"Death Magnetic\\" is the proof that they have found their way back to speedy thrash metal. Who would have thought this, after their hard rock and country attempts \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\", as well as the raw and one-dimensional forerunner \\"St. Anger\\" in 2003? Nevertheless, \\"Death Magnetic\\" should be the desired turn to their thrash metal roots.   The album was released on September 12, 2008 through Warner Bros. Records and debuted as number one on the Billboard 200 in the United States. Outside of the U.S.A. they are distributed by Universal Music Group. No less a figure than the famous producer Rick Rubin accepted to work with the band. He displaced long-term producer Bob Rock, who acted as their producer since the excessively praised \\"Black Album\\" and even supported Metallica as bassist during the recording process of \\"St. Anger\\". After they had finished recording \\"St. Anger\\" in 2003, Rob Trujillo was announced to be the band's new bassist. Therefore \\"Death Magnetic\\" is the first Metallica record that features his bass tracks.   The rest of the band is still the classic line-up from 1983, consisting of the charismatic frontman and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield, drummer Lars Ulrich and lead-guitar-gunslinger Kirk Hammett. For the recording the band decided to work in different studios as well as their own studio HQ.  However, \\"Death Magnetic\\" features 10 tracks, including an instrumental. The album's starter \\"That was just your Life\\" begins with the beating of a heart and atmospheric, clean guitars that lead into the first gallops and palm muted riffs that James Hetfield is famous for. The sound is raw, mighty and with a certain edge to it. Hetfield's vocals sound like that of an angry sailor and are often interrupted by extended instrumental parts with dual-guitar lines. Fortunately, Ulrich's drums sound like drums again and not like bush telegraphy, as on \\"St. Anger\\". It is almost shocking to hear lead guitars and solos again, as Hammett was not allowed to do this on the forerunner. Concerning the lyrics, Hetfield surely does not sing about the happy days in life. The centre theme of the album is death and this is featured in all songs.   The intro of \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\" reminds a bit of the song \\"The Shortest Straw\\" from 1988, because of the staccato rhythmic. The track also contains a fiery guitar solo that starts with fast legato runs and ends in roaring double-stop bends. At this point, one has to say that the drumming of Lars Ulrich changed over the years. It seems that there is not as much use of the beloved double-bass as on the classic records. Hetfield's \\"What don't kill ya make ya more strong\\" lyrics make the whole thing kind of optimistic and motivating too.  Next in line is the song \\"The day that never comes\\". This one is the first single on the record that was released separately. The video to this song aroused some attention, as it deals with the war in Iraq. Some fans recognized similarities to Metallica's \\"Fade to black\\", as \\"The day that never comes\\" starts with clean and atmospheric arpeggios with a melody line on top. The verses are soft and melodic whereas the chorus is loud and powerful. Therefore, this song takes the same line as \\"Welcome Home\\" or the mentioned \\"Fade to black\\" in terms of these dynamics.   \\"Crawl from the wreckage one more time...\\" is the first line of the album's next song \\"All Nightmare Long\\". What a fitting line for the beginning of Metallica's new era, isn't it? The song contains a lot of fast tremolo picking and gallops. In terms of the vocals, it seems that this song put a lot of stress onto Hetfield's voice, as there are a lot of high-pitched notes to reach. All in all, it is fast and heavy and comes close to old-school thrash metal. Another specialty is the song \\"The Unforgiven III\\". This song falls in line with \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"The Unforgiven II\\" - both on previous records. The song dynamics are changed around, so that there are heavy verses combined with a calm chorus. \\"The Unforgiven III\\" features piano arpeggios along with the typical clean, almost sterile sounding, guitars. As the song moves on, subtle strings come in and support the slow-moving vocals. \\"Suicide and Redemption\\" is the only instrumental on \\"Death Magnetic\\". With almost 10 minutes of length, Metallica have met their standard from the old days in terms of quantity. On the quality side, this instrumental can not keep up with the ones on previous records. It sounds like a typical Metallica song, but there is the impression that the vocals are missing. There is no chance that \\"Suicide and Redemption\\" reaches the power and the groove of instrumentals like \\"Orion\\" or \\"Ktulu\\". Death Magnetic's grand finale is the song \\"My Apocalypse\\". With a length of about 5 minutes it is the shortest track on the album.  In conclusion, Metallica achieved to awake their passion and love for speedy and heavy music. For the first time since the late 80s, the songs feature the typical complex structure and the raw charm of thrash metal from the Bay Area. Metallica went back from short, radio suitable tracks to the old-school metal sound. The band's intention was to create songs that follow the line of their classics. In different words, they tried to copy themselves. As a consequence, the tracks on \\"Death Magnetic\\" do not feature a lot of variety and start to get old fairly quick. As mentioned, the sound is raw and not in any case over-produced. Here and there it seems that some parts are distorted and need a bit of re-mastering. One could see the reason for that in Rick Rubin's unconventional style of producing, as he was not present at the studio very often.  Nevertheless, Metallica have made a step into the right direction and they have clarified that there is still life in the old dogs yet.
B001C4AFOY|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />\\"The Young Victoria\\" takes us back to the 1830s, when England's future queen was a mere princess of seventeen - yet all set to take her rightful place on the throne, soon to be vacated by her ailing and childless uncle, King William.  However, such an ascension was easier said than done, for there were those who believed that the sheltered young woman was just a bit too naïve in the ways of the world to successfully carry out the duties of a leader of the British Empire.  The movie also focuses on the romance between the princess and her German cousin, Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), who sees in Victoria a woman of independent thought and strong will - a quick-witted individual who has the ability to see through much of the palace politics and behind-the-scenes machinations going on around her.  Yet, the fly-in-the-ointment comes in the form of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), Prime Minister of England and a first-class manipulator, who charms his way into becoming the young queen's personal confidante and helper, largely in control of the people she sees and the decisions she makes - a relationship that ultimately threatens to bring on a constitutional crisis for the nation and that finally comes to a head once the queen has chosen Prince Albert to be her husband.<br /><br />Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, \\"The Young Victoria\\" is a visually opulent costume drama that, nevertheless, manages to keep its characters relatable and life-sized.  This is due, in large part, to Emily Blunt, who makes of the queen a modern, forward-looking young woman who takes her royal duties and her commitment to her subjects, especially the downtrodden ones, with the utmost seriousness.  The always reliable Jim Broadbent also scores as the aging and irascible king who precedes her on the throne.  Still, the screenplay by Julian Fellowes could probably have done with a little less fawning over the royal couple, as I'm sure their romance was not quite as idyllic or their lives and personalities quite as unyieldingly noble as they are depicted herein.<br /><br />Stylistically, the movie may be elegant and stately, but it's rarely stilted or stuffy. The royal stratagems and political power plays can sometimes be hard to follow for us plebeians in the audience, but armchair historians will find much to whet their Victorian Era appetites here.ties quite as unyieldingly noble as they are depicted herein.

4770030088|5.0|I can't give this book - the whole series in fact - enough stars. It is truly outstanding, and was a lifesaver when I lived in Japan.    First, some context: I've studied Japanese and Chinese at Harvard, Yale & Princeton, so I've seen quite a few methodologies for teaching East Asian languages. My verdict is that \\"Japanese for Busy People\\" is by far the BEST AND MOST ENJOYABLE.     It's the best methodology, because it tries really hard to introduce grammar and vocab at a manageable pace, and in a practical context. I found it ideal for self-study - very clear explanations, in just the right amount of detail. Whenever I would study a lesson, I would end up using what I'd learnt within a few days, sometimes a few hours!  Most other methodologies (for example Nakama 1 & 2) are very overwhelming - they rely on rote memorization and try to force feed every grammatical detail, so much that nothing \\"sticks\\".    It's also the most enjoyeable methodology, which is VERY IMPORTANT because you want a book that you're going to WANT to pick up during your free time. The enjoyment comes from the excellent presentation, clear explanations, relevant subject-matter, as well as the CD. I found myself listening to the lessons on my iPod when I was walking on the street, and opening the book whenever I had 5 minutes in the subway. I was amazed at how quickly I was learning.     All in all, I've never found an easier methodology that gave me so quickly a smattering of \\"fluency\\" with only a beginner's range of vocab and grammar. The only caveat is that you really need to get to book 2 to dive into the grammar.    P.S. I recommend the Romanized version over the Kana version. Wait till book 2 to tackle the Japanese alphabet.

Having enjoyed the book immensely, I purchased copies of the book to share with other people when they were grieving the death of a loved one. I think most will find the book to be a pleasant and faith-inspiring read.<br /><br />I admire the courage Ms. Eadie had in writing about such personal and meaningful things.<br /><br />For those looking for some scientific validation of the afterlife, this isn't the book for you. For those who don't believe in an afterlife, this may not be the book for you. This is one person describing her experience from her perspective in her words.

0061733199|5.0|As an Eagle Scout, I decided to purchase this book as a condensed means to information when I go out camping. Though I have done more then my fair share of camping and backpacking, its extremely difficult to keep this information memorized unless you are backpacking very regularly and using this information. Its got excellent information and detailed diagrams of everything from building a shelter to typical plants that are edible or not. If you are an avid outdoor backpacker, I highly recommend this book.

B00009RAJH|5.0|I bought my first Fleetwood Mac LP in 1968. Between that year and 1994 I purchased four more. I considered myself a fan, not one of those who buy every record the band released, but someone who acquired casually and enjoyed what he heard. In July 1975 someone played me this LP, his latest purchase. I was very pleasantly surprised. Although I had travelled with the group from the early blues days through to the Bob Welch days the 1975 Fleetwood Mac record was a revelation. The addition of Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham to the line-up had an immediate and startling affect. The band had been moving towards a less bluesy and more pop oriented sound for a couple of years. However with this album they jumped in with both feet. I was instantly hooked by their easy listening West Coast sound. Who could have imagined back in 1968 that the Christine McVie of Chicken Shack (I'd Rather Go Blind) would be penning such smooth and jazzy songs as Over My Head and Say You Love Me. Stevie Nicks made a terrific contribution with her trio of compositions, Rhiannon, Crystal and Landslide while fellow newcomer Lindsay Buckingham offered Monday Morning and I'm So Afraid. I know that I'm in a minority (5 times platinum to 19 times!) but I prefer Fleetwood Mac to Rumours. The high points are just as high and while there isn't a weak song to be found on the former I can think of several songs on the latter that leave me lukewarm.
B000VWONRI|5.0|I used to own the actual CD of this album, and it is brilliant.  Eminem has really creative grooves, and his lyrics and delivery are outstanding.<br /><br />But the download is the clean version.  Not that I crave curse words, but when you are listening to Eminem, \\"bad words\\" are kinda frequent and he uses them to great effect.  The constant \\"scratches\\" to cover the words is just distracting, and interrupts the groove.<br /><br />On a more philosophical note, shouldn't the product you order be the uncut product be default?  The clean, censored, or otherwise altered product should be labeled as such.  You shouldn't have to hunt for the \\"Explicit Lyrics\\" version.  I love Amazon, but that annoys me.

B002FOQXZK|5.0|I love this album, and at first I wasnt even a fan of kid cudi's, but this album is so different and so real it's crazy. The songs flow together and even though he may not be an A+ singer, his vocals fit the songs. That rarely happens, but some of the songs sound good with him singing a little off key, I love the beats, love the way they loop together, his cd out did Jay-z's bp3.

B00009R86L|4.0|I'm actually pretty happy with the padding on my existing camera bags (mostly Lowepro and Tamrac).  I do use it with one fairly large bag that I load up to carry on trips, and it does help a SLIGHT bit, but everything is relative.  A heavy bag is still a heavy bag.    However, I thought I'd try using this pad with a guitar strap.  This works great for that purpose.  Even heavier guitars like Les Pauls seem lighter with this pad, even during longer playing sessions.  I'll probably buy a couple more for this purpose.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|OK, I haven't seen the original since it came out in theaters, way back when. That said, this stays reasonably true to its origin (as I recall it), but still offers enough newness to make remaking worthwhile.<br /><br />Jaden Smith makes an exceptionally handsome young lead. Jackie Chan takes the role of Mr. Miyagi (sorry - Mr. Han) in a more serious manner than his past films might lead you to believe, and does a more than fair job of it. (He does get one lovely bit of comedic choreography, though.) Jaden's girlfriends is, of course, tweenage cuteness incarnate. China is China - majestic at times, crowded, isolated, commercial, spiritual, and all its other selves, a highly adaptable backdrop to any mood the movie might need. It's no spoiler to say that the bullied new kid wins out gloriously in the end.<br /><br />My one complaint is the way he wins out. Where the heck did that move come from? No matter, it was a good one. A complaint that I expect to hear but don't share is, why was his mother just sitting there while her son was getting  whomped into floorboards? If you have to ask, you probably won't understand the answer. Mothers of sons know that their sons are going to do things that get them hurt - better they get hurt under adult supervision, with a medic close at hand. And, since he's going to do wild and life-threatening things anyway, a mentor you more-or-less approve of lets you keep an eye on the craziness. In the alternative, he does crazy stuff anyway but does it with worse people and hides it from you. I don't call that bad mothering - quite the opposite. It's hard to keep rapport with tween- and teen-aged kids; you take what rapport there is where you find it.<br /><br />A bit more brutal than the original, it's a product of a different decade. It's just as much of a feel-good flick or date movie as the original, though. I enjoyed The Karate Kid, again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0142410705|5.0|John Green is enthusiastic about what he does. He loves to talk about it, and even more, he loves to do it. He loves to write, and that exuberance shines off of each page.<br /><br />Reading 'An Abundance of Katherines' is like reading about the kids I wished I knew in high school. Colin and Hassan and Lindsey made me laugh more times than I can count. Of course, the reality is that John Green made me laugh - but while I was reading it, that's not how it felt. It felt like I was part of the joke, taking part in the conversation. That feeling alone makes it something pretty special.<br /><br />'An Abundance of Katherines' is a story about a road trip. Sort of. Colin and Hassan really don't spend much time on the road, but they do get away from Colin's tragic history of being dumped by 19 girls named Katherine, and give him time to uncover his mathematical theorem to predict the rise and fall of all romantic relationships. They keep getting distracted, though - by feral pigs and Hardees, by pink mansions and tampon strings, by girls named Katrina (not a Katherine) and Lindsey (DEFinitely not a Katherine). And through these distractions, they find their way.<br /><br />The book is quite a ride, from beginning to end. I could say quite a lot about it that would probably make it sound way less fun that it actually is. For example: it's poignant and clever, sharp and observant. It packs quite an emotional punch and leaves you thinking about relationships and friendships and intelligence and human potential. These are all true, but the glue that brings it all together is John Green's enthusiasm for his craft. He takes what might be boring and makes it engaging and fun to read. And it makes for a nearly-perfect novel.<br /><br />When so many writers seem to \\"suffer\\" for their work, it's kind of refreshing to read someone who so clearly loves what he does. And when he can transmit that love straight to us, the reader...well, that's writing at its best.<br /><br />That's pretty much magic.
B000002JKA|5.0|A great bridge album between the early WDADU and overly polished Images and Words (although BOTH are great albums!) and the heavier/more recent output. AWAKE is something special (particularly in relation to their later works). The whole album is solid, intelligent, musically advanced, and atmospherically dense and dark. I will say I miss Kevin Moore; as one can tell his influence on the 'old' DT sound could be quite profound at times. Nevertheless, I love DT, but AWAKE is especially chilling as a musical, lyrical, and atmospheric behemoth.
0765356139|4.0|\\"The Well of Ascension\\", book 2 of the Mistborn trilogy by Brandon Sanderson.<br /><br />Many expected their lives to change for the better once the Lord Ruler was gone however the reality of the situation is much bleaker. Elend Venture has taken the role of king with Vin at his side however this may be a short lived position. Elend's father has moved an army into an aggressive position right outside the gates of Luthadel and seems intent on taking Elend's position and the Atium everyone believes he has. To make matters worse the ashmounts have begun to spew even more ash making it unlikely that crops will grow. The problems continue to mount as Elend and Vin look for solutions to unsolvable problems...<br /><br />\\"The Well of Ascension\\" was a strong follow to \\"[[ASIN:0765350386 Mistborn : Final Empire Series (Book #1) (Mistborn, Book 1)]]\\" though not quite its predecessor's equal. Sanderson continues to develop his already well drawn characters though there are points where the action sequences are traded for political and character development which weren't a problem and did serve to further the story.<br /><br />The Good: Strong characters, solid action sequences and good dialogue which all appear to be signature's of Sanderson are all prevalent within the book. Political world building, and a well thought out plot are also a solid devices in the Well of Ascension.<br /><br />The Bad: There are times when the actions of Vin seem very out of character but all of these things manage to be brought into perspective within the book and the follow up \\"[[ASIN:0765356147 The Hero of Ages: Book Three of Mistborn]]\\".<br /><br />Overall: If you like the first \\"The Well of Ascension\\" is a very worthy follow up. Give it a try.
0765356147|4.0|\\"The Hero of Ages\\", book three of The Mistborn trilogy by Brandon Sanderson.<br /><br />What appeared to be salvation within the Well of Ascension for the people of The Final Empire may have actually been their doom. Tables turn quickly as perspective changes for Vin and Elend Venture as they walk their mile in the Lord Ruler's shoes. Ruin, the evil being the Lord Ruler fought to contain now has free reign and he seeks to destroy everything and Vin and Elend must attempt to seek the clues left behind by the Lord Ruler in hopes of placing Ruin back in his prison and saving the Final Empire...<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson continues his solid streak with this strong conclusion to the Mistborn Trilogy. Well drawn characters, good action sequences and a solid plot carry the story.<br /><br />The Good: All the elements that worked the two previous outings are in play once again. Brandon Sanderson employees what have now become his signature traits to finish off this series and once again it is a success.<br /><br />The Bad: There is one thing that comes to mind that can be looked at in one of two ways regarding the finish to this series. Without giving any spoilers, at the conclusion of the story you could possibly find yourself asking if any of the things that took place were ever even necessary to begin with. If the answer is that all the events led to the turning point then all the good stays in place. If in your mind it boils down to chance and timing alone you could be left feeling a bit empty about the whole thing.<br /><br />Overall: The Hero of Ages was a strong finish to the series and if you enjoyed the other two pick this one up also. If you are looking two try Brandon Sanderson for the firs time don't start here. Start with \\"[[ASIN:0765350386 Mistborn : Final Empire Series (Book #1) (Mistborn, Book 1)]]\\".
0060920432|4.0|One of the main concerns that someone might have with this book is that the research is a bit outdated.  The behavioral literature has been booming in the past 15-20 years and there have been numerous new findings and studies that would have enhanced the strength and validity of this book.  Furthermore, even though the data that is used is legitimate and reliable, no \\"hard\\" data such as brain scans is used to provide chemical and neurological evidence to support the author's claims.  Once again, this is probably as a result of the age of the book.  Such studies were most likely not available when Flow was written.<br /><br />However, even with this limitation, Flow does an excellent job of guiding the reader through a journey about what really makes people happy.  This is NOT one of those 1000's of \\"Self-Help\\" books that are advertised everywhere.  The author takes a scientific approach to the question of \\"what really makes us happy?\\" and \\"how do people consistently stay happy?\\"  Survey and interview data are constantly referenced and it gives the reader insight on when people experience their greatest levels of happiness.  The author focuses attention on consistent patterns that emerge across numerous age groups and races.  For instance, individuals report the highest levels of self growth and discovery when they \\"lose themselves\\" into what they are currently involved in and reach new heights of intense concentration and immersion.  Paradoxically, by \\"losing the self,\\" they experience the most amount of self growth in the process.  The author finds such an experience present across both cultures and time.<br /><br />Flow is ideal for anyone that is interested in an objective and academic look on happiness. The conclusions and observations can certainly be applied in one's everyday life and I have gradually started to attempt to recreate some of the principles described both during work and my leisure time.  If a young person like me can make such connections, it should potentially be easier for someone older and with more life experiences.ould potentially be easier for someone older and with more life experiences.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Jungle Book, the movie, is radically different from the classic Rudyard Kipling novel but I tend to be more forgiving if a movie preserves the spirit of the book but in this case it absolutely doesn't. The characters are completely different and remain the same only in name and species. In particular the literary Baloo is nothing like the singing slacker from the movie. One might note that at the beginning it states that the movie was `inspired' by Kipling's Jungle Book and I assume by this it means that Disney was inspired to write a completely new story. The real question is whether or not the Jungle Book, standing on its own, is a quality animated movie. Of course it is, it's Disney but that doesn't mean it's spectacular. The Jungle Book is a rather small tale that takes place over the course of one or two days as Mowgli is taken by Bagheera and Baloo to live in the man village.<br /><br />There are a few issues with the movie that can be a bit cringe worthy. The monkeys who kidnap Mowgli, including King Louis, are all portrayed as stereotypical blacks. Now one might argue that the movie does take place in Africa except it doesn't. The Jungle Book takes place in India which is in Asia. Why aren't the monkeys portrayed as stereotypical Indians? There is a tremendous amount of Disneyfication. In the book Mowgli grows to loath the humans for their treatment of his parents and uses elephants to raze the village to the ground. This is, shall we say, NOT the ending Disney went with. In the book Mowgli kills Shere Khan and skins him rather than having him scamper off with his tail on fire.<br /><br />The animation is old fashioned yeoman type work but in this case that is a big compliment. There is no corner cutting here as each characters is drawn alive and active rather than static with moving mouths as cheaper animation studios will do. The character movement is very believable and I'm sure a ton of rotoscoping was done which I don't consider cheating in the least. Disney was well known for doing meticulous research on animal movement and Shere Kahn looks great as he stalks Mowgli. The music is very catchy including the python Kaa's `Trust in Me' and Baloo's wonderful `Bear Necessities'. Overall the animation is probably average or below average for a Disney movie (which are always above average for animation in general). It's very dark and often bland.<br /><br />So what you get is a dramatically watered down story that kinds of leaves it a bit dull. It's just a one (or perhaps two) day journey to the man village and not a whole heckuva lot happens. There are segments where Mowgli meets a group of elephants and another with some buzzards imitating the Beatles (a rather unfortunate attempt to tap into some pop culture circa 1967). Both of these segments added nothing to the larger story which is paper thin. I like the concept behind The Jungle Book and there are great elements but if I were to start a collection of Disney movies The Jungle Book would be low on my list of movies to own.isney was well known for doing meticulous research on animal movement and Shere Kahn looks great as he stalks Mowgli.

B003J27WFW|5.0|This is truly the definitive retrospective that Rush seems to have been chasing for the last ten years thru other releases in DVD or book form. This seems to have been built for someone who knows nothing about the band while covering elements that a hardcore fan may have never known. I thought I knew it all. I thought I'd seen every photo. I thought I'd viewed every clip. I've been a fan since 1984. These guys continue to pull stuff out of the mothballs that suspends my disbelief. Who knew there was film of Alex telling his family that he planned to drop out of high school?! It was so nice that they shared that classic moment. Alex keeps his feelings just below the surface and to be able to see one of the most key moments in his upbringing was truly a treasure. And Geddy may not write the lyrics but he speaks with great tact and clarity regarding Neil's personal history. On Neil- I'd love to chat him up but that possibility is addressed too. In simple terms, I can relate to the embarrassment he feels as I have a coworker who would hug me hourly if I allowed it. Neil has nothing to be embarrassed about but we don't give this much adulation to the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker. His dignity is fed by his work and not much else. When fans emasculate themselves when trying to tell him how much they admire him, he gets uncomfortable.     Values. That's probably the biggest eye opener for me personally as a fan since 1984. I share a lot of the same values as these guys and their satisfaction comes from two things: Working on the their craft and being philomaths on learning new crafts. Professional perfectionists who want to punch the time clock, go home and read a book or watch a thought provoking movie. Girls, vices and other distractions cut into this time and they won't have that! They do emphasize the value of play, family, friends but only after they've exhausted themselves with their craft. One other favorite moment is an early outdoor interview with Geddy that I'd seen before on a another DVD. Geddy appears to be bored if not snarky with the interviewer. They cut to current day Geddy and he seems to acknowledge their burnout in the early days of playing night after night with few breaks. I also feel that all the kudos from other celebrities validates Rush in a way that reveals that their following is not so underground anymore.
B002SQFZ68|4.0|Great video and audio and honestly I think they just keep getting better with age. They all seem to still have a spark and although their voices are a bit lower they appeared to compensate for the physical changes and definitely continue to rock.

0307454541|1.0|I'm sorry, I just have to give this one star.<br /><br />I am a huge reader of mysteries and thrillers and I will read ANYTHING. I finally got over my reluctance due to the hype of this book and gave it a chance.<br /><br />I consider myself a very intelligent person, and I'm afraid this just sucked. I have no desire to read the last two.<br /><br />1. The \\"action\\" is very slow and the book takes about 1/3 to get going. THere is a ton of really boring stuff in the beginning.<br /><br />2. The main characters are totally unappealing and unrealistic in my humble opinion.<br /><br />3. The resolution is predictable, cliched, and shallow, just like the main characters. The quotes in each section allude to some big social meaning to the story, but in the end it's just one sick individual. The writer doesn't make any social connections at all.<br /><br />4. I agree that this book is totally misogynistic.<br /><br />5. I just didn't care and do not understand in the least why it is so popular. I felt disgusting after reading it.
B0030E1XJU|2.0|I bought this for my daughter's 5th birthday.  Manufacturer says it is appropriate for 5 years and up.  I have to disagree on that one.  Since it is an action sequence toy, one false move sets off a chain reaction and all the setting up is blown before it can be enjoyed.  This is not a toy that most young children can be left alone with to play on their own.  At least in this house, if my daughter wants to play with it, then I'm playing with it too.    And it's really not so much fun to begin with.  She opened it, we played with it once, and it hasn't been touched since.

If things go right they just might be able to put enough money together to buy that piece of property and live off of the fat of the land. Raise chickens and rabbits and live out a simple yet pleasant life which isn't an uncommon theme for the time. Just a few more jobs and their dream might be realized...<br /><br />The story told in \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is simple and straight forward enough however the richness within is delivered in Steinbeck's ability to quickly draw strong characters and set the tone not only in each scene but for the times in which the characters live as well.<br /><br />The good: As stated this story is all about Steinbeck's ability to present strong characters and give the reader a good feel and understanding of the time and place in which the story takes place.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable.<br /><br />Overall: \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is worthy of the moniker `Classic' and deserves your attention.

0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller nails it.  While at first it seems a chaotic mess of dark situational humor and commentary of the state of war, main characters (dozens!), and time-jumping, a wonderful pattern is found in it all.  Read it through twice: first to find out why Orr was getting hit in the head by a shoe-wielding prostitute, then again to understand why there were crabapples in his cheeks.  What a masterpiece!<br /><br />For those who wish to read it only once: There are crabapples in his hands, not in his cheeks.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|I had my reservations about this disc.  That was before I heard it.  Now I say this as someone who is hardly a newbie to AIC. I have been with them ever since Dirt in '92.  This is the best album they have ever released, bar none.  For a band to skip 14 years and release a disc that picks up right where they left off is absolutely unbelievable. The disc just blows me away. Jerry's vocals over the years have not suffered in the least. Will DuVall is a fantastic addition to the band. He can sing his azz off, and he adds a second guitar to the mix. Now when Jerry is soloing the rhythm guitar doesn't go away onstage and that lends the band a much fatter linear sound overall. Layne would be proud.  If you have ever been an AIC fan you simply cannot go wrong with this.  Some say they had to have time for the songs to grow on them.  With me, this was not the case. My jaw dropped from the get go.  Those who claim this isn't AIC, it's a Jerry Cantrell disc are just barking dogs.  The only song that is even close to a departure for the band is Take Her Out, and that has more to do with subject matter than anything else. The familiar layered vocals combined with Jerry's singular style of riffage makes this song another classic AIC tune regardless of being about a chick.   This is the best comeback album I have ever heard, and it is VINTAGE ALICE IN CHAINS to boot.  Black Gives Way To Blue will be the second most popular disc from these guys right behind Dirt.  Hell(o), right now I PREFER it to Dirt, and Dirt has aways been my favorite, followed by Jar of Flies/Sap.  Give this a try, you will not be dissapointed. I have been listening to it daily for about 2-3 months now, and I can't stop listening to it.  ALICE IN CHAINS RETURNS WITH THEIR BEST ALBUM EVER.   Thanks guys for soldiering on (even if it is 14 years later).  ALICE RULES!
0142004235|5.0|This is one of my fave books and I will read it again soon.  Though the ending was not ideal for me, it was a great read.
030726999X|5.0|I have absolutely loved the Millenium trilogy and wish it wouldn't end.  The characters are fantastic, the plots twist and turn...  The second two books in the series you can't put down.  The first book not so much, but you have to read it in order to understand the next two.  Great reads for anyone who enjoys a good crime/thriller with excellent character development.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I'm not exactly a *rabid* Rush fan, but I loved their music ever since Moving Pictures.  This documentary was fun, insightful and full of music.  If you're even a casual fan of the band, you will love it.  If you just want to know the history of the band, then you will find this to be very interesting and entertaining.

0446569895|5.0|Reading Ozzy's autobiography is like hanging out at his house and listening to him talk. It's funny, crazy, and at times a little shocking - which is exactly what you'd expect Ozzy's life to be. He tells it like it is; no secrets and no flowery language. Whatever you might think of the man, you certainly can't say that his book is dull. And the photos included are great!
1594202249|5.0|More like \\"Crying Of Lot 49\\" than \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" in that this novel is linear and easily understood. Gordita Beach has got to be Redondo Beach. Captures so-Cal in the seventies. Man, the dope was great.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|If you like u2 and like having this type of DVD is a must have in your collection. One of the best concert ever. Play list is great, it had almost all the great songs. Visually amazing.     The concert had around 100K in the stadium and that energy is on the DVD.     3 words for you: BUY BUY BUY =)
073935275X|5.0|Well written. A good plot and a fantastic story. The trilogy is a must read or listen. I enjoyed the audio edition. I think I had more joy listening to the story than should I have read it. A pity the author died.
B001FB5634|5.0|I can really recommend this dvd. It is a really universal lovestory between parent and child. I first read the novel and loved the dialueges there. The movie is truely compareable to the novel. The two protagonist are the best they could have chosen.   Go and see it!
B0032FPVKE|5.0|AmazonBasics Camcorder Bag with Shoulder Strap (Black)<br /><br />AmazonBasics Camcorder Bag with Shoulder Strap (Black) has a roomy sectioned main compartment for a small camcorder and battery pack with 3-other zippered pockets for holding accessory items or other small gadgets.<br /><br />The inside is buttery soft to prevent scratches, which is a real plus. Can carry 3-ways - shoulder strap, belt or by hand. This is a nifty (light weight), well cushioned, compact bag with lots of room. Perfect as a carry-on for air travel, school function or family reunion. Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2010

1594488843|4.0|Dan Pink presents great insight into the gap between what science knows and what business does about motivation. Using a variety of metaphors to clearly state his arguments, Pink makes a compelling case for recognizing that management approaches based on compliance are not going to serve organizations well in the new world of work that is evolving with our changing business and economic environment.<br /><br />The central thesis is laid out neatly - humans need three things to motivate themselves: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. These are the drivers of intrinsic motivation, which Pink argues is critical for any non-algorithmic work (not just creative work, but anything that is non-repetitive or that involves problem solving).<br /><br />After the preliminary groundwork is presented, a chapter is dedicated to each element (autonomy, mastery, purpose). Scientific studies - often with counter-intuitive results - are peppered throughout the book and support Pink's arguments quite nicely. Of course, this works well because there are no counter-arguments presented to this case. Instead, there are a series of recaps and exercises designed to help reinforce Pink's thesis.<br /><br />The book is very well-written, compelling, and thought-provoking. I consider it a must-read for those who wish to contemplate the way the business world is evolving. Profound change is in the air.<br /><br />If you enjoy the book (or if you need more to explore before purchasing), be sure to watch his TED Talk on this topic, and Google the RSA animation video as well.
B0035J6TAI|2.0|I am a BIG Peter Gabriel fan. These songs are extreeeeeemly slowwwww, no percussion, and covers. Did the great P.G. sign with Muzak? Boring and tedious. It's sad to hear one of my favorite artists butcher works of other favorite artists. Yawn.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|So yeah, after the bad taste of the first two movies, this is actually the good one! But its still a bad movie. Do the actors improve? Yes, albeit slightly. Some of the supporting vampires actually get lines, two of which actually get backstories and characterization (something that these movies don't like to elaborate on). Though the woman who plays the vampire wife (I honestly don't remember her name, they never say it in this one) I pity because she literally has no lines in the entire movie until the end when they're defending the pointless new-born vampire. Even the werewolf flashback was better than the main story. The story should've been about the people with interesting histories, not some stupid idiot who wants to sell her soul just to become a blood-thirsty killer. Where's the logic. Oops, forgot, there is no logic here. Yet Bella is the worst female character ever written. She thinks her life is tortured yet she has two guys chasing after her! Then, being the jerk she is, plays on their emotions. Like after she kisses the werewolf and finds out Edward is standing right behind her. And the fact that she was stupid enough to not to wear a coat in the mountains (she really just wanted the Perpetually Shirtless Werewolf to get in the sack with her. I don't buy that \\"constant hot temperature\\" thing)! Though the funny part was she breaks her hand after punching him! I'd watch that scene in a loop if could and still find it funny! And of course let's not forget (though I can understand why you would seeing as how she has TWO SCENES in the whole movie) our Gratuitous Celebrity Cameo; Dakota Fanning! Why she gets so much acclaim I'll never know. Her character is pointless to the plot and I know what she makes people see when she tortures them (it's the first two movies). Action finally occurs though there's only two bits; first is a chase sequence that goes no where except to reintroduce the minor annoyance that is Victoria (who they could've done the story without) and finally the big fight between the good guys and the bad guys. And I must ask if there's any real reason why the vampires break like glass or if we're supposed to accept that it comes with their glitter skin? It's a decent fight but I don't get why the good vampires were so concerened about the new-borns, I'm pretty sure they could've beaten them without the werewolves. Howard Shore picks up the music department in this, which probably makes it feel more legitimate to me, but knowing that he's degrading himself after doing Lord of the Rings is disappointing (but a paycheck's a paycheck). All in all, it was a decent movie and I'm glad to see that they are improving but for a non-fan like myself who's just now saying that the third movie is the good one is pretty bad considering most movies with a part three are generally considered the worst and never live up to the first two. I only hope that the next two parts (ripping off Harry Potter?) will be just as mildly satisfying.ut) and finally the big fight between the good guys and the bad guys.

0785134352|2.0|When you see something to much, it loses it's effect. The blood, the violence, and the swearing doesn't shock, cause it's on EVERY page. People claim this book shows what would happen if superheroes REALLY existed. The blood shed is at Mortal Kombat levels. And if anyone went on Myspace and talked about doing this stuff, the FBI would track the IP and bust them... cause, vigilantism IS against the law.    The story is weak. A superhero comic about a kid who reads superhero comics, wants to become a superhero, and is a commentary on superhero comics... is... just, TO meta. I have yet to watch the film, but I could see this working if it was removed from the medium in which it is commenting on.    This could be a fun read, if it wasn't trying to be serious.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I could listen to Anthony read a 1st grade primer!!! This book is hilarious, if you are a fan of Mr. Bourdain's wicked and offbeat sense of humour.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|If you want to marvel at some wonderfully done CGI work, this is a treat, to watch briefly. The story itself is gravely overexaggerated, with poor acting. Countless \\"close calls at the last possible second\\" and just completely unbelievable in all regards. Strange thing is, they ace the CGI, yet one scene where the characters (if you call them that) are in the back of a truck, it looks like a small town studio shot it. No sun, shadows, or wind, just a clean ride with a stormy green-screened backdrop. Maybe worth a dollar to rent, but not worth the 2 hours to expect any sort of enjoyable story. I'm not sure why Danny Glover subjected himself to such a poor film. This is the last John Cusack movie I will bother watching.
B001C09KD0|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is brilliant and articulate; but at the same time, she's funny and irreverant.  She really explains what it's like to be inside the head of a woman in the search of the meaning of life!

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Battle Royale is simply one of the best movies that human has created. Fukasaku has taken this controversial novel and turned it into a masterpiece.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Wow...this movie hit me hard.  I don't like crying at movies, but this story is quiet and powerful.  It falls along the lines of On Golden Pond, Dead Poet's Society, Precious....a quiet little hit.  It's a bit different than the mentioned movies, but it leaves you with extremely deep thoughts after the final scene.  It's absolutely beautiful and in a year of terrible movies that lack in every way....this movie surprised me.  Hours after watching it, I am still thinking about the act of loyalty, love and devotion. Fine for the family with a powerful message. Do not hesitate to rent for a night of fine crying....I didn't want to watch this movie because of this but after seeing it, I am glad I did.  It punches you in the gut...turn off the phones, watch alone or watch it with friends and family.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I watched the Oprah Winfrey-narrated version when it was on TV, and then ordered this version, instead.  Nothing against Oprah; I just happen to enjoy my nature documentaries narrated by Sir David.  And he is head-and-shoulders above Oprah when it comes to this type of thing!!  The elegance of the blu-ray cinematography (which is truly stunning, by the way) seems to deserve the eloquence of Attenborough's crisp, British delivery.  They complement one another so well!!  And the bonus clips that show how the film's producers achieved some of the more stunning shots might be some of the most amazing portions of the entire series.  I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone who can appreciate the science OR the beauty of nature.

I'm hoping for an update of the original movie.

1594488843|4.0|Daniel Pink identifies distinctions between Motivation 2.0 and Motivation 3.0 by highlighting - Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. The fundamental shift that Drive addresses is whether you believe folks should be controlled/managed in the workplace or liberated/coached to tap into their own and each other's intrinsic motivations. I share Pink's belief that when we engage folks with appreciative and participative processes that honor the best of who they are - we receive exceptional results that are collaborative and sustainable. Drive invites us to think about motivation differently by thinking about people differently. I welcome the shift!
006145205X|4.0|Matt Ridley is a great science writer and has established himself in an evolutionary niche, having written books about the human genome, the Red Queen Effect, and social cooperation.  'The Rational Optimist' is still an evolutionary work, as Mr. Ridley spends quite a bit of text on human evolution and the importance of trade, but he also takes a fresh perspective on much of the pessimistic thinking that exists in today's public domain, everything from our diet to global warming, and he comes out seeing smiley faces where most are preaching doom and gloom.  So the story begins with humanity as any number of small, isolated groups stuck in a technological stasis of rudimentary stone tools.  Then, due to a favorable climatological period, humanity became denser on the ground and contact between groups occurred.  Trading began, say ten fish for a hand axe, and then the maker of the hand axes found that she didn't need to fish anymore, and so specialized entirely in axes, and made design improvements.  Matt Ridley pretty much states that gene-culture coevolution is ultimately a product of trade, and yes, the most natural form of trade is capitalistic, and if the first humans were communists, we would still be living in caves! (No Ridley didn't say that, but I think it's funny.)  It is tough for a warm, fuzzy, optimistic message to make any headway in the current media climate, it is far easier for global warming pessimists, oil-is-gonna-run-out predicters, grey gooers, asteroid colliders and any number of les miserables to grab pixels.  Some magazines that were printing global cooling articles during the 1970s are now huge warming advocates.  It is certainly interesting to hear the other side of the debate on, well, almost everything, as I have been a strong advocate for warming, organic food, and renewable energy myself.  Mr. Ridley insists that humanity is getting smarter and has figures showing something like a 5 point improvement per decade, mainly in the lower end of the scores, but that makes us collectively smarter; try that one on a room full of pessimists: \\"The smart are getting smarter, and the dumb are getting dumber,\\" said one.  Turn on any news channel, open a magazine or a newspaper if there are any still in print, and you will find that the end is nigh via any number of gloomy scenarios, while at the same time admit that average lifespans DOUBLED during the twentieth century, the Cuyahoga River no longer catches fire, we stopped emitting CFCs and sulfur dioxide, and produce more food on less land.  Yes, Mr. Ridley does come off as a touch on the sunny side, glossing over problems like receding polar ice, and his smile has an edge to it when he describes the \\"Lord High Priests of Organic,\\" decrying their disdain for genetically modified foods.  Hey, you can be optimistic all you want, but when a company like Monsanto controls something like 90% of the seed supply and casually introduces a nasty innovation called a terminator gene, that doesn't give me much faith in humanity (terminator genes prevent farmers from reusing seeds as the plant is automatically Schwarzeneggered.  Monsanto insists that the gene cannot find its way into wild plants, :( [oops pessimism in an optimistic review.])  There is plenty of material here, Ridley blasts biofuels, proving their inefficiency, mentions that a nuke plant can supply all of your life's energy requirements while producing only enough waste to fill a soda can (hey check the facts, I have,) and he discusses a wind farm in California that kills 24 golden eagles annually.  In the end there is much to think about (everything), and other books to leaven Mr. Ridley's message with if you want to; Michael Pollan's 'The Omnivore's Dilemma' makes a brilliant case for organic farming, and 'Twelve by Twelve' by William Powers advocates a blissful return to a simpler lifestyle.  So perhaps you the reader can pick your own path between contradictory viewpoints, hopefully a path that is bothrational and optimistic.

I enjoyed the way he depicted the woods. I love how the special something or evil lurking was not completely revealed until close to the end. I found the nine year old girl's perspective plausible. I felt her despair and her weakening health. It was a great read.

The basic plot is Marv this sum what mentally ill thug who has the time of his life with a woman named Goldie who was the first person to be nice to him besides his mother.

B001HN69AY|4.0|Not at all \\"artsy\\" or pretentious, this playful twist on that age-old cautionary tale (I'll leave it to you to figure out which one) seems to have offended both lowbrow and highbrow viewers alike.  At times style does threaten to overwhelm substance and while the film itself doesn't suffer for it, the tragedy behind the production tainted the experience for me, if only slightly.  Still, it succeeded in putting a smile on my face and I suspect that is precisely what it was meant to do.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|There is not too much i can say about this album that has not already been stated. So briefly- The beats and rhythms are amazing. The collaborations (although a bit of a surprise) are well picked. And the similes and metaphors always have a second meaning behind them. If you pay attention to the songs, they reference many current and past events, but not by simply saying it. Great album 110/100 points because you will listen to it many many times and find something new each time.

I have decided to buy the regular albums vs. a greatest hits cd, because I expect the remastering quality to be better than a many generation duplicate remaster.  and you sometimes find hidden gems that might not make it to a greatest hits CD.  a couple songs I forgot about from \\"the mac\\" were \\"monday morning\\" \\"warm ways\\" and \\"crystal\\".  this CD also has 5 bonus tracks with 3 singles mixes and a \\"jam\\" and extra song \\"blues letter\\" single maybe unreleased?<br /><br />these were the golden years for fleetwood mac in my opinion....if you like the hits and like to hear them over and over, maybe you'd like some of the other tracks!<br /><br />I do!<br /><br />p.s. check out allmusic dot com for music reviews, not perfect for everyone, but a place to start to find some good music!!!

6304806418|5.0|Evita is an excellent movie, with great music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and probably the best thing Madonna has ever done!  The performances are very, very good; Madonna is spectacular as Eva Peron, and this was one of the first vehicles to prove that Madonna really CAN sing... very well!  Antonio Banderas as Che is perfect for the part of the \\"everyman\\", a sort of narrator to the story.  Most of the lyrics (dialog) are easy to understand, except for some of the choral (group) selections.<br /><br />This movie is greatly underrated and under-recognized as a work of cinematic art.  It's really strange that it hasn't been remastered onto Blu-Ray, but the DVD version is excellent quality.<br /><br />Be warned, however... Evita is basically an opera (performed in English); there is very little spoken dialog.  My wife and I love Evita, and we don't hesitate to recommend it to ALMOST everyone.

0785134352|3.0|Kick-Ass (2010), written by Mark Millar and illustrated by John Romita, Jr., collects the full initial run, issues 1-8, of the eponymous Marvel comic. Here, Dave Lizewski, a regular, unremarkable teenager, becomes a \\"real-life\\" superhero, a job for which he is dangerously ill-equipped.<br /><br />Millar's premise is to look at what \\"real\\" superheroes might be like, psychologically and in practice. And that's fine, except that he quickly takes things way over the top and progressively introduces more ludicrous elements, notably Big Daddy (a poor man's Punisher - if you somehow didn't get it, Millar makes the connection for you several times) and Hit-Girl (a ten-year-old ninja who single-handedly takes the entire comic and transplants it squarely to the realm of the ridiculous).<br /><br />If Millar had stuck to answering the question, \\"What would a `real' superhero look like?\\" Kick-Ass would have better. But what's \\"real\\" about this except that the \\"heroes\\" get beat up all the time, and that they're all mentally disturbed on some level? Not much. By the end, in too many ways, Kick-Ass is just another comic book.<br /><br />Millar makes a point to turn as many comic tropes on their ears as he can, particularly the Peter Parker-in-high-school ones. But it all tends to be too self-aware, and Kick-Ass often reads like a hyper-violent version of Brian Michael Bendis's Ultimate Spider-Man (if Peter regularly monologued about his sexual frustration). It doesn't help that Millar's writing isn't nearly as clever as he seems to think it is, and a number of his innumerable comic book references feel downright amateurish.<br /><br />The characters aren't great - Dave is a generally unsympathetic horny teenager who does stupid things - and nobody else gets much development. The plot is decent, although none of its \\"twists\\" is particularly surprising. Millar also tends to gloss over or outright ignore any story elements that would keep things from moving at a brisk pace.<br /><br />2003's Wanted told us loudly and clearly that for Millar, there's really no such thing as bad taste, and he reinforces that understanding here. Under Marvel's Max label, he's free to be as vulgar and gratuitous as he wants to be on every page (and usually is). It's like Millar can't restrain himself, can't keep himself from going over the top whenever and however he can, and it really limits what Kick-Ass could have become.<br /><br />Romita's art is great as always, with one exception. Hit-Girl never looks right - her proportions are distracting, as she's basically a gigantic head on a tiny stick body. Romita does a solid job with the degree of violence (this level of gore isn't something we're used to seeing from him), although some of Hit-Girl's dismemberments get pretty out there.<br /><br />On the whole, Kick-Ass is readable but mediocre because it's more interested in being a violence-porn version of mainstream comics than in exploring the more realistic themes that it merely plays at.learly that for Millar, there's really no such thing as bad taste, and he reinforces that understanding here. Under Marvel's Max label, he's free to be as vulgar and gratuitous as he wants to be on every page (and usually is). It's like Millar can't restrain himself, can't keep himself from going over the top whenever and however he can, and it really limits what Kick-Ass could have become.    Romita's art is great as always, with one exception. Hit-Girl never looks right - her proportions are distracting, as she's basically a gigantic head on a tiny stick body.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|I like this album so far, but Eminem albums take time to digest.  I'm still in the early stages.  The one question I have is why doesn't Dr. Dre do any rapping?    Marshall and Dre are like Peanut Butter and Jelly.  They just go together.    While Relapse wasn't an overall great album it has some killer songs including Old Time's Sake with Dr. Dre.    I wonder if Eminem will do anything on Detox?
B00338QENI|1.0|This family is NOT worth reading about. The father belongs in jail for what he LET happen to his kids. Disease ridden family in more ways than one. These people made really bad life choices and want everyone to feel sorry for them. Their focus on Henrietta is strictly monetary. Poor woman!! Waste of my time.
0061689246|5.0|Adults deserve good fairy tales, too ~Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />I have trouble being honest and critical with a well written book.  Someone like Gaiman, in all his work so far, is able to create a world and characters that just pull you in and don't let you go.  He is able to create the myths that make me suspend disbelief and the critical and writerly mind and just let go.<br /><br />He does it here in _Stardust_.  I have nothing to add in terms of the conflict or the characters because I lived and interacted with them.  Books like this remind me why I loved reading so much when I was younger, before I sucked all the fun out by going to graduate school.  Perhaps the resolution was telepgraphed to the reader, but that only comes out on reflection.  Go get everything he's ever written, and remind yourself why you liked reading too.<br /><br />We deserve good fairy tales, and we get them from Neil Gaiman.  Thank you Neil.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Afterglow by Sarah Mclachlan is very unique in the sense is not dull but it is willing to take risks especially with the song \\"Answer\\" it is so haunting and beatiful I dare anyone not feel but sentimental and cry a little.  If you are asking where did I hear that song it is in the movie \\"The Brave One\\" with Jodie Foster.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The Box itself is wonderful and all the blu-ray discs are in excelent quality. Just started watching the trilogy once more and you can definitely see a HUGE difference between blu-ray and DVD. all the additional info is a massive bonus. all in all a super great buy!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|There are no more superlatives left to describe AVATAR, so I'll go straight to the DVD experience. Okay, it's not IMAX and 3D, but having the DVD on a large plasma at home, assuming you have a decent sound system, can pull you into the magic on an even more intimate level. The giant theater screen, while very involving, is overwhelming. Now you notice more of the peripheral details. You can switch on the captioning to catch dialog you missed. You can zoom, reverse, and other stuff to enhance understanding of the faster action sequences. Best of all, since it's a LONG movie, you can pause to potty. So don't pass up home viewing fearing a let-down. It won't be.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|The item was fantastic quality and the show is worth watching (and watching, and watching).
B002RVZV9K|5.0|very well produced...great musicians    if you enjoy the guitar or rock at all, you will like this
1932100660|5.0|Wow! A paradigm shift away from mainstream ideas on nutrition. Very threatening to some -- many will not be ready to read this and reject it's premise out of fear. If you read and enjoyed Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma, then you may be ready for this book. This book is a must if you are intrested in taking control of your health in the best way possible -- your diet.
0316113077|5.0|This book is really educational.  The pictures are clear and the instructions are easy to follow.  This is a must for every cake decorator.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell's insights are always fun and interesting to read and Outliers is no exception. His thought-provoking ideas are a must read for any entrepreneur, lawyer, pilot, educator, genius, parent or anyone interested in challenging their preconceived notions of success (and failure for that matter).
0061122416|3.0|The book started off well and I liked the boy's 'journey' to his desired destination. I enjoyed reading about Oasis and about rules of war. Considering the book is less than 100 pages, it lacked depth. Towards the end yeah it got a little over the top with talking to wind etc. Anyway, I think it was decent read, but nothing great.
0393324818|5.0|Indicative of his best-selling ability, Michael Lewis is a wonderful storyteller. Even non-sports fans or non-baseball fans could enjoy the fascinating story about how a MLB underdog finds a way to win. In this case it's the Oakland A's competing, and often beating, the deep-pocketed MLB teams like the NY Yankees. Billy Beane is a strange character who runs the A's team (as General Manager) more like a science experiment than a traditional baseball franchise and the players are his unsuspecting lab rats. Interestingly, the dynamic personality of Billy Beane is set to be played by Brad Pitt in the off-again, on-again movie production of Moneyball.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|instead of taking their time and doing the job right.. .they did a quick rush job to get it on shelves... i was looking for the whole super fly home theatre experience, and this just bombed.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|Judas Priest is one of my all time favorite bands and British Steel is my favorite album. I already had both the original vinyl album and the CD of this record but I bought this for the concert DVD in which they play every song on the album in order. It didn't disappoint me; the quality is excellent! I would highly recommend this to any Judas Priest fan or classic metal fan.
B002HWUU2C|5.0|What's not to like about this?  Beautiful harmonies, wonderful contrast between Irglova and Hansard, and memorable songs.  I have loved The Swell Season since discovering the film Once, and continue to be delighted and thrilled.  There are a few artists out there that deliver a complete package of great lyrics, harmony, and memorability, and I would put Glen Hansard (both in his Frames and Swell Season work) in that category.  Deserves a lot more commercial success than he has seen (though doesn't seem like he has done too badly).      As a funny side note, my kids (5 and 3) love this CD too.  Left it in one day in the car, and they ask for it al the tie.  :)  Not the most age appropriate, I know, but still it is too funny.  Probably an indication of how good it is!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|i was very pleased with the movie , heath ledger did a outstanding job as the joker that will be hard to replace. the quality of the blu-ray was superb. i'd recommend it to all movie watchers.
1433502410|5.0|This Bible exceeds my expectations.  It is easy to understand and the commentaries are very enlightening.  Maps,concordance and so much more in one volume is so handy.  I would recommend this to all serious students of the Bible.
B0035G9ABQ|3.0|It's not as if this album doesnt have some tight tracks, or anything. My main problem with this one is that the album does not feel entirely inspired or interesting. I can appreciate the variety in sounds and vibes and such... but I am always left disappointed at the end of most songs.       The album's strongest tracks are, in my opinion, \\"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach,\\" \\"Rhinestone Eyes,\\" \\"Stylo,\\" \\"Empire Ants,\\" and the title track. To its credit, it does have the genuine Gorillaz style that is a rather unique sound. If you've followed this group (or is it one guy?), you'll know what Im talking about.      My assumption, when building a strong album, is you have a few tracks in the beginning to grab the attention and interest of the listener, set in some good songs to add some texture and spirit to the overall package, and then finish strong with something a little prolific or... well, just a solid song. Not only am I not engaged within the first two or three songs, but after the second song (one of my favorites), it goes back into this very drawn out and dull song. Whatever interest that was built with the first and second pieces, is immediately lost within the third one. And the last half of songs aint much neither.      It really is a shame that Gorillaz cant really nail it with this one. I thought they were VERY close with Demon Days, and all they needed to do was come up with some more inspired material. Perhaps this is the maximum of their creative abilities. I dont find much in this album that would promise, or hint, at any sort of improvement in the future. I know that sounds harsh, however, I am very confident that a majority of listeners out there would agree that this album just doesnt cut it. I know they're better than this... It's a shame that Demon Days may have been their peak. Ill be on the lookout for the next, with my enthusiasm curbed.
B003405MF6|5.0|In his 6th decade this 'guitarist's guitarist' continues to stretch the boundaries of possibility with his continued mastery of technique, tone, subtlety and intrigue.      One of the few artists that is a 'must see' on tour, just to truly appreciate that what you heard on the album was actually possible.    Thanks Jeff for continuing to get better with age.  Truly amazing!
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I didn't think I could enjoy Eclipse as much as I did New Moon.  However, to my absolute delight Eclipse eclipsed the New Moon soundtrack.  The songs and performances are intense.  My top favs are: Neutron Star Collision, Heavy in Your Arms, My Love, Chop & Change, Let's get Lost, to name a few. I just love this CD.
B000063DHL|5.0|This album is amazing, it captivates you from the beginning to the end.  If you love Iron Maiden's story telling style you'll love this album.  If you love just the meaningless lyrics of others you'll still be dumbfounded by Maiden's musical prowness.  Wasted Years and Stranger in a Strange Land are amazing...even songs like Lonliness of a Long Distance Runner seems stupid when you hear the title, but when you hear the way the band puts emotion into the song you can imagine running till the pain overtakes you into somewhere else.  Tight band, hasn't been better since.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Who could not embrace this soundtrack from the first Twight saga.  It sets the tone for all the romance and angst to come.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|The product was very neatly packaged and was delivered in a few days. I was very pleased.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Somebody got paid to make/produce this movie?<br /><br />Im in the wrong business.<br /><br />Was this supposed to be scary?<br /><br />Have a plot?<br /><br />Be interesting?<br /><br />Be entertaining?<br /><br />86 minutes felt like 4 hours of whatching..er...um..well, I'm not sure what to call it.<br /><br />Movies like this are why AMZN needs a 'negative review rating' as it is not deserving of even a single star. Others may like it and I think thats great. But, I cant say I did and I normally really like these type flicks, although I also thought Blair Witch was pitiful. I rank this higher then Blair Witch, but that still aint saying much.
1433502410|5.0|This contemporary study guide is chocked full of pictures and concise information about passages. Sometimes there is brevity in the depth of the commentary throughout the chapter, but to go further would sacrifice the wide audience this is intended for. Each chapter begins with several pages on background and history and concludes with a summary outline of the book you're about to read. There is plenty of history about the bible, the old and new testament, and various other concerns addressed in chapters in the beginning and end of the book. Overall, the most concise ESV guide I could find, and wonderful pictures to add to your understanding.
