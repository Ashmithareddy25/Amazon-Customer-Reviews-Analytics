B0094MFI52|4.0|Yes, Robin Williams is not in this one but for whatever it lacks in his humor and the excitement of Jumanji, it still has enough charm to keep it going. Great for kids born after Jumanji was released.
B004XJNPAQ|5.0|This is a good action flick, Nicholas cage is at his action best. I do like the guy who is sent from hell to drag Nicholas Cage back, I agree with another reviewer that he almost steals the show. The eye candy female is no sweet little thing, which makes her a lot of fun. There is a sex scene in which Nicholas shoots a lot of men dead while having sex, macbre and funny. The picture quality is excellent, sound is excellent.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Anything Marvel, I love it. This was a great movic for the comic heads, and having them all come to life it was great
B0038NN3B4|5.0|A very informative book.  I had the first edition and really like this addition as well.  May buy the recipe book next.
B007FH22VQ|5.0|I've always listened to Meshuggah, picking and choosing my favorite songs, but I've never really liked any whole album. I've listened to Chaosphere more than anything, but then Koloss comes along. This album as a whole is the most mature album from Meshuggah yet. From start to finish, the whole album is an exciting listen. Demiurge has been stuck in my head, and crawling under my skin, and I can't stop listening. Obzen was a stepping stone to this one, and if Meshuggah keeps this quality up, they can only get better.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I love this story and always have, so I'm biased.  I've watched this movie year round.  I believe ... I believe
B00338QENI|4.0|I was taking a microbiology course and read about hela, and also remembered the book.  Several people saw it on my Kindle and told me they had enjoyed it. Having grown up in Baltimore and having been to Hopkins and driven past the Turner's Station area when leaving the highway (just like she described in the book) I had an added interest.  I thought the scientific portion was described perfectly, not too technical but interesting enough for someone without a scientific background.  The descriptions of the family were very vivid and gave us a good insight as to the hurt and anger they felt, justifiably so.  Should they have been compensated when the tissue was removed legally (at the time) while Henrietta was being treated at a free clinic...personally I think not.  It may have been in their best interests that they had never learned of the process.  So many other tissues and cells were used, it just happened that hers lived.  And none of this would have been possible without the work of dedicated scientists.  But the cruelest irony is that Deborah and her brothers, who suffered from so many illnesses, could not even receive proper medical care.  You would think that the hospital or medical/scientific community could have at least offered that. Good read, although it seemed to have ended somewhat abruptly.
B001TODCII|5.0|The moral of the story is clear:  A father will do anything for his child ... so I got a copy for each of my children.  This is one of the few movies that's not a Christmas or war movie that I have watched repeatedly.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I am so saddened that Ms. Harris choose to end the series in the way she did.  It was cold, unfeeling and horribly disappointing.  I read an article that she knew her readers would like the way it ends, so I am confused on why she ended the series like she did.  That said, anyone who had read the series owes it to themselves to read the book despite the reviews it is getting.<br /><br />So long Sookie, it was great knowing you!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The best story and music put to screen in the last 40 years. A true classic that everyone must own!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I think this is a great tool to store things of interest.  However, it is somewhat unfriendly to a new user, even one who considers themself good with computers. The android app is even less so. I am sure with time it will become easier, but I don't use it as much as I would like for this reason.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|As an artist i am almost always exploring ideas. This app fits the bill I have it on my Android phone and on my tablet. I dont go anywhere without my phone and when an idea hits me it takes just a short time to lay out the idea on the phone. I save it for later review and if it still interist me I can send it to my tablet for refineing or to my computer,via email. It works for me. On the down side it took me about a week to learn how to inport, expotr and other actions the app is capeable of. All and all it is worth the down load and even for the casual doodler it can be fun.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|The Kindle reader doesn't allow me to access/use my books on multiple platforms.  Since I mostly buy technical manuals I need a reader that will allow me to study from my phone or tablet and access the books from my PC where the real work is done.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love it super easy to use and just full of interesting info!<br />wish they had an app pertaining to real life! 2 hours till sleep
1400064287|5.0|This book breaks down effective messaging so well that I change a number of my writing techniques based on the introduction alone.<br />After the first chapter the rest of the book is dedicated to reinforcing the techniques.<br />For myself I can see the value of the book applying to many years of future works.
B004H1V5RU|2.0|If it gets dented you cannot pop the dome back out although I've considered taking it to the local auto body shop.........
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Fabulous acting, wonderful story...sad, courageous, and funny w/ a happy ending!  Oddly, I know a family that this story mirrored w/ the same happy ending!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|My discs are wearing out.  I have watched and enjoyed this movie more times than I'd like to admit.  I just identify so much with the Navi people.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is such a sad disease and hard to think about it happening to someone you love.  Well written story....
B00957T6X6|5.0|Great books - got interested through the HBO series then decided I didn't want to wait for each weekly episode.  It is pretty cool to compare how my head sees it when I read to how they portray it on the semi-big screen.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|While the storyline is a little thin, the combination of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway is &#34;just what the doctor ordered&#34;.  He is cool and handsome, she is sexy as she can be.....in the end you are so happy for both of them, despite the sadness.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|What else can I say. It's a Kindle plug! It does what it's suppose to do and nothing more and nothing less.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I Loved it and can't wait for sequel. I Especially loved Jennifer Lawrence.<br />She is polished and amazingly mature at her young age.
B001AQR39O|5.0|If you love this show then you will love this season.  His life is the classic train wreck you can't take your eyes off of.
B0007TKH66|4.0|While many had mixed feelings and thoughts overall on this series of the Sta Trek Universe franchise it wasn't as terrible nor was it as detrimental to the franchise as many said as it gave a more grittier and earlier look at what was going on before the creation of Starfleet and the Federation. If I have any real complaint it's that it negates a lot of what was written or what happen when you connect the story from this series to the 1960's Star Trek, case in point while many of this generation have grown used to Klingons with warped forehead skull ridges and the like the 60's version were in fact more human and no stronger then humans with the exception of being more militaristic in their government. Still looking pas t these mixed feelings and facts between the two the series still gave us a more somewhat realistic look of how it was when humanity began its deep space exploration thanks due to the discovery of warp drive technology though while the Vulcans while helping still feel humanity lacks the level headiness and emotional control to begin this trek man starts the exploration anyway.  The crew are a a nice intermix of cast and characters who fit the series nicely especially and somewhat surprisingly Scott Bakula as the newly made captain of the interstellar Ship Enterprise as for so long I've just seen this actor as more on the lighter and more comedic roles then anything else but he pulls of this role pretty well.<br /><br />The video and clear and sharp and since it's one and somewhat sadly the last of the franchise to be released on t.v. around 2000 the series is in widescreen format instead of standard format like with the previous series released before it.The audio is also clear and sharp no audio distortions to mention,the extras are decent but I don't really concern myself with those most times. So for sci-fans or Star Trek fans here's another decent series to add to your library at a affordable price to enjoy whenever you wish.
B005F3GMAO|5.0|Richard Branson shows you that if you put your mind and heart into something no matter how hard it may be, and if you follow your instinct and never give up, the sky is the limit! In this book he describes his life from the beginning, his fall backs and all the successes he had, with an insight on how he managed to accomplish everything. He is the true meaning of an entrepreneur!
B001FGDFB4|5.0|I have always enjoyed this book and enjoyed the movie as well. I remember reading it back in high school and really fell in love. I read it twice.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I Love NCIS and when the power went out because of the storms I was able to download the missed episode on amazon.  So I was a happy woman.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|What a great musical with great music and meaning behind each song. Hopefully I'll get to see the Broadway musical in person one day!
B00932A4XE|4.0|Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours. Although he only had a small part in the movie, Chris Rock's character was pretty hilarious. We are also expecting so we had a lot of laughs identifying with the characters.
B00BAB6CNC|2.0|Before I get &#34;flamed&#34; by anybody let me state that I LOVE Slipknot and I used to love Stone Sour. Corey Taylor has been my favorite singer since I first heard him in Slipknot 14 years ago!! I have seen Slipknot in concert 5 times and Stone Sour twice.<br /><br />BUT guess what? Stone Sour's House of Gold and Bones and HOGB part 2 Are almost Terrible!! Seriously what happened?? It's almost like a bad joke here. Corey has been So busy the last few years I don't see how he had any time to even write these albums and IT SHOWS!! I TRIED to like them I really did, but i can't!! The first HOGB has maybe 3 songs that are played on the radio and they are the Only good ones on it, this HOGB part 2 has maybe 1 song I can even listen to without cringing at how FORCED the lyrics and tone are. Even ALL of my friends Share the same sentiment as I do about this record, Not some, ALL!!<br /><br />But to be honest I haven't forced myself to listen to this cd over and over yet. I've listened through maybe 5 times. And I had, Had enough. Sorry Stone Sour, you are going to have to do better then this. And Corey, when you finally get to writing a New Slipknot PLEASE take your time, do whatever it takes to make sure that it is NOT as horrible as these HOGB records are!!<br /><br />Sorry Corey, Stone Sour, I cannot give this a good rating, etc. it's borderline Terrible!! Especially if you are used to the product that Corey and Stone Sour have put out in the past. I'm only giving it a 2 star because I'm a fan otherwise it would be a 1. Word is that Corey is supposedly writing on a new Slipknot album now. Let's only hope that when Corey finally gets to recording a New Slipknot that it erases the memory of this Tragedy!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Slow to start, but becamevery, very good.  Grisham had terrific insight into both the legal and prison systems in the US despite the book being a fiction.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Let me say that I love James Bond and Daniel Craig's take on the character. I also love this movie, However it just seems to have an area that lags fairly long during the middle of the movie until maybe the last half hour. And this is why I cannot give the movie a 5 star rating and it gets a 4 instead.
0307341577|4.0|Although there were some gruesome scenes in this book (which I could've done without, but I guess it got the point across), I couldn't put this book down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Gillian does an excellent job of creating &#34;real&#34; characters - the characters are people with flaws, and some of them aren't particularly likeable, especially (for me) the main character. I read this for my book club, and it made for an interesting discussion as we all had different viewpoints of what spurred the events that happened.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is absolutely the best game of this genre. Plays very well on my Kindle Fire HD. I highly recommend this game.
1844257797|5.0|Great product for the owner of a R1150RT.  Gives you insight and photos on a maintenance and repairs of the R engine and models.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Every episodes makes me wonder how creative the writers must be to be able to come up with this stuff.  Then I realize they're the same writers from LOST. Excellent!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Romantic, crazy-but not too over the top, and all around charming! The characters are sincere and you will easily fall in love with them. Great Film!
1451695195|5.0|buying copies for my relatives and friends.  gives one reassurance of the hereafter, which is a good thing. Amen amen
193700788X|1.0|I am a big fan of the Sookie Stackhouse Novels and I have to say this was the worst one.  I am sorry she ended the series the way she did.  I would have hoped for more of a twist and a bigger ending.  If you are a fan you are going to read it regardless of the reviews you read but wait for it to go on sale or for free cause it is not worth the money.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|The movie was ok, but, I guess, after &#34;L.A.&#34; and a couple of other movies, it seems like a retread. Ryan Gosling was the &#34;eye candy&#34; for the ladies. He was there so your sweetie pie will watch a shoot-em-up with you. I felt that his character was kind of silly. Shame, because he is a talented actor. Josh Brolin was good as was the rest of the cast.
B000065U1N|5.0|I have seen this movie on tv and wanted a copy to watch at my leisure. Great acting and action.

B007RCJNDE|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has made an excellent finish to Robert Jordan's series, there is room for a sequel at some future time, but the series can be left as is with all loose ends tied up.
B007F7XXKA|4.0|This is a good book of emergin markets , very clear . I agree with the author about some of the posible outcomes ...The fact that he didn't take into account the perilous road ahead, I men : Euro and US_china rebalancing it's a major flaw .
B005IGVYUG|3.0|I have all Tom Waits albums. This one is not his best. I still love Tom! Looking forward to his next one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app for my 5 year old daughter, but find myself playing it with her asking when is it going to be her turn! Very addictive! Never thought this would be a game I would be hooked on!
B008JFUO36|3.0|I will skip a long review as I have seen many good ones that say would I would say. I will add that I felt this film had a few too many unrealistic events that just do not work. I still liked the film and had fun seeing it. I would have gone for a bleaker ending but that is not the hollywood way in most cases. See it and you will have a good time. Well that is it for my first review. I do a longer one for Star Trek.
B00171EO0I|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  I have watched it at least 10 times and cry every time.  How can you go wrong with Gerard Butler!!!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Very cute movie, with a few laugh out loud moments. I also liked the thought provoking theme presented in the first minute of the movie.  So true!  The conclusion also so true.....great life lesson.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|With traveling so much it is nice to be able to have this app on my kindle and not just on my phone.  I went with the Kindle fire over the ipad because it does all that I need it to do and with apps like this it is even better
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Turn off your phones, disconnect email and abandon Facebook. Lock your doors and windows. Then settle in for the final and best book in this outstanding series.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson writes as though possessed by Robert Jordan and the result is exactly what you might hope. This is a fast paced, roller coaster ride with some wild twists and turns. A fitting final chapter in the best fantasy series since Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Don't think about it. Just read it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My only regret about this game is that it flies by so fast. Does anyone know if/when the sequel will be coming out? Don't pass up this game, it's clever, makes you think, and all for the low, low price of free!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wonderful characters, beautiful setting, great costuming!  A good story that makes you want to see what happens in the next season.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesomely written. Several settings of the book are familiar to me for having lived in those areas mentioned in it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you like like your science fiction with a capital S, you will love this book. The story is gripping and the writing is sharp and witty. Can't praise it enough.
0385344333|5.0|I have always loved Lee Child's \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels and this one didn't disappoint.  I found even more evidence of the humanizing of this character and recommend it to all.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Well, after this book I took to minimalist/barefoot running and gave away all my thick-soled trainers. It´s been 2 years ago, and since then I haven´t had knee pains nor back pains. But if you are not a runner you´ll also be thrilled with the adventures of Caballo Blanco and the haramuri, and a lot of other colorful characters.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Left me hanging have to get the next set to find out how it finishes out . One story or set of books i could not put down
B005LW5J9O|3.0|This book opens a big window over an age when free-thinking was cornered by religion. I sometimes got bored through it, but that´s because I´m a brute, not a scholar.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|my granddaughter liked these the best she began naming the princesses and she really enjoyed these the most would buy again they were great!
B000FC0OOU|5.0|The title says everything, I guess. A genius being genial. Like when one listens to certain musicians and realizes that he´s not merely listening, he´s going through an experience. Go for it!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Each page asks a question and you are compelled to keep reading to find out.  Of course that brings up more questions and more reading!  What more can a book lover ask?
B002QRWJA4|5.0|My daughter just had to see it. We had owned it and lost it. She loves this movie. She told us we have to buy another one.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Really nice game for kids and adults, I guess it teaches patience to kids and is very relaxing to adults. Beautiful graphics, and the music is soothing.  Catmom13
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I loved it, but it couldn't stand up to what I hoped for. There were quite a few moments that made my heart constrict. Well done.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We loved this movie in the theater and are so glad we have purchased it for our home library. Good value.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is so much fun! I generally like all things created by g5 entertainment, and they have not failed to entertain!
B008QLXSG8|5.0|It's one of the most beautiful novels I've ever read. Its a joy and a wonder to be able to read it once, twice, a number of times because you always find something new in it and is propelled to think about oneself in this crazy world. It's incredible how actual the novel is. Camus is one of the best writers of the last century. He's a rare case of a well deserved Nobel Prize.
B00768D664|5.0|This book was requirement for my MBA. It has some great tactics for picking stocks in various markets. Peter tells his stories and gives advice for anyone just starting out in the equities market. It's written for anyone of average intelligence or above. The book is not bogged down with language or terms that only insiders understand.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If I had waited another week I could have viewed<br />it for free OnDemand.  But the connection was good<br />and the streaming only had a couple of minor hiccups.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This story rates right up there with &#34;The Lion&#34; and is a must read! DeMille is at his best in these stories and spins a tale that will pull you in from the get-go. Highly recommended!
B00181JGI2|5.0|Great hysterical movie! Must see! So many great lines. Julianne Moore was fantastic. Other actors great too. Laughed out loud
B007MB5OCE|5.0|An utter delight!  Like Zelig on steroids.  I recommend this to anyone.  unless you are a curmudgeon of the first order.
B00913DPW2|2.0|I have played many of these games and always enjoy completing them but this one was way too difficult. I had to print the walkthrough and still could not finish the game because I do not have a Facebook account. Very disappointed in this game.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I love this series but i just didn't like the ending, it was okay, it has to end in something but it was not what i was expecting from Mrs Harris, is like she did it just because she had to do it, i loved the last 12 books, this one, no, i don't like it. i understand why she end it like that but i thought Sookie was going to fight, she didn't. i don't know. i just don't love it like the rest of the series.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|The songs on this cd are incredible. Great songs great music and a great singer! I have been a Rod Stewart fan for many years. I used to sing along with his songs in the car. My oldest son was just around 2 or 3 and A Reason to Believe was playing and I heard his sweet little voice singing. He was singing a raisin to believe.  Years letter he would give me an Ipod with Raisin to Believe engraved on it.  Rod Stewart is awesome.  My sons gave me the cd \\"Time\\" as an early mother's day present. I haven't stopped listening yet.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This would be a good book for my book discussion group.  I think there would be a lot to talk about.  I did find it confusing in places because of the jumping around.  But, admittedly, my reading was interrupted several times.  The ending did come as a surprise to me.  Recommend reading it continually and not putting it down to read other books as I did.  If my group takes this book on, I will read it again.
B00957T6X6|3.0|Much to long. Did not have any closure. Must be another book. Killed too many of the main characters. What happened?
B000SEFCD8|3.0|I read a review in Amazon that recommended this book over Elizabeth Marshall Thomas' The Social Life of Dogs.  Although The Other End of the Leash had a lot of good information, there was nothing special about the author's writing skills.  I downloaded it on my Kindle and have to keep reminding myself to read a little more, not that it doesn't contain good information, I didn't find it held my attention.  Thomas' book is a whole 'nother thing.  It is beautifully written and I couldn't put it down.  Underlying the clinical observations were  feeling, sensitivity and sometimes passion.  There was also an undercurrent of spirituality not present in her Hidden Life of Dogs.  McConnell's book is certainly worth reading for the useful information, but Thomas' book knocked my socks off.
B001P1MZNI|3.0|Great versions of songs that can be found elsewhere but if you're playing it thru a good stereo, be aware that the sound quality isn't what you might be hoping for.  Not surprising considering the age of the recording; just be forewarned.
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|It seems Joe's work gets more divisive with time. I can't fault people for having different tastes, but I for one am all over this album. I listened twice and decided it's a five-star work after the second listen. Great sound, great songs, great playing, and great melody all add up to what I find to be a great album. I certainly can't tell you whether you'll enjoy this like I did or be bored with it like others have been; all I can say is listen to the samples to decide if you want to buy.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I went through 4 of these in 2 yrs. I thought with the first one that maybe it wasn't soldered properly. The second one had the same problem after six months. When it started shorting out I just took it back to Wal-Mart and exchanged it for #3. Same with #3 which I babied. With #4 I went to exchange and they were out of stock, so I payed extra and got the ps3 Wireless Headset and never had another problem. 2yrs and counting...still satisfied.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have it on my phone and it works wonderful. I can take my books anywhere with me. I really like it.
0380807343|5.0|If you're not familiar with Gaiman books, he can throw in some creepy things that stay with you for a long time, especially in his short stories. This is a very adult children's book, so definitely don't pick it for a relaxing bedtime story. Read it during daylight, and be prepared for your kids to be fascinated in a freaked out way.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Maximum Movie Madness, perfect film for those who want to see cinematic magic, imagination and execution.<br />Great special effects, great story, great production.  A film for all, a film for all time.<br />A movie that takes you far away to a very special place.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot like temple run but in many ways its better. I also like the fact that there Is a lot of characters to choose from.
0515153656|5.0|Jack Reacher gets under your skin (in a good way) and you want him to be your friend for life.  He is an understated hero, but he gets things done.  I am thoroughly enjoying reading this book and look forward to the next one on my list.
B00867GHS8|5.0|this is great to watch on the 3d tv, the show is even better what a difference. I cant wait for finding Dori to come out.
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|Another poor script. Why we seldom watch new films produced in the US. Hollywood needs to relearn how to make movies.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|too many collections of algae and repitious movements in the program. once I plant some coral or plants they shoud produce automaticly.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|I personally don't care for Adam Sandler, but in this case, since I didn't have to look at him, he did OK in simply following a script.<br />He should make all his movies this way so he doesn't turn his audience off
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|the 6 year old loved it and squealed when she opened the package she looks forward to using them in her new room
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I'm sorry hackel, but I actually LIKE this game. I'm only 11, and I don't know who the crap liquid entertainment is,  BUT THIS IS A AWESOME GAME!!!

0920668372|5.0|First heard this book at my daughters 1st grade Mother's Day program. Dear Mrs Person read the book story and all the kids did the responsive &#34;I'll love you forever&#34; chorus. Not a dry Mothers eyes by the end! It has been my kids and my end to conversations since then, over 20 years! 'I'll Love You Forever&#34; is now tattooed forever on my leg! Love this book so much that this book I give to all new mother's!!  Thank you so much Robert Munsch!

B003O86FMW|4.0|This series made me think of George Orwell's book where the government was watching you all the time. I believe that book was titled &#34;1984&#34;.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You can read a plot summary elsewhere so I won't go into it.  What you want to know is exactly *what* I liked about it, right? If you've ever read The Hunt for Red October and enjoyed the submarine thriller espionage setting you'll like this.  It's less technical, (something that was Clancy's weakness in that book) and adds a post-apocalyptic setting with some amazing psychological games built into the plot.  Silo or submarine.  In either location you're talking close quarters and the need to adapt the way you live. Hugh seems to have truly captured the essence of silo living. There's plenty to describe to see it in your mind's eye and he does it beautifully.  I wonder, does he already own a silo somewhere in the upstate New York, Maine, Arizona or Kansas?  Yep, they are for sale at [...]<br /><br />Anyhoo, this book has a terrific plot that's captivating. I might have done a little more emotional character development with the female lead but that's just me.  I'd like to see Juliette feeling more rather than being so practical, stoic, technically proficient and closed off.  Why is she estranged from her father?  There's more to it than what's written. Can a fan ask for more relationship and intense feelings for her in future stories?  I'm a rather slow reader but it wasn't hard to keep a good pace with this book to get it done before my SciFi/Fantasy book club in a week.  I'm going to push fellow members to buy this.  I cannot wait for the next book to come out...I think I'll put Hugh's other books on my reading list and hope to see him invited very soon to Norwescon in Seattle on a future Easter weekend.  I wouldn't miss seeing him speak in person.  Just buy this book, either Kindle or hard copy and have a great time.
B004LUS390|5.0|I ENJOY this app. I love to doodle and play around, real fun :) I would like there to be more explanation on how to use the different mediums...
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Works great on kindleHD Luv this game. Great graphics, ez to learn, very colorful, lots of fun! Also works great on regular Kindle fire
B004VMUS9G|5.0|ive been using this app for a year and it helped me get up early in the morning. LOVE THIS APP! its a must-get alarm app.
B0055PSKE8|5.0|I have bought this app on 3 different OS's I find it invaluable as I am spelling challenged so the ability to speak  a word and the dictionary look it up is wonderful. I also like being able to find new and usual words to use like Lagniappe, Guilloche, and Callipygian. It really makes people stop and wonder.
B004XQYBA2|3.0|It just ok nothing to be proud of. It does do if you have nothing to do and this is the only thing to y
B0026S93C0|2.0|The two big scenes...\\"the splash\\" and \\"the audition\\" just didn't come off. Too bad. And it was very hard to understand.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Loved it, really pulled me in especially when it got to the twist, just couldn't put it down.  My other book club members were not so enthusiastic, but I would put it up pretty high on books I have enjoyed reading - can't wait to read more, I'm that into it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I'm close to finishing The Way of Kings, and I have really enjoyed it. It is like no other Fantasy book I've read. The concepts and ideas are new and interesting. I still don't understand everything that is going on in the book, but I think that's a good thing for the 1st book in a 10 book project. I look forward to the next book. Keep up the good work!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|find it hard to use, maybe I'm doing it wrong. There are no real instructions. I've found if there are instructions , please advise.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|Download constantly fails, even when it reaches 100%, then it will sporadically revert back to 0%. This is the mark of lazy programmers that don't bother putting in a checking system to keep track of the size of the ongoing download. 1 Star because they got an additional $1.99  from me for nothing and no way for me to easily contact them to get it back. Waste of time and money.<br /><br />Also, for company with several pinball apps (including a major license such as Star Wars), you would expect a better physics model. The pinball zips around with no gravity or resistance offering poor realism and lack of finesse.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Couldn't stop reading... had to know what happened next... love the twist at the end of the book... time for book 3
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Have enjoyed every episode. The characters are so interesting and I like how each character has his/her own story.  I think it's one of the best shows that has come out on television for a long time.
B00A757EFW|3.0|The  control is a challenge. There is not a bonus pac man at 25,000 pts. Have not gone to 50,000 to see if there is one. It takes some of the desire to continue without the reward for the higher score.But it less free. I would definitely play for one equal to the original.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Kerr continues to engage and fascinate with the Bernie Gunther series. He and Charles McCarry (Zoo Station, et. al.) transport the reader to a younger world, and the dark corners of that black vacuum that occupies the hearts of evil men, and seemingly will continue to do so forever. Simply excellent.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not a total loss obviously. I won't say much because I hate spoilers but in a few ways I did not like the end of the book even though Gale ended up being right, I don't like the last few major players closer to Katniss who died...READ THE BOOK
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It has both an alarm and sleep timer, both of which I was looking for. It works great and has plenty of options.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was my first experience with a Baldacci book.  I missed the character development from the series.  Several very interesting twists to the plot.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A decent story about a boy living on the sea with animals ... until you reach the end and you question everything you just read!
B004NELBPC|2.0|Latest update renders most stories in teeny-tiny typeface, with no way to enlarge it to a readable size. HuffPo's app has always blown, but this is just ridiculous.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|Excellent album with a ton of my favorite Floyd sons...takes me back to the 80s when I was listening to them more often.
B005LAIIGC|4.0|My kids enjoy it fine.  I think its ok, but it takes a bit too long to get to the story line in the begining.
B0045JEPXU|3.0|This is an OK album...only one I have from Pit...probably try to grab another and see if one is better than this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Pretty gory but still very enjoyable. I got hooked on it while I was up late at night nursing my baby =)
B000256TD0|5.0|FANTASTIC.  Exactly what I wanted!  This looks great on my desk at work, and my cube-mate actually asked if I would put it on the cubicle wall so we can share it.<br /><br />Only 2 Cons:<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the Mr. Fusion attachment comes unassembled and you have to \\"plug\\" it in...and afterward it is a bit loose.<br />The license plate says \\"OUTATIME\\" instead of having the more accurate reflective barcode, but it's more iconic this way.
0062068423|3.0|I'm not a regular crime/mystery reader and came upon Nesbo upon recommendation after loving the Stieg Larsson trilogy.  I started off enjoying this book and was even able to suspend my judgment after some huge leaps of faith in the plot.  Harry Hole is an interesting character but some of his mannerisms are forced and unbelievable:  trash in the office, driving old car that won't start, yelling out directives every 2 minutes, etc.  I was able to continue on, but then it went on forever with too many time shifts (for me).  And then the Norwegian names are very similar and after a while they just blend until it's like \\"Ok, whatever, I'm not going to go look back - let's just get on with it.\\"  Sooo, I wanted to like it but no dice for me.  But still love the way the Scandinavians offer coffee.
0811821846|5.0|Let's be honest...there are better recipes out there if you're talking just food-wise.<br /><br />But that's not the point, is it?  This is a collection of fun photos (taken with the original-release action figures) and creative recipe names like &#34;Yoda Soda&#34; &#34;Boba Fett-uccine&#34; &#34;Princess Leia Danish Dos&#34; &#34;Jabba Jiggle&#34; and of course, &#34;Wookie Cookies&#34;.  If you have a huge nerd in your life, they'll love this!  And kids will too!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|NOW HERE IS THE BEST MOVIE I THINK MADE FOR THE CHILD IN ALL OF US, IT IS A MUST SEE, PLEASE DO NOT MISS IT, YOU WILL ENJOY IT GUARANTEED..<br /><br />JAN H.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|The consistent bouncing around of the narrator was annoying. This is supposed to be the grand climax of a massive story and the side stories like Talamanes were boring. I skipped though them. Obviously after having read the first twelve books, you have to read this one. However, if this was a stand alone book, it would be one of the worst I have ever read. The ending is a total let down as well.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I can't figure out how to change the time.  When I clicked on my location, it didn't update to that time zone, but stayed in my home time zone.  I'm sure it's just me but I couldn't figure it out so I'm removing it and getting another clock app for my Kindle.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book takes the reader through the experiences of six North Korean citizens who found a means of escape. Having endured a lack of food, medical care, and luxuries that we take for granted, they were also made to believe that they were fortunate to live in a proud and powerful country. The escapees are astonished when they dicover life outside the boundaries to be plentiful. The adjustment to reality is not easy.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Used to help student with LD to be able to read and comprehend.  Great use, and it held her attention.
1600242405|5.0|This is a must if you are a Stones/Keith Richards fan. You couldn't make this kind of stuff up. Nobody would believe it.
B004OC07F8|5.0|I wish I would run my business using blue ocean strategy someday.<br /><br />It is very visible and simple.<br /><br />highly recommend!!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|This is a great movie. I highly recommend it to everyone. If you haven't seen it, it is a must see.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|As I say with all my reviews I should not have to justify why I gave something a thumbs up or a thumbs down.<br />Mandatory comments is so prehistoric.<br />If I like, I like. If not, I don't.<br />Period.<br />Tell Mt Amazon this, please.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This moving was very touching.  It embodies all that surfing represents. It is a true tear jerker. Can't say enough.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|It is a very sweet friendship between a little boy and a litlle fish, who will be in an adventurous life.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Best tv show ever!! ❤❤ I suggest watching it, its amazing! But start with season 1!! Or u might be a little confused
B005IQZB14|5.0|Found this book to be funny and real. Fast read that as a backpacker I found very inspiring to get back on the trail.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I love this remaster, the original was awesome but this sounds even better. I would highly recommend this to anyone considering its purchase, you won't be sorry.
1476734941|5.0|This book was straight forward, with both reports from the author's and other individual's results. I was impressed with the scientific information including lab values attained with use of this method. My results are 9 lbs in first month and feeling great.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Hey  - it's not Citizen Kane but it is an entertaining flick with some top notch vocal performances. Not as cloying as Glee (thankfully) just some mindless fun.  A fresh take on a world few have seen before (competitive collegiate acapella?!!)  Enjoyable for kids and adults.  Some language and situations that aren't appropriate for little ones but most of that flies by so fast they won't catch the adult context.  Musical numbers a must see - truly impressive.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  And since it is based on a true story, it made it all the more relevant.  Incredible story of survival!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am not a big fan of puzzle game but this one was fun. The only down side was it's a little short besides that I liked the it
B008M0UTRO|5.0|I had read some people have had audio problems with their copies of this movie, so when I received my copy I plugged it in right away to test it. The audio works fine, as well as the subtitles. The only problem I encountered was the DVD would not let me skip to the menu at all - not even with the skip keys. So you have to sit through/play through the previews in order to get to the menu. Which is just mildly annoying because once you play through them once the menu button works just fine.<br />So all in all, i'm very happy with my copy and the movie is great too.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This was a requested by my granddaughter. Did not know if I could find it. Glad I could find it.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I sooo relate to the mom in this movie, we are a lot a like in our ways! My children would so relate to Andy!
B008602KQI|5.0|I cant wait until the next one in the series. good action movie but would not let any little kids watch it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love love love this CD. I'm going to use some of the songs as wedding music. I'm very excited!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|When I retire if I could find a retirement home like this one in exotic India with this group of fabulous people,I would be happy for the rest of my life.<br />What a wonderful idea for a movie and the cast is fabulous. These people all seem like people you know and you laugh and cry with them. Not just a film for older people, a film for young people as well to see the young Indian couple going through what so many young people do world wide is charming.<br />The exotic locale is fabulous and my only problem with the film is the ending. I think the wrong person died....it should've been the witchy wife!!!!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I love this CD. I'm going to use some of these songs as my wedding ceremony music. Plus I like listening after I've had a bad day.
B0026O4JKA|5.0|I found an original copy of Pink Floyd's Ummagumma on vinyl at an old consignment shop, it had a weathered and worn out cover, and the vinyl was in ok condition, but they wanted $50.00 for it. I've loved Pink Floyd for as long as I can remember, so it pained me to put it down and walk away. Then next day I started looking for it online. I found it on here, and immediately bought it when I saw the price. When I got it a few days later, I was more than surprised when I saw the condition it was in. The cover was almost pristine, and the vinyl looked and sounded as if it had only been played a handful of times. I will definitely be buying more vinyl from these guys in the future.
B009NY43NY|4.0|In my opinion, I enjoyed the ending.  Not everyone can get the ending they wanted.  Definitely felt the book wrapped things up.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|That was a great black and white movie.I really enjoyed watching it.pls.n on buying it soon from you guy at Amazon.com
B003274QH6|5.0|Sopranos.<br />The Wire.<br />Breaking Bad.<br /><br />Unequivocally one of the best shows EVER on television.  Rivals that of anything on HBO or any other network.  You would be a fool not to watch this show.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Silver Linings Playbook started off well showcasing the troubles of a bipolar personality, but then rushed into a perfect Hollywood ending, without much development of how it arrived there.You have to suspend belief that a person struggling to get a grip on reality can suddenly figure everything out and put a plan in place to make it all work out in the end. Aside from that, it was well acted and enjoyable to watch. Wouldn't it be nice if all our problems were solved by a lovely lady that sticks with us through the worst times for no apparent reason?
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I loved reading this book after seeing the movie.  I had heard that there was some disparity between the two, and I have to say I like both the book and the movie.  I saw the movie as the main character, Pat,  as being manic/depressive, but in the book, Pat seems to be on the autism spectrum.  Either way, a found all the characters fascinating.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|This a very typical move by this director. Very over the top, however, on target for the time period. Great!
B00COGY2P2|3.0|The Jack Reacher character in this movie bears little resemblance to the character depicted in the book. If this were a true character and this a true scenario - nothing in the movie would equal the steps, tactics, and fundamental processes from real life - in that aspect, totally disappointing. But accepting that it is just a Hollywood action movie, there are a few good laughs and it moves at a good pace with acceptable acting and the story has a fine, if predictable, outcome.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|This is a great app that let's you customize your time preferences the way you want it. I would recommend this app to anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyed the story line and the surprising ending. As always, the characters become very realistic and hard to forget.  Subsequently saw the movie, but enjoyed the book much better.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|still playing with this but i'm impressed the all the options.i'm looking forward to all the things i'll be able to do with my pics.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is a nice cover. It is also easy to use, and offers many viewing positions. Seems solid and like a quality product for the good price.
B000W4D94I|5.0|I loved Twister. I loved the special effects used in the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in disaster movies. Keep up the great work.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Watched this one with my grandson.......like 14 times!  As always Ice Age is quality entertainment with great humor. Never boring.
072325804X|5.0|This is a great book. It is a beautiful book. Every parent and grandparent should have this book and read it to their kids.
B0055S348W|2.0|Only works with its generic driver for my Brother HL-2270DW printer.<br />Works minimally with my Canon Pixma MX850 printer.<br />Duplex printing not available although it's natively supported on both printers. This app still requires considerable driver and printer features development. I only purchased it due to Amazon's sale price and it shall only be utilized as a reserved backup print alternative for my device. Brother's own \\"iPrint & Scan\\" app is far superior and several competent free cloud print apps are also available on Google's Play Store. The developer should focus more on direct print support instead of attempting to exploit users with their subscription \\"remote\\" print alternative, else lower the app's price considerably. >:-(
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This promises to be an incredible sci-fi hit; the storyline, the premise, the characters, are all riveting right out of the gate. What do you do when you're an orphan and you find out, you have a sister? But not just a sister, a twin sister? And the moment you meet her, she throws herself in front of a train?<br /><br />This is our introduction to Orphan Black. And it doesn't stop there. Sarah Manning, raised in a British orphanage, is a street- smart hustler and after the shock of witnessing the suicide, steals the &#34;sister's&#34; purse & house keys and investigates-  only to find documents showing more girls who look exactly like her, all born within days of her own birthday. Deciding to impersonate the dead girl (Beth Childs) and clean out her bank account, she's stunned to find out Beth was a cop. A cop under suspension for shooting a civilian. She's further stunned when she's approached by Katja- a German girl who also looks exactly like her (except for pink dyed hair). Katja, thinking this is Beth, tells her they're all in danger- and then she is shot through the head in Sarah's car. But Sarah's rollercoaster doesn't end there.<br /><br />Why did Beth shoot this civilian? How long can Sarah impersonate her? How many clones are there? Who is the original? Who created them?  Why are they being killed off?<br /><br />It's all pulled together by the amazing young actress, Tatiana Maslany, who so far has played 6 distinct separate parts, flawlessly. Its a heavy lift for one actor, and she clearly has the Herculean strength to pull it off.<br /><br />It should be a great ride!
B009R659L8|4.0|The book held my attention; could not wait to get back to it when I had to put it down.  Did not see the ending coming!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|its a game. i like it, keeps me busy while im waiting during an appointment or in the airport so i cant complain.
B003G7164S|5.0|great service fantastic album and sounds superb have wanted this for ages worth the wait and the right site very pleased
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I thought this would sync with my google calendar but it did. After trying it for  a few minutes I just deleted it
B000SEFNMS|5.0|If you have ever thought you wanted to take off and live alone, on the road, or in the wilderness, this is a great book to read.
B00932A4XE|4.0|It was fun watching all the couple running around trying to get it figured it out. And then the baby come.
B009GED3HS|4.0|This show is very funny.  Although I personally would not recommend it for children, as it has a lot of adult themes and situations.
193700788X|1.0|I had fortunately stopped reading these books by the time the 10th rolled around. I will admit to having read this book out of morbid curiosity,and not as a fan anticipating it, but I am surprised at the lengths the author went to alienate her fan base with this. Besides the controversial choice at the end, about 70 to 80% of the main characters' personalities have been twisted beyond recognition, exaggerating all their negative attributes and pretty much killing any development they made throughout the series.<br /><br />It's been abundantly clear for the last couple of years that the SVM books were a tired franchise. The plots were always more contrived and convoluted and - for a so-called mystery series - completely centered in the love lives of the characters. By the time I stopped, a book could easily pass for a Mexican soap, this is not a problem to me as I mostly read because I liked the cast of characters, but when in interviews I kept reading that the author said the important thing in the books were the mysteries well, I sensed we were having a disconnect. In all honesty, the only mystery left in series to me was why the author chose to continue it at all. I am glad that I stopped when I did, and that a friend graciously lent me this book before throwing it out so I didn't have to shell out more cash for it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watch this on Amazon because I do not have cable.  Beware...once you start watching, you will be hooked!  ....
B00A77II0U|4.0|Super fun, great story, great graphics great everything.  First game from this company I tried, wad not disappointed. Perfect level of difficulty.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|We take turns building and caring for our reef.  Good clean family fun.  Only trouble is deciding which colors are the best.
B009R659L8|3.0|I usuallly love her books but this was not very well written and too contrived. It read as though Danielle Steel had written it - and she rarely writes a really good book.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I'm not a fan of competition, so having an Angry Birds game that should be played with friends doesn't interest me much.  Just to play you have to compete, so I don't play.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Love it! This is the last season, wondering how it all will end. Must watch from the show from the beginning!!
0061808121|5.0|I have many many books on CD but To Kill A Mockingbird will always be my favorite. The CD version lets me &#34;read&#34; when I am doing my exercise routines .
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I didn't think I would like this show, not into the 'zombie thing' but each episode gets better and better. Great storyline and very interesting to see how the characters evolve. Lots of surprises, and you never know who will make it. Recommended to start from season one and watch through.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|KI love to ride my horse round and entering tornaments. The only thing i dont like is how you cant change its name from Beauty!
B00ALCBU4M|3.0|Overall a good movie. I am only disappointed that the German tanks looks like Russian tank with a modified turret !!!
B00B99KJR0|3.0|When this game comes up with &#34;brick walls it's just too hard and frustrating. It's quite annoying. I enjoyed playing the other levels though.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|If you liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is even better since we get to see how things got started in the beginning. I love the movie and can't for the next one to come out. As for the extras .... fantastic !!!
B009MYARIK|5.0|I could not wait until this book came out.  It seemed like forever!  It was true Sophie Kinsella style,  Funny,  quirky,  sad,  hilarious,  heart warming all coming together for a fantastic read. I wanted to like Ben so I was  enthralled to see how she would write the twist that would change everything!  Her characters and their relationships with one another are always fantastic.  Now we wait............again....<br />for a new release..........sigh.........
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  One of the best books I have read on the topic of attracting what you want.  A very practical, lighthearted, but effective approach to a subject that can get complicated at times or clouded in mystery.  The experiments are excellent.  They allow the reader to take an active role in determining the accuracy of what she is writing about.  You not only read, you &#34;do&#34;.  I have read many works on the principles discused but the author does an amazing job of keeping things simple and putting things into a perspective I can really grasp on an &#34;everyday&#34; level.  Great book!
B003XDVVNQ|1.0|Requested size 11US, I recived size 6 US in the plastic bag of 11 US!!!!!!! For that i lost it..
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I am not even finished with this book yet and if I didn't have to go to work, I wouldn't put it down. Ms. Picoult has astounded me over and over with her books - I can't believe I hadn't discovered her sooner.  Her characters draw you in and it feels like you know them personally.  She also presents both sides, if not more, to the issues and that makes you think.  I recommend this book for everyone who is open-minded and even those who aren't.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Browse local storage, FTP, LAN, and cloud locations with look and feel of thumbnails, folder icons or by name. Works great and  easy to use on my Moto Razr M. Really like the left and right swipe to switch to a different interface/place. Built in file editor/viewer and music player are an unexpected bonus.
B00288KNJU|4.0|Definitely worth a watch. Like all Tim Burton movies, this one plays well with your imagination. I like putting on the 3d when I'm under the influence :D
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I bought this CD, because I used to own it...and I wanted to own it again! CD came on time & in good shape, thanks!
B005URRCUY|5.0|I really like this album because of the fact that none of the songs have fillers which gives the album a high playablity level. Songs like Little Black Submarines, Gold on the Ceiling, and Lonely Boy make this album really shine and none of the rest of the songs really subtract but only add more quality. Sure the album is more pop-ish than Brothers or any of the rest of their albums does that mean this album is a terrible album? Not one bit. In a world of bubblegum prissy pop stars. It's really amazing to see an album that I could play around without really feeling guilty and yes you can dance to these songs or bob your head or do whatever to it. It's a really good album period. No matter if the reviews say its good or bad. Just take my word for it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bought this for my 2 sons (age 8 & 9), needless to say they LOVE it! Package came in great shape, and on time...Thanks!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|The movie was okay but not what I thought it would be.  The acting was excellent but wasn't crazy about the story.
B002RAREAK|5.0|Package came on time and in good shape, thanks! I had no major reason to order this CD but I wanted to keep up with my Usher CD collection...I am happy I got it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Although this is classified as young adult fiction, it also draws in adult readers.  Characters are well developed and interesting.  The plot can be a little predictable, but hold readers' attention.  I found this to be suspenseful and entertaining.
B005LAII62|5.0|I bought this for my 2 sons (age 8 & 9), needless to say they LOVE it! Package came in great shape, and on time...Thanks!
B00BSWMITK|5.0|As an owner of all Joe's albums, I can say that I think this is some of his best work since (and sometimes reminiscent of) the 90's.  2000 to 2010 had a number of good albums, but I still find myself cycling through 'The Extremist' (1992), 'Time Machine' (1993), 'Joe Satriani' (1995), & Crystal Planet (1998) more than all the others.  And if you REALLY liked Satch's albums in the 90's, I think you're going to be very please with 'Unforgettable Momentum'.<br /><br />Upon first listening I'd give it 4-1/2 stars for just overall musicianship and musical quality.  But having listened through it multiple times now since it's recent release, I think it has already grown into a 5-star album for me.  One persistent criticism of Joe (especially for his more recent albums) is that it's all brilliant technique but somewhat lacking in the solid melody department.  I can see why a critic might say that about 'Professor Satchafunkilus' (2008) or 'Black Swans' (2010).  But I think 'Unstoppable' will prove different, once you have a chance to really soak it all in!  This album just has great rock melodies from start to finish -- I don't think there's a weak track on the entire album.  Some have already complained about his continued tinkering with keyboards, but even when present in this album I feel like it works as non-intrusive background to his guitar playing.  The simple melodies have lots of intricate layers that you'll start to pick up on as you listen to it more and more.<br /><br />All and all, a great all-around album. Glad to see Joe is still pumping out great music for us to enjoy.
B00466HN6S|5.0|DVD came on time, and in good shape...Just wasn't expecting that I would get the DVD without the actual case :(
B0049J0DC8|5.0|I have been wanting to see this great movie again for a long time.  Thanks Amazon for having it available.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Great movie, Cruise is great, I probably don't give him enough credit. {MI2 put me off Cruise movies)<br /><br />Best part, I have a new book series to read.
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|Love it! This is now my favorite movie!!!! Finally, a movie that followed the book more so than any other book and movie I have seen. :)
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Jennifer Lawrence is great but this is one of the most horrible movies ever.<br /><br />I hate insufferable white boy protagonists who are completely unbelievable because they have stupid shallow characterization.<br />I will never see any movie Bradley Cooper is in.  He is everything wrong with this country.  The sense of entitlement, the lack of personality, an \\"i'm so cute\\" affect.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is a great actor however.  She is completely different in every movie she has been in.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Split second was a great read.  The characters are easy to relate to.  Excellent.adventure .  I didn't want to put it down.in
B000FC0O7M|4.0|Some very interesting facts about missions that almost went wrong as well as a first-hand account of the amazing rescue of the Apollo 13 astronauts from a man who was there from the first Mercury flights through the last landing on the moon.  The book gets a little wonky at times (the author, Gene Kranz, has a background in test piloting and engineering), but the details about how control of the missions was established underscore the incredible achievement that the American space program was.  People who who yawned when Barack Obama essentially canceled the space program will get a feel for a different America; a country of true hope and promise that delivered the single most amazing feat of technology the world has known and the importance of leader of vision rather than division in making it happen.
B0093LFENA|3.0|The CD is fine but the case looked worn, and was cracked all over. Not bad considering the price but I'd spend more and get a better quality one.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is one of the most well written books I have ever read. The twist and turns, and how it captivates you to want more. To be able to enjoy the mystery of the circus is what I wish could be a reality. An excellent read!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Interesting plots. Subtle tie-ins to Doyle's original stories. Good acting. Well paced action that does not slow down. I like the way Sherlock adapts to new technology to help solve cases, especially cell phones.
B002NN5F7A|4.0|Must-see. Pacino at his finest, as well as the whole cast, Spacey is the perfect dick in the office you wish only bad things to happen to.<br />Pay attention-this is a dialogue heavy film and u need to pay attention!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love the series but HBO plays late for obvious reasons.  Story line is great and actors are awesome.  Hope to get season 3 when it comes out
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It was a good movie. I don't know if it was five dollars worthy, but, enjoyable at least. A little like \\"Reign over me\\".
B00005B1W7|5.0|This is one mini-series that I really enjoyed from the &#34;age of mini-series&#34;.  There was quite a bit of history involved, plus the court room drama was fabulous.  I really love this DVD/
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Great Men in Black movie,keep up the good work.Very good ending, I liked the 1969 part of movie.best movie this year.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was boring in most parts and it was mostly drama and not brutal like the old books so I gave it 3 stars and her mental problems got extremely annoying
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Don't like all the online game they keep pushing on you.<br />Enjoy playing the game myself.<br />Sounds can get on your nerves.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Got this one at a  great price, which made it soo much better ;)<br /><br />All around if your a fan, the box art and packaging is great. Not filled with booklets and junk, just a nice book style Bluray holder with great artwork. Movies are fantastic quality and offer the extended and theatrical versions when available.
B0012HRJEA|4.0|This version is entertaining for the modern elements incorporated into a classic story. I still think the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli version is the best.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three. Would recommend to anyone with a curiousity about different kinds of sex. Ifelt the story could go on.<br />Shows that love can prevail and horrible backgrounds can be overcome. Recommend to anyone who loves unconditionally
B001XV3LSS|5.0|This remains one of my favorite movies of the last 25 years for its suspense, but mostly because of the character Jodi Foster plays and the premise of searching for &#34;intelligent life out there.&#34; Everything works in this film building the characters and suspense to a climax that is interesting and satisfying.  I love the hopelessly driven scientist Foster plays, pursuing her vision in a quest that everyone tells her is pointless and the suspense that relentlessly builds as her vision comes true and then takes on a life of its own well beyond her control. Even the unfulfilled romance with Matthew McConaughey is fascinating with surprising chemistry between the actors and filled with the seductive philosophical conundrum of faith vs fact fueling the magnetic attraction and separation of the lovers. I appreciate the vision and ambition of this movie every time I see it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved all three. Nothing I disliked. It was a new experience into alternative sex . The unwinding story of Christian was brilliant
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|A great story of a great man and the sufferings of the Jews during World War II.  My favorite movie of all times.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|If ur going to play online be warned i cant play anymore becouse i try to get online and it just stops if u know how to help me plz do
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I never watched this series on TV but had heard it was a good show. Any show that has made five seasons and won awards must be at least worth a look, right? I heard it was available through Amazon Prime so I figured I would give it a try. By the end of the second episode I was hooked! I am currently halfway through season two and enjoy every minute of it! I am sure I will use this summer to work my way through the series so when it returns this fall I will be awaiting the premiere with everyone else.
B009X01D9U|1.0|This case is incompatible with a zag protective cover.  It will leave unremovable black marks all over the zag cover.  By the time it gets bad enough that you can't see your kindle screen anymore you will have to pay the Amazon $11 restocking fee.  Otherwise I love the features of this case.
B007REV4YI|5.0|As a Bond fan, this has been the best Bond movie yet.  Sure Connery did a great job given the technology, script writing and so forth back then.  But Daniel Craig is today's Bond and Skyfall brings the edginess that movie-goers want (I was not a fan of Roger Moore's campy portrayal of the character).  Ticket sales for this movie proves the point.  What I like about Craig's portrayal is while in real life James Bond would never be accepted by such an agency (they don't much go for the 'lone wolf' types), Craig makes the character more believable mostly because he's rather plain looking and not as strikingly handsome as Ian Fleming depicted.  And in the Intelligence community, &#34;plain&#34; is good.  Moreover, what I enjoy most about Craig's work is that he conveys a world of emotions with his facial expressions and gestures - watch Casino Royale again after the fight scene when he's in the restroom trying to stop the bleeding.  Craig's facial twitches and gestures makes one feel the pain he is suffering.  But I digress...<br /><br />What I like about this set aside from the behind the scene extras is the digital copy that I can play on my computer.  This way the Blu-ray stays home and the digital copy travels with me for enjoyment on the road.  The two disc and the price that Amazon offers is a great value for any Bond fan.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|it was a well-written movie and I enjoyed the story that is told it held my interest throughout the movie. It had excitement, adventure and heartfelt moments
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, mostly because I enjoy reading non-fiction books about the Navy SEALs.  I'm often torn with books like this because I have friends who are retired SEALs who are old-school and prefer the &#34;community&#34; to remain quiet.  That said, this book is well written and seems accurate enough (one must understand that this account is written from the author perspective thus it will be slanted in his favor).  I purchased this book because I was taking a long road trip and thought it would help pass the time.  I was not disappointed.  I purchased it for my Kindle and also purchased the professional narration so I listened to the story as I drove.  It made for a quick 11 hour trip.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app so much!!!<br />It's an app if you are bored or you feel down<br />And it's appropriate for all ages
B000002TQV|5.0|This album marks Radiohead's transition from Nirvana-lite to, well, Radiohead.  There's still the three chord guitar anthems, but their built up into dense, multi layered epics.  Thom Yorke's lyrics transition from personal angst into cryptic and haunting melancholia.  \\"Creep\\" made Radiohead superstars, but this album is where Radiohead really begins.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, due to the lyrical content of the album, Yorke was thought of as the likely candidate to be the next rock and roll martyr, rather than Kurt Cobain.
B000N5F6OW|5.0|I grew up watching John Wayne films, and this was my all time favorite. It is great for the fact it is a clean movie, no nudity, swearing, or excessive amounts of blood. I recommend anyone to watch this.
B005LAIH5O|4.0|It was good entertainment for an evening. I didn't get mad and want my couple of hours back but I wasn't blown away either. I love the actors in it and it had some action scenes so that's why I gave it 4 stars.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Just too good...love playing it...just go nd get this app. Its good for any age group...its even a good eye exercise.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Violin? Check<br />Dubstep? Check<br />Awesomeness? Check<br />Lindsey Stirling takes the unique combination of violin and dubstep and blends them together into art. The melody passes between the violin and the electronic beat like a skateboarder in a half-pipe, each pass building and shaping the music into a seamless whole.<br />This has been great to have on while studying. The beat distracts the part of my brain that would get distracted by... everything.... helping me focus on studying.<br />My only complaint is that the album is only 45 minutes long, I've already played through the album 24 times in one week. (such is Finals for you)<br />Update: After a week and a half of finals and having this on repeat, I played through it about 55 times. =)
6305252572|5.0|This movie and its sequel (Another 48 Hours) are very good movies. The movies are filled with action a comedy blend that makes them delightful to watch.
B006LSZECO|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THOSE &#34;NEVER PUT DOWN&#34; BOOKS.  SUCH A GOOD READ AND SO MUCH FUN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ONE AND LOOK FORWARD TO OTHER FLYNN BOOKS.
B007P4OTHO|5.0|What can I say? It's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust. This album is a classic. It was well packaged and pressed on heavy grain vinyl. A must have album for my taste.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I don't play farm games but I love this game!  I've been addicted since I started. Just one thing though: why is Rainbow Dash an insane amount of gems?
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I like it but i loved the first trilogy Jackson put out....I hope that for a next sequel they fo lil bit more
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Sanderson did a great job wrapping up the story.  You could tell there was a lot more story that could have supported the ending.  So the ending was less than what it could be.  I was glad to have a finish though.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is a very well acted, filmed and written series.  There is a twist and a turn with every new episode.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I have managed multiple businesses at one time and it is difficult to become highly successful when you are trying to do too many things at one time.  Now, I have &#34;simplified&#34; my life and this book and the advice has really brought focus to what needs to be done to achieve results in the areas of my life that matter most.  Love it!
B008KY6RQO|5.0|It feels like the Swans nailed it with this one and I'm hoping someone can help me with another word besides 'epic'.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry is poetry in motion!  What a great game this is.  It is very addicting and great for all ages!
B0097AQEOK|3.0|I greatly enjoyed Joni Mitchell's Hits CD and thought there might be other cuts that did not become popular which would be of equal or better quality.  I was wrong.  Hits extracts the best of Joni Mitchell.  There are no gems buried in these 10 CDs.  Some cuts are OK, but those I never heard of were worth missing.  She has a great voice but her memorable oerve is, given the length of her career, rather thin.  A shame.
B00CE6E6B2|3.0|I don't like that you need energy to do anything.<br />It would be nice if there was no energy at all.
B006RBZV82|5.0|Awesome pic quality anf no issues in streaming like documentaries hope I can have a whole lot a collection to see from
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I watched this series every night after supper and could not have enjoyed it more. I would reccomend this to any lady that loves Brittish movies
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|A must read to understand modern day Israel, and how it grew from swamp/ desert to the powerful and thriving country it is today
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|Best high school comedy movie from the 80's, for those of us who lived it.  We can all relate as one of the characters.
B00BMT9SQA|3.0|It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. It takes a while to figure out the story line but by the end of it you figure it out and it has a good story line.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Two achingly lonely 12 year olds build an unlikely relationship that leads to a fierce loyalty to one another, a loyalty that is dramatically tested at the conclusion.  I can't think of another movie in this genre that focuses on the story, not on Hollywood-style thrills and chills.  Even the soundtrack music is quietly understated--and lovely.
B00932A4XE|3.0|Unless you've had children, this put me to sleep. I didn't find it that interesting but don't let my opinion deter you from watching.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I don't know.  Stopped reading it halfway through, then took it up again some weeks later.  It was gripping, hard to put down, AND hard to sleep afterwards!  But NOT Nat'l Book Award candidate!
B009AP2G26|5.0|While this season did have its ups and its downs, it has been a fantastic season. It almost brings it back to the star quality season 1 had. It makes me hopeful for seasons 5 and 6!
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|I don't understand why this film did so poorly. Not that it's particularly good, but neither is it that different from most of what's out there. As he did with \\"Oz, the Great and Powerful\\", writer David Lindsay-Abaire tries to compensate for his total inability to write believable characters with trite platitudes -- in this case, wanting people to believe in you. Believe in YOURSELF, for God's sake! Designed within an inch of its life, \\"Guardians\\" is watchable, but oh SO familiar! Hollywood has forgotten how to write fantasy. These days films scream \\"wonder\\" and \\"awe-inspiring\\", telling you what you ought to be feeling. This film never shuts up about the \\"wonder\\" of childhood, mouthed by adults who have forgotten what that is. As that old writer's maxim goes: \\"show, don't tell.\\" I guess Mr. Lindsay-Abaire was asleep that day!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|As usual, Ken Fallet did it agian. He made historical events come to life and clearly enfold the events dramatically.
B00BUCW54Q|2.0|I love the Reacher books and eagerly await new ones.  One of the hero's strongest features is intimidating size and bearing...a natural alpha dog....and Cruise, in however good shape, simply cannot deliver intimidation.  A lame sop to Hollywood and much diminished story relative to the books.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Found the writing that of a boycrazy 15 year-old girl  - juvenile and repetitious. Need six more words and can't think of any.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I put this on my Mini pad and it synced from my other Google calendar..  you can go from day to week to month to year in a flash. And it has a list that shows all your important dates
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Great for entire family.  Would watch it again and again.  Would make a great holiday gift idea. Kids enjoyed it.
0385349831|3.0|I really love Paulo Coelho.  He is an amazing writer and storyteller and I have read most all of his books.  That said, I felt like this particular book was not one of his best.  At first I was confused whether or not the \\"Manuscript found in Accra\\" was real.  I still don't know. It is not stated as a fact in the book.  I guess its not..... when I just couldn't figure that out, I started to read.<br /><br />I felt that immediately disappointed that this book reads just like the book \\"The Prophet\\" by Kahlil Gibran.  As I read further it kept reading like Gibran, which felt very familiar and weird.....  I mean it could be an extension of Gibran's book, because the format is exactly the same.  For instance each chapter starts with something like this: \\"And a woman who was getting on in years and had never found a husband said: \\"Love has always passed me by.\\"  Then the chapter starts with, \\"And he answered: In order to hear Love's words, you must allow Love to approach.\\"  This feels just like Gibran to me.<br /><br />All that said, there is beautiful Wisdom in here, as there is in all Coehlo's books but for some reason I just couldn't get past how much it read like something that has been done before.  And I kept asking myself, \\"Where is the story?\\"<br /><br />And yes, it is wonderfully written as all of Coehlo's books....  and .... but... I don't know.  I guess I was expecting more.  So buyer be aware that this book is not a \\"story\\" per se, but rather a self help sort of book with actually loads of love and wisdom, and certainly good advice and beauty.....  But don't expect a story, but rather small stories within a possibly real story...  that reads a lot like the book \\"The Prophet\\" by Gibran.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because I did like the material and it is well written.  It just didn't feel like an original creative work, which has always been the case when I read Coehlo.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|A dark and humorous war movie. WWII gets the QT treatment.  If you like Tarantino movies, you should like this.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Suspense and intrigue at it's best. Especially appropriate story line given our world today. Acting and action was terrific. Characters are compelling.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was simply amazing!! I hate to point this out but it's my first Stephen King book that I've read from beginning to end. Very entertaining and what better part of history to go back to.
1476734941|5.0|It is written well enough for me to understand the fasting diet concept.  Good illustrations to further promote the idea.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|The only thing I don't like is that it's over. Love the series, love the movie! The ending is sad for a number of reasons...watch to find out what makes it sad beyond it being over. I wish they'd round up the staff and bring the series back. They could even do flashback episodes!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Watching it because my daughter loved it and have to agree it was good...now I love Castle, too!  Have to watch Serenity next.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am not a history buff, but looked up several people and facts and the book does coincide nicely. When you get to the history side of things, seeing the events through established characters is more comprehensive to me (and more interesting). I have and am impressed with the writing versatility of Follett.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I really like how this Sherlock is so quirky & more human. I also like how Watson struggles to find herself and still able to keep Sherlock &#34;in-line&#34;. They also didn't do anything stupid like make this Sherlock as though he's trying to be the fictional one from Conan Doyle. They kept him original and separate with no reference to the author & his character.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have only recently started watching this show but I really like it, it's interesting and addictive...  It keeps you guessing what is next.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Even my teenagers get into the series. This is a fun series that doesn't dwell on the dramatic. We have more than enough of that with all the CSI, Law & Order series; which I like too but one needs to get away from being quite so serious.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|It is absolutely the worst way to enjoy a computer piano keyboard.  If it hadn't been a freebie, I'd be trying to get my money back.  ALSO, I cannot get it to DELETE DELETE DELETE.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved this book and am excited for the third installment.  Great characters with dark pasts and troubled histories, explosive love scenes and scorching suspense.  Just a great series all the way around.
B0083Z3O8Y|2.0|I really like Jane Austin's works, but this story was just terrible.  As a matter of fact, I quit reading it.  There is really no plot, just a bunch of words.  I really don't care about the lamb that was served for dinner, and there was page after page about this dumb dinner - let's get on with the story - oh yah, there is no story!  Sorry Jane, this is one to tuck away.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Couldn't put it down until the end.  Couldn't wait to find out how this turned out after reading the first two in the series
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|A MUST FOR ALL EAGLES FANS,  ONE OF THE BEST  MUSIC DVD's  I HAVE , EXCELLENT,  BUT THE ONE DVD FROM THE MID 1970's  I GIVE IT  5 STARS ***** GREAT
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The author did a fantastic job connecting the reader to its characters. I loved the concept of the language of flowers, and I am not a huge fan of flowers or gardening, but reading this book made me want to discover it more! This was an excellent book that I couldn't put down!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I lasted half an hour. Part of my dislike probably had to do with expectations. I expected to hear some good A Capella singing by grown up characters. Instead it was a silly college drama. It's possible that a story line and some good acting appeared after I turned it off but I doubt it.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Since I discovered this film at a rental store and liked it well enough to buy a copy, I had no idea how many viewers actively disliked it. [On Amazon, the number of \\"4 Star\\" reviews is virtually identical to the number of \\"1 Star\\" reviews!] After reading some of the more negative responses to the film, I think I realize better why I like it as much as I do. It is clearly not a typical modern \\"Raimi/Romero/ slasher/gore horror-fest, but a throwback to the classic thrillers that established an existential (albeit) supernatural menace...and then left us to enjoy the excitement (and terror) of imagining ourselves in the protagonists' position. Boris Karloff once complained in an interview that he disliked hearing his early films like FRANKENSTEIN and THE MUMMY referred to as \\"Horror Movies.\\" [He preferred the word \\"Terror.\\"] He pointed out (very politely) that any idiot can throw gruesome images on the screen and edit them in such a way as to make an audience scream and clutch each other. [It's the cinematic equivalent of startling a child by yelling \\"Boo!\\"] But it takes a certain amount of ingenuity to persuade an audience that they should be frightened of something that they know (intellectually) doesn't really exist. It takes a special talent to make intelligent people yield to a willing suspension of disbelief. If you like rapid-paced slasher films, you might want to give this film a pass. But if you like the supernatural stories of E.F. Benson or Arthur Machen, or films like Karloff's THE MUMMY, you should enjoy the ride.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read this book after hearing about the murder of the author, Chris Kyle. This is an excellent story about the experiences of one of Americas great warriors, a Navy Seal, and his service to our country. This is a must read for anyone interested military life and what it is like for the combat veteran.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Artsy interpretation of a classic... probably better for people who know the source material.  For newbies like us, it was a strange way to be introduced to the story.  Kind of like a super-modern opera production.... if you know and love the opera, you might appreciate a new and strange production, but your first time seeing that opera should probably not be so outlandish.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|What's to say, it's 'The Hobbit'. A little slow to start, but really enjoyed it, can't wait for the second one.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I read this book because I wanted to learn more about what the US was thinking around the time When Hitler came to power.<br /><br />There where some who actually did not see how dangerous Hitler was.<br /><br />It was interesting to see that FDR knew we had no choice to fight.  And the politics that went on.  90% of the Americans where saying &#34;Let Europe fight it's own wars.  We felt we had been suckered into WWI and did not want to make that mistake again.<br /><br />I was also amazed at Charles Lindbergh.  Early on Nazi leader Herman Goering invited him to Berlin to inspect his air force. He was given a award for his achievments in flying.  Lindbergh was a fool and he saw FAcism as the way to go.<br /><br />But then when I found out he had 6 illagetamit kids...by 3 different women, and gave a hate filled speech about Jews he really showed who he was.<br /><br />Yes...I recommend this book but if you are a Lindbergh fan, you may lose your love for him.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Because I felt it was worth 4 stars<br />It was a good action movie that's why I liked it<br />I recommend it to any action movie buffs
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Although it differs from the book, I really enjoyed this movie. I am looking forward to the sequel! I also recommend reading the trilogy!! Some people may not enjoy the movie as it is about &#34;kids killing kids&#34;. (I think I remember hearing something about that when it first came out)
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I am disappointed in this movie, it was really not at all like the book. A lot of things were changed and other things added that didn't even happen in the book. So if you have read the book, you will probably be disappointed in this movie.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My 5 1/2 year old son LOVES this movie.  It's very imaginative, sweet and funny.  I highly recommend this film.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|For fans only! This is the full combo version and most fans will want this series in blu-ray and digital, so if you are a fan - then buy.
B00480OHWK|5.0|When I was a Monitor on a Headstart School Bus I read this book to the little children on the Bus. They absolutely loved it and I had to read it to them everyday on the way home from school.
B00CBRAD2A|4.0|Ok, I didn't put a lot of expectation into choosing this movie, but after watching it, I was pleasantly surprised.<br />It was actually very good. Arnie's performance wasn't overdone, in the way of being too macho. He played his role as an aging ex L.A. cop looking for the quiet life as the sheriff of a small south-western border town, and has an unexpected run in with a Mexican drug cartel.<br />Good action, good humor and good entertainment.
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|Great movie. Exciting and definitely worth watching. Actors were wonderful. Would highly recommend it to others watch at any time,
B001KZG99A|5.0|I have no doubt that Robert Downey Jr will go onto that Walk Of Fame very soon.The Iron Man movies are excellent.Sherlock Holmes is awesome,but these Ironman movies are going to be classics.They picked the right actor for these and this first in a long line to come is amazing.If your into action packed hero movies this is one of the best yet. Downey puts a mixture of humour and wit into this character and he achieves making his character believable.Unlike some of the super hero movies,this one is believable.
1476733953|2.0|Absolutely nothing that anyone does in this book makes any sense. The author gets an extra star for an interesting premise but... wow, this was terrible. Why is it so important to IT that someone cleans? Build a robot or something. Why wouldn't they put any effort into building functional suits? People could go out and \\"clean\\" weekly and then come back and hose down. Why is it some huge secret conspiracy that there are other silos? Why does the fact that one person chose not to clean automatically mean \\"prepare for war\\". Just dumb.<br /><br />Obviously everyone has different tastes, so of course some people will love this book. But the number of 5 star reviews relative to the rest is really quite suspect considering the quality of this book.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Everyone should have this in their Christmas Collection, it is a must.  Everyone love's it.  You may also like the Marlo Thomas remake called It Happened One Christmas.  It is a great remake with a twist.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Very good film, especially for dyed-in-the-wool Hitchcock fans. For me, the real eye opener is Helen Mirren's portrayal of Alma Reville, Alfred's wife, the power behind the throne. Not bad, quite sentimental.
193700788X|1.0|I have had a few weeks to calm down over the HEA. I also managed to come across a free copy to read today.<br /><br />HEA and character assassinations aside: I am going to put as much effort into this review as CH obviously put into the book, which was one of the most lazy and sloppy things I've read in a while.<br /><br />Don't bother with it.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|We have every format of this movie.  The Blu-ray 3D version is great and my kids love watching it I my IPhone.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|too stupid and didn't stream well...a real bummer it could have been a great movie but just too dumb for words.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|We have used this movie for discussion starters in several groups. I rarely watch a movie twice; however, I wanted to watch this one again.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Great job! best book I've read in a long time! Great story, Movie stays true to the book. Good job.
B007HJ9LXE|4.0|I saw this in conjunction with an art exhibit of Frida's and Diego's work. it really made the exhibit more meaningful.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Fairly boring. had a few funny moments, but not worth the 4.99 I paid to rent it. This family is completely out of touch with reality and it was irritating to see how they chose to live their lives and spend their money. Nothing like a normal American family. More like a Californian family. Very sad little lives.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|My wife and I love all the books in this series (and this world). Though my wife prefers the books about Bean this is a great series as well. You can't go wrong with this book.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I've read this book so many times now, but each time it always makes me think differently.  There's always a new way of looking at each mini story. One of my favorite books, hands down.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|This is not the American FF3, but the Japanese FF3.  The American FF3 that I was expecting is actually FF6.  That being said, it is still an incredibly fun game that kept me entertained for a couple weeks.  I am not sure if it was worth the full price they are asking for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an awesome game I will always play it forever until I lose my IPhone and until I lose my kindle fire HD 8.9 until then I will always be happy. When I go to my sister's basketball game I bring my kindle or my IPhone and always play subways surfers and ever if you play it a bunch of times you will never get over it I won't I know that for sure. At night when I am supposed to go to bed I stay up all night playing subway surfers and when I wake up I am so tired I fell right back to sleep that's how tired I was and I am going to do that every week.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Nothing too deep, but a fun, happy read. Really enjoyed it. Laughed out loud a few times... A lot of fun.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book about love, redemption and family. I did not know anything about the author prior to reading the book but will look for more of her books in the future.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Just as good if not better than the first one!! Two thumbs up!!!!! Rent/buy it. You won't be disappointed. Seriously... No kidding
B004I744AS|5.0|i like the the ease of finding a word and all the other information  it gives you i could just read it for  that
B0095P29EG|3.0|This movie reminds me of an attempt for a thriller while on a tight budget.  Plot was pretty dull and while special effects were decent the opportunity was there to make it better.
1878424319|5.0|Amazing book that is truly a life changer! Everybody should look into reading this book. Quick and easy read, very inspiring
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Did not like the movie! The movie was making political statement instead of teaching history. Hollywood gets it wrong again.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|The game was rather boring, even my grand son was not interested in playing it.  Graphics and action totally lacking.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was able to watch seasons 1 & 2 free with Amazon Prime, but by the time I got through those, season 3 was available only by paying.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!<br /><br />This series will be a Classic!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pendergast has now taken his story to a potential end. Can the plot continue? I would hope that it can, I have thoroughly enjoyed this adventure and hope that there is another story to come.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book provides a great perspective on the recent US engagements(wars) from someone who laid his life on the line for his country.  All the talk about nation building, and standing up fledgling democracies doesn't mean much to someone who is taking enemy fire.  They just want to do their job, protect their fellow warriors, and get home with their honor in tact. Chris's voice and specifically his &#34;SEAL&#34; humor comes through in his account.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Enjoyed all the book, the sad parts, the frank and realistic scenes; and there were lots of humor scenes in this one.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie was awesome.  The actors and actresses played the roles great.  If you love history this is a must see movie.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Very nice free app. Very easy to use and love that it has the scientific calculator included in it. For anyone that uses a calculator, this is the app for them.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I haven't read the books yet, but I loved the movie. Will def read the books now. Loved the costumes and music in the movie.
B007WPM4P0|5.0|A touching drama.  I did read the book which is so true to the period.  Gave me a human insight into WWI.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Loved the interactive between Jennifer and Bradley... Great flick!!! Would watch it again and again. I think it is a must see!
B000W93CHC|5.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett and this is my favorite of all. The story is complex and consuming.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|After hearing what a blockbuster it was opening weekend and hearing a couple of comments from reviewers stating this was best of the 3, I gotta say I was very disappointed after seeing this last night.  Was it entertaining? - yeah sure. Did it have some good special effects? - yeah sure.  Did it have a coherent logical somewhat believable (for a comic book hero) storyline - NO!  This was a movie that was trying to be way too cute for my tastes.  One reviewer I listened to said this was a much more gritty version/story than the first two.  I don't know what they were watching, but it couldn't have been this attempt at a laughfest.  At least the humor in the first two was more balanced by the story and action whereas this one was throwing out one-liners one after another and only half of them were actually funny, the rest where obvious that someone was trying to hard.  While I realize this is a comic book hero, I prefer some semblance of reality to the plot/storyline.  Turning Madarin into a complete joke did not help.  They really lost me when the Guy Pearce character blew fire out of his mouth like some dragon.  Why not just have him bend over a blow it out his you know what since they were so obviously trying to get the most laughs out of this.  Then the whole thing with Pepper Pots supposedly perishing near the end (you knew she didn't) and then coming back to clobber Guy Pearce was a bridge too far. I hope this is not what we can expect from Disney now that they own Marvel.  If it is, it's gonna be the death of the franchise.
B007HV93CQ|5.0|I gave it 5 stars...need I say more? :)  Wonderful music to do anything by. Wonderful artist! Nobody better, for sure!
193700788X|2.0|From the beginning the book did not read like the rest of the series.  I had a feeling Sookie and Sam would end up together but the way she got them there was rushed.  It felt like CH just threw in all the characters to &#34;wrap&#34; up their story lines.  Disappointing way to end the series 😔
B003QZ5222|5.0|They might not be sate of the art re-masters, but all the Springsteen CD's sounded fine. The box and paper sleeves were really nice also. The best bargain I have gotten yet.
B009K72RRS|5.0|Clone Wars season 5 starts off with a bang, and never lets up. I could go into great depth, but there is no need. This is the show you are looking for...
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|So far it does not open PDF files on my tablet. Have never had issues on other devices. Hope to get it resolved.
B003DCPGNS|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  The interplay between Grant & Hepburn is magic. Excellent film even in today's world.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I really have a new insight into North Korea and the people's situation there. Well written and highly recommend it.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I like Amazon MP3 much more than Google Music or the stock Android music player.  It allows you to download songs from your cloud drive/player.  The only improvement need is to allow music uploads directly to the cloud drive/player.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|I really like the album. The quality of the sound is outstanding. The singers are some of the best singers of the generstion.
B000FC11A6|3.0|The story takes too long to develop and there is really no clear main character that you want to know better until the end.  I was left with a feeling that the author never really knew who he wanted to us to feel good about.  The shifts in generational histories were too abrupt and did not tie together well most of the time.  Overall a good story that could have been better...
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|My computer is old and I was only able to watch the movie on a 5x7 screen. But it was an excellent movie.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is a must-see documentary. It was Malik Bendjelloul's first film and it was gold! An amazing story and a beautiful film. The bonus features are a fantastic addition to the experience.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|I first learned about these guys on youtube and I was impressed by their talent. This album is fantastic. The songs are driving and upbeat in their rhythm. I would say they were inspired by Mumford and Sons. At any rate I bought this album mainly to support them and I wasn't disappointed. They have been integrated neatly into my playlist. You will do the same.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Peter Jackson sure has blown this opportunity. I cannot imagine to be so arrogant as to change something, so well loved, by so many, at a whim. From the Lord of the Rings first film, where he clearly was thinking more with his man parts than anything else (otherwise Liv Tyler would not have been in it so much), which caused us to miss the great story characters like Tom Bombadil and Goldberry...to the wholesale clobbering of the Hobbit where the classic scenes like Troll's turning to stone, or the Giants having a stone battle (not stone giants having a battle) or the names of the pony's...changed....why? Not for time (except to make one movie into three), not for story...clearly the popularity of the books shows we all loved the story as it was...not to fix plot errors of the original...because he's created so many they really cannot be fixed. So as of now, I promise, I will remake the films. I've wanted to make them since I was six and read the books to my ailing mother as she lie sick, in bed for months.<br />So help me to raise the money...if each person gave a dollar, I'd have enough to undo the atrocity which is this film.

B007CEWR62|5.0|With the notable exception of &#34;Inside I'm Singing&#34; which was a horrible mess, Every Secret Garden album is on my writing playlist. They have a full, beautiful sound. The best of New Age music in my opinion. If they ever make films of my books, I would love to see these guys write the soundtrack.
B008602KQI|5.0|love Jennifer! she is a great actress! also love the plot, at least something new. really tired of the remakes.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|My only complaint is that it is only six songs. I watched this guys win the sing-off and I thought they were definitely the best group in the history of the show. They have been smart with their promotion and Youtube videos and I recommend them to everyone. Acapella music is rarely breaking new ground but these guys with only five members do more than most of those large groups.<br /><br />This particular recording is studio produced so even though it is all their voices, there are a few instances where you can tell the guy in the booth has manipulated their voices. Still, the intrusion is minimal and well done. This is a must listen.<br /><br />Now I want a full album.
1592332803|5.0|I received this book as a gift and absolutely love it!! I have made many delicious treats and wowed many with them.  My fav response from anyone who eats my creations is, \\"THESE are vegan??\\" ha ha like since it's vegan it shouldn't taste good.  My family and I made the transition to vegan back in 1995 but I still find things new and exciting in this cookbook.  Some of my personal favorites include, chocolate cake, brownies, lemon bars, pancakes, and the chocolate chip/nut cookies.  Delicious!!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I like the convenience of being able to listen to my amazon MP3 purchases from other devices, but I found that it takes a lot of memory to run and often times has to pause and buffer, even in good coverage areas. I mainly use it in my car on my android phone,
B000FBJFSC|5.0|You can feel the poverty,the survival instincts. sad, powerful, you feel the emotions rip out of the page and land in yourself.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just love this game. It's very addicting.  I'm only on one suit and I think you an spall four suits, which would be very difficult. I tried two suits and gave up after if of frustrated.  I'm very content with one suit.
0061122416|5.0|My ex boyfriend kept going on and on about this book until I eventually got a copy. Best book I've read in my life! It's such a simple and short read but so much weight in it's message. My best friend purchased a copy after I had her read it, then she purchased it for two other people. I loaned my copy to my Manager and he too is ordering a copy. MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|This is great like everything Corey has a hand in. some of the best he has done yet. and the entire album really paints a story
B0072X2O66|3.0|this is an okay album the drumming is fantastic, vocals leave a little for desire, but all in all, i respect the effort
B004RE29PO|5.0|This was my favorite movie of the series!!!!!!!!!! I watched this movie a 55'' LED and 7.2 with duel subwoofers WOWW!!!! I highly recommend this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007OASII|5.0|i am a lover of theatrical rock, been my passion lately.  If you like Savatage you will like these guys.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|I just wanted to contribute to a great man and his legacy. I love his story and every thing he stood for.
B0097K21YW|4.0|decent catapult. you are godzilla and burn burn bucks to upgrade your monster. fun to watch cities burn. weak pyhsics, but I would imagine upgrades are comjng with sudden infusion of free app of day cash. worth a spot on your phone but not perfect yet.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|We downloaded the app for our kid and suddendly charges appear in the billing statement and there is no way to undo... obviosly my kid doesnt read I consider as a robbery
B007IXWL2C|5.0|At first when I purchased the book, on the advice of several friends, I thought I am not going to like this at all and I have wasted my money on some kind of Porn book. But as I kept reading, I started to understand more about Christian. My friends told me to keep reading, it really is a good a good book. And they were right. After finishing the first book, I went on line and got books two and three. And they were right again, I really enjoyed them. And I do recommend them for your reading enjoyment. I have a Kindle and I love it. I find I read much more than I use to. My last page is right there for me when I turn on my book. I don't have to look all over the house for books ( tho I have many and keep then in my book case) . And I have so many at my finger tips right in my little black folder.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a 'go to comfort book' for me.  I enjoy watching Mary as life takes her from India to England.  From a spoiled brat to a lovely young lady.<br /><br />Mary has no idea what she is, nor does Colin know what he is.  Between the two of them, they learn, grow, mature and develop a lovely friendship with the help of two not-so-common commoners.  The underlying theme is trust, loyalty and acceptance.  It's a charming book and leaves one with a smile, and a strong desire for a sequel!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Very rarely do I like every song on an CD or whatever we are calling the collection of downloaded music but this was an exception.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|I have enjoyed many of Tom cruise movies, but this one was the worst.  I feel like I wasted my money on renting it.  The plot was predictable, but also disjointed almost as if some scenes were added as an afterthought to make it more believable.  The acting came across as forced and abrupt. The preview was better than the movie itself.
193700788X|1.0|I was a big Sam fan but this book made me question the authors intentions?  Wasn't it a point that Sookie was dating vampires and the like so she would not be able to read their minds?  How would this even work out?  Oh well I guess mrs harris decided to take the paycheck over the accuracy of the series.
B0091XRTTM|1.0|Not for kids, not for adults.  The funniest sections were in the preview.  The rest goes down hill.  Not worth the media it is printed on...
B004TI5N38|4.0|Story lines build gradually without confusing the storyline.  Keeps you wondering what's about to happen next.  Will read more from the author.
B004AO4FJ4|1.0|I don't know why this gets such good reviews.  I hardly ever turn a program off before I get through an episode, but this just sucked.
B009V0TV6O|4.0|Perfect for vacation and traveling but we prefer the real thing at home. (In the opinion of our 12 year old son, who likes to practice on vacation. We have limited travel space so he downloaded this on his kindle)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the show. Didn't think I would ever be able to get into it, now I am hooked! Can't wait for Season 4!
1439152802|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a real page turner. The author manages to maintain the suspense through to the end. She pulls it all together at the end.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|I've read this book at least three times and have given away just as many copies (if not more) to friends, family, and strangers. This book is pure inspiration for anyone actively embracing their life's journey. Read, share, read again.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|the last couple of Reichs' books were off form but she's back on her game with this one. The puzzle is really involved but i'm proud to say I grasped the gist of the solution before the detectives - not that it was easy, she's great at misdirection. The only annoying thing about her books is that she thinks a sentence is a paragraph but i can usually overlook that and in this book it was easy. Very hard to put down (shut off).
B008BTC5E6|4.0|I like the way it is presented, you can learn and at the same time you get involved with the story
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Very soothing and many pleasant sounds to listen to. Nothing I have found that is annoying or too loud..good app!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My daughter and I started watching Downton Abbey about six weeks ago.  We had never seen any of it, but I kept hearing such good things about it and asked her if she would like to watch it with me.  We watched the first two seasons and then ended up buying and splitting the cost of Season 3, watching all three seasons in two-, three- and four-hour marathon sessions.  We have both thoroughly enjoyed Downton Abbey and are waiting for Season 4 now.  The problem is, this time we will have to do as everyone else does, and just wait for the next weekly showing.  ;)  Thank you.  We loved it.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|Alexander does an amazing job making business models something attainable and even fun to create.  Highly recommend this book and the iPad app based on the business model canvas.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I have read 2.5 of the five books and have to make myself spend time with my wife.  Token step aside, here is a medieval fantasy for adults.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it's a fun game although it has not updated in the last 3 days which is a bummer!! But it's still a fun game
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle has given a close up, intimate look at what a Navy Seal' s actual job consists of on an everyday / deployment basis.  By sharing thoughts and emotions of not only himself but others around him, you begin to understand, if only slightly, a part of what makes these warriors capable of providing us all with the protection we much too frequently take for granted.  And much too frequently credit the self serving political arena for results the required actions for which they have no clue.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This was before my time but it's the type of music that lasts. Fleetwood Mac is the type of band that everybody can listen to on the run.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|One of the best movies of the year... Really liked it. All the actora have poured their heart in their roles
B00000269M|5.0|I just had to get music old school. Not that old school but old school enough to make me jump. The music today isn't enough for that.
6302533988|5.0|Another Gem!!!!!!!!!!! These deluxe boxed sets are definitely a must have for collector's, the packaging alone is a selling point!!!!!!!!!!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Last time I used Amazon Instant Video on my Xbox 360 the quality of the service was poor to say the least.  Amazon quickly contacted me and gave me a refund for the rental.  I decided to give it another shot this past weekend and I have to say their service was fantastic!  The picture and sound were amazing!  My wife and I loved the movie and I personally loved how easy it was to stream.
B003ZL60H8|5.0|This is an AWESOME item! Item was shipped promptly and arrived in excellent condition!!!! The price was excellent too, this item is a true collector's gem that is a must have!!!!!! I recommend this seller and shall do business here again!!!!!!!!
B00164GDA0|5.0|My 14 year old son wanted this movie. He loves this movie, great old time movie, its a movie you can watch over and over
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'm going to read it again...<br /><br />Courage and inspiration and spiritual truths weaved into a very believable story of Pi Patel's journey from his religious innocence to the bottom of raw human (animal) instincts, then to the near zenith of his personal truths. Patel's fall from Eden to Hell, and back into God's graceful understanding from his own experiences is the best modern example I've ever seen. I hope the book and the movie will be used for years to teach other's the purpose of personal experience in our quest to be closer to God.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|Yes it is acoustic but it still has all the power of the electric work. It  demonstrates the guitar work and strength. Love the work of Buddy Guy on this as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing. Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer. The book was a big surprise. I can't wait till the movie comes out. Only if it continued to be a series.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|If you love scary movies this is  good. It has some parts to make you jump. watch it alone or with someone.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Great analysis and well written. Different way to seek success and understand its causes and implications. If you are a business person, you will love this book.
B00BF11STU|3.0|This movie was meh at best.  The action was ok, but it drug on foooooooooooooooooooooooooorever! 1 2 3 4 5

B005MLOOJA|5.0|this is a wonderful show, great script..love the characters..and how they interact with each other..one thing I don't like is the lesbian relationships
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love the show! All the characters are well developed and the script is engaging with a few surprises which keeps one hooked on the story. I hope they have a long run, even longer than ER!
1451673442|5.0|to the Secret and the Power.  All three books are great and have changed my life!  I HIGHLY recommend them!
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|Haven't laughed like that in a while. Will forever remember Stephens experience with poison ivy whenever I need to relieve myself in the wild.<br />And it just got better from there onwards<br />Said Ibrahim excitedly - that's for you Stephen, 'cause I know how much you love those adverbs :)
158270208X|5.0|this book is very well made and i LOVE it!  makes me want to write in it.  love the magnetized open/close tab.  AWESOME
1476734941|5.0|Loved it!  Using it.  Working great and losing a bit of weight even though that was not my goal.  Simply wanted to get my body chemistry in good order..
B002M5E2DW|5.0|this book will change your life... as it has mine!  Thank you Thank you Thank you Rhonda Byrne, for sharing this with the world!  I am Truely blessed to have become aware of this book!
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I admit I could get past the first 50 pages of this book.  If the latter pages were anything like the first, I made the right choice.  Read the sample first and see if you agree with me.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Like the Secret and they Magic,  this book goes steps further in guiding you to a joyful, grateful and happy life!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Anything the BBC produces does not disappoint. This is a well done story, great casting and wonderful pathos. Love it.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Good picture and sound quality. This series is one of my great-granddaughter's favorite shows to watch. Thank you for making it available.
0393343405|2.0|So the swerve referred to in the title is a key element in the philosophy of Epicurus, and it is the unexplained motion Epicurus (a younger contemporary of Alexander the Great) needed to add to his belief in a rational universe in which atoms follow nature's laws in order to allow for, among other things, free will.<br /><br />\\"The Swerve,\\" on the other hand, is a mess of a book in which Stephen Greenblatt kept swerving in different directions hoping to find a topic that would justify 262 pages. Unfortunately, the thesis that drives the book could be covered pretty completely in a few thousand words -- and that thesis is that Epicurean philosophy was an integral part of the development of Renaissance thought and the modern world, and it was only luck that allowed it to survive the long centuries unscathed.<br /><br />Fine as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far, so Greenblatt then had to write a whole lot about one Poggio Bracciolini, a 15th century Roman bureaucrat who, like many of his peers, had a passion for antiquities. While out of favor, he discovered a copy of \\"On the Nature of Things,\\" a summation of Epicurean philosophy written by a man named Lucretius -- and Greenblatt wants to claim that discovery was a pivotal moment in the development of the Western mind. And perhaps it was, but that still doesn't justify the 262 pages Greenblatt spends flailing away searching for a topic.<br /><br />Sometimes, \\"The Swerve\\" is a biography of Bracciolini (after fathering 14 children with his mistress, he then, at age 56, married an 18-year-old and had five more children). Other times, the book discusses why and how monasteries copied ancient Greek books, and then are brief forays into the lives of other historical figures, such as Giordano Bruno.<br /><br />Again, all well and good, but hardly the stuff of a cohesive work, and barely worth reading. It only gets two stars because I've always liked the philosophy of Epicurus, and Greenblatt is a competent writer. \\"The Swerve,\\" however, is simply not a very good book.
1476734941|5.0|the book was just what I thought it would be. I am using the info every day. I would recommend it to any one, even if you don't want to loose weight.
0312945973|3.0|I love good historical fiction, and \\"River God\\" is pretty darn good. OK, the depiction of young love is enough to cause insulin shock, and the narrator rivals Ayla of the Clan of the Cave Bear for inventing pretty much anything and everything, on demand, but the fictional dream of Egypt is wonderfully realized in an adventure story that takes some unanticipated twists and turns.<br /><br />This isn't Mary Renault, but it's far from schlock ... and it was a very fun read.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was amazing. The well thought out story, gripping plot, and shocking twists all contributed to this beautifully well made novel.<br /><br />Let's all just hope the next books are as good as<br />the first.
B00AZPXCQE|4.0|This is vintage Caball&eacute;. I found the sound to be a bit boxy and thus the ensembles a bit muddled, but musically this is an excellent performance.
B00CBRAD2A|3.0|It was a bit confusing in the beginning, like there wasn't any motives. Action wise it was good. It could have been written a lot better.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Actually I bought this as a gift for a friend. I bought my copy over a year ago. This is simply spectacular! A huge glorious cast. A huge very enthusiastic audience who clearly knew all the words and singers. The DVD is a celebration and all the songs are sung but it is helpful to know the plot and things between songs are left out. At the end you get to meet the writers and the previous lead singers sing Bring Him Home. You will love this DVD!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|It's was an amazing book that I got from a friend's recommendation and this book has what all good fantasy novels need. Can't wait to start the next one
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can see its value but it's not really my cup of tea.  Great way to keep in touch in a superficial way with friends and family you don't get to visit with often (if ever) in person.  Often however, too much opinion/politics and since I'm quite opinionated myself... anyway, it has been very useful to me in that it has shown me how much compassion I currently do not possess and how much personal work I've left to focus on. That's my review on FB.  Am I supposed to be reviewing the ap? So confusing.  Well, I guess my husband downloaded the ap to my kindle and I don't use it bc of my feeling about FB itself.
B00CE6E6B2|4.0|Great game just wish the zoom feature was a little more user friendly. And why is it that money earned has to disappear so fast. Other than that I spend most of my time in this game. Definitely more entertaining than the real world. Ha ha no good game.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Well, I love Pinterest anyway.  If I have to travel, the ap allows me to access my account on my kindle.  I've seen how it collects photos on my husband's kindle and that looks rather impressive, for sure.  I am kind of a computer dork, so I generally just read on my Kindle.  I haven't done any long distance plane/train travel lately so I haven't had the need to access my Pinterest via anything but my computer. Kind of a bogus review I guess since my 5 star rating is more for Pinterest itself rather than the ap.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I can't get enough of this brilliant artist and this is Bonamassa at his very best, augmented by a deep bench of fabulous supporting musicians.
B0053R1QXU|5.0|Pacino does his usual masterful job in a many faceted role.  Williams is just quirky enough to be menacing.  Even the secondary actors were believable.  But the real kudos go to the screenwriter and director for keeping both intensity and apprehension at a high pitch.  I note that this was a remake of a Norwegian film and was in this case said to be based in Alaska.  Midnight sun is a must for insomnia, but also provides a challenge to set up the mystery normally associated with darkness.
B005HED11Y|5.0|This does not need a review its the Star Trek you love and the changes in remastering are not too distracting so all good.
B009NY43NY|1.0|***SPOILERS TO FOLLOW***<br /><br />I'm not even sure where to start with this review.  It seems like I've been disappointed with the last few books of the series, so in all honesty, I wasn't expecting after that to have this one make a huge comeback in the ratings.  But, I hoped, at the very least.  I can't believe I'm giving a 1 star review for one of my favorite authors, but I have to be truthful.<br /><br />There were so many issues with this book for me. I loved Eric's character, but I never expected he and Sookie would end up together, so my rating has absolutely nothing to do with Sookie ending with Sam.  In truth, I think it makes the most sense and they are the best suited for each other, for a multitude of reasons.  I saw all of Sookie's past relationships as nothing but stepping stones for where she would end up in the end.  I'm not surprised by all of the negative reviews, I agree as well it was one of the worst in the series.  I am surprised by all of the people that really believed she would end up with Eric in the end.  Charlaine Harris has been steadfast from the beginning that Sookie would never end up a vampire. She has said it in every interview, at every book signing, and all over her website.  Even for those who haven't heard her say it herself, Sookie herself has pretty much told us this as well.  Anytime the subject has come up and she has given it some thought, she always reverts back to the face that she just cannot imagine herself as a vamp.  Knowing this alone is enough to have figured there was no way she would end up with Bill, or Eric for that matter.  What relationship is a 60, 70 and 80 year old woman going to be able to share with a 20 to 30 something vampire who never ages?  Even in a paranormal world, the belief that would work is not realistic.  So, no, I wasn't surprised Eric was not going to be her HEA and I was not disappointed that he wasnt.<br /><br />I certainly enjoyed the chemistry her and Eric shared together, but I saw it for what it was...a stepping stone for where Sookie would eventually end up.<br /><br />That being said, I will agree with many others, the ending of their relationship was ended like, well, crap is really the best word I can come up with.  They spent many a books going back and forth about their relationship, and it was the longest one Sookie had throughout the series, so to pretty much end it the way it was done was a really lazy and unfair way to handle it.  If this is the way their relationship was going to end, instead of cramming it into a few short pieces of dialogue, it should have happened in the second to last book, and this book should have given more time to Sookie finding her way to Sam and their relationship blooming.  She was in and out of one serious relationship to another in a matter of pages and it just didn't flow or work.<br /><br />I understand these books have been mysteries, and this is Charlaines genre of choice, but this being the last and final book of the series should have really been about tying up loose ends and fleshing out where she would end up.  We could have done without the attempted murder on Sookie's life, yet again.  And not only was it one group or person out to kill her, but two separate groups of people, not related to the other and for completely different reasons.  Really?  Like we haven't been down that road before.  And another abduction/kidnapping?  Exactly how many times does Sookie need to be kidnapped before enough is enough.  It was an old and played out storyline already.  Move on with something esle.<br /><br />All in all, it was rushed, confusing, and far fetched at best.  Will I still read something from Charlaine Harris in the future?  Sure.  For the most part this series has given me many hours of enjoyment, aside from the last few that were published.  I can only imagine that in this instance she was done with the series and wanted to just throw everything out there and get it finished with.  Unfortunate,because Sookie deserved so much more than that.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|One of the best Sysadmin/Devops books I've read.  The theories and discipline can be applied to old tech companies as well as high tech companies
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book seemed like a typical story of a wrongly accused adolescent until the last part of the book and the unexpected twist at the end.<br />I would have liked the author to expand on certain events and leave less to your own interpretation.<br />Overall a good read.
B00AY0A71I|4.0|Clever humorous spin on a more typical bad guy / good guy story. What can I say it is John Cleese.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I've been reading the Sookie books for years. The first 9 were great. The quality of the later books just got worse and worse. Ms Harris left everything on a flat note. A very ignoble end to what began with so much promise, fun, and adventure.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|I love Sukoku and have been doing them on paper for a long time.  This is the first game I've found that is fun to do on a computer.<br />Depending how I feel at the end of the day I can choose how difficult a game I wish to play.  So easy.

B00BGIC2J2|3.0|It wasn't his best, but it's a Judd Apatow movie. They are light hearted and silly and true to real life. (Hah!) Wasn't my favorite, but also still was better than a lot of other junk out there

B0094BB4TW|2.0|so it took this long to put this app out? Then when its out it sucks...... The app never loads properly, the page doesn't render all the pictures and content on facebook. I don't get it. Way to go Amazon for such a late arrival to the Facebook world then when you get here you give us this turd. Save yourself some frustration and don't get this.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I'll read the next one. Pretty good and believable for the most part. First one of his I've read. Get it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl has lots of good observations and tips on how to get ahead that worked in her experience.  She's right that many women limit themselves, and hold themselves back.  Like the &#34;Secret&#34; , people/women who believe in themselves can do almost anything.  This short book is a pep rally for women's success and you will feel good and energized after reading it!

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved how the character's were separated , then met again and were still so much in love. they didn't give in to there physical selves, but the desire was there. The end was sad but beautiful . There was rescue and saving of life and a spirit of love.

B0083V2VW8|4.0|Contrary to some people's belief, gangs aren't a modern day phenomenon.  In this adaptation of The Who's rock opera of the same name, we get a sense of the 1960's English youth culture.  Groups of uneducated kids still in their teens and early 20's are fed up with authority, having to work for a living and being told what to do.  The music scene is changing as well, as rock `n roll begins to mature with American influences from Motown, rockabilly and R & B are added into the mix.  The lyrics of the music, heavily influenced by The Who of course, fuel the mad-as-hell attitudes.<br /><br />The kids fall into two categories.  One is the mods and Jimmy (excellent Phil Daniels) is one of the local leaders and most rebellious.  The mods drive around on motor scooters which their rivals call \\"hair dryers\\" because of the high pitch sound their engines make.  The scooters are pimped out with multiple headlights and numerous rear view mirrors.  Admittedly I didn't understand the significance of the gaudy additions to these frilly small-wheeled bikes with motors.  The mods are generally well dressed.  Suits and skinny ties are standard uniforms for guys.  And they spend most of their time in clubs, drinking and popping pills.<br /><br />The rival gangs are caller rockers or sometimes greasers.  These are the Elvis or Marlon Brando disciples.  That is, long slick hair, jeans, leather jackets and most importantly real motor cycles.  While the rockers seem older and tougher there are also fewer of them.  One of Jimmy's conflicts concerns his childhood best friend Kev (Ray Winstone) who is a rocker.  The focus of both gangs is to go to the seaside town of Brighton for the week-end.  It doesn't take long for all hell to break loose.<br /><br />The film's focus is on Jimmy however.  As he goes through what is likely a transition period to adulthood, he loses his job, his money and his respect.  His parents kick him out and the girl he loves (Leslie Ash) shuns him after quick alleyway sex.  As a final straw, his hero, Ace Face (Sting), turns out to be just a bellhop during the day.  This leads to a great concluding scene when Jimmy steals Ace's chrome-fendered and ultra modded out Lambretta and heads off to the steep white cliffs for what may be his last ride.  The photography is excellent throughout the film and this final scene is spectacular.  You might scratch your head at the outcome, but just pay attention to the opening scene of the film and everything makes sense.<br /><br />This Criterion Blu ray is very special.  The video a 1080p transfer with the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Depending on the lighting in the film, film grain is highly noticeable which may bother some people.  The Criterion folks did a nice job cleaning up the film but left the original feel in place.  Here are some notes on the transfer from Criterion:<br />\\"This new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on a Spirit 4K film scanner from a 35mm interpositive. It was then color graded on a Baselight 8 digital grading system, under the supervision of director of photography Brian Tufano. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter, and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, and noise reduction.\\"<br /><br />The audio is first rate.  The original 2.0 stereo track is available but opt for the great DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix that was supervised by The Who.  The original music was actually released in a quad format as The Who originally intended, so this wasn't a big leap.  In fact, I still have a working 8-Track tape in quad.  In any case, the film is full of some great music and it is well displayed in surround.  Here is a bit more from Criterion regarding the audio:<br />\\"For this release of Quadrophenia, we created an all-new, remixed 5.1 surround soundtrack, produced at 24-bit using a variety of sound elements from the original album and the 1979 movie. All the Who music was taken from first-generation sources - 4 track 1/2-inch, 8 track 1-inch, and 16-track and 24-track 2-inch analogue tapes - found in the band's archives. In some cases, the songs were reconstructed from scratch from these original multitrack recordings. The film's dialogue and effects were taken from the original 35mm dialogue/music/effects magnetic audio stems. The availability of these separate dialogue and effects stems enabled us to render a detailed and engaging 5.1 audio image. Under the supervision of the band and the film's editor, Sean Barton, a brand-new mix was created at Deluxe 142, in London, by mixer Alan Sallabank, and approved by director Franc Roddam. The staggering result is an immersive experience, and we suggest you play it loud.\\"<br /><br />The package is loaded with special features including a 36 page booklet.  Here are some others:<br />New high-definition digital restoration of the uncut version<br />New audio commentary featuring director Franc Roddam and Tufano<br />Interview with Bill Curbishley, the film's coproducer and the Who's comanager<br />New interview with the Who's sound engineer, Bob Pridden<br />On-set and archival footage<br />Behind-the-scenes photographs<br />Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing<br /><br />Those English subtitles might come in handy, if like me you have a hard time understanding the slang and dialect.

B009VA1FN6|4.0|I rated this book highly because it kept me thoroughly engaged.<br />The attention to detail, be it with the characters, the surrounds , London or the countryside<br />I could visualize it all so clearly.<br />The fact it kept me guessing right up to the last chapter was very good<br />A very well considered novel that I would happily recommend

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I had no idea of the atrocities in the North Korea's concentration camps. The innocents of the character and his enduring hardship were palpable. The hardship of acclimating into a normal society was almost as difficult as being in the camp; without the abuse. Certainly a fascinating, and informative read, I really liked this book.
B003QSPO9K|5.0|This movie is well done and has a little of everything so if you're not sure which type of movie you're in the mood for, this is a great option.
B0060AY85C|3.0|This was not my favorite book by Ms. Morrison. I truly love her work; my favorite being Jazz. I had read all of her works and I think this is my least favorite. Her characters weren't as colorful as in her other novels. I was left wondering, and.... So again I was disappointed and felt that I could have missed this one.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I'm getting ready to start reading the third book.  I didn't know it was made into a HBO series.  Weve been traveling for 5 months.  normally we dont watch TV only movies, but it gets turned on looking for somthing englsh speaking in hotels.  Saw the coming attractions to season 3.  Imagine my surprise.  I bought season 1.  I have 2 episodes left.  It was a great representation of the book, and so fun to watch we can't wait to get in bed and set up my IPad.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|At first I was a bit taken back for lack of the \\"pop\\" iness style...which was in The Block. But...it's all catchy...I LOVE LOVE this...I seriously don't have a favorite because they I LOVE IT ALL. I'm SOOO excited to see them perform this summer!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I read Life of Pi about 5 years ago.  I never imagined it could be portrayed so well in a movie.  It was worth the price of the DVD and more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Highly rated series that is compulsive watching from start to finish. Each character is unique and unforgettable. A scenic wonderment!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I've seen Les Miserables at least 4 times on the stage.  I love the music!  This version is excellent and I'm glad I now have my own copy so that I can watch it whenever I want.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Really like this app.  It can be very challenging sometimes because the screen is hard to see.  But a fun game.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Although I loved the first 3 books and tolerated the 4th one, this book was actually agonizing to read.  As many others have stated, there is virtually no plot development. On the flip side you will get to know way more than you ever wanted to about numerous minor and major characters. Don't get too attached though...Martin's favorite way of dealing with complex characters seems to be killing them off (or creating an incredibly unrealistic back story as in the case of Cersei). I find the comparison between Martin and Tolken laughable at this point. While Tolken's stories seem to be written with the end in mind and a general \\"good triumphs over evil,\\" Martin seems to ramble on and on in a confused and somewhat sadistic state. Dude, check your ego and use your editors!

B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a very clever book. Twists and turns at every corner. However, it was a bit long-winded.  I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Quite anti-climatic. Never name a character \\"Go.\\"  It's very distracting.

076790592X|5.0|A great classic stands the test of time. This book has been on my to-read list for years, and I finally got to it! This story of a relationship between a professor stricken with ALS, and his past student/now sports writer is full of life lessons. Here is the professor's formula for finding a meaningful life: \\"Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.\\" Thoughts like this make this book a true gem.
B005PK57IK|4.0|I watched the first two seasons of this through netflix.  I was disappointed with the second season and thought I would give up on it.  When I got my Kindle Fire and saw that I could watch season 3 for free, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  Season 3 redeemed the series for me.  The characters became more real and Alicia came into her own!  Now I have to wait patiently for season 4 to become available for free!!!
B0026PW67W|1.0|It's just a big piece of paper - I can't believe the money that this costs and really it should be a lot cheaper.

B006J420UE|3.0|I originally bought this for my newly built media center per an online review.  Sadly I found out the hard way that this CPU is far too powerful for a media center.  The fan that comes with it is much too loud for a 'media' environment.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Great series and this is where it all began.  I love all 3 seasons and regularly run them on a cycle. They tackled social issues within the context of a storyline. The first season had the greatest episodes. This side of Paradise almost breaks your heart for the line you hear from Spock as the episode closes out. City on the Edge of Forever is another heartbreaker--but what a story! So many other reasons... this is where all the real space-enalia began! Thank you Star Trek, and of the three seasons (all good) this is far and away the best.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I feel that Brandon is just as good at the short story/novella medium as he is at the ridiculously long novel, and The Emperor's Soul is no exception. Obviously he cannot go as in-depth as he would with a full-length story, but since it is set in the same world as another story, he spends more time with the characters than with world-building. The magic system is, as always, unique and interesting, and you really feel yourself getting closer to the characters throughout the tale. If you want more of Brandon while you wait for the next book, then go ahead and pick up The Emperor's Soul. You won't be disappointed.
B0090EKRKU|3.0|A cute story, with a very nice ending--my only issue probably rests mostly with me---some parts just seemed to be long-winded babbling prattle. I just can't stay focused that long on some of these animated types of movies--I'm sure my nephew would be appalled at the rating but he doesn't pay the bills. :)
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|WOW!  NK is not a place to live or to take the kids on vacation.<br />Not a good plot but very informative. We just don't know how good we have it.<br />Beside going to war, How does that regime get replaced?
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|This is a series that I can not stop watching...even though it just never seems to end! I love this set and I need to buy the second season set as well!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|The food industry goes to great lengths to keep us in the dark about the horrors for food production. The cruel and unsanitary conditions animals are kept in to the genetically altered seeds that they have copyrights on and take people to court if they try to use their left over seed instead of buying new seed. And we're the losers. Contaminated meat, hormones and disease. If cows go from corn to grass feeding, 80% of ecoli is removed from their system. Corn and high fructose corn syrup are everywhere. Read this poster about what it does to the human body. https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/544559_561553913864229_1055872950_n.jpg It's all about MONEY. Not nutrition, safety, treating people or animals well or public health. The FDA has been reduced to a small force that can only do a small fraction of what they used to do.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|There was action, suspense and emotion in this story.  I loved the connection between the two main characters.  If you enjoy the tough, action hero types you will like King and Maxwell.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|But if that's what you're looking for, it'll do the job just fine.  Some mechanics could be improved, but a good effort none the less, and I'm sure the developer will work out some of the minor bugs people complain about eventually.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|While these books were written poorly, they are really worth the read. Decent story. I enjoyed them a lot despite the author's cringe-worthy lack of a vocabulary or thesaurus.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Well, yes,  I think recharging the Sun is a challenge most movies have not attempted, but, aside from that, the plot is routine. That does not mean you will not enjoy it, just don't expect it to stretch your mind or imagination. (How many of this kind of film do?). I found it enjoyable. With some exceptions, the actors performed well, the plot allowed some leeway for individuality, it had a few surprises, and it did not linger too long on the technicalities invented for the film. I don't know any of the performers, so cannot comment as to whether this was a typical or superior performance by them.<br />I would  recommend the movie for  \\"non-specialists\\" in the very overworked<br />'Space' genre which has so taken  television and the film in recent decades. If you have sat through as many hours as such a person will have done, this is unlikely to break through as anything worth seeing. Given my limited viewing, I found it reasonably entertaining.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|Expected more detail regarding teenager's death. Biggest disappointment was build up through book where body was hidden but no actual discovery of it by end of book. Well written, just a personal letdown for me on storyline.
0780631684|3.0|Obviously, I took a wrong turn  in the multiplex, so to speak, and wound up with the teen-age movie.  What did I think of this film clearly made for another audience group.  Can't say how the  audience for whom it was intended reacted, but I felt it was not bad for a juvenile piece. The young actors weren't asked to do much and were competent in their roles. The plotting provided some decent scenes although it hardly sparkled with fearsomeness. In general, there is no gore to speak of,  a couple of times we approach the limits of acceptability but these are easily missed without disrupting the flow of the film.<br />For the younger set this is probably an OK film, for the older set it is modestly entertaining.
B008602KQI|3.0|After hearing so many superlatives about this one I was not impressed so easily. Surly it is a great movie, and one you cannot miss, but I am not sure why I thought it will be one of those movies you can watch over and over again, but it is not. The main reason is that it is too long. Almost 3 hours.
B00A2AU0KI|1.0|I thought I was ordering a dvd. I havent watched it yet.It was a waste of money. I still want the dvd, but, I'm not gonna shell out the dough again.

The chapters are short and the language is clear, but don't let this fool you.<br />The concepts here are deeper than they may appear to the less experienced artist.<br /><br />The book affirmed many life lessons that I have learned over the years and confronted me with some demons that  I have yet to vanquish.<br /><br />I'm going through the book for a second time and suspect that I will revisit it again and again.
0545265355|5.0|My daughter-in-law started me on the first book when I was in KS.  When I finished the first book, I wanted to read the second book and she didn't have it.  It was chea[er to purchase the trilogy set than it was to purchase the books separately besides now I have the set.  I recommend the book to anyone and even though I'm still reading the second book 'Catching Fire' I can't wait until the third book.  As a grandmother who used to be a 'book worm' in my younger days before marriage, children and a career the Hunger Games got me back into reading which is a pastime  I deeply miss.  Thanks to my beautiful daughtrer-in-law who get me back into reading as it has captivated me with all of the elements of a good story.  I highly recommend this trilogy to young adults and adults who are not into reading or lookng to get back into reading as it will keep your attention constantly.  That is why I gave it 5 stars!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Don't miss this one; it's great.  It is filled with surprises that make it a fun read.  Not what I expected.
B00AJAFNIA|2.0|No matter how fast I go up, that crab always gets me. I don't really get the game, all I do is bounce from planet to planet.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|A must see if you are interested in an outer world experience. Aliens, humans, explorers, ancient history and mythology. Plus, who wouldn't want to see Richard Dean Anderson in action again
B002361MLA|5.0|I believe his teachings should be studied by all.  He is a true guide to inner peace, joy and love.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|During the week we prepare longer to cook items and the weekends the shorter ones. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to add neighbors.
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|Very good to see all the MI movies on Amazon Prime. The whole series is clever and hits the mark for Hollywood action.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Written well and with a great sense of humor. I am almost done with it and already regret that &#34;the end is near&#34;.
B009PLKPMS|5.0|My best friend LOVES McFly and I found this CD and had it imported just for her and she loves it!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|What can you say about a classic? I read this series years ago and decided I would like to have it available on Kindle.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I had heard it was a tear-jerker, but was it ever! The book covers a lot of thought provoking topics that aren't normally discussed, so I would highly recommend it.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Wow! This film is a faithful and fantastic adaptation of Dennis Lehane's powerful novel. Dark, emotional, and gripping. Fantastic performances by all of the actors, and a well written script. I will never grow tired of watching this film, and I do not have a particular affinity for crime drama.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ok think the game is awesome ,because you get to change the habitats but most importantly the dino world they look so cool and the quests you do are fun and earn money and lots of other stuff!!!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Fun, entertaining, and well written. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect Tony Stark. This is a superhero action movie with a beating heart. I LOVED it!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Nice price, quick shipping, and as advertised.<br /><br />Wife will enjoy giving it to her mom, and our friend enjoyed it as well.<br /><br />Not much else to see here!
B00BDAP66E|3.0|It is ok...can't really see all of facebook and can't edit any post.  I still have to go to the desk top or laptop to do all the stuff I thought this was going to do for me.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This has saved my husband from a beat down on a couple of occasions.  Good information to know in any relationship, fun to place other friends and family.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Gripping intense great book! I couldn't put it down ! The ending is a great surprise! It is a must read!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Any writer who has a book out, should read this.  Whether you are traditionally published or self-published, most writers have to market themselves and their books.  Gives a lot of practical advice on how to market yourself and your books.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have this on my iphone as well as my kindle and I love it; I use it more on my kindle because it is easier to use/see. Recommended!
B002LFVE4I|3.0|It is okay, but only Maggie Smith saves it.  Just never really seem to get to know the characters enough to care.
1449437524|5.0|Today I was perusing the shelves of Barnes & Noble and I found this short (only 32 pages) and hilarious book by Matthew Inman, My Dog: The Paradox: A Lovable Discourse about Man's Best Friend.  Let me just start by saying, that this is a laugh out loud sort of comic book for dog lovers everywhere about the hilarity of our furry friends, our lifelong friends, the good and constant pals, our dogs.<br /><br />You may have even already seen some of Matthew's hilarious comics on [...]  So if you're an animal person, have a sense of humor, enjoyed How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You, or even a pulse then this book is for you!  A must read for anyone who has ever had a dog!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good game.  Wish their was bigger tiles but very enjoyable. And I actually really enjoy the background music. It's very relaxing.
B0087DFIYA|4.0|Mel is great here. Funny, cool and slick. The story is original and scenery is moody giving a nice backdrop. Saw it on demand and  think Ill buy the dvd soon. A fun action adventure with a few surprises...
B001KT6JPA|1.0|Why here is a man who spends years in prison, solitary no less, and he comes out living 'an Anthony Hopkins' kind of life!i! Wow, lucky you Hannaibal!<br />Maybe the fact that I work with people who live with mental illness every day of their lives in their substandard housing and the stigma of being sick and the in and out of jail they get for STUPID things like telling someone they live in the nice house they got into and decided to fix a sandwich because they were hungry!!!,; unnerving but nothing a stay in our totally ignorant system of justice cant take care of.<br />No one I ever deal with has ever been as PREPARED as he was to resume life on the outside. Gee Hannibal, maybe you could tell us your secret so we could help people with REAL MENTAL ILLNESS who should not be incarcirated, how to live once they get dumped on our mean streets?????<br />I hate the lie this kind of movie perpetuates in our ignorant culture about mentally ill people.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|Was an okay movie, nothing really spectacular in my eyes,  Rented it for a flight to kill time, had watched the ending on tv and wanted to watch it from the beginning.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is the reason you go to movies! ALL AROUND EXCELLENT and unique...........forget the rest...rent this and you will not regret it.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This one wasn't as good as the first book, but definitely worth the read.  The world problems are believable...you can see how we could go from the world today to the world in this book.  It's full of twists and turns and leaves you wondering what is real and what is part of the trial.  I will definitely be reading the next book!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It has good acting, a great story, and production values (Sets, costumes, special effects, etc.).  Definitely a must see ror anyone who likes the book especially.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great dystopian novel.  You really care what happens to the characters.  I'm hooked!  Can't wait to read the next one!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|it is so like so many of the other games I got bored with it and deleted it from my tablet, no since have extra stuff I do not need.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|Go where no one has gone before! Classic Star Trek I loved that amazon prime instant video is carrying great movies keep them coming!
1936719010|5.0|Read it in hours. Then read it again. I feel more inspired to get to work again. It is a good kick in the butt to make sure you do not let your talent go to the wayside.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I started with the first Bosch book and am working my way through the series. Harry Bosch is my kind of guy!
B003E2UQMS|4.0|The fact that book is nothing like the movie doesn't make it bad . But in the coontrary it made somehow different and interesting . I liked the fact that book was a bit more realistic that the movie and that it was more detailed .
B008133MDK|5.0|It is fantastic, extremely well made, with great actors and can't wait for season 3.  The BBC has come a long way with their shows.
6305922756|5.0|The price was right.<br />The quality was great.<br />Plays with no issues.<br />And came on time!!<br /><br />Yes, this was a great deal!!
B004TJ1H3C|2.0|I did not enjoy this Stargate series.  I stopped watching after the first few episodes.  It was to far from the original Stargates in class.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Well written as usual. Easy read and I find myself wanting to find out what's coming next. It's book makes me laugh out loud as I read!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|what a great way to waste time! I like to challenge myself to obtaining 3 stars! Great for a free game. can be addicting so be careful.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What disappointed me most was that the seasons were too short!!! I got hooked after the first episode and can't get enough. You immerse yourself into the lives of the Crawleys AND their staff and love the drama!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|We read for years. We were devoted fans for years. We supported,upheld, & eagerly awaited ANYTHING you wrote,....for. years. Look at your college educated children, your lovely belongings and your SEP IRA. We did that for you. And Dead  Ever After is what you tossed us like so much garbage. You, Madame, are the Marie Antionette of series. I'd give this a 1/4 star if I were able, as an afterthought; just because that is exactly what YOU gave US.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I had never done KDP before, and I needed all the information I could get. This book gave me basic formatting information, so I was able to &#34;build&#34; my book as I went along. I didn't have to go back and edit a lot. I would recommend this book for the newbies who want the basics. I know I will need to learn more as I get more involved in e-publishing, but this was a great book to start with.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Excellent movie! I loved the way the character's emotional states were portrayed . Everything about this movie was wonderful ! A must see.
193700788X|1.0|Reading this book was the one time I wish I had it in paperback so I could throw it across the room, which I would never do with my Kindle.  So unbelievably disappointed in how she ended this series.  It was as if she gave up on trying to tell a compelling story and this was basically a cop-out.  ****Spoiler Alert****  Sam...Sookie ends up with Sam.  After 12 books of hearing how she never felt that way about him, the author uses the cluviel dor to explain why she is now in love with Sam.  It's like the author couldn't figure out how to get Eric out of Freyda's clutches and gave up.  Why would anyone believe she wanted to be with Sam and not Eric.  Eric was always such a strong character and he should have been able to figure out how to get what he wanted.  I'm disappointed that I even bothered reading this last book.  I almost wish I had stopped at the last one and made up my own ending.  We should all ask the author for a do-over and see if she can get it right the 2nd time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter wanted this game and once she asked me to play it with her it was addicting.  We take turns on it and I have found it to be a great bonding time.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I loved this movie and so happy to have my own copy and can watch when ever I want to.  The packaging was great and arrived in great condition.  Thank you.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|As usual, Michael Connelly makes the characters in the book become ALIVE.  The great &#34;Lincoln Lawyer&#34; has me worried, but he finally gets it done.  The plot thickens as I turn each page.  I'm shocked at the ending.  Read and enjoy.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This film possessed all the qualities of an action movie, serious drama, spine-tingling thriller, romantic love story, and family classic in one.  The fact that it is a true story makes it all the more awesome.  Naomi Watts was incredible.
B008Y73940|4.0|This is a good movie, especially if you are a fan of Matthew McConaughey.  A good character for him.  I liked it.
1476734941|4.0|I have been on the diet for 5 weeks and lost 12 lbs.  It is like any other diet you have to exercise to get the best results.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher movies and was not sure if Tom Cruise could pull off a &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; but he did! I hope to see some more from this series on film.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Read it in three days... Wish I didn't have to wait for the next one... Write faster Jeffrey ... Highly recommended
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I didn't care for the whole space motif.  There seemed to be no real control over where the birds went.  They were just flying around willy-nilly in zero gravity.  If any pigs were hit, it was strictly by luck.  Maybe others will like it more, but I didn't.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|interesting accounts of slavery from the slaves point of view as well as the indentured servants - no there is no such thing as a &#34;good master&#34;.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This was so much fun to play!  I couldn't help laughing at those crazy monkeys.  I liked the original Angry Birds.  This just throws a little bit of good old fashioned fun on top of it.  I had no issues with the way the game played, no freezing up, no shutting down.  I just had a good time playing it.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino tactfully draws back the shade on the dark underbelly of America's great shame- slavery- and the result isn't easy to swallow. Django Unchained is an ugly, gruesome, ruthless film...and I loved every second of it.<br /><br />The uncharacteristically chronological narrative follows the journey of ex-slave Django (Jamie Foxx) and his bounty hunting liberator (Christopher Waltz) as they attempt to free Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from twisted plantation owner and mandingo curator Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio.)<br /><br />This splatterfest symphony has all the earmarks of a Tarantino film- flashy superimposed text, snappy dialogue, terse banter, larger than life characters and an emotional revenge narrative- but it uses the backdrop of the slave-ridden south to expose the nastiness of our nations past. The sad truth- this is pulp fact, not fiction.<br /><br />While we can conjecture about the historical accuracy of the film, it's probably all more true than we'd like to admit. Tarantino sweeps the most unpalatable of human nature from under the rug and into our faces and we can't help but watch paralized. In an interesting juxtaposition to this years similarly-themed Lincoln, Django may not be the history lesson we want but it's probably the one we deserve.<br /><br />Without the vast talent of its cast, Django may have fallen flat and lost its emotional oomph. Thankfully, every performer in this sprawling epic places their definitive stamp on their varied roles with great success.<br /><br />Waltz is easily the highlight, not only of this film but of the entire year, as he chews up the scenes with masterful gusto. He has a mysterious way of making you listen to his each and every word, perfectly slung like the sweet-talking gunfighter he is. Waltz is the ideal vessel for Tarantino's trademark dialogue and their pairing is a perfect marriage we can hope to see prosper for many years to come.<br /><br />Foxx plays the titular Djangowith swagger and style. He's a no-frills badass with a crystal clear motive and he executes his worthy mission with trigger-happy snark.<br /><br />In a career first, DiCaprio assumes the role of the villain and is downright venomous.  A highlight of the film involves him and Waltz in a confrontation about a handshake that will be sure to leave you shaken and wowed.<br /><br />And last but not least is Samuel L. Jackson, who hasn't been this good since his unforgettable turn as Jules in Tarantino's sophomore phenomenon- Pulp Fiction. This nasty-hearted head house-slave may not be spouting Ezekiel but his conniving ways are equally malicious and chill-inducing.<br /><br />As should be expected, there are moments where Tarantino is overindulgent- I could have used about five minutes of riding horses through various landscapes and a couple unfitting musical numbers edited out- but it's all a part of a great and sprawling film that's not only highly stylized but injected with a urgent sense of purpose. Plus, has gangster rap ever played better in a feature film?<br /><br />While it's not for the faint of heart- be prepared for torrents of blood and no short measure of the \\"n-word\\"- Django Unchained is that rare masterpiece that will have you laughing out loud one moment and in jaw-dangling horror the next.<br /><br />All the performers involved are hitting their mark with pitch perfect bravado and Tarantino once again proves that he's the king of cinema.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I decided to watch this simply because I like Nathan Fillion.  I'd never even heard of this show before finding it here on Amazon.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was fast-paced, humorous and interesting.  The cast was amazing.  I liked seeing familiar faces before they became, well, familiar.  It's a shame that the network mismanaged the original airing of the series so badly that there was just no way it could have succeeded, but it now has a fairly large cult following from what I understand.  I'll be renting the movie 'Serenity' to see how it all ended up.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Even though Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus are more for the younger reader I've read all the books of both the series, though i haven't started with the Egyptian stories yet. I love mythology and I like how the author has kept the mythology and given each god/goddess a particular personality sometimes likable most of the time interesting.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|A great set of stories about Jean Valjean interrupted by histories of France, Parisian streets, swears, etc...  Never though of abandoning it, but admit to skipping many pages.  Might recommend to some, but would never consider reading it again.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|When i read the sample i thought the book sounded really interesting, and this was before the book was becoming popular. I bought the first one to see what i thought of the series and i found i was thoroughly annoyed and at times bored with the story. I often felt like i was reading about Twilight characters as the descriptions of the characters often seemed  cut and pasted from Twilight and i also got annoyed with the amount of times the characters were having sex and ended up skipping pages until a proper story line began again. I did not get any more of  this series as i heard it does not get any better.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I was very moved by this film, which had the right amount of humor and tragedy to make it a great drama.
B0031RS8UI|4.0|I enjoyed this Sophie Kinsella novel, its not my top favourite but definitely fun and enjoyable with fun characters and a funny and likable storyline.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Great scenery, sound, production. But boring and stupid.  Not worth my time or money.  I gave it three stars just because some of the action scenes were extremely well done.  But overall a waste.
B0031RS8AI|3.0|Of the Sophie Kinsella books, this would not be my favorite thought it was enjoyable. I thought i would try the first one but I didn't buy any more of the series. My favourite books where, 'Have i got your number' and 'twenties girl'. I hope more books like that come out.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|A slavery fantasy film similar to the Jewish was fantasy film Inglorious Basterds.  It gives satisfaction on so many levels as well as teaching you something along the way.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is amazingly effective as Bond. I already own, his previous two, and will continue to collect up-coming titles starring him!
B00908DDZM|5.0|I'm still a little old school at times appreciating an actual disc to pop instead of yet another mp3, and I'm glad I not only got this CD but chose to invest in Macklemore.  I love the hip hop tango delivered between Macklemore and his counterpart on vocals Ryan Lewis.  The former has brilliant lyrics, I love his anti-establishmentarianism, He rails eloquently against parts of the machine that just don't make sense.  His Same Love song is extremely touching, and entirely supportive, and I thank him openly for performing it.  Ryan Lewis brings a counterpoint in vocals with a strong vibrato that just jams well with the songs.  I also appreciated the production company's choice to provide this disc in environmentally friendly/non-jewel CD case.  I cannot recommend this purchase enough!
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|entertaining at the least, there have been others like it but this is new and with different characters,so give it a whirl.
B00BCV3HGU|4.0|Will.I.Am had me hooked at &#34;Scream and Shout&#34; and I looked forward to getting a whole disc of fun tunes to jam to.  #Willpower delivers exactly that.  Fantastic beats to rock to, drive to, work out to.  Sure, folks have indicated he's sampled other artists, but he also gives a nod to the artists he sampled, I'm good with that.  Will.I.Am delivers talent in a dance/hip hop fashion that works for me, I'd recommend this CD to others seeking the same.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This movie was a great treat.  Unlike so many movies where you see the best part in the preview, this movie kept me laughing and the entire family loved it.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|A TRUE DISASTER MOVIE THAT IS TOTALLY BELIEVEABLE. JUST AN OUTSTANDING MOVIE THAT TOOK ME BY COMPLETE SURPRISE, DUVALL AND MORGAN FREEMAN WERE 5 STAR AS IS THE MOVIE
B0064MGU98|5.0|1st rate acting and story line. Good mix of continuing stories and weekly stories, keeping the viewer wanting to see next episodes.
B007XNTDPA|1.0|Childish boring very predictable plot - boring predictable characters - had to double check - cant believe it was a Grisham book
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This is a fun & challenging game. My grandson & I play it often. It helps with hand eye coordination
0767812646|4.0|Movie was wonderful. Reminds me of the first time I saw it. Superb acting. Love Jack Wilde even before H.R. Puffenstuff.
B008J05EL8|1.0|It does not even load. At first it doesn't load, then I had to delete it and try again and it still didn't  work
6300263673|4.0|Like the music, love the stars. Great performance by Patrick Swayze. This is the way I'll always remember him. A real keeper
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THE LITTLE GUY OVER THE WALL. BUT IT SURE IS FUN TRYING TO GET HIM OVER
B008602KQI|5.0|I watched this dvd with my husband one evening, I had read the book, he hadn't. He had no idea what it was about. He also did not know it was \\"young adult\\". We watched it all the way through without pausing for breaks. It was very well made and stayed clase to the book storyline. My rating is based on the fact that hubby's comment that he can't wait for the next movie. My comment was that I need to read the following book and then see the movie.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|don't like game summarys to show up on facebook.  like my privacy on facebook.  everybody does not need to know everything I do.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series.  Just wish there were more seasons!  Great that I can watch it for free as an Amazon Prime member.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|was good playing and earned 12 of 37 badges.  now when tapping to play game , it goes to wooga page welcoming you back but wont go back to game to play.  it does the same thing every time
1609611543|5.0|I lost 18 pounds in a month and 4-1/2 inches with starving.  I have been on this almost a year and it is not hard to stay on once you see the results.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Reminds me of good times when you would go to the game room or pizza parlor,like the glow no problems
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|An amazing finish to a beloved series. It was an epic fight from begining to finish. Reading that 14 book series was worth it for this book.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|This was a book that has a lot of useful information.  I think the author is correct in that experienced people can leave off important steps and having a checklist is an excellent way to deal with this problem.  Checklists definitely improve performance and should be used.  I think he could have gotten to the important parts faster.  However, I'll temper the criticism because perhaps the author was trying to build his case. I'm not in the medical field, so I enjoyed reading it.
1844137872|5.0|...it's great.  If you know Banksy, this is a great little collection of his works.  I've bought two and gave them away as gifts.
B008K9UZY4|3.0|I purchased this game for my son he has really enjoyed it. It is very entertaining and has given him hours of fun. I highly recommend it.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|A couple of people told me that this movie is negligible, but of course I was going to see it anyway.<br />It was not comparable to her other work, in quality, but it was Barbra, nonetheless.  Part of the reason I like her is that she is familiar.  I was raised in a liberal, Jewish home, have spent a fair amount of time in New York, and I'm blunt and musical.  She touches all of those parts of me.  While there was no music in this movie, all the other parts were there.  I enjoyed it.  4 rather than 5 stars, because while it was enjoyable, it wasn't fabulous;)
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Okay overall...not quite as intense or violent as I expected, but rather the same old thing with just the details changed. Entertaining - just not earth-shattering.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|Storyline was, of course, repetitive....but I could tell Ben wasn't right...and it took too long to wrap up.<br />I just didn't like the ending.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|OK. I prefer procedurals without quite as much gotcha surprise, but the acting is great and the story pretty interesting.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|It's a great show. I've been following it from the first season to it's present season. It's nice that Amazon has all the seasons to view for those that are just getting interested they can watch it from the first to it's present season. Others have it but amazon has it so you can view it on line with out dvd's which make's it easier.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|What a graphic movie.  Saw it once, but not a second time.  Once was enough.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|They are still making great music.  It sounds new and fresh. I can't wait for the concert to see it live!
B007L6VR12|3.0|Edward Norton stars in this movie as a camp ground moderator.  There are many campers and one boy who wishes to escape with his new sweetheart female.  The hunt for the missing couple and find them.  I personally enjoy Edward Norton but I found this movie less entertaining than expected.
B007MAETA8|3.0|I love love love John Mayer...but this album wasn't the best.  It's very depressing...and not enough of his signature guitar.
B00196YNWU|4.0|I recently watched this film with my daughter.after not having seen it for years. It was just as much fun as I remember. Carol Burnett is hilarious. My daughter loved it and is still singing the songs.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is a great way to have all of her hits together on one album.  You'll love this one too!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|It's so good it should probably be on HBO.<br /><br />I was late to the party as I didn't start watching The Good Wife until midway through season 3 (I think the title of the show made it seem like something I wouldn't enjoy). I'm now completely caught up from season 1 through season 4 and I wish I had more episodes to watch.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|I love her song writing...even in her earlier albums.  If you're a Taylor Swift fan, you must add this CD to your collection.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a great read, as I like procedural stories that are technically minded.  This first-hand account was a page-turner, despite knowing how it all ends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game but since there is an update just about every month my friend hasnt even updated hers to \\"Rio\\" because she doesn't have enough room
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|5 yr. old granddaughter loved playing this game and found it easy to play.  Fit in with a learning unit on plants and gardening too!
B000FC1PNE|4.0|I usually read Kleypas, But the Bridgerton series are a happy and welcome surprise.  Not a lot of hot and heavy parts but a lot of romance.  Romance is the reason we read them, Right?  I love this family, and have read all but three. They are very addictive. I Read this one in one day, or should I say night.  I came home form work and literally stayed up all night and finished it.  I only got two hours of sleep, but it was worth it. Great book.Good Good read!
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is one sexy, intriguing, unique and original show. It reels you in and doesn't let you go. I can't wait for the 3rd season
B003CN5SAY|5.0|Don't you hate it when you really love a show and suddenly it's over? Nip/Tuck was one of my favorites. Now I have all seasons. Very pleased with my purchase.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|An xfiles like storyline with differences. I enjoy watching tv without the annoyance of tv commercials. Another benefit of streaming is the PAUSE button.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I really love this DVD concert! Much better than others I own. Every song is wonderfully performed up close and personal. Leonard, you're not getting older but ripening into a fine vintage! Bravo!
B008602KQI|5.0|Has a bit different feeling than the book, but I love it.<br />The pageantry, the sets, the completely surreal yet familiar world, katnis's humanity in the face of a cruel and broken system.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Very funny, I think Sophie Kinsella's best one out of all of them...I liked it even better than the Shopaholic books.
B00AWFEBDK|3.0|It is the most long-winded and least interesting of all Jared Diamond's books.All his previous works were original and thought-provoking. This one wasn't.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved it just like all the other books. Really wish the story between sookie and Eric was explored more in this book. I felt like more needed to happen there given there tumultuous relationship. I also kept waiting for that confrontation between Eric, sookie and the queen of Oklahoma but that wasn't explored to my dismay. Toward the end I saw where things were heading and it was a twist but I think it was well deserved. I think sookie would lead a more \\"normal\\" life but I can't help but wonder if she would miss the excitement of the vampire world. I keep hearing that this will be the last sookie novel but I hope not. There is still so many story lines that could shoot off from here. All in all these characters have become like family/old friends and I've enjoyed ever single book in this series! Thank you so much Mrs Charlaine Harris for your vision and creativity with this series and the way you have brought them to life...being from Lafayette La and living in places like Bernice and now Pineville La I am very familiar with the cities that are in the books. It's wonderful! Thank you again!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Even though I don't enjoy Victorian romances this was really well written. I enjoyed the primus that a Duke stirring up trouble. I really love Courtney Milan. I can't wait for the next book
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is addictive! I love the unlockable upgrades and achievements, it gives you a sense of accomplishment. The controls are fun and take advantage of new tablet technology.
B00881PTRC|4.0|A great program with fun graphics that'll help you pass the time.  Loads of variety in the words available, and you can even add your own.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A story of an Indian boy on a voyage with a companion like no other. A classic. Be ready for a great movie-watching experience.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Couldn't put it down...full of suspense and twists and turns.  Haven't read Jeffrey Archer in a long time but will do so more frequently now.
B006S02EKK|4.0|Paris and women's fashion and the people who make the fashion industry what it is are the stars of this Robert Altman flic. Lots of sex, satire, dog shit, laughs, and an all star cast make this good escape fare.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|My whole family enjoyed watching this movie together. There is something in it for everyone. Definitely would recommend for family movie night.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|Like a pad of stick notes, this does the job with no problems. I can keep lists that don't justify a word processing document. It's a great place for the miscellaneous small lists of items that don't require security, but offer quick and convenient reference. For example, I keep all my medications and my medication schedule on ColorNote where I can find and edit it while my doctor explains any needed changes. Since I always have my Kindle Fire handy, such lists are right on hand with my favorite books, e-mail, a game, weather, and Map Quest. A very good packa in less space that one paperback.<br /><br />ColorNote fits this package perfectly.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is amazing. I love this app I can write reports on it or just write what I want to remember.
B0017SWSCW|3.0|I started off liking the book, but it felt a little too similar to one of his other books and it seem to just go on, I got bored.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|I would have been disappointed if I had paid Theater prices to see it. It was an OK movie.  It was well done and entertaining.  Not one I'd watch over again.  A bit over acted (Tom Cruise, what else).  I wish they wouldn't show him running.  He looks a little like a sissy.
B00991TCOG|4.0|when I finish listening to the whole cd, I play it over again. I don't get tied of her violin.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Best. Show. Ever. Can't stop watching. Im Going to run out of episodes soon. New season can't come soon enough.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great read.  Keeps you on the edge that a person could be that sick.  Feel sorry for both characters.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a well laid out, easy to use calculator. I like how easy it is to use. It is also very easy on the eyes.
B00BWJ6JO4|2.0|Many interruptions in downloading. The sound was way too low, even with all of the settings on the highest volume.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG...Subway surfer is the best game ever and it never gets borring!!! I play it all the time. U can go to different places around the world... how cool is that!!! :)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this every night! Get the premium, it is cheap and worth it. It offers a lot of different sounds and you can play as many as you like together, unlike most where you can only choose one. So you can choose city noises with night sounds and rain for a very realistic combo. The sounds are ok on the Kindle but that is a function of the speakers not the app. Put in your earbuds for the real experience. It also has a timer and there is some explaination I never read about which ones are at which frequencies and how to mix them. Oh and they offer 3 or 4 kinds of noise. They have white noise, pink noise, brown noise and 2 others I think.<br />really great app.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|If you are looking for good clean fun, romance, and mystery/intrigue all wrapped into an awesome gift package, Castle is it. Be forewarned, it's addicting.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I absolutely love this book, and cannot wait to read the rest of the series.<br /><br />I had never read a \\"steampunk\\" book before and I was very impressed. This is a gritty romance with strong characters. I literally could not put the book down! Can't wait for them all!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|In the pilot when Castle profiles Beckett and the look on her face...right then and there, I fell in love. I've been enjoying the ride ever since. Yahoo!
B00CBRAD2A|1.0|sorry to say its just not worth the time.  sorry i rented it.  have seen just about every movie arnold ever made,enjoyed most.  skip this one. a weak effort all around. totally absurd plot, characters you can't relate to or believe. they could have made this a lot, lot better.... and should have.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Hopefully you are not watching the fourth season without the first three, and if you are on the fourth you've caught the addiction. Castle continues to deliver all the elements that makes it superb tv entertainment. So sit back, relax, and throughly enjoy!
B00947N6UG|4.0|We weren't entirely sure what to expect of this movie (missed seeing it in the theaters), but we were very happy with it! Enjoyable for the whole family and I can't wait to see if there will be spin-offs!
B003L77FYS|5.0|The third season of Castle is thus far it's best. The writers, characters, and actors playing those characters have gotten their groove on~ and it's an awesome ride!
B001GA1RFA|4.0|A fun, quick read. John Green just has a way of writing characters and stories that pull me in and keep me wanting more. This book didn't quite leave an impression on me like Green's later novels, but the read was definitely fun and entertaining.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love it! Love it!  I told everyone I know to read this book.  Very well written and highly intriguing! Couple parts at the end I disputed with friends but was highly impressed.  I spent many a nights going over the plot in my head!  Don't miss it.
B002LBKDYE|5.0|Exccelent movie that realy explains the way companies treat our food the animals and us. Should be seen by the whole family.
B008MM9630|4.0|It is fun.  However the game froze and I had to restart my kindle, and then start over.  No problem since then.  I'm still hopeful that it continues to work.  The graphics are good.
B007NWCZR4|3.0|I love and admire PSP for their clever literary lyrics and clever catchy music.  I usually buy my albums from them without the benefit of sampling.  I can't complain though, reviews forewarned these were B songs compiled together--and gasp!  That's what they were. Listless and forgettable.  I don't listen to this collection anymore.  I WILL be buying their June 2012 release with full confidence, however.  ONE MORE THING THAT IRKED ME: It was advertised as a two-disc set.  Which it was.  But with only one song on the second disc, and all the rest--silence.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Nice package of the original movie with three commentaries and a good selection of special features that give the background information on the movie.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Very well done and thought-provoking. A must view for any adult. I will be adding it to my video library.
B0026WNGBA|5.0|This method works!!!  I can see improvement immediately by just focusing on the posture alignment and my breathing.  I still have much more to learn and looking forward to more improvements.  I run everyday now without any pain.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Everybody needs to watch this movie,people would change there eating habits,I no that this will change the way I buy food and support the local farmer....
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for the next one!  Am totally addicted.  When does it come out?  I want to get it the same day.
B00957T6X6|5.0|My husband and I fell in love with the show and I decided to purchase the books just for fun. I think they are even better. There is so much more detail and background information with the books it has made it more fun to watch the show now. I have enjoyed the writing style and find it to be a very easy read, almost impossible to put down! Worth the purchase for sure.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Best 007 yet. The movie has character development seldom seen in a Bond movie. Seeing the old Aston Martin was great.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Love it!  A bit steamier than expected and I'm not sure how historically accurate this is but I do enjoy the series.  Looking forward to all the seasons.
B00BI745AA|3.0|If you've read the book or seen the stage version, you'll be disappointed. At least the stage version had people with great voices.
B006LSZECO|3.0|started off slow....then I couldn't put it down!!...so intriguing....then the ending really sucked!!.....its like the author said....&#34;I'm tired of writing this book...so I will just end it now&#34;....I wouldn't read any more of her books unless I was really desperate for something to read....
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Perhaps I would have liked this movie more if I'd seen it in the theater.  However, I found with a few distractions around my house - the movie was a bit difficult to follow.  I do think DD Lewis and Sally Field did a fantastic job with the roles.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|poorly written and I didn't like the message it was sending to our youth.....I didn't even read past the middle (and its not like I'm a &#34;fuddy-duddy&#34;....I sell sex toys as part of my business)..
B0050CQY1W|5.0|This album is good and it part of my collection as you know her voice is great and the songs are special.

B00BUCW54Q|4.0|When they made the first Bond film, Ian Fleming wanted David Niven to play Bond. When he saw Sean Connery he called him a 'mumbling truck driver.' After Dr. No became a success, Ian had no problem with Connery. I only mention this so many people took umbrage over the casting of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.<br /><br />That said, Jack Reacher is a damn good thriller. The production notes tell us Jack Reacher was filmed on 35 mm anamorphic format. In other words, old-school. No digital. No projection screens. The film has an early 70s vibe throughout and it's not hard to imagine Clint Eastwood or Steve McQueen playing this role had it been around. Cruise ratchets his performance up to an eleven (as usual). The music is filled with nobility and the direction leaves you with no doubt you're watching a western played out in modern times. I liked the fact the film is devoid of the rapid-fire digital editing we've come to associate with the genre. I hesitate to call it an action film. Jack Reacher is more of a steady-paced thriller. I read a review somewhere that said most films today go to great lengths to hide the fact the actor is not doing his stunts but not Jack Reacher. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the car chase where the camera zooms into the car several times to show us that yes indeed, that is Tom Cruise doing his own stunts.<br /><br />Another thing worth mentioning is the character of Reacher is completely unsentimental and never second-guesses himself. As much as I enjoyed 'Skyfall,' it's refreshing to see a character who's not wracked with guilt. The next Bond film will have Bond on a therapist's couch. Seriously, Reacher is blunt, direct and remorseless. It's refreshing.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is well worth an evening's viewing.<br /><br />I hope they do Bad Luck and Trouble next. Here's my fantasy casting;<br /><br />Calvin Franz: Ed Norton. (What a great cameo.)<br />Frances Neagley: Jennifer Garner.<br />Stan Lowrey: Ben Affleck.<br />Dave O'Donnell: Brad Pitt.<br />Karla Dixon: No clue. Maybe Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />After that, do 61 Hours and so on.<br /><br />That's just my two cents.<br /><br />David Feeney, Author, [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]l: Brad Pitt.<br />Karla Dixon: No clue.

B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Can I say I hated it 100 times!!!!  It was so far from even being even ok, this was a waist of film, time and effort.  I'm very disappointed in Bruce Willis to even agree to such a stupid movie. All I could think about was pressing Esc on my laptop and asking for a refund for abuse my mind suffered from watching this crap!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The action and drama are intense and intriguing. The Tudors is a great way to imagine history. Most enjoyable. Looking forward to viewing the other seasons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surf because it is pretty realistic and it is WAY better than temple run! I love it!!
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|Really good book.<br />Plenty of good examples and anecdotes, liked the links to other Ted speakers.<br />This book gives more than just the basic how to be a good presenter book that are available
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I expected to see a better story line from the previews. The acting was fantastic, but how sad that they did not have a good script. It was a waste of their time and talents.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|As usual, Michael Connelly writes so well.  It is easy to really get involved in his books.  I've read many of his books and never been disappointed.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I have always loved this movie; it is a good movie for the family to enjoy. anyone would love this movie
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This remains the finest series on TV today.  Superb writing, casting, acting, and costume design.  High production values.  Highly recommended!
140053271X|1.0|It was very difficult to try and make it work. Could not download and purchase books.<br />Product bought 4/14/13 and tried to return 5/10/13. Claim denied because expiration<br />date passed for return. Wasn't even a month.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|The chemistry between Bradley and Jennifer was awesome. Such a great job. I'll definitely watch it again. Jennifer Lawrence has a bright future.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Fun story line, magical theme and lovable characters... there is nothing to dislike about this film. Powerful message about believing. Fun for all ages and you walk away maybe just beliving a little bit more.
B00CM96A60|5.0|I have played every possible type of music, from country legend Dolly P to modern crooner Michael Bolton, from John Tesh's contemporary masterpiece at Red Rocks to the hipsters of Nickleback and Creed. I even blew out one of the two speakers on my Asus laptop playing Billy Ray Cyrus last Fall.  Still, I couldn't lure Darla into even stopping by my motel door.  That is until I started cranking AVB's Intense.  I had a feeling she'd go for the super electronic beaty stuff and I was right.<br /><br />I had been looping the entire Intense album but Randy, the motel super, said my room sounded like a leathery German disco club.  Apparently, Randy doesn't like techno.  But he agreed that I could loop the four best tracks -- Intense, This is What it Feels Like, Sound of the Drums and Alone -- and I played them all last weekend.<br /><br />The first few times Darla walked by on her way to the dumpster (twice too for the bus stop) she just ignored me.  But the sixth time she stopped and listened for a second.  Later that night, I heard her slump down outside my door.  She had been crying and drinking again.  I know she came for the music. . . and for the man playing it.  Just then \\"Alone\\" was playing.  But she was no longer alone.  Nor was I.  We were at last together.  I kissed her on her rippled cheek.  I thought she would wake up, look me in the eyes and we would have our moment.  But then Darla's son Donnie comes stomping out of their room with her scooter chair.  He's a big boy and manages to get her onto the scooter and pushes her home.<br /><br />While Darla never opened her eyes, AVB brought us together.  It's been 27 months of flirting (one-way) and pining.  AVB finally sealed the deal.  The first kiss.<br /><br />Will she even remember?  How can she not.  I'm playing AVB forever.<br /><br />The music is quite exceptional.  The collaborations are well considered and diverse.  Take a chance on Armin van Buuren and just maybe, just maybe love will take a chance on youtoo.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I just loved this book.. it is a tad different from the book, but it was really moving and sweet. Highly Recommended.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|There is essentially only one thing wrong with this movie and that is that it is ridiculously long. I think they took what should have been two 120-minute movies and stretched it out into three 180-minute movies in order to make more money. If this formula were applied to the LOTR trilogy, we would have gotten nine movies for a total of 27+ hours of film. Because of this, The Hobbit is painfully slow and repetitive. With a few simple edits, this movie easily could have ended at the two hour mark while maintaining the integrity of the story.<br /><br />That said, if you are a Tolkien fanatic, I would guess you would be fine with all this--which is all that matters.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|Very funny and very real.. I was not surprised to hear Barbara drop the F bomb.  She is a fantastic actress.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|If you liked the previous Bourne movies you will like this one also.<br />Plenty of action!  Mind stimulating!<br />Will definitely watch it again.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is nice to step back in time and escape to simpler times!  The cast and characters keep your attention and make you want to see more of their story.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I gave it 4 stars cause it should have been longer. Other than that it is a fun game to play.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|ADWD is a great book.  The Ice and Fire series is well worth the time for those who are not easily offended.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!<br /><br /> I walked into the theatre the day after the premier with confidence that Shane Black and staff would have had no problem whatsoever in creating an epic kickoff for phase two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Since Iron Man 2 was a little disappointing and steered astray of the Extremis plot, I just knew this story would get Iron Man back on track, and couldn't help but be greatness with such a clever cast and such valuable characters to the storyline. The plot started out somewhat rocky, but I was indulged at the introduction of Maya Hansen, being as the \\"Extremis\\" plot is my favorite in all Iron Man history. Although I really don't care much for the original Extremis plot to be toyed with, I kind of liked the idea of creating a villain out of Aldrich Killian, since his story in the comics was a waste of character; like they got rid of someone they really didn't have time or room enough to keep in the mix. It was inevitable that he would be a villain in the film as Tony emphasizes in his narration about \\"creating monsters\\", and deliberately leaves Aldrich waiting on the rooftops during the New Years Millennium party. But, like I said, I'm fine with all that; I wouldn't want the motion picture to completely duplicate the comics or Joss Whedon's animated version, and I actually liked how they spiced up the extremis virus. It was looking good. The Mandarin made his appearance and Tony gets pissed. Action rocks in..... then, after that, everything goes WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!<br /><br /> First off, Marvel has had a grasp on the best comic book motion picture franchise and running continuity since the first Iron Man. Why would you cast one of the best actors anyone could ever think to play one of the most iconic villains in Marvel comics, and then screw it up so bad that I have almost completely lost faith in the entire phase two conundrum? I mean it's Ben Freaking Kingsley for Christ's sake!! It could have been monumental. I cant' believehe was on board for such a butchering. They had so much potential for villains in this movie. I mean, making the Mandarin a spoof!!! What are you thinking?!?! That's like taking Joker away from Batman, Green Goblin away from Spiderman, General Zod away from Superman. It's an insult to Marvel fans, and especially to the original comic book writers and artists, and it makes this whole film just silly.<br /><br /> Secondly, why would you hire someone who's greatest accomplishments are cliché action blow 'em up, beat 'em up, bland scripted bullcrap, to direct and write a screenplay that was suppose to tell such a wonderful story? It is beyond me that such a successful franchise devolved into a Michael Bay/Chris Nolanesque script for what should have been a very important piece of the pie. I almost threw up putting those two names together in order to reference a film, but it makes since if you'll let me explain. I understand that Nolan did wonderful things with the story of not only Batman, but especially Bruce Wayne. I loved The Dark Knight Trilogy, no doubt. I felt like Black was making some kind of crude, twisted, corny, failed attempt at a similar story this go around with Tony Stark. We all love Tony, but we already have enough Tony. We love him. We know his background, his story, his don't give a damn attitude. We know Tony. We know he's not a sissy, whiny, pansy who has anxiety attacks because of a battle he experienced with the Avengers. Tony Stark is a bad @$$, not some blabbering crybaby. He's the one who uses wit, incredible genius, ingenuity, an invincible suit of weapon filled armor powered by a core that defines bad @$$ery, and an inability to back down from any adversary to be the fearless leader of elite superheroes, Nobody raises their tails off the edge of their seats anymore than when Iron Man fans see Stark suit up and kick into action. The script is crap. It's like Black wrote most of it trying to imitate Michael Bay's excuse for comedy. It's repulse. The action sequences and plot holes are hideous as well. The climax battle is pretty good, if you can stomach getting that far into the movie. All these are traits of Bay, who is a buffoon (in case you didn't know).<br /><br /> Thirdly, why the heck did they make the MK 42 (new compact \\"suitcase\\") armor so malfunctioned? Stark is a genius. He creates things that work. Other than that he has forty-something other suits that work perfectly well that he could have easily used at anytime.... including Iron Patriot, which Rhodes barely even wears, and which is stolen from another Marvel comic book storyline in which Norman Osborn dons the name and armor. Also, I literally got sick and tired of seeing Iron Man armor explode in this movie. That ain't cool when your entire life you've considered Iron Man's armor virtually indestructible.<br /><br /> Fourthly, in the end Stark has no home and no armor. He destroys every last suit before riding off and proclaiming \\" I am Iron Man.\\" Not a great way to blend story arcs with the next Avengers movie, and definitely something Tony would never do. You would think since Black put so much emphasis on getting to \\"know\\" Tony Stark, he would've knew better than end things in such a mess. I also noticed in the end credits a special thanks to Joss Whedon. I really don't expect he had a hand in writing such blasphemy. I'm sure he offered sound advice. They should have taken it if they were going to thank him for it.<br /><br /> Lastly, after the end credits we get the bonus scene just as all the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films supply. It reminded me how infuriated I am that Marvel decided not to cast Edward Norton for the remaining run of films including last year's Avengers. He was the best Bruce Banner ever, and done a superb job in writing for the film The Incredible Hulk. I Don't think Ruffalo done a bad job or anything, and this really didn't have any effect on my opinion of Iron Man 3, I just felt the need to share myfrustration about the matter.<br /><br /> Overall, almost everything about this film blows. I gave the film 2 stars. Those stars belong to the actors who done a magnificent job with a crappy screenplay. The writers ruined the Mandarin, ruined Iron Man, and ruined my hopes for a great Extremis trilogy. They crippled the series with Iron Man 2, but this was the final devastating blow.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Yet another great book by R.A. Salvatore.  This series is highly recommended, which is why I have read it multiple times in my life.  The older I get, the more I get out of the series.

Otherwise, why am I up at 2:30 am completing the last episode of Season 2?<br /><br />But who would have known that these fine Englishmen and women actually can display emotion.

B0043JDUNS|5.0|I always hate when main characters get switched with other actors. I really like Rhodes in the last movie... but this one wasn't that bad. The movie was exciting & funny, a pleasure to watch. I can't wait to go see Iron Man 3 now!

B004A8ZWWO|3.0|Not going to lie - when I first saw this trailer I was like, \\"Nope. Don't wanna see it. I'm not feeling Eddie Murphy's role in this one.\\" Then it came to theater - STILL didn't see it - came to DVD...STILL didn't see it - then it came to Netflix...sooooooo I gave it a chance. Final verdict...<br /><br />I liked it. Great cast. It was like OCEAN'S ELEVEN but without the cool stuff. TOWER HEIST had great comedic performances from everyone. It was good to see Ben Stiller in more of a serious role. (lol) Eddie Murphy - - he ended up being cool. (lol)
B000FC0V3E|3.0|Hemingway writes an interesting story of a woman who can't quite commit to the man she is engaged to. Lady Ashley is a divorced woman who falls for almost every man she meets this leaves her confused. How ever she some how remains loyal to her man Mike Campell. In the end she will learn lesson.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is a story about love and loss, cruelty and triumph of the human spirit, humanity and the richness of human connection.  I have read all the winners of the Pulitzer prize for fiction and this is an eminently deserving addition to that group.
B0000029GA|5.0|Was buying Life Is Good, and thought to myself: \\"why do I still not have Illmatic?\\" So of course I bought it, it's a no brainer - and not one of those things you have to think twice about.<br />Timeless album
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Everything we love about Scribblenauts, but on Android.  The controls could use refinement...despite this being an iPad port, the controls feel like they were designed around the DS's stylus.  Unless you utilize zoom heavily, it's hard to achieve the precision the game seems to need with a fingertip.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I liked the book and the movie. I am a Matthew McConaughey fan and he did not disappoint. I liked the story
B0076DELIG|5.0|A great Harry Bosch novel although I suspected the plot twist. I wondered how it could end was surprised.<br />Enjoyable.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|When I first downloaded it, it worked fine.  Now I cannot access it.  Don't know what happened.  Would love to be able to play it again.
B00AAKZPUK|3.0|This was recommended to me by an older friend as one of the first spy thriller movies.  It has good suspense, romance, and action.  A little simple in the conspiracy theory, don't trust the government, sort of plot lines; compared to today's standards.  But, still enjoyable to watch.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|My daughter loved this present and is enjoying listening to it regularly.<br />Typical Michael Buble, good CD and worth the money for this gift.

B0077EBWVI|3.0|It was only okay.  Nothing beats the original !!!  I kept losing the picture and had to resume a lot.  Younger folks will enjoy
B008602KQI|5.0|Jennifer is perfect in this film.  And I love the biting social commentary.  Check out Jennifer's SNL skit about THE HUNGER GAMES.
193700788X|5.0|I love, love Eric and if I was in a place where Sookie is. In a heart beat I would chose to be turned just to be with him. But I'm not Sookie and Sookie has never wanted to be a vampire. She loves the sun, the day and wants to have children. None of those will she ever have being with Eric. These books have always been about Sookie. The readers need to take her into consideration. Realize the life that Sookie has always wanted. Does not include vamps. She loves Eric but there just isn't a HEA for her with him. God Eric has by my driving force through these books for so long and I am so committed to him. But maybe he always has craved power over love. That's why he is where he is. I wish we could move forward two hundreds years after the contract I.s up and see the love that Eric still has for her and realize the mistakes he made and the woman he pasted up, but could never get over. Eric does truly love Sookie. It make me sad that they won't get to explore that.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This is a great movie.  Bought it as a gift for a friend.  They will love it to. Thank you.
B005K0S2SW|5.0|I've been missing the sound of horns in music since the 70s...and this more than fills the bill.  Lots of energy, great horns, and improv, great tunes.  For True is a fun mix of Funk/Rock/Orleans music.  If that mix of genres interests you, buy this record.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|It has everything. Adventure, romance, war, medicine. Mixing old world and new world, different periods of time. Honestly one of the best series I have read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story is not what you think based on the hype. A great love story & nice that love can conquer all. Well worth the read.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's really great and you have to read the whole series. I think this book is probably the best of the series otherwise catching fire is the second.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is the most fun game that I have played in a while. I love all the suits and everything, but I can't unlock Mark 42, but don't get me wrong, I love heartbreaker.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was educational for me as well as an emotional experience.  I never understood what happens in a tsunami until watching this true story.  The acting was superb, and the movie was very realistically done.  There are a couple of parts where they show the mothers breast.  If you are like me, I like to know about any nudity/inappropriate content beforehand.  While I feel that all nudity is unnecessary, I still recommend this movie due the setting surrounding the exposure.  Just be aware that it is there.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game.I love it.It is one of the best games I ever played.I play it every day
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Very intriguing & very exciting. Suspenseful,  full of dramatically action packed .Full of highs & lows , but less gadgets. A conclusion well needed to start a new adventure with a new horizon!
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I enjoyed reading this simple to understand and well organized book. I feel like the ideas and strategies presented were done so in a clear and simple way. A good read with a lot of solid advice.
B005LAIISA|2.0|I thought this movie was over-acted and not even remotely believable.It was not fun like the previous films were.I didn't enjoy it because it seemed to be geared to teenagersmore than anyone else..
B00683JLXA|5.0|Husband selected this game and we both have throughly enjoyed it.  We are goint to definately recommend it to our friends.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Took a while to become interesting .I felt the part of the dwarf king was over-acted;he came across as too angry all the time.Also,the lighting of the movie was too dark.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is not just all girly it is for anyone who wants a good game to teach their kid how to take care of pets with awsome graphics (well if you have kindle fire hd) great game Hasbro&trade;
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Everything was excellant;the color and clarity,the content and story line was perfect.This movie should most definitly become a Christmas holiday classic.

B00B0NDF26|4.0|A little more of a pop flavor than their earlier albums and not quite as good in my opinion but still has some catchy tunes.
B009NY43NY|1.0|SPOILERS ABOUND.... BEWARE!<br /><br />Although after book 12, I totally expected what happened in this book... I was still disappointed. CH's writing style has deteriorated to telgraphingevery single surprise. Sookie has become a cussing shadow of herself, Eric has become a do-nothing subservient and embarrassingly absent vampire... this is the SOUTHERN VAMPIRE MYSTERIES...is it not? No real scenes of Pam, Eric or Fangtasia... Bill was very peripheral as well, and who the hell asked for Karin?<br /><br />Sam strikes a bargain with Eric that is ridiculous... he's barely a man who would .... no less a Supe who would cowtow to Eric like that...<br /><br />Not one character behaves as he ought, perhaps with the exceptin of Steve Newlin and John Glassport. (Which btw was convoluted and stupid!! Claude! Stupid! Sookie has other beings ... FREYDA anyone, Felipe, anyone? who want her dead... and then Eric would have saved her or worked with her ...oh and PAM!) I liked bringing Amelia, Bob, Barry, Dianatha and Mr. C back into the story... that was a good part. Killing Arlene was excellent - but why didn't FREYDA, Queen of Oklahoma do it??? Then frame Sookie... what a wonderful book that would have been - much more difficult to prove to the living authorities and much harder to get rid of the queen...especially because Eric was TORN.<br /><br />I get Sookie's yearning to be a mom - it was slammed at us constantly - Tara's twins, Amelia's surprising precnancy... but coouldn't she be artificially inseminated and still be Eric's wife???<br /><br />Oy.<br /><br />Anyway can I give something less than one star? Gonna try.(less)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I am an animal lover....This is the most heartwrenching movie I ever saw.  I'm going to wear the disc out if I don't stop watching it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Realistic view into mental illness and the effects on family and other relationships. But it has an uplifting message and that is to find the silver lining in whatever life hands you or if life hands you lemons, make lemonade! All the acting was superb. Good chemistry among them all. A gem!
B00BESLHEA|4.0|Its a pretty fun movie. I like that they go old school with the cheesy special effects. Plot is fine but its the old kung fu style fighting with the modern graphics i enjoyed the most. This is a great movie for old school martial arts fans.
0425220931|5.0|This is a story about one man's musical journey. It is not a typical lesson book. It is about searching for music in oneself, in nature, in others, etc. I found the main character's experiences/lessons while searching for music to be entertaining and profound. The lessons ultimately lead him to the discovery of Music's living spirit.<br /><br />It reminds me of an old music professor I had. He said, \\"When you go to the symphony there is only one musician in the orchestra, the conductor, all those other people are simply technicians.\\"
193700788X|1.0|Don't waste your money, this book is a devastation, but not only that it is poorly written by an author who was on a power trip, trying to let everyone know that she had all the control, even though she gave us these charectors, and in writing this book decided to not take any of the fans into consideration.  I have been a long fan of this series and enjoyed and loved everyone of  them.  I feel so betrayed by this book............
B006LSZECO|4.0|A story that keeps leaping, galloping ahead of you, daring you to predict what happens next. It becomes sick, violent and distasteful. The reader feels caught in a high-octane twisted tale in which everyone is sick as a dog.<br />I must say, Gillian Flynn must be one sick bitch. As well as brilliant.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|No one can make any sense out of this thing!!! This book is for moons!!!! I @#/¡ this stupid thing!!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Very original story, surprising ending. The structure of the story is told in flashback and and the present, which is an interesting technique.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.
B00190N4E4|5.0|An excellent documentary, reflecting values we are missing in our daily life.<br />a little bit long but worth the view
B00BSWMITK|3.0|I like a few songs on this album but overall, it's not doing it for me.  I do not like the production on this release.  I just listened to \\"Joe Satriani\\", released in 1995, and produced by Glyn Johns.  Way better!!!
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|Rod out did himself with this one! The best one he has done in a long, long time. All written by himself, it's almost Ike an auto biography in music! You won't be sorry you bought this one! It's a keeper!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Its Downtown Abbey.  What more needs to be said.  Its the best thing to come out of PBS in years!  Watch every episode!!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I am a fan of the T.V. series &#34;Bones&#34; and enjoy the characters including Temperance.  The book was enjoyable and the writing was very good and descriptive.  The story got a bit convoluted and became predictable except for all of the inter relations of the character family.  Overall a good book not a great book.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Once you get past the curiosity of the acompanying scandal, this is actually a pretty good movie.  Recommended for any fan of the genre.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved it!  The characters are so believable.  Having always been interested in history, I really enjoyed the storyline revolves around true historical events.  It is amazing that such a class system flourished less than 100 years ago! Maggie Smith is hysterical!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Supper addictive game. I recommend this to everyone who loves these kind of games just like me. If there were ten stars I'd give it a ten but there are only five so five stars..
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great mystery solving game, with fun puzzle solving and hidden piece finding objectives. Totally original! I'm only dissapointed that it didn't have like 10 more levels. I would strongly recommend that you give it a try!
B00594XOZU|5.0|My Granddaughter had me out this app on my Fire so I could text her and her mom that is what this app is for if someone else has it too it a great tool for texting easy to use and fun fir a Granny like me.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i wish i had the newest season of this show right now, it sucked to watch the last episode because i new there wouldn't be another episode after it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautiful production!  Fantastic, interesting story line with well-written, nuanced characters.  We look forward to watching each episode and we love the visuals.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|the 3-d on this show was a good time, i bet little kids would like it more than i did. i rented it to see how well the hd would convert to 3-d.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|This movie left us scratching our heads, wondering why it was even in the running for an Academy Award. Not a movie to watch a second time.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|this was a good movie, but i wasn't as good as the rest of them. i was better than most of the movies that have a fourth continuation though.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This trilogy was mind- blowing for me. It was a complete rollercoaster ride.As this raps up the story we get a ending that really fit into the series.Don't pay heed to those who say this book is Crap and doesn't give you an ending.IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!  Thomas loses his friend the family he is closest to but in the end everything goes well.  And remember this while you are reading this book or series: WICKED is good.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great movie. Not for the sensitive or easily grossed out. Definitely worth checking out if you love action, shooters, or westerns.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Each book is better than the first. It is just hot reading.  I haven't been able to put it down.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Needed this app to veiw my course Syllabus and type up assignments. Did the the job for me so I say it works just fine.
193700788X|5.0|The final Sookie Stackhouse book! I felt a whole lot of trepidation going into this book - how would Charlaine Harris wrap up Sookie's long, involved, and complex story?  Who will Sookie end up with?  Can she ever not be in danger?  What about Hunter?  WHO WILL SOOKIE END UP WITH? (Not who I wanted actually but anyways...)  What I found intriguing about this last book was the major set-up in the prologue.  Bad people, Sookie's enemies, were gathering forces it seemed, and it brought a whole lot of foreboding tension already to this story.  And made me even more nervous.  (Is someone major going to die in the end?  Wait, what does \\"Dead Ever After\\" mean?)  But this tension was perfect for what I felt like Charlaine Harris was crafting for Sookie's final book.  It felt like a reckoning of sorts, and I was glad that so many characters from past books made an appearance here, either to show their support or to try and \\"get Sookie\\".  It's a wonderful way to show, that even though Sookie's has had a lot of bad things happen to her in her life, the love and friendship of the good people of Bon Temps balanced that, and Sookie has a lot to be grateful for.  It's an approach to that was very touching to read, and also raises the stakes because there are two separate plans to harm Sookie, and more than one bad guy to fear.<br /><br />As with most of the books in this series, the soap opera-esque life of Sookie dominates the mystery portion, but with the little bit of information dropped in the beginning and the rare flash of insight into what the bad guys are up to, there is a lot of suspense in this story because you know many bad things are going to happen, but you don't know when, or who or why sometimes.  There's a delicious anticipation for the resolution and for more answers and because of that I found this a riveting read.  Of course, I found the way Sookie works through her dilemmas just as inspiring as I find her strong, astute,  and generally positive character.  After reading this book I am again reminded of how much I love her narrative voice and her witty asides.<br /><br />Because I really didn't have too many expectations or hopes for how Sookie's story will end, I felt like Charlaine's ending was perfect and captured everything I have come to love about reading a Sookie Stackhouse novel.  And even though I wanted Sookie to end up with someone else, I think the guy she got is perfect too.  This story moves quickly and gets quite complex with the large cast of characters but I feel it is a wonderful end to a wonderfully entertaining series!er reading this book I am again reminded of how much I love her narrative voice and her witty asides.<br /><br />Because I really didn't have too many expectations or hopes for how Sookie's story will end, I felt like Charlaine's ending was perfect and captured everything I have come to love about reading a Sookie Stackhouse novel.

B009RH9FR6|5.0|The kindle is perfect for me. I love the swivel screen feature. the construction and materials are of very good quality.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|What else can you say. Nathan Fillion is the man!  I've been a fan since Firefly and Serenity. His &#34;rugged handsomeness&#34; and smartass sense of humor is only made more awesome by the character of Richard Castle, a smartass author raised by a has-been actress, single father of a genius daughter, and believer in the unbelievable (apparently at times only to annoy Beckett). Season 5 sees these two stop dancing around each other to begin a romantic relationship as Casket (think Brangelina). A fitting name considering both their professions. I look forward to every episode. Along with CSI and Elementary, Castle is the only show on network television that I watch. Everything else is cable, because I PAY for cable. It takes an awesome show to lure me away from watching something I have to pay for to watch something I get for free! I highly recommend it. And for the avid reader, check out the Richard Castle novels. No idea who wrote them since Castle is fictional, but I think they're pretty decent books for a quick read.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|I have enjoyed the book. You do not need to be an economist or something like that. Easy to read.

B00B73MU6G|5.0|A beautifully written novel about a recently widowed small town  preacher, who with his two young daughters , struggle to come to terms with their loss.  I love it.
B0042XA2U4|4.0|I loved the movie so in the wrong order, I read the book. Generally, books are better than the movie version. In this case I think that they are equally good. I enjoyed the characters in the book and it was easy to empathize with Holly's struggles to cope with life after her husband's death. The story line was easy to follow and the characters were believable.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|Lot of useful info ranging from beginners to pro athlete...very good book! It breaks down the CF methodology very simple and understandable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There were a few twists that were definitely unexpected which is something I love about this book. Looking forward to reading the third book!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I love the Hannibal Lector series by Thomas Harris and I (mostly) loved the movies. When I saw previews for Hannibal the TV show I thought, 'oh no, there is no way NBC will be able to do this story justice.' Holy crap was I wrong! I watched the first episode and was pleasantly surprised that this was not just the story of Hannibal Lector or an inadequate prequel series to the movies, this was a whole new kind of awesome.<br /><br />After the first episode I was not completely hooked. I am a big fan of Anthony Hopkins and I was not sold on Mads Mikkelsen in the role. Now, having watched 6 episodes (including the actual episode 4 which was not aired in the US-- download it from Amazon, it is worth the $1.99) I am completely sold on Mads (I think I realized I loved him after episode 3), he is an amazing actor and is a disturbingly good Hannibal Lector.<br /><br />I also like that characters from the movies continue to be introduced and are sometimes surprising-Freddie Lounds a woman? that is just crazy talk-- its hard to think that Phillip Seymour Hoffman played the same character. At the same time, you don't have to be an avid fan of the movies (or have seen them at all) to enjoy this show.  Because they are reinventing characters and introducing different story lines each episode anyone can get hooked on this show without knowing anything about the Hannibal Lector books or movies.  Sometimes I think having no knowledge of these characters would make this show even better.<br /><br />I don't like that people keep saying that Dexter is ending so we need a new serial killer show.  This show blows Dexter out of the water.  Yes Dexter is a great show, but for the last few seasons it has lost its luster.  This show revolves around serious characters played by a serious cast.  It has rich visuals and, honestly, a creepy tone.  I do think that it may be suited better for cable or even as an original series on Amazon or Netflix. I think that would give it a little more freedom.<br /><br />All that being said, the show continues to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, sometimes it is gory, and most of the time it is quite disturbing, but all of it is so well done. It is not a gore-fest meant to shock and awe, it is all meant to further twist the viewers mind and see deeper into all of the characters--not only Hannibal. The psychology of this show is impressive.  I really hope people tune in and give this show a good run, I have not loved a show like this in, well, ever.m.<br /><br />All that being said, the show continues to keep me on the edge of my seat.

B00BQI4AU6|4.0|Solid Ground is a great song that totally rocks. Solid Ground is just as good as classic Cinderella hits. The rest of the cd isn't nearly as good though.  Maybe 3 or 4 other songs worth checkin out. Buy it for the song Solid Ground and maybe end up liking the rest. A Different Light is my second fav probably.
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|I thought this book was a great start.  I had a limited understanding of CSS. I have been designing web pages only a short time.  I would purchase this book again in a second.  Well written and great example codes.

B000JMKRKC|3.0|Although the prose was lovely, the book trudged along, dodging down this path and that, and only finally began to coalesce toward the end, at which point I couldn't put it down.

B00CDT41RY|4.0|A very typical Tarantino movie, but a great one. I only wish he would stay out of his movies. He always shows up and kind of breaks you out of the movie. Like a huge typo while reading a good book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|For the most part I thought it was a page turner.  I liked the book but did not like the ending.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It's cute - a bit like watching Glee.  You can zone out to this film - which was my intention for renting it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever watched.  You feel like you are there with the characters.... Great Job!
B001VIMCW4|3.0|This movie is nowhere nearly as good as thought it would be. Kurylenko is the only reason to watch a flick like this one..
B003R0LBVW|5.0|Catching story and made me think about a lot of things. Inspiring without being difficult to read. I'll read it again.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Just a simple complicated story. I loved it. I would definitely recommend. It's simply written and the characters are so beautifully flawed.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Love it! I got it just for only the one song Sail! Cuz its different and powerful and now I heard the rest of the songs and they are pretty good as well. But just for the Sail song alone its worth it!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The movie was great, but the book was better. Well written and a fasanating story. I would recommend this to everyone. Great read!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Very good movie.Did not know what sisters go through to become a Nun.Audrey Hepburn was wonderful as she always is.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was a lot better than your run of the mill romantic comedy. This was actually a really good movie...
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this series. I only wish I could watch it on netflix instead of buying the dvd, but totally worth it.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|I honestly have to say I skipped over all the technical stuff about his helicopter training but once I got past that, I enjoyed the book. I would say probably the best I have read so far from a helicopter pilots perspective.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I don't know if it's the movie or the effects I love with this producer.  The movie ends with a possible new movie.  I will look forward to it, if they make it.  I know I would love to go to New Zeland! The landscape is so beautiful!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Thsi is one book that gives me peace of mind......Life is full of ups and downs, one should not give up.
B000UR9T8W|3.0|I thought I was ordering the boxed set as depicted on the screen.  Instead I received the individual movies without the box set.  Movies were fine, but this was very misleading and disappointing as I did not receive what I expected.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Its about time someone came out with some real lyrics enough of the garbage that is rotating on the radio.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|I'm trying to write this so there aren't any spoilers...<br /><br />The 3rd Season of Fringe was good.  Not great... but good.  Every episode just felt like a setup for the following Season 4, so I had to press myself to keep watching even though some of the episodes weren't that good.<br /><br />After Season 2 took a wild direction, I understand why they needed to do Season 3 this way and a lot of things are coming together in Season 4 now.<br /><br />Overall... a good season of Fringe.
B00003CXBK|4.0|My kids really enjoy the films made by Studio Ghibli, and I do to. The animation is superb, and the storytelling is very imaginative. This was one of the last of the Ghibli movies to complete our collection. Grateful that I could locate a new copy through Amazon. If you have kids with a big imagination, and you adults still have one too, get Princess Mononoke along with the other Mayazaki animated films.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|It was pretty funny and actually better science fiction then I expected. I really wish the book was longer though, for the price I think it was a little short.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I saw the on a daily deal & thought &#34;what the heck&#34; and gave it a try. Absolutely loved it! Very fast paced. Quite technical in a few areas, but not so much to be off putting. I will be hunting for more of Andy Weir' s work; it was very funny and well paced.
006198969X|5.0|Purchased this for daughter for Christmas and she loved it.  She loves the tips that this young lady puts into her books.
B00BZOD63S|3.0|Not so much horror besides the regular jump scare. But turns into almost a sci fi esc choice between nature vs nuture. Some stand out performances from the child actors and so so from the adults. An okay movie, wish it had been available for rent instead of full purchase.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Daughter loves this movie.  She says it is very close to what high school really can be these days.  Says it is also very comical.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|All in all, I think AMoL was an excellent finish to the series.  I'm sure most everyone can agree that what started out as one of the best epic stories of all time had somewhat foundered in the later volumes under Jordan.  Not only was I impressed with this final book, but also with the other two books of the series that Sanderson completed.  I think that he brought some conciseness and focus into the meandering WoT series, especially with this epic conclusion.  It was no small fete to bring closure to essentially all of the primary broad ranging story arcs while at the same time composing the action of the Last Battle.<br /><br />Hats off Mr. Sanderson, well played sir.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|It was not too bad.  The relationship was kind of annoying with the back and forth.  The guy was too needy.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like this game since it's Minecraft on the go but in creative you have no animals. There are no pets and no breeding and the world has set limits. I understand the latter but the former being added to the game would make it amazing.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Great book. I could n't put it down. I love the pace in which Archer writes,  The ending just made me want more.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As you read this book, by a man who was there, you will be amazed at the difference between those who were there and those who weren't but want to take credit for Killing Bin Laden.  Some have said the the POTUS made the most gutsy call that any president ever made, NOT!!!!  He was in the saferty of the White House, he sent men on a mission that they could have been killed on, they were the gutsy ones.  Then the VicePOTUS told the world about the men that killed Bin Laden, and put their lives at risk.  In fact many of them were killed not long after he identified the Seal team.  A very interesting book.
034580404X|5.0|This is an excellent series! It has a really good story line filled with sexual tension and release. I highly recommend it and will reread in the future!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love it. My favorite game. It helps to keep my mind active and I enjoy trying to win the stars within the time limit.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Very good movie<br />Foster was brilliant. She definitely delivered. I have always admired her talent.<br />I hope she makes more movies.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|Love this CD! Its not my favorite by Joe, but it is great. If you havent heard him before, you must listen and appreciate this music artist.
0894803123|5.0|It's great to have the recepies of the great Been and Gerry. I was never verry successfull at replicating their Ice cream, but making your own ice cream from fresh cream, whole organic milk, and other fresh items is a real treat. I suggest you get one of the new Ice Cream makers that only makes about two or four servings. It's a real treat.
B00008972S|5.0|Thank you Natalie Wood and the rest of the people involved with producing this movie. I know it is a movie, but everytime I watch it, I am transported to the broadway theatre; in my own living room. Special edition is great! I have the screen play right in my hands with the little booklet that comes with it! Love it!
B009AP2G26|5.0|I loved every number they did laughed cried with them and learned allot over the period of time watching the show, its funny, informing fun easy to watch with kids and wife and grand kids also, one added feature is when we go out to  a night club, over the four years I know about every song played by local bands, it has really opened up my range of music I love and like, thanks
B0000AKCLS|5.0|If you want blues, you got it with this production. Joe does his best to be ranked as one of Blues Music's best. This younger artist definitely carries the soul of the blues legends.
B009EE4K86|4.0|Awesome cast. Great effects. Good story even if you haven't seen the other series. Would definitely recommend checking it out.
B009YBTZ8O|4.0|This is a great children's fantasy novel, that has a sweet story and leaves you with a warm happy feeling
B001DUDKEY|4.0|I personally prefer the most recent version of this Jane austen classic. However this production still contains the elements that keep you wondering what the fate of its main characters might be.
B006G2124E|5.0|The actors were incredible and makes me feel like I was involved in the story and wanted to be able to help
B002P73UQW|5.0|I love the show I never miss it The guys on the show are great and it keeps me happy all day
1444737104|5.0|I loved this book and recommend it. It is a very inspirational story. I'm proud of James Bowen and wish him a wonderful future.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Middle aged with our own limited energy, seriously ill parents including a mother with Alzheimer's literally drowning in hoarded treasures, this is exactly what my husband and I needed to liberate us from more stress that, in fact, we had control over.  We've accomplished a lot just in one week and will be a lifesaver when dealing with estate matters soon.  We want the remaining years of our lives to be less stressful and not shackled to clutter and misplaced values. Though probably not for everyone, this approach will help us accomplish our goals.  I'm starting in on her next two books to help me complete this journey started as I find her a very practical map maker in addition to being truly motivational.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great film. I highly recommend this. Very graphic, not for children. I think it makes the case against torture. See it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it!  Read everyday! I use it for work and pleasure, night and day.  Would highly recommend to any one.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I know that no book can always meet hyped expectations but I feel like this one just missed the mark.  She tried too wrap things up too neatly.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|This case is great to zip up your kindle in.  Looks nice, easy to bring around to places, and is pretty thin.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|It is one of the greatest books I ever read. It is well  researched, andd I believe everybody should read it. It is the most informative book on  societies and it helps you understand our  world beynd the USA. Thanks Marion V. Anker
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I really liked this app it was a great file manger one the best actually, until I updated my old ES Explorer for the newer version and all of sudden it won't let me open my videos and crashes the second I try to open one. Please fix this or some one tell me if it's possible to go back to the older one.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I  found Kathy Reichs a long time before TV found her.<br />Of course, I like the books better. I like all of her detailed<br />explanations of what she does and her conclusions etc.<br />Some people may have difficulty with the autopsies and exams,but<br />it is the basis for the books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It was cool good graphics had a lot of fun on it I would suggest it to a 3-7 grade limit though
B00CL68BK2|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie, great acting, great story, and if you have heard of bipolar disorder but don't know what it is, you will after you watch this movie.  Buts it not about the disorder, its about living life on life's terms.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|Kept dropping off line and had to back out and restart the movie.  Seems like good movie but issue's with loading movie caused rating.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|THE AVENGERS is a really good movie from the MARVEL heroes.....If you like IRON MAN, HULK and THOR you will like this great adventure!!!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my Kindle so much I can't imagine having a different system and I wouldn't dream of leaving home without it.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|LORD OF THE RINGS is one of the best sagas of ALL TIME!!!!! It´s really a magic movie with AMAZING scenes and a great story!!!! If you already seem this movies, you know that is great....If you never seem LORD OF THE RINGS, do yourself a favour and check this wonderful magic adventure!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The first book was great, the second mediocre, the third?  Well, I advise you to quit the series before you open this one.  It is mainly about the girl trying to decide who to marry.  I get the impression the author did not even decide until she finished writing.
B004G606K8|4.0|Characters are likeable and the storey line is good.  It get you hooked and is believable a great escape into the realm!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I got the Marware Vibe Standing Case in purple. I find it sturdy and attractive. The Kindle Fire HD 7 just snaps into it so easily. And it stays in place well.  I like the fact the the unit is not totally encased. When you stand the unit up in the case, the back of it is open at the bottom ( although snapped securely in place in the brace part of the cover). This allows the unit to get some air and keeps the unit cooler when in operation for a long time.  The Kindle Fire HD 7 can stand up at many angles and stays put, no sliding around or falling flat.  That I really enjoy for viewing videos.  The hard sides give it a study and secure feel. Please with my purchase.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Even with the nastiest of subject matter, Quentin Tarantino makes fun movies! I thought it was hilarious at the end the way they showed Django kissing his wife in a shadow, the way Tarantino mimicked the old westerns was very enjoyable.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I just couldn't stop watching this series.  23 shows.  I ate them like a box of chocolates. No commercials! Yes!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great movie love the bat man movies can wait to see what happens next who will play him and will he become any darker
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved it.......shared it with others and they all loved it. Kept my interest the whole time. Easy read and well written.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I loved this book.  This is a must read for anyone in business ... or otherwise managing people.  It clearly articulates the issues with great case studies to make it's point.  I would highly recommend this and have given it as a gift to several friends.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I have to say, this show is well written, the actors are great and the plot of the show keeps adding more and more with every episode.
B00354YA2M|5.0|Anyone interested in Australia should read this book. Anyone from there should also read this book. In fact, everyone should read this book, period.  If you want an explanation why, let it suffice to say that it is quite impossible not to become interested in and not to decide on visiting Australia after having read it.<br />&#34;Down Under&#34; is Bryson at his best: informative without drowning you in detail, funny without trying too hard, readable without being facile or didactic.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|If you really like to keep up with your reading, this app is for you. It gives you access to your whole Kindle library, no matter where you are. And if you were reading your book one of your other Kindle readers, you will instantly be taken to the farthest point in the chapter you were last reading. Sometimes I forget to take my Kindle with me, but this Android app allows me to keep up with my reading.
B0094M2ITG|4.0|This movie reminded me of my Grandpa because he constantly used stories/lessons/sayings to teach his children and grandchildren about life. It also made me think about my own relationship with my dad. I can relate to the character that plays the son in this movie when he says he doesn't really know his dad because of the constant story-telling. Yet, I can also relate to the dad who knows no other way to be.
0812993845|4.0|Well what can I say that hasn't already been said by the other 108 reviews?  If you've read one Sophie Kinsella book you've basically read them all (including but not limited to the Shopaholic series), they're pretty much junk food for your brain.  I doubt there will ever be a CliffNotes for Shopaholic.  Anyway, Wedding Night doesn't deviate from this pattern and follows a couple who gets married on a whim and goes through disaster after disaster on their honeymoon, unaware that the reason for said disasters is because the sister of the wife is doing everything in her power to prevent them from sealing the deal, so to speak.  Your imagine can probably take it from here as to what hijinks they get into trying to find privacy.<br /><br />The book is told from the alternating perspectives of the woman who got married (Lottie) and the sister (Fliss), so if you get too tired of one you can just hang on for a few pages and they will switch (but they both basically sound the same anyway).<br /><br />Certainly not the worst book I've ever read, but nothing you'll put down and go \\"hmm, that really makes me think!\\"  If books are food, Sophie Kinsella is Ruffles - not good for you, not healthy, but sometimes you just need your fix.<br /><br />PS. Who names their character Fliss?  Autocorrect keeps trying to change it to floss and for once I agree.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I liked the book so much I couldn't wait for the movie. I know that books are almost always better. But I have to say, I was so impressed by the cast in this movie. Every single person was so believable in the role they played. The only other person who could have played Darcy would have been Cameron Diaz, but I found Kate Hudson to be all too real in her role of the totally self absorbed yet likable character. I've always been a Steve Howie fan, Ginnifer Goodwin was believable and she didn't have that annoying short hair that everyone is raving about. Colin, the leading man, also very realistic in this role and I had never seen John Krasinski in anything before. I became a fan of his after the movie. But the story was good, the movie was funny, romantic and my husband actually sat through the whole thing with me saying, &#34;this one was not as predictable as those Meg Ryan movies you try to make me watch.&#34;
193700788X|1.0|As a fan of the SVM series, I was disappointed by the final book. It does not seem to be up to the standards of the earlier books. There are problems with the pacing, the plot and character development (or lack thereof). For a short book, it there was lots of filler about food, shopping and babies. To be fair, it was  briefly peppered with rushed confrontations and action. The main character seemed blown about like a ping pong ball in a wind tunnel and not like a strong, proactive woman. If this were in the middle of the series, I would have written it off and hoped the next one would get better. Although I admire CH as a author (and wish her all the personal health and happiness one could have), I felt let down because I had expected so much better from her. I recommend borrowing it from the library if you are a fan of the series, and passing on this book if you are not.
B00499NHLC|5.0|a great duo for this new series...wish there were more episodes but PBS here in America..I guess...doesn't want to get more????
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I don't typically care for books in funny writing styles (this one is a collection of pen pal letters), but I quickly got over that and the story flowed well. It was very short. Only took a couple of hours to read.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|whats not to like about the return of Dr Who...thanks england for bringing it back to you guys and Whovians in America
B0089LOG02|5.0|loved the historical parts mixing with modern day.  however, thought the story line would continue a little farther.  seems it ended without everything being told.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|well written and acted. quality plots with subplots that give descent twists to the story line. will continue to watch.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I've read every &#34;Bones&#34; book and look forward to a new one.  This was a good read and a good story.  If it had been another author, or a new author, I probably would have rated it higher. However, even though a good book, it just didn't seem up to the expected level of a Reichs' book. Temperance didn't seem to be at the top of her game, if you know what I mean.  Some things just seemed too contrived and only there in order to move the story along or fill in a hole. Not a total disappointment, but not the best of the series.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you love dogs, if you like racing, (or if you love anyone who likes racing), if you have children, if you like stories about vindictive in-laws, if you believe in Karma and nice guys finishing first,or if you just want a book to take over your life for the two days it takes to finish this story...read this book.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love watching this movie.  I watch it over and over.  It is very well done and it is very entertaining.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I love everything about Mad Men!  I have been a faithful watcher of this show since the first season and I am  never disappointed.  I just want more.  Enjoy!
B004XVMCMQ|4.0|I enjoy watching this movie.  I have watched it several times already.  It is very well done. Not necessarily one of my favorite jane austens but adequate.
B0064MPXFA|2.0|I thought I would love this hit tv show.  I watched the first episode and didn't go any further.  A snore.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I enjoy listening to this album.  At first some of the songs were not really appealing, but the more I listened the more they grew on me.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|How can you not love this!?  This movie shines in every way from the all star cast to the music to the costumes.  It's all good!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|One of Blake's best yet.  Every song is it's own story.  He is truly a great entertainer.  The Voice is another side of him too.  Would definitely recommend this.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Very touching true story of  an impoverished family living in America and Ireland in the 1930's.  I also watched the movie and enjoyed that as well.
1616550414|5.0|It is behind the scenes stuff and it has everything you would like and would top off any Zelda fans collection
B003VANOFY|5.0|[Recently Updated]<br />Pros:<br />1) Good Surround Sound<br />2) Comfortable<br />3) Buttons are compatible with almost everything, including Spotify and many media players, which is a big plus.<br />4) They are a decently rugged build.. I've dropped this thing a few times and it held up quite well... No scratches or dings... The coating over the plastic, or the material they use, is fantastic at keeping them clean and durable.<br />5) Good software that is easy to navigate.<br />6) It has a built-in mic-mute button on the left ear button control panel which comes in handy when you need to run off and do something real quick (like get a soda) but don't want to interrupt your friends' voice communications..<br />7) It has a set of Voice-Changers that are really fun to mess around with, and prank friends..<br />8) I've never messed with them, but, it has adjustable Treble and Bass slide meters (in the software).<br />9) The volume roller adjusts the over-all computer volume.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) You have to go into the Gaming Software by Logitech and change the Microphone to 100% transmitting power, and lower the Sidetone to about the 3rd bar, so there is no constant buzzing of background noise in your ear, being picked up by the mic...<br />2) If you are a fair distance away (downstairs for me) and next to a microwave, heating up your last meal, then the headset will get interference and cut out...<br />3) The last one I had (before re-writing this review with a free Logitech replacement via warranty) required a return due to a bad internal charging port connection, after a year and a half of ownership.<br /><br />I've recommended these headsets to at least 3 friends, all of whom bought one and loved it...
B008IJTFYW|4.0|My only complaint is that a couple sounds (thunder in particular) are too quiet to be heard well.  I have tried these solo as well as paired with other sounds.
B007THA4FI|1.0|First, I found the story line fractious, and difficult without a central narrator. And second, every person lacked any redempted qualities except the dead guy, and in the ending was just as unsatisfying. I felt like someone asked Rowling to try an adult book and was obligated but not committed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to reading the next in this series. Well worth your time!
B0053O89IS|5.0|thankyou
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|Enjoyed listening to the songs, brought back a lot of memories.  He is great at singing and composing, the choice of songs on this CD is very good.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|thank you
B008FWHGYS|5.0|Loved all the actors and the story line was integrated geniously. It shows the weakness yet fragility of human beings and how when they give in to their temptations how the consequences effect their lives and all around them.
B000IYU9HW|5.0|thank you
B003XMKN40|5.0|Great purchase!!! Shows the talent of EACH artist! Eric Clapton fans must have!!! Two discs of some really good good music, variety and a good outdoor feeling to this concert.
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|Captivated and got me pumped as an entrance/warm up song (Enter Sandman) in middle school wrestling, and is still their best album in my opinion!
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This movie is a must see for everyone! It is such a healthy representation of how we can truly love each other!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters are well written and engaging. You will not be able to stop. You will need to find out what happens. Buy it.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Kids love cars and cars movie, what else can I say. My son was very excited to start watching once it arrived.
B0095P31L6|2.0|Predictable, not engaging plot that was incredibly slow. We were able to stop and start it over the course of 2 days because it didn't pull you in at all. Looked forward to it being over.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great season. So much happens, so much joy and sadness. The actors are so well suited for their roles. Even when new characters are introduced you immediately find a place for them in your heart.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|1 star is being to nice. Worst books I ever read. E. L. James should of stuck to being a stay at home mom with her soap operas!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|because it gave me the opportunity to be able to watch the first season in its entirety.  I enjoyed getting to meet the characters from the very beginning as opposed to jumping in mid-season.  I'm sorry to hear that the show will no longer be airing after only 5 seasons.  I've grown to love the character Walter Bishop played by John Noble.  I can hardly wait to go on to Season 2!
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|Loved all 8 seasons.  Hard to put down.  Can't wait to watch each episode.  I sure am going to miss Jack and his latest story line.  Love, love love this drama.  Sitting on the edge of my seat most of the time.  The suspence was awsome.  Anyone who starts this series won't be disappointed.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love watching this show.  Wasn't sure I would like it since he cheats on her in the beginning, but it is full of drama and surprises.  Better than Law and Order.
1616550414|5.0|Got to love zelda and its history. Excellent book and excellent price considering its just so much more expensive if I purchase in store.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book may be kinky for someone living in the early 1900s but for a person who doesn't live with their head up their butt, this book was boring and had nothing to do with the real aspects of s&d.
B0010YPTGU|4.0|Andrea Boccelli is  magnificent.  Every note is perfect.  I listen to each note and it is a  Divine Gift from God.  Although his voice  is  totally trained and he can sing the most difficult pieces, his voice is not strained or scratchy, because he gives it plenty of rest.  The DVD is technically flawed in several places but I forgive that..  One disk is a DVD is a CD and I  listen to it in the car. and when I am not listening  I  still hear the echoes in my head.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Read the series of books.  Saw the movies. Wanted Blu-ray copies in my library. Bought all five. Now I have them.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I gave it a four because it erased my data when it switched over from Sydney to Tokyo. But it didn't do that to my boyfriends. So there's a glitch somewhere. If it went for that I'd have given it a five. Great game if your willing to chance losing your data. The kids love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|For anyone who reads regularly this book is an easy read but very predictable.  Maybe it was written for a younger, adolescent audience?  I would have given only 2.5 stars if I could have.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This was my first book that I received from my Kindle wish list and I'm so happy I did!<br />This was written just like Ellen speaks & it made me laugh out loud & smile!<br />I enjoy Ellen's stand up & her show.  I can now add her book to that list!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is another fantastic book, well written with full, rich characters and stunning settings.  This book follows some of the &#34;lessor&#34; characters as others have already pointed out.
B0019FWIEQ|4.0|I LOVE THE ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE.ALSO THE OUTDOORS WITH I THINK MADE IT BETTER.WHAT MAKES IT MORE BONDING THEN A FATHER AND A SON
B006LSZECO|2.0|Clever and well written novel of a psychopath, but panders to numerous stereotypes and cliches. The story line is quite unbelievable--besides being too stretched out and an over dumbing down of the police and the FBI.<br /><br />SC Smith
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I still don't know how to update my game thank you I'll just try google play I spent almost 30 minutes trying and I was just difficult thank you again
B0053IOZBE|5.0|Watches periodically on road trips. Does not mind the repetition and still laughs even after several viewings. I watched once and found it to be fairly clean entertainment.
B00985E3UG|2.0|It is really frightening, how the public can be manipulated==thru or stomachs and taste buds Reommended reading for all people concerned with their health
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show! Each episode keeps you wanting more. So excited for the next season, will buy pass again.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Visually and in story terms, this movie is amazing. I can see why it got so many oscar nominations, ten I think..
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Having been a Lee Child fan for some time now and read every Reacher novel I think Tom Cruise did a good job. It was enjoyable to watch and good entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subwaysurfers is a awesome game and everyone should try it. It keeps me quiet and you don't need enternet to play it.You should totally try the game!
1451695195|2.0|The author should have chosen another title for his book....there was no proof of heaven, and the whole book was written about an experience that can be explained in two sentences (his journey to heaven), the remainder of the book was merely a biography. I am one of those who purchased the book because I was anxious to know this new proof that no one submitted before, just to understand from people who refuted his NDE, that this NDE was just a dream occured to him when he was coming out of his coma.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|I love it.Perfect CD and cool items in game.Also I love the dota2 as well.It is really a nice gift!
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|The game is good for occupying time. The instructions for it are somewhat vague, but once you get into the game they become more clear.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I LOVE your book it shows me how to make words. It is fun Iove it. I love my dictionary its love.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Bgbub Hendrick Kandinsky McKenna Kennedy Sondheim Donald Kandinsky finance Sondheim Sondheim Sondheim Nintendo Dr be this game is awesome download it
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|If you have a strong relationship you will watch this and talk after watching.  If you are like the couple in this movie you'll laugh and squirm and clam up after the movie
B009IUH1N2|2.0|I guess if your really bored it could pass some time.  I just feel that there are more games like it that I would get first.
0679746048|5.0|I think this is an important book for young women struggling with mental illness. It's entertaining and historical. Worth the read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this on almost every device I have and its just great. Love reading on this. Much better than my nook ever was.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|although due to the limited 48 hour rental, I did NOT get to see the end, I was having trouble streaming at the time and did not realize I would not be able to see the entire movie, I wished I could have purchased the DVD instead of renting for only 48 hours, will have to purchase from elsewhere when it is available.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I just got done with the game and ,I loved it ,the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars Is that it was so long to download.....I even played the bonus .......FUN,,,,,,,,,KATRE
B0097K21YW|2.0|As has been said before, not very original. Angry Birds beats it hands down<br /><br />And, by the way, the word you're looking for is &quot;hordes&quot;.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|If you're a fan of the franchise, the director's cut which is a bit more violent but gives better insight on how John Connor learns so much about the \\"machines.\\" Also, the part in the abandoned gas station shows you something that teaches young John how to reprogram the T-100. Very cool.
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|A good book. The format is well structured and easy to read and to use in my own presentations.<br />Examples and stories, are interesting.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|firstly, I rated this five stars cause it takes average 4 hours to download a movie off the net., and faster if you pay a membership fee. I put this app on my android 7\\" tablet, and truly had no problems downloading 2 full length movies [ 2 hour movies each average ] at one time within 40 minutes !!  all for free !! and quality seemed good. cannot say enough good about this app, except, thanks Amazon !! I also downloaded this app off the net but make sure it says verified as there are malware fakes. also read in reviews how some had problems after doing a update, so i always passed on app update cause if it works why update. hope this review has helped somehow...great app !!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|A bit too heavy on the technical side. As a surgeon, he spent a bit too long on explaining his critical physical condition rather than on the 'heavenly' portion of his journey.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|Just happened to see this movie again recently, and I'm amazed how well it has held up. IMO, it is still the best of the Trek film. The special effects don't really wow anymore, but they don't look bad either. And the plot and performances are the best a Star Trek film has ever had.<br /><br />If you have the time, watch this film again.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Superb acting and great story.  If you are a newcomer to this period of history as I was, you will be well entertained and surprised by how events actually happened.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I enjoy playing this game it relieves my stress and challanges my brain.  I love the sumer time theme the most.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I travel for work and this alarm is great instead of using the hotel clock (way too difficult to figure out how to set) and I like even better on my Kindle Fire than my iPhone ( bigger screen.)<br /><br />I highly recommend.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|What a delightful surprise this book was!  McEwan is a great story-teller.My first by Ian McEwan; it won't be my last.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have been reading this series since it first started. I fell in love with the characters and the story right off. Was this book amazing? No. Not amazing. But it was good. After reading all the other books I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because I have a lot of time invested in reading and rereading them. Based by itself, I feel it deserves a 2-3 star rating, but who wants to read only the last book? This book was an ending. Things aren't wrapped up and tucked away nicely with a happy ever after. I don't know if that life exists for Sookie. I'm glad that we got to see all our favs one last time and know the way their life was heading for a while. Thank you Mrs. Harris for giving us the world of Sookie Stackhouse.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use Dropbox for storing large files, like pictures or recorded audios from seminars.  If i store it on my computer at hom and then want to access something when i am with friends, it is easy to find.  And i like sharing folders with my family, then we can keep important stuff in there and it is easy to access for everyone.  Really useful app.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Grrm is a genius! I am on my third reread of asoiaf and I still find it captivating! Can't wait for the sixth book.
B000009ED0|3.0|I couldn't find just the single of the song I wanted (except as a cover by someone lame) so had to buy the full CD.  While Kid Rock is kind of a appealing character I like very little of his music.  I think the song is called &#34;Only God Knows Why&#34;?
B0091WD4ZQ|5.0|A romance story with a lot of talking.  This is not for someone looking for a lot of action but for someone who can enjoy the spontaneous interaction of two people that meet on a train.
B00447L4KA|5.0|I'm really glad that I bought this movie. It's one of my favorite movies of all times!!! Also, it worked perfectly and I had no issues trying to play it.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Good eye hand skills needed here. Good for a child with lazy eye also. This games levels are set so they increase with skill level so it holds their attention. Worked well on trips in the car. (only draw back might be for a hyper child, it is fast passed as you advance)
B007QUUJMG|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read! Very heartfelt and easy to read. I love the letter format. Very good read totally worth te money!
B008M7JODC|4.0|Overall the show is kind of Hollywood, the guy gets the girl... there's lots of happy endings...the science is usually COMPLETELY inaccurate BUT it is still entertaining to watch. The cast does a great job, John Noble is AWESOME. I highly recommend watching, just not during dinner.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I just finished reading the final book in this series. A series that was loved for the most part. I would not write about the plot to spoil for others. Let me just say that the character that Sookie ends up with is exactly whom I figured she would be with since book one. Not the person most of the fans probably hoped it would be. But, no surprise for me. A lot of the series was wrapped up in book twelve leaving only a few of the main characters for DEA. Unlike others I feel there was endings for both Bill and Eric. Although not what most were hoping for. All in all Sookie Stackhouse will be missed.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This show is just great.  I love the characters and stories.  Stana Katic is great the cast rocks what more can I say.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|LOVED this movie.  It has a little something for everyone.  Comedy, drama, romance, action, thriller.  I especially loved John Malkovich, Helen Merren in their roles.  I would watch this movie again.
B002ZHKZEC|3.0|This is a great set except I am unable to view disc 3 &#34;The Waters of Mars&#34; all 4 of the other movies were wonderful and played beautifully but when disc 3 is inserted it says there is a formatting issue. If all discs worked this would be 10 out of 5 stars.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|It's a fun game.  It makes me think of pool because you have to angle some of the shots in.
0307749347|4.0|I am still reading, but so far I have found the information to be useful and thought provoking. It was not what I expected, however. The application of some of these thoughts has not become clear yet.
B000VHVGM8|4.0|Heard about this movie for years, and just recently had a chance to watch.  WELL WORTH IT!!!!  Very talented cast.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Very entertaining movie! The story was captivating, the acting was great, but towards the end it got very dark and hard to see without being in a theater environment. Worth watching, I think I'll read the book now.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really enjoyed the third season.  As much as the first two!  The price was right as well.  Can't wait for S4!
B00BXZ3D6Y|1.0|What good a voice recorder if you can only make one recording  and not be able to save several  for later?
B004VFMCWE|1.0|Not happy with amazon prime<br />Needs a lot of improvement<br />Constantly stops to reload to the point that I can't even partially enjoy
B00B5AIB14|4.0|Marley's &#34;Kaya&#34;, perceived by many to be his &#34;love song&#34; album, is a crisp produced affair with classic tracks such as &#34;Is This Love?&#34;, &#34;She's Gone&#34; and &#34;Satisfy My Soul&#34; as well as his typical poignant and poetic tracks--&#34;Misty Morning&#34;, &#34;Running Away&#34; and the moving &#34;Time Will Tell&#34;.  It is a brilliant album--but does it warrant an expanded, deluxe edition?  If you possess the remastered album released years ago, the live show attached to it is quite good, though not as strong as others recorded from this tour.  A must for Marley completists (myself included), but not necessary if you already own it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This reminded of the original Grisham books.  A  very smart Lawyer who was wronged by our judicial system and plots to even the score.  The characters in the book were well defined and very interesting.  The twist in the book added another level of intrigue.  A very good read.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|If you are a Ben Affleck fan you will like this movie. Based on a true story, will they make it home, when they go to the airport the suspect builds.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great time waster. keeps the hands busy and mind clear. you need to stop fishing for ratings to keep us busy.
B00BMKDTNC|1.0|Blood and bloody ashes this book was such a disappointment, I truly enjoyed the other Sanderson/Jordan posthumos collaborations.  Everything and nothing happened to finish off the series.  The characters flitted in and out of existence like the gateways, major suspense actions never happened (such as the the seachan collapse).  Uhhhgg, give Sanderson reign to finish it the way he want, or I'll just thank god it's over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun and creative game way better than temple run by a lot for me it rates 100,000
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|I loved this cd. Heavy as hell and the songs were written well. Buy it now! You won't be dissapointed
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I was finally able to figure out what was taking up all the space on my Kindle! Looks better too! Thanks for updating so frequently!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|If you like this genre of novels then all the Jack Reacher novels will keep you happy.  Great easy reading.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Lots of variety and levels.  Keeps me engaged for long periods but something I can go to if I have a short period of time and not have to reboot my head.
B0026KX4HS|1.0|I hated the quality of the streaming video.  I have watched many from Amazon and never had issues.  This one was very blurry anytime there was an action sequence, made it dizzying to watch.  My kids all noticed it and complained and even though we stopped it and tried resetting it the quality never improved.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is the best calculator app that have ever found it does what I need it to and its free
B001NHNG64|5.0|If you like this genre of novels then all the Jack Reacher novels will keep you happy.  Great easy reading.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Henry Fry is a virtual bystander to his own life, until one day he is compelled to act, without planning or forethought of any kind. As his story unfolds slowly during his long sojourn, gradually we witness a man waking up, and the impact that has on people around him, intimates and strangers alike.  This is as much his wife's story as Harold's, as she reacts to his strange behavior and begins actually to notice him for the first time in years.  The story is original, the writing beautiful, and the ending satisfying.
B001Q8FRN0|5.0|Serge Gainsbourg is a genius. This album is a bit different from his earlier works, it's a funky saga about a late night cruise which leads to an unlikely romance with a young girl Serge happens to hit with his car. The album itself is very impressive too, complete with liner notes, original artwork and lyric sheet (both in English and French). I'd reccomend this to everyone from the hardcore vinyl collector to the die-hard Serge fans out there.
B002P79KAC|5.0|This is a great show and I'm amazed that it was only recently that I discovered it! It's great to be able to go back and catch up and watch the progression of the characters over the years.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|great gameplay fun amazing graphic could use more game levels and challenges but over all good fun game I loved it
B006PW0F52|5.0|Dan Arikely has the ability to explain complex issues so that anyone can understand them. Buy the book and you will love it.
1476734941|2.0|If you have seen the Fast Diet program on PBS, this book offers very little beyond that program.  What would be better is just a book of recipes for the Fast diet.  Questions like why the exact 500\600 calories is a golden set of numbers are not answered. Its just a guess.  I would think a larger person eating 600 calories as oppsed to a thin framed shorter person eating 600 calories chould change this magic number.  This number is the number that worked for the author.  Also is the fasting perios long enough to produce the cell repair.  Does a  slightly longer fast say one 24 hour perios produce more benefits than two 12 hour fast ?<br />Guessing if you are actually eating actually 600 calories is not as easy as it seems,  Also what happens if you eat slithgly less then the 600 calories ?  Do you lose muscle ?  It seems the author is just making money on other peoples work.  I will point out that eating less on 2 days will make you lose some weight - but do you need a book to tell you that.  Just a 5:2 recipe book would be better than this one.  The book is not worth it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|a worthy continuation of the Dr. Who storylines...the series has a new sophistication while maintaining original humor, fantasy, hero vs. villians
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 was Action packed, amazing makeup, walking dead just keeps getting better. Kinda want to see the comic books and read them. Can't wait for season 4
B00000IMTG|5.0|For any rainbow fan this is one of the best live performances. Ronnie and richie doing what they do best. Not to mention cozy powell, proving he was one of the best drummers of all time. The whole band is very tight, on top of their game. This album proves the pure talent in all of the band members. A classic!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great insight in what it is like to like with a mental health problem. It is a great book and is a quick read.
B0044WSF5M|2.0|I cant believe this was a hit movie. It was tough, but my family and persevered through this. Watch Happy Days, it's better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Keeps my hands busy, very entertaining. I love to play it at the laundromat, on break...any free time I get. If I don't play it for a long time I suck..ha. its challenging and fun.i like how you base it in different parts of the world. And you can personalize you.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|I came with low expectations, but they weren't low enough.  This movie isn't just bad, it's almost a masterwork of poor movie making.  Unlike some movies that might be so over the top and basement-budgeted that they turn out to be accidentally good, T:dotm is over-produced, under acted, and has such painfully bad dialog and plot elements that it is truly unwatchable.<br /><br />I had to stop after an hour due to concern that I might tear an ocular membrane because of excessive eye-rolling.<br /><br />I won't even list the ridiculously bad basic science (but just two things, please: there is no permanently dark side of the moon; it rotates once a month since it's tidally locked to its earth orbit.  Also, an out of control, damaged space ship from another star system is unlikely in the extreme to happen to collide with anything, ever, let alone a satellite of a populated planet.  Darn, I said only two... Ok).<br /><br />The transformers themselves are reasonably well rendered cgi, but are usually of no discernible purpose.  Their dialog is infantile or<br />otherwise pointless.  The 'minor' transformer characters, including the decepticons, exist to provide throw-away lines intended to amuse the audience with their innuendo and whatnot.  It just hurts.<br /><br />...and I *enjoy* dumb, frivolous movies!  They just need to make even a little bit of sense.  Just a little...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hunger  Games started off with a bang, I could not put the book down!!!  I loved the characters in the book.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I purchased this to view on my Android device. I checked the requirements and found that they stated that it could be viewed on iPads and iPhones as well as 'other devices'. I checked the definition of 'other devices' and Amazon states that it changes from day to day. What might fall into that category one day may not on a different day. So I took a chance and lost. Surprisingly, you can view this on a Kindle, a device with an Android operating system. Could it be that they want me to buy a Kindle rather than use the one I have? By the way, Amazon bought the rights to past seasons of Downton Abbey so you can't view it anywhere else. I am usually a big fan of Amazon. Not today.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book grabbed me right away.  I found it to be a real page turner because it is such a good story that was told very well.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I downloaded the app for the camera but did not realize you cannot point and shoot, the camera faces you so you cannot see what you are taking a picture of.  It is very hard to take a good picture that way.  If you love taking pictures of yourself or anything directly behind you, then this is for you.  I do not recommend you buy this.  Very disappointed.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian Michaels rocks! I highly suggest this DVD. It will get your heart rate pumping and body shrinking in no time.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Very philosophical, funny, sad, interesting. Flawless writing. Interesting information about different cultures, the enviornment, being a teenager, mature woman and old, wise woman. I couldn't put it down, nor recommend it highly enough.
B009AP2G26|5.0|What is not perfect about this.... It's such a great show with different emotions in every episode, but still so relevant. i love it!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|You can not publish on kindle without this....download it now!  I used it and found it to be invaluable when I published my book.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I have classes on the nights this comes on and I am so glad that i can purchase them online. This episode was really sweet!!!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|The first movie was incredible and this one far exceeded my expectation. I watched on my friends' projector and my mind was blown.
B0081336FO|5.0|Season 2, Irene Adler, and Jim Moriarty addition make this series just more grand, love the great adaptation. Sherlock true fans from the books will love the way some scenes are respected and adapted to this century! Brilliant writing!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Even though I have seen some of the original episodes. The movie compiled all the necessary battles and characters enough to get you hooked. Look forward to the next one.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe, the best sci-fi TV series out there, the first season is still my favorite season, getting to know all the characters, and starting to unveil the 'other side', grand!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|luv it.... Best game  evr played on a kindle. Balanced and epic--update usually and commonly.....new characters and boards becom available after update. This Game is SOO Cool!!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|If Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would live in this century, he would approved! Fantastic adaptation! The chemistry between Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock and Martin Freeman as Doctor Watson, is a fortunate event for TV.
B009CFYRCG|5.0|Just read the opening monologue, and you can understand why this polarizing movieis either a strike or a gutter ball.<br /><br />&#34;Way out west there was this fella I wanna tell ya about. Goes by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. See, this Lebowski, he called himself &#34;The Dude&#34;. Now, &#34;Dude&#34; - there's a name no man would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so darned interestin'. See, they call Los Angeles the &#34;City Of Angels&#34;; but I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow it as there are some nice folks there. 'Course I ain't never been to London, and I ain't never seen France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Los Angeles, and this here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd seen in any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? Sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here - the Dude from Los Angeles. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude. The Dude, from Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in all of Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. Sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Well, I lost my train of thought here. But...aw, hell. I've done introduced it enough. &#34;
B00BJS7104|5.0|Had to turn my head at times, but fantastic movie! Jamie Foxx does an amazing job, again.  Not at all disappointed w/ my purchase.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|Al Pacino is amazing in this classic movie.  Highly recommend seeing it if you haven't already.  And if you have, see it again!
B005LAJ22Q|2.0|I really loved the series, in fact I watched one season using Amazon Streaming Video. But, this CD Set had a faulty disc at the last disc. Really didn't make for a great ending, as we had to rent it somewhere else and not add it to our collection. But, did receive a refund. Sorry that the disc was damaged.
B009G78EE2|5.0|One of the best CD's i have bought and enjoyed in a long time. Definitely not your typical mainstream type of rap, its way better. A refreshing look at this genre of music.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|First off, this is not a free game; after few free games, they require you to purchase credits in order to play more. Making thing worse, the game kept freezing on my KFHD. After removing the game, they continually sending me unsolicited emails for days. I would give -5 stars if I could.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|bradley cooper changed my thoughts on his acting for the better, but the film as a whole was a let-down.<br />and jennifer lawrence was too young.<br />skip it til it's free
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It very rich to the point that I can read my mother tongue even in the USA.I am from Nigeria.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|Very inspiring! Highly recommend it to anyone thinking of switching jobs, starting a new career or just finding their passion.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The writing continues to be terrible, and the sex scenes continue, but the writer does close a lot of the loops that are left open from the first two books.  It's a love story and that's it.  It's read for enjoyment, no brain needed.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|The movie was better than the book. Came on HBO I liked it. This author books would be so much better if he/she learned to think like a woman. The romance sucks and it needs a lot of heat. Erotica no, sexiness yes. I am a sucker for romance even if the book has no sex scenes,but the sexual tension it was lacking in this book,was better in the movie. Otherwise stop calling it a romance novel just because it has a sappy not happy ending.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|Great movie , blue-ray version is very nice and definition, recommend it for a Hi-res flat screen and Blue-ray player.<br />the movie don't has as many extras as the DVD version.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is hands down the best keyboard app out right now. It combines the power of swype input and touch typing without having to change any settings. Not to mention the customizability of it is great...from colors to key height, themes and word learning. Highly recommend!!
B007MG360G|1.0|I enjoyed the other doodle games so I downloaded this one. It stops after just a few seconds every time I try to play it on the kindle fire HD. Bummer because it looks like it would be fun.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Though a little corny with some over the top acting, this movie was entertaining. Being pregnant myself currently, I could relate to pretty much all the characters. If I weren't pregnant while watching I may not have enjoyed it as much.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Other than the hero worship of one person which I felt was an affront to everyone else's efforts in the search for Bin Laden - the movie is an amazing piece of work. Just a little short of a masterpiece.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|After reading the first two books and got all hyped about it even though the writing is nothing but mediocre. I haven't finished this book because I got bored. I managed to read 3 other books in the meantime  which were more way better than the whole series. I will give  a weak 3 for the series just because it is a love story with a happy ending.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Absolutely loved this!!  It is brillant buy on blue ray the difference on the regular dvd to blue ray is greatly indeed the way to go to enjoy the orginal Star Trek again.  Would highly recommend anyone to buy for sure.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|The album is solid, good production, a very good mix of hard and slow tempo songs.<br />Ian Gillan is not the wailing banshee he once was but he still can hit very high notes and sing perfectly in tune.<br />Other than that, Steve Morse is a highlight in this album, I even feel he is better in this CD than on Purpendicular, which is IMHO their best release until Now What?!<br />It is worth the money and you will be glad with the whole album.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Sooner or later we all grow up and Ted is no exception. What was once so cute and cuddly is now rough and cynical from experiencing more and more of life. The best part, who cares that Ted chases women, is a stoner and never really wants to grow up. This politically incorrect film is NOT for children or teens. They will find out soon enough about how adults don't always do as they say. Sit back with a brewski, fire up some smoke and remember what it was like to be young and dumb!
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I still love this show. Retains it's high quality writing and acting, but the plot was a bit soap-opera-ish this season. The set up for the next season has some real potential. We'll see how that plays out...
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This is still a funny and enjoyable movie years later! I'm looking forward to the prequel coming out next month!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Marvel at the diversitiy of the characters presented.  Maggie saves the day and comes to the rescue in a low-key way!
0735619670|5.0|I was having difficulty conveying some foundational computer science principles and best practices to some junior team members, this book really helped me formulate good talking points around things like naming conventions and other basic concepts.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wonderful story. Anguish, desperation, hope, friendship during one of history's darkest times. Written for teens but excellent read for any age.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is definitely the next step in the development and evolution of Tool as a group and as individuals.  If you were expecting &#34;Undertow&#34; or &#34;Ænima&#34; You'll probably be disappointed.  But if you listen with an open mind and realize that this is 10 or more years since these two releases, it will grow in you. They are all very talented people and it is clear they worked hard to expand and grow on their talent and skill.
