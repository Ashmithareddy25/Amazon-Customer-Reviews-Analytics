B000FBJHZS|4.0|Enjoyed reading all his other books and this one while not a Davinci code is still worth reading and doe entertain
B00846REIS|1.0|Not a very appealing book.  Just a knock off of a popular trend in writing.  Not enough depth to make for good reading.  I would skip this one.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Rates right up there with Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice!  I would recommend for anyone who loves classic love stories
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I thought that this had the potential to be a decent movie.  It was slow and boring at the start and I started to shut it down.  But, it did pick up and eventually had a good ending.  Looks like a setup for a follow on.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Wish it had a different ending. Most of the plot was good but it's kind of scary to think that cyberwarfare is upon us.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great get a way film.<br />Never know what's next and just when you think you know what's coming..WHAM! MORE SURPRISES.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Okay, some people might hate having to play a game where it requires a Facebook account to even PLAY the game. Um... question: How many of those people have played Angry Birds Friends? Because this is one of those games. Oh, and if you don't have a Facebook account, all you can do are the Power-up practice levels. I would've put this game higher, but I don't want thousands of people trying to tear my house down because I hate this game. Boy, would THAT hurt!
1932100660|5.0|The book was recommended to us by my wife's personal trainer.  We are both retired and attempting to optimize our health and activities as we establish new paths in our lives.  We are aware that reasonable exercise and eating habits alone are not enough, and relying on maintenance medications can mask otherwise deteriorating health conditions.<br />This book covers a great deal of ground in &#34;food technology&#34; and assists in establishing guidelines for food selection and eating habits.  Documentation of eating studies in other countries is both enlightening and interesting.  While we have to be careful to avoid blindly following all its content and recommendations, we are finding it to be highly beneficial in getting us to study our shopping list with new awareness and to make wiser selections.<br />So far so good!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son and I are addicted. Lots of fun.  I'm glad I came across this game last night. I wish we knew about it sooner.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|very good, easy to clip on, scratches easily, will change after one holiday - go pro cap only fits on the lens, not on the filter - but its very good. remember to clear the bubbles before you film!
B0042TV4IW|3.0|So far it's progressing at a dry pace. This doesn't stop me from watching and hoping for a more interesting story line.
0439023521|5.0|It took four days to get here, that was great, I have not read it yet but I am excited
1475143389|5.0|This is not the muscle magazine's supplement advertisement type of book.<br /><br />He simply addresses what is important when you build your muscle, based on science and university studies.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|even without a complete description of how to play, you will find it easy enough as you go along....hunt and peck with your fingers and all of a sudden it becomes clear.  Definitely fun.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|As always, I adore anything Criminal Minds related! Not a huge fan of Alex Blake, but maybe I'll learn to like her at least as much as Elle Greenaway. No one will ever be able to fill Emily Prentiss' shoes!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I didn't like the ending.  It seemed a bit of a let down, but overall I found it very entertaining.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|Immediately following the aftermath of the first Halloween, we have Laurie Strode on her way to the clinic for treatment and Dr. Loomis searching for Michael Myers.  Michael Myers eventually follows Laurie to the clinic and continues his plan to eliminate his sister.  Dr. Loomis is determined to stop him- but will he survive to see the end of Michael Myers?<br /><br />Halloween II is the best sequel in the series.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|A great app for cleaning up my  memory &amp; storage on my Kindle and my Kindle HD.The first time I ran it on my oridginal Kindle it cleaned up between 2 and 3 gigs of space. I've had no problems with Clean Master and  highly recommend it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a great game. Love it. It is a great game for adults. And it keeps you on your toes. You should get it.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I got this app for my tablet and it works well.  I haven't experienced any of the problems I have read in other reviews.  The only down side I have encountered is it doesn't give you the option to sign out so all your mail is available to anyone that uses it.  This hasn't been a problem for me because nobody else uses my tablet and I keep it password protected to access it.
B002LBGBEK|5.0|The goods:<br />- Beautifully remastered cover. Really beats the original in umph.<br />- Record sounds better than original mono. It loses the muddiness from the 60s.<br />- The label and record itself looks amazing and is pressed with quality and care.<br /><br />The confusion:<br />- The record was placed in a &#34;66 on Capitol&#34; inner sleeve trying to replicate to old inner sleeves Capitol records came in. The problem here is that this album came out in 1965 and would have had Capitol's 1965 red inner sleeve. When I bought the &#34;From the Capitol Vaults Pet Sounds&#34; it had the original copy of the inner sleeve separate from the record which was housed in a plastic/paper audiophile inner sleeve which keeps the record safer. &#34;Today!&#34; just had the record in the original copy of the old inner sleeve which was kind of a bummer, yet I had my own inner sleeves to correct the issue.<br />- If you care a less about accuracy in time period and what sleeve your record is stored in it is an AMAZING piece to buy. Even for audiophiles. Sounds VERY good. Just don't throw away your originals...they are still cool too.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I wasreally impresseed by this movie - it didn't get that much buzz when it was released.  We rented it, and WOW.  Great plot twists.  Great story.  Also quite impressed with the acting, but awsome effects!  Thumbs up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has been great for the whole family. Easy for my kids to understand yet still enjoyable for me as an adult
B000GCFG7E|5.0|All the suspense  expected from Jack,  edge of your seat reading, excellent thriller that Child is known for.  Can't wait  for the next one<br />™
B00005JOIH|5.0|I must say that Spielberg is truly a master in the art of action/adventure features, but Munich (along with Schindler's List) has to be without a doubt his finest work.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|This is not a very good book, yet it was a &#34;fun&#34; read for Austen afficionados.  PDJames writes so well that she can keep one reading, despite the fact that the plot was strained and improbable, and neither Elizabeth nor Darcy really sounded like their originals.  I'm not sure that there is anyway to replicate the original tension between the two characters with any other factor, since they seem to be getting on so well.  That tension was one of the major themes in the original.  I think only Jane Austen could sound like Jane Austen and I've not seen any<br />sequel to Pride and Prejudice that works.  Fania Fyodor<br /><br />Fania Fyodor
B00957T6X6|5.0|Magnificently crafted, with deep insight into characters and intense narrative. Very graphic, not for the faint of heart, but the violence and sex are not gratuitous. Power, money and deceit clash with honor and integrity.The &#34;good guys&#34; don't always win, the heroes are not always fearless and the villains are not always unidimensional. A complex, multi-layered, very enjoyable saga.
1400069742|5.0|I have read in 2013. This is a period in world history of which I was not well versed. I am now after reading the thoroughly engrossing relationships between the myopic, self-righteous anti-war isolationists and, defenders of democracy and decency.  I have since read, \\"The Hopkins Touch: Harry Hopkins and the Forging of the Alliance to Defeat Hitler.\\" I find Lynne Olson's treatment a more compelling read. Check it out from your local library. You won't be sorry.
B008602KQI|4.0|I didn't even want to see the movie when it came out. The concept of putting a bunch of children in a gladiator's ring to kill each other is just barbaric. Then I read the book. As usual the books are always better than the movies. But if you don't read the book first, in this case, you miss a lot of things that are going on in the movie. I think it's imperative to read the books before you see the movies.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Took me almost three chapters to figure out how to follow the story. Once I did, couldn't put it down. Interesting writing method.
0062255657|1.0|I had never read Neil Gaiman before and since this book was listed quite highly on the Bestseller's List, I figured it would be worth my time to give his work a try. It only goes to show that not everything on the Bestseller's List is for me.<br /><br />It began interestingly enough and the writing style was good, but as it progressed I wasn't sure what to make of it all. Maybe I'm just past the age of reading fairytales, as everyone hinted that this was, in fact, that type of book.<br />I kept reading assuming the ending would justify continuing, but it didn't. It left you hanging with no clue as to where this all went or the purpose. I'm sure of the author's name was John Smith, it would have gone nowhere.<br /><br />I consider myself well read. Literary fiction is my preference and I thought I would give myself a change by trying a different genre. Well, I did, but I was sorely disappointed.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|It reminds me of when i was in the Marie Corp back in 1956 some times rougher,it brought back old memories. Lee Ermey  was at<br />San Diego recruit depot when i was their.  oo rah
B003L77NKY|5.0|Great addition to the series. Can be viewed as a stand alone, but definitely should be watched as part of the series to be totally understood.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Outstanding Memphis Blues, Boz Scaggs is the master guitarist. Great tunes to listen to all day and all night long.
B00AEBB8FQ|5.0|Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., and Jack Black star in Tropic Thunder, the story of a film crew aiming to make the most expensive war movie ever. However, things soon go wrong in the hands of an inexperienced director, and the actors find themselves in Vietnam-with real bad guys. Hilarious comedy ensues, and some of the jokes will have your stomach hurting from laughter. Robert Downey Jr. gives an excellent performance in this film, playing Australian actor Kirk Lazarus (who plays an African-American sergeant in the movie). He seriously could have won Best Supporting Actor, had the Dark Knight come out another year (RIP, Heath). Each character has their own quirks and funny moments, and some running jokes throughout the movie actually stay funny! All of the other actors in the movie give great performances as well, especially Tom Cruise and Nick Nolte. If you're easily offended, however, you probably won't like this film as much. It makes many jokes about sex, mental retardation (although more of the actors who portray mentally retarded people in their films), and racism. Nothing is super-offensive, however. In the end, this movie is great if you want to have a couple really funny  and entertaining hours. Hope this helped!
B00138CYD4|5.0|No question about it, he's the best Latin pop/rock guitarist.  He plays with everyone and everyone wants to play or sing with him
B004SIP7US|5.0|Brand new, in perfect condition when received. I've loved this movie for years and finally got to introduce it to my family!
B00E193TM2|5.0|heavy & brutal! Mama said knock you out! I'm gonna knock you out! Great Metal band...just saw them in Mayhem, awesome!
B005M5NDCA|5.0|What a talented young artist! Scotty definitely deserved to win American Idol and has not disappointed with his first CD, Clear as Day. Every song is a gem and I expect nothing but even better work out of this genuinely gifted singer.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes. I first read the books as a young teenager and instantly fell in love. I think this is the best tv version and I have seen many of them. The modernization of Sherlock (use of cell phones, texting, and the Internet) works. I was afraid it would take away some of the &#34;magic&#34; but that is not the case. The acting is superb! I only wish there was more than 3 episodes per season and the seasons weren't spaced so far apart.
B000ZM7VVO|5.0|Great CD.  Love flogging Molly Cd did not disappoint.<br />Would recommend for sure.  Listen to CD on my Kindle Fire and IPOD.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Beats hollywood for story telling. Just goes to show you don't know where life will take you, if you're open to change.  The well seasoned actors were perfect for their parts.  Worth the purchase.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I don't want to write a review but I will anyway just because there is a blank space to fill.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|Where do I begin?<br /><br />This wondrous, shattering, electrifying, deeply humane film moved me so profoundly upon first seeing it a preview studio screening that when I approached John Hurt afterward to tell him how deeply his performance had touched me I found that I could only get out a few heartfelt words before my throat closed up completely and tears spilled down my cheeks. Oh Lord -- what is the man going to think?! Well, I was stunned when Hurt put his arms around me, hugged me close, and whispered in my ear \\"Thank you. That is the greatest compliment I have ever received. But those tears aren't for me - they're for John Merrick.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, I found myself going home in an emotionally drained yet exhilarated daze, and could not sleep because of the haunting primal power of Lynch's extraordinary artistry, the unforgettable, heartbreaking score by John Morris (a family friend), the exquisite black and white cinematography by Freddie Francis, the astonishing make-up by Christopher Tucker, and the magnificent performances by the entire ensemble of brilliant actors.<br /><br />Equal parts fable, fairy-tale, and dark, brooding, industrial-revolution nightmare, 'The Elephant Man' is that true rarity - a film filled with compassionate sentiment which somehow manages to be neither maudlin nor cloying: a miracle given the myriad potential traps inherent in the subject matter.<br /><br />Both hellish and heavenly, 'The Elephant Man', along with 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet', 'The Straight Story' and 'Mulholland Drive', is one of Lynch's finest artistic achievements and destined to be a timeless classic. Miss it at your peril.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Tends to drop me directly in front of obstacles after bonuses in El Macho's Lair, otherwise it's awesome. Great fun!
B002A4Q652|5.0|This is the second cd that I purchased from Delain. The vocals are great and the instrumentals are decent. Overall I am enjoying it.
1451695195|4.0|Dr. Alexander's book was a very enjoyable read and made me think of the Afterlife from a different perspective.<br />I highly recommend his book to those who do not believe in God and the Afterlife as it's written from a scientific point of view versus a religious person's perspective.<br /><br />Helen<br />Loomis, CA
B008OW1S3O|5.0|The first single I heard from this album was \\"Breezeblocks\\" and I will admit I didn't like it immediately. The sound is completely unique. After listening to it a few more times, I was hooked. I purchased the whole album and laid in bed one night with my earbuds in really concentrating on the music. The sound is so interesting and developed, unpredictable to the point where your mind can't think of where it will go next and then a harmony beautiful enough to carry you off into the sunset pounds your eardrums and you become are a slave to what you are hearing. Every song is intense. Every song has the capacity to draw you in and fill your heart with emotion. If you are looking for a new sound that will move you, this is your album.
B00DB31Y3U|1.0|why does a game need to access information about my networks? its a game not a networking tool. remove all the apps with questionable permissions and amazon might have something
B005HED11Y|5.0|I had forgotten how much I loved this show ! I used to watch it all the time as a kid .... It's great to see it again and appreciate the stories even more !!
1781162646|3.0|It's a short read that leaves the horror genre Mr. King is so famous for and falls more within the confines of a murder mystery.  It's always fun to read anything written in the first person and he does a good job of that, but don't look for a Shining or Misery quality.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app simple quick and easy to use... Recommend this app to anyone. Love the big display and I am happy with design. Thank you for keeping it simple.
B008602KQI|4.0|Based on the book with same title, this teen action film stars Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson and tells the story of a future in which child sacrifice takes place in the form of a reality TV contest. Personally I find it difficult to believe that a woman wrote this type of a story. ... Movie Review: Hunger Games (2012) » Katarina Nolte<br />[...]
B005LAJ17M|5.0|We wanted to see Homeland since it is filmed in our city, Charlotte,NC. Discounting that it is one of the best shows we have ever watched. We are grateful to have been able to have purchased this like new used Blu-ray from Amazon and now have signed up for Showtime to watch Season 2 and 3.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Loved it when it was first on the air.  Love it now.  Didn't realize MacGyver and the Head man in SG1 were the same.  Knew he looked familiar, but couldn't place him.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Could not wait to finish and looking forward to the next sequel.  Enjoyed very much the series so far.  Looking forward to reading more of Archer's books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to read. Easy to use and it was free. Would recommend to any Kindle owner. You should give it a try.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was awesome! It drew me in from the first few pages and kept me hooked until the end. The only time I have the chance to read is at night so I planned on reading a few pages a night and then falling asleep but I soon discovered how impossible that was. I found myself staying up late reading 50 pages a night. I was HOOKED! This was my second time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I plan on downloading more!
B000X2H8G4|5.0|This is great. It is like you are right there. The head phones are great nothing to stick in your ear. I had other people try it too and they all loved it.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book was amazing! It was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and now I'm hooked. From the very first page it draws you in and it's impossible to put it down. I am definitely downloading more from the author who is a fantastic writer!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I searched the app store for a alarm clock and I tried one but it sucked them I tried this one and I love it it did what the it was supposed to do plus more.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|After hearing the rave about this show, I finally broke down and bought the first season just to see what all the hype was about. I'm so glad I did! It's amazing and I would recommend it to everyone!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I already sent a critique of the movie to you.<br /><br />It is a dark movie, not fit for the TV screeen.
B005UG542S|4.0|Not as exciting as Part 1 but definitely worth a watch. The quality in terms of picture was not phenomenal. The sound was a little off too, but nothing significant
B000FBJG04|5.0|A great story of some real soldiers who were just citizens who wanted to be the best. I will read again in the future.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I recently lost my husband to cancer. I wish we had TALKED more and had not been so stoic.  I wish we had shared our fears.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Wonderful characters - gives you the flavor of the people and the way they lived.  Like Monarch of the Glen, but in England in earlier times.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My husband and I love every character on this show.  The stories are interesting, funny, sad, and leave you with wanting more.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Trashy trashy trashy which is good when it's about the sex but oh so bad when it's about the writing.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|very good, interesting plot, somewhat difficult to follow at times, very good overall. Would recommend it if you like sy/fy.
0316228583|2.0|I have not read any Harry Potter books and had no particular expectations. I got the audio book at Cracker Barrel for a long road trip and hoped for the best. I was amazed at how bad this book was. I thought the underlying premise, setting, and characters could have made for great drama. But, ultimately the book is about six dysfunctional families and you pretty much want to strangle all the adults. There is rape, incest, domestic violence, and other unpleasant actions. However, there is no suspense or mystery--when anonymous things occur, she tells you who is doing them as they happen. There are no likeable characters, just unhappy parents, unhappy teenagers, and a lot of bad results. The moral to the story is apparently that at least some people will appreciate each other more and get past their anger once really, really bad things happen. I found the plot boring and probably shouldn't have hung on until the end.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I enjoy playing temple run and I recommend it to people of all ages, but I didn't like the challenges and goals it set as much. I do think the upgrade is better than the original version though.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I enjoyed the entire season1 of Falling Skye's. it has a pretty good story line and the character's story lines are good
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|&#34;THE HUNGER GAMES&#34; is an outstanding movie of how things could effect the world and its people! It shows the positive and negatives of the a world of hunger and needs.
B001NHN7TU|3.0|The is not your typical \\"monster\\" and different enough to make you wonder, first, what could it be and, second, how are they going to make this work.  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward do a good job as a couple of good ol' boys trying to figure out what's going on and you certainly identify with all of the cast of characters (even the not-so-smart ones) and want them to escape the \\"fiends.\\"  The husband and wife pair of Michael Gross and Reba McEntire do a great job and almost steal the show.  It might not be too far fetched to describe how the boys and girls finally handle the \\"monsters\\" as a cliffhanger.
B009G41CG2|3.0|Manning is a strategy base game that assist in solving problems by way of looking at the entire picture to make move and matches of tiles in various areas on the board.
B0007PALZ2|1.0|The actors were absolutely great.  The story just didn't cut it - too far fetched.  The ending was especially bad.<br />Doc
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The chromecast is by far the best product yet. Easy to setup and works great with my phone. I can't wait until more apps are compatible with it. Definitely recommend it.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I was about to throw a bunch of LPs out but decided to add a turntable to my receiver and listen to the oldies again.  I liked the idea of being able to make CDs of the records -- that, unfortunately, is harder than I anticipated.  I loaded the software but that is as far as I have gotten.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Everything that I expected...and more. I am a big fan of the Alien series, and I was not disappointed by this anthology. You will enjoy it.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|This was the second time I've ordered a video on a Friday night and it failed to download and did not go into Video Library. It was charged, though.<br /><br />I use Instant Video all the time. Weekends seem to be the problem.<br /><br />Took a while to find how to contact Amazon.  No mechanism on Orders page to give feedback to Amazon.  You have to work your way through the Help pages.  I'm sure they'll take care of it now but they need to fix the system.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Of course, Amazon took care of it the next morning.  it's downloading now.  They just need to stop this from happening.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|A pleasant diversion that doesn't tangle you up in knots, but instead makes you feel like you are up to the challenge. Not a difficult game, but not for everyone.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like this game but might have to eventually delete it. They want money. It's cool that you play live people.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|this is a great series, finally something worth watching on TV!!! I love it, love it, love it! Can't wait for new season to begin!
B0041VV03A|5.0|My wife is a geneticist and this is the most hilarious flick we've seen in ages!<br /><br />It is the Michele Bachmann of sci-fi: there are so many things wrong, in such quick order, that you have no choice but to run with it.<br /><br />It is the Financial Crisis of horror movies: literally every single line of dialogue in this film is yet another person making yet another terrible, terrible choice.<br /><br />I shall treasure this grotesque unabortion forever.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|my grandson just recently discovered this show, had to watch all episodes, thanks for having it on Amazon!!! thank you!
B004FEJ3VY|2.0|This toy is cheaply made, hard to transform and it LITERALLY fell apart after ONE day of play. Do not buy this.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|it is what it is a good popcorn flick all of your old fav. action stars kicking butt in non stop action and cheesy one liners like I'LL Be Back!
B00509ODFO|4.0|4 1/2 stars. Listed as 4 due to no closed captions available in season one or two through the Amazon streaming product.<br /><br />ALSO NOTE: Season 2, Episode 20 Gauntlet does NOT show up as purchased even when the entire season is bought. I called Amazon and they are checking into that for me. I remember that Gauntlet was released as a separate DVD through Netflix, and it may be there is a glitch keeping it from being considered part of season 2<br /><br />Knowing how some series can be pulled without notice, I wanted to make sure that this ALWAYS stays in my Amazon library.<br /><br />So I purchased both seasons and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I've found this series to be fascinating with very few downsides, except for the vapid and shallow acting of Elyse Levesque in the role of Chloe Armstrong.<br /><br />Then again, perhaps she is being directed to appear vapid and shallow, in which case, she is outstanding.<br /><br />I really HATE Ming-Na Wen in her role as Camile Wray, but I think I'm supposed to hate her, which means she is doing a great job.<br /><br />It took me until the end of the second season to really see the subtle brilliance of David Blue's acting in his role as Eli Wallace.<br /><br />I would have to spoil the story to explain, so I'll let you discover what I mean by maturing character development.<br /><br />Who's the star? For me, it has been a tossup between Louis Ferreira as Col. Everett Young, Alaina Huffman as 1st Lt. Tamara Johansen and the Destiny ship herself.<br /><br />Johansen ultimately gets my vote because of the depth of her character and her amazing screen presence.<br /><br />She never misses a beat.<br /><br />Honorable mention for Jamil Walker Smith as Msgt. Ronald Greer.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention that the part of Dr. Nicholas Rush was made for Robert Carlyle?<br /><br />His performance here should absolve him of his guilt for taking on the role of Mr Gold in Once Upon A Time.
B000NTPDSW|1.0|This set was a REALLY GOOD DEAL especially on Blu-ray.  These are really great films.  However, the sound quality sucks!  In order to watch these films you LITERALLY have to keep the volume control remote in your hand at all times to keep adjusting the sound level.  What a disappointment.
1577314808|5.0|I expected another self help, feel good book lik on mass market. I was wrong, wrong.  I was afraid it would negate my faith in Christ, it only strengthened it. Truly is a self help book but on a deep spiritually enlightening journey into and out of myself. Expanded consciousness.<br />Must read.  Not light and flowery language, but a very intellectual, enlightened literary achievement
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I think this is just a great game app.  Very easy to use.  Love the note feature.  I just wish they would have added an info section for tips and tricks.  It would help you learn more as.you play.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|wow!!! it is sad story but it is written so well that you feel good for Hazel. i enjoyed reading it. 4 stars
0307277887|4.0|Unfortunately, this book took way too long to arrive. It had priority two day shipping but it took two weeks to get here.<br />Regardless, I wish it had the Dexter show cover instead of the older cover! It does not match the theme of the book/show at all and makes Dexter look like a softie haha. But as a fan of all 8 seasons, I think it does justice to the show by laying down the foundation for it.
B009WUBERW|1.0|Just a terrible movie.  Wish I had not wasted my time watching it, but it was free from Prime.  Will not watch a 3rd one if it comes out even if it is on Prime.
B004ECBFYU|5.0|This is a great book. I couldn't put it down once I started to read it. I definitely would recommend this book for people to read.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Made it very easy to post for the first time.  Only issue was that the preview didn't show that shipping was free.  It made me question whether I had done everything correctly.  It turned out that I had.

1451626096|4.0|I was eagerly anticipating this book as I have read all Gregory's books on the cousins war. It was a very fast read read for me and put forth some interesting theories. I was surprised to find myself intensely disliking Henry VII because I have always been a huge Tudor fan. I also thought Elizabeth was quite weak as compared to her mother Elizabeth Woodville. Nevertheless this was very fast read for me , once I started I could not stop. I thought all the characters were well rounded . I felt great sympathy For Teddy spending his whole life living in the tower. I especially enjoyed the part about Perkin Warbeck. I suppose many of these mysteries will never be solved but it was interesting getting another viewpoint on what happened to the princes in the tower. My only complaint is I thought the book ended too soon! I wish it had continued until Elizabeth's death. I was looking forward to Catherine Of Aragon coming.to court. I would like to read more about Henry and Arthur coming of age. More Please.
B00CS0XOQW|4.0|A very nice compilation though I feel that it reflects the mood of the economy crisis the world is going through. This may be positive for some and negative for others.
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|I began watching this show for the legal aspect of it. I've always enjoyed watching clever people rationalize around our legal system. &#34;Suits&#34; includes that with the added aspect of good vs. bad. &#34;Suits&#34; has very good writing with subtleties that go past very quickly, just enough for intelligent people to have a quiet laugh. I did not give it a 5 star rating because I got bored with the childish boy/girl relationship between Mike and Rachel, which caused the season ending to be a disappointment to me.

B0056BU3I2|5.0|Expect something similar to the other entries in the series, especially the first and fourth (with the same main characters).  Not a big &#34;thinker&#34;, but lots of fun.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Have loved this app since it first came online.  Wonderful sourse for connecting with family and friends.  I love Facebook.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|We have a small book club which has been together for fifteen years.  This is the first time in all those years that we all were in consensus about the disappointment in a book we read.  Though we occasionally found humor in one of the worst places on earth, we found little else to commend.  Though it is a novel we were disappointed that there was nothing new to learn about North Korea...and there was a lot of repetition regarding the situation there.
B008KZVNFS|4.0|5 hours of drama, history and a little romance, too.<br />Benedict Cumberbatch is almost unrecognizable here, looking like a middle aged, almost frumpy version of himself. His character is a very somber, quiet, dry guy stuck in a marriage to a woman trying to get his attention by cheating openly.<br />The series drags a little here and there but i found it entertaining. Worth a look.
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|The whole movie, from the beginning pre-launch in France, until near the end--is a gripping and realistic war film from the point of view of the Germans soldier/naval officers, who were mainly not aligned with Hitler.  However, I found the end to be somewhat Stephen King-like--of which I will not give any spoilers.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Second season of BBC Sherlock is just fantastic.......3 great stories ending in the biggest cliffhanger i have ever seen.<br />I love all the characters, the development of the friendship between Sherlock and Watson. Nothing else like it on TV
B0090XLDKY|5.0|I bought this as a birhday gift for my granddaughter.  She's 11 but loves the old time musicals.  This is a particular<br />favorite of hers.
B007PF7MGS|2.0|This book starts with some excellent points about eating meat and seafood.  The points are made better, and with more backup, in The China Study.  To its credit, the book encourages non-gluten starches, but really doesn't discuss the plusses and minuses of gluten at all.<br /><br />But the book really seems to go off-track on oils and fats.  The recommended diet is almost 100% fat free.  That seems just as radical going carb-free.<br /><br />To be fair, I didn't try it.  It just seems crazy.  I am already a healthy weight, and was reading the book for additional insights into nutrition.
1451695187|5.0|If you have an open mind this will be a good read for you it is not a big book but it has big ideas
B001F6TXME|5.0|Works great, and opens up all kinds of possibilities.  I love having the shutter button in my hand, and ability to hold shutter open for those types of shots.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft pe is very fun but I think you should make accounts so we can play with anybody anytime. Accounts would also be nice so then if I get a new electronic I can have all my world's on my new electronic. go minecraft!!!!!!
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Loved this book---it was great from beginning to end.<br />Looking forward to reading more of his books. Looked forward to<br />reading it every chance I got.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Not at all what I thought it would be!  it was better!  I enjoyed it!  The effects were great!  Very cool movie!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This app is fun at the beginning but then it's boring and then when the vector battle comes along then it's sort of funny again.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like it!  It looked like it might be stupid or silly.  It actually was good!  My brother enjoyed it as well!
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|I enjoyed this narrative expository of Hitchcock's story. I felt it appropriated a tenderness towards Hitchcock's human nature, instead of positioning him in any sort of wholly negative or positive light. His seemingly cold solidarity separated him from most of Hollywood through his career, but this film illuminates the humanism of his character.<br /><br />Hitchcock clearly struggles with self-understanding. He exudes a need for power, a trait widely recognized by those who worked with him. He struggled with narcissism, and expected 100% from everybody always. One of the most moving scenes of the story is when Alma challenges the basis of his accusation that she is having an affair and not supporting him. Though a strongly passive character until that point, she unleashes her perspective on how deeply she supports Hitchcock through all his trials. The audience is allowed to see a vulnerability in Hitchcock as he goes through the realization that his accusation has truly offended the one person who he values above all else, and that it was based out of an insecurity from his own tendency to have wandering eyes.<br /><br />The same sort of raw humanism is seen in the scene where he takes over the stabbing scene from Psycho. Though I'm not positive that it stays perfectly true to history, Hitchcock's insipid imagination placed Alma in the shower and he stabs relentlessly out of a seething detest in her potential to betray him.<br /><br />Lastly, as an artist, Hitchcock placed a lot of weight in the power of music. As he explored the horror medium, he found it brought him great joy.  The scene of Psycho's premiere, where Hitchcock waits from the climactic shower scene, he moves melodically to the sound of the audience screaming. He does not move to the tempo of the musical soundtrack of the piece, but instead to the rhythm of reaction. This is a powerful expression of Hitchcock's connection to his work, on many artistic and spiritual levels.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This zombie apocalypse take on Romeo and Juliet was fun, although not particularly intricate. I enjoyed it and would watch it again.
B005VMSATA|5.0|Good movie. Sourced well from the comic book. Would have liked more ring/special effect action but still a good story
B005IQZB14|5.0|Incredible journey through life and the Pacific Crest Trail for brilliant author Cheryl Strayed!  Thrilling and a true page-turner!  Strayed keeps her audience enthralled with descriptions of her encounters with nature and her struggles with herself and her past.  A must-read!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|What else can I say...  Ladies will love it.  Nothing special about this chick flick that differentiates it from any other
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I just loved the book from beginning to end.  Enzo reminds me of my dog who is 14 years old... needless to say I was in tears for a lot of it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a remarkable true story, filled with the scientific insight of Dr. Eben Alexander III, a neurosurgeon well-respected among his peers, who contracted a virulent disease which attacked his brain, throwing him deep into a 7-day coma, taking him into near-death experience never before survived by any human. Dr. Alexander's incisive scientific and extra-scientific analyses of his own NDE in spite of previously unheard of damage to parts of his brain left me wondering if, under the same circumstances, other scientists could overcome their scientific biases to come to Dr. Alexander's same conclusions.
B001NTJV6G|4.0|I think she has a very nice voice.  The vocal/music is similar to Corrine Bailey Rae and Beth Hirsch.  Again, album is very mellow and contemplative.
B005LAII4E|1.0|Very disappointed. Channing is only in it for 10 minutes. Not what I was expecting compared to the first one.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|The beginning starts off pretty quiet (dialogue wise).  There wasn't much of a preamble to the story line.  Frankly, by the end of the movie, I was lost to who was who.  I'll probably watch it again to see what if anything I missed.  I'm a Tom Cruise admirer otherwise I'd skip a second view.
0525952926|5.0|Fiction based on historical fact is my favorite read and the second book of the trilogy is as outstanding as the 1st book.  I am actually a little annoyed that the third book isn't published yet.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Unique Story Line Every time, Magnetic Characters, Quality Production, one of the best and free to stream for Prime members!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Fairly good story---the acting is superb from every one in the film.  Who are those kids?  Future stars.  Different kind of roll for McConaughey and he hit it out of the park.
B009NX409M|5.0|Despite the fact that it is about two married people falling in love, it really is a good movie.  Well acted and entertaining.  You do feel for their spouses and yet you are able to see that they are both not truly happy in their marriages.  Very interesting without being torrid.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|I collect watches.  I have quite a few; but I worn this watch for the past two months since I received it.  The watch is stylish, accurate timing, and fun to wear.
B00BP0L224|4.0|We used this in our book discussion group and we all thought it was interestingly told from the child's point of view.  This type of writing limits the normal descriptions that would be availble from a 3rd party view, however it was very well written.  I think it should be manditory reading for all educators in public schools.<br />The women in the group commented on how difficult it would be to have a child you couldn't touch or really understand.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|Capitalism and Freedom is an excellent book for someone who is looking an introduction to liberalism. Milton Friedman debunks many Statist policies that most people think are doing good with facts and logic. I recommend this book to all the liberal (in the classical sense) minded people.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|Good movie, overall. Some good surprises for the first time, but had a hard time with Mila Kunis - when she raised her voice, all I could think of was Meg from Family Guy.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is a really great film that will bring out lots of laughter and some silent tears. I highly recommend it.
B005QYKE2Y|2.0|This is an okay film to zombie out with on Amazon Prime, but I would not have paid money for it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app made me fall in love with the concept of Pinterest. it works great and the new ability to send pins to friends is so handy.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I have watched this over and over it is a wonderful show.  You will enjoy every minute of it. Enjoy
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book to my friend in school and my mom.I liked when they put the romantic comedy and romantic love and relationships with someone you knew as a friend of sorts and how they got to like each other when they got put into the arena. And I sorta liked and disliked the part when they lied and trys to make Katniss and Peter to kill each other and that was very smart the way they decided to die with each other and not alone so they could stay together.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Wow I had heard this was a great movie.  It lived up to the reviews from others.  It is so good...
B004WN1A7S|5.0|I purchased this on impulse because I wanted to try using a gaming mouse pad to see if they are any better than the cheap cloth mat I was previously using. This mouse pad didn't increase my K/D or anything like that, but it is very well made and my mouse works perfectly on it.
B005HSL626|1.0|This is my favor game in IOS. It seems that Kindle fire HD cannot support this game with poor response. Amazon should take this off the apps store.
1593083807|4.0|&#34;Northanger Abbey&#34; is not my most favorite of Austen's works but this edition is quite nice and I especially like several additional things included in it, such as outstanding quotes from the work, a brief biography of the author, an excellent Introduction, what inspired its writing, a detailed chronological timetable of  &#34;The World of Jane Austen and Northanger Abbey&#34;, and  Comments and Questions by readers.  These additions inspire me to look into it further than I had done previously.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|It's definitely challenging.  The only thing I don't like is if you don't complete one of the puzzles, it bumps you completely out of that chapter and you have to begin again.  Some of the puzzles are just too strenuous and not fun.
1904633293|4.0|It's a lovely book, with gilt-edged pages, the final volume to complete my Jane Austen collection.  I truly like it, though its compact size and small print make it a little harder for me to read.  However, its advantage of being small enough to tuck in my handbag to read in waiting moments is ideal.  I rather like the variety of sizes of my Jane Austen books, in fact, ranging from this one to the large, coffee-table size of the  annotated, illustrated edition of 'Emma'.  I've collected all the DVDs of Jane Austen's works and I like to sometimes follow along in the actual writs to see how accurate the film versions are.  Some are more so than others, making sure that all the historical details and props are 'right on'.  But I've yet to see any film based on Austen's work that I didn't enjoy.  It's just that becoming more aware of the very important roles of the times in which they're set is a vital part of portraying them.  The 'entail', for example, is not always clearly portrayed to be understood by those of us 'across the pond' for whom it would have no recognition or meaning if not very accurately and carefully portrayed in a film.  Other details which make the best of the films outstanding truly contribute to their enjoyment and understanding.  So having the books for comparison is extremely helpful to me!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Except for a couple points this is a fast paced good read. The plot is well established and the end is great. sort of.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|When I realized that Julian Fellowes had written \\"Gosford Park\\" prior to writing \\"Downton Abbey\\", to which I'm addicted, I knew I must see \\"Gosford Park\\"!  I must confess that it is a complicated story and accents are sometimes difficult to follow easily for this Texan, but I've watched it several times, as well as researching the actors with whom I'm less familiar, to know who is who.  The  story is intriguing, the settings elegant and I like that it's set in the 30s, the decade of my birth.  Since Downton is in the teens and  20s, it's a good follow-up, showing the advance of fashions, life-styles and rights for women.  The music is wonderful and exciting that it's based on several of the actual compositions by one of the characters in it, an actual movie star of the 30s, Ivor Novello.  A contrast of the Hollywood characters in the story to the main-character upper-class Britishers is interesting.  It's a good story!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Excellent movie plot...twists and turns.  Matthew and rest of cast were excellent.  A movie you can watch over and over again. I highly recomment.
B0044IABFS|5.0|Totally loved this entire series. Season 4 had a horrible ending, but you can watch the Final Break which fills in a lot of gaps. You have to pay for this episode on Amazon or you can watch it on Netflix for free. Its listed on Netflix as season 4 episode 23. I was sad to see this show come to and end. I could have watched a few more seasons. The suspense and drama kept me on the edge of my seat. Thank God with Amazon Prime I could watch the next episode after a cliff hanger ending. It must have been horrible to have to wait a week or even a year to see what happened next.
B00CE0BJQ8|5.0|A lovely album with songs & feelings from the heart & soul. The melodies, rhythms, lyrics and vibes are just FAB. Thank You Passenger for sharing your art with us.
B00821OX98|5.0|Right from the get go falling skies kept me on the edge of my seat. I love the diversity of characters in the second mass, Tom bring at the top of my favorites. His constant battle with trying to keep the resistance alive to his struggle with keeping the hopes and morale of the civilians high have drawn me further and further into the show. If you are a fan of sci-fi or have enjoyed other underdog type shows you will love falling skies guaranteed.
B000P407K4|5.0|Ok, this is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen.  At the beginning of the movie it goes a little slow, and I almost quit watching it, but was glad I didn't.<br /><br />It has a lot of odd, dry comedy in it.  It is a very twisted movie.
B00CXQL828|3.0|This is iteration #3 of Mike Portnoy's post-Dream Theater game of \\"let's bring together musicians whose careers have almost stalled\\".<br />This record is by no means bad. In fact, Elevate is a really good tune. The problem is, it's a good tune because it could have been a Mr. Big tune. But from there on, for the most part, the album is a Richie Kotzen side project. That can be good or bad, depending on your enjoyment of RK's music.
0800141660|5.0|I loved this movie - it was done so well and was very entertaining. I also liked the bonus content (Emma Thompson's commentary on the movie was both enlightening and funny). The film is almost like a mix between Pride and Prejudice and Much Ado About Nothing. It also features many talented actors before they were very famous. It was so fun to see them all together in one movie!<br /><br />The DVD was in excellent condition, unscratched, and played well.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Huge &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; fan here. This volume is not as good as book three, but much better than four. If you felt like four dragged way too much, don't be afraid to pick the series back up. Things get going again pretty quickly in this one.
159562015X|4.0|This book cuts to the chase. It quickly argues the case for focusing on strengths rather than just weaknesses and then gets you onto it's website to run through the questionnaire that will tell you what your strengths are. After you get your results, you go through the rest of the book that details what your strengths are.<br /><br />I was surprised by its accuracy - I felt that it really coined where my focuses are very easily and helped me to set a direction for a future career path. However, I think that it could do with more of a guide as to how a person with certain strengths makes the most of what they have. There are a few tips, but they could have gone further.<br /><br />That said, if you are looking for some help to understand what drives you, get this book. You'll have answers within an hour.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This is a great game but it just keeps freezing . Every time I go into the game it freezes every 5 to 10 minutes. I will still play but please fix that or try.
B006M9NI48|4.0|OK, it's positive thinking repackaged (that was my take on it), but its powerful stuff. A book like this can really help you to take control of your life and teach you how to attract the things that you want. I recommend it. It's easy to read and instantly applicable - if you want to change your life, this book is one of the places that you can start.
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|Growing up in the 90's this CD and Fiona Apple's CD were in constant rotation. You really couldn't get away from those two back in those days and if you were a girl of about 16 or 17 like me you didn't want to. These women sang what I felt and made me feel like someone, somewhere understood me. Looking back I see how melodramatic it all was but at the time it sure didn't feel like it.<br /><br />The good thing is that this body of music has stood the test of time. In fact listening to it brought back such a huge wave of emotion for me that I was frankly shocked. These songs resonated with adult me just as much and maybe more than they did years ago. There are so songs that I listen to now that I once thought were so profound and now for the life of me I don't get them anymore but you won't find that here.<br /><br />I will say that there are a few times when her voice gets grating but that is just Alanis. I say if you used to love this music back in the day I'm willing to bet you still will. And if you've never listened give it a go. There's more to this CD than just anger and &#34;you oughtta know.&#34;
B00009Z576|4.0|I have always been a classic yes fan as I was hooked on them by albums such as Relayer, Fragile and Close to the Edge. After hearing about this album for years, I found a used great shape copy of this album on vinyl, and let me tell you, it is highly underrated.<br />It is clear from the first Few tracks it is Yes, but not like you have heard them up to that point. It is Yes meets New Wave/80s rock thanks to Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, aka, the Buggels taking the Vocals and Keys over, respectively. The songs have great energy and drive that give the &#34;Senior&#34; members of the band at that point(Squire, Howe and White) to play a little less prog and a bit more Rock, so it feels like, at the time , the band got a new infusion of energy for the 80s. This album points right at where they went next: 90125.<br /><br />Standout tracks: &#34;Tempus Fugit&#34;(GREAT bass groove in this one), &#34;Does it really happen?&#34;(Squire puts another great groove down) and the Epic track &#34;Machine Messiah&#34;.<br /><br />If you are a open minded Yes fan or like some prog in your New Wave, I suggest this one!
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|I don't know what happened but after downloading this app my Kindle starting acting crazy. I thought that the app couldn't be the issue but nothing else had changed. I deleted this and things seem to be okay now. I really don't understand what might have happened and I'm bummed because I really thought this app would be great.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great family movie and I can't wait to get despicable me 2 and watch it with the grandkids (good excuse!!)
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This book offers a look into past history of presidents and their interactions with one another.It also shows how they band together to support the sitting president when needed.  Since it covers quite a bit of past history it is very enlightening.  The good, bad and ugly of each presidency shows forth. I found it very interesting and it gave me a better understanding of our American history.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Best game I have ever played.  I literally could not wait to play and solve the puzzles and complete the levels.  Loved the jewels and timepieces..they made the whole experience so much more challenging.  Beware you won't be able to stop playing!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|my husband loves his smooth voice for somewhere over the rainbow.  rest of songs aren't bad either. i will probably get his other  albums.

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This is an Awesome collection of the Eagles music.  I love these DVDs.  This is the ultimate collection for Eagles fans...
B008JFUNWS|5.0|As a real fan of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series of books, I was somewhat disappointed with the first Percy Jackson movie because it strayed too much from the storyline and didn't have the right group dynamic between the characters.  This second movie is much better, in my opinion, because it really draws you in by following the storyline from the book that made me want to read all seven books (multiple times!).  This movie is great fun, and very exciting, with lots of twists and turns and special effects - I especially like the cab ride!<br /><br />All in all, this movie is extremely enjoyable, and I highly recommend it for the whole family.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Didn't watch it before. Was channel surfing, nothing was on so I went to see what was free to watch on Amazon. I like some of the other USA (network) shows and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did. It's a great show w/a sexy cast. Only problem is that I have to wait a week now for the next episode.
B00CL8D83U|3.0|I have, as always, been looking forward to this latest PSB release.  On the whole I'm happy with it, but not as excited as I had hoped.<br /><br />For me about half the tracks are really nice, beat-driven songs that have an unmistakable PSB sound and feel.  These are primarily composed of the middle set of songs on the CD.  The first and last few do less for me.  In some way the collection of songs do not feel cohesive.  Almost as if they were written at different times or under markedly different circumstances, so there is a disjointed feel to it to my ears.<br /><br />In a few instances I feel like there is a transportation back to the 1980's with updates and it works here, but doesn't work there.<br /><br />I believe if you're a PSB fan you will likely enjoy the CD, but I wouldn't suggest it as being indicative of their better work.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|When viewing media from the USA I am saddened by the overall disgusting characters with little redeeming values in almost every film and series.  This BBC series, as others, still has moral characters to admire, respect, and who develop over time.  Some may describe it as a &#34;Chick flick&#34; type series but it is a balm in the storm of blood, guts, corrupt and disturbed detectives, zombies and vampires.
B0030DIP7E|5.0|If you don't buy this collection of three albums from one of the greatest guitarist of all time for $13.99 then you are crazy. Passion and Warfare alone is worth the price.
B00E4TSNCK|3.0|The monster looks streamlined and believable, the acting is mediocre, the storyline is a combination of other movie story lines but they picked good movies to borrow from.
1781162646|5.0|What more can I say?  I have loved his books since the first Richard Bachman ones.  There is nothing better than curling up with a S.K. book!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book took me by surprise. The characters are amazingly detailed, the plot is fast-paced and engaging, and the world in which it is set is imaginative and fresh. The author uses conventions of the genre in new and unusual ways, and manages to write a story that will be interesting to both fans of sci-fi and readers of general fiction. Excellent!
B00003CXIP|5.0|I had seen this movie years ago and finally decided it had to be mine.  A wonderful story of childhood friends!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I love evanescence and this Cd/DVD collection was perfect! It came in on time and was everything I wanted and expected. Love it!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Story was excellent.<br /><br />Problem was in downloading it. Every 5 minutes it had to reload additional material. Do not have the download problem with Netflix and usually do not with Amazon--just with this particular rental.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|Took me back to the Calgary Stampede and two stepping. incredible performer very happy to have him on my playlist..
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Highly recommend for parents and educators.  Offers great insights into how the process of success is nurtured from early early roots and how those characteristics that are vital are nurtured .... This book deals more with the psychological aspects of the building blocks that must be present for a child to grow into a sucessful adult and lifelong learner....  Highly recommend
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really enjoy this application.  The puzzles start out easy then become complex.  The design's look artful. Overall it is worth trying out.
B004GCKRWO|5.0|Thank you so much for sending the movie in good timing and in such good shape!  That was the only one I needed to make the complete set.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the most popular game out there. There could be some kind of improvement in the game.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I cant live without suits. I need 5 more season after this newest(Season 3) is done.You better deliver. I mean it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie is for all ages. It teaches you to respect other people's jobs what ever it was because every single person is important for the community success.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|It constantly and completely locks up his 4\\" Samsung tablet.  The only way out of it is to do a hard reset and once I ended up having to do a factory reset because it wouldn't boot back up.
B00E8B1358|1.0|There are few movies that I wish I had not watched but this one was right up there. The acting was pathetic, the story absurd, and, except for good explosions, the movie was terrible.
B00CE6E6B2|1.0|I actually really loved this game. Until around March whenever I went to go and play it wouldn't load. It would just say, &quot;Little Big City is not Responding&quot; Then it would close and it left me trying to get in. I was very far in the game. Totally going to delete. Sorry Gameloft.
B0064MGU98|3.0|I like the series and an watching 2 or 3 episodes a night. I enjoy it because it is serious and not frivolous. It does lack humor but that's okay in this case.<br /><br />The acting is fine if just a wee bit over the top. I think the casting is spot on.<br /><br />There is good character development and the stories are complex enough to hold my interest.<br /><br />My only gripe is there is too little focus on the legal cases and too much emphasis on the sneaky backstabbing in and out of the firm.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Love the main theme song. The are OK as well but that is why I bought this CD. Good quality. Worth the $$$.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Most enjoyable. my wife really enjoys it, over and over and over.there is great acting great story lines great direct thing can't wait for The fifth season.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|At first I thought it was going to be lame and cheesy but it turned out way better then I expected!!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works exactly as advertised. This app completely meets all of my alarm clock needs. Really, it does. Buy it. You won't be disappointed.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I'm a Neeson fan. Love the man, and he did well in this role. But the movie itself was marginal. The story was flat and aimless. Irony was in there towards the end but it's not worth a second watch. If you enjoy bloody wolf vs man hunts or a lot of death philosophy/perspectives, go for it.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This was a great price, and an even better deal when I was able to sell it back!  Loved the show, too.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|This was an absorbing book from start to finish. I only gave it four stars because I thought the ending was a bit disappointing. However I would thoroughly recommend it for reading - the same quality as all his books.
B007V693YK|2.0|Bought this for my Galaxy S4 because I have it on my iPad.  The iPad version gives chord sheets and lyrics as well as Tab player but this only has the Tab player.  Not much good for anything at all.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved this book because it was so quirky. Full of humour, intelligence, real life and surprises! Would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.
B007ADJTMK|5.0|Beautifully done film. If you lived in Italy you can really appreciate this films depiction of the simplicity of life and the joys that are Italian.
1402786360|5.0|This book has instructions for learning the basics of baking that every home baker should master. It also has very artistic takes on the classics that are so inspiring!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What did we do without it?<br />Love catching up with friends that I've not heard from in years!<br />Remember, one can always &#34;defriend.&#34;
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I was very happy with all of the explanations on how to write a book for Kindle. Very descriptive and helpful!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is a story told from about ten different points of view - really good, very long, and at times exciting.
B00A27X972|5.0|This book was way out of my typical genre, but the review sounded interesting so I bought it on a lark.  Wonderfully warm story, peppered with dark comedy as well as a few very interesting facts.  Mr. Haig's characters are quite likable and fully developed.  I would highly recommend &#34;The Humans&#34; to anyone, no matter what their preference in fiction.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|We want Candy Crush NOW!! Please get it set up for Kindle. I play it on my computer all of the time. Spent $47 last month on lives and boosters. YIKES!
0525478817|5.0|Every once is a long while, I read a book that sticks with me. It changes the way I think and the way I feel. The Fault in Our Stars was that book for me this summer.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is the story of a 16-year-old cancer patient named Hazel who was literally on her death bed until a miracle treatment saved her. However, she is still terminal; the treatment only bought her more time. A few years later, Hazel meets a boy name Augustus, a former cancer patient, at a support group for kids with cancer. They become friends and the story goes on from there.<br /><br />I loved every second of this book. I loved that Hazel was so honest about everything that she was feeling. She didn't try to dramatize her condition and she didn't pretend to be brave or heroic in any way. Hazel's only goal was to hurt the fewest number of people possible when she died.<br /><br />The author's note at the beginning states, \\"This book is a work of fiction. I made it up. Neither novels nor their readers benefit from attempts to divine whether any facts hide inside a story. Such efforts attack the very idea that made-up stories can matter.\\"<br /><br />This made-up story matters.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|good game to play in spare time but keeps asking to use real money to buy tokens when all I want to do is just play
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun app that your kids can do. Now they own a horse without all the cost and real care. My 6 year old loves cleaning and training his horse.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Piper's book is honest and fascinating. I love the tv series so I read the book, and it also delivers!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent story to read and a great movie. I watched th movie first and found the book easy to read
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|An interesting take on the historical Jesus but little or no mention of some key facts. If James was Jesus' brother what about another virgin birth? And where is the discussion of Mary Magdalene's role and the mother Mary's role in the early Church? There are more questions. But there are also a lot of answers.<br />Finally no mention of Dominic Crossan's The Historical Jesus or the Jesus Seminar. But an interesting read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|as usual, the settings are perfect, the characters well defined, the plot effectively complicated, and the acting fabulous, all this even though nothing more than a soap opera.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Each season gets better and better!!!!  Very enjoyable because always has you wondering when Castle will make his move on Kate.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This app would be so much better without all the errors. Occasionally locks up and needs restarted and has some connection issues but all in all its enjoyable.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I bought this CD & i was NOT Disappointed! Has Good Quality. Not Scratched Plays Well I Really Love it
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy play this game, because it is a fun challenge. It is also cool to snatch my city grow the way I want it too.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Overall a very nice rendition of the theatre version<br />All actors were very good, especially christine<br />Recommend that you see this before your show
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book. I loved this book so much and yet feel unable to find the words to say how much. Written from the POV of Death (who knew Death had synesthesia?) this book lifts you up even as it's breaking your heart. There are so many great lines in this book, \\"For me, the sky was the color of Jews.\\" What a horrible, beautiful line. When I'd read the last line of the book, I sat on my couch crying for I don't know how long. I feel like weeping again, just writing this. I\\"m sorry I'm not very coherent in this review, but if you take away anything from this, it's READ THIS BOOK. I read it on my Kindle, but have ordered the hardcover version, I feel the need to hold it in my hands. That's how much I love this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids play this game and the love it....They love the movie too. It keeps them entertained and laugh for a long time.
B008Q1T1IW|5.0|Vivaldi, Nina SImone, George Benson and EWF--linked seamlessly with Ludovico Einaudi's piano. There isn't a single track that I don't like, but my favorite would have to be Terry Callier's You're Goin' Miss Your Candyman . . . a country funk version of the classic &#34;I know my rider&#34; (Circle round the sun).
B002RI9UBS|5.0|What a beautifully written story. Highly recommended to those with a hankering for the whimsical. I sort of didn't want to know what happened towards the end. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it. Best last line of a novel I've read for a long time.
B00DB31Y3U|4.0|This app is pretty good, I've tried the first one, And it seems to me that the steering has been improved slightly. I have to say though that I love that there is a 3D model of the starcraft II collectors edition
B00DULWFZE|3.0|It is different, and I would expect it to be some different considering how much time has passed. There is not as much harmonizing and seems to focus a lot more on the lead singer, instead. (However, there are a few songs that are more like the classic BSB.) Overall, its a good CD, but just don't go into it thinking you're getting the same BSB as you were getting so long ago.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|I'm not sure why Kindle and Amazon reviews have such a tough time separating out the wheat from the chaff?  This was at best an average read, with a real lack of true character development.  Some of the passages were poorly written and somewhat ham handed.
B000W9399S|2.0|As an adult reader, I wasn't impressed, but I think a lot of kids would like it. The pace seems pretty crazy, but it does have some very nice wit and humor to it. It almost reminded me of something crazy you would see in a cartoon. It would make a good kids' movie. But, it was a tad too wacky for me, and the humor is a lot more word play than anything else. So, if you like that kind of humor, this book is for you!
B003UBTX72|5.0|Whether or not you're a fan of The Stones, Richards' autobiography is a fascinating look into a life that most of us will - thankfully - never have the chance to live.  He survived; many did not.  While I may sound rather disapproving of his lifestyle, I must say I find him a fun character and wonder what he would have been like had he stayed sober his whole career.  He's a hoot as he is now!
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|The icon for the game appeared on my carousel almost immediately after buying it but would never open, so don't waste your time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife says this is a terrific show.  However, she had some difficulty streaming it to watch.  You may wish to purchase, so you don't have to fight for bandwidth.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|A mix of thriller suspense and science fiction, \\"Orphan Black\\" -- which Patton Oswalt raved about -- is one of the most interesting new shows of the season. And probably the least watched, since it isn't on a main network or on a well-known cable channel.<br />Canadian actress Tatian Maslany plays Sarah Manning, a street-smart young woman who has had to hustle just to stay alive and ahead of the bill collectors. Her life is turned upside down when she witnesses a suicide -- a woman jumping in front of a train -- especially since the woman looked like her long-lost twin.  She decides to take her place for a while, in order to take advantage of her money and her lifestyle (nice apartment, etc.).  Big mistake: apparently Sarah's doppelganger was a police detective -- one who seems to have been involved in shady dealings.  Just when it seems Sarah has gotten herself out of one fix -- because of the dealings of her dead doppelganger -- she lands in another pot of hot water.  Worse, Sarah stumbles across evidence of a larger, possibly government-connected conspiracy.  And stumbles across a few more \\"doppelgangers\\".<br /><br />Tatiana Maslany is an _amazing_ young actress: not only does she manage to play different versions of \\"herself\\" (replete with accents that range from cockney to midwestern American to German), but she does it such an expert way that one actually feels as if they are watching completely _different_ actresses playing the parts.  Amazing.<br />And Jordan Gavaris -- as her gay best friend -- is equally impressive.  A lot of new talent in this show!<br /><br />And the first season ends on just the right sort of cliffhanger note.<br />Can't wait for Season two!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time.  If you want to read about romance and action read this.
B003YP7N9O|5.0|Packaging great, classic disc, and 5.1 concert version included. Decent price, to boot. Bringing back great memories of early Tull.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|First book I bought on my kindle but just could not get into it.  Many people really enjoyed it. Maybe I will try again.
B0040I09RM|4.0|I didn't start watching this until after Season 5 had ended; very raw and gritty and definitely a &#34;Hamlet on Harleys&#34;.  This is some kick ass stuff.  Can't believe this show goes out over the air where kids can see it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fast read could not put down.  Never read anything like it before.  Must read if you want some romance. Loved it.
0399245030|5.0|Bought this for our 3 year old grandson's. he picked this one to read over & over again! Can't wait to buy more of Oliver Jeffers books.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read the first two could not wait to get to the third.  If you liked one and two then this one is a must.  Enjoy.
0399255370|5.0|Oliver Jeffers books make great gifts for children. Our grand kids love them! We will be ordering more! Highly recommend all of his books!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I was floored by the previous EP from Of Monsters And Men. Since this CD came out I've hardly gone a week without listening to it. It's a great, easy listen and a personal favourite of mine when driving to combat feeling angry or aggressive. Can't wait for what comes next.
B003UBTX72|1.0|Expected more I guess, but should have known better. Still trying to get through the first half of the book.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I enjoyed this book and it held my interest however, I have read other books by Ken Follett I enjoyed more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was hooked from the first season! The selection of characters is top notch.  They play their roles eloquently. You'll be hooked!
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|What a beautiful album this is. George Benson never fails to amaze me.  Not only does he do justice to the timeless and classic recordings of Nat King Cole, but Benson also places his own imprint on the music to give it a fresh sound.  Many times during all of the songs, I could swear that  Benson channels Nat King Cole, but then I hear his beautiful guitar accompaniment to the arrangement, and I'm back to recognizing Benson's sound.  Love, love, love his rendition of &#34;Mona Lisa&#34;.  In the present era when drum machines, synthesizers, yelling, rapping, wailing take over and cheapen popular music, it is a pleasure and a thrill to listen to an artist who relies on his voice, phrasing, and those virtuoso guitar skills to make something very special.  This is a must-have for any jazz fan, any Nat King Cole fan, and any George Benson fan, and I happen to be all three!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I was completely in love with the characters in these stories. I couldn't put any of them down and I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I would have given it another star except that I thought I was getting the full product I now find that I have to pay 4.99 to receive the full order/I am not a happy comper, i should have been told that this was not a full version
0345529057|4.0|The books are great. I love the story, it's better than the tv series. But the quality of the books is too cheap.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I never watch the series when it was on TV, I got the dvd's from the library. So I was glued to the TV for a few days. At least I didn't have to wait a week to see what happens next. I loved it from the first episode.  Can't wait for season 4.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|If you have enjoyed the Sigma Force series, this is a great addition.  A great continuation that continues the series while adding an interesting and new twist to the Sigma Team's experience.  Worthwhile read.
B0085W09ME|5.0|I don't know why i write review, my brother installed this app, i have not used it even once, but it seem wonderful :-))
B0064MGU98|5.0|Really gets you hooked.  Great characters and story lines.  I recommend it highly.  Love Alicia's character and determination.  Great entertainment
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|Two Brits and two North Americans. Strong cast. Great location and a great script make this a decent film. Will watch it again as the production was good as well.<br />Well done everyone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great book, I listened to the audio version and I was riveted. Great depth of characters and story progression. I found myself thinking about it a lot during the day.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|I was told by friends to read this series, which I am.  It is fairly interesting, but definitely as advertised, a young adult series.  The author does have a wonderful way of keeping things action packed.
B0046H95RM|5.0|This is one of the best by Agatha. Ending is just a masterpiece. Must read if you a mystery fan
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this read!  I love being surprised when a book isn't completely predictable.  I couldn't wait to leave work to come home and finish it!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Smash was a smashing show and dont let anyone else tell you other wise! It just smashes the competition! Smash!
B001B6PBBK|5.0|This was the first  movie that I tried on my Kindle Fire. A great movie with a lot of laughs and other funny things&#62;
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Very good read. Learned a lot about Yemen and the thought process about terrorism and how to combat it.  Excellent book for people concerned about security of U.S.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|-Like the screen &amp; crispness of numbers.<br />-When you tap a number to see the spaces occupied by same number, not all spaces containing that number light up.<br />-speed at which you can enter new numbers limited while you wait for obligate &quot;ping&quot; &amp; allowing occasional number gyrations. Irritating when trying to improve your best time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun challenging game. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! I like it better than temple run its more involvement n changes of scenery and obstacles
B0042RUMIW|5.0|Get this it is the best concert ever... Even if your not a Sting fan you will be when you see this dvd
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I download this for my son but I really enjoy playing it myself. I just wish it was easier to up grade the suits.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|This movie was so Awesome and it had a great plot I also liked how the main character was cool in the end.
B00A0R42L6|3.0|My son loves it but doesn't get to watch because unless I am connected to the internet he can't watch it....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. the more you play the more you get sucked in. great past time. I like seeing your friends score when you connect to FB and see you pass them.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|My Mom had this book and she gave it to me.  I still have the hard copy but wanted to read it again during my downtime at work.  Very well written and enjoyable to the end.  This book is hard to put down.  If you like the Bourne books, you will enjoy this one.
B005DZMP00|5.0|Excellent live performances of classic Dead Music.  Absolutely recommend to anyone looking to fill-out their collection of the Grateful Dead.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|The main character in this book was not one I liked.  She didn't think and really made poor decisions.  I don't think I would like to read her other books.
0975991477|4.0|great primer in cell biology--also presents a solid core message (via lucid description of quantum physics) that we are energy based, not matter based--readable and informative
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was really great season. I was not able to stop myself from watching it in one sitting. I cannot wait for the next one. I wonder how will they continue it.
055358202X|2.0|so disappointed in this series. the writer is obviously very good, yet it's almost like there are continual disconnects. characters disappear. one chapter about a character is interesting, then the character doesn't show up again for so long you've forgotten what their story is. and there is never any sense of an underlying syngery or energy building. just discrete stories one after another with very little linking. then suddenly someone is killed--ok done with that one. i am skimming big parts and wishing that somewhere it all started to come together. what a shame--had such potentia
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is the documentation of a recording studio that shaped the careers of many of our favorite artists. History is important and this tells the story of the legendary Neve board and all the people who did what they did for love of the music. Very well done and the sound track is superb.

B000FGGE68|5.0|Visually this is a treat to watch. Lots of intense primary colors, fantastic special effects and amazing stunts. Lots of time and effort by some of the best in all areas of movie making pays off in a big way.
055357342X|2.0|so disappointed in this series. the writer is obviously very good, yet it's almost like there are continual disconnects. characters disappear.  one chapter about a character is interesting, then the character doesn't show up again for so long you've forgotten what their story is.  and there is never any sense of an underlying syngery or energy building. just discrete stories one after another with very little linking. then suddenly someone is killed--ok done with that one.  i am skimming big parts and wishing that somewhere it all started to come together.  what a shame--had such potential.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This has been our families favorite show to watch together. It will be interesting to see where the next season takes our group of survivors and what new characters the new season will bring to the forefront.
B0000TAZYM|5.0|Wow!  Perfection.  Perfectly engineered.  Takes a good-excellent system to appreciate.  Never gets old.  I'm not sure this is the best surround album but the 24 bit/48khtz sound is VERY good.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoyed the book and really breezed through it and then I was left hanging in mid air.  Very disappointing.
B006QVRUS2|2.0|this film has one theme:  children are probably more civilized than their parents.  That's it.  It is not explored, it is only shown through multiple examples of lightly escalatingly crappy behavior as 2 sets of parents argue with eachother.  Certain elements of the film seem to be comic in nature  (puking, using the bathroom, making fun of Jodi Foster, Jodi Foster getting really mad, Jodi Foster being a lousy cook, John C Reilly being goofy), but instantly wear thin because there's no irony to give the quasi-funny stuff any sort of contrast.<br /><br />I like movies where characters clash verbally.  I love Doubt, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Dangerous Liasons, etc.  But those films are about revealing something other than ridiculousness and pettiness.  I love Roman Polanski, but this feels like the most phoned-in work he's done.<br /><br />Maybe the film loses something in being translated for a foreign language and from being a play.  Maybe it's meant to be strictly existential in outlook.  Maybe it's meant to be unengaging.<br /><br />If that's true, then it's a success.  But I can't recommend it.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|it actually works. the deadzone calibration is so far the best among many product i have tried.<br />my disappointment is that it ties the right analog stick permanently to mouse movement, making it only good for FPS games.<br />and also you can not assign one button with two keys.<br />and it only support non wireless keyboard and mouse. Now I am having this cable jungle piled in front of my PS3.<br />Sounds like they are making a new device for ps4 and new firmware would be better. but that does not help me having bought this device already. They just want to keep making money instead of helping out customers.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a wonderful way to see how the uppercrust live(d), and become so involved in each character's daily life - the upstairs unbelievably wealthy family, contrasted with the poor and overworked downstairs workers who kept the mansion running in perfect order each day.  I grew to feel like I knew each character, as each individual was brought to life in every episode, and I found it hard to wait to see what was going to happen next.  Very well done, and reminescent of one of my favorites, &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34;.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|This book hooked me early and kept me wanting to read more. The plot unfolded with unexpected twists. Very well written.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Neither of the two sequels are as good as the first book, but once they get to the final action sequence, it picks up a lot of steam.  Still a good read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Enough history and culture and ample storyline to wrap it all together.  Loved it.  Would recommend for all readers.  Not violent.
B002APU580|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I rarely even watch period movies, but this one caught my attention soon after the movie started. I will watch it again
B00003CXCS|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother.  One of her (and my) favorite movies!  It was well received.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I ordered it for my PC and it kept saying I had ordered it, but it didn't show up in my movie list and I could not find it anywhere.  I tried to call customer service, but the movie rental associates never picked up my &#34;live chat&#34; conversation.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I wish that there were less computer players bots. Other than that it us fun.  I would recommend download . Have a good day
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|It was just a cute movie and I really enjoyed it. A great ending and would watch again. I remember her in a Christmas movie I also enjoyed it very much.
B004YRSBTW|5.0|fast paced....complex.... Im already to watch it again and I NEVER watch movies more than once. Highly recommended but make sure you take notes!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Don't get this app!! Waste of my time! It is VERY disorganized, and/or out of order It has a very sloppy, tacky, and out of style design to it I HIGHLY suggest that you NOT get this app for if you do, you will be disappointed!
0062238868|5.0|My 16 year old grandson loved it.  Wants a military career.  Great book.  Would recommend it for teen age boys and adults.

B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|My 7 year old loved it so I downloaded the full version then not long after it said I had to reload the game.  We have not yet...hope I do not have to pay to get full version.  We loved that game and it just may not be compatible with my Cruz tablet. Hope it works such a fun game!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|A new take on an old story, complete with technology and a little sci-fi thrown in!  Be sure to read Scarlett by the same author. Both are great reads!  Greatly recommend!

B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The story line is good. The movie, I have seen over and over and over. Just with different titles. Exciting at first! Boring after about 45 minutes.
B000FC146C|5.0|The book is better than the movie.  It is more detailed and entertaining.  It keeps your attention throughout the book.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Great character development, good plot, and wonderful acting. Personally I am sick of the action genre and the super quick CGI action scenes. Finally a great movie with substance.

1400154227|5.0|. . . which is saying something, given the author's stunning productivity. In this novel the veteran human + robot detective team of The Caves of Steel (also highly recommended) travel to Solaris, strangest of the worlds colonized long ago by Earth. Their attempts to discover &#34;whodunit&#34; are confused by a society in which humans are few and far between, compared to their ubiquitous robot servants. How could anyone commit murder when real people almost never meet? More important, is the human race doomed to extinction as each of us retreats into a private heaven? A nice combination of thoughtfulness and characterization.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book holds your attention from start to finish. Most intriguing book, an interesting Summer read. Well written, and very descriptive.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great actors, good story lines, keeps you on the edge of your site! In tune with current or recent events as human behavior does not change
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Fast action packed book. I highly recommend anyone to read this. I love this series of stories. I have read others and seen all four movies. The book's story is not like the movie.  Both are very well written.  I will read all the series of Jason Bourne book's.

B009GEYX5E|1.0|Used a brand new Polaroid instant OneStep camera.<br />I put the pictures in a black box for several hours after taking each photo.<br />The pictures quality is terrible.<br />Going to ask amazon for a refund. Huge waste of money.<br /><br />Just check out the official website. Users upload photos that they have taken with this film.<br />They all look like CRAP. [...]<br />I wish I would've reviewed that first, I would of never wasted the $25.
B00004CXMW|5.0|I am 55 years old and I still enjoy the looney tunes. I will always remember waking early Saturday morning and turning on bugs bunny and his friends.  So if you want to remember your childhood. This is a good movie to start with.
1439152810|2.0|Compelling first few pages made me hope of more of same. Slow moving and so annoying I can't finish it as none of the characters are compelling or interesting enough to find out what happens.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is one of many great movies I have found on Amazon.com. I wish I could tell you about everyone of them but I can't. But if you are looking for a lot of great movies then be sure to.check-out Amazon.com thank you
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I guess I'm a Facebook fan. I haven't been on Twitter really long enough to critique it. I do like the short 'tweets' and I can scroll through and get the important news headlines, weather, health info etc. I think if more of my friends used Twitter I would definitely like it better!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Started off a bit slow but the more you get into it the better it is very hard to put down
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I watched this movie with my kids and have to say we all enjoyed it! There was a few things I kept waiting on to happen that didn't be hey that is what made it so intense. :)
B007TK77QE|5.0|Loved it, well written, great characters, story line is clever, sad, wise, insightful and funny. Bring on the next one soon,
B005KAH7QU|4.0|Movie is ok quality of streaming movie to my tv is poor. Will try renting additional movies to see what happens
1781162646|5.0|As someone with more than a strong affinity for classic &#34;Family&#34; amusement parks, I am hard pressed to know how I could have enjoyed this book more.  I adored the details surrounding the kind of classic summer job that seems to define a person's youth - here it is an amusement park, but for me it was a movie theater.  Paired with those distinct moments are a &#34;Summer of '42&#34; romance, a brutal crime, a ghost story and a great mix of nostalgia and quirks that seem to define people that run tourist destinations like &#34;Joyland.&#34;  While I have not read Stephen King since his early short story collections, I am overjoyed that both the amusement park setting and the favorable Entertainment Weekly review encouraged me to read this terrific book!
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|Very poor movie, streaming quality to tv is very poor. I would not recommend this movie to any one at all
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Helen Hunt was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in this role and it was well deserved. The Sessions tells the story of a man who is confined to an iron lung who is determined, at age 38, to lose his virginity. With the help of his sexual surrogate therapist (Ms Hunt) and the guidance of his priest, he sets out to make his dream a reality. The story is poignant and uplifting, however, be warned that it is also extremely graphic.  There is not one inch of Ms Hunt's nude body that you will not see and the subject matter is all about his sexual quest.  If you are okay with that it is an excellent film.
B000I9U972|5.0|You just want to keep watching ... Funny at times ... Definitely must try to watch it.  If you see it all the way through, keep watching through the credits!
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|A fast paced sci fi adventure series based on the terminator movies.  Entertaining, with a storyline and plenty of action that can hook you.  Acting is mixed - the Sarah Conor character seems miss-cast (but attractive :&#62;).  If you're looking for sci fi series to watch through on amazon prime, this one can keep you interested.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This is the second CD of this same name. Visiting friend from foreign country never heard this group before. She loved it so it is hers in her own country. I love it so I bought another one.
B00006879E|5.0|This is a really great CD if you like Maroon 5's music. It is some of their older music like &#34;This Love&#34; and &#34;She Will Be Loved&#34;.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|This story was very well written and compassionately tells a story of current and relevant conflicts in todays political climate.  It hit close to home as I identified with the main character in many ways. I loved the surprise ending of the story!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|if you are looking for a literature work of art...you are in the wrong sections.  If you are looking for a book that pulls you into the story and the opportunity to feel vested in the characters' relationship and storylines--this series is for you!  If you were to put the hot sensual scenes off to the side...I would enjoy the story just as much.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|While I'm not a fan of the pencil &amp; paper Sudoku, I LOVE this version of the game. It's not tedious. The easy note and highlighting features help make number choices and decisions very clear. I can focus on the logic of the game. It's fun and addictive for even a non-Sudoko person like me! Try it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pinterest.  So glad there is a Kindle app now!  I can waste tons op time scrolling around the pins!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|The reason I give this four stars is because although it is a good app, Amazon should just include it. After all we did pay for the tablet.. Would recommend this app to people who don't like over complex apps as well. It is very easy to access and go to where you need quickly. The app also takes very high quality photos which is awesome. Hope this helped, thanks for taking the time to read. :)
1400069289|4.0|Very good book about the power habits have over our lives.  Lots of great information and interesting case studies.  I recommend it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My USB Cable for my Kindle died and I needed a replacement.  Amazon graciously sent me a replacement at no cost to me!  Can't beat that!  It arrived quickly and customer service personnel were easy to work with.  Thanks a million!
B001AEF6IQ|5.0|This television show will change your life! Filmed in Cardiff Wales, it weaves the tale of an amazing group of people battling for the safety of the earth. Outside the government, and under the water-tower, John Barrowman's character: Captain Jack will save you the view, as well as the entire earth.
B008LH4YYC|4.0|I like this app. I use it all the time to kill apps that stay active in the background, these cause my tablet to hang unexpectedly.
0316187216|5.0|This book is awesome. I would read it again if I hadn't just read it for a second time. Go out and buy it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The only thing that I have to wish for is burn bans. Otherwise, anything you want to look for in weather,is here! I love this app!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been disappointed by most of the SF I've been reading lately.  They all seem to start with good concepts, but either fade to lackluster finishes, or just come to abrupt stops...waiting to be continued in the next book.  I purchased \\"Wool\\" anticipating another mediocre read. Surprise!!!  What I got was an original story with characters I cared about, living in a completely unique world.  I was hooked at the conclusion of part one, 'Holston'.  A great short story all by it's self.  I found 'Wool' to be a wonderful read with a satisfying conclusion, even though so many of my questions went unanswered.<br />I am currently close to finishing the second book in the Silo Saga, 'Shift'.  More really good stuff.<br /><br />'Wool' has become a standard, along with Arthur C. Clark's \\"Childhood's End\\" and Ray Bradbury's \\"Martian Chronicles\\", by<br /> which I will measure all my future reads .
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Who knew that there could even better reads than &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; or &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;?  He just keeps getting better!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|My husband has wanted this cd for years. Now he won't stop playing it. Excellent quality. Just what we ordered.
1616202416|4.0|Combines the intergenerational cultures of old time African culture with the changes that come with more modern influences in Nigeria.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|If you love smart science fiction and hate the dumbing down or poorly thought out JJ Abrams style sci-fi mysteries, Orphan Black is the series for you! Every single detail comes back or is important in this tightly plotted show. Tatiana Manslany is so fantastic as the main characters you forget the parts are being played by one actress. My new favorite TV show right behind Justified.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|How much more fun can you get??  Little bunnies hopping around. So cute.  Save them! Sort of like that penguins computer game from awhile back...  and super granny
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this collection thinking I was only getting the Blu-ray editiion. However, much to my surprise each disc came with a ton of extra features and a choice of watching the original version of the movie or the most updated versions with additional content. Very pleased. Awesome series.
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|I really dislike timed games because I try to play in order to relax and the timed games always set me on edge.  Either way, I decided to give this a try and honestly I just think it's stupid.  I can see how people would get addicted to it, it's a super simple concept like those bubble pop games.  I think it's the feeling of being under attack and having to manage multiple spots on the &#34;board&#34; that I dislike.
B002LAM7PI|2.0|Coraline is a movie about a child dissatisfied with her home life.  She finds a better place supposedly only to realize it is not really that great.  The theme is pretty creepy even for an Adult.  My 10 was uncomfortable with it.  Puppet mom turn scary spider with controlled puppet people.  It is implied in the beginning that a child dies and goes from there.  It is more like a child version of Stephen Kings IT.  No gore but really creepy.
0061537969|4.0|Good book, I enjoyed it. There are a lot of good dog books that are out for us dog lovers.
1781162646|5.0|This book was different from Stephen King's other books, being a mystery more than a horror tale. The characters were well done, the plot kept me reading and the ending was a surprise.
0785125965|3.0|What would happen if you made Hulk invincible and have him beat up the entire Marvel universe? Well, not the entire, but some big names<br />That's basically the premise of the comic. This book is the culprit of discussions like 'Hulk can beat Superman and Goku combined' while it's clearly just a 'what if' scenario. Story is pretty flimsy, Hulk loses wife (ew) and wrongfully blames Reed Richards and co, he comes to earth with some space freak groupies and battles them. Graphics are good, that glorious 90's feel and sense of action is there, the dialogue balloons are pretty lame though.<br />A good but overrated comic that gave Hulk character a boost.
0525478817|5.0|My daughter had to read a book for summer assignment and this was a great pick. She loved the story that I had to read it as we'll. It was so touching.
B001QJUX24|5.0|Shows a little of the Dukes dark side in this movie. A very young Natalie Wood is in there all so. A very good movie for the duke fan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game in the amazon appstore. You should buy it because it is worth the money. (And if you ever get on realms plz invite me. My minecraft name is Imma_CHOCOHOLIC ) you should buy this app. I recommend it. There are so many different things to do!
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|Game is great fun to play. However there are a couple of bonus levels that I still can't figure out how to defeat. The instructions could be better, but the game is definitely fun!
B00AO686MY|5.0|This is a timeless classic and a pioneer in its field. Anyone who likes a good laugh would love this one.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I got this book with whispersync! It was awesome to listen and read alternately and simultaneously. The characters are lively and likable, especially Oberon, the hound. As a hound mom myself, they got it right on. I now look forward to the rest of the series....as soon as possible!
B009MF56GC|5.0|I am action and this is tops! The combination of stars is great in it self. classic action with just enough comedy.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Logan's run is one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen. It's also wildly imaginative. It features very diverse and colorful settings, from the city's interior (which looks like a futuristic Las Vegas to me), to freaky night clubs, to sewers, to an arctic freezer, to...well, I won't spoil the rest. The film plays out like a very long episode of the original Star Trek series, but with way more nudity (in one nutty scene Logan and Jessica are accosted by a band of naked people); I honestly don't know how they got away with a PG rating. I don't normally like anything campy, but it definitely works for this movie.<br /><br />As for the acting...well, Logan's Run doesn't exactly set a new bar here. Several scenes in the movie are unintentionally funny due to the actors' reciting their lines weird. I don't know what went wrong with Farrah Fawcett's character, but she comes across as mentally impaired during a scene that's supposed to be serious.<br /><br />In my opinion, though, it's all part of the film's charm. You can't really take Logan's Run seriously, but that's OK. And at the end of the day, you get a memorable sci-fi movie with classic memes such as \\"Life day! Renew!\\"
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie is very enjoyable; I would recommend everyone should watch it at least once if they enjoy fast action movies.
0140120416|5.0|I used this book myself as a supplement to my Russian courses at the state university and found it very helpful. This is the third copy I have purchased as gifts for friends and now for my daughter who is studying Russian. Highly recommended for beginners & those learning Russian on their own as an excellent starting point.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Easy to follow directions. Just read and follow step by step and your book is up and published in to time..
B0001AVZA8|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever.  Love the scenery...the beach house, the Hamptons, Paris.  Truly a romantic comedy...funny and heart warming.  How can you go wrong with Jack and Diane!

B006LSZECO|5.0|Fantastic read. Couldn't put the book down because I was dying to get to the bottom of the mystery. . A nail bitter.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I have only played this a couple of times. I got it when it was free a few days ago. I like it. It's a lot like tetris.
B00AEFYK5M|5.0|This film has been reviewed by reviewers.  ESL students love it, especially when they can read the novel after viewing the film.
B001E75QH0|5.0|This collection is a must have. Bought it as a gift for my husband and the kids love it too. Great set to sit as a family together and watch.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept my attention.  Could hardly wait to come back to it  when I had something else to do.  Definitely would recommend this book.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Actually I tried to purchase Gary Taubes book Good Calories Bad Calories but for some reason Why we get fat came up as the suggestion, so without hesitation, I purchased the kindle edition.  Let's just say this is one of the most compelling books on weight loss and management I've read thus far which I've found to be a thoroughly convincing read.  As a part of my journey to better wellness, I've been purchasing a number of books on the subject of weight loss\management and wellness. I really have sought to understand in far more detail why I'm showing signs of metabolic syndrome and what I can do to fix my problem without popping pills proscribed by a doctor and or spending hours in the gymnasium thrashing myself.<br />So far this is the best book I've read in terms of the information presented and I've re-read it three times, taking a number of notes to guide my own approach to my journey.  Having read the book I think I'm actually far better armed to make informed dietary changes that will lead to far better levels of wellness. The author, in his book supports a paleolithic approach to eating but for very good reasons.  The science, the way the argument is constructed, and the information presented is difficult to refute if you're the average lay reader.  If you're not convinced after reading the book then take a look around and see how big the population is becoming. The anecdotal and empirical evidence regarding conventional wisdom on dietary advice is simply not working.<br />I have become an advocate for removing starch and sugars from diets but I've found many people still are grounded in the calorie in, calorie out concept.  For these people who want to lose weight they think the solution lies in exercise and the gymnasium, like I once did.  Truth be told, the solution lies in educating the top two inches of the brain.  With that in mind the first thing I tell anybody who is really serious about making positive changes in their live in order to loss weight is to read, and read extensively so they understand the science.  That way they can make informed choices about what they do and don't do and then understand the cause and effect of their choice.  I would definitely and without reservation, recommend Why we get fat and what to do about it as the start point in a life long journey of change for the better.
B00316DDUE|5.0|I have been a long time waiting for this to come out on Bluray and it was well worth the wait.
0307949508|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Read all three of this series.  Out of the ordinary character who intrigued me.<br />Loved it.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|We were lucky enough to see this show in NYC and loved it. The cast is phenomenal so of course we wanted to OBC recording. The songs are fun, and mostly uptempo, and give you a good sense of the story. Plus it's great music to work out or house clean too.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Since I started with #3 in the series, I decided to go back to the first to get to know the characters.<br /><br />I'll put in a more detailed review soon, but really the author doesn't leave much to be desired in this book if you're a fan of the genre. Action, suspense, thick unpredictable plots, well defined characters... the list goes on.<br /><br />It's how these types of books should be written, highly recommended.
B0012DW6W4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It isn't available anywhere else online and it's one of my favorites. John Malkovitch is excellent and this is just erotic enough while still being a witty drama :)
B000244FDW|5.0|this too was redone comercially from a BBC , color videotape which we had.  My wife found that there were some parts in the dvd that were NOT in the videotape, which made the dvd more interesting.  All aspects of the dvd were excellent.
B00AG297GK|4.0|THe movie was funny. Don't take it too serious and you will have a good time. Sacha Baron Cohen is funny
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Lots of blood flows in the Game of Thrones...but despite my sometimes asking, \\"Why am I watching this?\\"  I had to watch every night for the whole series.  My husband and I are looking forward to getting the DVDs of the Third Season (out in Feb 2014).  The acting is superb, the sets amazing and the tragedy and triumphs are stirring.  The script is well written, making you care about the characters.  I love the drama of heroes, monsters, agony and ecstasy.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is no SIM city but it is a cool game nonetheless (especially for free). The location it starts you at is a little annoying in terms of expansion but over all out is fun so far
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This clock wakes me up every morning and tells me the time.  I  am sure to be on-time, whether it is church or work.  I love it. The display, sound and everything about it.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Good chick flick even a guy can enjoy!  Very much worth a watch.  Sandra Bullock plays her tough exterior but softie role well as in The Blind Side.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Great cover for its use. A little heavy but nicely made ! Style is classy I know my kindle is protected
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Rothfuss spent many years writing and rewriting this first book in the Kingkiller Chronicles, and it really shows in the finished product. With vibrant and compelling characters, an epic coming-of-age story, and a very tantalizing plot structure, I cannot recommend this book enough to fans of the fantasy genre.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love it!  Easy to use easy to read numbers and love the sounds available!<br />Would recommend this to all my friends!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I got this for my 10 y/o son so the family can have nerf wars!!!! Of course he has the best Blaster and we get pelted! I purchased the upgrade kit to give him 4 more cartridges and darts because the Blaster only comes with 4 to begin with, and it holds 8! I also purchased extra darts that also fit our nerf guns! So when we are blasting each other we can all refill without any problems!
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|the film doesn't even try to work. it relies too much on nostalgia and spx to capture it's audience and leaves all sense of character in the dust
B004XANKVO|5.0|Best laptop pack I have ever own. There's enough room in the pack for laptop, tablet, camera, cables, & a change of clothes. Perfect for an overnight flight.
B0026IWNZ4|4.0|This is a cute family movie, especially for kids who are animal lovers. I rented it for my 3 and 7  year old boys thinking that my youngest would be the most interested. He lost interest about half way through.  My older son really enjoyed it. This movie reinforces the importance of loyalty and friendship.
B00867GHS8|5.0|very good film with cute story very colorful and photographic with under water scenes good buy for the money love it
0553381687|4.0|A Game of Thrones is basically review-proof; the series already has a large fanbase that continues to grow due to the HBO series. This is a more \\"realistic\\" fantasy, set in a world not unlike medieval Europe; magical creatures are largely considered myths or extinct. With the more grounded world-building also comes the more unpleasant aspects of the society; there are depictions of brutal battles, torture, executions, incest, and rape.<br /><br />The story follows the Stark family, feudal lords of the northernmost part of the realm. Patriarch Eddard Stark is tapped by the current king to serve as the \\"hand,\\" in essence taking care of the day to day aspects of governing the realm. While at court, Eddard soon discovers a conspiracy that may have been orchestrated by the power-hungry Lannister family. Meanwhile, Daenerys, the last princess of the recently deposed Targaryen dynasty, finds herself in an arranged marriage overseas to a powerful nomadic leader as her brother schemes to take back the throne for himself.<br /><br />In many ways this a subversion of most fantasy stories; a heroic major character fails in his task partly due to his or her own trusting nature. A young girl's dreams of being a princess are shattered by a harsh reality where she is faced instead with a cruel, brutal prince. The story ends with multiple factions preparing for war amongst themselves, unaware of a possibly worse supernatural threat.<br /><br />Although the story may seem bleak at times, there's a lot of intriguing stuff that make me want to keep reading. A massive wall of ice exists to keep unknown threats out of the realm, which includes a supernatural force of animated corpses. There are some pretty memorable characters, such as snarky dwarf (a human, not the fairy0tale kind) Tyrion, and Eddard's rebellious daughter, Arya. Martin's world-building is also top-notch, and definitely succeeds at creating a believable universe for these characters. I will definitely be reading the next book.book.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|dvd is very entertaining and dramatic. has very good story and dialogue and loved every minute of it. excellent buy.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel landing the plane is worth seeing the whole movie for!  Later scenes are a little preachy for me, but Denzel's performance is excellent, as always. Plus John Goodman shows once again why he is a national treasure.
1781162646|5.0|A murder mystery ghost story that takes place in an amusement park written by Stephen King and dedicated to Donald Westlake.  What more can I say?  Have fun.
B004AQR29C|5.0|Easy Cheeky but good  Waiting to see the next one  Sly big boy testosterone best and good back up crew.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Another grandson-friendly game (he is 3.5 years old), color, action and sounds are excellent.  Can't wait for the movie to come out, might be the first I take this grandson to see.
B002JXICCY|5.0|I would definitely recommend this product to all those Led Zeppelin lovers.  Great songs, great live footage of the band.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Magic Academy is a really great game. I was really hooked on it. It took me less than five days to finish it. I really loved that it was not finding hidden objects but that you also had to put thing together and make something work. The storyline was good. I will definitely be looking for more games from Nevosoft.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Exciting and funny.The humor was random, but great timing..Fun to watch a woman kick butt...watched more than once. I. Would recommend.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This a great album! My entire family loves it, and we can't help but to blare it in the car. Brent's voice is better than ever, all of the band members are. It's amazing! Thank you SHINEDOWN !
B004S3MB2U|2.0|Won't run unless you have an internet connection. Pretty useless in a lot of the places I'd need it. Back to RealCalc.<br />BTW, if you must have DRM, use the install process to lock that particular installation to a device's IMEI. You can encrypt a necessary section of code with the IMEI, decrypt at runtime, result is a harder to pirate app that actually can run when the user doesn't have internet.<br />At a minimum, put &quot;needs Internet to run&quot; in the description.<br />PS: it's a really, really good calculator program. Just not useable much of the time. 5 stars foor a great app, minus 3 for bad DRM.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was so inspiring and eye opening. Old as I am, had never heard of this part of history. This was so well written and I would highly recommend it.
B00DB31Y3U|3.0|Helidroid 3D: Episode 2 has great potential. It's a very attractive app. I normally don't play games with vehicles and I'm not very good at them but I think I could enjoy this one if I could master the controls.<br /><br />However I did look at this app in Google Play Store. It is free in the Play Store but it's also a slightly different version that contains ads. There were no ads in the FAOTD version in the levels I played. Thank you, Amazon.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett does a great job of transporting the reader back to the WWI era. The book is a wonderful escape into the past.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a cool app I use it when I'm bored so yeah cool app I need more words words words
B004132I20|5.0|Superb modern adaptation of the Conan Doyle classics.  The cinematography is beautiful with each scene brilliantly crafted.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are an excellent Holmes-Watson duo.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is easy to use, and it is quite efficient. It does what it says. Very effective and free app. It is a worthwhile app to have.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A fantastic book with many twists but easy enough to follow. Just loved it. You got to read this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have always used a calculator app on any device, as looking for a calculator is a big hassle. This one is very easy to use, and is the most effective and user-friendly I have seen so far.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ITS REALLY FUN AND ADDICTIVE.! I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO HAS KIDS. ITS LIKE TEMPLE RUN MIXED WITH JETPACK JOY RIDE
B0074MZSWW|2.0|Only one good song on entire Cd, the last one.  Heard the group  play on movie, CD is nothing like the movie song
B004XZR63M|5.0|It changes your life style and financial thinking<br />I recommend it for everyone who want to be financially strong and smart
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Minion Rush Is a great game for kids who loved despicable me and despicable me 2. It has many different challenges. I think it is a great game!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|works perfectly. The levels are fast and I haven't had any issues with the app. which is great if you ask me!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game and the multiplayer is even better. The game is easy to understand and get into. Great game!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A good retelling of a true story of hostages escaping Iran back in the years of President Carter. Well acted, good sequencing, by people who wanted to pay tribute to the brave people involved.  The hostages had escaped from the embassy to a &#34;neutral&#34; location, but were far from safe, needing a rescue.<br /><br />Like most movies, some characters were combined, some dialog was invented, some complexities were simplified.  For my wife and I the most obvious fictionalization came near the end when dramatic formula demands a tension-release climax.<br /><br />SEMI-SPOILER ALERT -----<br /><br />The movie was made for U.S. consumption. An important part of Canada's help IS shown, but I can't help believe there was a stronger role than that.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Tm hanks is great as multiple characters in the movie, but I cracked up at the broken English they spoke in the future settings. Reminded me of my kids talking with each other while they play.
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|\\"We're the Millers\\" (2013 release; 109 min.) brings the story of how David (played by Jason Sudeikis) a small-time drug dealer, gets robbed of his cash and stash one day, and in order to make up for it, his drug lord (played by Ed Helms) orders him to go into Mexico and bring back a \\"smidgen of weed\\" (which turns out to be hundreds of pounds). David dreams up a disguise, and hires (ex-)stripper Rose (played by Jennifer Aniston) (Rose: \\"you can't buy me!\\" David: \\"I'm not buying you, I'm hiring you!\\"), Casey (played by Emma Roberts), and Kenny (played by Will Poulter) to be his pretend wife and kids. Off they go in a humongous RV, and as sure as night comes after day, this becomes a road trip from hell. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments: this is one of the better comedies I've see in a long time, one that is actually FUNNY. But beware, it is also quite raunchy, so if that is not your thing, you'll want to stay away (it is rated R for a reasons). Also, this is very much a road movie, and you can't help but make the comparison with Chevy Chase and his \\"National Lampoon's Vacation\\" movies, and actually \\"We're the Millers\\" compares quite nicely. The movie contains a bunch of one line zingers that just about had me up in stitches. At one point the whole family is arguing about something and David screams: \\"I am Marky Mark and you all are the Funky Bunch! I am the boss\\", ha! The movie really hits pay dirt when the Miller family gets to know another family, the Fitzgeralds, with Don and Edie as the parents. Nick Offerman as the 'straight' man is just brilliant. There is, however, one scene in the movie that fell completely flat, namely when Rose has to prove to the bad guys that she once was a stripper, and hence busts out a stripper routine that is straight from Flashdance. I mean, does Aniston really have to do this still? Unnecessary, and not funny.<br /><br />That aside, this is what I would call 'formulaic Hollywood' at its best: lots of funny scenes, and mindless entertainment from start to finish. The movie ends in a way that we could definitely get another visit on the big screen from the Millers in a few years. To which I say: sign me up! Enjoy, everyone, it's Miller time!ide, this is what I would call 'formulaic Hollywood' at its best: lots of funny scenes, and mindless entertainment from start to finish.

B0011EU0NG|5.0|I've been watching this as kid and I want to share it with my kids.  How can you not love Dick Van Dyke?
3551551677|5.0|It's a classic children's book and the series is loved by so many.  This is a great way for a parent, or in my case, grandparent to teach a child a new language or at least introduce them to it!  I adore the Harry Potter books and the fact they can teach our children as well as broaden their minds is such a bonus.  In my mind, and heart, I will NEVER outgrow this book series.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I absolutely love \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" even though it bears little resemblance to any hospital I know. Seattle does NOT have constant thunderstorms--thunder is a rare occurrence. None of these mistakes, however, spoil my enjoyment of the show. It has sent me to the internet many times to learn more about obscure medical conditions. Sandra Oh is like watching an acting Master Class! This is high quality soap opera at its very best!
B008PZYZH6|2.0|This film has lots of action and special effects, but the plot is not very well explained or developed.  Great if you like action without much else.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What an intriguing use of technology. It really made me think.  I enjoyed every single mysterious moment of this game! I can't wait for the next ROOM!
B001U3ZMHW|3.0|The AT-AT walker was not stable.  Kept falling over.  The building at the hinges was not quite right on one side.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I've seen Lindsey on Utube, she is amazing! So then I had to have her CD.  I play it all the time....she is so talented, writing her own music, dancing while she plays, great costumes, and she is so sweet and humble. You have to check her out and enjoy this great talent!
0385341008|5.0|A fun read that also contains some interesting background information on the role of Guernsey during WWII. Easy, fun read.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Read James Altucher. He makes sense. You will see things differently. I loved this book. I read it and have recommended it to my children and friends.
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|Our 3 y/o son loved the original movie cars and was excited to get Cars 2.  He was a bit bored with this movie and asked for his original movie. He watched Cars 2 a few times, but much prefers the 1st.  There were some cute humor jokes most children will miss that seem to be there for the adults watching.
0425252868|5.0|Great book, hard to put down.  Recommended for adults, some mild adult themes at times.  A different view point of WWII
B008BSOAPE|3.0|not as good as his other books, only ok as far as my 14 year old daughter thought after she read it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Down loaded this for my kindle fire and have thoroughly enjoyed playing it, yes there is an add before every new game but you just cancel it and your straight onto the game. Nice and easy with a hint or a back a move function and either a random draw game or a winning draw game which doesn't mean that you solve it, it depends if you get the cards out in the right order! Very happy with this, even better that it is free, well done games makers!!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Fantastic storyline. Builds on the prior books without too much repetition. Make sure you read the series in order to get the deepest understanding.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a great cd.  I turn up the volume in my car and rock on out with Adele as I drive through the countryside.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for kids, teens, and adults! This game is definitely for the lover's of the Despicable Me movies.
B00D1X0576|4.0|This app displayed a meter and showed min and max values for ping, upload and download speeds.  Basic, but good.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|In todays world I hear this STORY every time the NIGHTLY news is spoken.<br /><br />I DO NOT PLAN TO EVER AGAIN TAKE MY PRECIOUS reading TIME TO READ SUCH HEART BREAKING MONALOG.
B009WUBERW|1.0|Worst movie I have seen in a long time. Stallone still sucks as an actor and Arnold is old and wrinkley
B0083SBM7Q|4.0|It's a very well done movie with good action.  The actors played the roles very well and kept everything very interesting.
B008JEJOAG|5.0|once u size down its a great product makes a whole difference on the river rocks or rafting quality fit
B002MC9H8K|5.0|Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn narrates the bittersweet coming-of-age tale of young Francie Nolan who together with her parents and younger brother Neely, lead a hardscrabble existence in Brooklyn at the turn of the 20th century.<br /><br />Young Francie is the heart of the story,shown as a hardworking girl and ardent reader who fiercely craves learning. Francie loves her family, but especially adores her father, the happy-go-lucky Johnny Nolan who is beloved by many but earns the displeasure of his weary wife, Katie because of his inability to provide for his family. Katie takes on odd jobs, scrubbing floors in their tenement building in order to pay the bills. Thanks to Katie's frugal and thrifty ways, the family makes do, but just barely.<br /><br />The story follows the Nolan family through their hard times and makes for a compelling and heartbreaking read. Francie is my favorite character - her steely determination, great love for her father, and her never ending quest to better herself and get a good education just resonated with me. This is a compelling and bittersweet read and an enduring classic that bears up to repeated readings. The 1945 film of the same name credibly brings the story alive and is worth repeat viewings, [[ASIN:B001JPQWSE A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (Import, All Regions)]].
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So I've had Google Chromecast for a few days now. I ordered it the day it became available on Amazon. I've used it nearly every day since streaming both YouTube and Netflix, with no problems what so ever. The quality of the video is great, as good as Netflix is when using any other device.<br /><br />Setup is a bit wonky, as the instructions don't make things very clear. But the setup problems are very short lived as once that's done, watching is super easy and reliable.<br /><br />I connected mine to an hdmi port on the back of my receiver using the supplied hdmi extension. Mine wouldn't power up using hdmi power even though my reciever is 1.4 spec, but that's no problem, I don't mind using the included power adapter.<br /><br />I was actually quite pleased with how well YouTube works with the Chromecast, very quick and very responsive. It's clear that Chromecast works to make sure the video quality is as good as it can be.<br /><br />I'm quite excited to see what applications come to Chromecast in the future.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Not the product I was expecting. Couldn't get text to speech TTS to work. Not worth the $3.99 I paid for it. Would like to return it for a refund.
1250029465|5.0|Was intrigued by newspaper article about this cat and James and ordered immediately (I am a cat lover and have a tom who looks much like Bob who was rescued from a woody area near our home).  The book arrived very quickly, well wrapped and secure -nothing to complain about.  The book is heart-warming!  Those of us who love animals are dismayed at the abandoned, lonely pets who have no one to care of them.  This touched my heart!  The book is well written and inspiring.  I intend to purchase more copies for gifts for Christmas.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Fun, entertaining, silly.. Have your kids draw the pictures for you , makes for even more fun. Collect points to get more colors to draw with.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|Slow to start and developing......<br />Good rainy day movie<br />good actors but the story<br />really never came together<br />close but no bulls eye
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Easy read.  Not as juicy as the show, but still thought provoking.  It really made me think about the definition of justice.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Having gone through my own awkward phase in high school, I must say that I could identify with the main character, Charlie.  While I didn't go through every single thing he went through, I understand the need for acceptance, being the quiet observer to all the goings-on around me.  I, too, watched the cool kids bully the not-so-popular and suffered my own slings and arrows, as well.  I, too, made friends with those not considered \\"hip\\", \\"with it\\", \\"cool\\", etc.  We are also both survivors, not succumbing to the pressures to fit in when we were born to stand out or not allowing personal tragedy to break us.<br /><br />Excellent, well-acted movie.
141694737X|5.0|This book is adorable. The flaps are sturdy and small, difficult for an infant to really grab with a fistful and tear. She has to use her pincer grip to even touch the flaps (at 9 mo).
B003THHIEM|5.0|it is a fun to watch over and over. It is well written and thought out that it I keeps me watching
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I've been a fan of Tolkien since I was too young to even know it.  The Hobbit was my bedtime story book that my parents read to me, chapter by chapter, and it's stuck with me until now.  To finally see the story on the big screen is a real treat.  At first I was a little skeptical about Peter Jackson's 3-movie approach to a book that is just 19 chapters long but at least with &#34;An Unexpected Journey&#34; this has allowed him to put a greater level of detail in the movie and not gloss over details that are important to devoted fans.  I wish he had taken the same care with the Lord of the Rings trilogy but that is for another review.  All and all I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  I'm looking forward to the &#34;Desolation of Smaug&#34; later this year.
B00271SFB6|5.0|James Bond fans may or may not like Daniel Craig's Bond, but it is far closer to the Bond of Fleming's novels than any of his predecessors. All but gone are the sexy gadgets and suave tuxedo-wearing lady-killer, replaced with a gritty, rough and most of all human Bond.<br /><br />One of the best in the series.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was a bit surprised at the quality of this, I thought that perhaps the reviews were juiced since the author started out as one of the Amazon only authors and I've noticed frequently those reviews seem artificially fluffed up.<br /><br />That said Anthony Ryan is no joke.  I read the original edition, I've heard they created a new edited one to fix some of the grammatical errors in the book, and I agree in the first cut, there were a bunch of them.<br /><br />That said, the story telling is amazing, and the book takes you down a tremendous ride.  I keep looking for book #2, but it's just not out there.<br /><br />I don't want to throw any spoilers in for the story, but I'd put this one up there with George R.R. Martin, Patrick Rothfuss, and Brandon Sanderson as some of the my favorite fantasy works.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Nice slow, easy reading. If you want constant excitement, this book is not the book for you
B000VSAEYI|5.0|my son and friends love this pool, definitely I will recommend it, summer  time is the best time of the year!!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is one of my daughters favorite games. She loves dinosaurs and liked being able to take care of them.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game. It brings back great memories of playing this game with my family. I just wish you had more free games..
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is a very simple game that draws you in. Very easy to be drawn in and very hard to put down
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Pharrell Williams is one of those artists that you really don't hear much of but has great talent. Must listen!
B0018OFN1S|5.0|i Love every movie in this series. Nothing like hot guys driving fast cars! Worth watching over and over again
B00BF11STU|5.0|It was suspenseful. It was 'tight'. It never let our attention go while watching it ... and we talked about the movie afterwards.<br /><br />Overall - great (and fantastic to watch via Amazon!).
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I found the book boring in the beginning.  It got very interesting towards the end.  It can never compare to the book &#34;The Help.&#34;
B002RVCD0U|4.0|You will appreciate this movie  ... although many loose ends are left with the ending ... I see lots of opportunity for quality sequels.<br /><br />What's not to like for man:machine conflict.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I really look forward to seeing Season 2.  Every once in a while the pic was a little fuzzy, but overall great.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I appreciated the action. I appreciated the acting. It is a '007' film - but entertaining. The motivation for the current '007' was a bit artificial ... but acceptable for a movie ...
B00CDT41RY|4.0|A bit bloody and lots of violence.  Good acting and absurdly funny.  Typical Torantino fare. Well worth watching.  Not for kids.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Just realized I could get this app as recommended by Dr. Oz to help you sleep or just relax.  Slept so well with it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to set up and I love all the no-snooze options. I am definitely awake by the time I get the alarm turned off.
B000005EJL|2.0|I would have to agree with other one- and two-star reviews. This is a far cry from their earlier work. Roger Hodgson's departure is clearly felt here with this lackluster effort.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It was interesting enough to keep me reading .  There is a point in the book where everything turn to drama.  At the end there is talking that seems to take forever and just repeat the same stuff three times.  It was a good book.  After reading it I can't help but think of it as a non-space StarWars.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I purchased this as a birthday present for my sister-in-law who just turned 50. Ordered it on Sunday- received with plenty of time to spare! You should have heard the cheers from the ladies at the party! Fun gift that I have since borrowed (I'll admit-- it was the master plan all along).
B002RCEBBI|5.0|was very surprised how much this band and this album espicially are to my taste found a new favorite band looking forward to more of their work
B000EWD1KK|5.0|One of his best movies, show casing his many talents. My sister can watch this over & over again. Clean family entertainment.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Dave Grohl does it again. Best music documentary I have ever seen. It was like a total trip down a musical memory lane!
1579128149|5.0|This is a marvelous book! I have bought 3 of them for grandchildren. Two are in High School and taking Chemistry this year, and one is an eleven year old girl with a fascination with the &#34;elements!&#34; What a wonderful, practical and fun way to learn.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I love Foo Fighters (favorite band) and this double album is fabulous. Really dig the acoustic disc.....Dave is a damn genius!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really enjoying this series.  I really shows how the rich used to take of the poor.  This family is not selfish and spreads the wealth.
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|Definitely has moments where I though it was good I paid attention to the rating--little ones should probably not be watching. I watched it with my 12 year old daughter at night out in the backyard (DVD projector) for extra affect. We both were anxious during some of the scenes where two children and others are being chased or eaten (not the good guys or kids of course) by either a TRex or those nasty Raptors. Raptors are like the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz...you might remember them FOREVER. Pretty good graphics for that time period too. Good scary fun if your kids are old enough to sleep it off. There were a few &#34;bad words&#34;--nothing major.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Thought it was a sweet and intensely readable take on teenage relationships and how to deal with pain and loss.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|I'm sure if amazon reviews were around during the red scare of the 1950's this book would have gotten some scathing reviews, but it's wasn't.  It was one of the best books I've ever read.
B002BVOYBW|5.0|Johnny Depp...need I say more? Ms. Masterson did a great job...some scenes too funny to believe. Aidan Quinn  does a great job as the doting brother.
B00BUWY74M|2.0|I liked what I read, but the type on all of the charts is way too small to read on the kindle, and you can't adjust the size.  It's like nobody even checked what it looked like when they published it.  I gave it 2 stars because the part that was legible was very good.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|The tagline of \\"Finding Her Feet\\" pretty much sums it up rather well, \\"drama, tragedy, family, life.\\"  It only fails to mention how DARK this story is in places.  But I like dark!<br /><br />The death of a loved one is only the start of this rollercoaster emotional ride -- a jet-setting story that takes us around the U.K. as Amanda, the main character struggles to find her way (or her feet, to be more subtle!) in what turns out to be a very cruel world.<br /><br />It was a great read and I'm curious about the author's other work.
0199267170|5.0|Excellent editing. Great introductory sections and helpful information. The introductions to the plays are great, and the reasons given for selections and order of plays is wonderful.
B007P3TMW2|1.0|I wanted to see this movie while my day off, and first of all I had to pay an expensive amount of money for the rent that only allows you to have it one day, the picture quality was bad and it took forever to download never buying or renting a movie on amazon again
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, what a great way to spend more money on horses and shows, that's not yours! If you're a horse lover, get this game.
B0072NWKEC|4.0|I have read several books by Philip Kerr and the settings during World War II are realistic and really show how these times were difficult for the people involved. Also an exciting thread.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|For older action movie aficionados, this is a trip down memory lane....but it still depth of story and plot.  I felt there was a failure in giving the actors character and making the audience care about them.  Lots of action and entertaining, but it is hard to call it a great movie!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|easy to play amd fun for the kids so i reccamend it for any one hehehahahah cool app! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! iys an average app tho it is like temple run only a modern version?!?
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|It's always good to see someone do something so unselfishly for humanity, especially in a time with so much madness in the world
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was entertaining enough but not memorable in any way. Probably a good book for a long plane ride. For that reason I generously give it the 3rd star.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show! We are currently on to the next season. The characters are very likable and the storys are entertaining.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|We've been dodging movie violence with our kids, so some of the obvious kid movies have been off our list. This one we would not have shown to our preschooler, but now that she's in Elementary School, we let her watch, and it scared her in parts, but not too much.<br /><br />It's a standard Disney plot: parent separation, a handsome scoundrel hero, and a bunch of threatened violence.<br />There are a few scenes of actual violence, and one death. All are portrayed in a kinda cartoonish way, so except for the death, not much worse than my childhood Elmer Fudd cartoons. The dark scenes of kidnapping and threatened violence scared my youngster quite a bit, but the resolutions worked out.<br /><br />All around, a decent coming of age theme, with a rewarding happy ending.<br /><br />Oh, and the streaming was flawless.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|This is a series I can never get enough of... the fx alone are outstanding, but just the fact that transformers is on the big screen; no more chores getting in the way and no more siblings that wont let you sit in your favorite spot. .. and of course now I can watch it whenever I want in the privacy of my own home
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This product arrived on time and in good shape. The DVD played well and the movie is very entertaining. Great preparation for the upcoming &#34;RED 2.&#34;
B00957T6X6|5.0|I just had to read this book have to read the ones before LOVE it all the drama and kings and queens
B000MKD9P6|5.0|The loved the movie & was not expecting to! I adore Meryl Streep & Ann Hathaway. The two of them kills their roles and portrays her character brilliantly! The rest of the actors are cast perfectly as well. This movie is certainly meant for a girls night!
B005SAXZFO|4.0|this movie had excellent action shots tthroughout. It was clear that some thought had gone into the fight scenes themselves
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Every time an episode ended, I had to take a deep breath, and then dive right into the next one!  Common season 3!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good game,good graphics easy to learn the basics you don't even have to use real money to advance in the game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The show is simply marvelous, darling!  The actors are incredible and I feel like I'm a part of what is happening.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the game. It takes time to play but it is fun and challenging. It's easy to get friends and you don't have to give access to your own friend list.
1400067820|5.0|I chose this book on a recommendation and have recommended it to many other people.  The writer's choice of words and esoteric approach to some subjects make this a bit difficult to read.  But the content is truly outstanding.  It emphasizes the need to approach difficult issues on a total-system basis, as opposed to looking for a simple, single explanation for things.  Very few difficult issues have a single point solution.  It is not until the problems are viewed from multiple angles and by completely thinking them through, that a well-thought-out, rational solution can be achieved.  He makes many, many examples of ways to do that, that are incredubly insightful.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|This was a case that was somewhat flimsy and didn't seem to fit the Kindle as well as I would have liked.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I like playing stump the App. Shazam  always wins. It gives.information on.the artist and song. If  its part of a sound track it will give details on the T.V. show.  Great App.pp
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My son had suggested I watch this, but I had not thinking it was about zombies....Finally, watched it, and loved it!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Every season gets better.  I particularly liked Hannah as his Love/nemesis. Dexter never fails to please.  Bring on season eight!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very unusual and addictive.  I was very taken with the two main characters.  The plot kept me enthralled.  Good book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Like a good novel that you can't put down, Downton Abbey keeps you totally intrigued.  I love this series and can't wait for the next one.
0393061310|4.0|THE BOOK HAS GIVEN ME A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONS AND POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE VAST DIFFERENCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RACES AND CIVILIZATIONS IN THIS WORLD.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I bought the 1st book in the series along with this one (1.5). I felt this one ended too suddenly but it's still an awesome read, especially as it is backstory for a character from the first book. I gave it 5 stars for being awesome backstory and giving more life to the first book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Engaging production and wonderful acting by a superb cast.  The picture of a decaying social structure and way of life after the first World War is poignant and pathetic at the same time.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I came across this book by chance looking for a book for a friend. I looked it up on Amazon and bought it just from the description. I love the book and book 1.5. Can't wait to read 2!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series is one of the best series I've seen and I've been watching TV since the Lone Ranger back in the 50's. Clever writers make sure that every episode has an interesting twist. Kudos to the writers and applause to the interesting cast of characters.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|My son loves this movie more than any other that we own.  We watch this over and over and over!  Good thing it won't wear out a tape!
0395759242|5.0|I recently went to an exhibition of art of the Luba people of Congo. It was obvious that the pieces were taken stolen from Congo, as (1) the dates of their &#34;addition to collections&#34; matched Leopold's era of enslavement/murder, and were virtually anonymous as to artists.<br />(2) They were on loan from the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Belgium, which, from everything I've read, remains pretty much in denial about their genocide in Congo.<br />Adam Hochschild has done a great service in exposing this heartbreaking epoch, and the horrors brought to Congo by Leopold. Additionally disturbing, was how so many countries, including the U.S., collaborated in this African holocaust, ostensibly for &#34;humanitarian&#34; purposes. Long after this veil of deception began to be shredded, the imperialist powers, in their consummate greed, failed to end support for the blood-soaked enterprise of Belgium. Given this history, and the years following the Belgian/ U.S.A. coup that overthrew the democratically elected Lumumba, and installed the tyrant Mobutu to rule for decades, we can understand a lot better why the Congolese people still endure so much chaos today. Congo is still being set upon, and torn apart for it's wealth in resources- even the coltan we have in our cell phones.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like that I can see the percentage of my battery charge.  with the details it provides it helps me see the overall condition of my lithium battery.  I keep using it.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Don't let the rating discourage you from this film.The worst thing about it is the violence , there is no nudity and very little foul language.The violence is not umbilical anyway - remember Elijah's killing of the priest's of the false religion among other things.The acting is wonderful and the story is beautiful , the movie carries a really great message especially for the faithful.I bought this to let my 60 year old southern baptist mother watch it with me and she loved it !
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie is like a warm fire. The actors being close to my age group and can identify with some of what they are going through and there's wisdom to learn in it. One of those movies that brings tears to my eyes when I see it !
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this one down.  This is the kind of book you want to talk about with friends when you are done.  Masterful character development.
B006LSZECO|4.0|With past news stories of real life persons such as Scott Petersen (in California  whose wife turned up murdered) this novel has true relevance.<br />Its amazing number of plot turns and deep look into the main characters was terrific.<br />I was ( personally) very disappointed in the ending.<br />But while reading it, I simply could not put it down.<br />Highly recommended reading.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the show. Witty and dramatic. Nice screenplay. Definitely keeps your attention. Waiting for the next season! Saw all 3 seasons in less than a week.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I saw the first one and liked it now the second, it is an excillent follow up......plenty of action!!!  I thought it was a Great movie.
B009CG11WY|5.0|i liked this but u should not require a narrative if you r using a star system.  it will prevent me from rating in the future because of time

B00BWJARHO|5.0|The Hobbit is a feast for your eyes and the ultimate journey of your dreams. Watching this can do you no harm. I don't know what else to say about it. It's long. It's a good story. Kinda good and bad that they are dragging it out over 3 films. Check it out.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is now the biggest (and cheapest) release from Google this year. The Chromecast is an absolute steal for the price of $35, and even sweeter if you happened to be one of the people who got it when the Netflix codes were still available for 3-free months. That roughly brings your total out lay down to about $11 before taxes. Which is not bad at all considering all the things that it can do and the fact that it is truly multi-platform with any device that can use chrome.<br /><br />When I first heard about the Chromecast, I had zero interest, but the more I heard it talked about prior to release, the more interested I became. I already had a desktop computer that was connected to my TV which allowed me to use Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, etc on my main TV, instead of a cable tv connection. In addition there was also a PS3 and Xbox360 connected to this TV as well. But eventually when my girlfriend moved in, my toys needed to go upstairs into the spare bedroom. This left me without an option to watch netflix, Hulu, Youtube in the livingroom.<br /><br />If I had a \\"Smart\\" tv, then I could just connect to the internet and continue watching the same content as before, my plasma is a bit before the time of \\"smart\\" tvs, so the Chromecast is a wonderful device as a replacement. It is very low power compared to the original desktop PC that was originally powering my internet content. It does get a little warm however.<br /><br />Setup is very easy, taking only 5 minutes or less. It consisted of downloading the chromecast app, plugging in the chromecast and powering it up, connecting to the chromecast and granting it permission to join my existing wireless network.<br /><br />I currently have the chromecast plugged into the back of my home theater receiver on its own input channel. I have found myself multiple times while browsing my flipboard app coming across a video, flipping on the tv and connecting to the chromecast. It's just so much better to watch it on a bigger screen. I'm really hoping the developers take this device and run with it, giving users a way to cast stored media on their phones, tablets, laptops, etc to their tv.<br /><br />I think something like this would be a great present for my parents who may be interested in some of the content on netflix, but aren't really sure how to access it in an easy way without hooking the laptop directly to the tv.<br /><br />I purchased mine in store at best buy, apparently the day before they were supposed to be available for sale, had i known the demand would be like this, I'd have bought 2!!!
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|The graphics are nice but it does not respond fast enough for breaking and turning. I would not pay for it, but it was free.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in many years.  The writing is outstanding, and the characters were so well developed and human...I plan to read the other books by this other soon, although I want to space them out -- his novels should be cherished and savored, so I don't want to rush the experience.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|If you ever wanted to know anything about 'Scarface' the movie, then this is the book for you. Not only does it give you a collection of information, interviews, cast and crew thoughts, opinions and insights, but also Damian's own research. This book definitely made me look at this movie in a whole new light and made what was a good but violent movie for me into one filled with depth and honesty. I love this kind of work which enriches the art it stands for. Looking forward to the next movie guide by Damian.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The first and almost presumptuous goal of the book was indeed vary faint  but grew immensely as the total of all known but not quite fair departure of Ender Wiggin, that is to say that if I ever came across this book I would reed it again. In which case I give this book 5 out of 5. So buy it you will not be disappointed.
B008LH4YYC|1.0|You got to buy this app? Wtf! It's a shame. I can get it free for my phone but not my kindle. You suck!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show, but be prepared to not get attached to the characters because the show is not afraid to kill off lead characters!
B004ADH1RI|4.0|this movie was great when it first came out when I was a kid, and it is still great today
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Phenomenal show!  Measures up to &#34; The Walking Dead,&#34; ER ( the good years) and all well written and acted tv dramas! The best of the best!
B0009UC810|5.0|Great story, great acting, great music ... and comedy over the top!!  Just perfect!!<br />I would have driven 3000 miles to have seen the Blues Brothers live!!
B00BOUL9DM|1.0|Does not allow you to earn coins by skipping to the next item.<br /> When you get stuck, too bad you have to by coins or walk away.<br /><br /> .
B0063GORYU|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME.<br />Play it all the time.  Great fun for the whole family.  Very easy to play and very addictive, too.
B003V40SGS|4.0|A sci-fi oldie with both feet in the dark side.  Very good special effects for it's time with an esthetic effect something like getting dizzy on a merry-go-round.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I couldn't put this book down until the middle of the book.<br />It makes you realize the other side of life and the power to<br />change
B00C1BU8G2|5.0|Playing on a lot of young peoples' fascination with dinosaurs, this movie does a great job of bringing a &#34;what if&#34; scenario to life.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|After getting used to the syntax and sentences a paragraph long , this was a fun summer read. Always enjoy jane Austen.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This triolgy is amazing!!! It is extremely well written! I was on the edge of my chair wanting more all the twist and turns in the plot and the endings of all three books were very well thought out!! Definantly worth the money. I read all three in about 3 and a half days. Which is a feat let me tell you but this triolgy is a must read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it! Just wish season three was more than eight episodes. Such a great cast! I l Oki ve watching my own Dowton marathon.
B008MM9630|3.0|This game is great for young children learn in to take care of things for themselves. We really enjoy it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Fun movie even for adults.  I don't know if I'll be watching it over and over again but it was a fun movie to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton takes me to a place and time that did not stay with us long (some of it for the better and some that we would do well to remember) - it explores the joys and tragedies if its day and what it was to be an owner of land and a person of service to that land. The entire cast is Gold and I look forward to as many seasons as they will give us!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excellent fun game,$4.99 is a little much, but I enjoyed it. Hints were good and puzzles not too hard.<br />Very pleased
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Biggest misstatement ever: \\"I'll be right there - I'm only going to play Minion Rush for a few minutes.\\" Two hours later...
B00B1MHA18|4.0|Muscular, intense blues that only a shrewd performer like Ben Harper, accompanied by Charlie Musselwhite, could pull off in the face of the current musical climate of inauthenticity--the Black Keys not-with-standing. It's not just what it trades upon, but how vividly it evokes & amplifies electric & delta blues traditions. Harper has been prepping for this for a long time--& he takes it by storm. For me, Bloodside Out is the epitome of this album, with its choppy, brutal drive. This wasn't conceived for historical purists, it's a pirate raid on all the hallowed blues sanctuaries. Refreshing indeed.
1250006341|5.0|I first read this when I borrowed it from a friend; since I've given as gifts.  Compared to bookstores, this is a fantastic price!<br /><br />I love the historical explanations and elucidation.  The data on the behind-the-scenes is great, without being too techy for non-film people.  If you are a fan of seasons one and two, but not three (which started getting to soap-opera-ish for some people's taste), this is the book!  It reads as edu-tainment and is informed reading, but not a text book.<br /><br />It's on my wish-list!  :)
B00821OX98|5.0|I'm not a huge lover or follower of Sci-Fi, but this series us the exception. Great story and great actors! I love it :)
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This was more star studded, more cliché and the plot less interesting than the original... But if you go in with lowered expectations, it would be fun and reminiscent of 90' s action films.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I've seen it live on stage 3 times, but this production is the best that I've seen.  My favorite stage show by far.
B00B9366VO|4.0|if you have any interest in how the music you love is created you should watch this. I am always interested in the stories behind things and this did not disappoint. a friend had seen this in the theatres and praised it highly.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. We rented it to watch on a road trip. It was very entertaining. I enjoy all of Dewayne Johnson's movies. I give it 4 stars.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I came late to the Talking Heads party but this will bring one up to speed in about an hour. Silence of the Lambs is fine but this is Jonathan Demme's magnum opus (and he's our resident director at the Jacob Burns Film Center, Pleasantville, New York, but I digress...). If I ever learn to play guitar it will be to play Psycho Killer like in the opening scene.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each episode of this series was very entertaining, and I am anxiously awaiting Season 4!  The costumes/wardrobe is impeccable, and the character development is absolutely brilliant!!  A reminder of what great entertaining television used to be.
B00313PLIO|5.0|I first saw this at a rural, run-of-the-mill theatre and suffice to say it went way over the heads of the dozen or so paying patrons (only half made it through the end). The main character and I are contemporaries but I only saw on television what she had to live through. It makes one feel lucky but also warns: Be careful what you wish for.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|One of the best, if that is possible , being a big fan of course of the Stones, just another jewel!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I cn't even get into it anymore.  I had to purchase something and I still can't get into it  It was  fun while I had it
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|A great drama which accurately depicts what it's like to live with mental illness. Great acting by all actors. A must see movie!
0061537969|5.0|A must read for dog lovers. Even tough guys have loved this book. Easy weekend  beach or vacation read. Enjoy!
B005K17RU0|5.0|very up to date. Easy to read and gather information. It's very easy to access and follow. Complete information without being complex.
1400069807|5.0|I had high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome, after reading this book (and some others) I changed lifestyle; reducing salt, sugar and fat, my symptoms are gone, during the process I lost 16 kilograms weight.
B001MSMULG|4.0|The story is interesting and fast paced with a great deal of historical information. This is the first of the Silva's books I have read, will read more!
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Grand kids love the tremor movies when I rented one to watch. They wanted to watch all of the over and over, so I bought the pack of all three of them.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I found one of the experiments 'irreverent&#34; and did not do it however the basic premise of the book is something I believe in so I proceeded with a few other experiments and yes, they did pan out. Then I designed an experiment of my own and that also worked out. This is one of the better books I have been introduced to on Kindle. JW
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it's so much fun. I love when you go throughout the house and street. It's awesome!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very thought provoking. This book was reccomended to me by someone I respect. When I reccomended it to others I found that several of them had read it. A must read for anyone searching for spiritual answers. JW
B00003CXCD|5.0|My daughter loves the classics, and is only 16, this was a wonderful addition to her &#34;classic movie collection!&#34; It's perfect for her to take when we are traveling in the car too!
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|A step up from their last game with a little bit of a wacky storyline. Games and puzzles are good and I think I only got stuck on one spot. No HO and decent length.
B005HED08I|5.0|As a life long fan, I have to say that having a digital version at my fingertips 24/7,  is fabulous. It's a good copy and I enjoyed watching.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I didn't know what to expect.  The music is exciting and different.  What a bunch of talented guys!  Reminds me of Yanni music.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Bought this CD as a birthday gift for my dad. But upon listening to it, bought another for me.<br />Fantastic song selection. Fantastic back-up band. Fantastic piano playing.<br />You won't be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really great app for kids and adults a like!  Some leading issues but otherwise great product!  I'm a happy momma since my child is happy!
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|too many key strokes required as the edit pencil has to be hit each time. I do like that completed numbers disappear from the life saver list.
B001FA0WI4|4.0|Simon Montefiore knows Russian history, particularly revolutionary and post-revolutionary. Sashenka is not a beach read for sure, but it kept my interest throughout. Keep in mind that Montefiore has written non-fiction about Stalin, so he does not gloss over the terrible truths of the constant fear and betrayals of the Stalinist era.
0345803450|5.0|This is one of his best ! This is the third one of his books that I have read and I enjoyed reading them all.
B003VANOFY|5.0|They work great. Sound is clear and mic performs well. I like the auto mute by pushing the mic up. They are very comfortable and easy to have on for hours of gaming.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|One of the best shows out there. Each season gets better and better! It's going to be a real shame to see this show end, but I can't wait to see how they do it.
B000FC146C|5.0|I read this book years ago when it first came out and loved it.  I saw it recently and decided to read it again and again I loved it!  Characters are easy to relate to and come to life on the pages.
1401937519|5.0|I have read several other books about near death experiences and this was the best one I have every read.<br />It may be controversial for most people that are deep rooted in their religious believes, but if you can<br />open your mind this book will help you see that there is no reason to die to see Heaven. It's right in front<br />of your eyes everyday, and Hell is right in front of your eyes too. Most people choose to see Hell. But after<br />you read this book you can choose to see Heaven if you dare.....
B005BGBPBG|5.0|Light comedy, great cast.  Watch this movie over and over and never get tired of seeing it.  Kate Hudson is very versatile actress
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun, addictive arcade game with lots of Miniony goodness built in. Glad I gave it a shot. Can't beat the price. ;)
B00E8B1358|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. A typical action movie that is fun to watch, but not fantastic. Directing and story were done well.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This works great but when your on your 4 or 5 video in a row it starts to buffer a lot,it's frustrating so you have to let it set for a while.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series has me living in another world. I stay up and read into the wee hours of the morning and don't even mind that I've missed the sleep. I read this book as well as the first book, Bared to You, in less than 4 days. They are so intriguing and I can't wait to see what happens next.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Futuresex Lovesounds was a step in the right direction for JT but I'm much happier listening to this album! In Futuresex JT would meld two sounds into one track and it just didnt have that natural flow..but in 20/20 he figured out how to make that technique work with awesome results like &#34;Pusher Love Girl&#34; and &#34;Mirrors&#34;. There's not one song I would skip (except) Spaceship Coupe. It's got a great beat, but the chorus features the f-bomb and I'm not a big fan of the word. Even Suit & Tie loses its appeal...I feel Jay-Z's part was a letdown and the song sounds way better without it.<br /><br />I can't wait to pick up Part 2 in September!<br /><br />Favorite tracks: Pusher Love Girl, Strawberry Bubblegum, That Girl, Mirrors, Blue Ocean Floor
B007N31YH0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Usually, once I have seen a movie, I don't want to watch it again, but this is an exception. The music of Scott Joplin enhances my enjoyment of the movie.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Good movie.  I will always prefer The Wizard of Oz but this was well done.  All ages will enjoy watching it for years to come.
B007PF7MGS|4.0|Good to find a plan that allows carbs reasonably. Refreshing read. Recipes are good. Like the way ideas are presented.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this PBS series. It is very well written and the acting is phenomenal! I'm looking forward to watching Season 3.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Very intriguing so far, keeps you guessing.<br /><br />Good acting with very interesting characters.<br /><br />This is not 24, but could be a close second.
B00B6OEDS4|4.0|A nice homage to Sade, one of the best selling and original artist of the 1980s and 1990s.  Classic and timeless... Simply elegant, I look forward to hearing more from this interesting duo.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|There becomes a time when everything should end and for the &#34;Die Hard&#34; series it was &#34;Live free or die hard&#34;
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My daughter insisted I buy this so I did. This is not something I would usually watch but this one is good. Cute movie and would recommend it for family night at home.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's an awesome game a lot of fun ..the minions are so cute and it a good way to pass the time...
B0002S943O|5.0|Spectacular!  Breathtaking! Divine! There aren't enough flattering adjectives for this music concert film.  To simply call it a music DVD is doing it a severe injustice. DEVOTIONAL is a spectacular, most expertly crafted concert film I have ever viewed and heard...it should be used as a \\"boilerplate\\" for how it's done & done right!<br /><br />Andrew Corbijn is the visual imagery creative genius behind \\"DEVOTIONAL\\", as he is for Depeche Mode's music videos.  On Disc 2, there is a monologue with Mr. Corbijn that is not to be missed, explaining how he came up with the design concept for DEVOTIONAL.  While this may not sound so interesting, if you don't happen to be a film student (which I am not); this staging design is SO unique & extraordinary, it is VERY interesting to hear how this man put his vision into form, from the man himself.<br /><br />I had seen the \\"Personal Jesus\\" music video from \\"Violator\\" when it was released & clearly remembered it.  That's how avante garde Mr. Corbijn is, so I knew that between this & Depeche Mode's truly original & unique style, that any concert/music video footage wouldn't disappoint.  I did, however, do a lot of research & reading of reviews.  This was \\"hands down\\" the obvious choice:  Rave reviews from all reviewers!! Thank you reviewers!<br /><br />I've been around for Depeche Mode's career & was aware of them.  But, it took life experience for me to truly appreciate their sound.  I became completely hooked with the release of their new \\"Delta Machine\\" (2013) which 'Soothes My Soul'!<br /><br />Disc 1 is DEVOTIONAL: the concert film itself.  It is visually the highest form of art as music/music as art.  The set design, staging & lighting is Andrew Corbijn's genius.  I won't give anything away.  It needs to be seen to be appreciated.  I will say it's mesmerizing & leave it at that.<br /><br />Dave Gahan's sinuewy, slithering style of lead vocal performance is captivating, enthralling & musically orgasmic in its' intensity!  (One of the best frontmen ever!!)  Martin Gore is the mastermind writer & lyricist, who also shines on vocals, guitar, keyboards & synthesizer (how does one individual have so much talent?!), while Alan Wilder's & Andy Fletcher's contributions on keyboards, synthesizer & drums are flawless.  Watching, you are placed somewhere between Heaven & Hell, as songs expertly depict the tug of life's push & pull between pain & joy.<br /><br />Depeche Mode & only 1 other band that comes to mind, in my opinion, are the only 2 that the \\"Alternative\\" category should have been created for (or find another category just for them & put all the rest into Alternative!) & that other band is Trent Reznor's Nine Inch Nails (I'm not actually a fan; however, I appreciate music in all it's art forms &  may one day become a fan!)<br /><br />On Disc 2 of DEVOTIONAL, in addition to the Andrew Corbijn monologue, there is an MTV Rockumentary with interviews with the band members, which is very engaging.  There are also \\"projections\\", which are different models of their music videos.  These have beautiful visual imagery that are a bit more psychedelic-based.<br /><br />And, then there are the music videos themselves, which are all as imaginative as \\"Personal Jesus\\".  They are mini-movies.  Some bands do use this form of music video (i.e. Garbage, Offspring), while others shine with more \\"performance-based\\" music videos (i.e. Social Distortion).<br /><br />For any Depeche Mode fan, DEVOTIONAL is a must-have.  It should be required in schools for any creative field, especially directors, set design, staging & lighting...everything I wrote about in opening paragraphs.<br /><br />A true meeting of creative souls, Depeche Mode's members and Andrew Corbijn: what they give us is a little piece of Heaven in listening and viewing pleasure; and so much is packed into these 2 discs!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DEVOTIONAL!!!!!of the best frontmen ever!!)  Martin Gore is the mastermind writer & lyricist, who also shines on vocals, guitar, keyboards & synthesizer (how does one individual have so much talent?!), while Alan Wilder's & Andy Fletcher's contributions on keyboards, synthesizer & drums are flawless.  Watching, you are placed somewhere between Heaven & Hell, as songs expertly depict the tug of life's push & pull between pain & joy.<br /><br />Depeche Mode & only 1 other band that comes to mind, in my opinion, are the only 2 that the \\"Alternative\\" category should have been created for (or find another category just for them & put all the rest into Alternative!) & that other band is Trent Reznor's Nine Inch Nails (I'm not actually a fan; however, I appreciate music in all it's art forms &  may one day become a fan!)<br /><br />On Disc 2 of DEVOTIONAL, in addition to the Andrew Corbijn monologue, there is an MTV Rockumentary with interviews with the band members, which is very engaging.  There are also \\"projections\\", which are different models of their music videos.  These have beautiful visual imagery that are a bit more psychedelic-based.<br /><br />And, then there are the music videos themselves, which are all as imaginative as \\"Personal Jesus\\".  They are mini-movies.  Some bands do use this form of music video (i.e. Garbage, Offspring), while others shine with more \\"performance-based\\" music videos (i.e. Social Distortion).<br /><br />For any Depeche Mode fan, DEVOTIONAL is a must-have.  It should be required in schools for any creative field, especially directors, set design, staging & lighting...everything I wrote about in opening paragraphs.<br /><br />A true meeting of creative souls, Depeche Mode's members and Andrew Corbijn: what they give us is a little piece of Heaven in listening and viewing pleasure; and so much is packed into these 2 discs!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DEVOTIONAL!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;The Racketeer&#34;.  I don't think there has been even one Grisham novel that I have not enjoyed.
1455519006|5.0|1. Good story and very entertaining.<br />2. We enjoy Baldacci's stories and he develops the characters and the story lines very well.<br />3. Always looking forward to his next book.
B00BKU9ZFU|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this CD.  I purchased it because of the glowing reviews only to be disappointed.  Cecile McLorin Salvant, like Ledisi, has a wonderful voice but don't know how to choose the right material and/or song arrangements.  Sarah Vaughan was guilty of this.  Give them the right song with the right backup and arrangement and you get jaw-dropping results.  I listened to WOMAN CHILD once and couldn't bring myself to play it again until a few weeks had passed.  Most of the CD is over the top, too ambitious!  Instead of complementing the other, the arrangements and vocals are competing.  I enjoyed I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS but that's about it.  JITTERBUG WALTZ was absolutely sickening and I cringed with the following, WHAT A LITTLE MOONLIGHT CAN DO.  Wow!<br />I plan to purchase Cecile's next CD because this young lady has great potential if she can find her way......
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing. Each room had a number of puzzles to solve in order to escape. They took some thought (not to mention a piece of paper and a pencil) and were a lot of fun.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game. I am able to fall into this game for hours. I've always wanted my own zoo!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Watch it once and you'll be hooked.  This show is a fantastic family adventure that brings all your favorite fairy tale characters to life in our time.  The special effects are great and is so addictive my kids and I watched the first two seasons in under a week.  Be warned . . .
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I have always found it hard to listen to this album .But I must say I put the unpleasant memories aside and this just great to hear those songs strppied down really works.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Clever story lines, Harvey and Mike juxtaposed. Rachel and Donna so fine. And I really like Christopher Tyng's music. A Total package.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite series! I enjoy the personal journeys of the characters as well as all of the action and surprises thrown in each episode. Definitely worth watching! It's like watching the zombie movie that never ends!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Enjoying this CD, every song on it is good. You can listen to the whole thing and not skip one song!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Although the story is about a solemn topic, I found that it was presented in a lighthearted manner. I thoroughly enjoyed the story up until it ended. I felt that the ending was not what I would have wanted but it was probably the most realistic.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Great spoof featuringthe 70's & 90's action stars, lots of &#34;one liners&#34; from the actor's original movies.<br /> Good movie, lots of special effects.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love it ..awasome pic and sound hours and hours of none stop action loveing it would not have of wanted to get this any where else but hear best choice
B008CLI4N4|5.0|stays true the book and the characters draw you in. loved it!!!!! could not get enough! bonus parts complete the experience.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|my kids love this game. its good for there minds and work for things.  keeps my kids busy so I can do house work.
B002MFX0RQ|4.0|Jimmy Stewart shines as Elwood P Dowd - Harvey's most visible friend.  Great ensemble, too.  Some of the plot lines outdated, though, and don't travel well.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I like the challenge of this game and you can change the degree of difficulty. Have fun and enjoy this game.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love it I updates it and it and it is so much more fun I love it I would give it a million stars if I could so get it you would not regret it at all I loooooooooooove this game so much super penguins is super awesome
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Amazing game they still have a few kinks and bugs but for being free it provides hours of entertainment. Personally I believe they need a balancing system for when teammates leave and perhaps work on the server downtime which can take them anywhere from 1 to 5 days at the worst overall a fantastic game despite the disadvantage to players who can not afford in game purchases if you work hard enough you can beat anyone who uses runes to buy the best gear
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book. It was an easy read. Kept me guessing the whole way.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a good crime mystery.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I was hooked from the very first episode and I didn't expect to like it. This is an awesome series!
1594203334|4.0|It's the story we all want to believe... A way to raise kids to be socially conscious and polite, while independent and self actualizing...all while as parents, we can maintain our own social grace and balanced lives.  Whether or not the perspective is feasible, it is a well written and interesting book.  Additionally, there are enough specific examples provided for a reader to get a sense of what the author really means. (For example, the cry it out sessions while sleep training she describes last 5 to 10 minutes, or for her own daughter, 12 minutes.)  These personal stories are then supported by examples of research studies and interviews with medical or child care professionals.  In all, it's a great read and a nice counterbalance to the (Sears) attachment style parenting book.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The books is not only well written an  really entertaining, it also offers really good anecdotes that help in understanding why we act as we do and that it's possible for anyone to change for the better.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This book is an outstanding work of literature. The author's comments on American race relations are most insightful and resonate profound truths. At the same time, her characters both American and Nigerian speak truth to the universal emotions of the human condition. This book will linger in my thoughts for a long while. I look forward to reading more works by this author.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I am using Splash top on an Android mod HP tablet. I'm set up with my home and office desktops, and it's very cool to be able to access things that are on the machine where I am not. I can also quit carrying my laptop around on jobs, and have the full power of my desktop software wherever I go with wifi. Do get the full version -- it is absolutely worth it for the remote wifi access. I have the HD version, for aided clarity. Note that when you use this, the monitor resolution on your desktop may change, but it goes right back when you sign off.
B000050XEI|5.0|This music fills a void in my life right now and I highly recommend it to anyone who is pondering the changes life gives us.<br />Every morning (when I have time) I listen to this music and it gives me a sense of calm even while trying to get it together for work.  While relaxing, I ponder the lyrics to get the point of the song and think about my own life's highs and low's.<br />It contrasts the rock and roll that I used to listen to in my youth. It makes life seem less complicated in a way due to the leading lyrics.  Thanks Enya its great
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I struggled a bit in the beginning of this book with Marcus' very casual, conversational account of his story; however, I came to understand that he is who is is: born and raised in Texas. His account of Operation Redwing is excellent: you get a really good first hand account of the unbelievable risk special forces immerse themselves in without a second thought. His story of survival is also quite remarkable.<br /><br />If you've read books on Navy SEALs and BUDS training, just get through the first part of the book - it's worth it!
1609611543|1.0|This book is full of lies. Did not work for me at all.  I gained weight when I cut out wheat.
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|I think this is my favorite DM album in a long time. Broken and Should Be Higher are SO good. The rest of the album is growing on me too. No regrets buying this at all.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|Love Lost Girl and the Blue Ray edition makes my view pleasure even greater. Ridiculous that I had to add 6 more words.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I love Diane Lane, she was fabulous in this movie!  The movie documents a great horse, a fiesty lady and the 1970's very well!
B000I9YLUI|3.0|A little corny.I watched it for Keira. Sisters giggle through the whole movie. Lead man never smile. Not something you would watch twice.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Very fun and challenging...i love every level....i suggest it  for all ages<br />Have fun everyone but dont play all day !
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|This could have been a great movie if Costner could act and a better ending. Whitney is a born actress and carried this movie.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I didn't know much about the land down under(ignorant American) until I purchased \\"In a Sunburned Country\\"! This book is a great way to travel to Australia. I love reading all about the Aussie people Bill Bryson knows and meets all over Australia. The cafes, hotels, road and train trips are fascinating! There are also the unique wildlife, tremendous national parks, and interesting historical facts to learn about. Did you know that Australia has the world's largest earthworm! These earthworms are 12 feet long....what?....I know! And there's so many other fun facts that you just keep reading and never stop until you get your airfare and trip set-up for Australia -that's how it feels at least to me! And don't let me forget to mention that this book has many many laughs...... like \\"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy meets Australia\\"!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like the different puzzles, the hints could be better in parts.  I have enjoyed this game it has sucked me into its world
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Alien series. This was exactly as described in the ad and at a great price.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|All the great tunes are here! Love this collection and the memories they recall.I listen to it all the time.
B002M87V0A|5.0|I love the old musicals!  The stars are wonderful and make you feel like you know them.  A must see!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I really enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2 of Lark Rise to Candleford. Ivappreciated how the language dress and plot lines were all modest compared to what is on tv today.
B007RTAR64|5.0|A true Hunger Games Collectors Item!! Purchased this for my daughters 11th b-day.. She was soo happy! GO KATNISS $ Team PEETA!
034580404X|5.0|Know it's not great literature (let's not even talk about lack of quality editing, stretches in story-telling, over-writing, especially the 3rd trilogy) but still LOVED the trilogy.  James took me by my hear and ensconced me in Christian's & Ana's lives.. carbuncle and all!!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love the Alien collection. I have wanted it on bluray for awhile. I got a great deal and it came in two days. I love the packaging of the Alien anthology. It comes in a cool book like case. Bluray is the best way to watch these movies!
B007LGPSX0|5.0|My hubby makes fun, but I just cannot help but watch reruns and now that it is available here... I will try to make a fan of him :) love watching the evolution of the cast, style, and reminiscing on music that was big at the time.
B000E9910W|4.0|South City Midnight Lady is totally remarkable.  Music, lyrics, and performance.  I had not know the Doobies to be this gentle in their approach, given that there first fan base was, supposedly, bikers.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Nice adaptation.  loved the Wizzard references.  Fun and visual.  The withes were hot and entertaining!  Could have used a song or two.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show, I'm so hooked, great costumes, characters, the house!  I can't  wait for season 4 to start.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Actually, I really like the cover. It fits well; is light weight; and doesn't take up unnecessary space either on the nightstand or in my bag. Why the four stars? When my WHITE cover arrived it had a small brown stain on it.  Not enough to go through the pain of returning but...  I was under the impression you all checked your products before shipping.
B00C78K65W|5.0|I always thought this album was a \\"must own.\\"  I've owned a CD copy of it since its original release and decided to try the new vinyl of it.  The mastering is spot-on and spans across two blue LPs.<br />As far as the music, if you like Jeff Lynne and/or ELO, you will probably love it.  It's good pop/Rock all the way.  He is in fine form voice wise (naturally)and the arrangements are great.<br />I think this Jeff Lynne fellow will go far.  Far, I tell ya'!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What an amazing book. Heart wrenching but a great read. I would strongly recommend this book to my friends.  Loved it
1451673442|5.0|I start every day with a chapter of this book to start out right.<br />It's definitely meant to be kept on the bedside table.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent story line. I couldn't pull myself away from the book. Can't wait to start reading Entwined In You! Very good series to read.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Donna is one of my favorite companions, so I loved this season. It is great to have a companion that stands up to the Doctor's personality as well as she does.
B000KADH2S|5.0|I need to read it again. It's amazing. Dennis Prager mentioned it as a must read - I agree. I've sent copies to my three grown kids.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I downloaded this app for my three girls and I ended up getting addicted to it. I only wish the bling didn't cost so much :}
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I really like this game. My younger relative recommended it to me. At first, the name put me off slightly. But I decided to give it a go (positive reviews on the Internet helped, by the way), and now my daughter and I cannot have enough of it! Yesterday we spent 6 hours playing it- unheard of for me. I would normally spend 6 hours reading or walking. What I like about it: it is unobtrusive, clever, varied, with great sound effects and computer graphics. Educational. Utterly addictive. I would recommend it to anyone. I wish there were more games like this. Any recommendations?
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have used Avast! on all of my mobile devices. It doesn't slow anything down and protects your device all the time.
B007TKT2SK|3.0|Wish this were part of or included in other calculators. Useful, but doesn't need to be separate app? Haven't used it a lot, but works as advertised.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. There are great ideas and pins that make me laugh! It's a great way to see what your friends think of your ideas too.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This is typical Baldacci enjoyable good read. A page turner.<br /> Went straight to the next book in the series, Hour Game.
B001ZRYQSO|5.0|Wonderful. I've seen this program on PBS, and the songs just aren't the same in studio produced albums that I've purchased. I like the live versions better, which is unusual for me. Thoroughly enjoying it!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|It's a modern telling of my fair lady. You pick someone no one would expect and you turn them into the belle of the ball. Or in Mike and Harvey's case the intern everyone want to be. Harvey never fails to charm a client and if charm doesn't work. Enter Mike who can get Harvey information he maybe shouldn't have.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I love J.T. and he did AWESOME ON THIS ALBUM!!! I just let it play all the way through in the car. Plus you can download the whole CD  after purchase!!
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Somehow the chemistry of the actors and how they blended together just didn't do it for me.  Some of the special effects were well done (and some were not), but overall I found the movie wanting in many ways.  Still, I guess it was mildly entertaining in its own way.
B0000DK4PO|1.0|I had a very bad experience when the DVD arrived I played it and the DVD said it has the wrong region code and I think Amazon should have warned me based on the information I provided the DVD would be shipped
B00D6QU6RW|2.0|I am very disappointed. I did not hear that usual Backstreet themed style anywhere in this CD. I'm still a fan nevertheless.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it other than the adds other than that it is great and it takes a long time to load
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|I really enjoyed all the extra's on the 2nd DVD.  The Anniversary edition is well worth it.  Everyone needs to see this one.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|It was what I was expecting strange man he was but a good movie I would recommend it to friends
B00BJTGVTK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! Now I did have to put myself into the mindset of a child - which isn't a big stretch for me:).<br /><br />The stories in the book are well thought out and are thought provoking. I will definitely be getting a print copy for my smaller kiddos. I think this would be up their alley.<br /><br />My favorite story was The Little Dragonfly. The moral is wonderful and it's a great lesson that everyone can help and that everyone is important no matter how small!<br /><br />Great kids book!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I told my husband several years ago that I had seen this at a cousin's house and it was action with some good fun.  He grunted. Then someone told him about the new one and he was interested in that so I rented this in case the new one is a sequel. Since it was my 2nd time, I gave it a 4.  My husband got a charge out of it for action scenes and gags but for this review he said 4 also. His reasoning:  It did not keep you completely on the edge of your seat the whole time and it was not quite as funny as some Bruce Willis flicks he has seen.  Still, it was entertaining without a lot of swearing and WOW! No unwanted sex scenes!  We just do not care for that sort of thing so in that department I would have to give it a 5 for writing a plot not dependent on vulgar language and crass scenes.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I love using this app especially making new friends and keeping up with current ones during summer. It's easy and fun, but all my friends have the update and I'm left behind because I can't read the images or view the videos, please update soon Amazon. Thanks!
1609611543|3.0|you dont need to buy and read this book. all of the information could be distilled into a 5 page essay
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As I described in season 1 & 2 review this is outstanding entertainment for the who family and the setting is breath taking. I will watch all three seasons again before season 4 starts. Hope you enjoy as much as I did. The actors are so in character and so believable. Enjoy and hope we have many more such series to look forward to.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Glad to get all the films in one shot. Amazon had a great price. Anyone would love to get this.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Everyone I spoke to raved about this series and when it was time for season three my sister made me promise I WOULD NOT watch it until I had seen season 1 & 2. I did as she suggested and bought all three seasons at one time and watched them. I had about a week of &#34;Downton Abbey Marathon&#34;; had never done that before and so glad I did with this. The setting, period setting and wonderful landscape added so much to this series. The actors made it all come to life and seem so believable. Great family entertainment too. I will watch it again before season 4. The actors were all so believable and made the story really come to life. Hope everyone who has a chance to see this enjoys as much as I have. Lew
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think Minion Rush is a great game. I like going through all of the places and battling different people. I also like having the quests because it gives the game a purpose. This game is really cool. I definitely recommend it. Although I have a question. Who is Meena?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is good there hacks in this game and you can cheat in the game if you get this game play it
B004TI5N38|3.0|Puller was egotistical and snobbish. It would have been better if he didn't talk about himself so much.  I can't say what was also unbelievable  without giving away the plot.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love Downton Abbey- it's worth investing the time to start with season 1!! Beautiful cinematography and great characters! Can't wait for more!!
B004EBBPU0|3.0|If you know of Jim, this movie will be of interest.  The life of Mr. talented but weird Jim Morrison.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|The Pulse is light & easy to use.  If you are looking for something to provide consistency to your health, wellness routine.  This is a great tool.  I do recommend purchasing the Withings Body Analyzer Scale at the same time.  Everything syncs simply.<br />I find it interesting the Pulse \\"tracks\\" sleep & utilize this tool to determine training regimine.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|Loved playing the original video game, liked the first movie allot and own it. This sequel seems unimaginative and uninspired. It seems to be relying on the scenes and special affects of the original, with little thought to expanding the story. I was disappointed and won't be purchasing it.
1400069289|5.0|Duhigg's boook will teach you how to ditch had habits that are in the way of your success and happiness as well as teach you to help others with their habits. The book is helpful to me and I do this professionally as coach to CEOs.<br />Rich with stories to illustrate what he has learned, the book is very readable whether in digestible bits or in longer sittings. I have added it to my reading list for clients.<br /><br />Stephen H. Baum of [...]<br />Coach to CEOs
B005ES0XQY|4.0|Cushy ride Good fit. Easy on & off.Flashy color, not staid, bland black.  Would buy the product again.  Get a par is my recommendation
1885167776|5.0|This will show you why multi tasking is a crock and teach you how to better your time and close more things in a day
B005VPRETE|5.0|My seven year old received this as a gift, and really enjoys it. She had trouble putting it together by herself. I ended up building a lot of it myself, but once it was put together she played with it for several hours. She has since gotten several more sets, and plays with them a lot. The set is a little off balance which frustrates her, but she enjoys putting it back together in different ways.
B0088W7VNG|4.0|Not a bad show as far as spinoffs go, just not as good as the original. And unfortunately the show became too repetitive and lost it's original luster.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|One of the best autobiographical documentaries on a pop group I have ever seen.  Freddie Mercury was a powerhouse as a performer.  Loved to see his band mates sharing their memories of Freddie.  Truly moving.  Just a AAAAA++++
B002SHD9E2|3.0|Great story. Saw originally on broadway. The movie was good. Filled in a lot of the plot from the broadway play
B007EC27QM|5.0|I like this calculator it has %tab I would recommend this to anyone. I needed more than a regular caculotor
B008ULM7HK|5.0|This is a great CD for those who enjoy Yazoo.  Some classic tracts.  Good sound.  My wife listens to it almost everyday on her drive to work.  Highly recommend the seller.
B0007N1BBC|5.0|I love North and South, and i finally bought it. It's fabulous, and the prepackaging was fine. I am really happy.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The characters are alive and vividly depicted.  It's the kind of book that left me with pictures in my mind; everything is described in Technicolor and with great detail.  I really cared about the characters in this novel.  In addition to its being a very good narrative, well written, it offers an interesting perspective of the differences of race and the differences between slavery and indenture.<br />Some of the themes were a little simplistic, but I could overlook this flaw because the rest of the book shone.
B00DB31Y3U|5.0|It's bizarre that Amazon would charge for an app that's free on play store, and ps is up to date with less permissions. Unless you have a device that prohibits dl on play store, get that one.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|If you like courtroom dramas and mysteries, you'll like this book.  It was well written and suspenseful.  One of those books that is hard to put down.
B002CNV52A|4.0|this is one of my favorite albums by Dream Theater. They are some of the best examples of great song wrighting.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Played this on PC and have to say there isn't much lost in the translation to tablet app. Played with a Nexus 7 and had a little difficulty reading some of the cards without zooming. Difficulty seems to a little less challenging (Planeswalker difficulty on both programs) but overall still very fun!
B005YPIN7I|5.0|This was my first time with an audio book. I loved it. Not only was the material inspirational but hearing the authors own words seemed to energize the material and make it come to life. It was like having the author sitting right next to me.
1250006341|5.0|It is the perfect companion book to seasons 1 and 2.  I am looking forward to the next book for seasons 3 and 4.
B009A9EQL6|5.0|this is there latest cd you can buy just the cd or a cd and dvd set I sugest the set it has some great videos its hard to believe they put out such a great performance like this after all these years if you are a areosmith fan I sugest you pick this up It is a 5 star set I have all of areosmiths cds haven't found a bad one yet them and motley crue are my favorite bands you wont be disapoited if you buy this set
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Whether or not you're a Twilight fan (I very much am), I think you'll love this beautifully done soundtrack.  It's just a lovely compilation of sounds and lyrics.  A lot of the music was created just for the movie, and that is special.  Give it a listen, and forget about the movie that it was made for if you're not a fan.  It's wonderful, peaceful music.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The main characters of this book are fairly unbelievable. A 27 year old BILLIONAIRE? Who's also extremely good-looking? A 21 year old virgin, who nevertheless takes to sex like a duck to water? And both are way to sophiaticated and worldly for their age. Still, the sex scenes are really hot and the book itself is very well written. Overall a good read.
B009LDD590|5.0|Boardwalk Empire is becoming one of the truly Great TV shows it continues to keep you guessing and raising the bar.  Season 3 was very important after the events of the Season 2 finale fans were skeptical about how they would proceed but it didn't disappoint it exceeded expectations.  For me this is my new Sopranos the show I look forward to every Sunday it's like an event.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|An amazing book. Should be required reading for every preteen and teenager-adults too. This book teaches acceptance and the  celebration of people's differences. It's what's on the inside, not the outside, that matters.  Loved it.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I enjoy watching this version of Persuasion, but I like the 1995 movie version with Amanda Root better.<br /><br />In this version, Anne seems more melodramatic and less-independent than the Anne in Jane Austen's novel and the Anne in the Amanda Root movie version. Despite this interpretation of Anne, this version is enjoyable, and I think it's a nice length. If you love the Anne in Jane Austen's book, you might be disappointed in the portrayal of Anne that you'll find here. There's a certain amount of running and a fainting scene that wasn't in the book and that doesn't add a lot for me. :) But I like the Captain Wentworth and many of the other characters.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|If your goal is to bring one of the most successful musicals of all time to the big screen, you better put together a cast that can sing as well as act.  If you are hell bent on casting the like of Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and Russel Crowe, then add dialog and reduce the amount of singing.  This movie fails as its stars just don't have the pipes required to perform like a Broadway star.  That includes Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. The are terrific actors who just can't deliver the goods with these songs.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you ever thought &#34;all this energy stuff&#34; was just some woo-woo nonsense for the gullible, I dare you to read this book and experience the experiments, so to speak. Then you'll be in a position to KNOW whether this is indeed woo-woo or rather, WOW! So - enjoy the ride!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw this on TV, and let me tell you the Phantom is georgeous!!! I had to order it.  I thought the Gerard Butler movie was the best one, but this is fabulous. The music is mesmerizing and Christine and the Phantom are wonderful. Don't hesitate, you won't be sorry.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's compelling &drives you nuts, but has a few glitches in programme. Would be excellent if the glitches were sorted out.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|love that these come with all the pin adapters, so you don't have to worry if you have a 2, 3, or 4-pin motor. used these in an aquarium light strip, and they are very quiet.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I recently purchased a Kindle, and I came across this book. It was actually the first real book I ever read every word of. Mind you that I am 29 years old. The book is amazing and so easy to read. I love how every chapter challenges the mind and for the reader to step out and figure stuff out. Thank you, James! Being dyslexic was never easy but this book seriously has changed my issues with it and I feel unstoppable. -Joe
B004ADH1RI|4.0|I bought this for my grandchildren to watch when they come over.  We watched it together and the kids fell right into the excitement of the story.  They were telling me what they thought would happen next.  They were very compassionate toward &#34;one eyed Willie&#34;.  He was their favorite character in the movie.  These children are ages 8 &9.  I would not recommend this for ages under 5.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|visually interesting but story and characters were not that much fun.  Costumes were good and colors of them were ok.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's a great game and it is one of my favorite game ever and has great graphics I have seen for kindle
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I enjoyed the love story and the unusual characters.  It was well played and enjoyed the actors and actresses they picked.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|It is very important to remember the Holocaust.  The insight into how a person responds is very significant.  A brilliant writer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent acting, educational, suspenseful, dramatic, beautiful filming, lighting, color, love the music - can't wait for 4th season! PBS rocks!
B002C949AE|4.0|This is the second time I have read this book. I rarely will read a book 2x but this is a rare book. In my job I encounter Somali refugees and I learned so much about the nomadic life. This is one if those books that will stick with you and hopefully change you for the better.
B0091WAWTM|3.0|When first I saw this years ago, I was taken enough by its originality and sexuality that I overlooked how essentially grim and unlikely it was.  Essentially, a mainland policeman is called to an isolated Scottish island to investigate a disappearance.  The mystery carries the film for a while until it becomes apparent that the islanders have conspired to seal the policeman's fate.  I'll spoil no more, but in the light of the years, the grimness has bested the originality for me.
B0074ALZ7Q|4.0|Scene dated (if it ever existed) but beautifully written even if main character exaggerated to the point of being highly improbable.  No one could be quite SO gauche and ignorant.  Quite good plot.  A good read but left me strangely unsatisfied.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am in shock over ending in Season 3.  Matthew was the hope for future prosperity at Downton.  ALL the actors in this series fit the characters so believably well..the casting was superb.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The plot and game play are alright.  Unfortunately, progression is painfully slow.  Especially if you are not willing to pay for the &quot;bits&quot; and crystals required to keep the story moving.  Not recommended for this reason.
B0058SNJG6|3.0|I wear Crocs because they don't break down from my injured ankle that makes my foot tip to the outside.  My foot is more stable in regular Crocs than in expensive orthopedic shoes, but these were not stable enough in the heel to keep my foot straight.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book was my favorite in the series so far. I loved the dynamic between the different kings, and how the outward clash was often accompanied by a difference in cultures between the people. Now that you know the characters the book seems to flow so well. Using the syncing ability between Audible and my Kindle has made it easy for me to get my Game of Thrones fix multiple times a day!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|if you want a good, difficult puzzle game, this one is pretty good. yes you can just touch the screen until something happens. however it still requires thought
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Sorry, I had already seen this movie in Palm Springs. I enjoyed it very much and wanted to share it with friends and as yet, have not viewed the purchased one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Cheap, easy setup, easy use. Great picture quality and more App support to come.<br /><br />Check out my full review at ModoGiz.com.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|This is so boring the hair when you comb and blow dry it it is in one piece and every thing is locked DO NOT GET THIS APP
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|My granddaughter loaded this to my Kindle and she liked it very well but it is my 2y/o grandson that loves this game it keeps him amused for hours on end and the bad thing is he won't give me back my Kindle. he has hijacked my Kindle.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I enjoyed playing it.  Hated the lines for the spells.  Hated trying to align the lines, I could not make it work.
1475143389|5.0|im 25 y/o and still skinny like i was in high school...now i know what i was doing wrong...thank you for this book
B00340ESIS|5.0|This was an easy read and not presented in an academic way. There were two things that I really liked, one, how Snyder explains the core structure of the screen play in beats, and not just the turning points. Secondly, an interesting explanation of story and genre, not the way we know them at the video library, but as they really are. I recommend this book if you are serious in writing commercial films and blockbusters, and I would love to see Snyder publish a similar book for art house films.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you are a scfi fan this is a great story! The sequel Shift is also highly recommended! 5 stars plus!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Writing is juvenile and aimed at a 10 or 11 year old. Don't waste your time on this , much better books out there
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Everyone even slightly familiar with Neil Gaiman's work knows that his novels are magical on many levels, and cannot be defined by one genre. Larger than life, they can pull on strings in our hearts and souls and minds that we never expected them to. None of the previous works by Gaiman that I read, however, does it so well as \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\". The more you read, the more layers you see there. Not only a simple fantasy story, but a fairy tale for grown-ups. There's action, and mystery, and adventure, and horror - or maybe more like creepiness. It gives you chills all over your body, not only because of the terrifying Ursula Monkton or horrifying Hunger Birds, but also because of the things the author/narrator does with time and perception, and memory. And there's even more: it will make you think of all the random little things without explanation that you remember from childhood in a new way, it will make you doubt the reality you live in, it will make you look at your close ones with a suspicious eye, it will make you want to discover and dig deeper not only in the book, in the world presented, but also in your world, in your own life. Fascinating. The book is simply fascinating.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Quick read ,probably can finish in 1 or 2 sessions.just brushes over this geniuses works and ideas. Talks more about his interactions with other famous figures and how they screwed him
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I LOVE this game and find it hard to quit.  Although, the game seems to be cutting off before I'm finished with the game.  When some of them end, I still have tiles on the screen that match.
096798467X|5.0|The key is just getting started. There isn't a clear plan for a foundation but you can just use bricks on cardbord and make a perfect circle at 46 inches then fill with 50% recycled quickcrete. Then you keep putting brick down build up your walls then fill with sand. The bottom has to be solid also.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is awesome my sister and I used to play this game all night long and see who won the most games!! I taught my daughter how to play now she doesn't stop! Thanks for an awesome game.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Thought it really happened!! IS happening!!!Took me awhile to wrap my mind around the books unusual 'story telling' style but once I did...........
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Well written and crafted - nicely multi-layered. I found it made me think back to my own (unhappy) childhood and look at it from a diferent angle. This is the first book of Neil Gaiman that I have read and it is most definitely not the last!
B00CFITJKW|4.0|I like it, but it would be cool if you could see other planes flying with you. But so far it's a good game. But I wish it had cars driving in the city.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Great fun and not all 'chick flick' either!  Merle Streep is awesome.  Great fashion, beautiful shots of Paris, and a decent story as well.  I would recommend for its entertainment value!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It all worked out well- downloaded very fast and is easy to read on my kindle fire. Thank you for putting these stories on here for free!
1619610221|4.0|This book is not your typical self-help psycho-babble tome. Altucher speaks from experience about his failings and what he learned to do to break the cycle of losing. His \\"Three Legs of Daily Practice\\" lead the reader to do concrete things to improve their outlook on life. His style of writing is very easy to follow. I wish he had chosen a different title. \\"Choose Yourself\\" could give some people the idea that the book will be about becoming a self-absorbed person to the exclusion of helping others. Nothing is farther from the truth. I believe everyone can gain insight by reading this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Much better version of this app than the one I currently have on my cell phone! I use it more on my tablet than my computer now.
B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|This is really the small HTPC I've been waiting for.  It's inexpensive, runs quietly, and yet runs XBMC in a spectacular fashion.  I stream all of my local media from a Synology NAS so this simply acts as a media client using XBMC (running via OpenELEC)---which it does quite well.<br /><br />All NUCs, even this Celeron 847 unit, support hardware decoding of H.264/VC1/MPEG2 video codecs and will bitstream HD Audio.  As an example, during video playback the CPU cores never rise above 15% while streaming 1080p video with HD Audio to a Yamaha AVR.  If I have the NUC decode the HD Audio and out multi-channel LPCM it can occasionally rise to 18%.  I was worried about not getting the i3 NUC due to the faster processor (and faster GPU) but even the add-on Aeon Nox skin for XBMC runs very smoothly.  For running a HTPC under Windows more horsepower may be desirable but this thing screams under OpenELEC.<br /><br />Speaking of OpenELEC, without the overhead of Windows this unit runs XBMC just fine using a 2GB memory stick ([[ASIN:B005NU47XI Crucial 2GB Single DDR3 1333 MT/s (PC3-10600) CL9 SODIMM 204-Pin 1.35V/1.5V Notebook Memory Module CT25664BF1339]]) and a 8GB USB thumb drive ([[ASIN:B005FYNSUA SanDisk Cruzer Fit SDCZ33-008G-B35 8 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive - Black]]) for the system.<br /><br />OpenELEC is installed, and boots from, the USB thumb drive and I don't have (or need) a hard drive of any type although one could install OpenELEC (or Windows) on a mSATA SSD if desired.  I also realized that I already had an identical stick of RAM so I installed both (4GB total) but it doesn't really have any advantage since the system reports >3GB of RAM available during HD streaming (and this is with the GPU assigned MAX MEMORY in BIOS).  OpenELEC boots from the USB and resides in RAM but since the whole thing, including XBMC, is so small (<200MB) it really demonstrates how bloated many modern operating systems really are for a HTPC.<br /><br />FWIW, I already had a HP Media Center IR receiver ([[ASIN:B000Z7XJME HP Infrared Receiver for HP Media Center 5188-1667]]) and a Harmony 900 remote that both work automagically with OpenELEC.  The key to setting up the Harmony is to select a device of \\"Media Center PC\\" ==> Microsoft ==> MCE-1039.  This will map 99% of the buttons on the Harmony.  I had to manually assign the skip button but the command was already in the Harmony database so it was a snap.  Also, the Harmony will wake the unit and put it to sleep.  Just make sure the XBMC power setting for \\"shutdown\\" is set to standby.<br /><br />EDIT: I forgot to add---the NUC includes an external power supply but you must supply your own \\"mickey mouse\\" power cable for your own locality.  I used a [[ASIN:B000AV14OK Belkin 6ft / 3 Prong Notebook Power Cord]] since I could get Amazon Prime shipping with the rest of my order but there are many choices on Amazon.<br /><br />EDIT #2: I also hooked it up to a Kill-a-Watt device to check out the power consumption.<br /><br />As baseline, the NUC had 4GB of RAM (2x2GB) installed with a 8GB thumb drive and an IR receiver installed in the rear USB ports.  No mSATA drive was installed nor was a Wifi/Bluetooth module.  OpenELEC was installed on the 8GB flash drive.<br /><br />During playback of a 1080p MKV (H.264/DTS-HD) being streamed via a wired network the draw varied between 17.6W and 18.4W.  In standby (S3) it draws a flat 1.0W.  Lower power (S4/S5) standby are supported by the NUC but I am unable to use them with my remote to wake the device.
0545265355|5.0|One of my favorite trilogies. I would highly recommend it. Suspense, romance, twists, great character development, bravery... It is violent due to the context of the story, however the rest if very clean. Excellent!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Don't let the reviews mislead you, the original effects are still here. In the Blu-ray collection you have the choice to watch every episode with the original effects or the newer CGI effects. Even the newer effects still look cheesy most of the time. Better quality cheese but cheesy none the less. The enhanced surround sound sound track I found irritating. The vocals where hard to hear without turning the volume up pretty high then you got blasted by the surround channels. Your system may work better but I used the original mono sound track when watching. The extras are good and The Trouble With Tribbles disc is fantastic. It gets an entire Blu-ray disc devoted to just that one episode.
0385737955|4.0|The book is very intriguing. The first half was a little slow (but still keeps your attention!) & you're just as confused & lost as the main character. Once it picks up, things start happening! The last few chapters are absolutely crazy. It's a good seg-way into the next of the trilogy.
1451695195|1.0|A very captivating and seductive read but definitely not consistent with orthodox Christian faith.  The author's website validated the nuanced code words in his book as being counter-Christ.
1936850028|5.0|I picked up this book having no idea what it was about. I've never skied once in my life. So I was a little surprised when I couldn't put it down. Rhein is a great story teller mixing humor and details in such a way that you can really feel the cold and marvel at what the competitors go through.<br /><br />If you like skiing or just sports in general, you need to get this book.
020530902X|5.0|Short and sweet book that was recommended by my instructor.  It gives writing tips for that helped me write better college papers.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I have been in and out of OT for over a year with wrist issues, and when my OT therapist recommended this mouse I was skeptical - but it really helps!
B005NFVZTM|4.0|The younger actors in X-Men: First Class had some pretty big shoes to fill and  they did a respectable job. Wolverine had the best line in the film AGAIN. Looking forward to the next X-Men installment.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is for my son and his time on the Kindle. He has enjoyed being able to create his own park and take care of his &#34;pets&#34;
B00BETX5PS|2.0|At least Thunderball had Diana Rigg. The acting was  fine, no issues there .But the story, if you can call it a story, was terrible. This movie was all about &#34;cleaning out&#34; the &#34;old&#34; to make room for  what?  New actors? Poorly written. Even the opening credits were stinky, a mishmash of computer generated whirlygigs. I came away from the movie thinking that it was a poor compromise between warring factions within the production.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great battery app...and more! A variety of other thing's this monitors too ...even runs diagnostics! Love it! Plus you will always. know how much power you have left for any function.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Love the movie, was happy to kickback in my recliner and rent this. The sound was atrocious. The music was  louder than the dialog. I had to rewind more than once to catch what was being said. This was the first rental on my new smart TV and I was disappointed. A friend tells me that I will have to purchase external speakers for the TV to correct this problem. This has  happened a couple of times on streaming rentals.
1781162646|5.0|It was a suprising pleasure. Joyland brings you back to a time and place.<br /><br />Stephen King is a master artist.
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|It just felt like a review of all the characters, as they parade one more time into Sookie's life to tie up their loose ends. Very disappointing end.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Makes you use your mind skills. Really enjoyed playing. I would recommend to older children and adults of all ages. Some levels are more challenging but enjoyed getting kids involved to solve.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Highly recommend for teachers to read this book to their students at the beginning of the year. Make sure you read it first though, as you will be sobbing hysterically the first time you do.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is a good example of spite turned into a great professional career. I enjoyed this movie. It should encourage many young women to finish school.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I had no idea what the show was about when I decided to watch the first episode on my tablet while I waited in the doctor's office. I was immediately hooked within the first 20 minutes. The show is so different from anything else out there. The main actress is extraordinary. I ended up watching the entire first season in one week. television at its best.
B000031XCR|5.0|I was so happy to hear so many of Celine Dion's hit songs all on one CD.  Miss her appearances on TV and concert, since I can't get to Las Vegas.  What a thrilling voice.
B008LFY6NI|3.0|I have always loved making spin art as a little kid, and this app recreates it well. There are lots of colors and three types sizes you can choose from. However, I'm not sure how to do things like erasing and simply starting a new picture. There doesn't seem to be an option for those things, as well as no saving. But it is a fun app, and you can make colorful, tie-dye style designs.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Had no idea that Emmy was such a good singer and that her CD would contain so many of my favorite songs
B005F2BBLK|5.0|Awesome movie!  Loved it! The animation is wonderful and the characters are fully developed and intriguing.  Captivated my attention all the way to the end!
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|Vince has done it again, his new work has a genuine country sound. The Bakersfield sound is dead on, if you grew up listening to Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, Ferlin Husky, to name a few, or as of the 80's and 90's Dwight Yoakam or Marty Stuart then it is a solid bet that you will enjoy this album.<br />I hope this is a trend that our upcoming young artist pick up on, we need more of this sound from some of the fine voices in C&W.<br />Thanks Vince for helping to revive this music sound I grew up on.
B009ME47H2|2.0|Well reviewed sound recorder so I expected it to work well. While it was super easy and simply to use, It had a hard time picking up my voice - Despite talking loudly and my Kindle Fire HD being about a foot away from me. Sort of disappointing.
0525478817|5.0|I could not put this book down!! I loved the development of the characters and their stories. It's a definite Must read
B00DB31Y3U|2.0|The first thing you notice is the graphics of course. I get that it was made by just one guy but I'd like to see an upgrade in this department, It doesn't look very good. The controls are ok, Using the joystick makes things far easier though and I would recommend playing with it. The missions start off very easy and then get complicated as they go on, I'd have liked to see more missions because 18 really isn't enough considering you can finish most of them in one sitting.<br /><br />Overall, For a one man app it wasn't too bad but there is still massive room for improvement. And to charge for the app is a joke because it's a very amateur-made app, It should have been a free one. If I had bought this, I would have asked for my money back.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|I felt it was a light hearted way to show some of the issues retirees face.  I could relate to the movie.<br />The characters were believable and the movie showed that all seniors have similar issues.  No family members to visit, can't do all you used to do etc., but they all had something that they could contribute to the group as a whole.<br />I loved the music.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|The game looks good for starters. Does suffer from some lag and does glitch out at times, Can't begin to tell you how many times it crashed on me. Very straight forward and simple game play that is quick to pick up.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of it though is that it takes forever to get something done. Like the missions are a bit of a pain to do so what I end up doing is saving up all my coins, doing the regular chores around the area (collect money, food, and wood), and then I go through one section at a time buying all the things I can. Also you have rather limited energy (one activity takes one energy) so you constantly have to wait for it recharge if you run out, Although it gets better because the more you level up, the more energy you have.<br /><br />Either way, It's stuff like that that can scare away new players. Overall, It's not a bad game but I'd like to see some more originality from it. It was far too tedious.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't mind a little sex in a book, but this was just to weird.<br />I deleted the book half way through it.<br />If you are in to kinky sex then this is for you
B00594XOZU|4.0|By far the quickest messenger app I have used. You get responses and pictures very quickly. Only complaint is that it's sort of annoying having to press the back button 2-3 times to get back to the main contact page, Would have been nice if they just added a short-cut for a quick return, Especially if you are messaging a lot of people.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A nice way to spend some down time.  I much prefer it to that elevator game, and I look forward to more levels (not holding my breath though) .
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|pretty cool app! it's really fun. i just got it today. i love despicable me and have alot of minion stuff and this app is just as cool as them!!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Everyone in our home likes this game from our toddler to the teens even the adults. The graphics are good too
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Loved this after reading the book again after so long. Will recommend to anyone who wants to review the classic stories.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this sweet book. I especially liked the characters. This was a true tear jerker. Great book for book club discussions.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Like the mix of rap and melody. Great message in the material. Great collaborations. Really enjoy. Reminds me of Timberland.
B0026KX5PO|1.0|I could not follow the plot. Why is this guy trying to take the identity of the other? It was an unconvincing plot.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Perhaps the best show I've ever see. Closed captions are in English but they drew me into the plot where I could almost understand the German language and what was being said by each actor.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I got this book many years ago as a tip from a customer while I was driving cab in Vegas. Let me just say i am not a book reader but I promised to read the book. It was life changing. I have since bought and given away more than 20 copies for people I felt could benefit from the book. So far all but 2 people have used their new found knowledge to go on to bigger and better things.<br /><br />I know you are curious what happen to the last 2 people. 1 spend his time feeling bad for himself and will never go anywhere, and the other is just lazy as hell. I got it for him thinking it would get him motivated.<br /><br />If you want to change your life get this book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am really enjoying this game! This is the second G5 game that I've tried and if you like adventure games, I totally recommend it!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Love it , finished off the set with Christmas gift Part 2. Party down with a Harry Potter weekend...dress up
0345529057|5.0|Love these books! Once you start to read them it is hard to stop. Excellent buy for the money. Amazon had the best price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome. I play it all day long.<br />I just wanted to rate this app because it's amazing.<br />I love it I like the bungey jumper and you get a lot of coins
B00992CF6W|5.0|It has very good graphics its an awesome game I play it all the time  my sister and<br />brother love it to its amazing
B00CMQX84A|5.0|This movie was amazing! The shipping was great and got to my house on the day it said it would come. This would make a good present.
B009K0P1VE|4.0|Just finished the second season, and I can say it was worth the watch. I love how most of the characters are three dimensional, and to be honest that is what pushes the story forward. The only main character who never really developed during this season was Emma. In fact, the writers kinda put her aside. She just doesn't get as much screen time as season one. Of course, Mr. Gold's character was brilliant as usual. We got to see more of his back story, and see him in many different scenarios, which the actor did an awesome job in portraying a man from so many angles.<br /><br />Now most of the season is fantastic, and writing is strong, except for the second story arc. Basically the writers introduce two villains, one a 2D character, and the other about as one dimensional as it gets.<br /><br />Episodes 17, 18, 19 are awful. The writers take lazy shortcuts, the motives are missing, and the story feels stale. Honestly, it felt like they hired a new writer to replace the old ones. Episode 18 is the worse, and almost made me quit watching.<br /><br />Good news is, episode 21 and 22 felt like previous installments. We still have the bland bad guys, but the main characters start acting like themselves again. The season ends with a bang, and actually made me want to watch season 3.<br /><br />I dunno what happened for episodes 17, 18, and 19, but at least the show got back on track.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|This is a boring game... That's all I have to say, but I have to fill up the word quota in order to post this review.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun to play. I like the different parts you play on. Its fun when sending the banana thing to see how many they get and to see if you can beat them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game and I wish I could play it every day twenty four seven but my parents say that I am abusing my kindle. it did take a little while to load but it is so worth it!!!!!!!!!!!
B002OHB3CG|5.0|This is a beautiful album. The band blends with the string quartet perfectly, which is not always the case when rock and symphony elements try to harmonize. The vocals are stunning and the lyrics are intriguing. I've listened to this album many times since buying it and have yet to skip a single track. I even prefer some of these acoustic live versions to the originals. If you're a fan of Within Temptation or symphonic rock in general, you should definitely give this one a listen.
B00A77II0U|2.0|This game was okay but easily solved. I played the entire thing in 30 minutes. Over all, I like how gruesome the scenes were.
B000JO9Y6I|1.0|Just watched the first episode.  Too grotesque; lots of blood. Sick plot.  Frequent use of the Fxxx word for a TV series.  In the one episode I saw, frequent references and talk of sex.  I don't understand how it has gone on for so many seasons.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This app is my favorite. I don't really don't go into apps again but I really went in this like 20 times, today. And it's still morning! I think this app is going to be busy for a long, long time.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I really like the interactions between the characters. I also like the struggles the characters have with ethical issues, and how the resolve them.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|This did not fit though it was a very nice case<br />i think you should make sure your kindle is the right version.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|My review is completely biased because I am a huge 007 fan and have seen all of the movies NUMEROUS times.  Skyfall has a great twist to it and follows suit with the more dark Bond.  The action scenes are typical of Bond and just when you think enough ammo has been spent, more follows. Great ending.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|From almost the first page I was hooked.  The sad abuse of the daughter was not hard to catch on to.  Her friendship with her eccentric neighbors made me a little scared at first, but as the book progressed I cheered at the magic that ensued.  I love it when I need to suspend my belief in reality!!  Yes.  It may look like a pond, but, is it?
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|We thought this would be a fun action/adventure with a touch of fantasy.  Yeah, not so much! The action scenes are cheesy and the plot is poor, at best!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Fantastic movie the acting by the main characters were incredible. I would recommend anyone to see it.  jennifer lawrence played a great role.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I loved Wicked and thought this was going to be another interesting prequel to The Wizard of Oz.  The witches in the movie are excellent and the story line behind their goodness and wickedness keeps you interested.  The whole premise behind how/why The Wizard comes to be is pretty creative as well.  The only part I thought went on a little too long was the beginning.  In trying to mirror the original movie, my interest became lost.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|This is the one all submarine movies have to be held up to. The original German version is 6 hrs. long and worth every minute of it. I read the book many years ago and own the movie as a DVD. I watched it on Amazon Prime just to see how it was presented and how it ran via streaming. I was not disappointed. This is the first film Americans saw made by Wolfgang Peterson who went on to direct many action adventure and Sci-fi films, Warning !!! if you are claustrophobic do not see it. If you are afraid of drowning don't see it. Otherwise, you will love the film. This version is sub-titled which for me does not matter  refuse to see dubbed films.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Overall, this was a good movie.  We liked the action scenes and the story behind The Green Lantern.  The 'training' period he goes through with the aliens does make you say, &#34;Really now!&#34;  In no way does it compare to XMen, Spiderman or Fantastic Four...yeah, maybe it is more along the lines of Fantastic Four.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Malcolm is one of the greatest minda of our time. He writes in a concise, clear style. He enables readers to understand abstract doncepts.
B00E8B1358|2.0|Not good.  But I have experienced worse. The rock climbing fight scene is pretty sweet.  Not much else going on.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|This is about a family who begins raising a chimp, then doesn't, and the catastrophes that follow due to the dismissed chimp.  Overall, it's mood is depressing.  Three stars because it wraps up nicely, and the ending saves the book.  This is not a book that you'll long to read-I had to force myself to the end.<br /><br />I kept wanting to like this book because of its excellent reviews but never found the good that the reviewers were talking about.  Strange, dismal, and a lot of high vocabulary describe this book.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|It was interesting enough for meto want to keep turning the pages, but nothing great.  But certainly a unique piece of fiction.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Exciting, thrilling, gritty, keeps you on the edge of your seat and always wanting more!  Love those strike team hotties!
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Loved it since I was a kid.<br />Watched it every day in High School, my sister and I could act out each scene word for word.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who love the little Minions. It's a great game for children, though the pace does quicken up a bit after a while. This game is similar to Subway Surfers.
B003L77G8I|5.0|This 6th season was very good. I enjoyed each episode which resulted in tears, joy, and disappointment when it ended with Temperance tell Booth she was \\"preggers\\". I couldn't wait to get my hands on the 7th season. I agree with some reviews that the writers continue to keep the characters fresh, funny, and imaginative. I will keep glued to the tube of Bones.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I didn't need to read this in high school, but as an adult, I've decided to read some of the classics that have entered pop culture. I'm so glad I finally read Wuthering Heights.  It really was a lot darker and more dramatic than I expected; even the snippets of plot I already knew did not prepare me for the emotional heft of this book. If you like drama, you'll like this book.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|It's awesome it's so good I love it.it has so much detail it's funominle.in every seen it's so easy to read
B00008J2PG|5.0|We can learn a lot about the priest who truly lived the Catholic teaching of helping others.  He even gave<br />compassion to one who clearly did not deserve it. Watch this with the family, you will all enjoy it.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|A great new album.  No complaints.  Great tracks, great AIC sound without simply being an extension of some previous album.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|You'll find compassion, possibility and ruthlessness all in one movie.  To think that some good ideas - the<br />cure for our ails - can turn dangerous in some ways.  Interesting movie.
1401324649|5.0|If you want a good book to read that will make you laugh. . . this is it.  It is historical fiction . . . with a twist.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Rhythm and Blues is a album of blues the way it should be!..Great Album!..He's always great!..Buddy is true to his roots!..and Doesn't forget it!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is so hilarious and charming I absolutely loved it! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh!
0345529057|4.0|Great books at a great deal. But now that ive read them all the pages have seperated a little bit and all 4 books can no longer squeeze back into the box. NBD though.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I never read the books so I can't compare the movie to the books but this was like watching some stock 80's action movie.  The funny thing is it didn't need to be.  There was a small element of mystery and intrigue that held my attention for a while.  Then they devolved into schlock 80'sdom action and plot points.<br /><br />Was not worth the price of rental.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Not too hard and lots of fun. I recommend it. Keeps you amused for quite awhile. I got it as free app of the day so the price was right.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Solid and entertaining movie.  Eastwood is crusty and perfect as an old baseball scout.  Amy Adams is, well, Amy Adams.  And gosh darn-it, even Justin Timberlake is good in this movie.  :)<br /><br />If you like baseball (and are not totally sold on sabre-metrics) you will most likely like this movie.<br /><br />The ending might be a tad cliche but it was a great payoff!!
B005LAII44|2.0|Reason, I was not happy is that it was not Blue Ray.  I returned it.  Went to Wallmart and bought another one that was Blue Ray.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|This was a good popcorn movie.  Good story.  Not your normal comic book movie slam bang fist fight ending. And the Magneto-Professor X dynamic is one of the most interesting in all of comic book moviedom.
B005GQ5IA0|5.0|This is a very interesting book. I'm now half way through my 2nd reading. The author has done a great job in anticipating his readers. I can hardly put down the book when I was reading it. The story line is amazing. Love this book. Absolutely amazing.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|Intriguing title... but a very disappointing book. I couldn't make it even half way through. The book is as bad as the title is weird.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watched the first few episodes and couldn't wait to watch them all.  Can't wait for the next season to start!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Loving every minute, great acting and story lines a must see! Actors are so well scripted and represented. Can't believe I never got into this show sooner. Laid the groundwork for Southland and SOA!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Have never been a fan of Bruce Willis but he along with the rest of the cast did a great job and made watching this movie very enjoyable.
076790592X|5.0|Mitch Albom is my favorite writer ever! This is the most amazing book you'll ever read. I have read all of his books and love his writing style. A definite buy and addition to your library.
0738711500|3.0|The biggest issue I had was that, upon receiving my deck, I was three cards and had three duplicate cards. However, it was accepted as a return and the product was replaced quickly and correctly-the service was wonderful. The cards are beautiful and simple, which is good for a beginning reader such as myself. The book is simply written and thorough. Overall, this is a product.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|I really didnt know much about Muse until this CD.  I have turned on a few of my friends to this one.  I recommend
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I like this series and I like the characters.  The storyline is compelling and I am definitely hooked.  It was the episode about the Turkish Prince that convinced me.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, but like most games it has a down fall. The graphics are that down fall, still a good game though.
1452126607|5.0|I love much of the sarcastic humor in the  calendar, and I look forward to hanging it up for all to see in 2014.  Afterward, I will keep my favorites as posters to hang up: ). I recommend Grumpy Cat, and this calendar to anyone who likes sarcastic humor.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|One of my favorite movies. It features many of my favorite comic book heroa from my childhood. Definately the best super hero movie I've seen.
1452126577|4.0|I like some of Grumpy cat's sarcastic humor. The activities are okay, but some other stuff is rather stupid.  There is enough sarcastic humor in the book though, that overall I like the book.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars is a must own movie series, and the bluray series is amazing.  Very high quality visuals and extras that any Star Wars fan would appreciate!  Highly recommend!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I can't figure how to get the music to play at night to put me to sleep....can't figure how to turn music off in the AM when I wake up.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Good movie set will all the Alien films.  Worked flawlessly with my BluRay player and HDTV.  Good films overall, I think the first one is the best of the bunch.
B000J2BRQU|5.0|I had no clue such a sport existed; but drifting is very cool.  I am not a car person; but I enjoyed it and having been set in Tokyo was interesting to see the firm in a different culture.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|Great Movies!  Look very nice in HD and has lots of bonus material.  Classic movies that are a must own!  Highly recommend!
B0018OFN2W|5.0|More comical than the others but just as stimulating!  They eye candy didn't suffer at all.  I like how I always seem to be rooting for the &#34;bad guy&#34; who's really the &#34;good guy&#34;!
B001BANK32|5.0|I know this is an older book but it's refreshing to go back to a classic. Wanted to pick this up with the sequel coming out in Sept 2013. Great story. Still lots of surprises and great to get to know the characters better. Also quick easy read.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|The leads are not drop dead gorgeous and that allows me to identify w/ them more.  I adore them!  FABULOUS
B00CWY76CC|4.0|really fun and challenging<br />makes your brain work<br />I really enjoyed it and kept me busy the whole evening long.
B004UPANAI|5.0|Now Ii'm ready to go the theater again.  This was a great back story to understand how Wolverine came about.
B00171EO0I|5.0|I loved this movie and have watched it several times. Its just that enjoyable. Can't get enough of Gerard Butler.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|Amazon doesn't let me finish at that so I'll just say if you're an 80's or 90's child that loves music;  you'll love these A Capella arrangements!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|An interesting introduction to King and Maxwell.  The ending was a bit bizarre with the characters being very limited in their responses, but it was still exciting.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|Whoever thought this combination would work; but it does.  Good date night movie.  Enough adrenaline rush for him and enough romance for her.
1400032717|5.0|Good book from a different perspective.  Reviewed by a 15 year old who had to read for summer reading for school.
B002LANLDK|5.0|I saw #6 and had to go back and rent all the previous films.....it was well worth it. I LOVED IT!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This was the first bingo game I purchased. I love it so much I have purchased many bingo game since. I can honestly say this is the best one so far.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|WHOA!  YUMMY!  If you're a guy my guess is you'll love the explosions, fast cars, and hot women, if you're a gal, like me, you'll love the gun show and I don't mean the kind they are firing.....the biceps are everywhere and are fabulous!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicted already after twenty minutes. Free to download. Good for adults and kids who are fans of the movies<br />I can play this for hours.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Can't beat this feed app for Kindle Fire users. Clear and east to read display. Better than the calculator app on my phone.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|Big fan of the original movie and this one does not disappoint! I will be watching it over and over again!
B00003CXBK|5.0|This was a Must Have for my animation collection. Demons, Forest Spirits, Reformed Hookers, Misguided Greedy Humans, Love...what more can a girl ask for in a Miyazaki film!
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this book before and it was just as good second time around. An interesting period story for all women young and old. Love Jane Austin :-)
1616960922|4.0|I was waiting for some twist, but it never manifested itself.  Good straightforward read.  I feel this book is for younger readers.
0761536434|5.0|The book is really good on the history of video games - Price was fabulous - will never buy at Bookstore on Campus again
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|best mob movie ever!!  everyone in this film is great...pesce, bobby d. and liotta are off the hook in this movie
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is awesome! We have watched seasons 1 and 2 on amazon prime and can not wait for season 3. Great characters and story line.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|Great! Until I started buying more accessories for the camera. I had to buy I bigger bag to fit all my stuff.  I still use it when I want to take just the camera
B003XRELGQ|2.0|It was a trip down crazy town.<br />Hard to read and keep track of the story and most of the charactors are not very likable and over all it was a depressing story.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett allows his readers to understand history in a way that draws them into the characters he creates. I felt like good friends moved away after completing the last page! In addition, I can speak much more intelligently about that time period and the events that occurred that shaped the world we live in today.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|the use of Portuguese and character names that are as meaningful as &#34;person a&#34; and &#34;piggy b&#34; made it hard to follow.  I guess I'll have to re-read it but at times reading it I felt lost.<br /><br />It would have been better without those literary tricks with names and foreign languages intermixed in the text.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|Hard to navigate.Using my kindle fire it was hard to control my driver. Easier on my play station hand held.
B00CWVBTUU|5.0|Bored one night and decided to watch this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised that the movie was not just for kids and was action packed and funny!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I have always enjoyed Ken Follett's writings for his use of the English language, the richness of his observations and has storytelling style.  He gives great depth to his characters and imbeds them in historical settings and moments which can be spellbinding.<br /><br />However this second book of the trilogy is no where as satisfying, rich and compelling as the first. It reads like a potboiler, a shallow thinly layered spin through the second world war which acts as a backdrop for an implausible array of circumstances that involve the interwoven and beautifully rendered characters of the first book.<br /><br />They and their past relations become the main focus of this book with implausible syncronistic moments in which the war surrounds them, perhaps touches them, but seems to be there only to complete the trajectory of their individual and conjoined histories. However, they are splendid, brave and compassionate indiviudals who play out convincingly the war's impact upon them personally, within their families, and within the context of their world as it is being torn assunder.<br /><br />Jody Picoult's The Storyteller, Sarah's Key by Tatiana Rosnay and the Invisible Bridge by Julie Orringer come to mind as books that make the staggering effects of war all too palpable.
B000WQWPKA|4.0|This is my idea of a Good Bad Movie.  Creepy aliens, threat to the world, narrow escapes, unbelievable coincidences, wise-cracking heroes (&#34;Welcome to earth!&#34;), and a little bit of pathos, plus a plot that just doesn't stop.  One of the best movies Emmerich has ever made (compare it to the soggy &#34;2012).
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A great follow up to Fall of Giants. Couldn't put the book down as I just wanted to know what happen next.
B008RKKUZ0|5.0|Simply the best! Good fun. I love this movie ! It was just as good when I saw it in the theater ! Addams are the best! I think we need more of this in our world.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I enjoy history and this was a movie that portrayed a very defining moment in the history of the United States.  The movie was not &#34;action packed&#34;, as defined by many folks.  The action was political.  The acting was incredible and I felt like I was part of congress, listening to the debates and back-room political bribes and concessions surrounding the 13th amendment.  I really enjoyed this movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not that into zombies... but I love the apocalyptic story line. At times the drama is a little over-done but all-in-all... I can't wait for the next season.
B00003CXA6|5.0|The movie met all my expectations. Very emotional to think of the strategies used back then and a dreadful waste of life.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Time Killer by Todd M. Thiede is a fast paced crime novel that kind of reminds me of Criminal Minds, in a way.  The cruel serial killer is downright creepy and the description in the book brings it to life.  The detectives are compelling as they race to stop this guy, all the while keeping you in complete suspense.
B001N3UO68|5.0|This movie kept us glued to our seats. One of Segal's best. Watched it with friends and it's the kind of movie where you appreciate the absence of commercials.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Excellent earphones that are built like a tank, sound like a dream, and should last for years (and all parts are replaceable should anything go wrong down the road.)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is everything I want in an app. It's easy to use, covers any area you like, and has updates regularly. I highly recommend it.
B00E8B1358|3.0|good sifi movie to watch for entertainment with the family. Would recommend it to others to watch. I like the rock and bruce willis
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I love me some Hobbits. I want to see more. This is one of the best movies in the trilogy. They need to film the similarion.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I really like this movie, it kinda kept you guessing all the way up until the end, I am looking forward to the next movie.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen king fan! Loved it! Easy to read, went fast. Would definitely recommend. Absolutely loved it!:-):-):-):-) very fun adventure with a twist
B00E8B1358|3.0|Nice fighting sequences.  Plot was good also.  I saw it when I was very tired.  To be honest I fell asleep in some parts.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|An historical ffwd from Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. This novel covers the events leading up to Word War I, the characters spread amongst the countries and continents involved, the political views of each, all seemed believable throughout the novel. 852 pages... Lengthy and a bit more detailed in parts than was necessary for the story.
B000GT6JS2|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for all ages. If you watch it a second time, you can catch things you haven't seen before in the background. A buddy of mine says this goes ditto for blue-ray, especially.
159463176X|5.0|Up to the usual standard of this author, a little difficult to follow at times but this did not deter. A heartwarming compelling read.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I really enjoyed this Writer, I really got a lot from this book too. Such a down to earth writer, I could read her work all the time. I look forward to using the things she shares in this book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great game. Especially playing it on a larger screen the minion graphics look cool. More mini games should be added.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I've had my ups and downs with fall out boy and previous albums. Some great some ok, but I've always been a solid fan. Even when Patrick tried going solo I stayed on board much due to his amazing vocals and very unique style. Fall out boys save rock and roll is nothing short of spectacular. Each track written and executed far beyond any previous material. One favorite of mine in particular being the last track save rock and roll featuring Elton john. It's very infectious, every track is worth listening to over and over again. This album is goin down swingin. It's great. Even if you're not a big FOB fan give it a try. You're sure to love it or something from it.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Great great movie!!!! Definitely worth viewing, have watched it 3 times and love it still! Matthew McConaughey is awesome ans great actor!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an awesome show;couldn't wait to watch the next episode.  I am anxiously awaiting season 4 beginning in January 2014.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book made me want to read all of Rainbow Rowell's work...which I did. This is a fantastic read and an eye opener to what some kids are dealing with these days. I look forward to the continuation of Eleanor & Parks story.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Still trying to figure it out. Not sure how to use it. I am working on it. Once I know how it should be good.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|It was very confusing didn't really seem to go anywhere, it was boring. I would not pay for this again, a waste of time and money $$$.... wish I could get a refund.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Very boring<br /><br />I thought It was so boring I have seen fun games this is stupid<br /><br />Sep try minion rush it's way better I mean but then a boy would probably like this way more sick
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This was not a waste of time or money, I really enjoyed watching this by myself and with my family.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app was working perfectly for a couple hours then it started loading for hours and kept pausing I was using the normal youtube on the internet and pausing too, I came here for hope but I guess it didn't work out that way
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|It was different from most movies I really enjoyed this with my family. I found it entertaining and original as well as exciting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great simple calculator that everyone should have on their Kindles. A must have for those who are doing the basics, adding, subtracting, etc.  It's nice and big display helps avoid hitting the wrong numbers. I actually dumped my desk calculator at the office and use this instead.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|I can not believe that my kids liked this! Some of the parts were extraordinary and then some were like is this the same movie?
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Despite its repetitive dairy-format, the book is a page-turner. It's been captive and thrilling until the end when nothing much unexpected is revealed. Yet the disappointing ending shouldn't overshadow the suspense that's gradually and systematically built up throughout the book.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I live in Bullhead city Ariz. The weather channel says it is 60degrees outside. In reality it is 115 degrees.I have had the weather channel before however when I had it loaded on my new Kindle Fire HD It is all screwed up.Can you please fix it?<br />Thank you.<br /><br />Please change my email address to candy 825@suddenlink.net. I no longer have the citlink account.<br /><br />I would really appreciate a response.<br /><br />Thank you
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have used Arctic Silver 5 Polysynthetic Silver Thermal Compound as my go-to thermal bond paste since I found it available quite a few years ago. I have tried others, but this is a very trustworthy formulation to solve your heat transfer dilema's. A thin coat just a .  little more than the thickness of copy paper on the very clean surface of your cpu, followed by the careful installation of the heatsink assembly will likely solve all but the most demanding thermal situations. If you are in the habit of overclocking your system, this Arctic Silver 5 Polysynthetic Silver Thermal Compound is a good starting point, but don't forget the need for good air-flow through the case and power supply, and clean cabling layout in your pc case to encourage more efficient heat-transfer from the case.<br />Again, be cautious about using excess Arctic Silver paste; while I haven't read the specific conductivity rating of this particular heat-sink compound, too much not only doesn't cause greater thermal transfer, it can lead to possible circuit failure if it drops on bare solder points or contacts on the cpu or motherboard.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My son who is 2yrs 9 months is so big on ABC's that he loves this app. He is able to do everything in Nexus7 and he is so excited. My Visual Land Tablet is low on memory and cpu, but this app still works; though the touch sensitivity is still an issue.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|The number of one stars on this film just showed me how many unintelligent people watched it. Frankly, you don't even need to be super smart (I'm not!) to enjoy this movie. You need to just pay attention and have fun figuring who's who from different times and be receptive to the message / plot of this great movie. This is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Great set of actors, great story, great visuals, great music - what a ride! Pop this baby in your cart.
B00AW57L96|4.0|This book was difficult to put down.The author knows how to bring her characters to life and combine them into a gripping plot
B00957T6X6|3.0|Which isn't too surprising because Martin's background is in screenplays.<br /><br />People really compare Martin to Tolkien? Not even close. It's like comparing someone who graduated with a BS in Journalism from Northwestern to a professor of English Literature at Oxford.<br /><br />The books are decent for sure but you can see them transition from a labor of love to a labor of labor, much like churning out a screen play. That being said, I'll buy the 6th book the minute it hits the E readers for sure, I'm hooked.<br /><br />And yes, I read them after watching the HBO series. Really, who didn't see Red Wedding coming a mile away? If your favorite character doesn't have his/her own chapter title, it's only a matter of time, even then.....
B00908DDZM|5.0|I have found my favorite new artist. His music is so inspiring and refreshing. This cd made me buy his previous cd.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This and these kind of cartoons from back in the day when cartoons were REALLY COOL and I wish they still made them today.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Walter Isaacson tells a compelling story without too much in the way of technical terms.  I found the book extremely interesting and very easy to read.
B0062EKXKK|3.0|I would have liked to give this product a 5 star review, but unfortunately a massive mistake on Sony's part prevents me from this. To put it simply: On the back of the case it says that this is a collection of the first five albums with Steve Perry. This is not true. It is a collection of their 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th albums, excluding the first three not featuring Steve Perry. They have forgotten 1980's \\"Departure\\". A shame, because it is a significantly better album than \\"Raised on Radio\\", which, if Sony had remembered the correct chronological order of Journey's albums, wouldn't be included in this album collection. That said, this is a collection of five great albums, and since my car does not have a cable to connect music playing devices such as my iPhone, it is very nice to be able to hear great music in spite of this.

B001NB545Q|5.0|What more can be said about &#34;Who's Next&#34; that has not already been said on countless occasions? It is, to put it simply, one of the great rock and roll albums -- driven, audacious and frequently compelling.
B005HEDI3K|3.0|The episodes ideas are good,but some acting its goofy .But it was the 70's .That's why i'm more a fan of Next Generation,when Star Trek started to got more serious and the effects better.
B00BE909NO|5.0|Some of the content is a bit gruesome but I found this a very moving tale- I almost expected to hear it was based on a true story.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I simply and totally enjoyed this book very very much and very anxious to hear when the movie comes out so I can see it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I've read all Tom Clancy's novels and found those written early in his career to be the best. Lately the books have be quite formulaic. Threat vector is a pleasant near return to the earlier offerings with a tight plot, reasonable hypothesis and well developed characters. This was a thoroughly engaging novel.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Every American should read this book.  Sometimes hard to read but it is important for us to know what is truly happening with our nation.
B00158K1DM|5.0|These are two completely different movies. After already seeing the 2001 version, I found it incredibly difficult to follow the original.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|I am still trying to get the hang of the game. But It's okay makes you think. It's a entertaining game.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great anthology. The best story of scientific-fiction and horror ever made. The sights, sounds, interpretations and bonus material make this box unmissable.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is an awesome movie!!! It was great to see some reverse justice done for once. Should have been more Django's back then!!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put it down. Every page made me want to keep reading. Sad to see this story end but at least it ended the way I wanted it too!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this type of game too.  Like I said whatever keeps the mind working is what I will play.  I like trying to match the tiles & winning the game.  So far, no lock up or freezing problems with this one yet.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|this game had all the right intensions....but lacked the interest to keep players playing.<br />very dull. glad it was free
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Love the way the world around you changes, to give you different obstacles.<br />It's a must get. If only it will let me submit.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Highly anticipated album that truly delivers! I don't play it often but when I do I can't help singing along.  True gem for every Cinderella fan.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|Okay everyone asking me about this game. Let's just say I PLAY IT EVERYDAY!!!!! So fun and defiantly for creative people. I like making a zombie stampede and killing princesses.
B000002UCN|3.0|Dear Amazon,<br /><br />Sorry, but we were quite disappointed at the reproduction of this CD.  The Best of George Harrison.<br /><br />Yours Respectfully<br />Peter Palliaer
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was a great story and very funny. I got a good deal on it through Amazon and it was a perfect addition to my growing Blu-ray collection. If you are looking for a good funny movie with a good story, AND you like Emma Stone, then this is definitely a movie for you!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Get this app. The application works perfectly. I installed it on an unlocked Pantech Burst with 4G LTE. Quick installation no bloatware. Has all the functionality that you expect with android.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Good movie.  It was not what I expected and it has a surprise at the end that you won't believe.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Great read, easy to digest. Fantastic combination of touching personal stories and examples combined with rigorous facts. As a career woman of Sandberg's generation, there was very little in this book I hadn't experienced first-hand. It was great to get the stats to back up what I have felt throughout my career. I strongly recommend that men in leadership roles, or who strive for leadership roles, familiarize themselves with this. One of the points Sandburg makes towards the end, but doesn't emphasize enough is that when there is more equality, everyone is happier. Men, women's, minorities, non-minorities, everyone. It is an illusion to think that equality for women benefits only women. It benefits men, children, business, and society as a whole. The more we understand the facts,the more we can address the issues. Sandberg also does a superb job of pointing out simple and effective changes we can make now.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|truly just amazing. Simon Pegg and Nicholas Frost are an amazing duo that can do not wrong when it comes to film.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's a great app when it works. It crashes all the time though, and sometimes it doesn't even work at all. I have two Facebook app because I prefer this app over anything else that's out there but I wish they fix it so it didn't crash so often.<br /><br />This app is fast, easy to use, and does everything that it should.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I did not think I would like the original series as I am not a fan of the genre.  However, the first season blew me away with superb writing, acting and directing.  When I try to explain the allure of the show to the unconverted, it can be difficult to convince others of the nuances of the show, above the immediate horror story image.<br /><br />Asylum, in my opinion, was even better than Murder House. The parts fulfilled by outstanding actors Jessica Lange and Sarah Paulson were much meatier and well developed than in the first year.  Even though the story is set in the 1960's, the storylines are very relevant to issues of today-which ultimately makes this much more than a horror show.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I see this as a story written from the perspective of an 7 year old not quite sure or comfortable about himself, wrapped in the perspective of an adult thinking about life.<br /><br />This is a fairy tale, through and through.  It is beautiful, haunting, and it does not spoon feed the reader all the answers.  This is so very much not a stereotypical Disney fairy tale nor is it some mindless, cookie-cutter book with obvious plot and the default 'everything is ok' ending.  You know, where reader is told exactly what to experience, in bright, shiny, and obvious words that assume the reader has the intelligence of a gnat.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman weaves this short tale (novel) with the pen of a master.  The simple writing, seeming effortless, and yet just a couple paragraphs would leave me with a haunting and vivid imagery that evoked deep emotion.  Only a seasoned author can do this.<br /><br />I loved the way the story would flip from seemingly innocuous, selfish kid behavior into a nightmare scenario in the span of a page or two.  And then, in a few pages, things are relatively stable and back to just kid stuff.  Just like fairy tales, these rapid surges and resolutions in the story are done via characters that seem to have pure, immense power.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the nebulous ending of the book, and the questions the main character asked, and the responses that were received.<br /><br />This book does not give the reader crisp, clear answers.  Does not explain everything.  This book has darkness and light, sadness and joy, mystery and perhaps some wisdom.<br /><br />And still I think about the story.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Gaiman
0307591549|5.0|Great book. Shows you how to be happy at home and at work. Interesting stories and studies. Sent a copy to both my kids. Has helped my son who is a Naval officer.
1781162646|4.0|I really enjoyed this latest book from Stephen King.  The mystery and the ghost story were interesting, but took a backseat to the nostalgic story of life behind the scenes at an amusement park in the 70s.  This is not a King book that will leave you sleeping with the lights on, and it is lighter fare (literally and figuratively) than prior books like The Dome and 11/22/63.  For me it was a quick read with interesting characters and a light mystery in a fascinating setting.
B005HGKW00|4.0|An interesting story about the conspirators who assisted John Wilkes Booth in his assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  The mostly fictional account points out government corruption that was prevalent in the period following the civil war.  Great fodder for amateur conspiracy theorists.
0062060554|3.0|For me, this book was ok.  I ended up skimming through a lot of it, because the journal entries were just too repetitive.  The book improved by the ending, but overall, I would not recommend it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series is every bit as good as The Good Wife, but if you are looking for something more comedic, I would start here.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The special effects are way better than Tom Cruise's acting - the effects are exciting and impressive - his acting, and it's mostly him you see throughout - is as wooden as can be. It's the same face, the same reaction, over and over and over. A disappointment.
B008476HBM|4.0|After seeing this book at the top of several book lists, I decided to read it since there was a free copy.  Although I wasn't sure that I would like it at first, I found myself trying read as much as possible. I think the author did a great job with each of the characters, and there were a couple of surprising twists.  I would highly recommend this popular classic, but be sure you have a dictionary or internet access available when reading it.
B00E1LR2B4|5.0|So you never thought about those backup singers that make so many songs memorable?  You will after you see this movie.  The Stones, Beatles, David Bowie, Springstein, Elton, Bette Midler, Lynard Skynard, and other greats all used backup singers on their most famous songs, and as we learn here, they are blazing talents equal to Aretha who had to live in the shadows of the stars they sang behind.<br /><br />When you hear these ladies unleash their unbelievable voices, you will wonder how they never made it to stardom.  Their voices are beyond belief.  So how is it possible that one was reduced to cleaning people's houses to survive?<br /><br />This movie explores all the reasons these incredible ladies who sing never made it all the way to the stardom they deserved.  They even were the actual voices of The Crystals in the 1960's, and watched as The Crystals were celebrated stars, while lip syncing and taking credit for their own voices.<br /><br />You won't have a dull moment watching this.  And you will remember it for a long time.  The music, the singing, are rare treats.  This is in theaters now where I live, but it is such a great documentary, so well done, so entertaining, with such an amazing display of talent and such unbelievable voices, that I want to watch it several more times, something I never do.<br /><br />The soundtrack and performances are rare footage that I've not seen anyplace.  It's worth seeing just for the that.  The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, The Stones, Bowie, Springstein, Cream, Lynard Skynard, Tina Turner and the Ikettes (Ike Turner is described as thinking of himself as a pimp), Luther Vandross, and other such greats, are shown in early performances, with their backup singers.  No one should miss seeing the young Tina Turner with the Ikettes, shaking their tail feathers circa 1969.  The old people sitting behind me were gasping for air.<br /><br />The audience of elderly retirees where I live, who most likely don't listen to the Stones or other groups shown, were amazed, and were breathlessly raving about this as they shuffled out of the theater.  It's almost unheard of to be this thoroughly entertained by a movie.<br /><br />Rotten Tomatoes rating for this is 99%.<br /><br />This should win an of award for its story, and musical entertainment value, as well as being one of the absolute best documentaries ever made.  And I have no doubt it will do just that.  Don't miss seeing this one.r groups shown, were amazed, and were breathlessly raving about this as they shuffled out of the theater.

B002OFWG7E|4.0|The Foo Fighters are a band that have had to kind of grow on me over time.  I bought the debut album way back in the day, but ended up selling back to a used CD store.  Over the years I have come to appreciate the straight forward heavy rock that they do, and also hail them for one of the few bands out there really keeping rock alive with mainstream media.  This is a cool collection of songs from the band's first 6 albums.  The tracks are not presented chronologically but it works well in this format.  Having never owned any other Foo albums other than the first one, I can't really comment on what is left off of this one, but the tracks that are here are all good to great.  There are also 3 previously unreleased songs that fit in nicely with the rest.  Bottom line, if you are looking to get the most popular songs from this period of the band's history this album will fit the bill.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game if you love combat!!!Really good game flows real good on this kindle fire very great game I like it
B0031R5K68|5.0|Loved this book.  Another gripping story to keep you on your toes with the twists and turns involved.  Anyone who loves Dan Brown will really enjoy this tale.
B00C32R64G|5.0|This amazing band from Denmark is my ultimate favorite group right now.  I only found out about them a couple of years ago and have all their music from the start of the band.  Each new release keeps sounding better and better.  The only reason they haven't skyrocketed in the States is radio play.  They are just now getting some fairly decent play, although it is only like 2 or 3 of their songs, of the wide range of amazing songs they play.  They are playing venues like the House of Blues and The Joint in Vegas, while playing to 100,000+ crowds overseas, all while doing most of their lyrics in English. Amazing rock band that is ranked with the screaming metal shredder bands, and they are not.  The lead singer used to be in one, but has stepped it up to this incredibly addicting hard rock that doesn't make you want to slash your wrists like the screamers about to blow a lung out from their shrills.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I have saved this story in my Tivo but accidentally deleted it.  So I am glad to get the DVD--no more risk of deletion.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Hard to keep it down once you start. Actually all the three books are good and written in such a way that if you like the first, you will be compelled to buy the other two. Very cleverly divided script.
0800141660|5.0|I have always like this particular Jane Austin film especially becase of the ocean scenes and the role of the youngest daughter.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Very interesting. Found myself reading faster and faster. Finished the book in one sitting; cover to cover.  I found the book to be very thought provoking .
B001BRAUYM|2.0|He portrays Riddick, the rough & tough convict being transported along with a number of other passengers on a spaceship that encounters malfunctions forcing it to crash land on an unknown planet that we learn is hostile in many ways.  Riddick is anti-establishment, anti-law-enforcement, anti-social, basically anti-anything that's not him.  A hero he's not, but a hero he becomes in a surprise ending that I found disappointing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun. Good way to pass time. Very addicting. Nice that it's free. My kids love to play it too.
