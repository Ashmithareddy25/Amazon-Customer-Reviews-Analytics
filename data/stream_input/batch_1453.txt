B007EC6FIS|5.0|I couldn't be more stunned by the three reviews before mine. \\"Strangeland\\" is an exceptionally strong return to solid ground for Keane, whose first two albums set the bar. I do agree that the third album, \\"Perfect Symmetry,\\" as well as the fourth, \\"Night Train,\\" were disappointments with only a few standout tracks each. That's partly why I love \\"Strangeland\\" so much -- it's a return to the sublime Keane sound of old, yet burnished with maturity and confidence.  Even if this were the first Keane album I'd ever heard, I'd be feeling just as good about it. High points, in my opinion, are \\"You Are Young,\\" \\"In Your Own Time\\" and \\"Strangeland,\\" but it's hard for me to single those out when nearly all 16 tracks are so good. There is NOTHING I want to skip here, and that's rare for me. \\"On the Road\\" and \\"Day Will Come\\" round out the top 5. As I listen to the album more, I suspect that \\"Black Rain,\\" \\"The Starting Line\\" and others will grow on me. The astonishly good b-side, \\"Myth,\\" is not included on the album, but I was able to get that elsewhere and thus complete the package.  Weakest tracks -- and these are still fine, just not memorable -- are \\"Neon River,\\" \\"Boys,\\" and \\"Sea Fog\\" -- I don't know why some listeners like \\"Sea Fog\\" so much, it's got a pretty sound but it's so boring compared to the rest of the tracks. If there's one complaint I'd make, it's that the songs are short; almost all of them are under 4 minutes. That's a shame, because with tunes this good, you really want to get into them and make them last. Fortunately, Keane gives us 16 songs here, so the album's total length is a very fine one hour. Bottom line: I'm really impressed by \\"Strangeland\\" and it will be stuck in my player for quite a while going forward.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I've been hoodwinked!!  The brilliant marketing of this book drew me in enough to buy the 1st and 2nd parts of this trilogy. Common sense won't let me buy the third. The writing is atrocious, the character development of Ana is anemic at best, and there are so many incongruent aspects of Christian's character.  What a waste of time!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I went to the movie as a middle aged woman.  As I was leaving, I heard the ages old plaint of a teenager: 'They left so much out of the movie!'<br />Indeed they did.  A worthy read for anyone who reads post-apocalyptic fiction, regardless of your age.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is not only a great read for Stephen King fans, but for just about everyone.  A beautifully written historical perspective that will definitely give the reader food for thought.
0345803485|3.0|I loved the preview of this book and the intro that Amazon allows you to read. I also have a friends and family who have read the book and gave it great reviews. The book was just not at all what I expected it to be, so I was a little disappointed. It was a decent read; it just wasn't what I expected. I will go into reading books 2 and 3 with the mind set that these are really just a romantic novel and not a bdsm novel at all. I was expecting something more along the lines of Anne Rice's Beauty series, and they aren't similar at all. I enjoyed the book though; it just wasn't what I was expecting.
B007PKOKTK|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  My son wanted to watch this one, but I hadn't heard anything about it.  It was a fun movie to watch with my son, we both enjoyed it very much.  It was well done and had a good story and plenty of laughs.  My son got a good laugh out of the pink berets.
B007EC6FIS|3.0|After delving into more upbeat Synth Pop on \\"Perfect Symetry\\", and fusing Hip Hop and J Pop on the \\"Night Train\\" EP, UK group Keane beat a hasty retreat into the safe piano Pop sounds of their first pair of albums which sold millions, especially after the scathing reviews the latter more recent pair received from fans.<br /><br />Results are mixed, from the Coldplay/U2 feel of opening \\"You Are Young\\",  the ballad \\"Watch How You Go\\", the upbeat \\"Sovereign Light Cafe\\", the bouncy \\"On The Road\\" to \\"In Your Time\\", much of the album is mildly pleasant, hardly as melodic as \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\", \\"Bedshaped\\" or \\"Try Again\\".<br /><br />Where things wake up and standout are on the ballad \\"Disconnected\\" (with vocalist Tom Chaplin singing in a lower register during the verses), \\"The Starting Line\\", the brooding hymnal \\"Black Rain\\", the spare piano ballad \\"Sea Fog\\", and the lovely title track (on the deluxe edition). These leave one wishing the band took more risks. More like these and we would have a real winner!
B007Q476KU|2.0|I heard many good things about War Horse, it was a Spielberg movie, it deserved film of the year, etc. But I also heard some other opinions, that it wasn't a classic grand Spielberg movie of old. So my expectations were mixed when my family and I set down to watch War Horse.<br /><br />At the half-way point of the movie, we were all feeling a bit let down. The movie was very slow and lacked any depth and excitement it wasn't anything new and unfortunately the story and pace never really picked up for the last half of the movie. In the end, the whole family was left with, so that's it? That was War Horse? There was nothing grand about this movie. The story was one that we have seen before, but they plugged a horse into the role. I was hoping for a lot more out of this film, but it didn't deliver.<br /><br />I won't say it was a horrible movie, but there wasn't anything that pushed it to the great or even very good categories. 4-5 star movie this is definatly not.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app on at least four devices.  As a working mother of two, I don't know what I did before Evernote!
B007MJSQSK|5.0|Finally, a grand movie with a great plot that brought back the excitement of watching Indiana Jones for the first time.  I sat with 9 year old son to watch this movie and we were blown away.  A great story with depth, action and humor.  It's not suppose to be realistic, the hero is suppose to be a hero, to get out of danger with creativity and luck.  We enjoyed this so much, we watched it the first time Saturday night and followed up with watching again on Sunday and it was just as fun the second time.  We can't want for a sequal!!
B006ZJJ70O|4.0|This is a review of the currently in print european discount edition of Leopold Stokowski: The Stereo Collection 1954-1975, the copy I received today was manufactured in the EU and this is about that copy.<br /><br />I'll leave it to the others to describe what's in the box, or was in the original RCA collection this is about the Sony set.<br /><br />A standard Sony \\"Red Seal\\" reissue from the RCA catalog that appears to be the 1997 remastering, though the \\"four channel dolby\\" mixes from the original RCA collection are not included, this edition only contains the stereo mixes.<br /><br />There is no booklet, just a fold open box with 14 CDs, 128 tracks with 890 minutes of music, in cardboard sleeves. The sleeves contain the recording information with the orchestra info on the front and recording dates on the back in microprint near the copyright info.<br /><br />The recordings are all 5 star, but the lack of any notes or booklet make it a 4 star collection.<br /><br />There is nothing in this set that is worth more than the cost of a download version, or this discount import CD set.<br /><br />If you want collectable go for the 1997 RCA box set in the used market, if you just want the music then this is a nice reissue for the budget minded.<br /><br />These Sony discount box set reissues seem more about getting downloadable versions of the original single CD releases available to keep it in print and under the Sony copyright, so the CDs are purposely scant on extras to make the download version just as attractive.<br /><br />There should be a downloadable version of this collection available to dampen the speculation on the CD versions.
B0065IZEE8|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic film. It's beautiful and simple as it follows four friends as they say goodbye. It isn't very often I find a movie that is both heart-warming and heart-breaking simultaneously, but this one is. It's truely believable throughout both playfullness and tears. Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book series that I have ever read! I could not put these books down and had all three read within 2 weeks! I recommend these to any lady looking for an amazing book series to read!
0307951529|5.0|This book details practical approaches to reinventing your income stream by examining the successful efforts of other entrepreneurs. This book is both inspirational and practical for the micro-business makers out there, and really focuses on creating a business that works for you. The examples that Chris sites are varied and interesting, and cover a variety of different business focuses - the perfect book for those of us who need a good framework and a little 'push' to really pursue the dream of self-employment.<br /><br />Chris's conversational writing style makes this an enjoyable read, in addition to being very informative.
B003Y5H5AQ|4.0|The movie was great, my three year old granddaughter enjoy it bvery much and I was very happy with it
0881036366|3.0|Yes.  This is absolutely the Dune book I ordered.<br /><br />I understood from the description that it was a heavier bound book made especially for library multi-user purposes.  What as NOT made clear is that the book is not a standard sized volume.  It's very small and with the size of the book, it's hard to handle and not easily read because it's so small.<br /><br />The book description would have been extremely helpful in stating an overal dimension of size.

B00723NWJE|5.0|New ideas, very refreshing... Great music, and the voice is just lovely. Every single song fits perfectly in the album. Thanks Norah for this step forward!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I totally enjoyed this movie and will be watching it again. It was a horse story, and the love of a boy got him through the first year or two before he went off to war. It was an interesting concept from sort of, the horse's POV. What he went through with his companion or friend. The loss and scariness of the war was very well done. And so real in the way that horses were treated during the war, they were just to use and if they died so what, and the loss of so many horses and mules during WW1 was something else.<br />If you don't care for war stories you probably will be horrified over what these noble creatures had to endure, we usually don't see much of the horses in war movies, they are there, die and are gone. This shows what they went thru, and to survive was something else. It had a good ending that I was a little surprised to see.. I had an idea, but what happened, I was thrilled we got a bit more.<br />It was a good movie, heart stopping many times, but true to WW1 and the silent warriors who gave their lives for freedom.<br />MAJ
B002JI94J4|5.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan, and I'm glad I was able to find this at a reasonable price here - the special features are great and the picture quality is amazing - pick it up if you haven't gotten it on Blu-ray yet!
0307951529|5.0|This book is loaded with fantastic, practical information and advice, as well as inspiring story after story of successful entrepreneurs who took their ideas and a little bit of startup money and created a new future for themselves. Chris Guillebeau has done an incredible amount of research to put this book together, and more than that, he's culled through thousands of stories and gleaned the-best-of-the-best ideas to share with all of us in a fun and quick/easy-to-read handbook to hustling, with great illustrations by Mike Rohde to boot. I highly recommend it!

0439023513|1.0|The 3rd book was such a major disappointment.....you truly could stop after the 2nd book and be in a much better place. The 3rd book was like the author just completely ran out of ideas and creativeness on how to end it all. Gale suddenly became a complete non-factor, except in battle.......Peeta was a complete afterthought from the middle of the book until the end......all of Katniss' friends were completely expendable as so much literary trash that the author had no clue as to what to do with them.....and the whole meaning, creative work, and theme of the entire series was completely destroyed with nary a hiccup in the final book.<br /><br />I can see now why this was not one book, as it should have been, and broken into three. As a whole book, this thing would have been lacking in so many aspects as to make most serious readers of good sci-fi and/or fantasy(teen aged or older) just vomit in it's complete and utter lack of the ability to finish a theme that was started, and then, utterly abandoned two thirds of the way through.<br /><br />At the end, I cared about no one......had no sympathies for any of the characters, as the ones that had become important in the first two books, fell by the wayside like being too much of a literary challenge to complete.....including the main, wishy washy heroine.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I imagine that the author, no matter how undeserving, will see 3 very successful box office smash hits, as most people don't read a whole heck of a lot of books, and the movies, rightfully so, will hopefully change the books so that the movies actually bring out some lasting sentiment for the main characters.<br /><br />My advice.......stop reading after the 2nd book, as your imagination will easily conjuer up a better and more convincing ending than book 3. Mockingjay is a complete, and utter waste of time.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Daughter loves this DVD..she is a teen.  It's a great carry-over from the game.  It brings the characters & story to life.
B000QUCNXG|3.0|First of all, it was a very short read. I thought the narrative was told nicely, but I wasn't completely able to understand the real motive or message being conveyed in the story line. Especially, the abrupt ending was a bit sketchy and left me hanging.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|not the best game. quite boring and not enough free play. would be fun for kids possibly however as an adult didn't care for it.
1451683405|1.0|A major disappointment. Free Will is the worst book I have read this year. It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation. There he made strong arguments against religious belief, (correctly) pointing out that religious people have no evidence for their claims. In Free Will, he makes the same error. On page 4, after describing a brutal murder, he says he would do the same if I had their genes, upbringing, etc. No evidence is provided for this claim. Saying free will is an illusion doesn't make it so. This book was over for me by page 5.<br /><br />I will not respond to any criticism of my review by any of this book's supporters. After all, anyone who agrees with the book's premise must, if they're intellectually consistent, concede that they would write the exact same review if they had my genes and life experiences.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I use these for producing and mastering songs and these have got to be the best studio monitor headsets out there.

0307951529|5.0|This is a book I will keep close. The stories about entrepreneurs broken down into an almost 'how to' format makes a great resource for inspiration, as well as, serious business insight. As an entrepreneur, I related to almost everything in the book. It's real. It's happened... I felt like I was surrounded by many people just like me at a cocktail party, sharing stories and tips.<br />  The stories, coupled with the practical business information makes this an easy read. You come away with almost a crash course in what you will encounter when becoming an entrepreneur!<br />  I'll refer to this book every time I need inspiration, advice, or hard core info for anything I may do in the future. I thank the author for writing this... It really makes sense to me!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This true story of a North Korean young man was sad and riveting.  The book brought the reality of life in No.Korean labor camps front and center and made me feel so sad for those people trapped in that horrible regime.  It also makes me appreciate being born in America and that I am free to enjoy and prosper in the life that America affords us all!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm always looking for something new and interesting to read. When I overheard a co-worker talking about how much she loved this book, I couldn't wait to read it. What a big let-down. Here's my take on this book:<br /><br />The writing was horrible: I can't believe this author was able to get a book published when her writing skills are so poor. I fought my way through about a third of the book, then I just couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />The characters were boring: Ana was dull as mud, and Christian was an arrogant, selfish jerk. I didn't care in the least what happened to either one of them.<br /><br />There was no story outside the sex: I've read books that had great sex scenes intermingled with an engrossing storyline and interesting characters. That was what I was hoping to find in this book. What a huge disappointment.<br /><br />Even the sex wasn't believable: Forgetting about character and plot and focusing just on the sex, I'm still disappointed in this book. The sex scenes just weren't very sexy.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|do not listen to the reviews that state &quot; no update boo&quot; because today the update came along with 10 levels plus utopia ( the planet in the update)  is themed of food which is even better . and don't worry once you finished with the levels you can go around looking for eggsteroids ( the angry birds space equivalent  to a golden egg)  or try to get 3 stars on all the levels you have completed or just buy another version of angry birds to play so buy the game!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had heard several people discussing this book and I decided to review a sample.  I am so glad I did not buy it. I am not interested in S & M and I really did not like the vibe of the main character. I read the 1st few chapters and then deleted this book. What is so great about someone being manipulated and changed into someone they no longer recognize, so someone guess can get their jolly's off.
0375869026|5.0|I read reviews on this and figured I would give a shot as a Read Aloud for my 4th grade classroom. Less than a week into it, I had 4 students come to class with a copy of their own. Now 3weeks later I have 8 students that have bought it. I am amazed how this one book has planted a new seed of reading in almost my entire class. It's full of 4th grade type humor (farting nurse) but at the same time very emotional (students actually cried) and very thought provoking. This book has sparked so many life lesson conversations. I intend to read this book next year as my beginning of year read aloud. I can't praise this book enough.

B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|No this movie was not perfect, but for the first time in about 20 years while watching a move, I hid my eyes and actually let out an exclamation twice - that is no small feat for me.  I don't get scared by scary movies, but this one scared me.  I loved the long slow build up, it was needed to make the scary bits really scary.  Oh man.  If you love, I mean really love, haunted house movies, revel in this.  I just might have nightmares tonight and I can't say that after having watched about a hundred other scary movies in my lifetime.  That's all I'm gonna say.  Be patient and stick with it.  I was glad I did.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|I finally got a chance to see this band in April of 2012 after waiting years. They did not disappoint. This CD, Surreal, had just come out a few weeks earlier. Four of the tunes on this CD were done at the concert. Had not heard the songs beforehand. Fantastic! 80% of the tracks have a great groove to them and the other 20% are very good as well, with a slower tempo. The vocalists are excellent, including Maysa, and the musical groove that this band puts out shows to me that Bluey Maunick, the group's founder and guitarist, has excellent writing skills. I have most of Incognito's CDs over quite a number of years and I would definitely recommend getting this one.
B007FOH7UU|2.0|* I am going to preface this review by saying that I am not just some casual Keane listener. Keane is my favorite band, which makes this even more difficult to write. I am not blind to the quality of their work, ready to give it 5 stars simply because it is the latest release from the band I love; a true fan listens with a critical ear. With that said, I'll get right to it. *<br /><br />This is Keane's worst album by far. The quality of their work has diminished since the release of their first two albums, \\"Under the Iron Sea\\" (UTIS) and \\"Hopes and Fears,\\" (H&F) both of which are masterpieces. Ever since then, there has been a readily palpable and gravely precipitous decline in \\"Keaneness.\\" By that I mean they seem to have gotten away from what made the first two albums great. \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" got the ball rolling downhill, and Night Train did nothing except to hasten the ball's decent. Night Train in particular was horrid, and should be renamed \\"Night Trainwreck.\\" The attempt to include rap and a Japanese flavor, while admirable, was ultimately a flop. I was hoping Keane would right the ship with \\"Strangeland\\" but am sorely disappointed.<br /><br />With the older albums, almost every song was fantastic, or close to it. With the newer albums, it seems like almost everyone can distinguish and agree upon the few songs which are good, and the rest which are simply filler, and aren't songs you listen to with any regularity. In fact, you probably skip over them as you play the CD. I didn't use to have to do that with UTIS or H&F, but with each passing album, I've had to do it more and more.<br /><br />I almost feel like this band is an imposter and the real Keane has been held hostage since the release of UTIS. It's just...not them; the music, lyrics, anything! I long for the halcyon days of the Keane of yesteryear, but with each passing album I become more jaded that we may never hear from them again...
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was a fast & wonderful read.  It had me hooked from the start.  Even though you aren't supposed to like Travis you can't help but love him.  I didn't want this story to end. I loved the story so much I bought it in paperback form too!!! Had to have it. :)  Also so very excited for Jamie's completion of Beautiful Disaster from Travis's Point of View!!! Will be buying that as soon as it is humanly possible.
B000FC13E0|4.0|I've read this one twice, and it freaked me out both times. It's pretty much the same plotline as \\"Jurassic Park\\" but with nanobots. Crichton is in rare form with this one, blending together hard science, engaging characters, unexpected twists, and nail-biting excitement.
B00006FDCD|3.0|Was this supposed to be scary, because I laughed during most of the movie.<br /><br />Guessing the book was better because this movie was just plain silly.
0307951529|5.0|This book speaks to you in a relaxed conversational voice, but don't let that fool you.<br /><br />Chris has done some great research here on building a business on the cheap.  Which is a reality for for most of us reading this book.  We want to do something great, with little cash, and this book shows you that it can be done and that it has been done.<br /><br />Many books like this are overblown with whiz bang schnazzy language to make you believe that you can build an empire in a day.  Chris does it better.  You know it's going to be a boat load of work, and this book shows you that it can be done, and that what's on the other side is achievable by anybody.  You just need to get started.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone just starting out.  It's a quick read and highly encouraging.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Did not live up to the 5-star reviews.  Interesting premise, good beginning, slows to a crawl - make that a L O N G climb - in the middle.  Ended up skimming the last book to find out the ending.  Liked it, but just barely.
B007L24T52|3.0|David did a good job of setting the scene in this novel. The sanctioned hits on targets is believeable, and so too the unsanctioned hit, which forces the book into another direction. The introduction of the depleted uranium I believe was an opportunity missed. And would have made a far more believeable ending to the book if this was \\"unpacked\\" and kept internal. I cannot explain this without giving the story away. But consider this: Take the unit involved and make them the reason and the main players in the ultimate hit.<br /><br />I suppose what I am trying to say is that the coincidental ending, while trying to justify all the characters involvement in the event believeable, was a disappointment to me. I was held captive by the main plot and the sub plot, the introduction of the lady friend and her involvement however spoilt it for me. Read the book and see if you agree with me regarding the ending..For me: To many forced coincidences.

0393088774|5.0|Here is a summary. We are in the recession because there is lack of demand. We are trying to save rather than to spend. But the money we save is not being invested. In a mild recession lowering the interest rate stimulates investments because the entrepreneurs can borrow money cheaply. But this recession is so deep that even though the interest rate is 0% it is not enough to stimulate sufficient investments. The funds are sitting idle in the banks. The solution is simple. The government has to borrow the money and invest it in infrastructure, aid to the state and local governments. When the economy returns to full capacity, the government can reverse the tax cuts. It will accomplish two things: prevent overheating and reduce the debt. The government should run a deficit in a recession and a surplus in a boom. The book is dead-on.

B007PS0X0W|4.0|Underworld awakening doesn't have many flaws. It gives a short paraphrasing of early prequels to continue the underworld saga. The film includes humans now involved in the battle with some twists and turns of similar kryogenically frozen plots and more family members included. The movie basically mainly involves the camera following around kate beckinsale while others help her try to reunite with her love then her daughter. I did enjoy it, however I thought the film could have been longer and more detailed. It seemed they did not spend that much time on this movie but kind of made this as \\"fast food\\" film. With that being said I'm a satisfied customer with this rental. I look forward to the next one. thanks. Godbless<br /><br />~shauns movie review

B007NESBK2|5.0|I had the opportunity to see this concert last year in Austin, TX and it was an amazing experience! I literally didn't want the concert to end. I was in the 9th row, directly centered in front of the stage which was excellent seating. The concert was set up to be up close and personal. Everything from the lighting, background video, audio and overall visuals were done in way that's indescribable. It totally took my husband's and mine breath away! I believe the lighting at this show was the best I've seen at any concert. The lighting and audio crew did an magnificent job!  The music, background video used for songs, lighting and Sade were totally in sync with each other. The concert had a very romantic feel to it.<br /><br />I absolutely love this band. It was really nice seeing Paul, Andrew and Stuart back together again! These three gentlemen on guitar, piano, and saxaphone will literally take your breath away! The guys performing background vocals were also phenomenal! I was totally in awe throughout the concert and had to pinch myself to make sure I was actually there! Sade looked beautiful and her voice was nothing short of pure greatness. She performed all her classics as well as her new material. After attending this spectacular show, I already knew that if and when it came out on Blue-ray, I was going to purchase it immediately because it was literally one of the best nights of my life!
B004EPYZT4|1.0|It's very rare that you have a movie that can't grab me and I've often enjoyed everything the critics hated with a passion. However this movie is inexcusable and outright an abomination. Weak story, pathetic swordplay, the lead guy is about a charismatic as glue and I'm even sorrier to say that the ballbusting beauty who took out bad guys in GI Joe without a second thought is terribly dull. You buy or rent this for one reason - to see Conan and Rachel get busy in the hay. That's all you watch a piece of crap like this for. The specific effects can't even save this flick and there's no real menace, the villain is a joke. There are people in my neighborhood who are more menacing then that when unarmed!!! Congratulations to the producers, you managed to make Arnold's performance in the original appear worthy of a belated Oscar Award and that's saying something.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|This app stinks!  The game is fun, but you cannot exit.  When I tried to go to Stuff and then select OPTIONS as a previous reviewer suggested the OPTIONS button didn't work.  I am probably going to delete this one.  Wish they would fix it because my daughter does like it.

B006QPX7UI|2.0|All the above movies are great films.  The reason for the 2-star is Amazon's terrible instant video feed. For ages, I didn't have any problem with your feed then you tried to fix something that wasn't broken.  As I stated in my Numerous emails to support the problem has to be on your end, as I get tremendous feeds from other online providers. I can stop an Amazon poor feed and then go to Hulu and get a great feed.  I am not upgrading to Prime Membership because of your poor instant video
B0071DJZZA|5.0|The Hunger Games is a delightful, violent book about Katniss Everdeen and what happens when she volenteeres to perticeapate in the hunger games. I enjoy this book and highly recomend it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I listened to the Power of Habit on audiobook from Audible and thought it was a great book. Habits are a incredible force and this book gives examples for individuals, businesses, and large organizations. Powerful and useful book.
1400069289|2.0|Initially I really liked this book, the science and new research was very intriguing. The kind of book I really enjoy.  Then in the second half of the book things slowly changed to something more ominous, corporations are using this research to establish a cult like workplace where everyone makes the same money, employees are brought to believe the company is their new \\"family\\" and everyone contributes similar to a tribe like scenario. People begin to participate adding their valuable ideas that makes the company millions of dollars, but stay on the assembly line and are supposed to be content that they helped the company out while the company makes millions of profits on their ideas and the managers get bonuses. ?  The only thing that seems to have changed is that the worker feels good about lining the already rich guys pockets.  I can see how a small perceived shift in perception is so valuable, to a corporation.
0307951529|5.0|Let me just sum up what I thought of the $100 Startup. I loved it.<br /><br />Chris has complied stories from 50 entrepreneurs who mostly started with $100 and now are earning over $50,000. I enjoyed reading their stories about how they became accidental entrepreneurs. These aren't people with MBA's or are trying to climb the corporate ladder. They value something more important. Freedom.<br /><br />Chris has created a life of freedom for himself and he shares in the book his wins and losses. I enjoyed the advice he gave because it's advice you can quickly put into action.<br /><br />If you're looking to start your own microbusiness or improve it, this book is for you.
0553328255|5.0|I'm not even sure how to write a proper review of this amazing collection.  It deserves 10 stars and is one of the best books I've ever read.  Sir Arthur is pure genius in my opinion and I'm now at a loss as to who/what to read after finishing this!
0385344228|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  I love a book that doesn't get bogged down, and this is beautifully paced with relatable characters and a \\"this-could-happen-to-anyone\\" premise.  Hope his next book is in the works!
B004132HZS|5.0|Best TV show ever! Can't think of anything that has been as great as Sherlock and have only seen the first episode of season two, but can promise it will be just as good.  Love the hour and a half length of each episode but hate there aren't more to watch!  The cast is perfect and chemistry between Sherlock and Watson is exactly what I imagined after reading Sir Arthur's books.  Everything else I see is quite dissappointing after watching this series!
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Basically, Gina should stick to fighting or modeling. Horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible directing. It has this rediculous 70s beat music throughout the whole movie, i dont know why? maybe to make the sound editing easier. I am amazed that Michael Douglas, antonio Banderas, and Obi wan Kenobi, and even the guy from the last xmen was in it. Real popular guys, such a chesse ball movie. Maybe sghe take some acting lessons and get a better director next time. I tried to watch the whole thing twice, i couldnt do it.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I purchased this to help when camping, and to make processing wood easier.  It does exactly that.  A bit too big for delicate work, but this thing could easily double as a crow bar.  I have no concerns regarding the quality of the blade, and it arrived razor sharp.<br /><br />Would definitely buy again.

B0070Z97LG|5.0|This was the best twisted movie I've seen in a while.  I can usually figure out the plot before the middle of the movie but this one blew me away!!
0345803485|3.0|The writing is terrible, redundant, amateurish, etc.  However, it's so surprising and off color in it's content that it will keep you reading.  Much like a sex flick, you read it for the sex, not the \\"talented screenplay\\" or the \\"acting\\". :-)
B007R0Y7VO|2.0|This was a good story, but the production was almost amaturish.  In the scenes where the horse was leaning to plow, unlikely things happened such as having the whole town coming out to this remote farm to watch the horse learn. Really now. Just too Disney like.  They looked like they were about to break out in song.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it.  Ive found books that are out of print I had been looking for to replace after a fire several years ago. Good selection of books.  So no matter what your instrests you will be able to find most of what you need. Great!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I ordered the CD for two songs I had heard on the radio, but when I put the CD in my stereo system I was amazed that EVERY song was worth listening to. Her lyrics have so much meaning, feeling, and passion. Let's not forget her simply divine voice. Adele has one of the most amazing female voices I have ever heard. 19 was a great CD, 21 was an even better CD, so I can't wait until her next CD is released! I am definitely purchasing the DVD of her concert at Royal Albert Hall. If anyone is contemplating about purchasing any of her music, contemplate no more.  Anything of Adele is with more than what it is being sold for. It has been years since I enjoyed every song on a CD...Adele is here to stay!
0345803485|2.0|I should have listened to my gut instinct. I was not planning on reading this due to 1. the mix reviews I seen on here 2. heard it was based on Twilight, and I read Twilight and was not a fan of that either and 3. the free preview I've read didnt catch my interest. OF COURSE, I ended up buying the trilogy asking myself \\"how bad can it really be? With all the hype, there MUST be something there that I can latch onto.\\" Throughout all reviews, there was one thing in common, this book is supposed to be a eroctic novel so I had high expectations in the sex department. BUT was I ever wrong. I read all 3 books, the repeative language, the lack of depth in characters and plot and even the sex scenes was a HUGE disappointment. Regardless to say this series has laneded in the bottom of books I will never re-read again pile. If you plan on reading this for romance and sex, this series not the way to go.<br /><br />Sad to say, I still do not understand the hype behind this series. And to think they are turning this into a movie?! Upside, congrats to the author on making it big (everybody got to make a living somehow right?) As for her next book? I'm going to pass.
0307951529|5.0|There are libraries full of business books that espouse grand ideas and theoretical recommendations.<br /><br />This book is the opposite. It's real actionable advice and case studies of people who have done it.<br /><br />Chris personally interviewed over 1500 bootstrapped entrepreneurs, studying their success and failures. He curated stories from over a hundred of those, pulling out the best lessons of their experiences (good and bad) with his own expertise and packaged it into a fun and easy to read manual.<br /><br />But be warned. If you read this book, your excuses for finally quitting the cubicle job you hate will disappear.<br /><br />Story after story about how all these unconventional entrepreneurs did it will challenge you to start that business you've been thinking of, probably as soon as you finish this book.<br /><br />My personal favorite part is the 39 step product launch checklist. That alone is worth the price of the book.
0449227421|1.0|I loved Ken Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", \\"World without End\\", and \\"Eye of the Needle- all were masterfully written and enjoyable to read. I started \\"The Third Twin\\" expecting the same caliber of writing and was quickly disappointed. It almost seems like someone else wrote the book. First of all, it takes place in America and none of the characters introduced in the first 50 pages are believable. They are cardboard cutouts of how an outsider might picture Americans. The dialogue is maybe at a high school level of expertise. The book was so awful I stopped reading it. I wonder if Ken Follett has been lured by his publisher to crank out books with the help of a ghostwriter just to make a buck. I hope not, but the alternative is that he is either losing interest in writing, or losing his edge as a writer.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|The game is great. I haven't been able to stop playing. Everyone I try to I end up just wanting to play even more.

0307951529|5.0|As someone who started a stationery and greeting card business on less than $100, I approached the $100 Startup with much interest. I was pleased to discover that there were many others out there like me, who had launched their businesses on little capital, and that there was a term for our types of businesses: \\"Microbusiness.\\"<br /><br />Guillebeau starts out with the assumption that you want a change in your life and want to work for yourself, but you don't know exactly what you want to do. He then guides you through the process of figuring out what it is you could do (the convergence between your skill set/passion and what others care about). The book then discusses how to market your business (by translating what your business provides into a benefit for the customer), how to discover what it is your customers really want and how to sell it to them, how to work from anywhere, how to price your product/service, how to launch the product/service, and how to tackle business growth. Along the way, Guillebeau provides concrete examples of people who have been there and done that, so to speak, and walks us through how these people have approached the above steps.<br /><br />What I found most valuable about the book was Guillebeau's insight into pricing. In my industry, we commonly hear that your wholesale price should be cost of materials + labor, multiplied by 2 or 2.2. However, Guillebeau recommends basing your pricing on benefits, not costs.<br /><br />I also found the guides to the one-page business plan and the 140 word mission statement very useful because it gives you a structure that doesn't appear so intimidating. I've definitely put off writing a business plan for weeks and months on end, and I imagine others are the same. Guillebeau also includes a \\"decision-making matrix\\" that allows you to evaluate the passion level, profitability, and effort of your ideas for the business, and ultimately, whether you should go through with them.<br /><br />If there is one negative feature of the book, I would say that all the success stories profiled in the book can be a little overwhelming (sometimes overwhelming the message of the chapter). They could also lead many people to think that starting a business is easy and with minimal time and effort, you could be raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars. Maybe in some cases that's true, but not in the majority of them.<br /><br />Guillebeau acknowledges that entrepreneurship is not for everyone, and sometimes it's best to pursue your passion on the side while earning a steady income. He also concludes by urging microbusiness owners to give back to their community and help others, and even gives names of specific charities to which he contributes.<br /><br />This is a great, inspiring guide to starting a business. I'd recommend reading it along with books that are specific to your industry.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|If your looking for a lightweight Slim case to protect your you Kindle without adding bulk this is by far the best bang for the buck.  Those that complain about feeling cheap should update their post because they are letting its lightweight design fool them into thinking it is cheap.  Mine has been rock solid after heavy use for over 6 months.  I never bought it for the stand function but I have not had much issue with it the limited number of times I have used it but could see why it might not fit the bill if you NEED the stand function.<br /><br />Bottom line: It is GREAT protection for the Fire and you can't let the lightweight feel of it fool you as it is rock solid and looks nice as well.

0307951529|5.0|When Chris's first book came out, I absorbed his stories and advice on how to think for yourself. In his newest book, The $100 Startup, he takes the big picture described in his first book and breaks it down to the nuts and bolts. Chris's insight into the paths people have taken to become independent and self-reliant is practical and approachable, just like his writing and just like he is in real life. This book is for someone who wants to start. It's not always glamorous, but often uplifting. Some of the recommendations are obvious and you've probably already thought of them. However, Chris shows that thinking is just the beginning. The $100 Startup is the action plan.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|SO it has taken me forever to watch this move, mostly because I don't own it. I ended up borrowing it from a friend because I was getting sick of seeing it on TV and missing the entire first half because I didn't know it was going to be on. So frustrating. But I'm glad I finally borrowed the movie because I loved it! It had great acting from Heath Ledger who was an amazing Joker and lots of action, but there was some humor in it too. So overall, it was a fantastic movie and I would suggest you watch it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Games are great for kids and adults! Great for teaching coordination and problem solving to kids while having fun and is also fun entertainment for bored grownups!
0345803485|3.0|I had to read this to find out what all the hooplah was about, especially when it had to do with sexually explicit content! And that it was! Some of the devices used by these people made me laugh, who knew?  The plot, if you can call it that, was really just an age old love story reworked with different bells and whistles,(whips and chains, handcuffs and well if read the book you know the other stuff). Don't read all three back to back, the first book was almost astonishing, the second book became predictable, the third book, well I had to put it down for awhile and get on to other reads. Maybe when I pick it back up to finish it it will hold my attention again.

B000JQUQZO|4.0|It is great that a person in the year 2012 can get access to and read the inner thoughts of a roman emperor who wrote the thoughts over 2,000 years ago.  Wisdom is always needed even if it is old and especially from a famous and very successful military leader.  I find the old ideas very easily translated into today's working world and it shows that the old problems still exist in today's business and personal life. Well written and very clear the 'thoughts\\" provide a general and specific road=map to modern applications.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series and a quick read.  I got through all 3 books in a matter of 12 days, but mostly becuase they were that good I couldn't put the book down!
B0038P59A0|5.0|When the first film in this series was released, I headed for the theatre, only to be grossly disappointed. And bored to tears, almost! So when SH: A Game of Shadows was released, I decided to wait until it came out on DVD. Big mistake, for having watched it, I now wish I had seen it on the big screen. A Game of Shadows is one of the most enjoyable films I have watched in years. It is exciting, funny, adrenalin pumping, entertainment from beginning to end. The action never lets up! And Robert Downey Jnr is simply brilliant as Holmes. Downey's dishevelled portrayal is precisely the opposite to what we have come to expect from film makers down through the years, and despite what often comes across as a send up of the famed Conan Doyle character, once you get caught up in the film, all that is forgotten, and Downey becomes Holmes in every sense. Downey as an actor has played some truly memorable roles over the years, & his private life has not always endeared him to film makers. Yet in recent years he has not only regained much of the ground lost by his erring ways, he has come back even stronger, & proven that he is an acting force to be reckoned with, in point of actual fact, one of the finest actors in the business today. And in SH: A Game of Shadows, he throws everything into it, obviously relishing the role of Holmes. Guy Ritchie as Director, has proven again that he is capable of excellent film making, & I hope he has plans for yet another chapter in the Holmes saga.

B005LAIGN2|5.0|I have spent some time reading the other reviews for Red Tails, and I must admit that I am surprised at those that gave it a less than 3 star rating. I guess you just can't please some people. I say this because Red Tails has just so much going for it. Based on the famed Tuskegee Airmen, it is an exciting depiction of war in the air, with a great cast, top notch screenplay, and absolutely outstanding computer graphics, courtesy of George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic team, who are simply the best in the business. It all seemed so bloody realistic! As for the cast, well, they were great. Led by Terence Howard & Cuba Gooding Jnr, they faithfully portrayed a group of young negro pilots, sidelined by the US military because of their colour, & the false premise that they lacked the courage & intelligence to fly against the best pilots that Germany could produce. But when they are given the opportunity to act as cover for the long-range bomber groups, they finally get the chance to prove their worth, and they do it in style. The battle scenes are superb & among some of the best computer graphic action you will ever see. I loved Red Tails, & if great war action is your bag, then watch this film; you will not be disappointed.
1416550534|2.0|I loved the last few chapters of the book, but was befuddled as to why so many mundane conversations were painstakingly laid out between characters that had little to no connection to the plot that I could figure out.  It was a tedious read, but had some moments of greatness.  I may read her 'garden' book, that had better reviews, but if it is not better than this book, I won't bother reading anything more from this author.
B00008977N|5.0|This is a concert crossed with a theatrical performance.  Paula Cole and chopsticks on the bass...this is one of those shows you will watch multiple times.  Great sound the DTS 5.1 really is a nice addition.  If you have a good system crank up sledgehammer
B003R50F00|5.0|A great read for someone likes something different! It is certainly one of the best books I've read in many years. It paints a picture of the war from German people's perspective. With a very distinctive style, it reminds us of the strength and resillience of mankind.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|This is a new combo I've not seen before a stoner fantasy movie.  Great idea, Danny Mcbride is the best.  Perfect for Saturday afternoon with a fat sack. This is not a movie to be taken seriously so don't expect a lavish plot or deep characters. Nonetheless if the title made you interested then by all means buy it.

0307951529|5.0|I would love to write a bunch of beautifully scripted words about this book, but it just would neither truly reflect this book nor do it justice.  So, I will just make this as concise and straightforward as the book is.<br /><br />I've spent a ton of time laboring through free video seminars of big names of people who live amazing lives, work from anywhere they wish to travel with that now so predictable \\"hook\\" to compel you to buy into their brand of \\"school\\" or \\"association\\" or \\"academy\\" etc. that cost thousands of dollars even with their \\"buy now\\" discounts! None of which I can ever afford however try to use the \\"Free\\" content they so generously offered. But all it was, was a taste... part of the hook.<br /><br />Tired of that nonsense?  So am I!<br /><br />When I first learned of Chris Guillebreau's book The $100 Startup... My immediate thoughts were... \\"This is too good to be true.\\" and \\"What is the hook?\\"  Once I got the book in my hands, I realized, Chris is delivering an amazing value to anyone either thinking about starting a business, struggling for direction and steps to launch and even those already in business that need to make some shifts to gain some momentum! The book is an easy read.  No big words or trendy words.  This is straight forward, nothing fancy common sense with the nuts and bolts of what you need to start ANY business!  Even the graphics are crisp, clean, nothing fancy and communicate a powerful message within themselves.  The book contains clear concise background information - just what the reader needs and nothing more; then goes on to give the reader action steps.  The plans are easy to find because they are in gray boxes - so a reader can read through the book and then come back and easily find the task lists.<br /><br />What sold me on the credibility of the content was that this is not a \\"How I Did It\\" book by Chris Guillebeau.  Chris interviewed several successful business owners that fit a list of parameters - must be successful (duh) and he specifically tells you what he defined as successful by how much money the businesses were bringing in the last two years.  Also the business has to be small (no more than 5 people - most of them were less) with little or no start-up cost.  I also normally fall asleep with nuts and bolts type books with boring step by step stuff... However, not with $100 StartUp! This book was very engaging and interesting!<br /><br />I was once told in a class that when writing a review to lend credibility to my review I should find something I see room for improvement.  The only thing I could come up with?  That it didn't come out sooner!<br /><br />When Chris in the book gives his One Page Business Plan in his illustration at the beginning of the chapter - there are two steps on a sticky note in the illustration.  I am not going to give away the secret.  But his entire book basically tells you how to do the first step and the second step is the reward for the first step.  This is one of the smartest books I've ever read with content that exceeds any other that I've ever read, seen, heard that is out there - and I have researched a lot! It was Chris' book that moved me to action because it told me \\"how and now!\\" I'm in the middle of a business launch right now that I would probably still be sitting on had I not got my hands and eyes and brain around this hot little book!<br /><br />Buy the book! How is that for straightforward! I immediately started telling and texting and messaging friends to buy this book before I even finished reading it!  I could not stop talking about the genius contained on the pages within.  And now I'm telling YOU!<br /><br />Share this review with anyone you know in business for themselves or thinking about starting a business  and if they follow the advice... They will come back and thank you!(duh) and he specifically tells you what he defined as successful by how much money the businesses were bringing in the last two years.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this book at the suggestion of friends while at a bridal party. It started out really slow but picked up very quickly and I finished the book and began the 2nd. Christian and Ana are a breath of fresh air and helps you realize that dom/sub are not as dirty as people think.
1612130585|5.0|Don't call me while I'm reading this book!!  I found myself analyzing Christian - why he is the way he is.  I questioned myself!  How can I find this story so intriguing???  I couldn't wait to get to the third part of the trilogy - and this one wasn't even as good as the first one!  Ladies!!!!  It's a must read!
0670022411|5.0|This is one of those rare books that you simply can't put down !! A great read and never a dull moment . Can't wait for the next book in the trilogy .
1612130607|5.0|While this part of the trilogy wasn't as compelling as the other two, it was good to have everything come together.  I found myself wishing that it wasn't the end.  I want more, E.L. James!!!

B0055PGUYU|4.0|About 2/3 of the way through this one, it's KILLER... Very good, insightful, and very applicable for anyone looking to improve themselves, their internal conversations, their interactions and companies, and even relationships and life in general. Started off reading \\"listening\\" to this on Audible, half expecting a dry read, but it's a very good listen and I'd be surprised if you didn't find something actionable within the first few minutes that could improve your life, improve your performance at work, better your business, or help you frame something correctly for your child. Really a killer book. I'll listen to this one a few times....
B0060D0IYY|5.0|I was alot younger than I am now when I first saw this movie, when I first saw this movie...I was like wow! How cool! There is one scene in the movie that makes me cry, but it's a good cry, The actors and actress's are amazeing! I will never get rid of this movie! Lol
B000JQU1VS|4.0|i quite liked the book as it was about alot of adventures that both Sherlock and Watson had together, It showed a need from Sherlock for Watson to be with him.
B0000072VI|3.0|I am a huge Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers fan. I have been as long as I can remember. I saw them not even two weeks ago at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival right in front of the stage. They were spectacular, and they proved why everyone must go see a Heartbreakers show at least once. These guys are all 60 or pushing 60 and they still have it. Go see them if you get the chance.<br /><br />On that note, I thought I'd review the now legendary 'Greatest Hits' album. This album is probably the album that every casual Tom Petty fan owns. I'll admit it -- this was the album that got me hooked on Tom Petty. It had all of the songs I had heard on the radio up to that point and a handful of tracks that seldom got played on the radio but were just as good as the radio hits.<br /><br />This album contains just about everything the easily-pleased Petty fan would want. 'American Girl,' 'Breakdown,' 'I Need to Know,' 'Breakdown,' 'The Waiting,' 'Refugee,' 'You Got Lucky.' They're all here. If you just want the Petty songs that you hear on classic rock radio on a frequent basis and those songs only, look no further than 'Greatest Hits.' It collects them all for you in a nice little affordable package and in great sound. The sound quality here is superb, better than 90% of CDs that are released in this over-compressed MP3 world (the \\"loudness war,\\" for the layman).<br /><br />Now, I've laid out the positives, here are the negatives.<br /><br />I love 'Full Moon Fever.' It revived Petty's career in 1989. The fact is, though, that it is not a Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers album -- it is a Tom Petty album. Sure, Mike Campbell plays on every track. Yes, I get that. But the rest of the Heartbreakers are absent (for the most part). So does it really make sense to put these tracks on a \\"Tom Petty & the HEARTBREAKERS\\" album? There is nothing from 1987's 'Let Me Up (I've Had Enough),' which admittedly is not his best work, but it is still the Heartbreakers nonetheless. 'Jammin' Me' and 'Runaway Trains' were both minor hits, and both could fit comfortably on this disc.<br /><br />It would be the same thing as releasing a Creedence Clearwater Revival greatest hits album and adding John Fogerty's 'Centerfield' on it, or releasing a Cream greatest hits album and putting Eric Clapton's 'It's in the Way That You Use it' on it. It just doesn't make sense. Solo careers are very different than the actual band. So, MCA should have added more from the 1976 self-titled debut, a few tracks from 'Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)' and perhaps a fan favorite or two (personally, I'd love to see 'Two Gunslingers' show up on a Heartbreakers compilation one day) to make this truly The Heartbreakers' greatest hits.<br /><br />The better title for this disc would be 'Tom Petty's Greatest Hits.' If you were to call it that, you'd have to add something like 'End of the Line' or 'Handle with Care' from the Wilburys album (Warner owns the masters of that, but they'd probably loan them for this greatest-hits project). So really, if you are a die-hard fan, this is a frustrating disc. It's really only worth it for the two new songs -- 'Mary Jane's Last Dance' and their cover of Thunderclap Newman's 'Something in the Air,' both of which are phenomenal. Rick Rubin produced both tracks and did so masterfully.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a casual Tom Petty/Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers fan who just wants the hits and nothing but, than 'Greatest Hits' will suit you fine. Otherwise, this is a somewhat frustrating and baffling compilation that focuses more on Tom Petty than Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers. The bonus track added here is 1976's 'Anything That's Rock & Roll,' a great deep album cut from the band's first album. Not a bad choice, but don't spend a ton of money for just that one track (just some friendly advice). It's not like it's an earth-shattering, collector's only rare song as the bonus track. It's the same version that's available on the debut which almost every serious Petty & the Heartbreakers fan owns anyway.<br /><br />The new-for-1993 songs are worth the price of admission for this disc alone. But really, it does frustrate me that 'Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)' got completely skipped over while 'Full Moon Fever' got plenty of recognition. A truly baffling compilation.ous Petty & the Heartbreakers fan owns anyway.<br /><br />The new-for-1993 songs are worth the price of admission for this disc alone.

B007EJ6S92|5.0|I just picked up the new Moonspell. I never imagined this band could get any better. I was wrong, Alpha Noir is the best of<br />2012 so far. From the opening track Axis Mundi to the final track Sine Missione, The cd hammers. The first single for the<br />disc (likanthrope) is the perfect sample of this album. I have to say you must buy the expanded edition, the second disc<br />Omega White is a nice, almost perfect reminder of the darkness and hope era moonspell. It is good to know that if you really<br />look, great music is still being made. 2012 has already given us the best Paradise Lost cd (Tragic Idol). We still have the<br />upcoming My Dying Bride, Saturnus, Katatonia and Therion. They all need to be perfect to come close to Alpha Noir. It would<br />be really nice for all the american metal bands to pick up Alpha Noir so they can see what true metal perfection sounds like. I'm sorry Metallica and Manson fans, this isn't your mtv poser metal. This is for the hordes of real fans, those who<br />follow Behemoth, Iced earth, Filth, Borgir, My Dying Bride and Solitude Aeturnus just to name a few. Get out there and let's<br />put that poser metal to rest. Moonspell will open your ears and expand your mind. Don't miss this cd.
B003N5ZIEM|2.0|This is not truly a hardcover book.  It is very flimsy and basically made of thin cardboard. Definitely not sturdy enough for repeated use with kids.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am done with Star Wars.  I'm packing it in.  No Blu-Ray for me.  The changes to the original films are utterly appalling.  I will simply remember the Star Wars films I saw as a child the best I can in my own head rather than re-watch this slap in the face.  Everything Star Wars that I ever own(ed), has now been placed in my attic where it will become old and smelly... and someday it will all be thrown away rather than passed down to my children.  Adios.
B0061C1NQ6|4.0|A pretty decent mystery, and in a very accurately imagined / depicted world of soviet Russia.<br /><br />The protagonist in particular is an excellently developed character.<br /><br />I enjoyed it.
0061703087|5.0|Crichton has constantly turned out quality novels and this one is among his finest.<br />The other many reviews have gone into the story so I will not repeat it here but will say it is like Jurassic Park with nanobots that are a hundred billionths of a meter, instead of huge clawed dinosaurs.<br />If you are a fan of Crichton's writing you are going to like this.<br />I have just finished reading [[ASIN:B007YLFXHS Amazon Adventure Novel Teaser]] and I can highly recommend it as a great adventure set in the Amazon Jungle - a quest to find Colonel Fawcett's Lost City of Z. And also [[ASIN:B0058EU0OE Beginnings: A Hunt for Treasure (The Tomb, the Temple, the Treasure)]]
B003XYERRM|5.0|Sure, most of the book is speculation and conjecture. But her main point is that the history of Richard III was written after his death, by his enemies.<br /><br />This \\"history\\" is as believable as any, and is entertaining to boot.

0240815807|5.0|I held off on buying this book for a long time, since I had heard of flashier and more excitingly named products claiming to give me the secret to \\"it all\\" in the home studio.  I really wish I could take back about half of those purchases now and just rely on this single book.  After reading through it and listening to the supplemental material to get context for everything that is explained, I feel more ready to mix than I have at any point in the past.<br /><br />As someone who clearly understands the limitations of a small-studio setup, Mike has effectively helped navigate those of us in this situation to get the best out of our gear and plugins.  Overall, I cannot say enough about the amazing process this book teaches you and I'm looking forward to re-reading this over and over again.<br /><br />-Jimmy
0439023513|5.0|I think Mockingjay was great, even though it started out a little bit slower than the first two books.  It is a little more thought provoking than the first two installments.  Can't wait to see the movie sequels...
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I haven't watched this collection. I have seen all three many times. The only reason I purchased it was to replace vhs tapes.
0307951529|4.0|It's no small thing to start your own business. Whether it be through necessity or desire, there's always something deeply unnerving about that leap into the unknown. What's most useful about Chris's book is its practicality and its stories. Look what other people have done. Their plan won't be your plan, their journey won't be your journey, but they show you ways and means of getting something going when you thought you couldn't.
0307951529|5.0|Firstly, clear disclosure - I consider the author a friend and have often received great business advice from him.<br /><br />So, I wasn't surprised to see the level of detail and careful consideration in this fantastic book.  I would have loved to have had some of these tips and resources when I started my business 5 years ago - it would have saved some heartache!<br /><br />What makes this book different than most business/entrepreneurship books is that Chris provides clear, specific advice that is very actionable - you could go out tomorrow and implement many of his suggestions.  Secondly, he also interviewed hundreds of businesses, so the book has working examples of how these businesses not only survive but thrive.<br /><br />If you choose only one business book this year, choose the $100 Startup.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on my Fire.  Has random ads at the beginning of each game -but they short.  One ad was more like a full commercial.  Still a great game.  Options for regular rules or Vegas,  1 or 3 draw,  accumulating scores,  quick finish/fill when you've won,  auto move,  undo,  a choice of backgrounds,  and a choice of decks.  There's a few more options,  but I didn't mess with them.
0307951529|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! I loved every minute of it. Even if you dont think you want to start a business, I believe this is a must read because it is one a very easy read, and two, it is filled with amazing info about how to start a business, without a bunch of investors. I am keeping one for myself and ordering more to share with friends.
0307951529|5.0|I work as an academic advisor at a small community college and am constantly referring students to this authors other book \\"The t of Non Conformity'. This is another great book along similar lines which I will undoubtedly be using in the classroom from time to time. Chris talks frankly and honestly about several people who have started successful businesses for a few hundred dollars. The message is great, the writing is straight forward and I read it over the course of a few days so it is obviously an attention keeper. I recommend for anyone who wants to start a business but thinks \\"there must be a less complicated way to do this\\"<br /><br />As a side note: The artwork in this book is painfully cheesy, I won't dock any stars from it or anything, but it is seriously painfully cheesy early 90s computer graphic kind of artwork, luckily it is only one every chapter so it is totally possible to ignore.
0785162348|5.0|The Art of the Avengers is a must-have for anyone who a-loves Marvel Films, or  b- loves book about the making of movies. The book is exactly what you want, with great art, making-of images, and a great deal of insider information including interviews and commentary by the core production team. The writing is perfectly suited for armchair Marvel historian and amateur alike. The Art of Marvel books have been treats, but the Art of the Avengers is the Christmas morning of Art of books. I certainly hope that the next Marvel art of books follow the same format.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is a great game the extra gold buys are cheap only two bucks for 50 thousand bucks it works smooth and its fun I love it try it out
0671027344|5.0|When I finished reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I wasn't really sure I liked it. After a couple days, I realized that I loved it. The main character, Charlie, was realistic and I felt like I was able to relate to him even though many of the things he went through I've never been through, which isn't something I'm used to when I read a book.<br /> I loved the writing style. When I first started reading it, I didn't think I'd be able to get past the fact that it was written in letter form. Eventually, however, I didn't really notice it because it felt more like Charlie was talking directly to me instead of me reading one of his letters. I felt like I actually knew him, like he could actually be real. The book was just so well developed.<br /> Another great thing about this book was that while it dealt with some serious issues, the book as a whole wasn't too sad or serious. There were some funny parts in the book that made me laugh. I read this book in one of my classes and I had to stop reading when I came across a funny part because I didn't want to start laughing and have the people in my class look at me like I was crazy.<br /> There wasn't really anything I disliked about the book. I would recommend it to anyone, especially other high school students.

The title clicks now at the end of the ep.  I hope you get to watch this show and are as surprised and satisfied with it as I was.
B002RVZV9K|3.0|I was really hoping there would be more footage and interation between the three, and there is some, but mostly this is three standalone biographies (each very well done) that would probably have been much more suited for three one hour presentations on The Biography Channel.

0812968255|4.0|I have been reading and re-reading Marcus Aurelius' Meditations for years. The translation in the Penguin edition always suffered from a kind of stiff literalism. It was as if the translator wanted to make the Meditations a more formal work than it is.<br /><br />Gregory Hays, in his translation of the work, pitches the idea that the Meditations was never meant for publishing, and as such, varies in formal style and quality. He tries to capture this in English, by switching from somewhat stiff, philosophical language in some parts, to a more conversational tone in others. He wants us to see the Meditations for what he believes it is: a kind of self-help book the Marcus Aurelius' wrote for himself; a reminder of what his goals were and how to achieve them.<br /><br />This makes Hays' Meditations a much easier read than its predecessor; he gives Marcus' voice a freshness and immediacy that is missing in other translation. Most importantly, he give new life to the voice of a Roman emperor who lived nearly two-thousand years ago.

0307951529|5.0|If only I had read this book three years ago!<br /><br />I was a bit of a reluctant entrepreneur. Trained as a physician, I became increasingly disillusioned with the pitiful state of our broken health care system, so after eight years of working as a full partner in a lucrative managed care medical practice, I took a leap of faith and quit my job, even though I was the sole provider and income-generator for my husband and newborn daughter. What ensued was a circuitous path back to myself that led me to become a work-from-anywhere entrepreneur/author/blogger.<br /><br />Unfortunately, having not read The $100 Startup and knowing nothing about building a small business, I invested way too much money in creating a heavily-trafficked website that didn't actually generate revenue. Fortunately, after two years of mistakes, I met some entrepreneurs like the ones the author describes in The $100 Startup- scrappy, creative people who built successful online businesses without going into serious debt like I did. What I learned from them- much of what is described in helpful and inspiring detail in this book- allowed me to take my business out of the red and transform it into a six figure business I can run from anywhere. Even so, reading this book left me inspired! Many things nobody has yet taught me about running this kind of business jumped out at me from the page.  Unlike many business books, it's not a rehashing of what everybody else has already said. And just like Chris Guillebeau's wildly popular blog, the book is written in an approachable style anyone- even a reluctant entrepreneur like me- will track with.<br /><br />For example, I think I'm one of those who has made the mistake of not \\"giving my clients the fish.\\" The analogy the author makes is that people come to a fancy restaurant, hungry for the fish special. They want to sit down, have a glass of wine, and let the chef prepare a beautiful meal the waiter will then serve. But what if the chef comes to grab you out of your seat and drag you back to the kitchen so you can kill, debone, and cook the fish yourself? Uh...no thanks!<br /><br />Instead, he invites you to consider the experience your client really desires, and instead of making them work for it, just give them the freakin' fish- which is all they wanted in the first place.<br /><br />That example, as well as many others, got me thinking about what I offer my clients and how I might enhance my offerings. My copy of The $100 Startup now has at least 3 dozen folded up favorite pages, about ¼ of the book is highlighted for future reference, I kept a notebook of inspiration and ideas for my business that this book inspired, and unlike most books I read, which get donated to the library as soon as I read them, this one will be staying on my bookshelf.<br /><br />If you're jonesing to get out of a cubicle- or even get out of your comfortable but unhappy doctor job- pick up this book and get out your highlighter. By the end of it, you just might have your one-page business plan, $100, and the chance to follow your dreams. Do yourself a favor- don't miss the invitation put forth in this book. I can tell you from personal experience, it's pretty dang blissful on the other side of taking a leap of faith.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great way to keep track of notes. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of help remembering things.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|Other reviewers have already pointed out that this is not a complete Beethoven sonata cycle but it certainly comes very close, with only five of the thirty two sonatas missing and, of them, only one \\"major\\" sonata (Op. 111) is lacking. All the \\"name\\" sonatas (plus many non-name ones) are here and for many people this will be their main concern. To most intents this is pretty-well complete. AND it offers a couple of bonuses in the \\"Eroica\\" Variations and the two early \\"Electoral Sonatas.<br /><br />The (near) cycle comes in a neat, compact package but with very little, unfortunately, in the way of notes or documentation. There is a brief essay on Gilels but nothing about the sonatas as such. Sound-quality is variable but generally good, a notch below Barenboim's DG cycle but leagues ahead of Kempff's 60's set. I can't agree, however, that it's anything like \\"amazing\\", as one reviewer has put it.<br /><br />This is probably the most technically authoritative recording ever made of these works. There seems to be nothing that Gilels can't simply toss off with aplomb. Not that there is any hint of overt virtuosity at play; in fact there's a sense of austere disdain about any need for \\"display\\". Gilels is a musician first and a pianist a very distant second; the piano is simply his vehicle for giving utterance to this music.<br /><br />This technical control means that there is never any ambiguity in Gilels' conception of these sonatas. His intent and his execution are one. The musical line and shape is always utterly clear and these recordings are unique in my experience for their elucidation of what the left hand is doing. With most pianists the bulk of the musical interest is concentrated in the right hand with the left relegated to some sort of fuzzy background; with Gilels you are always conscious that the left hand is very nearly an equal partner. I was continually surprised at how much \\"point\\" the left-hand \\"accompaniment\\" has in these recordings. It's never just an amorphous murk lurking behind the main melodic line.<br /><br />My only reservation is that there is a constant emotional detachment behind Gilels' playing. At times, indeed, his approach reminds me of a forensic surgeon doing an autopsy on a dead body. He sets out the musical shape in an overly objective and  distant way as though he detests the idea of any emotional display; there is little sense of ecstacy or reverence except insofar as the music compels it. Gilels never \\"milks\\" the music. He never attempts to make it \\"beautiful\\" or \\"dramatic\\" or \\"titanic\\", as many other interpreters try to play it. It's as though he thinks it far too fine and pure to bring merely human emotion into it and some listeners may find this inhibits their own response. They may admire rather than love it. Even so, I think this is an essential set for anyone who has fallen for these sonatas; it offers something that nobody else does to anything like the same extent.n amorphous murk lurking behind the main melodic line.<br /><br />My only reservation is that there is a constant emotional detachment behind Gilels' playing.

B001QL5MAA|4.0|The main reason I'm choosing to write a review (which I rarely do) is to express sincere displeasure with the Kindle adaptation. I thoroughly enjoyed the book--it was a surprisingly complex space opera.  Although many of the characters lacked the depth that I would have liked to see, the core group was well developed and I enjoyed the book cover to cover.<br /><br />However, I'm not sure whether the Kindle edition was rushed into existence, but the number of misspellings and typographical errors is pretty unacceptable. I can hardly go a page or two without a word being misspelled, needlessly hyphenated, improperly capitalized, or other such nonsense.<br /><br />I'm not a professional proofreader, but even a cursory readthrough should have made it easy to correct these mistakes. It might seem like a little thing (obviously it is, I can only justify taking off one star for it), but \\"annoyance\\" is not an emotion you really want to feel while reading a book.

This is best seen where he fist meets Salander - In the book (and the Swedish movie) he comes to her place and wins her over (just a bit at first).  It the Hollywood version he comes swaggering in like a cowboy, Salander would have hated him and the rest of the story would have never happened.  This is just the most obvious example.  The ending is completely trashed and does not even make sense in this movie.<br /><br />The American cut of the movie is badly done and does not make sense and drops some critical story elements (like the ending !!!!) so do yourself a favor and watch the Extended Edition of the Swedish version (it has an English dub or Swedish with subtitles).<br /><br />I'm not saying the acting in this movie is bad, it just has nothing to do with the book.  On the other had the editing is horrible and the cinematography is not well done.  (the Swedish version is much better technically as well).<br /><br />In short, another \\"foreign\\" film trashed in a Hollywood remake.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Looks like \\"Uncle George\\" is hypeing his special effects studio to get more $$$$ by re-cycling another movie done better by someone else.<br /><br />Get the Tuskee Airmen DVD ( original movie ) instead of this oh, so obvious, retread / remake.
1741798981|4.0|We're big fans of the Lonely Planet Guides having used them on about 6 trips. My daughter will be using this for a trip to London in a few weeks and having been there myself this edition seems to have all I would expect. They tend to be practical, approachable, and to the point. We usually buy several guides and bring this one with us.
0307951529|5.0|I was really excited to read Chris Guillebeau's newest book, \\"The $100 Startup\\". The book is chock full of examples of people who break out of their day jobs to create successful businesses--often on a shoestring budget. This is no less than the documentation of a movement---a movement to retrieve one's own personal power and create a life, a business, and a dream on your own terms. I loved this book! The businesses showcased are in a wide range of fields--each entrpreneur featured has a unique story and method of creating their business and breakthrough. \\"The $100 Startup is not really a \\"how to\\" book, but  many useful tips are shared and the individual stories are full of inspiration. Highly recommended!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read at least 5 books a week and I can tell you this is one of my favorites!  Great characters and story line.  I read Slammed and it's successor in 24 hours.  Couldn't put it down until I knew what was going to happen with Lake and Will.  If you are considering this book, just hit purchase now, you will not be disappointed!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm a strong believer in professionally published and edited books and I have been wandering (or clicking) around the first of these stories for a long time. Intrigued by a load of outstanding reviews, but always not quite convinced. Waiting for another flight a week ago I finally gave in and bought the original \\"Wool\\" - if it wasn't good I wouldn't be a big waste of money or time. I read the it on the short flight and bought the sequel at my next stopover in Baltimore. This probably was the best start I could have had into the world of independently published books. It is a captivating story with believable (not necessarily likeable) characters and a detailed (albeit small) world to explore. Admittedly the second part was a small let-down and I still don't think it fits well into the rest of the line. But other than that there are only a few minor flaws in the presentation, the believability, the history, and the motivation of life in the silo. At least nothing that I can't overlook if it helps create an engaging atmosphere. Although I had already bought the fist two parts, I don't feel I wasted money on the omnibus. This is good quality for a more than fair price.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is the best game in the world its even better than angry birds! its exactly like Mario except way better!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|She still bites her bottom lip.  He's still a control freak.  In the follow-up to Fifty Shades of Grey, Anastasia Steele finds out a lot more about Christian Grey and what caused him to be the way he is.  What she learns causes her to question her relationship and what she is willing to tolerate for (and from) the man that she loves.<br /><br />I liked that both characters admitted that they needed each other and couldn't imagine being without each other.  I have become addicted to this series; every time I tried to find a stopping point in the book, something else would happen, and I would continue on.
B0079R8KO0|3.0|The functionality of this is fine. It does what it's supposed and protects your Fire and allows for multipurpose viewing. I just didn't like the look and feel of the material on the outside-personal preference. I would have expected the price to be less for something that seemed cheaper in appearance.
0439023521|1.0|I agree with the other negative reviewers.  There is nothing remotely satisfying about any of these books.  Not only is the premise of the first book rather disgusting, the second two are just horrible.  I had to force myself to finish the third one.  I'm posting this here in the first book to save readers some valuable time!<br /><br />Ms. Collins' writing is flat, plot twists are contrived, characters are almost completely under-developed and her solution to writing herself in a corner is to simply make up some new fantastic weapon or unrealistic plot turn.  The main character is boring and unemotional. I honestly don't see why these books sold so well.<br /><br />Perhaps most distressing, the novels read like a bad high-school term paper.  If you consider Uncle Toms Cabin as a shining example of how to craft the English language, this trilogy could serve as the polar opposite.<br /><br />Do not read.  The author and publisher do not deserve your time or money, at any price offered.

B004SKQAJI|2.0|I have seen LOTD 6 times live..all with Michael; also the 'egyptian\\" version of Feet of Flames live, and hundreds of viewing of LOTD and FOF on tape.Celtic tiger also, live.  The very best show, IMHO was Hyde Park, FOF.<br /><br />If I had a preview of this latest version, I wouldn't have bought it. I can't believe this was the show they took to THE POINT!<br />The dancing, and Michael was great, as usual..but the background 'scenery' was HORRIBLE. The flashing lights and colors blending in with the costume colors made it difficult to see the dancers, and the lights were hard on the eyes.<br />The costumes have not lived up to FOF either.  I disliked the bad guys costumes, especially, and missed the bare chest, beautiful short jackets previously worn by Michael.<br />If I were to suggest one of the shows for a new viewer, it would have to be Hyde Park FOF.  THe backgrounds evoked the mood of the scene and were clever and beautiful! The lighting and costumes were lovely. Why settle for second or third best with this version?<br />Michael is one of my hero's and this was a disappointment!

0307951529|5.0|Reading Chris Guiilebeau's book, THE $100 STARTUP is like getting an MBA creative style in bite-sized actionable chunks that inspire me to action and how me see how my dreams of service and freedom can be real now! I haven't finished the book yet, though I will! I recommend this book to anyone ready to dive into the world of getting what they want now. I'm giving this a 5-star review because it's so practical and useful. Why wait to create the freedom you want now and be of service to the world now? I'm recommending this book to everyone I know, including all my Artist Entrepreneur clients!
B007NZDES0|5.0|I've never written a review in my 48 year life about any \\"Live\\" performance but I feel strongly about giving recognition to this Stellar performance (Phoenix 2011). On all levels their performance was spectacular, even if you haven't been a huge \\"Fan\\" of Sade in the past, I think anyone that has the opportunity to view this show (DVD) will walk away with a new appreciation for not only Sade but for her extremely talented Cast of bandmembers. They surely appear to really like each other and richly compliment the whole performance both individually and as a group. I have been to more concerts than most and I can honestly say that this show was at or very near to the top for both my Wife and for myself, DON'T MISS IT!.
1423113454|5.0|I recently read the Red Pyramid and it was really good. It was written by Rick Riordan and is fantasy fiction. The main characters are Carter Kane who is a kid that traveled with his dad until an accident at the British museum. Sadie Kane is Carters brother who she was separated from after their mom dies and goes to her grandparents who live in London. There is also Sadie and Carter's dad who is kidnapped by the evil god Set in the beginning of the book. Also there is Set the big evil guy in The Red Pyramid. I think that it was a really good book because Riordan kept the plot going instead of just stalling like the Eragon series. I really anticipate the next books coming out.

145162445X|5.0|From now on, we will never have a serious ontological discussion without mentioning this book. We will look back at this book like a monument to science beginning to pull together one more gap of understanding. Agree or disagree--you must own this book.

0307951529|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2QNTNKNZR4Z1S]]I really enjoyed the $100 Startup. It encouraged me to think outside the box and left me with pages of notes for ideas. I literally had nights where I couldn't get to sleep because I was so excited about ideas for side businesses!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Written in an accessible, conversational tone<br />-Case studies from a wide range of successful entrepreneurs<br />-Excellent for motivation<br />-Helps you find your own unique way to be successful<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Won't give details for \\"how-to\\" for a specific businesses (licenses, logistics, etc.)<br /><br />If you want to start a business but have been putting it off, this is a great way to find some motivation and \\"just do it.\\" Chris doesn't sugar-coat and explains that this will require a fair amount of work. No one book can give you all the resources you need, but having the passion to get started is essential. I found this book incredibly useful for giving me the courage to just \\"take the leap\\" and get started.
B007Q2N0HA|2.0|I cannot believe this book has so many positive remarks/reviews....I did not care for this book at all. It is not even close to being as good as 50 shades . The only thing that kept me reading was the hope that it would get better as I went along ...I was wrong and I have no desire to read the 2nd book....I never cared about the characters in Bared as I did in 50 Shades ..Sorry
1451648537|5.0|[[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]]This book, while long,  is tough to put down. Fascinating and gripping for a bio.  Received as a gift and then purchased one to give as a gift.

B007DIQB50|5.0|I love the fact that Nicki is expanding herself into pop. She is a great pop star, possibly a better pop star than a hip hop artist. She has an incredible singing voice, she is diverse and a great performer. This album has rap and pop as well as a couple of silly joke tracks which show she has a sense of humor. Haters gon' hate but this album is great. It's the soundtrack to my life atm.

0307951529|5.0|This book is a dynamo of a guide to starting your own business on a shoestring budget. I've tracked Chris's work from the Art of Non-Conformity blog, to purchasing his Empire Building Kit, which served as the basis for this book. I can say without a doubt that $100 Startup shows that Chris is on an upward trend of producing ever-greater work.<br /><br />If you have ever thought of starting a business, quitting your job, starting a side-project, or any combination of the above, this book is for you. If you have ever wondered how people manage to make a living by pursuing their passion, this book is for you. If you ever need a push, pull, permission, or inspiration to do what you love, then you must grab a copy of this book today.<br /><br />Better than an opinion piece, Chris has diligently tracked the success of over 1,000 entrepreneurs in crafting this book. Specifically, Chris drilled down on 100 different small businesses to create a handbook for success in starting your own business.<br /><br />As a small business owner myself, I can say that I will keep this book nearby as a handbook for future success, and I would highly recommend you do the same!
B0054LVP3Q|4.0|A bit slow in the beginning, but worth the read all the way to the end for sure.  Very suspenseful and keeps you guessing and wondering right to the end.  Nice twist.

0307951529|5.0|Filled with case studies and processes of how to start a business by using the simple straight and concise approach. Now although it shows the methods to open a business and what kind of business only if you act on it, will you succeed. A great book for the library and a great book if you want to start a business....now!
0345803485|1.0|I picked this book up in the airport - and was excited to have it transport me somewhere interesting and sexy!  I can't get past the repetitive writing, however...  I can't read about Ana \\"biting her lip,\\" or \\"a ghost of smile\\" on Christian one more time... I may never know if she signs the contract at this rate....
0307951529|4.0|You'll want to be able to record all the ideas that start popping into your head as you read.  I suggest that you keep a notebook or your tablet handy to record those awesome ideas. As other reviewers have noted, this book does seem more geared to setting up an info based business (most of the profiled companies are not info businesses though). This is what Chris knows and does for his business.  However, with a little thought these tips can be given a little spin and put to work for other types of businesses.  There are many worthwhile tips in here for other types of business though, so I do recommend giving it a read.  And keep the notebook ready.
B004FOA84A|4.0|the only problem is that it took me an hour to beat the 1 level. It should be longer, possibly extending from the storyline where our leaves off about the grandpa wanting to show him so much. Great game and graphics, just too short.

0316056863|2.0|Tine. Tina. Tina. She's so cutesie, like a doll. We all loved her Palin schtick. She somehow cries out for your support. Even though she's a millionaire. Clever she is.  This book was written with help. She tries to become daring, but doesn't quite come off. Once in a while she even swears. OMG. In this book we see her past. She was an Ugly Betty only accepted by gays in the theater. In this book, entire classes and races are either good or bad. We read how Tina Fey stereotypes Gays, Men, Irish, Greeks and the whole world. She tells us over and over what an \\"Over achiever\\" she is. I wish she explained how SNL became so formulaic and hostage to stale sketches, bad acting and toilet jokes. Amy Proctologist and Tina were quite a pair. When it began SNL missed a lot, but the ideas were fresh and risky. Now they trot out the same ole.constantly Watch for the one with Mick Jagger and Steve Tyler at the beauty salon drinking Viagra cocktails.  Tina's 30 Rock is the new Mary Tyler Moore show. Remember Ted?  30 Rock has characters even more unbelieveable.

0345803485|1.0|More true erotica than romance, not a well thought out story. Many technical and grammatical errors that distract a reader like me. I want stories that have more plot than sex. Not this one. Hard to get past the set up stage and into the true reason for the book. Really don't know why it is such a hit. Sorry I bought the series.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I hate it because it didn't let me leave the stupid game and it didn't have what I wanted on it

0618918248|5.0|When I first read this book, I thought it was the most amazing thing ever. Now, as time goes by, I am starting to think that it is a bit less-than-perfect and perhaps just above average. This was the first book about atheism I ever read, and it really helped me solidify some of my opinions, but since then, I've read other things and my opinions have undoubtedly changed a bit. I thought the book was incredibly interesting, but there were a few things I didn't like, such as his definition of atheism, his response to the anthropic principle, and his relatively limited treatment on arguments for the existence of God. Still, even if you disagree with some of his points, you can't deny that Dawkins is an excellent writer. Read it for the witty, refreshing writing, if for nothing else.
006197806X|5.0|Delirium completely blew me away, so when I heard about the sequel I was beyond excited.<br /><br />Reading it didn't take more than two days, I'm a pretty avid reader. There are some major twists and turns, lots of new characters, a few surprises here and there, and some moments where you totally question the main heroine. This book is quite the ride, and I happened to enjoy every second of it.<br />The story took on a completely different turn from Delirium making you crave it even more.<br /><br />I would say the number one reason to read it, is for the cliffhanger. This is one of those cliffhangers where you would squeal and yell and feel giddy and be desperate for the next round. The events that lead up to the cliffhanger and prior to it are very important, and things take such a turn that you're almost throwing your book against the wall, frustrated that you can't know what happens next.<br /><br />I loved this book, I thought it was the perfect sequel. I can see how a few people may not totally agree with all of the heroine's actions because some of them may not look appealing or right, but that's just one more thing that makes this book all the better.
B0000844M8|5.0|This video was as described and arrived on schedule. The movie itself was interesting and fun to watch. My daughter and I are reading the book together and it was fun to see the video to supplement our reading experience.
0345803485|2.0|I'm amazed at the book's popularity since the unbelievability and redundancy already cited are just two reasons I could do better.  I am a published author but erotic fiction is something I have not considered writing until now.
1609613937|5.0|My favorite quote from the book sums up Dr. McDougall's philosophy on health, \\"I have often been asked, \\"You are a doctor, so why do you speak against the practices of fellow physicians?\\" The answer is simple: I never took an oath to protect the financial interests of the medical industry.\\"  Dr. McDougall dares to to tell us how to become healthy, and therefore put doctors, hospitals, and big pharmaceutical companies out of business!<br />The book details plant based eating that give you plenty of protein and vitamins, low fat, ZERO cholesterol, and nothing but pure energy. I have been eating this way thanks to Dr. McDougall, Dr. Caldwell Esslestyn, and Dr. T. Colin Campbell after I saw the Forks Over Knives Documentary in June 2011. I have never been healthier or had more energy - probably not even as a kid! I have completely reversed my obesity and type II diabetes and am off all my Metformin, now I am a diet controlled diabetic eating exactly as outlined by Dr. McDougall. I have lost 95 pounds, lowered my total cholesterol from 390 to 100, and am also off my high blood pressure medicine with a bp of 110/70.<br />The book includes a 7-Day Sure-Start Plan backed up by practical information on how to ready your kitchen, your family, and your life for this change in the way you eat, and includes nearly 100 easy-to-prepare recipes to suit every taste. The Starch Solution is different because it offers a way of eating that keeps you feeling satisfied. You won't feel hungry or deprived, because starches are not only healthy, they're also comforting and filling. This is a plan you can follow indefinitely--even when you stray by not following it 100 percent--and its benefits will be with you for a lifetime.<br />You owe it to yourself to read this book, and give it  a try. You will definitely be glad you did!

B007SGM084|1.0|Wow, I was all set to get this trilogy after hearing the fantastic reviews.<br />BUT... I can get the paperbacks for less than the download to my Kindle.  And with the paperbacks, I can share with my friends after I finish reading them. That alone makes it a fantastic deal versus the expensive download. I am disappointed that there isn't more of an incentive to use my Kindle.<br />So the bottom line is that I am going the old fashioned route and getting the paperback version.<br />I see that there are other reviewers saying the same thing and it is a shame that the book is getting bad reviews because of Amazon Kindle pricing alone.
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun game where you need both brains and logic<br /><br />however the pop-up ads are a pain. so is the pop-up to down load on your phone.  I always hit skip so why even have them.  looks like they are the most complained about things for this app.

0345803485|1.0|This has to be the worst book that I have read thus far.  The writing is juvenile, repetitive, and dry.  For an \\"erotic\\" effort, the author is remarkably coy about describing actual human body parts and actions. Additionally, the sex is incredibly vanilla (plain vanilla, not even with sprinkles!).<br /><br />The copy that I read was abandoned in public with a post it note that proclaimed it \\"FREE!\\". Thanks! You saved me $10. Unfortunately, I can never get back the 45 minutes of my life that I wasted attempting to finish reading this.
0307592731|3.0|If you are looking for an outdoor adventure book this is not the one.  I was dissapointed.  Being a long distance hiker myself I kept waiting for more about the hike and nature instead it was  about looking for someone to sleep with and drugs. The hike was not as wild as she was. Also I found the language offensive.  I was looking for a book my book club could read.  Not this one!  I am not sure why Ms. Strayed felt  that kind of language must be used over and over.  I can overlook a little language but that was way to much. The book would have the same message without the F%**#  and mother F*(+.  I'll keep looking for a good outdoor adventure book.

0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins manages to do what so many authors attempt but often fail at, creating a satisfying ending to a trilogy.  So many series stumble and fall apart at the end but this series is different.  Collins keeps the story moving forward throughout the book.  Some twists and turns are thrown in but they all flow naturally from the story and never feel fake or out of place.  Characters become defined and grow in new directions.  Some for the better and others for the worse.  The story even manages to feature good action but also say something about the nature of revolutions.  It's rare that a book can so well balance excitement and meaning.<br /><br />I wholly recommend this book to those who have finished Catching Fire.  It might be my favorite of the series.

0307951529|5.0|If you're looking to start a company on a shoestring budget, this is your top choice.  Chris has a way of making the process seem almost (dare I say) EASY.  If you've wanted to start a business, but didn't know where to begin, this is the place.  Someone here said it best, become and Infopreneur!
0307951529|5.0|Chris Guillebeau is great about providing inspiration and practical information. This book is a great road map for anyone who has considered starting their own business. This book shares stories of regular folks who started their businesses very inexpensively.  For some of these business owners it was a total jump from their current job (by choice or by recession. Others were looking to start a small side business that they wanted to grow. Some were pushed into jumping on their dream due to the recession and others finally figured out their passion and found a way to make it profitable. It includes stories of on-line only businesses, brick and mortar stores and more.<br /><br />If you are thinking about starting your own business but have been lagging because of concerns that you have to have it \\"perfect\\" before you get started, this book will motivate you to take the jump. If you have an idea, but are not sure if it will be profitable, this book has some tools to help you work through your idea. Bottom line, this book is a great value, well written and sure to become a go-to resource for those considering starting their own micro business.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I don't expect much when I pay $1.50 for a book but this time it blew me away. Usually an amateur author has 10+ five star reviews (from friends) and a couple of legitimate reviews from the public which drag the ratings down a bit. But this time, this guy really deserves five stars. Looking forward to your future books mate!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|addicting and there aren't any glitches as far as I can see. very pleased with the game. I recommend downloading. ninjas.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Been addicted to this game since last summer (2011).  By the most basic definition, it's a tower defense game, but with a lot of fun twists.<br /><br />I was saddened when I got my Galaxy Nexus, and was no longer able to properly play it.  As of recently, though, the app was updated for ICS, and now it runs like a champ!<br /><br />After a while, the selection of weapons (plants!) can become a bit overwhelming, especially with a limited number of usable slots and a large amount of zombie factors to consider, but push through it, and figure out what works, and I believe you'll be glad you took the time.  I've played it through several times, and still can't put it down.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Fast shipping, ordered sat night and received by tues morning. Great price for the DVD.  Just as it was stated - New.  It was sealed in perfect condition.  No complaints.  Thank you!
0307951529|5.0|There's a growing wave of people out there who are pursuing lifestyle businesses in order to live happier lives.  Whether this means running a business online, or simply turning a hobby into something profitable, Chris does an excellent job of telling the stories of real people who have made this happen.<br /><br />In the past I've heard people say this lifestyle is unfeasible, or there's no way anyone could actually start a business for less than $100.  As someone who has put into practice many of the methods and strategies that Chris talks about in this book, and started his own successful business for less than $100, I can assure you that it's completely possible.<br /><br />One thing many of us fail to realize is that the world has changed a lot.  Due to globalization and technology we are afforded opportunities that just weren't there even 10 years ago. Chris gets this.  Many of the people he profiled in the book get this, but I don't feel like the masses get this.  That's who will get the most out of this book.  People who want to make changes, start a business, but aren't entirely sure how to go about it.<br /><br />The $100 will give you the inspiration, the tools to get started, and most importantly will change you outlook on just what is possible.
0307951529|5.0|54 pages -- that's how far I was in The $100 Startup when I put the book down and started my own side business.<br /><br />The book is good, real good.  So I had a hard time putting it down.  But being so good, I had a harder time waiting to apply what I read.<br /><br />The very beginning of The $100 Startup boils down entrepreneurship to 3 basic needs: something to sell, someone to sell it to, and a way to get paid.  Simple, but critical.  It's not theory, but fact and it got my mind in overdrive.<br /><br />Also from early on, the book cites examples and case studies.  The $100 Startup draws from over 1500 interviews, so case studies abound.  All these examples hold up to a set of criteria that scream \\"Achievable success, by anyone, even me.\\"<br /><br />And that's just the beginning.  I'd love to tell you how the book ends, but I haven't finished it yet myself.  I'm too busy using it.  The $100 Startup inspired me to take action and fast.  And I can say, so far, it's worth every penny...and now more.

B007T2XC7A|5.0|The pace is pretty slow on some tracks, and a couple of them are bland. But for $5 bucks you get several great tracks. You'll find interesting arrangements and of course Norah's sweet, beautiful voice. I haven't owned anything of hers since her first album, and this is very different. I'm glad she's doing her own thing now and not tied down by listener expectations.
B006C1DH92|5.0|One of the great things about this app is that it is actually an extended fruit ninja by the same company. It is not a knock off and plays and operates just like the original. It has interesting/ fun gameplay, and is totally worth the .99$. Works great on kindle fire.<br /><br />Oh, and for those of you who get into this stuff, there is a whole new set of blades and backgrounds to earn!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun and well thought out. Nice relaxing background music too. The puzzles are hard enough to make you think but not discourage you. Keep the apps coming!

B00723NWJE|5.0|Love Norah's voice and been there and done that with a 25 year relationship.  I was devastated for several years, But I know that I am my own unique self more now and amaze myself every day how much I enjoy living without a \\"partner\\", my ex. I enjoy Norah and look forward to her journey knowing every song written I'll enjoy great art in the making. The mood of her songs is what moves me. I'll leave the creative genius of the writer of music and lyrics to others.  Live life, Norah! I'll be listening and listening.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Some of this movie is quite violent, graphically so.  But that's in the last third.  You have to sit through 2/3 to get there, and it is not worth it.  Most of the time you are witness to two or more humans defined by their taciturnicity and propensity to lingering non-blinking stares. They say a line, then stare for a minute or more at the line's recipient.  Then said recipient, also staring, will answer.  The process is repeated ad nauseum until the bad stuff happens.  Drive away fast from any thoughts of seeing this turkey.

B007CKNX28|3.0|I dont know if it's just me, but when I heard that Jack White was finally releasing a solo album I couldn't help but think that I would be hearing some of the infamous guitar playing he is known for ala White Stripes or even the Dead Weather.  Jack White has a guitar sound all to his own and he plays it very well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Blunderbuss doesnt have ANY of this guitar playing.  Sure, you might catch a ten second blip on a couple songs on this album, but for the most part the \\"blip\\" will be gone before you even really noticed it was there.<br /><br />WARNING:  \\"Blunderbuss\\" is NOT a guitar driven album.  It's a piano-driven album.  Think of a modernized version of Billy Joel with a Nashville tinge to him and this is what this album represents.<br /><br />The actual music on the album is your typical run-of-the-mill piano stuff that you can regularly hear in the indie bar scene in Collegetown, USA.  The only thing special to it is Jack White's vocals, but even that's not enough to save this album from mediocrity.<br /><br />For those of you who were wanting a Jack White album with actual GUITARS on it, then I would strongly suggest that you DO NOT buy this album because you will be grossly disappointed.  I cant help but laugh when I see Jack White on the cover on these \\"guitar\\" magazines promoting this album when there's really no guitars on the album at all.  Perhaps Im bitter because Jack White is one of the few remaining \\"Guitar Gods' out there who can just let it rip \\"live\\" and have it spellbound you........only to release a mediocre \\"piano\\" album.<br /><br />No guitars?  I'll pass.  The best songs on this album are the second song and \\"Love Interruption\\".......which....ironically.....are the only two semi guitar-driven songs on the album.  The rest of the album lacks creativity, intensity, or even some balls - which are all attributes that propelled Jack White to the place he is at right now in the music industry.<br /><br />Again, I cannot stress enough, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GUITER-DRIVEN SONGS!
B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|When I saw the preview for this I could not wait for it to come out. Then I figured it did poorly at the theatre due to bad timing. But that was not the case.<br /><br />It has poor flashbacks, poor casting (other than 2 people) and where is the music, romance or any kind of enemy to hate?<br />She is one dimensional (she can fight).<br /><br />In similar movies, An equally matched adversary or specialist is sent to take down the star of the movie. In Haywire the audience sees that the attacker(aka enemy) is not a specialist at all. Matter of fact Mallory (played by Gina Carano) actually replies, \\"They sent you?\\". And I know what she meant after the ending credits.<br /><br />The Casting Director did not do a good job. Other than Gina Carano and Michael Douglas you have a bunch of bad selections.<br /><br />Its a Jason Bourne type formula that was poorly executed. She's made for these types of movies and its time for a female version of Jason Bourne.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|This book was hard to put down. I found the concept fascinating, a futuristic spin on Roman times when men were sent in to the colosseum to fight. The author has an amazing imagination. Not a world I would want to live in!
B007PKOKTK|5.0|My kids love the movie, very funny, great for their entertainment, it's a movie not only for Easter time but also for any time of the year!!
B006E531X8|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the wall and have all three of these singles in their original versions, as well as some foreign pressings. I've never had a Record Store Day item I really wanted until this one.<br />I'm not really a fan of what Record Store Day has become.<br />What began as a joyful little 'holiday' where exclusive releases are issued to draw folks into their local brick-and-mortar shop is rapidly becoming an opportunity for labels to issue expensive, over-produced junk.<br />Take this box, for example. Nice idea, right?: all three singles in replica picture sleeves in a nice box with a poster and 45 adaptor. I fell in love with it too, but some things bother me...<br />1) The price, naturally. Around $50 and there are plenty to be had, even today. Waaaaay to much for a cardboard box and 3 45's.<br />2) And if you're a vinyl lover, it's likely not lost on you that records, though exponentially more costly than they were in their heyday, are not pressed well at all. n my set and one belonging to someone else I know, the plate for 'Hey You' was cockeyed to the point that it affects the music. For this kind of money, and considering that records are made in much smaler quantitiies, there's no reason that more care couldn't be taken in making these things.<br />3) Some of the mixes aren't the original single mixes. Another brick is a slightly different edit than the 45 issued in 1979 (isn't that the point of a replica?). There are a couple other examples too. The edit of Comfortably Numb is correct though.<br />For $50. fans should expect more. And even if this set was made better, it sure isn't worth $50.<br />Sad.
B0074YVW1G|4.0|Being an introvert, I really enjoyed this read. In fact I finished the book in a couple of days.<br />I found it informative and helped me to understand why I sometimes behave in certain ways. It could be really useful for those parents who have introverted children too.<br /><br />Definitely worthwhile.<br /><br />I watched the Susan Cain video at TED Talks which convinced me to buy the book.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book on the spur of the moment and because it was on the best seller list. I started reading it while driving home on Friday afternoon and finished it about 2.00am Saturday morning!  I have not read a book so quickly in a little while. I simply could not put it down. I did a little skipping of the some of the e-mail bits and the sex scenes that involved the dom/sub scenes. I really do not like, being a \\"vanilla\\" person. I quite disagree with one reviewer's claim that the there was more than 58% sex scenes. There is a lot of sexual banter between the main characters, which I found mostly funny and touching.<br /><br />I liked both main characters who were both strong, passionate and naive at different times - hence paradoxical.<br />I did not like the end. Left you hanging so I went out in my sleep deprived self on Saturday and bought the other 2 books in the trilogy. (and I am trying to cut back on my book purchases!). I am half way through book 2 now. I am getting a little annoyed with both characters but let us see where it goes.
B007KLEHUQ|5.0|If you're a huge Phil Collins fan and looking for approximately three and a half hours of concert fun, then do I have a DVD recommendation for you!  I've watched this 2-disc concert treat multiple times in the Boomerocity man cave and it's a lot of fun to watch and listen to.<br /><br />Phil Collins Live At Montreux 2004 is the must-have DVD collection for Collins fans.  The first disc it the actual 2004 concert at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and covers pretty much all the huge Collins hits and is book-ended (to use Collins' own words) by battling drum solos that are worth the price of this collection all by themselves.<br /><br />However, the hits are what the audiences and purchasers of DVD's want and the hits are what Collins delivers in this brilliant and memorable performance. The songs are all sung in English. However, with Montreux located in a French canton of Switzerland, Phil's banter with the audience is done with the most elegant of French - at least that's what it sounds like to this southern boy. I don't know a lick of French (pun intended).<br /><br />The short list of Boomerocity favorites on the first disc (excluding, of course, the two drum solos) are:<br /><br />True Colors with its beautiful harmonies, you can feel the camaraderie among Phil and his backup vocalists as they perform this Cindy Lauper hit. I'd have loved to listen in on the rehearsal just on this one song.<br /><br />Probably one of the most beautiful songs ever written, recorded and performed is Separate Lives.  This performance is no exception. With the added vocals of Amy Keys and Arnold McCuller, the song is off the hook!<br /><br />The final performance on the Boomerocity short list of favorites is Easy Lover that was such a huge hit as a duet with Philip Bailey.  The performance is both tight and humorous and was worthy of multiple slaps of the repeat button.<br /><br />The second disc is of a concert held eight years prior on the same stage in Montreux.  The performance is the culmination of Collin's childhood dream to be in a Big Band with the help of his Swiss record company boss and Montreux Jazz Festival honcho, Claude Nobs.  Putting his head together with Quincy Jones and the late Ahmet Ertegun, Collins gave his songs to some of the best arrangers in the business to come up with Big Band versions of the tunes.  A special treat is the performance of the great Tony Bennett of There'll Be Some Changes Made.  Wow! That is one for the history books!<br /><br />Buy Phil Collins Live at Montreux 2004. It brings back lots of memories and is a lot of fun to listen to and watch.<br /><br />Boomerocity.comrformance is the culmination of Collin's childhood dream to be in a Big Band with the help of his Swiss record company boss and Montreux Jazz Festival honcho, Claude Nobs.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|liked the game until the update and then it erased all the games I had unlocked and now I have to start all over. I hope its not like this on every update
0307951529|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, mostly for the fact that it includes stories about real people. It's not just about the author or about theoretical situations. Chris did a great job finding real entrepreneurs for this project, which made it a great read for me. I'd recommending it to anyone that's thinking of starting a business, especially if you're wondering how much it will cost you.
B007VPLNGW|4.0|I enjoy this game and so does my three year old. worth the money. it will give you a laugh.
B00753MBHA|5.0|The more I listen to this cd the better it gets. I must say the guitar playing is phenominal . Wolf really tears it up. The singing is outstanding also. You can understand the lyrics on each song. Rhythm parts are very well arranged and the drummer kicks ass. Baltes always Smokes on Bass ..<br />These guys are over 50 years old and they make better music than all the crappy new bands out there. They make them look silly. Blood of the Nations was a great recording but, I must say<br />I am really liking this one. The songs are very well written . Yeah there are a couple that get tiresome like The Quick and the Dead (Seems like it has been done before) but all in all<br />this is a great recording. Favorite songs include tile track (Stalingrad), Revolution,The Galley ,and my Fav. Twist of Fate. Love the tempo change .<br /> I only hope they can continue to make Excellent Music and I wish them the Best . From a 30 year ACCEPT Fan ..
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Like most of the other reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. Then one day the thing gliched on my kindle fire and set most of the timers to a amazing amount of time (300 hours). I too wish that gameloft would check on these glitches so I can start enjoying it again. :( :( :(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's a phenomenal book. I plan to purchase all the remaining books.  The book is sexy, intense, sensual and erotic.  At age 54, a woman like me needs books like this to get my juices running again.  Actually Ana reminds me of when I was in my early 20's-very naive and innocent.  Christian is fascinating and a man I would never date.  As I read the book I visualize who will play Ana and Christian in a movie.  I can't wait for the movie!  And I hope it's as sexy and erotic as is the book. I have recommended the book to all my friends and they have each purchased a copy.  I highly recommend this book to women!
B0034G4P8A|4.0|This movie was really good, as are all of the latest marvel movies IMO. This movie was very fun to watch in 3D, and the graphics were stunning. The story line is pretty good, and the action was great. There was also a fair amount of comic relief thrown in, which is great for any action movie. If you like superhero movies you'll like this one.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|The gutter-talk is what I love about this show!!!!!!<br /><br />I liked the writing and the characters until, and thought it was a good solid show until the middle of the first episode when Caroline accused Max of crying.  Max staunchly defends herself by claiming she was masturbating.<br /><br />It feels natural and realistic to me.  My girlfriends and I talk like that all the time!  My stoner friends talk about drug use.  And we've had long discussions about the importance of the relationship between a woman and her vibrator.  Hell, I've accused a friend of making a penis when it had been a while for her, and all of the foods she \\"invented\\" were strangely phallic-shaped.<br /><br />I like having a TV show that actually talks about the realities of being poor, single, and female.  You don't have time to be \\"dainty.\\"  When you are around your friends you open up and you are honest like that.<br /><br />Of course it's an exaggeration--it wouldn't be funny if it weren't.  It would just be sad.<br /><br />But because they are willing to \\"Go there,\\" this show won my respect.  It's not for children.  So be it.
0553582038|1.0|This is the worst read in the series thus far.  Characters from the previous books are pushed off stage by an invasion of new characters accompanied by ponderous descriptions of their family tree, their history, their  plots, and their exploits.  Martin says he omitted old characters on purpose because the book was getting too big - yeah right!  I think the editor forgot to strap on Martin's reins and he went trotting down his favorite path - tangents.  Martin brings characters into a scene and then launches a laborious epic about a character's history or relatives.  Good fiction has good pace and the pace in this book is glacial at times.  It's a great book to practice your speed reading as you vault over the parsley searching for the meat.

B007MDB71O|5.0|[EDIT] I saw this twice now... better the second time. If you've read and/or are a fan of the books - then what are you doing reading this?? GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!! If not well then - I suggest you go see it, too.. but don't expect to come away with the same level of excitement as those of us who are full-fledged Barsoomians. You see 'A Princess of Mars' (on which the movie is based) was written over 100 years ago by the genius who penned Tarzan and other great adventures - Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is the inspiration for such great film & television franchises as Star Wars, Star Trek, etc. - and so if you weren't aware of this you might get the impression this is a rip-off of those. It is not. Quite the opposite, in fact. So, please - please: go see this movie and decide for yourself - but first read the book (you can do so for free at Project Gutenberg: [...] or audio book:[...]). Praise: The movie doesn't follow exactly along the lines of APoM but it conveys the story well enough to be both entertaining and thrilling - a truly epic experience in IMAX 3d. The action is thrilling and, during one seen, quite emotional; this is truly like no movie you've ever seen before - one that must be enjoyed on the big screen. Complaints: My complaints do not lie with the actors - who did very well, nor the casting directors - who cast to perfection all of the characters.. or even the director - who was able to properly capture the boyish charm of the novels. My complaint is with Disney: is it really so hard to stick to the book? Why do you have to force Disney-esque 'magic' into a perfectly good narrative causing it to be blocky and somewhat hard to watch for the average non barsoomian viewer?
B004SIP6LS|5.0|This is a must-see film especially if you work or have ever worked in the retail industry! Although a low-budget film, it is packed with hilarious character situations! Jay (Jason Mewes) & Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) are at their best! Dante (Brian O'Halloran) & Randall (Jeff Anderson) are fatasically funny in the everyday scenarios that we can all relate to! They are clerks in a convenient store and a small movie-rental shop, respectively, that constantly get and take abuse from customers. Full of funny wackiness, get this movie now because it's hard to find (except on Amazon, of course)! You'll watch it again and again and love it!
B005WMQ5R8|1.0|After all the great reviews I paid $20 for this movie at Best Buy. What a waste. It's just an over excited bunch of gibberish. I liked Metropolis and Akira. The story of redline is weak and simpleminded.
B002ZCY7SW|1.0|As a huge fan of 24 from the airing of the first episode, I waited with great anticipation every season for the return of Jack Bauer to our television screens.  Yes, 24 had viewers stretching the limits of reality at times, but the overall draw for me was the brokenness and vulnerability Kiefer Sutherland brought to the character of Jack Bauer.  Despite some of the despicable things he was either forced to do or did by choice, Jack was no merciless macho man, but an agent who did what he was ordered to do then paid the consequences on a personal and emotional level.<br /><br />The true essence of the character was never so apparent than those seasons in which Jack was in love with Audrey Raines.  For me, the series began to go downhill in Season 7 with the introduction of the character Renee Walker, who was stiff and unbelievable.  Season 8, which brought back her character, was a slide into awfulness from the first episode on.  The chemistry between Jack and Renee was non-existent and I found myself longing to see Audrey come back from her mental illness and help Jack regain his humanity.<br /><br />The worst part of Season 8, however, was the out-of-control, no-mercy Jack Bauer who supposedly went on a shooting spree over the loss of Renee?  Please.  Audrey I could buy.  Renee I could not.  Some have noted that the spree had to do more with the overall injustice he had experienced throughout his career but it did not come across that way.  Instead, for a man who had lost his wife and daughter (his daughter at least for most of the series), Audrey Raines, and countless friends to go beserk over a character as bland and downright annoying as Renee Walker was too much of a stretch for my imagination.<br /><br />Still, with the horrific ending to an otherwise stellar series (and a phenomenally excellent movie--Redemption), I look forward to the 24 movie in 2013.  Audrey, please come back.  Jack, please come back.  Chloe, please never change from your entertainingly loopy but loveable self.<br /><br />If you have not watched 24, I suggest you view the first six seasons and Redemption, then attempt Season 7.  Season 7 gives us the bittersweet reunion between Jack and his daughter, but by the time we get there so annoyed by the rest of what has happened in the season that we really don't care.  Season 8 is a waste of time and money unless you take to the Renee Walker character in Season 7.  Evidently, many did.  I just don't get it.  One positive thing DID happen in Season 8 - the writers killed off the Walker character so at least we all know that if that 24 movie ever gets off the ground we won't have to put up with Renee.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|101 games. All with terrible controls and cluttered with ads. dont even waste your time on this app. much better games out there

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really liked the book; especially since the heroine only had to kill one person. The love connection needs some work but I digress.  Buy the book!!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am not sure how i missed hearing about this before but all of a sudden every where i lurked i heard about 'wool' - When i read the description in a post written by a reader of apoc fiction (which i love)about it i finally went and bought it. I am so glad i did! Kept me intrigued and entertained. The writing was wonderful, the story and characters flowed. It was post apoc done different.<br /><br />My only regret is that it has ended. Hope for more soon! If you are a post apoc fan this is a must read.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|1) The show itself is possibly the best drama in the history of TV (the Wire is still #1 for me). A perfect marriage of great writing and perfect acting without overacting.<br /><br />2) The show's creators, actors, and writers all participate in the DVD commentaries. There is at least one DVD commentary PER EPISODE and the average is approaching two per. With that level of dedication to producing commentaries just so the fans of the show have an actual incentive to buy the DVDs, it's a wonder that other shows are not following this example. Breaking Bad has done this in a different way through a one hour podcast that follows each episode.<br /><br />3) It allows the fan to judge the season as an actual season rather than as a standalone episode per week. Spend the 11 hours in a marathon enjoying the season and you'll see new things.<br /><br />So for those who bailed out after Episode 2 of Season 5, either a) you were never fans of the show in the first place and you are just trolling or b) you for some reason lack the patience to judge the show as a season which if you got the Season 5 DVD would allow you to do with ease.
0439023521|1.0|I never used the term \\"deus ex machina\\" before, but the expression kept coming to my mind while reading book 1 of The Hunger Games.  Suspension of disbelief is difficult throughout the book, but is especially strained when the author solves her frequent plot problems with sudden miraculous events.<br /><br />It's clearly not an adult book, but I don't know for whom it's appropriate.  Scarlett O'Hara was published when I was 14, and I deeply lived through it several times.  I think that at age 14 I would have enjoyed The Hunger Games, but been angry when I discovered that the author didn't give it an ending.  You might not feel happy with the ending of Scarlett O'Hara, but it did have an ending.<br /><br />I have enjoyed reading many of the one-star reviews already entered here.  I agree with them and will sum up my own feelings by saying that for a few days I enjoyed The Hunger Games a little more than my sudoku puzzles.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|These \\"free\\" entrapment game-apps should be illegal. Customers could easily be liable for unwanted charges. Specially when apps in question are very appealing to preschoolers.<br />Also, on Kindle Fire, forcing the app to go back to your home screen (as recommended by other reviews) does not properly end the application process. It will continue running until you \\"force close\\" under application settings.
0307951529|5.0|I just finished 'The $100 Startup' and I feel that this is one of the stronger books for people that are looking for a push to get started on the path to starting their own business.<br /><br />With a title like 'The $100 Startup' you have a right to be skeptical that this is just another knock off of the ideas that were spread in 'The 4 Hour Workweek.'  While there is a lot of similarity, they are far from being the same thing.<br /><br />The highlights of this book to me were the case studies and the templates.  First, we all know plenty of consultants and Chris's little one page consultant set up sheet is really a wonderful way to put the illusion of needing a huge amount of infrastructure to get started down once and for all.  Second, the business cases were great because they showed the diversity of businesses that have been started using very little start up money and a lot of ingenuity.<br /><br />Finally, I really encourage people to read this book because that every book about starting your own business or creating a new product has one nugget of information in it that makes the money spent on the book well worth it.  So while I thought the diagram on how to choose which product to develop next was worth the time and effort of reading the book, your idea worth paying for might be something entirely different but just as useful.

B006WAIUEK|5.0|As a long time Welsh fan, I suppose I could be considered a little biased - but really, in all honesty, this is one of the cult Scottish author's finest efforts to date.<br /><br />Skagboys revisits the sunny port of Leith and adjoining Edinburgh, and the eclectic cast of characters that made up Welsh's debut effort - the drugged-out classic Trainspotting. All your skeevy old pals are here... ever-acerbic Mark Renton, sweet natured Spud, scheming Sickboy and, naturally, the delightfully psychotic pugilist, Begbie. Only this time, we meet Leith's finest schemies in their early twenties - just as they're developing that nasty little heroin habit which was the focal point of Trainspotting.<br /><br />So yes, it's a prequel to Trainspotting, featuring characters that should be familiar to fans of the earlier book or its cinematic adaptation. But, as always, Welsh is not afraid to delve a little deeper. While on the surface a simple story of a hopeless descent into addiction, the novel also chronicles the sad devolution of the working class in dystopian mid-eighties Scotland.<br /><br />It's quite interesting, but also quite depressing, to bear witness to the slow ravaging of blue collar Scottish society, whose denizens turn to drugs and violence to numb the economic and social hardships incurred by the rise of Maggie's Farm. The novel also deals with the rampant incursion of AIDS into Edinburgh - once Europe's AIDS capital - which spreads all too rapidly through shared needle use and illicit sex.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Trainspotting, or it's excellent sequel Porno (which revisits our anti-heroes in their mid thirties) then I simply can't recommend this read enough. In the off chance you've read some of Welsh's other works, and haven't got around to Trainspotting, then I'd advise you to start here. Be warned, though - as with all the author's works, this is definitely NOT for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Vintage Welsh. It's a good thing.
0307951529|5.0|I was so excited to receive my copy of the $100 Start Up. Even though I have been in business for myself for a number of years, I have had to figure out much of what I do on my own. I have struggled through. My book is dog-eared now for quick reference of all the things I had never thought of but make perfect sense. The stories are inspiring and Mr. Guillebeau makes it so simple that anyone could do this...if they were so inclined. It takes a very special mindset to take the leap and fill a niche. He just makes it simpler for those with that mindset. In the current economy, the release of this book is perfect for graduates. When I graduated college, everyone received \\"What Color Is You Parachute\\" in preparation to go into the corporate world. I hope now everyone received \\"The $100 Start Up\\" in preparation to solve the unanswered questions that mega-corporations are too big, busy, and oblivious to answer. Highly recommend buying more than one copy because you're going to give this away time and time again then wish you had one for yourself!<br />Wendy Reese, [[ASIN:0615425488 The Accidental Yoga Teacher]]
0345803485|5.0|I'm still reading the first book of the trilogy and loving it!  I've recently had surgery and have been out of work for a while this book has def. kept my interest!  If you don't have it already, you should check it out!!

B00812W9QM|4.0|Didn't think Megan's quitting garnered so much screen time. I usually like Megan, but it kind of annoyed me that she got Peggy in trouble by lying. Someone else brought this up, but why is she borrowing lunch money off of Ginsberg ? It should have been explored. This episode was paced way to slow for me. What was up with Pete shagging train dude's crazy wife? ( She reminded me of Glen Close in Fatal Attraction ) Why would Pete go after trouble when life brings enough of its own?<br /><br /> Unlike most of the people and Don I liked Tommorrow Never Knows. It was perfect for the goings on this week in TV Land. Loved Joan's Halloween decor and acting in faux suprise when Don tells her Megan is quitting. I think she is right about Don never marrying a down to earth woman. Which disapointed me and Peggy. Nice to see a certian someone from \\" Saved by the Bell\\" Hilarious having Ginsberg yell \\" Turn it off , its stabbing me in the bleeping heart,\\" when they played the cheesy music that supposed to sound like the Rolling Stones. Also love Elisabeth Moss's facial expressions they are perfect.
B0060AY85C|5.0|I read in a review that \\"Toni never puts language above story.\\" I agree with that statement 100%, and the prioritizing of story is on full display in Home. This is a  short book, but very fertile. How can she pack so much, in so thin a volume. The themes she touches on, each could be a full novel on its' own.<br /><br />Frank Money has returned from the Korean war, with a deep secret. He has covered this secret with mourning the lost of his two best friends, a \\"mourning..so thick it completely covered my shame.\\" Frank and his sister Cee were close growing up, he four years older than her, acted as a big brother should. And his going off to war created a physical separation, but not a division of affection.<br /><br />So, after the war and despite his struggling with post traumatic stress and using alcohol to self heal and exorcise the war demons, when he hears his sister is in danger, he does not hesitate to make his way toward her and.... To say more would give away too much.<br /><br />The use of Frank addressing not only the reader but the author as well was marvelous. This was done, a few times briefly to kind of comment on how the story was unfolding to illustrious effect. The language in this book is simply beautiful, and for some reason it doesn't feel unfinished, as most short novels do. And the ending is brought full circle back to the beginning, all this in under 150 pages. In fact, the reading guide at the end brings up so many good questions you will be astonished as to how one could create that many queries in a short book.<br /><br />Can't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours. This may well be the best novel you read all year. You will be greatly rewarded for taking that time!
B007MJT1K2|2.0|I was excited about a new revamp of an exciting character. New technology that is cutting edge. New way of approaching film.<br />I got a dull, predictable plot that at many points made no effort to connect the story/plot point together.<br />It is as if they were so focuse on the technology that they assumed the story would make itself.<br />You are left with the feeling that the director thought, \\"it's a cartoon so it doesn't need to make sense.\\"<br />And, it didn't.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is pretty good. Well written, it painted a picture in my mind and I was able to clearly visualize every scene. I found that I had a hard time putting it down, and ended up finishing it about eight hours after I started it. It was easy for me to connect with the characters in the novel, and put myself in their shoes.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Kindle version of these books all in one is the very best way to read them. It is a compelling story with strong characters and excellent writing. The visual images are amazing with great detail. It is one story you can really get 'in to'. A very good read.

B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I have a MacBook Pro and switching from my Toshiba, I totally missed just being able to take out my SD card from my camera and insert it into the computer to pull all the images off, clear the card, then return the card to the camera without having to plug in a USB cord to my camera or worry about my camera's battery life.  Newer Macs come with SD card readers as standard, as many purchase one of these, put it into their computer, and forget about it.  I plan to do the same!    The reader is extremely fast!  It recognizes the card almost immediately when I click it in.  Card stays in the reader so none of the card is showing, like some other readers where you have to worry about \\"karate chopping\\" the card while it is inserted.  Very slick packaging, and easy to open bubble back (this is a nice feature nowadays).    My only complaint, is that the website it said to go to in the packaging was wrong.  It then redirected me to the Transcend site in Chinese!  Once I found the flag to change the Country and language, it was cake.  Here is the info:    [...]    Be sure to go to the top left corner to change your country and language for the site.  Then go to Support, Download, Card Readers, RDF1 ExpressCard Reader F1, and it is the only product in part number.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'll be honest- I liked the first book a lot better. This one was good, but some parts dragged along a little and I wasn't as engrossed in it as I was with The Hunger Games.<br />The ending though... That had me reeling, and made me want to read the third book RIGHT NOW! Lol. The end is the only reason I gave this one a 4 star rating. If it weren't for that, it would be a 3.<br />In the end, it was a decent read. I've read much, much worse and paid a lot more for them.
0307951529|5.0|What makes The $100 Startup a must read? Everything.<br /><br />Do you want to be inspired to create the life you want? It's here. Are you looking for examples of other people who have accomplished their dreams and advice on how they did it? It's here. Do you need practical steps and easy-to-implement exercises to keep you on track? Yep, they're in here too.<br /><br />The only thing this book doesn't include in getting started on the path to freedom and security is an actual $100 bill.<br /><br />But then again, if you follow the advice and wisdom of Mr. Guillebeau, you won't let that stop you.
B0072GPQ72|4.0|What does it take to make a grown man cry? Compassion, for one thing, will do it. And Steven Spielberg knows it and knows how to do it. Take for example what is probably Spielberg's least-heralded, yet most moving movie, 1989s \\"Always,\\" which among other thing stands as the final Big Screen appearance of Audrey Hepburn, as a guardian angel no less. Watching it for the umpteenth time on DVD a couple of weeks ago, even knowing the beginning, the ending and the full journey in between, I found it impossible to get through without misting up.<br /><br />Speilberg's lastest effort taking the DVD route home is last year's War Horse. I saw it for the first time a couple of nights ago in its beautifully done Blu-ray edition. And this Vietnam Vet and semi-hardened reporter didn't just mist up. At several points, I was dabbing away actual tears.<br /><br />War Horse, in simple terms, is the story of a thoroughbred named Joey who finds himself serving as a save-the-family-and-its-farm plough horse, then impressed into the  British Army on the eve of World War One as a cavalry officer's mount, his capture by the Germans, rescue of two conscript brothers, and his own rescue in turn by a young French girl and her grandfather for a sort of idyllic breather before heading back to war. The movie's climactic scene is set in a dark and deadly no-man's land between the British and German trenches where Joey triggers an act of compassion by two soldiers who, although enemies, find a common humanity through a horse.  Joey's journey is a string of such encounters, with his life touching humans from farm to war and back full circle.<br /><br />The Blu-ray set of War Horse includes a fascinating assortment of making-of productions, most of them on a separate disc. We get a close look at Spielberg's noted attention to detail, lavished on the film by a set of colleagues he has assembled over the years, among them music-master John Williams and producer Kathleen Kennedy. It was Kennedy who broached the idea of War Horse as a movie to Spielberg after seeing the London production of the play. We see how an officer of the Humane Society helps ensure the safety of the animals who variously play Joey and the rest of the war horses  and include a comedic farm goose. And we see how the inspiring vistas of the British countryside of Dartmoor also double for the fields and villages of France.<br /><br />We also learn how the sound designer created the stunning soundtrack.  Joey's vocalizations include the slowed-down sounds of miniature horses and the teeth-clicking chatter of affection the designer noticed his wife's horse makes whenever she approaches. In one pivotal scene, Joey's confrontation with a tank, a clattering new horse of war, there is no music, only the sounds of the horse and machine.<br /><br />The photography is appropriately spectacular throughout. One panoramic sunset over the Dartmoor countryside brings to mind the vivid burning of Atlanta from Gone With the Wind.<br /><br />In the whole two-hour-plus production, I did find one minor annoyance: the fake battlefield snow flakes toward the end. I kept waiting for somebody to choke on a mouthful of whatever the puffy plastic-looking flakes were. Instead of falling naturally toward the ground, they swirled sideways and upward. Why can't somebody come up with something that if not real snow, at least looks it. (See White Christmas, 1954)<br /><br />Much more real: the rest of War Horse, particularly its compassion.
0345803485|1.0|This uproar over this book is truly much ado about nothing. In fact, this is the worst book and biggest waste of money for me this year. A meager plot line, one dimensional characters and repetitive sex scenes grow stale and predictable at about 25% of the way through; by the half way point you may - like me - just skip to end. Like any formula romance, sitcom or soap, there isn't much substance or depth here. The BDSM titillates but does not compensate for everything else that is lacking.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Oh Mockingjay, why must you be like this?<br />I think this is much better than the second book in the trilogy, but not as good as the first. Parts of it are really cheesy or kind of boring.<br />Not enough love triangle stuff. Peeta wasn't in much of it, and while I understand, it bothered me. I'm a romantic. I need more than what there was lol.<br />And the ending.. I can't say much about that because I hate spoiler-type reviews, but it was eh.
1609613937|5.0|Want to lose a few pounds in a couple weeks?<br />Read a diet book, ANY diet book.<br />Want to become healthy, lose weight and feel great for life?<br />Read The Starch Solution.<br /><br />When a friend or patient asks \\"where do I begin\\" This book will be at the top of my recommended reading list. I will tell them to begin their journey with The Starch Solution.<br /><br />On a chance mountain bike ride, I met a physician that said he could only cure one condition, bacterial infections. The diseases that are so common to our world are only managed. However, he shared, that through nutritional counseling, he is beginning to help people heal themselves.<br /><br />Rather than preach throughout our ride, he said, \\"Watch Forks over Knives and read The China Study.\\"<br /><br />I began there. Then I discovered Dr. McDougall and his wife, Mary. Soon the value of the words I was digesting became crystal clear. My mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer and patients, friends and family began sharing recent medical afflictions. In the four months that I have been on my journey, I have seen one friend die of bladder cancer, another has grade 4 pancreatic cancer.<br /><br />I am committed to a Starch Solution lifestyle.My cholesterol has dropped 60 points, BMI is 24 and I feel great. The hills I climb on my bike seem shorter. This month I turn 55 and I am loving life.<br /><br />I believe The Starch Solution is the book Dr. McDougall has always wanted to write. He pulls no punches, is direct, and presents a plain and simple argument for making changes that will promote health. He challenges you but includes enough footnotes and quoted research to satisfy the skeptics, providing ammunition for those scientifically inclined. The personal tales of the \\"Stars\\" will make it real for those that want to let their heart guide them to an answer.<br /><br />Rather than skirting the issue by saying we should eat a \\"plant strong,\\" or \\"whole foods\\" diet that has a \\"Spectrum\\" of choices,this book is clear when it states:<br /><br />\\"The diet that best prevents disease, best supports the body's innate healing mechanisms, and best promotes sustained weight loss is a low-fat diet based on starches, with added vegetables and fruits, and with no animal products or free oils.<br /><br />A giant step toward health and spontaneous healing is yours for the taking.\\"<br /><br />Thank you Dr. John and Mary.

0345803485|1.0|I respectfully finished the first book in the trilogy because it was chosen for my book club. I've threatened to quit the club if I'm asked to read all three.<br />The \\"story\\" seems to have been written by a 15 year old girl and is utterly atrocious. It lacks depth, emotion, and pizzaz. Our hero Billionaire..not millionaire Christian Grey (has grey eyes?? ) who has amassed a size able fortune by the age of 27 is sexy, strong, tall, an accomplished pilot, pianist, and stalker with a hunger for painful sex. Anastasia the protagonist IS Bella Swan. Clumsy and forgettable she's annoying and for the life of me I can't fathom what Christian sees in her!  Her character is a walking contradiction being both snarky/wiseass and naive virgin who comes at the sound of her own name.. Really?!? The sex scenes start out as bearable but quickly become repetitive and then comical. I started skimming through them after I was 80% through. It moved slow, had no side stories. They sat around and talked by email....(What the hell?! I can't think if anything more boring that reading a book laid out in email form?!)<br />Here are a list if my annoyances.<br />How many times Christian says Anastasia!!!<br />Biting of her lower lip<br />How he smells of expensive body wash<br />He pulled my ponytai<br />I ran my fingers through his hair<br />He gasped<br />She tripped<br />She blushed<br />My inner goddess<br />Jeez<br />He touched my sex<br />He touched me down there<br />And the ever popular.... Holy Crap!<br /><br />If you take these out of the story would be 10 pages long! It made me want to rip my hair out! I forced myself to finish and I can't fathom how this has been dragged out to 3 books.<br /><br />With all that being said my husband is getting laid more and im going to look into the Anne Rice series The Sleeping Beauty.
0307951529|5.0|If you've ever dreamt of leaving your current job to strike out on your own, but are not quite sure how to begin making this dream a reality, the $100 Startup is for you. Chris Guillebeau artfully blends inspiration and solid advice together to give you the push you need to get started.<br /><br />I've been a long-time follower of Chris's non-conformity movement, and this book is the epitome of why I'm such a big fan. Every chapter tells the story of people from all walks of life who have started their businesses with very little and their primary income now comes from those business.<br /><br />A recap at the end of the chapters, along with incredibly useful tips and tools sprinkled throughout, create the perfect combination of showing readers how getting a business started can be done, and how so many people just like you and me have successfully done it.<br /><br />It's not a get-rich-quick scheme type of book, so if you're looking for a way to make money fast, this is not the book to read. If you're looking to get inspired by the stories of people who, with hard work and action, have made working for themselves a reality, and want some real advice on how you can get there too, then I would say pick this book up immediately and get started on your startup.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|great game...just need to allow the friend requests to go through and the game restarts everytime I try to visit other villages
0307951529|5.0|This well-planned book is filled with all the information needed to start a business based on one's own passions in order to start living the life one truly desires. The author not only gives all the basics of how to do it, but he also intertwines so many examples of others who have successfully 'reinvented' their own way to make a living that while I continued to read further, I became motivated and the ideas started to come to the surface and inspire me to move forward. With our changing world, this book makes so much sense and, if anything, will encourage more people to take that leap forward instead of putting it off and really exploring one's ultimate aspirations to a better life and better world.<br /><br />The title of the book doesn't necessarily mean that every business can be created on $100 but that it is possible to do so. This book has really motivated me to get creative in finding a purposeful and meaningful life that goes beyond just earning a living but will also help inspire me to do something that will make a difference by helping others along the way. Excellent read! I highly recommend this book to anyone who is thinking of making a change in the way they earn a living. This author is honest and has great advice to give to us all, as he's traveled the world learning life's lessons, doing what he loves and finding a way to give back, as well. Highly recommend this one!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is what a dictionary should be: easy to use and always at hand, especially if you download rather than using it on-line. In addition to definitions, it always provides synonyms. Very helpful when writing. I bought it at The Amazon App Store for my Kindle Fire after trying out 2 or 3 other dictionaries. This one from Farlex works best and is easiest on the eyes.
0307951529|5.0|Chris has written an excellent introduction to running your own business here, and particularly in the lean, innovative way that so many people are doing it in the 21st century. While Chris himself sells books and info products, I really appreciated the diversity of businesses that he profiled in the book.<br /><br />New and aspiring business owners will get discover a whole new philosophy of work that's uniquely suited for the internet era, and skills to help them make a living from dreams they might have given up on. In a time when technology and the recession are redefining the shape of the traditional job, this book offers a detailed profile of the new toolbox necessary to meet your goals.<br /><br />People already in business, though, will be impressed by the ingenuity of many of the people profiled in the book. Anyone who reads the book will come away with clever ideas that they can implement to make their own work easier, cheaper, and more fun.
B007EC6FIS|4.0|As a long-time listener and fan of Keane (I bought Hopes & Fears only because Best Buy was offering the CD for cheap as a way to promote a \\"great new band\\" not long after it was released) I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Other reviewers have seemed to indicate that this is some major departure from previous highs and styles. Sure, the Night Train EP was pretty bad and Perfect Symmetry was a bit of a new sound (but not too different) but in the end this all sounds like not only the same band but one who is allowing their music to evolve (but not very much) over time.  The sound of this album fits in with pretty much everything that they've ever done before. I can't say that all of these tracks will go into my list of tracks for shuffling but nearly all of them are something I will listen to again as part of my personal music rotation.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: if you like Keane this album is not likely to disappoint; in fact, you'll probably really like it.
B00466HN6S|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my granddaughter's birthday.  I had a very short time frame to get it purchased, shipped to me, get it wrapped and then shipped on to her!  The seller was able to comply with my request of shipping it ASAP.  I received the DVD with days to spare, so that I could get it to my granddaughter that is hundreds of miles away.  That is a true business person!
B007M6P01O|5.0|This was definitely the most exhilarating and intense episode of the season but it was the finale so what would you expect?  I thought the entire season was orchestrated magnificently.  I find it hard to believe the people who considered much of the season a bore.  Killing zombies and running can only get you so far.  The buildup with Shane and Rick was incredible.  Even though I hated Shane I found his character to be the most dynamic and interesting of the group.  It does not mean I didn't want to see him dead though.<br /><br />The slack Rick took from his wife after his confession about Shane was utterly ridiculous.  Lori practically whispered it into Rick's head that Shane was dangerous and had to die in a previous episode!  Now I think that she would rather of had Rick die instead of Shane.  Honestly, I think her character should have been killed off instead of Shane.  It would have been nice to seen how her death would have impacted Shane and his relationship with the rest of the group.<br /><br />The fact that most of the party disagreed with Rick's decision to keep the infection a secret was completely ludicrous.  Particularly Hershel's family.  How they responded after Shane forced the barn door open, and accepting the fact that the zombie infection couldn't be cured just doesn't explain why they would accept the truth about the \\"plague\\" being inside of everyone.  On top of the fact that there was hardly any evidence whatsoever prior to Shane's resurrection  .
B00425S1H8|5.0|I was looking for a USB to Serial adapter so I could use my Garmin GPS with Microsoft Streets and Trips.<br />My requirements:<br />Windows 7 64bit compatible: yes, and installs with included disk.<br />DB9 Male serial connector: yes<br />Connects to laptop via USB, but appears as a serial port to any software. Yes.<br />Appears to be of decent quality, at a reasonable price. Easy to install and use.<br /><br />My installation process: installed driver by right clicking on setup, selecting \\"start as administrator\\" (usually necessary for Win 7). After driver installation plugged in the adapter and went to control panel->hardware devices, found the adapter. Clicked on it to modify settings to 4800 bps. Started Streets and Trips, clicked on \\"configure gps,\\" didn't work. Set GPS to NMEA mode instead of Garmin mode, and it worked. The software put a big red circle around my backyard, which means it was reading the GPS, and the adapter was functioning as it should.

0143120530|3.0|The subtitle of the book, The Art and Science of Remembering Everything, is misleading.  It would be better titled:  One Man's Journey to Better Understand Memory.  There is little significant art or science discussed in the book.  I have not read many mnemonic technique books, but I imagine if you are searching for a memory tool book there are better texts available.  This is more of a romp through Memory Lane of mnemonics.

1402786360|5.0|There are a LOT of dessert cookbooks out there, but every now and then one comes along (I'm looking at you SprinkleBakes the book!) that is so incredibly original and beautiful that you owe it to yourself and everyone you love who loves sweets to get a copy for yourself. And a few for those sweet-loving people you love, too!<br /><br />Heather's blog is well-known site of arty, whimsical confections, but it is also an awe-inspiring epicenter of serious craft--and her debut book is no different. It is filled with gorgeous, eye-popping creations that would thrill any kid (including the one inside you right now, craving a cookie!) and it is all underpinned by a serious philosophy: As adults, the only creative time most of us get any more is in the kitchen, specifically when we make dessert; knowing that, let's make the most of it! This book takes you step-by-step through the dessert artist's journey, from the blank canvas to painting technique to sculpture 101 to the high-concept work of art--only this is all edible art!<br /><br />And in case there are any doubts about being able to actually pull off these creations, have no fear: Heather's how-to photographs and clear instructions make it all a snap. Plus, half the book is must-have basic recipes for everything from sugar cookies to tart pastry. I have made four of the recipes in the book so far (including the Blue Velvet Cupcakes) and can honestly say they are DELICIOUS as well as beautiful. On two separate occasions, my dinner guests said the chocolate cake was the best they ever had in their lives. That's right: Best. Ever.<br /><br />I'm already practicing my fondant skills so I can serve up her epic rendition of the Yule log: that crazy Dura-Flame-based bit of genius is SO going on my holiday table!

0307592731|1.0|I'll admit it right off the bat, I'm not sure this genre is my cup of tea. I didn't like \\"Three Cups of Tea,\\" I abhorred \\"Eat, Love, Pray\\" and I didn't like \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" one bit. Having said this, I saw that most other reviewers described this book as \\"gripping,\\" \\"compelling,\\" and \\"heartbreaking\\" and I hoped that I would feel the same way when I finished reading \\"Wild.\\" But, after forging my way through a couple hundred pages, I can only describe this book as monotonous, tedious and emotionally unsatisfying.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book. I wanted to love this author. I wanted to walk beside this woman on her journey of self-discovery and live the emotions she lived, and feel the transformation she was bound to undergo. I wanted to feel her boots on my feet, taste her fears in my mouth, and nod in understanding at each new revelation that came her way. What I found is that I couldn't keep focussed on the story for more than a paragraph at a time. I read, then skimmed, read, then skimmed, hoping to find the well-crafted story I had read so much about.<br /><br />Instead, this book read like a never ending whine fest. If I had to read about the chafing on Ms. Strayed's hips from her overloaded back pack just one more time, I think I would have thrown my iPad out the window. There seemed to be no real arc to the storyline, just one frustrating ordeal after another. If any character transformation occurred, it must have occurred in the last few pages of the book, a long way past where I stopped reading. It is true that Ms. Strayed talked openly and honestly about graphic details of her life, but that didn't connect me to her character in any meaningful way, and without this connection, I didn't care enough about this woman to read on. I trudged and I trudged and I trudged right along beside the author as far as I could go, but eventually I was compelled to toss my metaphorical boots over the edge of a cliff and bring my journey through the pages ofWild to a premature end.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I was enthralled by the wonderful plot, the highly engrossing characters. I wished to see the second season, and will purchase it as soon as it's available. This has been an exciting series, and I look forward to the second season with stimulated anticipation.<br />B. Thomas Lewis
B007HJ8RTI|1.0|The first episode was impressive in a graphic, fleshy way, and the story seemed initially interesting. Then I saw the second episode which is loaded with very cliche, predictable, cheesy sentimental garbage. Example: a wolf kills an aggressor to protect a woman and her boy, and then the wolf cuddles up with a sick kid in bed awwwwwwhhh.....cute, violence and then back to cuddly stuff. There is actually nothing good about the script except that unfortunately there is a market for this.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|All of my friends were begging me to read The Hunger Games, so I bought the book and exitedly started reading. I was expecting an amazing book, I was actually pretty exited. I read through the parts where Katniss volunteers for her sister, gets a makeover, thinking &#34;Well this is nice but when do the hunger games start?&#34; Then they did, and I began shaking uncontrolably and felt like vomiting. The reason for this was not the violence, really there wasnt a lot. It was the way the violence was executed. A crippled boy is stabbed in the back trying desperetaly to run. One of the main charecters kills a defensless girl trying to stay warm. And shure it all was a little disturbing but it wasnt the reason I threw this book across the room in anger. It was the fact that the so called heroine did nothing heroic. She ran off into the woods, and diddnt come back until there was only like, two people left to kill. And SHE wasnt even the person to do it. I wasnt expecting her to kill, I expectd dear heroic Katniss to defend the defenseless, rise against the capitol and refuse to fight. If the kids diddnt want to fight then there was nothin the big bads could do and the worst book series in the world could have ended in book one. Katniss was never a true hero. I am being teased and made fun of simply for not liking these books. All I have left to say is this: Why are kids entertained by other kids being forced to kill each other? Why are The Hunger Games so huge when theyre not even written well? There is no hope, no love, no peace. And isnt that supposed to be the moral of The Hunger Games? If we dont clean up our act now we could end up like this! I diddnt see that moral at all in the book. If you want to call me sensitive for not enjoying kids killing each other, go right ahead. But its not sensetivity, its humanity.

0307951529|5.0|Sometimes the most important thing to stirring you to action is realizing that you're not alone, and that many, many people have done this before you. Chris systematically breaks down the psychological, financial, and structural barriers (perceived or real) that often get in the way of people taking an idea from concept to reality.<br /><br />Some of the key points he makes:<br /><br />* You already have everything you need. Your skill sets, NOW, are what you can use to make a business. (It's not about obtaining another degree, or more skills, or more money -- you can get started).<br /><br />* It's not enough to have passion. Your passions have to intersect with the creation of a product that is also useful and valuable to someone else. The good news is that you can find that.<br /><br />* Even location independent workers still work. The myth of the permanent vacation is construed. You have to do the work.<br /><br />* Having one job in an uncertain economy may be a much riskier endeavor than having multiple streams of income or running your own business. In today's economy, diversifying your work may be the key to success.<br /><br />* At the same time, you don't have to quit your day job. It's not about the drama and the glitz of walking away in a huff; it's about making what you have work, and hustling on the side if you have to. Case after case shows us people making it happen.<br /><br />The most useful part of the book (for me) was the detailed break-down of several critical processes in business creation. The \\"decision-making matrix\\" detailed how to evaluate projects and figure out which ones were worth doing; and while it seems simple, it was a life-changer for me because I have difficulty making decisions. The \\"product launch checklist\\" and \\"one page business plan\\" both gave me something concrete and actionable that I could use, today, to start writing my own plans.<br /><br />It seems so simple on paper, but that's the genius behind Chris' work: he takesthese big, scary, often ovewhelming processes and gives a step-by-step blueprint that shows you what's possible and makes it seem do-able through case studies, mapping and analysis. And that's the point: you can do it, and you can get started right away.

0307949486|4.0|I realize that I'm jumping on the \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" bandwagon rather late. To be honest, I resisted reading this book for a long time, because I'm a snob and I tend to distrust popular trends. But I finally picked up \\"Tattoo\\" at an airport bookstore (where it was by far the least offensive thing on display), and I'm glad that I did, because this is a pretty awesome book. Not a classic or anything, but a fun read.<br /><br />What really surprised me about Larsson's book is that it's light on action, and heavy on exposition and atmosphere -- which is fine by me. The central figure in the plot, Mikael Blomkvist (the girl with the tattoo is really the secondary protagonist), is an investigative journalist whose hobbies include exposing shady corporate figures and sleeping around a lot. Most of the book consists of Blomkvist investigating the decades-old disapperance of a woman from a wealthy family, so page after page is dedicated to him interviewing various witnesses/suspects and combing through newspaper archives. If this all sounds boring to you, you'll probably find the book itself boring; but I generally enjoyed following Blomkvist's investigation, and I thought the character himself had a charming low-key appeal.<br /><br />Another surprising aspect of the book is its political content. Larsson wears his (left-wing, by U.S. standards) politics on his sleeve, and uses the book as a soapbox for condemning corporate corruption and calling attention to various forms of violence and abuse against women. (The book's original Swedish title, \\"Men Who Hate Women,\\" was perhaps more appropriate, though obviously unsuited for the not-very-adventurous U.S. market.) More conservative readers will probably be annoyed by the book's politics, and I suppose even liberal readers might find the political content intrusive; I didn't mind it, because I tended to agree with Larsson's points and I like social commentary, even when it's in-your-face.<br /><br />That said, I did have some major problems with the book. The prose style, at least in translation, is rather plain and uninspiring. (Raymond Chandler, this ain't.) The beginning of the book is too slow, and the ending drags on too long after the major mystery has been solved. Also, I wasn't keen on the solution to the mystery; the revelation of the \\"bad guy\\" somehow didn't have much impact for me. Still, a lot of mysteries are disappointing in this regard ... the chase is almost always more satisfying than the capture.<br /><br />In the end, I'd recommend \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" to the other skeptics out there. The book isn't quite as good as you've heard -- Lisbeth Salander in particular is nowhere near as \\"original\\" a character as people claim she is -- but it is pretty cool.

B007DIQC90|5.0|Don't miss this group, of whom I know very little, having just heard them for the first time today. I didn't even bother to wait - this is a CD I wanted now. That doesn't happen very often for me, and admittedly I have eclectic taste, but I am simply stunned with OM&M, their vivacity, freshness, their very obvious difference. Excellent vocals as their voices are not typical or routine nor even \\"similar to so and so,\\" and that is so to their credit. They aren't trying to be anyone else, anything already worn down to a nub from over-familiarity.<br /><br />Initially it was their curious type of musicality that gripped me, I will listen to anything, once, but if you manage to \\"sound\\" different that will get a second listen. I have spent all day unpacking this sound; they do have their musical quirks, which can be described as bouncy, effervescent, soaring, energetic, even jaunty, like swathes of shimmering silk banners, and then, it all pales and almost shivers with melancholy. Add in her breathy voice, possibly the most interesting, original vocalizing since the lead singer for the Cranberries and the drifting, weaving, tickling layers of sound around her voice and it is enough to make you just stop and HEAR, with that wonderful, priceless sensation as if for the first time.<br /><br />In time I will put it all together, words, images, interplay between their complementary vocalists, male and female, but for now, and I hope a long time, I just don't want to lose that shock of something so unexpected that it makes you happy.<br /><br />There is not a poor or sloppy or wasted track, the whole CD, whether played in shuffle or in order, works; nothing whiny, cloying, tedious or intentionally fatuous in their efforts, what an amazing body of sound here. Like the best of Modest Mouse (a sound in perpetual confusion as to what it is, which I rather like, and is only one indie example) OM&M delivers, but with more consistency.<br /><br />Do something great for yourself today, GET this CD, and maybe it will be Mountain Sound, or Dirty Paws, or Lake House, but it will be one of them that makes you just stop and think, omg, to HEAR is such a delight, and they make you feel it too, not just hear it, but feel it.

It is poorly written, imitates Jackie Collins, not that I think Jackie is any great shakes herself but at least she is somewhat original.  I just don't understand the popularity of this series.  It's worthless and a waste of paper.  Maybe the only reason people want to read it is because it has been so controversial.
B005F6NA56|4.0|I held off buying this album for awhile as I've frequently been burned (bored) with follow up attempts once someone breaks through to popularity.I wish now I hadn't waited. This is my favorite piece of music in the past 6 months. My tastes are peculiar, so I won't spend a lot of time telling you why I like it so much, but suffice it to say that Leslie has happily decided to go her own way, and evolve out of her (very pleasant)pop persona of past and into a more mature, and daring musician of the here and now. I love it. You might, you might not. You won't know till you try it.
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|Don't get me wrong. This is definately a good movie that has its many moments. The use of Gina Carano in this film was brilliance. She's a good actress and a phenomenal fighter. Not to mention, she's a phenomenal fight/actor as well. In fact, \\"HAYWIRE\\" has tremendous action scenes and tremendous fight scenes. The movie as a whole though, has many problems.<br /><br />Carano, rooted in Mixed Martial arts, is new to acting, but this movie alone proves that she has a career in it. She holds her own and she is far from the problem with this film. She is exactly what she is supposed to be in this film, a top secret operative named Mallory Kane who lives for the job and is such a force to be reconed with that even the men in her business don't want to mess with her. Many of her scenes are just plain action movie eye candy, and I'm not talking about her beauty. There is a fight in a hotel room, a scene where she is fleeing from heavily armed police men and a scene where she is pinned down on a snowy road in the middle of the woods and many more.<br /><br />These are all great scenes, but the movie as a whole just doesn't have any meat to it. When a movie can be explained by simply calling it a \\"revenge flick\\". It's too simple. Especially these days. That's what it is. No more needs to be said. It isn't enough to have a bunch of cool action scenes thrown together for the purpose of serving one objective. Audiences are too smart these days and the actors in this film (McGregor, Douglas, Banderas, Fassbender, Carano & 'yes' even Tatum) are better than this.<br /><br />After watching Carano participate in many hand to hand fight scenes to go through her objective, which were all cool, It began to get tiresome. We know that Carano can fight and fight/act, but on one of her \\"revenge\\" scenes, instead of taking care of something quickly and steathly, we have to endure another unnecessary fist fight. As good as she is 'supposed to be', I would think a long unnecessary exchange of fists would be frowned upon if unavoidable. This, to me, is a perfect example of the lack of creativity from the filmmakers and Soderbergh.<br /><br />A cool movie that will fall into the forgettable pile by no fault of the actors involved or the fight choreographers.ists would be frowned upon if unavoidable.

0525423281|5.0|What can I say... Stephanie Perkins is my new favorite author. I could read her books over and over and over - get to the end and flip back to the beginning to read it again. I loved Anna and the French Kiss and was delightfully surprised to find Anna and St Clair in Lola and the Boy Next Door.<br /><br />I love Lola! I love her costumes, her tenacity, her indecisiveness even when she knows what the right thing is to do. I love everything about her. And I loved going on her journey with her. She's a strong, well rounded character, one I would love to sit and chat with (while possibly helping her to design awesome outfits).<br /><br />OK, I love everything about this book. I love the story, the characters, the heartbreak, the struggles, the laughter. Oh yes, I laughed. Cricket is way too gangly not to laugh at him sometimes. But he's also brilliant. I love the relationship between him and his twin, Calliope. Heck, by the end I even liked Calliope. The only one I was never thrilled with was Lola's boyfriend, Max.<br /><br />Back to the review... the writing was fabulous, the story was amazing and once again, Stephanie Perkins gives us a novel for anyone of any age to enjoy! (well, almost every age... there is a tiny bit of swearing and a little sex and kissing) ;-)
0307951529|5.0|I've been reading Chris's blog for a few years now and I've bought several of his products. What's consistent about Chris's projects is the quality and usability. In The $100 Startup, he has done it again. Stories of the many people who have started microbusinesses are inspiring, certainly, but the great worth of this book is in the specific, actionable steps, charts, and worksheets that guide you on your way to your own microbusiness.<br /><br />If you have no interest in creating a second income stream or in striking out on your own to build something that matters to you, this book won't be a good fit. But, if you've dreamed of doing more, but were afraid of the cost or weren't really sure how to get started, this book has the tips to get you there. Not only that, but Chris is credible -- he's done himself what he's outlined in this book. So have lots and lots of other people, people you'll meet in this book. It may be the best $14 you could spend.

But Poggio did not succumb to it, though he had every reason to do so.\\"<br /><br />I stopped when I read that. This book, which illuminates ancient and middle ages and how the ancient writings were kept alive to be found one day, is a great book. We get so caught up in modern times, modern history, that we forget that history has roots, and the times and the lives of the present are rooted in the times and events of the past.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I hope you do too.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|\\"The Avengers\\" has been a movie in the works for a long time, merging four superhero movies into one. First of all, you have Robert Downey Jr. who brought Iron Man to life with two films, the second had some major scripting problems in my opinion. Then you have Chris Evans reprising his role as Captain America, a movie that had its moments, but was plagued with too many montages in the middle of the movie and a villain that was never fleshed out. Mark Ruffalo stepped in to play the Hulk and Chris Hemsworth (Cabin in the Woods, Snow White and the Huntsmen) returns as Thor, after his movie was much better than many expected.<br /><br />I love the big blockbuster movie just like anybody else, but over the past few years, I've been extremely disappointed with many of the offerings. Most of that was because too many directors (Bay, Wiseman & Anderson) and studios treat their audiences as if they only want explosions and gunfire to be satisfied with their purchase of a movie ticket. Many of the sequels, like \\"Iron Man 2\\" seemed to misplace all the money they made from the first \\"Iron Man\\" movie and gave us little to no action, more specifically a scene in the beginning and a grand finale. Finally, many of the superhero movies included too many characters instead of fleshing out just one and writing a good script. Three of the four original \\"Batman\\" series are included in this along with \\"Spiderman 3\\", which was just awful.<br /><br />Keeping that in mind, \\"The Avengers\\" on the surface, looks like it could quite possibly meet all of the above criteria for a bad superhero movie, but that just isn't the case. The trailer is a collage of special effects and explosive action. The movie is full of characters like the ones I listed above as well as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury and two other superheroes who didn't get their own movie, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Yet, much credit needs to be given to writer/director Joss Whedon (Cabin in the Woods, Buffy the Vampire Slayer) who managed to keep a lot of things in check and despite never being handed anything this big, delivered a spectacular superhero movie and the best movie so far this year.<br /><br />The movie certainly isn't perfect. I've wished for a long time that superhero movies could deliver an emotion connection like Christopher Nolan's \\"Dark Knight\\" did in 2008, but that movie continues to be the exception. Although what you did get is time at the movie theatre well worth your money. The script is well written and the action isn't sparse. The movie is frequently funny and surprising. There are times in the middle of the film that are very slow but it all comes together with well-timed events and an ending that is exactly what you expect from a band of superheroes that includes the Hulk, defending the earth from destruction.s, Buffy the Vampire Slayer) who managed to keep a lot of things in check and despite never being handed anything this big, delivered a spectacular superhero movie and the best movie so far this year.<br /><br />The movie certainly isn't perfect.

0439023513|2.0|Ugh!  So disappointed!! =[  The only good part that I liked about this book was who she ends up with in the end. I do know that all stories cannot have everyone live, but jeez.  It seems like everyone I liked in this book died! It just wasn't fair.  Then at the end it's hard to tell what was real and not.  You do eventually, but while you're reading it it gets very confusing.  I was annoyed at the fact of how stupid Katniss became and could not decide basic things.  I guess I just wanted that happy ending, which I do know that all the stuff she went thru would make anyone go a little off the deep end but yeah, majorly disappointed..... =[
B003OA6AOI|1.0|This is a review of just the Cyberwoman episode.  I wish I could wipe this episode from my memory.  I really like scifi and powered my way through five seasons of Primeval without a second thought about the usefulness of the time I spent on it but this episode made me feel silly for watching.  The previous reviewers aren't lying, the acting is bad in this one (except the Japanese guy, so the guest actor with the fewest lines did well at least).<br /><br />Some positives: To be fair, they did a really nice job on the fake body with all the metal stuck through it.  Aces to the prop team, and even though Lisa's metal suit design would look at home on the set of Power Rangers (or Xena) it was at least really well built.  Oh, and the actor who plays Jack was good at acting like he was being electrocuted.  That's all the positives I've got.<br /><br />So yeah, skip this one.  At least now I can get some sleep instead of getting hooked into watching another episode.
B007SGM084|3.0|After reading the reviews, I have decided not to purchase the Trilogy until the pricing comes down for the Kindle download.  I have heard alot about the books and was going to take a shot at reading them but until the rush ends with these like all other books do in time, then I will wait for the clearance section to download them.  The publishers are price gorging this right now thats for sure!  Amazon should rethink the pricing on this for the download that doesn't cost them much at all to do! Bringing the price down will certainly help sell the downloads!
B005LAIHEA|4.0|\\"The Five-Year Engagement\\" is at first, not what I expected, at least in its entirety. While it is very funny, it is nowhere near the comedy movie that you would expect from Jason Segel (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Bad Teacher, Knocked Up) who wrote, starred and produced this movie, or Judd Apatow who produced \\"Engagement\\" as well as \\"Bridesmaids\\", \\"Step Brothers\\" & \\"Pineapple Express\\", among others. You can definitely see the similarities in style between \\"Bridesmaids\\" and \\"Engagement\\".<br /><br />Emily Blunt has made a career off of dramatic roles in movies like \\"Charlie Wilson's War\\", \\"The Young Victoria\\" & \\"The Wolfman\\". So I was anxious to see her finally do something where she could be funny and less dramatic on screen. I had seen her in a little movie called \\"Wild Target\\" a few months back and she was hilarious and as the brits would say, `charming', in the film. I was hoping for that and more, but got a bit less than I was expecting.<br /><br />Blunt plays Violet Barnes and Segel plays Tom Solomon, two people with their whole lives ahead of them that meet at a New Year's Eve Party dressed as a giant pink super bunny and Princess Diana. Their chemistry is natural in the film. In fact, what \\"Engagement\\" does right is be funny, entertaining and quirky, all the while being very real, as far as relationships go. That is the draw of the film. Relationships aren't always glorious, shiny and silhouetted by marvelous sunsets, like portrayed in the movies. They are dirty and at times sad. They are complicated. There is give and take and sometimes the give and the take changes who you are.<br /><br />I do recommend \\"The Five-Year Engagement\\" but I do this by making sure you know that you aren't going to get \\"Bridesmaids\\" or \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\". The movie is unique in its own right. It is as unique as the characters in the film. The movie may be a little long, but in that time, you will grow close to the people in the film and you will relate to them and see yourselves at many times. \\"Engagement\\" is more of a commentary on life and choices than a burst out comedy. Emily Blunt and Jason Segel did a splendid job in a film that may disappoint some, but others will find to be endearing and something that could be watched many times.selves at many times. \\"Engagement\\" is more of a commentary on life and choices than a burst out comedy.

1469984202|5.0|It' rare to discover an author in the scifi genre that you can love to love. Hugh certainly fits the bill. WOOL grabs you from the beginning and compels you through the story. Masterfully crafted, this one is destined to be a classic. The characters are deep and relatable. If they don't speak to you, you may not be human.<br /><br />Free of formula spaceships, aliens and dragons, Hugh paints a gritty and real picture of what our future may hold. Believe me, all these five star ratings are well justified, as I type a review at 3am....<br /><br />Read it. Savor it. Appreciate it.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|Late one night while my wife was asleep I was jsut flipping through netflix looking for something I might like that she might now.  Saw \\"Troll Hunter\\".  Netflix ratings had it at 4 stars for me.  I had been hunting for a while so decided to give it a chance.  I'm glad I did.  It's wasn't the b-grade movie I expected.  The cinematography was beatiful.  The actors were not bad at all.  The story was very interesting.  I was fairly riveted the whole show.  It's one of the few movies I'd watch again.
B0061S073A|5.0|This is a great app. My kids ages 4 & 6 dealt enjoy it as well.I don't t have to worry about them viewing any unwanted sites.
1433530848|5.0|If you are already a fan of the extraordinary ESV Study Bible or if you're getting giddy about your first purchase--get this one. Unbelievable how they crammed all the beautiful notes and maps and diagrams and charts into a small enough size to carry easily in a big without needing a magnifying glass. Absolutely gorgeous & portable.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|I purchased this album and trust me I am a big fan of Megadeth.  After saying that I am disapointed in this record for two reasons.  The songs do not sound as thought out as his past albums and there are two songs that are old ones that were not really good songs to begin with and were better as demos or b-sides.  The last album was almost legandary with only a few weak spots.  This one here seems that you must listen to the songs carefully to find the cool stuff and then it still lets you down, maybe it will grow on me after time but my first impressions were not good.<br /><br />Its still better that Cryptic/Risk garbage by a long shot.  Dave, you been tearing things apart for 11 years now destroying pussy bands, do not change course now!
B007NZDES0|5.0|Like everyone else here, I saw THE goddess, Sade. I saw her opening night of her North American tour in Baltimore and saw her again in Norfolk. I wish she was here again and I'd go see her tonight. This is by far one of my top concerts of all time...right up there with Michael Jackson and the genius himself, Stevie Wonder. The visual effects, Sade's voice, the oh so tight band made this one night I will never forget. It was only heightened by the fact that I got to see the concert with one of my best friends, my brother. No offense to anyone who has or will post here, but he has got to be the top Sade fan of all time. I never knew he bought her CDs and would drive from D.C. to Alabama to college and play the same Sade CD over and over again. The night of the concert, he stared at the stage and couldn't move. He was finally seeing her live. Thank you Sade and band for one of the best nights of my life. I cannot WAIT for this CD to come out!
0062209493|5.0|This CD book is absolutely great !! The story of Chris Kyle<br />and his expeirences thru 4 tours in Iraq is a real eye<br />opener for what our boys go thru over there .

B002C6K7N0|5.0|This is an almost perfect album.  Dialectic Chaos is the only weak spot, I hate gay ass solos for no reason and that song is just pointless, if your going to make an instramental take note from Metallica's Orion or something.  Other than that the album smashes and stomps all compitition proving that Megadeth are one of the best thrash metal bands of all time.
1609611543|5.0|I wanted to update you all on a recent discovery I made, regarding psoriasis. I have dealt with it for probably close to 20 years. It was getting pretty bad, to the point that I was smearing coal-tar ointment on affected areas for relief. As I read this book about 6 months ago I started seriously considering the possibility  that gluten and wheat are a negative part of the modern diet. One of the conditions he mentions (almost as an after-thought) that gluten can exacerbate is psoriasis.<br /><br />The book is pretty compelling, so I started experimenting with reducing gluten, mostly to help lose weight and for general health. I didn't actually think it would help the skin condition. After about 6 weeks, I noticed a dramatic improvement in my psoriasis. I had my first real remission in literally 20 years. I thought the cause might be the gluten-free diet, but I wanted to continue the experiment before making any conclusions. After 6 months, I'm confident enough to say that gluten could be a major contributor to psoriasis.<br /><br />Again, my psoriasis has improved dramatically, and stayed that way for a couple of months now. Considering that there is no known cure or even known cause, it's pretty exciting.<br /><br />I encourage you to read the book, and try the experiment on yourself. It's not easy at first, because gluten is in all bread, baked goods, pasta, etc. Even beer, so I switched to cocktails only! But I just went crazy on steaks, burgers, salads, potatoes, butter, potato chips etc.<br /><br />If you go gluten free for 6 weeks and see a real improvement, you may have found a significant way to improve your condition. I wanted to have confidence that it's real, and I actually think it is. It's not easy to give up gluten, but if it actually works for you I think you'll find it to be very easy considering the alternative.<br /><br />You have nothing to lose by trying this, so I really encourage you to pick a date, and go 100% gluten free for 6 weeks. Then, re-evaluate - imagine if it actually works!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I can imagine that readers are going to get sick of reading the same thing....so here is yet another review saying it again....don't waste your time with this app. I was happily playing the game. The whole running out of enery thing didnt bother me because I figured that by the time the energy ran out it was time for me to do something more productive anyway. I knew that I was not going to spend any money on this app so that wasn't a problem either. But was annoyed me was when all the timers were reset and some didn't work at all. Needless to say this app will be deleted. Hope they fix the issues with it though.
0446572993|1.0|I am usually a pretty big fan of Baldacci's books, but \\"The Innocent\\" read like something less than his best work.  Character development was lacking and the plot was reasonably thin and transparent at times.  I am usually not outwardly critical of the books I read, but this one was a real disappointment.  Not generally given to delusions of grandeur, but I deluded myself a number of times with the thought that I could have chopped up some Mitch Rapp, diced up some basic plots with a few twists and kicked out a basic approximation of this book on my own (with a *lot* of editing help of course).
B001FB55HQ|1.0|Terminator 4 is a disgrace to the Terminator series. The movie does not focus on the war that fans were expected to see. They do explain how John Connor becomes a Leader and he does not show any qualifications as a leader. The whole story focuses on a stupid guy who is considered to be a decommissioned Terminator. Near the end they have this guy talking with a jumbo computer wich is so lame and reminds me of the computer system from \\"I-Robot\\". The Kyle Reese Character is also too young and is extremly wimpy!!! Come on, John Connor is going to send this little guy to go back in the past and do it with his mom? They don't even expain how they send him back through a portal or whatever. Man this movie is totally awful!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and addicting very entertaining for kids under twelve if your a parent who needs something for their child to do
B00723NWJE|2.0|I have been to see Norah in concert and I own all her previous CD's.  This is a very disappointing CD.  The first track is alright but other than that it really sounds like she lost her creative magic, or co-writer.  Skip this one and let's hope she get back on her game again soon.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very fun and great game.u don't have to spend any real money to get far in the game.it does start to get hard around level 38
0345803485|2.0|I honestly don't know what to think about this book. I am amazed at how much hype is surrounding this book right now and the fact that millions of dollars were paid to create a movie of the trilogy.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is a young and naive girl who comes across as having self esteem issues which is why she falls for the first man to really show any interest in her, Christian Grey. Grey has some serious issues with intimacy and his childhood (which you never find out about in this book)and as a result he enjoys inflicting pain on women through sex. Since when did abusing women become sexy? Since when did a girl falling for a guy who has these issues become a strong female character? I don't know. So many things about this book was just wrong and I found myself in a love hate relationship with it. So many times I wanted to just ask for a refund on the book and quit it, but for some reason I had to finish it out. It was extremely repetitive and I got SO tired of Anastasia rolling her eyes and him threating to spank her, of her biting her lip and him telling her to stop it. Midway through I wanted to scream at her myself - just stop biting your effing lip already I cant stand to read the same thing over and over! And the \\"oh my\\" and \\"oh eff\\" drove me crazy. Seriously, it's bad enough the author wrote that so many times, but didnt the editors think it was annoying? And why was Ana supposed to not be crying and be strong all the time, but yet anytime Christian upset her she was crying.<br /><br />Basically the book went like this:<br /><br />Ana fell on the floor and stumbled. She was nervous. Grey picked up on her nervousness and decided to try to pursue her. He shows up at her work. Long story short - they have sex. She's a virgin. He tells her he has a contract (which is ridiculous) - he starts getting possessive. She says oh my nearly every other page - when they have sex she says both oh my and oh eff. Dialog is something like this:<br /><br />Ana -Christian I dont think I can see you anymore.<br /><br />Christian - Why<br /><br />Ana - Because you scare me and I want more.<br /><br />Christian - I only punish and spank you as much as you can handle.<br /><br />Ana - (thinking - Oh my, he is so hot and look how his pants hang off his body.)<br /><br />Christian - Ana Im going to eff you now but dont touch me<br /><br />Ana - oh my (again)<br /><br />They eff, then they rest, then they eff again, she says like a thousand more oh mys...then suddenly everything is okay and she stays. Really?<br /><br />I'm amazed the author got as much money as she did and is making a movie!!I dont think I can see you anymore.<br /><br />Christian - Why<br /><br />Ana - Because you scare me and I want more.<br /><br />Christian - I only punish and spank you as much as you can handle.<br /><br />Ana - (thinking - Oh my, he is so hot and look how his pants hang off his body.)<br /><br />Christian - Ana Im going to eff you now but dont touch me<br /><br />Ana - oh my (again)<br /><br />They eff, then they rest, then they eff again, she says like a thousand more oh mys...then suddenly everything is okay and she stays.

B005HTC57K|5.0|Panda Bear's Tomboy was one of my favorite records of 2011, so I sold my single LP copy so I could buy this. The single copy is worth around $20, The 4LP box set is worth around $30. I think the $10 price bump is worth it.<br /><br />The box set records are black, not white, which was a little disappointing, but not a big deal. This set doesn't come with a download card like the single LP version does. The single LP is split into two LPs with a bonus track on side three. You'll need to switch the record twice as often for the same album. There isn't an infinite runoff grove of drone on the last track like there is on the single LP set.<br /><br />The bonus track is very cool. The real treats here are the third LP of the single mixes. It's basically the entire album, remixed, in a different track order. I loved the original mixes produced by sonic boom, and hearing essentially the same album before and after his modifications is awesome. The box set also comes with instrumentals and a capellas on select tracks. There's also a lyrics book, which is good because you can't tell anything the singer is saying just by listening.<br /><br />If you don't mind having black vinyl instead of white vinyl and don't mind switching the side twice as often, and having the infinite drone on Benfica isn't a deal breaker, for $10 more you get a bonus track, a ton more artwork, a lyrics book, and the entire album remixed. I thought it was worth it.  All profits, according to the sticker on the front, go to the american cancer society.
0545405777|5.0|This item is awesome.  Very classy and stylish. I just wish the other books were available in this collector's edition. It looks like a piece of simple but elegant piece of art.

B007R41E8O|4.0|The graphics and interactivity is very well done. Very interesting storyline that keeps the player in suspense. The ease of use is more than I expected on the kindle fire which is an amazing device that has exceeded my expectations.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Without doubt, this series is the worst ever put on paper. Every other one star reviewer has already listed in great detail why you should NOT bother with any of the 50s. Unless you're into poorly written BDSM, emotional abuse, and/or vague references to anorexia (seriously how many times did she 'whoops forgot to eat for three days' /lose her appitite?) do not waste valuable life moments on this steaming pile of crap.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best book series I've read. I couldn't make myself put it down! I would recommend it for anybody.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|Storm Corrosion, the collaboration between Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth and Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, offers some intriguing, unpredictable journeys into what I would describe as mood music.  A few words that occur to me while listening are dreamlike, lush, serene, hypnotic, mellow, haunting, ethereal, exotic, and, at times, dark.  Beautiful acoustic work and captivating ambient passages intertwine for some entrancing zone-out music; it's easy to get lost in the soft, poignant melodies of each song.  For me, it took a few listens to really absorb the multiple layers of sound and appreciate how it all flows together.  I listened to the first track Drag Ropes once and thought it was ok, then I listened to it a second time and thought it was pretty great.  By the third time, I loved it, and the rest of the album had much the same effect.  Now I have to hear it every day, sometimes more than once.<br /><br />The CD's six songs alternate between strange, surreal ambience and delicate, melancholic folk.  There's a stark contrast from dark to light between the first two songs, Drag Ropes and the album's title track.  Drag Ropes is at times nightmarish, especially coupled with the Tim Burton-esque video released for it, while Storm Corrosion is a beautiful track, its haunting acoustic reminiscent of Opeth's Orchid (or even Led Zeppelin or early Black Sabbath).  The tone shifts back into darkness with Hag's rhythmic pulse and odd section of semi-heavy guitars and the album's only spurt of drumming.  Then, Happy mixes the strangely warped acoustic sound of Watershed with lighter, Still Life melodies akin to songs like The Moor or Benighted.  After this, it's back into more trippy territory with Lock Howl, a brilliant instrumental that I wish was at least twice as long as it is.  Ljudet Innan closes soft and serene, with some of Mikael's most ambitious vocals to date in the opening minutes.  My only complaint is that this album isn't longer, the six songs clocking in at close to 48 minutes.  I would've gladly taken a couple more ten-minute tracks.  If you get the special edition, it has instrumental versions of all the songs, but I just can't seem to get enough of this music.  Great stuff by Mikael and Steven.ose to 48 minutes.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|The action and special effects are great, but this movie shouldn't be called \\"Star Trek.\\" All of the main characters in the movie have different personalities than their counterparts in the original series. For example, in the movie Kirk is rebellious, rude, arrogant, and very annoying. In the original series, Kirk has none of those qualities.<br /><br />The movie also does things that contradict the original series. For example, in the movie the planet Vulcan is destroyed. But, in the series Vulcan is intact. Also, Captain Pike promotes Kirk to First Officer for no reason. In the original series, Kirk earned the rank of Captain. All of these changes are annoying and very unnecessary. Why couldn't the director and writers keep the movie more similar to the original series?<br /><br />There are also a lot of problems with the plot. If a star went super nova, a black hole wouldn't be able to \\"suck up\\" the star! Also, even if the black hole could \\"suck up\\" the star, the star would then disappear, and everyone on Romulus would freeze to death. An advanced society like the Romulans would know that their star is about to go super nova and evacuate their entire planet.<br /><br />Also, time travel violates the Temporal Directive, and Star Fleet has a division that investigates and corrects occurrences of time travel. If a Romulan ship traveled 129 years into the past, Star Fleet would send a team to intercept and destroy the ship!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this edition. Its wonderful to be able to cross reference different versions of the Bible. The audio feature is a plus too.
B0014ESMCY|5.0|For musicians, the fact that Scott LaFaro is on this album is reason to study it. LaFaro was one of the promising bassists who did not leave behind a large body of recordings before his untimely end.<br /><br />However, even had Lafaro lived to a ripe old age this is still an important album for a number of reasons. There is a discernible change in Bill Evans' playing in the ensuing months between Kind of Blue and this album. On Kind of Blue his solos were tentative at best, and when hard swinging was required on \\"Freddie Freeloader\\" Miles had Wynton Kelly sit in on that track. That is not to say that Evans' contribution on Kind of Blue was substandard because it wasn't. The flowing, mountain stream quality that Miles specifically wanted made that album work. That same quality in Bill Evans' playing is present on this album, but he swings and seems to exhibit boldness and confidence that was lacking just eight months prior.<br /><br />The real beauty is the trio as a unit. Motian-LaFaro-Evans is locked in as a unit and the music on every track is not only breathtaking, but groundbreaking because everyone is playing as equals with a single mind instead of in a formulaic piano trio format.<br /><br />There are a number of reasons to own and delve deep into this album: the music, the musicians, the musical direction, and other reasons that I have not thought of, but are as valid.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Have you STILL not read this book? Then read it...if you are a sucker for an all-consuming LOVE story with lots of action too( bedroom and otherwise) It's not all about BDSM and sex, although that is a major part of the whole story.<br />I love the 2 main characters - Ana & Christian - I love how they their characters go through an emotional whirlwind and develop throughout the trilogy.<br /><br />It has funny, heart-warming, heart-stopping, sexy, passionate moments. I could not put these books down!!And have re-read them twice!!! Read the sample first and you will either get drawn in from the beginning and if you are not then don't bother, also don't bother if you are into arty, meaningful literature, because that it is not. I am now Greysessed and lovin' it - DEAL WITH IT!! (shouty caps) There are so many little \\"greyisms\\" and in jokes and I love that too!!  Laters baby :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Have read the first five books in the Wool series and enjoyed them all, best thing I've read since the Hunger Games trilogy.  Look forward to First Shift-Legacy (#6 in the series) and hopefully more to come, it's a universe I hope the author continues to explore.  Highly recommended.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game so much, when I play it, I tilt my kindle fire like it will actually help! Its so funny!!!
B0055SWM08|4.0|fun and addictive and just the right amount of attention needed while sitting on couch with significant other who is watching a sporting or reality Tv show.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|Great family movie. Its funny and entertaining. A must see movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Fun for all ages.
0345803485|1.0|I didn't even read the book fully, just trying to save other people from wasting their money. I perused it thoroughly in my local grocery store. It's embarrassingly bad. If you're interested in this type of stuff, read JR Ward instead. She is fantastic with some hot sex sprinkled throughout her books. She writes Black Dagger Brotherhood, hot sexy vampires who are guys you love and want to hang with~she even has 1 book that has a definite BDSM bent, Vishous' book, Lover Unbound. Try any of her books or Kresley Cole, Larissa Ione, Gena Showalter, all of whom can write books that aren't laugh out loud bad!!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This Amazon E book provides a view inside North Korea's political prison camps which are estimated to hold 200,000 people. The book was written after interviewing the prisoner involved. The odds against his escape were tremendous but he succeeded. I highly recommend this book.
0670023329|5.0|A bone chilling story of horrific evil in North Korea. My hope is that millions would read this book, be inspired to act, and that the North Korean government would be put to a definitive end. The government officials of North Korea are plainly guilty of crimes against humanity. This book can be read in one sitting - excellent writing, careful research, incredibly eye-opening. The slave camps in North Korea - and the systemic abuse of the entire population by a ruling elite - must come to an end.
B006RUJST6|5.0|You know those books that are equal parts sad and romantic and beautiful?<br /><br />Books that deal with death, but also leave you feeling so incredibly alive?<br /><br />Gorgeous books that stay with you forever, like Sarah Ockler's TWENTY BOY SUMMER and Jandy Nelson's THE SKY IS EVERYWHERE?<br /><br />Well, add Colleen Hoover's debut SLAMMED to that list.<br /><br />If you are looking for the book that will get you out of your reading slump, or you need a book to change your mind about the stigma that self published books are inferior- this is it. Hands down. I promise.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|The game play is predictable but oddly addicting. There is not much more to add than that. The good news is that the accumulation of coins happen even when you're not 'in the game'. The trick is to remember to come back often to collect the coins and restart the clock on the collections.
0307951529|5.0|What this book is is possibilities. There are countless case-studies of people who've gone out on their own and succeeded. These aren't studies on the same type of business over and over either. The examples are from so many different types of businesses I'm not sure I could say that someone who really wanted to couldn't succeeded. $100startup got me thinking about my own goals and my own fears, which really put things into perspective. As an added bonus there are also worksheets placed throughout the book to help get you started. I highly recommend this book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|with free cloud memory and syncing of notes, this note tool is my favorite app. I can put together Writing assignments and edit them with a fancy-free worry of my use for bullets and lists.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Since buying a DSLR camera a year ago, I have either bought or borrowed a number of books - all designed to help the beginner photographer.  None of them has improved my photography as much as this book did within the first chapter!<br /><br />Understanding Exposure is easy to read, interesting and relevant to the beginner photographer.  The author's experience as a teacher is evident and he guides you seamlessly through the techniques.  One of the problems I had with other books was that they told you what you \\"should do\\", without referring to some of the common mistakes people make or without checking that you actually understood the principles.  Bryan Peterson uses his own photographs to illustrate his points.  You can literally see the differences between the various photographs as he changes settings before taking a new photo of the same scene. The chapters flow logically and your experience level improves in leaps and bounds as you work through the book.  It is truly the only photography book that has kept me so engaged and has made an enormous difference to my photography.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is a fun game and take up for time I love it killing zombies has never been better asome
B00005JNEI|1.0|It's not even worth the 2 dollar supersale! This human surplus shouldn't be walking freely. He should be forcefully medicated and locked up away from people. Shame on Amazon for carrying this garbage.
0345803485|2.0|I read this book b/c it was being passed around my office as one of the \\"best books of the year.\\"  Within the first few chapters, I was so annoyed by the repetition that I almost just shut it and gave up(but I ALWAYS finish a book I start, so I carried on). The author seems to have picked a few \\"big\\" words that she knows and used them over and over and over again. I found the writing incredibly elementary!  The awesome thing about words is that there are SO MANY of them...plenty to choose from to depict an emotion/thought/whatever in a variety of different ways.<br />That said, I was intrigued by the story line...mainly because I have never read anything about a Dom/Sub lifestyle.  It isn't something I have any knowledge of and it was interesting.  I'm just glad I borrowed the book and didnt pay for it!
B00005N6KG|3.0|I bought these headphones to replace the earbuds are usually wear. They looked comfortable and earpieces look like they would fit right into my ear after receiving them I found this was not the case. While the earpieces fit mostly into my ear and the headset itself felt very light weight and comfortable after long-term use my ears began hurt(after 20 min.). I also noticed that while was riding my bike the earpieces would catch the wind alley be getting a \\"woo\\" sound in my ears along with music. Sounds kind of like being in your car have the music on and all of the windows in your car rolled down. Being I bought these to wear while riding my bike I will be reverting back to my earbuds.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game its wonderful its very additive I recommend it for everyone to try u cant put it down once u start playing
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first Hunger Games book is perhaps the best in my opinion. It is a great mix of action and romance with even some comedy. It is easy to read and keeps you entertained the whole time
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|A friend told me about her about 9 months ago and I intimidatingly fell in love with her first single \\"Video Games\\". I'd completely forgot about her until I was watching Gossip Girl one night, and yet again I was captivated by \\"Video Games\\". I did some research online, and decided to pre-order the album. I'm so glad I did!! Her voice in beautiful, and her lyrics are witty and clever. I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM! WISH MORE PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT HER......
B000J3OTSM|4.0|Hip hop is not my thing. But this movie was okay. Not among the best dance films I have ever seen by any means -- for my tastes -- but engaging. The plot was formulaic but it worked. Tatum was interesting because he looked unbelievably and yet believably dumb and yet genuine and with some worthwhile talent. So where would this kind of boy go with the girl? They seemed impossibly mismatched, and yet it held together. At first it looked as though it was going to be every rich girls' wet dream of a manageable strong but dumb semi-jock but they pulled that angle out of the dusty corner in the antique shop.<br /><br />The racial angle of a white boy comfortable in a poor black neighborhood well done in my opinion. Tatum seemed comfortably integrated and installed in that community and this was not overdone.<br /><br />So I think one can find this film interesting even if one is not into hip-hop.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface Two-Disc Anniversary Edition is a great souvenir and gift item. Scarface is a classic that a great for all homes. Not appropriate for children.
B00518HBD0|5.0|I have all of their CD's. If you don't have this one, don't hesitate to buy it. I think it rivals \\"A Better Life\\". If you don't have any 3 Doors Down CD's buy this one and \\"A Better Life\\" to start, but all of their work is outstanding in my opinion. A tip of my hat to the band, it's a pleasure listening to \\"Time of My Life\\"
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|the action is great and it has a story line a little disappointed with the end of the first movie. i guess they must be looking to make at least two maybe three.
0071762345|5.0|It's no wonder that \\"Likeable Social Media\\" is the number one selling book in several Amazon categories right now.  It's fantastic.<br /><br />Dave Kerpen has written what will likely soon be a classic.  It's the kind of book that we will all look back in five years, and say \\"He was right.\\"<br /><br />It's not only a great \\"how too\\" guide about how to build a brand using social media.  It's a vision of the future.  It's about a revolution in marketing whereby consumers will no longer listen when they are spoken to -- rather they will demand to talk back and be part of the conversation.<br /><br />I read the book over the weekend, and couldn't stop talking today, Monday, about social media in the office.  And I suggested that all my colleagues read this book.  I'm also a marketing teacher and I'm going to make the book required reading for my marketing class.  It's the best ROI I've had on my time in a long time.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Based on popular pulp fiction, \\"John Carter\\" (initially titled \\"John Carter of Mars\\") centers on a Civil War vet who finds himself transported to Mars. From here Carter rescues \\"A Princess of Mars\\" (a famous Pulp title) and finds himself in a war between alien races. Produced by DISNEY, this adaptation is unfortunately a piece DISNEY threw in the garbage before it was released in theaters focusing very, very little on marketing. It's not a bad film nor is it the greatest summer blockbuster. For me, the most memorable moments was the arena scene and the gorgeous Lynn Collins. It's a fun ride while it lasts but don't expect a sequel because in DISNEY's minds, it bombed before it hit the box office. Look for it on DVD and BD in June.
B004SEUJNM|4.0|Yes, the quality is what you'd expect of a blu-ray, but with no extras I wish I had purchased the 2-disk DVD. Disappointing to say the least.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I will start of with all the good parts about this headset.<br />1) The Large Ear Cups cover my ear completely  allowing me to wear it for hours with out any pain<br />2) The Sound is amazing Playing battlefield 3, i can hear footsteps coming up behind me in time to save my life, or hearing gun fire in the far distance before it gets to me.<br />(and since its 7.1 virtual surround sound i get a pretty good idea in which direction the sound is coming from)<br />Playing music is really good, a wish the bass had more kick but its decent enough<br />3) mic flips up (which also mutes the mic)<br />4) wireless, can reach almost around my whole house with out losing connection.<br />5) has a voice changer built into its software<br />6) 3 (G) that can be used to change music/voice changer<br />7) battery life last a decent amount of time 10 hours i think it was<br />8) Cancels most outside noise so all your getting is your music/movie/game noise.<br /><br />Now to start with the cons<br />1) my first pair of this headset had the plastic clips that keep the ear cups cracked, calling up logitech was simple and they got me a replacement headset in a decent amount of time, but had to call them back twice to remind them as after the first time i called they never contacted me back about the shipping label<br />2) does not work around microwaves at all<br />3) because of the plastic clips breaking it would be nice to have a case or stand which it does not have either<br />4) when moving the ear cups they make a bit of noise which is not a problem at all once they are on your head but just dosnt sound to right when your putting them on<br /><br />Over all this is a good headset and a big upgrade from what i had been using as i had some old other Logitech headset that i had been using for many years before this one, which was falling apart. I would recommend this headset, but id also say its something that could be waited for, so it would be better to buy it on sale as its price tag can be high for some people.
0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup is an absorbing, inspiring read that prompts successful entrepreneurs to review their business model and offers those just starting out valuable insight from the field.<br /><br />After following Chris and his Art of Non-Conformity blog for quite some time I was very much looking forward to reading this book. As a young full-time RVer the important combination of freedom, passion, income, and doing work that matters is always top of mind. The $100 Startup offers a concise roadmap for those seeking independence and to live life on their own terms.<br /><br />That being said, Chris is clear that starting and developing a successful 'microbusiness' is indeed work, albeit a labor of love. The 'do what you love and the rest will follow' mindset is replaced by the more practical concept of convergence - 'your passion + what others care about'.<br /><br />Throughout the book we are inspired by examples of people just like us that have unexpectedly or intentionally created businesses around what they have to offer and what others need. Some entrepreneurs profiled in the book have made a huge splash while others have quietly conquered their corner of the world.<br /><br />Each chapter offers actionable and specific details on the topic at hand. Some examples are given in graphical or chart format and readers will find key points - or takeaways - at the end of each chapter. The 'Fish Stories Appendix' presents a thought-provoking chart offering 25 selected case studies focusing on their fact-based descriptions and emotion-based promises. From concept to promotion to growth strategies to fear of failure, Chris has your back.<br /><br />Regardless of where you are in your life, your business or your relationships, Chris refers to Seth Godin's mantra, 'ship', and offers this wise advice: 'You don't need anyone to give you permission to pursue a dream'.<br /><br />If this calls to your dream, get this book, stop 'making a living', and start making a life.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Strangeland harkens back to Keane's roots. Piano driven melodies orchestrated by Tim Rice-Oxley, accompanied by simple yet powerful percussion from Richard Hughes, capped off by heavenly vocals from Tom Chaplin. Add in bass riffs from newest member, Jesse Quin, and you round out a sound that can only be described as elegant and pure. The melodies and lyrics blend so perfectly that one is easily lost in a trance during each track only to be awakened and transformed by the next. Their music is heartfelt and genuine, something lacking in today's pop genre. The world needs more bands like Keane and I thank them for providing us with something that can uplift the soul and remind us what it was like to truly be moved by music.
0307951529|5.0|What is your passion? What are the skills that can take you from ordinary to successful in a matter of days or months? This book won't tell you that. It is your creativity and your own perception of success that will allow you to thrive in the marketplace called Now.<br /><br />Chris Guillebeau's latest book must have been a labor of love - there are plenty of examples to be inspired by, whether one is interested in how to start a consulting business or how to turn a struggle in life into a profitable side income and dance all the way to the bank. A must read for anyone daring to get more out of life!<br /><br />- with due respect to the advance copy, congratulations on a text well done.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found this book amazing!! I couldn't put it down. It has a great basic love story to it with just enough raunch and sex.. Great way to spend my free time instead of my medical studies.. Just the right book to fantasize and perhaps experiment a little with my husband lol
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The Lion King still stands as one of my all time favourite Disney movies and as thrilled as I was to get the Special Edition DVD, the Blu Ray really surprised me. What great detail! The cover is superb and the menu has a lot more options than the dvd player and not to mention multi-region as well, all advanced!<br />The picture quality is superb and my old VHS copy was very watered down,. It looked like a poor remastering of an old colour tv. Thankfully, the dvd and blu ray got rid of all that and contrasted the colours.<br />The same thing goes for Bambi, which I have also got on blu ray, Pinocchio and Beauty and the Beast. The rest are still being planned. I am looking forward to 101 Dalmatians coming out on blu ray!
B00136JS12|5.0|Instant download. Sounds excellent. Brought back memories of surf music & cruising around the island . Excellent melodic harmonies blended together is what this band is made of.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Very good ending to the series of good.  Keeps you on the end of your seat.  Can't put down book.  Makes you wish there was more the the series.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter is an amazing adventure for the entire family. From the beginning shot of mars to the very end, you are swept away into an adventure that makes this film classic. The characters are lovable and the story is rich. Although many might be discouraged by the changes made from the original novels, they do not harm the film's story, they in fact enrich it. This is a success in my eyes, it is not a flop at all. Congrats to the team who worked hard on this!
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This is a must read for anyone thinking about starting a creative business, and a good read for those who already have one. Chris covers the entire process of getting started with a creative business. It's by no means a how to guide, but he never claims it to be.<br /><br />The case studies were fantastic, and I'm hoping to see more details about some of them on the $100 Start-up website.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I just wanted to say that I highly enjoyed this movie. Also, to everyone complaining that they received \\"Burned\\" copies in their factory sealed DVD and Blu Ray cases, that was how Sony packaged the disc. It is not a burned copy, it is how the disc was made to look by Sony to keep in feel with the hacker style of the movie. Google is your friend. With that being said, if you are a fan of David Fincher films, and a fan of the original \\"Tattoo\\" Trilogy, you will be a fan of this film.
0345803485|5.0|I am currently reading the third book and I love them all. The only disappointment was that the books were over way too quickly. I couldn't wait to find out what happened in each book. What am I going to read when I'm done with the third one? I do have to say that I am in love with Christian Grey. I would totally date/marry him.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read the entire trilogy and just started re-reading the books again! The author pulls you into the book so you feel as if you are one of the characters! She takes you on a journey to places within you that you never knew existed! The story line is very HOT and steamy as well as very dark! I would recommend this trilogy to anyone looking for some hot sexy romance!
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love reading her stories.  They are always filled with fun quirky characters, that keep me amused.  I've got your number is another good book, kept me laughing and loving the main character.  Predictable as her stories are, but still very enjoyable.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I just got this blu-ray a few days ago. I saw this film when it was first released back in 1994. Such a classic. Always loved it. I remember it being very dark and had a lousy copy on vhs. Now I can watch it on my 70 inch sharp led flatscreen. The audio and video quality is excellent. Kudos to the studio for giving the film a great blu-ray upgrade. Extremely happy!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I too like this game bug like the others my timers went really high.  I waited iuf the time and was able to play again.  Now it says that everything is ready but I cant collect on them.  the crops say ready but they clearly aren't.  you can add new items but.. what do you to with all the unusable stuff.  also reported thus several days ago and haven't heard a peep.  to make matters worse I have it on my iphone and it works great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty good time killer only played a few times. some of the games have are controlled a bit weird. but over all its not to bad
B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book would not end. It could have ended after the first 40% of the book. The book skipped over situations that should have gone more in depth. SPOILER:<br /><br />Abby really needed to make up her mind because she changed it 10 times in the book! Travis, if you think about it, is what I would define as an abusive boyfriend. Abby just needed another daddy.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|What else can really be said about this?? I don't even write very many music or movie reviews (even if I love a film), but this was simply so magnificent I felt compelled to speak on it. Seriously, I'm not gonna make a point to go into some long drawn out review b/c, others truly have summed up far more succulently everything I could say about this. But best believe if you're a Bob fan this is truly a MUST SEE! Heck, even if you don't know much about him and his music you NEED to learn yourself up on this and watch. I actually didn't realize there was a documentary out for at least a full week after its initial release, though ironically I had been listening to (what I later put together as) the OST. And let me tell you, they truly nailed the musical experience in this one (as others have stated)! It was absolutely so enlightening to get such a deep insight on how some of the songs had so much more of a powerful meaning! Not to give anything away, but the segment on his earlier years and the song \\"Cornerstone\\" was particularly deep and awesome b/c, the true meaning of it was so much more mind-blowingly different than what I had ever imagined that song was! And that's just one example out of many...<br /><br />I'm dead for real, whether you're a Marley fan, a fan of peace, love, and life--WHATEVER--you simply NEED to watch this!
B002M87W2W|5.0|You can't.<br /><br />Nor can you stop this Vincente Minnelli film, his first masterpiece, from snatching your heart.  The very fact that I said \\"first\\" leaves the door wide open for debate and conjecture. Will he have a second?  Yes.  But how can you fault this?<br /><br />Flaws?  A few. A fleeting few.  No need to bother with them.  What Minnelli has done here is take all the personalities of a family, in a cohesive and comprehensive effort, and make them whole.<br /><br />It couldn't have been easy.<br /><br />Minnelli had to take an unwilling star (Judy Garland) and the mistress of the producer (Lucille Bremer) and a child wunderkind (Margaret O'Brien) and Leon Ames and Mary Astor and Mr. Davenport (grandpa) and Marjorie Main and the other little girl - oh what is her name as I write this? - and make a story.<br /><br />Everyone worked on it.  Everyone.  Bits and pieces of that script got thrown out in favor of bits and pieces of a new script.  Then all of it was tossed out and more people were hired to give us what we see today.  Maybe even a few more writers worked on it.<br /><br />But Minnelli believed in it and so it became one of the most cherished musicals in film history.  For an originally reluctant star, Judy Garland shines.  Her \\"The Trolley Song\\", \\"The Boy Next Door\\" and, most exquistely, \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" are stupendous.  For the first time since \\"Oz\\", her songs are hers and hers alone, and it isn't just the Technicolor.  Minnelli knew just how to direct her and here he does so with light and shadow and an obvious appreciation of her talent.  He lets her shine.<br /><br />And shine she does.  She is the star of this multi-faceted show.  Margeret O'Brien has her big Halloween scene, and her meltdown with the snowmen, and those scenes are great.  Awesome.  But when push comes to shove, it is always our originally reluctant star who charms us completely.<br /><br />A masterpiece.
0385523394|4.0|Young woman has some wild times in her youth, makes some mistakes, gets scared and<br />straightens up.<br /><br />Years later, the wild times behind her, in a different life now, the Feds knock on the door.<br /><br />It's a engaging read of someone unexpectedly thrust into prison to pay for crimes from years ago.  Piper Kerman writes about day-to-day life and the community of inmates.  If you're looking for an expose or some risque account of life in a women's prison, you'll be disappointed.  But if you would like a considered view of prison from the inside by an inmate alert to the nuances of her environment and her own reaction to it, you'll probably enjoy this book.
0307951529|5.0|Is it realistic to build a life you love doing work you enjoy? YES. But this is not a \\"follow your heart and the money will come\\" manifesto. There's a big emphasis on the convergence of your passions and doing what's valuable to other people. This is a smart, responsible, inspiring study of what it takes to make it on your own in microbusiness.<br /><br />There are a lot of great case studies and stories from entrepreneurs that make the theories behind the book relatable. I most appreciated the simple and actionable instructions like \\"Seven Steps to Instant Market Testing,\\" The One-Page Business Plan,\\" and the \\"Reality Check Checklist.\\"<br /><br />Many of the stories are about people who stumbled into their own business. I would have liked more stories about people who made a more deliberate decision to start-up in addition to the stories of the unexpected entrepreneurs.<br /><br />A great read if you're ready to have your excuses and obstacles taken away for working on your own terms. Clear, specific instructions. An engaging read. I would recommend this book to friends and colleagues.
B006ZZANG0|3.0|POSES and WANT ONE represents Rufus' best work and since the latter came out, I've yet to completely dive into a Wainwright piece and become totally enthralled. I think Rufus is a unique talent with a keen eye for arrangements and melody, but OUT OF THE GAME contains only a few momentary sparks of brilliance. Despite a return to pop music, his songs lack the hook in either lyrics or melody that draw you in the way that \\"I Don't Know What It Is\\" or \\"Vibrate\\" still do. These songs beckon and command your attention while the songs on OUT OF THE GAME rarely reach a musical crescendo of any kind; they simply wallow along until they're done and then forgotten. I think he still has it in him to produce an amazing piece of work; this set of tunes just doesn't have the driving sense of urgency or artfulness relfected in his earlier works.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Very useful and it makes the body weight just great to put L sized lenses safely and have more weight on body side which should be he case
B007EC6FIS|4.0|Depending on which press review you've read, you'll either come away with the impression that this album is either a step backwards or an exciting step forward.<br /><br />Listen to it for yourself and I think you might find it's a little bit of both.  By step backwards I don't think there's been a regression in the negative sense, it's more of a progression without forgetting what makes Keane's music so beloved: lush melodies, poignant lyrics, and musical performances next to none.<br /><br />If you can spring the extra cash, buy the Deluxe version.  The extra tracks rival, and in some cases surpass, the tracks on the regular album.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Shantaram is one of the best novels I have ever read. While it is long (about 1,000 pages) and frequently harrowing it is so well written and uplifting that I found it hard to put it down. It is a story full of emotion and human philosophy - I would give it 6 stars if I could.<br /><br />The amazing thing is that the novel is almost auto-biographical. Roberts was born in Australia and became a drug addict after a failed marriage and loss of custody of his daughter. He was imprisoned for 19 years for a string of armed robberies performed to support his heroin addiction. He escaped from prison and fled to Mumbai where lived in the Mumbai slums. He lived in the slums for years and set up a clinic to help his neighbours. He became an addict again and worked for the Mumbai mafia. Eventually he was recaptured and finished his sentence in Australia and then returned to Mumbai.<br /><br />The story follows Roberts' life story pretty closely in fictional form. If you have been to Mumbai you will especially enjoy the beginning where the main character, Lindsay, is picked up by an Indian taxi tout thinking he would go to a luxury hotel - but Lindsay finishes up living in the slums with the taxi tout who becomes his best friend.<br /><br />Shantaram is the name given by his Indian friends, or Linbaba or Lin, the larger-than-life hero, which means \\"man of God's peace\\". This is what his Indian friends think of Lin.<br /><br />Please read it if you like a story with substance, philosophy and intense human emotions - I am sure you will love this book. A book with nearly 400 five star ratings speaks for itself.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I can play this app for hours and I do. great free version of the game we all know and love.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|so it is a lot of fun to play,  but on the Kindle you cant log in with facebook.....I tried 100 times....so I log in with email....just inconvenient
0765340798|2.0|It's actually several stories in 1 book. The main 1 being the battle for Corrin. Others include a planet Dune story  (since it appears totally disconnected, I assume it was added so that the word DUNE could be displayed on the cover in big gold letters).<br /><br />Of the others, only the defeat of the Daleks (sorry Cymeks) was vaguely interesting and even that got silly at the end.<br />Waste of reading was the origin of the; Mentats, Bene Gesserit, space guild and any other cult that all appeared at the same time, for no apparent reason.<br /><br />As for the main story, I'll just repeat what others have said; it's described through many conversations between main characters who appear to converse like a bunch of teenagers on a school playground (edit: think early Dr. Who). The characters are so immature, the decisions based on flawed reasoning and the surprises so obvious, even a bunch of chimpanzees could see them coming.<br /><br />1 star for the Cymeks, and 1 for the easy reading format .. the short chapters work when the writers are unable to hold your attention for more then 5 pages.<br /><br />If you like enjoy early Dr. Who and Daleks stories, you too might enjoy parts of this.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Look, I was skeptical, too.  Not because I was in love with any particular take on Sherlock--it's just there have been too many.  I'm old enough to remember several, and apart from the coziness of a Mrs. Hudson-run flat somewhere on a street I know well enough to say doesn't exist,  I never really GOT what all the fuss was about.  But man-o-man, was I a dope!  It isn't just that Watson's now ex-Army (so don't turn your back on him), or that the chimerical Rupert Graves is Lestrade to a \\"T\\" (along with subtleties like his accent: working-class softened by twenty years of immersion in City crime).  Or that Holmes' voice is deep enough to narrate the Apocalypse.  Nope.<br /><br />It's things like this:  Jim Morriarty is TERRIFYING--unstable, off-hand, slight and white as milquetoast,  and utterly mad.  He's actually more frightening--and I say this advisedly---than Heath Ledger's Joker.  Really.  I finally get Conan-Doyle's point, for heaven's sake!<br /><br />And that dark horse, Mark Gatiss, who's not only Mycroft but one of the series' writers, along with pal Steven Moffat.  This Mycroft is another revelation--slender, careful, deceptively soft-spoken, with redolent hints of his place at table with the Great and Good.  Fans of British tv may remember his well-meaning vet in the magisterial Leage of Gentlemen.  He's taken all that gawky, geeky height and folded it into a Saville Row suit with muted tie, a slow, cautious manner that.....but I'm babbling, and can't describe it.  Suffice to say only that he's a miracle.  My daughter has always loved the character of Mycroft.  Now I know why.<br /><br />It's the love--long-standing, fervent, mature--that writers and actors so obviously feel for the whole Tao of Conan-Doyle's Holmes--their respect--that most shines through the show's intelligence and fun.  Season One was just a taste; the second year is even better.  What more could you possibly ask of a Sunday night in?
B004FOA84A|3.0|Just like another reviewer,  I am also stuck with a pack of matches,  a goldfish bowl and a combination! would someone please help..
B005T3AJBS|5.0|I've seen JA twice since this album came out. It's definitely not the old Janes, but I really like it. Got some haunting melodies, one of which is going through my head right now. A bit more processed than some may like, but they pull this album off live perfectly, too.
B006TGWY3K|5.0|If you are a fan of them then buy it already and if you decide that you don't like it sell it. But seriously its a very good album, this is true.
0439023491|5.0|I really enjoyed book 1, but was really surprised by where book 2 took me. To have the competitions, characters, and friendships change was fascinating in the context of the games. A real commentary about humans becoming objects in our society.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Loved this game until everything kept resetting its timer to 35+ hours!  Then I couldn't collect from anything or harvest any crops.  If the bug on the timer was fixed I would give this game 5 stars.
B005P39GOI|5.0|First heard Ben Howard from the show \\"House\\" and decided to check his music out.  For 2 months now, I cannot stop listening to this album.  His voice moves you along with the acoustic guitar.  This is the perfect \\"chill\\" music.  This guy deserves to be recognized and listened to.  A couple of other songs you must listen to not on the album are \\"move like you want\\", \\"under the same sun\\", \\"depth over distance\\", \\"a hand to hold\\".  Amazing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Sooo addicting !! It reminds me a lot of super Mario world that I played as a kid :) highly recommend it.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|The very first time I came upon the compact disc, I was smitten. I knew instantly that they were my future and my long love affair with music,vinyl in particular, was going in another direction. I STILL love my cd's till the end (just as there is still a soft spot for vinyl in my heart), but I have seen the future and I must say, I am pleased, especially with the concept of entire collections on standing figurines like this Beatles apple. Imagine Pink Floyd on a pink pig, the Stones on the mouth, or even the Allman Brothers on a peach - all of which sit nicely on a shelf or around the room. Just pull out the plug end and plug it into your stereo and or video player! Sound quality better than ever too!!!<br />Can't wait to see what's next.
B007PS0X0W|1.0|Huge fan of the Underworld with the 1st (dominant vampires) and 3rd (dominant lycans) being my favorites.  The 2nd was a disappointment to me as it killed off Corvinas and his two sons (one bitten by bat and the other by wolf).  This 4th installment is dead last imo.  The futuristic story line that has Selene and her child venturing into a world where Vampire and Lycan are hunted by humans is boring.  The made up - unknown city where a giant lab and their workers control the population through vaccinations is very similar to Resident Evil.  Although, isn't it the same story line in a lot of D list movies.  This installment is nothing more than images thrown together with fight scenes, very little dialogue, Lycan heads exploding with gunfire, and a lot of fog/mist.  There apparently isn't much daylight in this pharmaceutically controlled futuristic city.  For some reason, they are unwilling to let go of the character, Michael.  Note: he was horrible in the second installment and having his offspring run around doesn't do anything for this storyline.  With the elders gone, the Vampires underground, and Lycans looking like oversized rats this movie failed.  A story as old as time:  Vampire against Lycan and humans seeking protection from the Vampires.  It shouldn't have changed.
B007HO392S|1.0|Haven't people had enough of this sound already?  It's like the same exact crap since the 70's, when will country music progress into something better?  Like what Shania did and a few others.  Boring boring boring boring boring!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and it is very cool. I love this app for its amazing games and the way it is set up.
B005HQ5S3G|1.0|Or maybe more like HELL!  The state of modern music has been literally destroyed because of generic boring modern pop crap like this!  Every song sounds the same!  It's uninspired, dull, and terrible!  When you look at half the music from the 70's and even the 80's it BLOWS AWAY of the planet this junk!  And isn't it also amazing all these idol winners, not a one of them can sing as good as the 70's or 80's artists?  I believe great singers are still out there, but they are being disregarded while one pop generic princess after another is put through the \\"machine\\" to push this garbage on the today's young audience.  They wouldn't know what good music even was unless they went back and listened to some good music mainly from the past.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|They did a great job formatting this classic! It reads easily, there are no typos that I have found yet and of course the book itself is... well... a classic! The story is one of a kind. One of those stories you can read over and over again.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game. but it does freeze up sometimes and you have to log off then back on again.  but I do like playing this
B004MC8CA2|3.0|love this on my screen at hand . the tool bar is easy to switch between versions as well. comparing text passages with the many versions provides clarity and understanding.
0393088774|5.0|A pleasure to read something so clear, informative, and civilized in presentation.  Good explanations and analogies that make such concepts as a \\"liquidity trap\\" comprehensible to us civilians.<br /><br />The screeching and hooting from the 1-star reviewers, however, also provides insight to what Dr. Krugman is up against with his policy recommendations.  Yikes.
1451673442|5.0|Wow it is really amazing book, it is arrived today, I started to read the first pages wow I really like it more than any book I read before!!<br /><br />Even the language used is really easy and clear.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I rented this movie while waiting for a flight at the airport Good movie. Fun for all ages. : )
0345803485|5.0|Wow after all the hype..and not liking porn..I must say I wanted to but was a bit hesitant to read this...BUT I am SOOOOO glad I did. This is so much more about LOVE and about how much abuse in childhood effects our adult relationships. Plus its just so fun to read. I read all three in a week. Bring on #4 and the movie...<br /><br />With NO kinky sex involved... this young,super fast n so in love story makes me think of my husband. Now of 18 years. I was 22 he 28. I was no virgin, But lived at home all through college and never lived with anyone other than my husband to date. We met and were engaged in three months, married within the year, just after my Sr. year in college. We were together every day since we met... and now after almost 20 years we do text ALL day long and some of its witty and dirty. He makes me laugh and giggle even now. He is hot, driven and he to was from an abusive childhood. I was not at all. Had two loving and nurturing parents. He needed and still does at times reassurance that I love him and tells me ALL THE time he loves me. We are lucky. That's why I love this book and the non stop sex has kicked ours into overdrive. Not that it needed it. Even non billionaire peeps can have this kind of LOVE FOR REAL. No stalkers ever either...lol BUt then again no one would want to read our story...LOL
1451629184|5.0|I'm not a huge reader at all, I find myself attempting to read books and quitting only halfway through..but not this book. I previously heard of Jaycee's story in a documentary, so I decided to try this book out, and it was AMAZING..totally raw, and a definite page-turner. The best part is seeing the way Jaycee grows up and matures in her mind and manages to stay sane. I didn't cry from reading it (yet) but it definitely has changed the way I loook at things in life!
B000W91RUG|5.0|The first Season of The Big Bang Theory is hilarious, with many funny and engaging episodes.  It is cool to see where it all started!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read all three books of the trilogy and by the end was so annoyed and hated the writer's use of all the British phrases and her style of writing.  Why oh why did she set the novel in Seattle if she couldn't write like an American?  I am not American but I know for a fact they don't say \\"hair ties\\" for elastics\\", \\"caught some sun\\" for getting a suntan, just to mention a couple of instances.  The book is rife with this.<br /><br />The worst and most annoying fault of this book is the writer's inability to differentiate between come/cum. She is supposedly educated and a writer, I would have thought she would know the difference.  And why didn't her editors make this change?<br />This author is not a very accomplished writer at all.  Without the shock value and the graphic sex scenes this book would not rate at all.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|It is to bad Steg Larsson passed before his books hit the big time.<br />Hornet's nest is a fine finish for the trilogy. I enjoyed all three books.<br />I read this one the fastest. Good books
0345803485|3.0|I admit I am only half way through with this book right now, but if I read one more time \\"I stare down at my hands\\", I am going to stop reading. Is it really important to mention this on every page?
1937986039|5.0|If you own a Fuji x10 and intend to use it as anything more than a big, heavy point and shoot, you need this book. The x10 has some sophisticated and unique functions, and while its menus are logical, they are complicated and not everything is easy to remember. You can learn all about the x10 by spending hours on the forums, or you can read this book. It's written in a clear, straightforward, friendly style. The author starts at an elementary level and works up to the complex. Beginners can read everything; more advanced photographers can pick up wherever. This isn't a book for your gadget bag--it's a little too heavy. But if you're spending $500+ for a camera, it is a worthwhile investment if you want to learn how really to use its features. Disclaimer: I was a pre-publication reviewer of the book. I liked it then and like it now. And no, I didn't get any money (and don't get a commission either!).
0307951529|5.0|This most recent book from Chris is an inspirational next-step in his ongoing quest to show everyday, \\"regular\\" people how to live life  -- and make a living -- differently, with purpose, and making the most of what they already have or know.  The book draws from a wide and varied array of real-life experiences, where individuals have used a number of unconventional approaches to simultaneously generate income and create a more fulfilling way to live life.<br /><br />The book strikes an excellent balance of Chris sharing wisdom from his own experience of \\"unconventional\\" living, and delving into the strategies and tactics many other micro-entrepreneurs have used to become successful (on their own terms and by their own definition).  Chris has an excellent writing style, which makes the book an enjoyable read -- while at the same time presenting many valuable examples, tips, and strategies for making a living in ways you might not ever have considered.<br /><br />If you haven't already read Chris's other book -- The Art of Non-Conformity -- I recommend you get both.  His perspective is a unique and refreshing alternative to the traditional thinking about how to make a living, and this book shows you how to get started without throwing caution (or your entire savings account) to the wind.<br /><br />[This review was based on an advance copy of the hardcover edition received from the publisher. I also made an advance purchase of the Kindle version -- so I could have a mobile copy with me for reference]
0307951529|5.0|When this arrived, I meant to just give it a quick skim and then get on with the rest of my tasks for the day. Several hours and pages of notes later, I called my husband to tell him he had to give it a read as well.<br /><br />Specific steps to get started as well as lots of inspiration on how to start a business on a tiny budget. And not just any business, but one that expresses you - your interests, your talents, and your skills.<br /><br />The book is filled with stories from people who started up business with minimal cash outlay, and are making at least $50K per year now. The case studies were interesting to me, with the a focus on how people who make a living from their passion.<br /><br />Most business book seem to fall into one of two camps - overly optimistic promises, with little concrete steps to take, or tomes of how to write business plans, with no emotional connection. Chris Guillebeau does a good job bridging the two.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|The movie Martyrs is not appropriate for the normal audience. I would not advise anyone to watch this flim if they are sensitive to female brutatily or violence against; but after viewing, I would have to say that it is the most meaningful film (that I've seen) of its kind.<br /><br />The angle this movie takes is one that cannot be anticipated. In the end, I felt the movie was more than I had bargined for. The message conveyed is that of such significance to those willing to see. I believe this film is much bigger than the violence it contains. As disturbing as it is it may be, it is a powerful display of cinematic freedom.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun but the controls freeze up some times overall this is a good game and I would recommend it to anyone ages 5 to 30 maybe.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|fair read.. hard to put down.<br />Started kind of slow but was hooked by the middle of the first book. It's better than the movie, so don't let that put you off.
0307951529|5.0|The $100 startup is an operations manual for a new entrepreneur. I especially like all of the case studies. At the end of each chapter there is a bulleted list of action items and key take aways which is a helpful summary. Page 23-39 are worth the price of the book all on their own. If you're thinking of starting a business, The $100 Start Up is your book.
0553801473|4.0|Now, like most other Song of Ice and Fire fans, I am willing to admit that the last entry in the series, [[ASIN:0553582038 A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)]], was not my favorite and that it got me worried that Mr. Martin had gotten a little too ambitious in his storytelling.  This latest entry has restored my faith that he knows what he is doing.  Taking us back to just after the end of [[ASIN:055357342X A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)]] and continuing the stories of characters who were left out of the last entry (Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Bran Stark, etc.), [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5)]] comes back to the most interesting characters and storyline in the entire series, i.e. the Wall and Daenerys' rise to power.  Like all of the previous novels, all of the characters are well fleshed out and engaging and Mr. Martin's patented cliffhanger chapter endings always leave you wanting more.  And knowing what happened in the last entry helps make this one all the more enjoyable (not knowing what was going on elsewhere was one of \\"A Feasts\\" biggest problem, I felt).  The wait for this fifth entry was well worth it.  I will say that I still fear that Mr. Martin has become too ambitious in his storytelling and I fear that he won't be able to finish the whole tale in two novels after this.  But, however many novels it takes, I will enjoy them just as much as I have enjoyed this one.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I don't normally go for period pieces.  Generally, they're boring and stiff, but thanks to Celtic Woman Lisa Kelly's review of Downton Abbey, I decided to give it a try and I am forever thankful I did.<br /><br />For some reason, season two DVD was released before it finished airing on PBS.  I searched high and low for season one, finally finding it at a Target store nearby.  I was hooked within the first few minutes of the first episode.  For a show that supports about 20 characters at a time, it flows perfectly.<br /><br />Season one ended with Lord Grantham annoucning that England was at war.  Season two picks up with the war on in full force and the sacrifices made by both the servants and the Granthams and their families.  A few new faces bring a new mix to the already proven theory that is this show.  I can't wait until season three airs next year stateside.  If it is anything as good as its previous two seasons, I'll be on the edge of my seat for a couple months.<br /><br />Matthew and Mary are still at it, dancing in their \\"will they or won't they\\" waltz and with new his new fiance added into the mix, it leaves viewers wondering every week what will happen.<br /><br />Downstairs, the servants are still at it which is one of the best parts of this series - seeing what goes on downstairs as well as upstairs.<br /><br />Oh, Mr. Bates...I have to wait an entire year to see you and Anna again.
0374275637|5.0|Even though this book is scientific, it is easy to understand, and the concepts are fascinating.  It also has a strong emphasis on psychology and the combination is a brilliant look at how the we come to the conclusions we base our decisions on.  It is a great book for anyone looking to maximize their potential!
B007VGXS8M|5.0|amazing. I cant stop playing. ive litterally stayed up till 4 am... i cant find the book in old japan. second to last board. with all the crazy faces and whatnot
B003L20ICE|4.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" on DVD. It concerned two women who lived together and had kids by the same male donor. Okay, it's a bit unusual but it could easily happen in this day and age. In any case, the kids discover their father and contact him, much to his surprise. A warm friendship develops between them and their biological father and between him and the two women and he ultimately has an affair with one. It's an interesting modern-day story and rather well done, and in good taste I might add. The acting is excellent. The directing is good. The story seems completely believable, although I dozed off toward the end. It's a worthwhile movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. I just cant quit playing it and my brother loves it more than I do! !!!!!!!!!!!!
B002EX7GBC|4.0|Finally, a non-animated version of Peter Pan you can love. The character portrayals are delightful. Peter is played by an age appropriate boy who has all the charm and mischievousness you would would expect from the sly, cunning, and delightful character in the book. Captain Hook is dastardly, the Indians are lovable, Wendy and the boys are charming and brave. And Tinkerbell is deliciously single minded, easily beset by fits of jealousy. The sets and photography are very well done and the special effects add to the magic of the story. Thgis is by far the best version of Peter Pan out there, a delightfully entertaining tale for all ages. Adults will not be coddled. This is no saccharine tale but a raucous adventure sure to please everyone.
B00709GTGS|5.0|Had this on regular dvd, but wanted it on blu-ray as anyone would know. Good story and acting. Type of picture you can watch many times. C6
0307951529|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. What I like most in this book were the stories by such a diverse group of people.  Some books make you feel you have to be a certain way (extrovert-ish, extremely creative, venture capitalists, technologically saavy, etc.) Chris has provided us a book that many people can relate to.  What we have is what we need.  It has inspired me to take ... the next step.
B001EBWIUO|5.0|As anyone knows this is a great story about the way people handle each other.  The blu-ray print is very good. Probably the best Bogart picture as far as his acting ability. There are many good films that he has made, but this causes you to examine<br />his skills as an actor. C6
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I love this production of Phantom.  Ramin is by far the best phantom I've ever seen.  You can feel his emotion as he sings.  Sierra is also flawless as Christine.<br /><br />Question:  Does anyone else have a problem getting to the opening auction scene?  I watched the DVD many times, and for the first time today, I was able to see the opening auction scene as a fluke.  When I tried again (turning off and on the DVD player), I could not get to that scene any more.  It jumps right into the scene where the chandelier is uncovered.  Does anyone else have this problem or is my DVD defective?  Would appreciate any response on this.  Thanks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|is  very enjoyable with all the games and all the different game types that's why I enjoy it to the full extent of my ability
0307951529|4.0|After following Chris' blog (and starting to write myself because of the things he'd written), and reading his first book, I was really excited to start reading the $100 start up.  I like almost all of Chris' writing, but especially the really meaty case studies he's seen of people making a living doing what they love.  This book is full of those, as well as Chris' own stories and practical advice on how to converge what you love with what people are willing to pay for.  I also liked how the book makes no false promises: he defines straight up that this isn't about creating the next Google: it's about microbusinesses to create freedom and get you doing what you want to do, for your own benefit.<br /><br />Overall, love the positive message, great stories and advice that anyone can apply if they're looking to become an entrepreneur.
0307951529|5.0|I don't believe there is anything unrealistic about the book.  I feel like the workload required to be successful is implied in the examples.  For instance, the 35 point Launch checklist, while being extremely handy, makes it pretty clear that there is a great deal of work to be done in advance just to get to that launch day.<br /><br />If is seems over simplistic, I believe it is because the passion and persistence required to become successful is more important that diving deeply into realistic examples.  In addition, I think using the term \\"realistic\\" and \\"unrealistic is based on an individual perception of what is possible.<br /><br />Building a business requires persistence, dedication, constant self-improvement, and 10x as much action/follow-through.  This is implied by the \\"One Page Business Plan\\" in the book.<br /><br />The $100 Startup isn't about using fancy letterhead or typing things up.  It isn't about getting more education or telling your self, \\"Once I do/have/become _________, then I can be happy, pay my bills, and do what I want.\\"<br /><br />It is about taking action and staying inspired so you can persist through that hard times.<br /><br />Chris doesn't talk a lot about the hard times but, again, the hardships are implied within warnings about how to handle bad customers, how to prepare for a launch, and many other things.<br /><br />One does not learn how to improve or help others become successful without having failed or fumbled through it themselves.<br /><br />If this is your first business, your first leap of faith into independence and providing for yourself, even if you are a seasoned and successful business owner... this book is a must read.  It will light your fire (which we all ALWAYS need) and you will definitely learn something new that you can put into action today.<br /><br />This book is worth it and it will make you money if you use it to take action.<br /><br />Three books that compliment this one REALLY well and will help you take profitable action:<br />- The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco<br />- Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman<br />- Unmarketing by Scott Stratten<br /><br />Onward friends!<br />Badass book, Chris.  Thanks for the advanced copy!  totally in love with it!nal MBA by Josh Kaufman  - Unmarketing by Scott Stratten    Onward friends!  Badass book, Chris.  Thanks for the advanced copy!  totally in love with it!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Just as a side note, I did not read this book through Amazon, but rather through the Barnes and Noble Nook.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that has a dash of everything, you want to read this!  It's got action, awkward parental relationships, an epic doomed romance you can't help but root for, and of course, the supernatural.<br /><br />Joining Sophia on her journey of self-discovery and ancestry is one hell of a ride.  Great character development, detailed imagery, a solid plot and clear writing style will have you yearning for more.<br /><br />I can't wait to continue on this journey with Sophia and Charles!

0785162348|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3DIJX5AWQ4PNL]]Just like other Marvel movie art books before, this is big and thick. In fact, at 272 pages, it's thicker than [[ASIN:0785155090 The Art of Captain America: The First Avenger]] and [[ASIN:0785151303 The Art of Thor]] which are both at 240 pages each.<br /><br />The cover looks great and it's actually a slipcase.<br /><br />Almost all aspects of the movie are covered. There are the Avengers themselves with their new costume designs, Loki, The Chitauri, flying leviathans and other characters like soldiers, Nick Fury, etc. The art is great and these are all printed big. The characters are mainly drawn by Andy Park and Charlie Wen. Most look very much like the actors. The Iron Man design is, as usual, amazing. There are also a few pages of Hulk art which are new obviously since there are no Hulk movie art books.<br /><br />Many locations, props and vehicles are featured as concept art. You'll see Bruce Banner's hideout home, Tony Stark's tower a breakdown of the technology that suit him into Iron Man or un-suit him, the warehouse where Black Widow was held, the Helicarrier and its interiors and even the tunnel Loki escaped in. The props are all sort of gadgetry shown in the movie, stuff like Hawkeye's bow, other weaponry, a sequence of Tony Stark suiting up into Man VII in mid-air. There is a lot to see because some pictures are filled with details. The visuals are spectacular.<br /><br />I think the layout is slightly chaotic because there's a lot going on with so many characters and big set pieces. The content is presented chronologically as they appear in the movie.<br /><br />The writeup is extensive and there's a lot to read about various part of the movies. This will probably be very interesting to those who want to find out how The Avengers differs in areas as compared to the comics.<br /><br />This is an awesome art book and informative movie companion. Highly recommended.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)t visit my Amazon profile for the link.)

B003O86FMW|5.0|A great 'second' book to the Hunger Games trilogy.  Suzanne Collins is an amazing author and keeps you wanting to read more.  The development of the characters and constant action make this book a great read.  I'm almost done the 3rd book now and will be sad when they are finished!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it. super duper fun! very addictive!! easy to learn and fun to play... even the kids can play!
0307951529|5.0|I've followed Chris for a few years now and he continues to share great stories, great insights, and to lead a life less than ordinary by example.<br /><br />With a great mix of inspiration and information, in this book Chris shares straightforward plans for entrepreneurial success -from both his own experience and in great profiles of other successful everyday entrepreneurs. These aren't Silicon-Valley-startup-drop-out-of-Stanford-technology-driven-entrepreneur-type stories; they're more guy-or-gal-mom-or-dad-from-anytown-usa-ditch-community-college-to-start-something-passionate-opportunity-driven type stories. They're real. They're accessible. They're detailed (with actual access to company financials, not vague generalities). And while the premises are usually micro-scale, there are ideas and methods here from which mighty oaks can grow. And the profits definitely aren't micro!<br /><br />If you're the kind of person who sees opportunities everywhere but thinks the money to get things started is nowhere, think again and give this book a read. You can start a lot with a little, and then go larger if that's what you're into. I'd also encourage artistic types to read Guillebeau's '279 Days to Overnight Success' (available free at his site) and also 'The Unconventional Guide to Art + Money.'

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I've been kicked on my butt with Iron Man my fav hero since I'm a kid. So far shame they did so many Hulk versions but this one appears to be complete. We have a new hero sending arrows like he was Daredevil without watching... the movie follows well Thor and Captain america both excellent movies. We haven't seen yet Wolverine that might appears in the next movie?! who was just asked by Iron Man to participate... whoever is on the team this is a stunning movie that blows me with such effects as 3D and simply with the whole story! I'm not keen with the end too close with the end of transformers where they destroy the whole city... but it is just an awesome feeling and the result of an accomplished dream with the new technology that makes me jealous about all that work done I wish I  could just do a half of it ;)<br /><br />I'll certainly watch it again in the theater before i get the disc.<br /><br />enough one of the best movie and Iron Man still beeing the greatest of all to me cos the effects and so closed shining metallic realistic view.<br /><br />every comic fan should have this in his collection!!!!<br /><br />well done

B000O8OTNC|4.0|really small and very light sharpener. ideal for hiking. comfort of the sharpening is not the best, but that is the price for the small size, so can`t complain much... happy with the purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The ebook was great.  My only problem was that I was charged twice for the same ebook and only got the one copy that was a gift for my daughter.  Not sure why the double charge but they don't seem to believe me that I only got it once and will not refund the extra charge.  I would probably not buy from Amazon ebooks again.
1590171993|5.0|I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewers who loved John Williams' Stoner.  it is heartachingly beautiful and sumptuously written.  The simple, \\"domestic\\" bare-bones of William Stoner's existence are superficially unremarkable.  However in their simplicity lies their universality:  I think the many who loved this book and the few who hated it, see in the protagonist's life their own stories.<br /><br />At times I found William Stoner's laconic passivity maddening.  The occasional spark to pursue happiness--a willingness to leave life down on the farm to pursue a life in academia is at first encouraging.  So too is the earnestness with which he pursues Edith, his first love and later wife.  Both examples though prove to be uncharacteristic.  William Stoner is a man to whom life happens--not one who goes out and pursues goals with any avidity or end result in mind.  When his marriage to Edith has failed yet she returns to reassert control over their daughter Grace, Stoner fails to fight for the daughter he has raised or for their love.  He lets himself be shunted aside, and the little girl to lose the love of a devoted parent.<br /><br />When he finds something like love with fellow teacher Katherine Driscoll he lets Lomax his nemesis drive her away.  He says he continues on in his loveless marriage and disappointing career for some foolish sense of being true to what he is.  Lonely?  A failure?  Soon however Williams' beautiful prose and generous nature began to work their magic.  If Stoner is a lonely failure he is a well-intended one. Not mean-spirited like his nemesis Lomax, a man physically,  emotionally and spiritually disfigured.  Nor is he flighty or abusive and hurtful like his angry and at times unstable wife.  Stoner always does his best, and tries to do right.  By his students, and by his daughter.  His failures are frequent, but so too are all of ours.  If at times he lacks courage, so do we all.  In the end he can look back on his life and if asked \\"who did you harm?\\"  He can truly say, \\"very few.\\" If asked \\"did you do your best?\\" He can truly answer, \\"nearly always.\\"  And if his best wasn't very brilliant, well, neither is ours.<br /><br />John Williams has created a marvelous portrait of every good man--a failure who has at least tried, again and again, to do right.did you harm?\\"  He can truly say, \\"very few.\\" If asked \\"did you do your best?\\" He can truly answer, \\"nearly always.\\"  And if his best wasn't very brilliant, well, neither is ours.<br /><br />John Williams has created a marvelous portrait of every good man--a failure who has at least tried, again and again, to do right.

B006W0QOF2|1.0|Oh, Cheez!<br />I was going to write a review about this movie, but you know what? i forgot what the movie was about. i guess the movie was that forgettable.I read in one of the poor reviews that the ending was horrifying! i guess i wasn't impressed, i really don't recall. that is the truth!
0307951529|4.0|Infinitely optimistic, Guillebeau coaches would-be entrepreneurs through the hard stuff and makes the entire enterprise a doable thing for anyone ready to give it a go.<br /><br />As someone mentioned in the book (I run the climbing gym with the unusual financial startup strategy), at first I thought, \\"This is a pretty interesting book, I'm sure, for someone who hasn't been there.\\" But it turned out that I was dog earing a number of spots in the book to take my business to the next level. I'm especially appreciative of the online guides he supplies and simple ideas for pretty much every aspect of the business.<br /><br />As someone who has four startups that she's carefully nurturing, I can tell you that this book offers sane advice for anyone ready to make the commitment without as many of the mistakes and confusion. But, I will also say that there are a number of things glossed over in the book that I wish had more attention: (1) the abject terror of owning a startup. Even if you are doing okay with a side job or full time job, it's not totally making the money that makes you feel okay. There's an element of insane stress and fear that comes with trying to reach whatever your measure of success is that exists in any start up that comes to the level of what Guillebeau suggests in his book. (2) While he talks about growth of your business, it would be nice to talk about what that really means. I found that as someone educated in anything but running your own business, talking about how to hire, government liabilities, and simply business structure, was really missing. I have yet to find a book that adequately covers this end, and that's where you get in trouble, for the most part. Perhaps this could be a follow up after the success of this one.<br /><br />Overall, this might be the very best book I've ever read on the subject of general business beginnings and startups for passion, not sales. I have read thousands of business books that generally spend too much time with case studies or long-winded points, but Guillebeau packs the punches with this one. It's the right size and it reads quickly. And like I said, I learned some things from it, too!with case studies or long-winded points, but Guillebeau packs the punches with this one.

0385533829|5.0|I ordered a copy of t his book for m y sister since it was so wonderful and she never received the book.  Sent two emails so far to Muse Media with no response.<br /><br />I rate this purchase as a 0 and very disappointed with all concerned that this hasn't been rectified.  The book was ordered over a month ago.<br /><br />Bad business!!
0300179553|5.0|Another beautiful publication from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  I've to admit I'm no Prada fan but I was attracted to this book on the prospect of having a chance to view some of Schiaparelli's beautiful creations.<br />This attractive book exceeded my expectations, it is beautifully bound and loaded with artistic fashion photography.<br />The photos present a mixture of clear archival images depicting Schiaparelli's elegant garments juxtaposed with colorful images from modern Prada collections.  Each photo has captions revealing their respective dates.<br />The text in the book is concise, there is a brief introduction at the beginning of the book, then there are several booklets scattered between the images and they reproduce several comments by both ladies explaining their sources of inspiration, techniques, and their approach to creative design.  The booklets may also contain some small photos, close-ups, or sketches.  The layout of those pamphlets is nice as they don't affect the beauty of the illustrations and they are printed on  high-quality paper.<br />This is a fine addition to any fashion and photography collection as it is both insightful and visually attractive.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game UNTIL I got to level 32. Then some kind of glitch happened. First my energy would not refresh. Then, the energy came back but only one building works. All of the others timers are counting UP in time, not down (to be able to collect money or perform actions). I saw a reviewer here complaining the goals got to hard, but that's not what the problem is. The problem is the timer counting up instead of down.<br /><br />You would think with the game forcing you into an updates check everytime you load it that it would be current and running properly.<br /><br />Two days ago I would have given this 5 stars, it's the first game I've gotten \\"addicted\\" to in a year. Today, I would give it zero, because it is so frustrating having worked so hard and get hooked only to have the game be experiencing a huge glitch.<br />>:(

145210655X|5.0|I picked up this book on a recent trip to New York. I bought it for my son who's a 7-year old Star Wars fan with a budding sense of humor, but the jokes are a little beyond him. I think it would be better suited for a Star Wars-loving dad. The humor reminds me of The Far Side comics, which I've always loved.
006197806X|5.0|Phew. Lauren Oliver really had her work cut out for her in this follow-up to, Delirium. Not only do we see Lana's character grow immensely and really come into her own, but we also see the introduction of an almost entirely new cast of characters.<br /><br />There are so many things that I would love to go into about Alex, Julian, and Lana's mom...but that would be giving away just too many potential spoilers; and it would totally ruin the experience for anyone about to read the book.<br /><br />The book is written in Lana's present reality, but it also flashes back to scenes from her past. Take your time reading this book as it follows Lana from \\"Now\\" (as a member of the Resistance in NY) to \\"Then\\" (as she rediscovers who she really is in the Wilds). Lauren Oliver packed a lot of punch in this book and, at times, you can almost feel the emotion rolling off of the pages like a thick fog. You will feel the weight pressed against your chest at times during this book because poor Lana is put to so many tests, both emotionally and physically.<br /><br />Let me just say that by the end of the book I was (literally) sitting on the edge of my bed, wide-eyed, and by the last words, I was cursing out loud (and, I will admit I wanted to smack Lauren Oliver - sorry Lauren, I love you!, but that was my first reaction) because the book was over and I cannot believe that Lauren Oliver expects us to sit and wait until February, 2013 for Requiem to come out so we can find out what happens next!!!!!

0061452068|4.0|Matt Ridley makes a mostly convincing case that the world is getting better. And he definitely makes some interesting arguments, for example pointing out how carbon-based fuels has eliminated druggery labor, perhaps even slavery. Though that point, like a bunch of them is suspect. And he ignores difficult questions when it suits him. For instance he pooh-poohs global warming, and doesn't look seriously as some disaster scenarios that are realistic and believed by very credible scientists. I wish he would have written the The Rational (Mostly) Optimist. In other words, he would have had more credibility if he wasn't so ideologically wedded to his thesis: all good ahead. True, he does add some caveats here and there, but they feel just like that and there is as noted some dishonesty and loose handling of facts. Still, if aware of that, a worthwhile read.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|I was fascinated reading this and couldn't put it down. I read this over two sittings, and then I wrote a follow up essay about why people should stop going into debt with liberal arts degrees because it's not a smart investment. We need better educational systems to keep us up to pace with the technology, and despite that dose of reality, the book is actually fairly optimistic on the future of employment and standards of living. It was a refreshing read backed with plenty of data and examples to support its theories.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Christian Bale not only plays the Bruce Wayne that Gotham sees him as, but he is also its greatest detective and justice breeder. Then there is also the \\"real\\" Bruce Wayne. A man of compassion, even though he is haunted daily by his past daily by the people he goes up against. Even though he wants to kill them, he knows that if he did he would be no better that someone like Ra's Al Ghul and his league of Assassins.<br />Aaron Eckhart also does a great job of playing multiple roles because he is so believable as the well mannered District Attorney and also as the psychotic killer that is Two-Face. Heath Ledger was a perfect Joker and I feel like it got the praise it warranted, but I feel all three leads deserved just as much recognition. This movie excels in every genre it approaches.Breathtaking on blu-ray.

B0077PBPJ6|3.0|England is at war, and Stephen Wraysford (Eddie Redmayne) is on the front lines. In command of a group of enterprising young men digging tunnels in order to get nearer foreign forces, Stephen spends most of his time above ground... until a superior officer (Matthew Goode) tells him to take to the tunnels. His timing could not be worse. Gunfire penetrates the underground shaft, leaving him badly wounded...<br /><br />But conscious to remember a much happier time... when he was employed at a textile factory in France. His employer is the wealthy, older Ren&eacute; Azaire but it is his lovely young wife Isabelle (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy) who most attracts Stephen's attention. Quiet and self-contained, she can often be heard weeping at night. Her stepdaughter is not much younger than she is, and is romantically interested in Stephen... but he has eyes only for the beautiful young woman who suffers so much in silence. As their affair unfolds and carries them both into desperate times, the audience travels back and forth between earlier simplicity and later turmoil during wartime. Many films employ this tactic but few accomplish it with as gentle of grace as Birdsong.<br /><br />Though I have not read the book, I understand that certain things, including the style of the narrative, have been changed. Fans debate heatedly over whether or not the cast is appropriate... I found them a lovely couple to watch with natural chemistry that sparks through lingering glances more than passionate love scenes. One could argue that some of these glances are too long, that eyes meeting over dinner or on the river with music dramatically swelling in the background can at times be a bit dull... and yes, it is true that it prolongs things considerably. The photography is glorious and the costuming exquisite. Too bad it misses the point of the novel, by making it seem as if they are in love. The book is about lust. The miniseries transforms it into forbidden love. There is a distinction between the two.<br /><br />From a purely entertainment perspective, the first episode is terrific, and the second is considerably less so, in part because the wartime scenes are tedious and the abrupt nature of how the relationship ends is emotionally unsatisfying (we learn later the reason for her flight, but there is little build-up). Much of the last hour is downright depressing as we watch his friends die in battle, some of them brutally. The first half of this story was solid but in the second half it stumbled and lost its way, most of the tension going right along with it. Stephen cannot carry the story on his own without Isabelle, and she is absent for the most part in the last hour and a half. It needed a stronger narrative style to go with its beautiful costumes and exquisite period setting. But perhaps the most troubling is that neither character learns anything from their misbehavior or feels remorse for their actions. For me, that left the story feeling empty since when stripped of any redeeming value or moral messages, any adulterous love affair just becomes a story of extreme selfishness.<br /><br />Parental Concerns: I presume this is the original, uncut British release that contains graphic sexual content (including oral), and nudity. Some war-related gore (including a man whose insides have been blown out). At least one f-word, a couple of abuses of Jesus' name, and scattered profanities.<br /><br />From a purely entertainment perspective, the first episode is terrific, and the second is considerably less so, in part because the wartime scenes are tedious and the abrupt nature of how the relationship ends is emotionally unsatisfying (we learn later the reason for her flight, but there is little build-up).

0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup promises to show you how to live a life of adventure, meaning and purpose -- and earn a good living. And it delivers.<br /><br />Chapters like \\"Give Them the Fish\\" and \\"An Offer You Can't Refuse\\" are written for first-time business owners. Yet, they also offer a gentle reminder to those of us who filed away our business planning exercises a year ago.<br /><br />The book is aspirational, while being specific and detailed on the steps any aspiring micro business owner should talk to set themselves up for success.<br /><br />It's important to note that the $100 Startup is based on more than Chris Guillebeaus's personal experience. I'm a fan of his, but I tend to get turned off when writers and bloggers assume that works for you is right for me. Chris successfully dodged that bullet by including 50 case studies in the book, which were culled from a group of 1,500. The strategies and tactics for building your business aren't good \\"because Chris says so,\\" they're proven by hundreds of success stories.<br /><br />Additionally, Chris is an excellent storyteller and writer. It's an added bonus that one doesn't often expect in a business book.<br /><br />I recommend The $100 Startup to people who are just starting their business, seeking a refresher or encouragement to jump-start new ideas, or secretly dreaming of starting your own business.<br /><br />For this last group, in particular, The $100 Startup is a must-have resource.  If you have a dream and think it's crazy impossible or out of your reach, drop your plans and start this book tonight.

B0053O89YM|5.0|I am delighted to report that Season 3 of my favorite network-TV drama is as consistently top notch across every episode as [[ASIN:B003FSTN52 Season 1]] and [[ASIN:B003L77G10 Season 2]].<br /><br />As Season 3 opens, Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) has emerged with greatly increased confidence in herself, both as a woman and as an attorney at Lockhart/Gardner, after the intense personal and professional struggles she endured during Season 2. She has left her husband Peter Florrick (Chris Noth) after finding out he had a one-night stand years ago with Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjaba), the firm's mysterious private investigator. In spite of the fact that Kalinda did not know Alicia then, this explosive revelation makes it impossible for Alicia to be anywhere near Kalinda without feeling an overwhelming urge to scream at her friend or burst into tears--which is a real problem since they have to work together on cases at Lockhart/Gardner.<br /><br />Kalinda, who normally is a really tough nut, is shown at the end of Season 2 visibly heartbroken over losing her friendship with Alicia, which was clearly one of the closest relationships she'd ever had. On the heels of what Alicia sees as a double betrayal, she has kicked Peter out of their apartment and dumped him and his possessions into an apartment she obtained for him without his prior knowledge. As apparent retaliation, Peter, who has just been re-elected to his old office as State's Attorney, strictly because of Alicia's high-profile loyalty and support during his campaign, has hired Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) to be his second-in-command. Cary has been Alicia's enemy since Season 1 when she beat him out for an associate position at Lockhart/Gardner.<br /><br />Alicia has begun talks with Lockhart/Gardner's barracuda divorce attorney, David Lee (the immensely talented Zach Grenier), and launched a torrid affair with Will Gardner (Josh Charles). For multiple reasons, Alicia and Will opt to keep their affair top secret: he is her boss, she is still legally married to Peter, and she doesn't want her kids to know about the affair.<br /><br />This show does a fantastic job this entire season, as it did the previous two seasons, delivering interesting cases for Lockhart/Gardner to represent. The series's excellent writers (led by award-winning, writer/producer, husband-and-wife team, Michelle and Robert King) keep these cases enthralling to viewers by offering spicy--and sometimes humorous--conflicts for the lawyers, such as client chicanery to be worked around, in-house rivalries threatening to torpedo the success of a given case, or mysteries for the ruthlessly capable Kalinda to solve in order to prove a client's innocence or win a case. In addition, whatever the overarching legal plot, it always deftly intertwines with several personal-relationship subplots every week. All of the main characters are linked to each other and numerous other subcharacters in an ever expanding web of secrets, lies and conniving. This could easily become confusing rather than pleasantly intriguing in less skillful hands than those of the show's writing team, but they never drop any plot threads, and never allow the show to slide into outright soapiness, a failing that seems to afflict the vast majority of nighttime drama.<br /><br />The acting continues to be terrific. I concur 100% with the Emmy wins of Julianna Margulies for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Archie Panjabi for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and the nominations of Josh Charles as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and Christine Baranski, as Diane Lockhart, for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.<br /><br />Though Matt Czuchry has not yet been nominated for an Emmy for this show, he contributes greatly to its success by his capable handling of his recurring role as ambitious attorney, Cary Agos. I quite enjoyed the growth arc of his relationship with Alicia this season. Czuchry's outstanding ability to portray Cary's intense emotions through subtle facial expressions--in keeping with the poker face that men in general employ, and lawyers especially are forced to cultivate--never fails to entertain.<br /><br />Mary Beth Peil as Jackie Florrick continues her excellent work as the ambitious mother of Alicia's husband, Peter, and Peter also gets a lot of stage time this season as he contemplates a run for the governor's office. This goal is made all the more fascinating because it is impossible to achieve without the cooperation of both Alicia and cagey political operative, Eli Gold.<br /><br />Eli is one of my favorites on a show overflowing with talented actors playing plum parts. Alan Cumming's portrayal of Eli is filled with delightful contradiction. Just when Eli's ruthlessness is about to push him over the edge into the territory of unsympathetic, irredeemable jerk, out peeks a soft-heartedness that is often quite funny to behold. After Season 1, Cumming received an Emmy nomination as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Apparently because his work was so exceptional that year, he was promoted to a recurring role, and for Season 2, he received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the caliber of the many actors with recurring guest roles, but two in particular deserve special attention: Michael J. Fox received his 12th Emmy nomination for his portrayal of attorney Louis Canning, who cynically attempts to gin up sympathy from judges and juries for his Parkinson-type symptoms in order to win his cases. Martha Plimpton (Emmy winner as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for [[ASIN:B003UD7JDA Raising Hope]]) plays cutthroat attorney Patti Nyholm who, like Louis Canning, uses a physical health condition--in her case pregnancy and later the baby that resulted from that pregnancy--to deceive and manipulate her opponents.<br /><br />If you haven't been watching this show every week, or even if you have, this DVD is a worthwhile investment in some of the best TV drama of this season or any other.s outstanding ability to portray Cary's intense emotions through subtle facial expressions--in keeping with the poker face that men in general employ, and lawyers especially are forced to cultivate--never fails to entertain.<br /><br />Mary Beth Peil as Jackie Florrick continues her excellent work as the ambitious mother of Alicia's husband, Peter, and Peter also gets a lot of stage time this season as he contemplates a run for the governor's office. This goal is made all the more fascinating because it is impossible to achieve without the cooperation of both Alicia and cagey political operative, Eli Gold.<br /><br />Eli is one of my favorites on a show overflowing with talented actors playing plum parts. Alan Cumming's portrayal of Eli is filled with delightful contradiction. Just when Eli's ruthlessness is about to push him over the edge into the territory of unsympathetic, irredeemable jerk, out peeks a soft-heartedness that is often quite funny to behold. After Season 1, Cumming received an Emmy nomination as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Apparently because his work was so exceptional that year, he was promoted to a recurring role, and for Season 2, he received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the caliber of the many actors with recurring guest roles, but two in particular deserve special attention: Michael J. Fox received his 12th Emmy nomination for his portrayal of attorney Louis Canning, who cynically attempts to gin up sympathy from judges and juries for his Parkinson-type symptoms in order to win his cases. Martha Plimpton (Emmy winner as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for [[ASIN:B003UD7JDA Raising Hope]]) plays cutthroat attorney Patti Nyholm who, like Louis Canning, uses a physical health condition--in her case pregnancy and later the baby that resulted from that pregnancy--to deceive and manipulate her opponents.<br /><br />If you haven't been watching this show every week, or even if you have, this DVD is a worthwhile investment in some of the best TV drama of this season or any other.
0307951529|5.0|This book is inspirational, particularly because there are tons of examples of real people who have built their own businesses for very little money. Some of the other reviews say that it's a good book but a little impractical because they don't think most businesses can actually be started for so little. But Chris addresses that in the book: these businesses are built with very little cash upfront, but a huge investment of time. In almost any industry, if you're willing to put in the hours yourself, you don't need money for starting up. It means starting slower, but it also means that you can end up with a more sustainable business that will survive recessions and anything else that comes along.<br /><br />Yes, to reach the levels of success that the examples in this book have, you're going to have to work incredibly hard. But hard work isn't a bad thing.
030758836X|4.0|In the first few pages of Gillian Flynn's new novel Gone Girl, I was thinking, \\"This is it -- one of those rare novels that's unique and totally engrossing, cleverly plotted so that each new development has me astounded and eager to find out what happens next.\\"  Then the story continued as Midwestern husband Nick began to deal with his wife Amy's sudden disappearance and some gradually revealed details that might cast doubt on his own innocence in the matter.  During that time, the book dropped down from the level of extraordinary to merely somewhat intriguing.  However, once I reached Part Two of Gone Girl (\\"Boy Meets Girl\\"), it was like Ms Flynn kicked it up a notch, and the book became amazing again.  Without giving any spoilers, Part Two unveils some major plot twists that cast Amy's status in an entirely new light.  From that point on, the story moves along in powder keg fashion: the fuse has been lit, and it's only a question of how long 'til the explosion, and how much damage will be done when it happens.  Flynn has a distinctive writing style that really involved me in what was going on with her two main characters.  I had previously purchased but not yet read her Dark Places (after several recommendations).  Now I will have to read it, and also get her first book, Sharp Objects.  Only one warning, though: Gone Girl contains a fair amount of foul language.  This was not a problem for me, but it might be for some readers.

B006WB7IN8|5.0|I down-loaded this book with no great expectations (when, oh when will professional reviewers take on ebooks) but, from the very beginning, I was bowled over by the skill of the author.  The handling of two different time-lines is deftly done with the suspense separately building in each adding to the other.  Haynes's insight into OCD is extraordinary as is her knowledge of power relationships between men and women.  I recommend this page-turner (or screen-changer on Kindle, I suppose) unreservedly.  It's difficult to believe it's a first novel.
1932100660|2.0|Here's a pretty good article discussing the book:  [...]  I've attached the author's summary/conclusion:    In summary and conclusion...    Apart from his cherry-picked references for other studies (some of which don't back up the claims he cites them for), Campbell's strongest arguments against animal foods hinge heavily on:      Associations between cholesterol and disease, and    His discoveries regarding casein and cancer.    For #1, it seems Campbell never took the critical step of accounting for other disease-causing variables that tend to cluster with higher-cholesterol counties in the China Study--variables like schistosomiasis infection, industrial work hazards, increased hepatitis B infection, and other non-nutritional factors spurring chronic conditions. Areas with lower cholesterol, by contrast, tended to have fewer non-dietary risk factors, giving them an automatic advantage for preventing most cancers and heart disease. (The health threats in the lower-cholesterol areas were more related to poor living conditions, leading to greater rates of tuberculosis, pneumonia, intestinal obstruction, and so forth.)    Even if the correlations with cholesterol did remain after adjusting for these risk factors, it takes a profound leap in logic to link animal products with disease by way of blood cholesterol when the animal products themselves don't correlate with those diseases. If all three of these variables rose in unison, then hypotheses about animal foods raising disease risk via cholesterol could be justified. Yet the China Study data speaks for itself: Animal protein doesn't correspond with more disease, even in the highest animal food-eating counties--such as Tuoli, whose citizens chow down on 134 grams of animal protein per day.    Nor is the link between animal food consumption and cholesterol levels always as strong as Campbell implies. For instance, despite eating such massive amounts of animal foods, Tuoli county had the same average cholesterol levelas the near-vegan Shanyang county, and a had a slightly lower cholesterol than another near-vegan county called Taixing. (Both Shanyang and Taixing consumed less than 1 gram of animal protein per day, on average.) Clearly, the relationship between animal food consumption and blood cholesterol isn't always linear, and other factors play a role in raising or lowering levels.    For #2, Campbell's discoveries with casein and cancer, his work is no doubt revelatory. I give him props for dedicating so much of his life to a field of disease research that wasn't always well-received by the scientific community, and for pursuing so ardently the link between nutrition and health. Unfortunately, Campbell projects the results of his casein-cancer research onto all animal protein--a leap he does not justify with evidence or even sound logic.    As ample literature indicates, other forms of animal protein--particularly whey, another component of milk--may have strong anti-cancer properties. Some studies have examined the effect of whey and casein, side-by-side, on tumor growth and cancer, showing in nearly all cases that these two proteins have dramatically different effects on tumorigenesis (with whey being protective). A study Campbell helped conduct with one of his grad students in the 1980s showed that the cancer-promoting abilities of fish protein depended on what type of fat is consumed alongside it. The relationship between animal protein and cancer is obviously complex, situationally dependent, and bound with other substances found in animal foods--making it impossible extrapolate anything universal from a link between isolated casein and cancer.    On page 106 of his book, Campbell makes a statement I wholeheartedly agree with:    Everything in food works together to create health or disease. The more we think that a single chemical characterizes a whole food, the more we stray into idiocy.    It seems ironic that Campbell censures reductionism in nutritional science,yet uses that very reductionism to condemn an entire class of foods (animal products) based on the behavior of one substance in isolation (casein).    In sum, \\"The China Study\\" is a compelling collection of carefully chosen data. Unfortunately for both health seekers and the scientific community, Campbell appears to exclude relevant information when it indicts plant foods as causative of disease, or when it shows potential benefits for animal products. This presents readers with a strongly misleading interpretation of the original China Study data, as well as a slanted perspective of nutritional research from other arenas (including some that Campbell himself conducted).    In rebuttals to previous criticism on \\"The China Study,\\" Campbell seems to use his curriculum vitae as reason his word should be trusted above that of his critics. His education and experience is no doubt impressive, but the \\"Trust me, I'm a scientist\\" argument is a profoundly weak one. It doesn't require a PhD to be a critical thinker, nor does a laundry list of credentials prevent a person from falling victim to biased thinking. Ultimately, I believe Campbell was influenced by his own expectations about animal protein and disease, leading him to seek out specific correlations in the China Study data (and elsewhere) to confirm his predictions.    It's no surprise \\"The China Study\\" has been so widely embraced within the vegan and vegetarian community: It says point-blank what any vegan wants to hear--that there's scientific rationale for avoiding all animal foods. That even small amounts of animal protein are harmful. That an ethical ideal can be completely wed with health. These are exciting things to hear for anyone trying to justify a plant-only diet, and it's for this reason I believe \\"The China Study\\" has not received as much critical analysis as it deserves, especially from some of the great thinkers in the vegetarian world. Hopefully this critique has shed some light on the book's problemsand will lead others to examine the data for themselves.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i luved this book! i barely able 2 put it down 4 2 seconds without grabbing it back up and reading bits. sure, my mom yelled at me, but it wuz totes worth it! ;^)
B0076NAWWA|5.0|What a fresh recording. The songs are diverse, but the talent is consistent. I've had the CD for over a month now and still haven't taken it out of the CD player.
0307951529|5.0|I've been a fan of Chris Guillebeau's for a while. I'll be the first to say that I've lead an \\"unconventional\\" life. After my sophomore year in college, I dropped out to help my dad start a business and pursue my dream of playing professional soccer. This was back in 2008, around the start of the Recession. In hindsight, those weren't the most practical decisions but we made it work.<br /><br />Last year, we had $125,000 in revenue basically selling shirts and sweat shirts. We used a lot of what I read about in his other book, The Art of Non-Conformity, in setting up our business model. We only had 2 employees, little overhead, and ran everything from our computer in our family room with no degrees or previous business experience or connections.<br />That's basically what a micro business is; a business that is only 1-5 employees large and uses their passion as the basis of their business. I was beyond excited when I heard the $100 Start Up came out. I was able to get an uncorrected proof before its official release and it met my expectations.<br /><br />It takes common \\"myths\\" about business and trumps them. You don't need to spend millions, have tons of employees, and have an 80-page business plan to start a business. The book provides real-world examples of others who have started and grown a successful micro business. It also provides you with great resources such as the one-page business plan and how to come up with ideas.<br /><br />The $100 Start Up is written in easy to understand language and serves as a great platform of motivation to get started! In most instances, however, real business is not so simple to where you create a website and all of the sudden you make tons of sales the first day. The reader must keep in mind that while this is possible, most of the businesses showcased have been around for a while. That should not act as a deterrent, but rather as motivation to get started on your own micro business in your free time so that your micro business may eventually reach that stage to where you can quit your job and \\"reinvent the way you make a living, do what you love, and create a new future\\" as the book states.<br /><br />I am a micro business consultant and I've incorporated some of the lessons in the book into what I do. I recommend the book to anyone who has been yearning to start a business but doesn't know where to begin.
0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup is one of those great books that combines how-to without being vague--it uses specific examples, so that you aren't just getting someone's theoretical idea of how to start a business on a shoestring budget. You're getting real examples, from real people, across a wide variety of niches. I see the book as ultimately being about how you create the ultimate win-win in life--powerfully creating your own freedom through the work you do, while also being of service with the work that you do.<br /><br />I've been working for myself for the past six years, and I value this book because of the additional information that it gave me to refine my business edge and tighten any loose corners (and for sure, there were several that I ran across, even though I'm usually a \\"got all the bases covered\\" kind of gal), as well as the sense of camaraderie I feel as I read about the experiences that others have had--nodding my head, \\"Yeah, I get it, I know how that goes.\\"<br /><br />This is not for the VC-funded startup. This is for the trailblazer who wants to do it their own way, yet the smart way. Highly recommended!
0307463745|5.0|This book is short, easy to read and contains a lot of very valuable information. For me it confirmed certain things I have always had a problem with but which most of the people around me regard as \\"common sense\\" or just plain truth. For example the the chapter on failing being no way to learn really should be read by all those entrepreneurs who boast about having failed on numerous occasions. Whilst I dont personally feel that failure is shameful I also don't think it should be something to be aimed for or celebrated - something that a lot of entrepreneurs seem to forget. For anyone with a small company or business I would suggest that they definitely read this book. If you work for a larger company then the information still applies but you may want to see if you can apply it to teams or departments within the company first.
B004LWZW8I|1.0|This movie has to be one of the worst movies that I have seen in a long time.  I was so excited to pick this movie up, it lokoed awesome in the preview, and it was from the guys who did 300, so I figured how bad could it be? right? I was wrong!<br /><br />The plot is basically the story of Thesius and King Hyperion.  Hyperion is destroying all of Greece looking to capture the bow of the gods, and the gods refuse to intervene since they claim this is a human affair.<br /><br />Lets start with the plot.  The plot had so many plotholes in it and the movement of the story just simply went absolutely nowhere.  The movie and the story line were so unbelievably boring that I can not even express how bad it was.  The movie was portrayed to be a fast paced action movie and this was clearly not the case.  There was some fighting in the beginning, nothing too spectacular, a little bit of blood and a cut throat here or there, but that was about the extent of the fun.<br /><br />As the movie drags along you finally get a pretty good scene where Thesius fights a large berserker type soldier of Hyperions, ultimately it was nothing more than a mediocre fight scene that you could see in any movie.<br /><br />Finally the end of the movie and yet another supposidly epic fight scene gone terribly wrong.  It was so slow moving and boring, Thesius spending ten minutes running around looking for Hyperion, than a 20 mintute fight scene between  the two which was so slow and boring it was not even funny, it was like watching two old men beat each other with their walkers.<br /><br />Now that i've beat that horse to death, lets discuss the lighting... the lighting in this movie was awful.  All of the scenes were dark and muddy as hell, that even if I cared what was going on I would have no clue.<br /><br />Lastly, the gods... OMG, what a bunch of losers.  They made the god's these skinny little worthless invalids.  If you want a real laugh get look at Zeus, he looks like Marc Anthony withoutthe Cocaine.  Even the Titans look pathetic, they all look alike (even though they were brothers and parents of the gods), and they too are all pathetic looking.<br /><br />This movie was awful, it went nowhere the customes and designes were pathetic, the lighting was way off and worst of all it was boring as hell...<br /><br />Save the money.. dont do it!! Either Netflix it or rent it from the library, but definatey dont pay for it.

I noticed after the first month that I purchased it that it was not working as it did when I first bought it. Today, May 8th I plugged the cord into my computer and the whole top part of the device that plugs into my computer completely broke off. For spending $35 on this I expected way more out of it. It is literally a piece of crap and do not recommend it to anyone! Do not waste your time and money on something that will only work for less than three months. I am PISSED to say the least and WILL NOT be buying anything from this company ever again and will not recommend any of these products to anyone.

I've got some news for you...Black Sabbath is done, over, no more--which sucks, but is nonetheless the truth. So why not let some fresh new band come out and take the ball and run with it? Orchid do that and then some. At the same time, calling them Black Sabbath Part 2 isn't fair either. This album kicks so much a$$ it isn't believable--and Orchid's talent is undeniable. They not only take Sabbath's essence, but breath new life into Doom/Stoner metal and MAN-O-MAN are their songs catchy! Powerful riffs, killer vocals and huge choruses that will stick with you. Black Sabbath is my favorite band of all time, and now Orchid is my favorite new band...the circle continues.

B007FOH7UU|3.0|Definitely a return to the piano-focused sound of Hope & Fears, but more upbeat and light.  There are a number of standouts, though nothing as engaging as the title track from Perfect Symmetry or A Bad Dream.  This is a polished, mature pop album that doesn't break new ground, but I'm guessing manyKeane fans will be grateful for that.  Almost every song clocks in under 4 minutes and there is an absence of sophistication, but that doesn't mean the songs aren't fun.  It's worth the purchase and a quality effort, but don't expect it to change your world. Enjoy it for what it is; don't bemoan what it doesn't aspire to be.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Let me preface this review by stating that, though I am an avid romance-novel reader, this is my first \\"BDSM novel\\" so my opinion may have to be taken with a proverbial grain of salt.  I initially had no interest in reading \\"Fifty Shades,\\" but after all the media hype my curiosity got the better of me.  My feelings about this book can be summed up in a few words:  \\"It was okay.\\"<br /><br />Anastasia Steele, a shy college virgin, is romanced by billionaire Christian Grey after the two have a chance meeting.  Following is a whirlwind romance in which the mutual attraction between the two is palpable.  However, Ana soon finds out there is a dark side to Christian.  Though Ana is still attracted to him (while struggling with his dominant, controlling personality) she is still afraid of being hurt, both physically and emotionally.  Most of the novel details the passionate romance and the back and forth compromises between the two with Ana compromising her comfort level with the unconventional relationship and Christian compromising his typical unattached, non-commitment, \\"Dom\\" nature to keep Ana from leaving him.  FYI:  (though you are probably already aware) this book is part one of a trilogy, so there is quite a cliff-hanger at the end of the novel.<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"Fifty Shades\\" had a pretty even ratio of positive to negative aspects.  First of all, I could not get on board with Christian as the hero.  I know E.L James tried to weave redeeming qualities into his character to make up for the fact that he was \\"fifty shades of ******-up,\\" but I felt those qualities contrived since so much time is spent detailing how messed up and controlling he is.  Though Ana was undeniably attracted to him, she was afraid of him.  I did not find his controlling nature flattering; it was a red flag.  Also, this book had little semblance of realism for obvious reasons (27-year-old Dom billionaire seducing a shy college virgin perhaps?).  I also think a lot of girls would RUN after seeing the \\"Red Room of Pain,\\" especially if they were never-been-kissed virgins like Ana.  That being said, how many of us read these novels wanting realism?  Not I.  If this novel were real Christian would probably not exist and if he did, he would be in his fifties, balding, and at least 50 lbs overweight.  Ana also would probably not be the shy virgin that Christian was intially attracted to and the book would be ten pages long, ending after their \\"meet cute.\\"<br /><br />Anyways!  Though I did not like Christian (and spent the whole novel cheering for Ana when she would snap back at him and put him in his place), Ana was a character I felt I could root for.  She was witty and throughout the story began to assert herself, which I found refreshing given Christian's unreasonably controlling personality.  Then in the end, (without spoiling anything) she has a climactic moment of self-assertiveness which I actually fist-pumped after reading.  I give the book 3/5 because though I think it had flaws, it was a good story at the core. I've read better, but also have read much worse.  If you like traditional romance novels with \\"vanilla\\" sex, this may not be the book for you.  However, if you are curious (like I was), you might enjoy it because for as much as the media hyped it, there are very few \\"BDSM\\" sex scenes in comparison to how many \\"typical\\" sex scenes there are.  I say give it a try, if for no other reason than being able to say, \\"'Fifty Shades of Grey'?  The book everyone was so excited about?  Yeah, I read it,\\" and smile inwardly because you have a secret bond you can share with the thousands of others who have read and enjoyed this book.

The tickets were my birthday present from my son and stepson-because they knew how much we both loved Sade's music. I've been her fan since the 80's. This concert was a wonderful experience! Sade's extraordinary voice and beautiful presence, backed up by her fabulous band, and unbelievable lighting and visual effects, made for one of the best concerts I have ever seen! Sade performed her exciting new \\"Soldier Of Love\\", and most of her unforgettable classics with great style..bringing back sweet memories-because her songs are the soundtrack of many of our lives. THIS YEAR, THIS DVD WILL BE MY NEW BIRTHDAY PRESENT! IT IS A MUST-SEE FOR ALL SADE LOVERS AND EVERYONE! DON'T MISS IT!

B00006I53S|1.0|After reading some of the past reviews I felt compelled to write my own to help stop someone from thinking it is a good product. They are all very correct about the fact that this is a hobbyist lens, which is very true. But I'd like to point out that this is by no means a pro lens. It is not built for the stress of every day commercial use or being changed out or toggled at a wedding shoot and the likes. If you are an aspiring  photographer looking to save a few dollars by purchasing this lens please reconsider.<br /><br />The build quality is almost all soft plastic and unlike the 50mm 1.8 this one easily comes loose allowing one of it's internal metal components to fall into the glass. It happened to mine within 2 months of use and as I researched how to fix it the same problem came across again and again... Another major drawback is it's lens creep, the lens extends to full zoom whenever it faces down. This may not seem like a huge problem, but like any object subject to constant friction the ware will eventually cause damage. Finally, it's decent focal range also dulled by it's over all lack of sharpness and contrast at any stop.<br /><br />My opinion, do not get this lens. Saving up another 400 will get you a lens that will not only do a better job on image quality but will work for years to come and still hold it's resell value. This lens goes for around $75.00 in the real world resell markets, and that's if it works..
0307951529|5.0|Chris Guillebeau's new book tears away at the fabric of procrastination to all those who have wanted to do something on the side but never thought they could. Sure, some people can say, \\"It costs more than $100 to start a business.\\" If you want to get stuck on that, go ahead! But what Chris provides are umpteen real life stories, checklists, and how-to's describing the ins and outs to starting a successful business.<br /><br />You're always going to need drive and a sell-able idea, but long gone are the days when you necessarily need investors, loans, a hope and a dream.<br /><br />Chris's book is a gem for all those wondering how to start, those spinning their tires, or those thinking that having a business on the side (or a full fledged entrepreneurial venture) was impossible. It's digestible and easy to understand, but CAUTION: Once you read the book, you won't have any more excuses for not starting!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my 5yr old love this app as we play the gsmes to reavh next game. different games means u never get bored.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love the game but my complaint is that at level 23 the game froze it just would not allow me to get coins or food I ended up deleting it
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is perfect at first I was wishing it would be in the kindle fire and it is and its great I play it all the time so everyone get it!!!:)
0307951529|4.0|This is a very inspiring book with tons of research. I think what sets this book apart compared to others in similar category is that it emphasizes hardwork, patience, and that it takes some time for \\"over-night\\" success. It also empahsizes that you have to have an idea of value that others are willing to pay for! I recommend it and found it very inspiring.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|This lame movie is annoying on many levels. First, the dialogue consists of everyone yelling their lame lines twice, as in, \\"Move! move.\\" \\"Let's go! Let's go!\\" \\"Look out! Look out!\\" After awhile, I started laughing every time the actors had to do this, which is often.<br />Second, the soundtrack is incredibly annoying and manipulative. It consists of orchestral violins either trying to create suspense, drum up patriotic fervor or announce that the aliens are winning and the Marines are on the ropes.<br />Third, the CGI never really lets you see anything for very long to discover how fake it really is.<br />Fourth, this is a military recruiting poster brought to life, only the actors look kind of hokey in their helmets.<br />Fifth, it hits every emotional button the filmmakers could think of, from frequent shots of cute but terrified little kids, to death scenes of Marines while patriotic music swells up. Icky poo poo.<br />They shot this in Louisiana, not LA, which is kind of funny, somehow.<br />Watch, but don't expect much. You've seen this war-of-the-worlds schtick before, only done way better.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|Could you please do a free version that isn't very lite like other developers?  You hardly get any play time.
0345803485|2.0|This book isn't that great. I also don't understand why this man would go after this self proclaimed boring, unexperienced, shy, lackluster character. Some of the erotica scenes did some stuff to me, but I don't ever read this kind of material, so I'm not surprised that it did. Outside of that, the story was BO-RING!<br /><br />Out of sheer curiosity, I might read on just to see where these characters go.
0345803485|1.0|Is it just me..or does the idea of a college graduate who is completely clueless about technology (ooo! email!)and also a virgin who has never experimented AT ALL (but is so attractive that all the men around her fall at her feet and ask her out again and again), and her \\"friend\\"-- a mega zillionaire bachelor not yet in to his 30s (who has had time to not only amass a major fortune but also have relationships with over a dozen women...when does he sleep?) strike anyone else as completely ridiculous?  I know its fiction...and its akin to the flimsy set-ups from the old days of porno movies (its the pizza delivery boy!)-- but a tad more realistic characters might have made this book midly tolerable.  The writing was so bad, it makes me a bit queasy when I think of all the talented authors out there while this drivel tops the best seller list (and yes, I hang my head in shame for purchasing this on my Kindle).
B0067TGSOK|5.0|\\"The $100 Startup\\" is not the book for people who are content to sit around and think about their dreams, but is for people who are actively looking to get up and do something about it.  If you're long-time readers of the blog, you know that it's all about hustle-hustle-hustle, and the book has a whole chapter (Chapter 9) on hustling, or as Chris defines it: \\"building interest and attracting attention.\\"<br /><br />Filled with case studies of others entrepreneurs who all make at least $50k a year from their small businesses, this book gives you the blueprint to start your own little company based on something you love.  The first part of the book examines the lean and mean $100 startup business model, and also leads you through how and why you might want to start up your own (side) business.<br /><br />The second part of the book talks about the basics behind launching a product, marketing, getting your stuff out there, unconventional fundraising, and one-page business plans.  Lots of good stuff here to get you up and running.<br /><br />The third section of the book is about expanding (or choosing not to), leveraging your existing resources, and talks about what to think about for the long haul.  Throughout all the sections, Chris intersperses advice with the case studies I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />While I wish there was a bit more specific advice and less storytelling, I do realize that specific advice for me doesn't apply to everyone, and vice versa.  Chris did the best job of straddling that fine line between sharing what worked for others and what might work for you.  Also, as someone who has read a lot of online marketing material and bought courses, this book didn't offer many mid-tier/higher level advice, but then again, that's not who this is for.<br /><br />This book is for people who haven't taken that first step towards becoming entrepreneurs, and want to learn more about the process before they dive right in.  I think this would also be great for any college-age students who are getting a bit disenchanted with the job market out there right now.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know I should have probably read the reviews before I purchased this product, but was browsing on my kindle. It came with high reviews and was recommended on the front page so I just downloaded the sample on a whim. The first chapter and a half seemed so innocent and almost seemed like a mystery novel more than anything. So I dropped $10 on it to finish it out.<br /><br />Little did I know this turned out to be a \\"erotic\\" novel. It isn't even classy. It's just sex. Every 5 pages. Sorry, but if I really wanted to read porn, I could read it for free on the internet. Why would I drop $10 on a book? There really isn't ANY disclaimer anywhere stating that it's an erotic novel. I'd love to get my money back and they can erase it from my kindle forever..
B002SJIO5E|1.0|The worst movie I have ever purchased. I can't even imagine how it got 3.5 stars! I bought it when it came out and will never watch it again. I should just throw it out
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It could get a bit cheesy but that was another reason I enjoyed it so. I read all 3 books in 3 weeks. The first one in 4 days, I couldn't put it down!!! Really enjoyed them.
B005OHSUQK|5.0|SOA never ceases to amaze me, it's like no other regular tv show. I viewed all 4 seasons on Netflix everyday until i reached the end. My nights were catered around SOA. Everything that happened on the show was unexpected. Katie Sagall performed very well, not playing her usual roles. It was interesting to see her part unfold. And the son, is so cock-diesel. I love his part. He could be mean, but sympathetic without revealing what he knows. I cant wait for the next season. And why does it take so long for the next season to start? I wish the seasons were also longer. either way, ill be ready when they start up again. I cant say any show was dull. Keep them coming, like no other. Im HOOKED!!!!!!!
1609613937|5.0|While I watched the news tonight they said that our country's obesity rate is now at 35% and is expected to reach 42% in the near future.  The Starch Solution is THE solution for our nation's obesity epidemic, as well as for many other preventable diseases like heart disease and Type II diabetes.  Dr. McDougall proves that the cure for all of these diseases is at the end of our fork, while Mary makes \\"the cure\\" taste delicious.  Be sure you try the Thai Noodles as you eat your way back to health!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|No way is this top chart material. I felt sick reading parts until I finally just deleted it. I'm no prude and love scenes can be really exciting, but I was not expecting contracts to torture his lover and the sick ways he does things. What a turn off. I feel like my brain needs a bath.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is one of the best games I have ever played so far. if there is a better game it would be awesome
B004P1JDJO|4.0|I got this book not knowing what to expect exactly. My degree is in Sociology and I work with people, so I really enjoy learning about what makes us tick. This book opened up a world about why we do the things we do that had not been fully expressed in other mainstream literature about motivation that I have read. What I found most interesting is how we are capable of amazing things with the right environment. one that allows for intrinsic motivation to take hold. Also, what I found interesting is how far behind many of our businesses and organizations are in promoting these environments. A great and easy to follow book!
0345803485|5.0|I bought the first of the 3 on a Friday nite.  I was hooked from page one.  It kept me turning pages until I finished with book 3 on Monday evening.  Wonderful!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The game is so awesome and entertaining that I could play it through one-hundred times and NEVER get bored with it! Especially since POLAR BEARS keep on running around people in my town; but not hurting them, of-course. Although,........., I DO keep-on wondering where POLAR BEARS keep-on coming from...........

B001DE29SS|5.0|This is an excellent presentation of the Chaplin Story.  Downey does an outstanding job portraying the great silent comic.  The story also covers the very biased attacks on him by J. Edgar Hoover, and his final recognition by the modern movie industry as a classic performer.
0307951529|5.0|Author Chris Guillebeau has written a book, \\"The $100 Startup,\\" that should fly off the shelves. Endorsed by such legendary entrepreneurs as Seth Godin, \\"The Bootstrapper's Bible\\"; Tony Hsieh, Zappos.com; John Jantsch, \\"Duct Tape Marketing\\"; and Erin Doland, \\"Unclutter Your Life in One Week,\\" \\"The $100 Startup\\" will surely find a welcome spot in your business and entrpreneurial library.<br /><br />Whenever I first come across one of these \\"business\\" books, I take a cruise through and see how it might relate to me and my passion of photography. As it happens, Guillebeau has a few great references to photography here, as well as a good deal of other business ideas and suggestions, along with a tremendous amount of real-life examples.<br /><br />I simply can't say enough about this book and have already recommended to many of my friends. I even recently featured it on my blog, RedDogNews.com. Many relevant examples lead you through many a process that will definitely serve to awaken the entrepreneurial spirit in many of its readers.<br /><br />Rowse began blogging in 2002, and turned writing for several of his personal blogs, including Digital Photography School, into a full-time occupation making six-figures. Throughout \\"The $100 Startup\\" there are dozens of examples of people who started with next to nothing to build their own life-enhancing careers. When you get his \\"must-have\\" read, be sure to read about the mattress man!<br /><br />\\"It's all about finding the intersection between your expertise--even if you don't consider it such-- and what other people will pay for,\\" Guillebeau writes on the cover flap. \\"You don't need an MBA, a business plan, or even employees. All you need is a product or service that springs from what you love to do anyway, people willing to pay, and a way to get paid.\\"<br /><br />Most of the pages of my book are already dog-eared and crumpled from reading certain sections over and over. There is much to be learned from this book, no matter your career or side-business pursuits.ur career or side-business pursuits.
B000IROQNW|5.0|This is an outstanding novel by James Clavell, following an English sailor tossed up on the Japanese shore, and his adaptation to the style and politics of Japan.  It goes through the competition of at least two major leaders for the critical position of Shogun, or national chief, as they manipulate others to achieve superiority.  It is also a love story between the Englishman and a high born Japanese lady.  To follow the whole story one must read both volumes (the hardcover edition is too long for a single volume).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really fun game. it's annoying that it requires you to play games you don't really want to playto unlock games you do but otherwise it's fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game, it is very addicting....sometimes waiting for the babies to hatch seems to take forever since the Red Sloths take 11hrs. or so to hatch, but after you finish a family it is very rewarding. The inside games are lots of fun too, along with watching little Scrat clips in the movie theater.<br />I would definitly recommend buying this game.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I got Grizly Manor and then I got this wonderful game.  I love this but it was much harder than the other game. I did have to cheat a bit but I love that it kept me entertained and for the price you can not ask for more.  I loved these click and finds adventures.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|REALLY FUN AND ADDICITVE my 3 year old was playing and having a ball.. I woke up in the middle of the night just to play.. REALLY COOL GAME

0743454537|5.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult novel, and now I'm an eternal fan. The writing was simply poetic. I've never read an author that had such a beautiful and imaginative way with words. The story was emotional and interesting throughout the book. Each chapter was written in first person from the POV of a different character so it was great being in everyone's head. I did see where it was going many times, but it didn't matter in this case. Highly recommended.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Needs a major update. Time and time again things reset to an unrealistic amount of time or you can no longer click on it.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I loved the movie. I thought it was fast paced, endearing and comedic at times. My dad was always a Trek fan, and I can see why. Having to look at Zachary Quinto for 2 hours isn't bad either :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The third book in the Fifty Shades trilogy is nothing short of astounding. A more perfect ending could not have been written. E L James most certainly knows how to write an amazing - and sexy - love story. This last book leaves you wanting to read all three over and over again; I couldn't get the story out of my mind for weeks! If Christian Grey was a real man, he definitely would be the sexiest man alive.
0345803485|1.0|Thought this was going to be a love story, ordered all three from Amazon.  Turned out to be pure porn.  Returned the last 2 books and gave the first away for someone to ebay.  Not at all what I was expecting.  I never finished the first book called Shades of Grey.<br /><br />Keep your money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty fun Butt confusing It is hats becauuse it dose not explain how to play besides that itbis really sweet
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|I'm just received the item (Iron Maiden: En Vivo Blu Ray) and watched it several time. All I want to say is it's awesome. Thank amazon for the great item and  of course I love to purchase other item from amazon.
0307951529|5.0|This book really got me to thinking about my place in the universe and that I can reasonably accomplish more than I previously thought.  The first part is about inspiration: something to the effect of 'you don't have to live your life the way other people expect you to'.  The middle part is all about getting started (which is perfect for me).  The last part is about constant refinement and improvement.
B007ZTN07O|4.0|great graphics! plays like its arcade perfect! controls take a while to get used too but otherwise great port, well worth the price.
B007PS0X0W|5.0|With a lot of negative reviews out there on this movie I wasn't sure if I wanted to see own it or even view it. The write-ups talked about the adding of a child similar to the Twilight series, which I thought not sure what that would do to this movie. However, after venturing out to see it, I can say it's a great movie and you will look forward to the next one. It really was action packed in the one hour and thirty minutes on. I'm glad I added it to my collection and I say it's certainly worth a watch and purchase.
B007CKNX28|4.0|In a way that many described Paul McCartney's first solo album as very \\"Paul,\\" this debut solo album by Jack White is  indeed very \\"Jack.\\" All the things you associate with the man are found here, almost to an exaggerated point. You'll find heavy songs, rockabilly songs, country songs, and songs that sound like they were written in the 1930's. It's a whole lot of fun, and reminds you why Jack is such a profound icon in the music business.<br /><br />That being said, this is a rather laid back approach towards a debut solo record (again, kind of how McCartney's was viewed). After finally putting his White Stripes behind him, this was the album where the world was waiting to see what he'd do on his own. Turns out, he didn't try to blow anyone away or meet any expectations. If you're expecting a new sound or anything revolutionary here, you're going to be let down. This is simply another album by Jack White, writing the same kind of songs he always has for his three bands, and doing it wonderfully. The album does indeed have a vibe all its own, but this is Jack White music through and through...and that is a wonderful thing.<br /><br />This isn't the best album the guy has ever put out, but that really, really doesn't matter. It's a great album that really proves that things are going to be just fine, even without The White Stripes.<br /><br />If you follow Jack's career as much as I do, you know how much a musical legacy he's build. His own record label, signing new artists, creating new formats of vinyl, innovative promotions, Co-fronting the Raconteurs, drumming in the Dead Weather, producing and getting involved with classic artists...he's done more than some of the \\"greats\\" and he's only in his mid-30's. Among all this hard work and all these projects, Jack has given us a solo album. Something to say \\"hey, it's still me behind all this. The same me that you met on the first White Stipes record.\\" What a brilliant reminder it is. We're lucky to live in the generation where Jack White is an active musician. Fifty years from now, our grandchildren will be envious we had the chance to see him live.
B006JD48NM|5.0|We had seen the movie in the theatres and waited for the release on DVD.  Film is interesting, even for those unfamiliar with the sport of Formula 1.  Ayerton Senna was an interesting person, somewhat larger than life in ways.  The film does a good job of documenting his career in F1
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I made a quick buy based on amazon's recommendation.  I read the first chapter and right up to where the heroine signed the non-disclosure agreement.  It was weird so I checked out some critic's reviews.  I couldn't believe that women have struggled, been imprisoned and actually died for empowerment since the 1840's and now consider this \\"good\\"!  The lead character is not a heroine, she is a victim.  And she chooses to be one.  E[...]  I dumped it off my kindle.  I will never trust Amazon enough to do a 'quick buy' again. My mistake.

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Dear John is definitely Nicholas Sparks! Filled with tears and love, this is the story of a soldier during 9/11 and the War on Terrorism. Separated and communicating by letters, his love and he keep in touch and promise to be together after his contract. Then, 9/11 comes, and patriotism runs high...<br />I cried and cried and cried. Then I cried some more. I laughed some, and loved some. This story is for somebody looking for sorrow and love, with a broken heart, or having lost a loved one. The ending is not the happiest in the world. If you want to end on a better note with some tears along the way, like The Last Song, don't get this, but this story could easily happen to any enlisted serviceman or loving young woman.
B007V9YF5E|4.0|Great action flick, Gina put in a good performance and I look forward to seeing more from her. If your looking for a deep mystery or complicated characters pass on this one but if you liked Die Hard, you should enjoy this.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Downloaded the book because of the rave reviews on the film. Really enjoyed the book, captures your imagination from the start. Then went on to see to film, don't bother, as usual, director decides what best for the public, not!<br />Lack of imagination, Buffy without the vampires, shame, would have added a bit of spice. Read the book forget the film.

1609613937|5.0|When a fit and trim, windsurfing grandpa' of 65 wants to give me some advice on being healthy, I'm all ears!<br /><br />The fact that he's a highly respected physician with a mesmerizing history and a courageous and daring education (medical and otherwise) is just too much to pass up.<br /><br />Alas, the SAD diet (Standard American Diet) of his youth nearly killed him as a teenager (literally). Suffice to say, he then went thru Medical School with a VERY unique perspective.  Eyes and ears and mind open all the way and never afraid to challenge the status quo, he sought - again and again and again - comprehension and simple, accurate answers to straightforward questions about his own health - and that of his patients.<br /><br />Dr. McDougall is a genius.  What he's discovered along the way will captivate you.  It will change your life, as it's changed his own and the lives of thousands lucky enough to call him 'Doctor'.<br /><br />(today, thru this books, videos, DVD's, youtube and his website, MILLIONS are following his worthy advice)<br /><br />Hope he gets to be our next Surgeon General!
0345803485|4.0|I really liked the first half of this book. Christian seems a compelling main character, one to which many readers would initially feel drawn. He is smart, confident, successful, handsome...the list goes on. Ana's innocence and quiet intelligence make her stand apart from the rest, and I could see how two such people would create sparks. Here, I think, is where the author is at her best - building up the attraction between these two. However, the second half of this book is just too difficult to believe - on many levels. What 21 year old virgin wouldn't run for the hills seeing Christian's Red Room of Pain? Perhaps some worldly, experienced, and jaded person, but not a naive 21 year old college student. Also, the sex is just too often and overdone. Who really carries on like that? I'm surprised Christian is able to manage the weighty responsibilities of running a multi-million dollar corporation with all the time he spends carrying on with Ana. I also have this nagging feeling that Ana is a victim in this book - Christian is spanking and flogging her (she doesn't like these \\"punishments\\"), but she endures it b/c she wants to be loved. This bothers me b/c the author is not aiming to depict Ana as a victim. I get the sense that James wants to create a character who can hold her own...<br /><br />I did enjoy this book, though, and will probably read the two sequels but not consecutively...there's only so much bedroom antics I can handle.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|I enjoyed this thoroughly.  The kindle edition made it easy to back-search when a name was mentioned (a paperback would also be ok for this I guess...quick flipping of pages).  Lots of names and characters to keep track of, but the essential interesting thing is laid out in the introduction...the essential \\"puzzle\\" of double agent operations.  A neat concept, and there are enough mundane tidbits (because the author spent a short time as an agent) that make it feel very authentic.  Really a neat book, and worth a read if you are at all inclined or curious about the author's work...
B004EPZ070|4.0|The only good thing about this movie is Colin Egglesfield - he's the reason I'm watching it, he's the reason I'm buyin it. Good lord, put this man in more movies - he's easy on the eyes and a good actor! Hoping he plays Christian Grey next..

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read the first book within 48 hours...Couldn't put it down I was so engrossed. I was so looking forward to dive into the 2nd and get some answers on Christians haunting past, but I am over half way thru and it's lacking. There's not alot of content and every time Ana and Christian have a serious moment it's pushed aside for yet another intimate moment. I'm tired of reading the intimate moments over and over again. I will finish reading the book with hopes of some additional content and answers to why Christian is the way he is. To sum it up, this book as lost that \\"I can't wait to get home and read another chapter\\" luster. Disappointing, I hope to read a review of what's to come in the third book so I don't have to read it as well.<br />Also I do not like that I am unable to share this ebook with other kindle users. (I use the kindle cloud app on my iPad 2, iPhone and PC.) I believe all books should be share-able within a certain means, just as a paper copy is. I paid the same price!!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I like Tom Cruise as an actor, even though he had a strange meltdown and is part of a cult. The movie had its moments but I'm getting tired of the terrorism narrative. I'd watch it again but the reviewers who say this was the best or one of the best Mission Impossible movies I have to laugh at.
B000002OZY|4.0|BEWARE! Amazon shares product reviews for the recording across all formats (CD, Vinyl, download, SACD). You will see several reviewers talk about how good the SACD is, and it may well be, but those reviews are not applicable to non-SACD formats.<br /><br />I was careless and ended up purchasing the 1996 remaster thinking it was or included the SACD. It of course was not the multi-channel SACD I was hoping to get when I read the reviews. My own fault, just hoping to save a few others from making the same mistake.<br /><br />Amazon, this needs to be addressed. Reviews are speaking not only to the quality of the music but also the packaging, remastering and other attributes that just are not pertinent to all editions/formats. You get the track listings correct for each format, can we not have at least a filter to see only reviews for the selected format?
0060594888|5.0|Simply put this book is a Game-changer.. if you apply it. Broken down in easy-to comprehend sections from determining your goals and visions, to mapping out game plans, and keys to persistence and motivation. Many great examples.. i have re-read and referenced this book numerous times. Great for anyone that feels that they haven't found their passion or bliss.. Would have been nice to read this at even an earlier point in my life. I have purchased copies for friends and family that could use a boost! Anyone and everyone can relate and reap the benefits of this great inspiration.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a great book.  The characters were well developed and entertainingly quirky.  The sense of place was wonderful.  It was not a predictable plot.  I found it thoroughly entertaining and touching.  I lost myself in the story.  Loved it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am an avid reader that looks constantly for something new and exciting to read.  No matter how good the book is I am always ready to move on to the next one.  HOWEVER, I wanted this book to go on forever and I don't know what I amgoing to do when I have finished the third book.  I have read thousands of books and this is by far the ULTIMATE read of my life.  Nothing can ever compare to the writing of this author.<br />She has amazing talent.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|no question that midnight in paris deserved the oscar for best screenplay.  the first time i watched it, i thought it was good, not great.  but then i watched it again, and fell in love with it.  the third time was even better and i plan on watching it several more times, which is not something i usually do.  The Dali character has already become a family joke with his \\"Rhinoceroses.\\"One has to be educated to enjoy the movie which is why it will go over the heads of most americans.  one has to know fitzgerald, cole porter, hemingway, man ray, gertrude stein, toulouse lautrec, matisse, dali, etc to \\"get\\" the lines.  the acting was superb and i don't even like owen wilson.  it wasn't as funny as Annie Hall, which i still think is Woody Allen's magnum opus, but is still terrific.  best new movie i've seen since Dark Knight.  and thank heavens, Woody Allen has stuck to making appropriate length movies, not these long drawn out affairs which seem so common these days.  i dont even usually write reviews!  but felt compelled to in this case.  the pedantic character is reminiscent of the scene in Annie Hall where the obnoxious professor is standing behind Allen and Keaton in line for a movie and is spouting off nonsense, and Allen pulls the real author out who tells the professor that he's way off base. the score is great too.  thoroughly enjoyable
0316123587|5.0|The WMHS \\"Glee\\" yearbook is a great addition to the collection of any fan of the show. It is a fun read and is full of great photos and quotes. I feel that the writers did a pretty good job compiling this book. It is full of color and will entertain any dedicated fan. My favorite part is definitely the variety of photographs of the characters.

1400064287|4.0|Have you ever wondered why some ideas seem to stick and others don't ?  This book explores exactly why some ideas seem to have this \\"stick\\" quality more than others.  It was a surprising topic, but as I read, I realized just how critical this quality is to the success of any plan, campaign, or marketing strategy.  Entrepreneurs everywhere will find great wisdom in this book.  It contains many applicable ideas, and is a very enjoyable read.

0307951529|5.0|Inspiring, practical, entertaining--The $100 Startup stands head and shoulders above most other business books out there. You know the ones I'm talking. They sound a clarion call for an unconventional life but then leave you stranded without any real, nuts-and-bolts strategies for making that life happen.<br /><br />This book is different. Chris Guillebeau has stitched together a fascinating collection of success stories from fascinating people whose professional paths are as different from each other as Chris's is from a 9-to-5 desk jockey. He writes honestly about the elbow grease involved with starting a business without making the book some grim tale of entrepreneurial woes, but at the same time he doesn't diminish the accomplishments of the many people he interviewed by portraying them as the \\"lucky\\" ones. The message is pretty straightforward: What do you care about? What are you good at? What needs can you meet in a market associated with those two? Answer these questions, and then get started.<br /><br />The $100 Startup provides a balanced understanding of the mental, professional, and even emotional changes--discontentment, anyone?--that need to happen so that we can find more satisfaction in our work and enjoy more freedom in our lives.<br /><br />I've already started several successful businesses, yet I still found myself eagerly turning pages, taking notes, and planning my next adventure. If you want both a wakeup call and a step-by-step plan, then The $100 Startup is for you.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|I loved Valentines Day and when this movie came out I saw it opening night,which I usually do not do!

0307352145|5.0|Cain has written a remarkable book that is both thoroughly researched and beneficial not only to introverts but to extroverts as well.  While \\"Quiet\\" is not a biography, Cain uses many biographical references juxtaposed with psychological studies to support her argument that introverts are overlooked, oppressed even,  in Western society despite having just as much, even more in some cases, to offer than extroverts.  Of course Cain is writing subjectively being an introvert herself.  However, she does not use the book as a platform to bash extroverts.  She contends that extroverts and introverts both have much to offer and rather than societies favoring one personality type over another there needs to be partnership between both.  She argues that in current Western mentality, extroverts are exalted while introverts are viewed as weak or lacking in character.  According to Cain, this painfully overlooks the fact that there is strength in the quiet introvert.<br /><br />In her introduction Cain writes about the partnership of Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., \\"Parks herself seemed aware of this paradox, calling her autobiography \\"Quiet Strength\\"--a title that challenges us to question our assumptions.  Why shouldn't quiet be strong?  And what else can quiet do that we don't give it credit for?...Take the partnership of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr.: a formidable orator refusing to give up his seat on a segregated bus wouldn't have had the same effect as a modest woman who'd clearly prefer to keep silent but for the exigencies of the situation...Yet today we make room for a remarkably narrow range of personality styles.  We're told that to be great is to be bold, to be happy is to be sociable.  We see ourselves as a nation of extroverts--which means that we've lost sight of who we really are\\"(Pg. 2-3).<br /><br />The book is divided into four sections: 1) The Extrovert Ideal; 2) Your Biology, Your Self?; 3) Do All Cultures Have An Extrovert Ideal; 4) How To Love, How To Work. In the first section Cain demonstrates how extroversion has come to be the standard for Western society.  Cain convincingly argues that the rise of the Extrovert Ideal began with Dale Carnegie.  She writes, \\"Carnegie's metamorphosis from farmboy to salesman to public-speaking icon is also the story of the rise of the extrovert ideal...America had shifted from what the influential cultural historian Warren Susman called a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality...when they embraced the Culture of Personality, Americans started to focus on how others perceived them.  They became captivated by people who were bold and entertaining\\" (Pg. 20-21).  Cain also shares stories about attending a Tony Robbins Unleash-The-Power-Within seminar and visiting Rick Warren's Saddleback Church to further support her contention of the Extrovert Ideal.<br /><br />Cain's distaste for the Tony Robbins seminar and her experience with  Saddleback Church resonate with me--I completely indentify with her!  I feel like these kinds of institutions are pushed upon us by society and Cain convincingly argues that while these institutions may be good for extroverts they are not the best environments for introverts to thrive and our western society would be much better served if this was recognized resulting in more introverted-friendly institutions or environments.<br /><br />Having established that the West lives within the paradigm of the Extrovert Ideal, Cain looks at the psychology and science related to extroversion and introversion in the second section.  The studies that Cain presents are both enlightening and fascinating.  It was interesting for me at least to learn that evidence suggests that 40 to 50 percent of introvertedness and extrovertedness is genetic (Pg. 108).  I was relieved to learn that a third to half of Westerners are introverted.  Moreover, the fact that introvertedness can be tied to genetics gave more credence to the fact that I am normal.Finally, as a quick aside to this section if one is not familiar with the life of Eleanor Roosevelt the brief, yet fascinating, biography found at the beginning of chapter 6 alone makes Cain's book worth purchasing.<br /><br />In the third section, Cain looks at Eastern cultures and shows that the Extrovert Ideal is not universal.  In this section she spends time interviewing Asian students from Harvard's business school and high school students from a public school system in California.  Cain writes, \\"Individuals in Asia see themselves as part of a greater whole--whether family, corporation, or community--and place tremendous value on harmony within their group.  They often subordinate their own desires to the group's interest accepting their place in its hierarchy.  Western culture, by contrast, is organized around the individual\\" (Pg. 188-189).  If there is one area that lacked research in this book this would be it--her research seemed to be limited to those from Eastern cultural backgrounds residing in our Western culture.  It would have been interesting to read about a more thorough discussion of firsthand experience with Eastern cultures.<br /><br />The fourth section can be best summed up in Cain's words, \\"Probably the most common--and damaging--misunderstanding about personality type is that introverts are antisocial and extroverts are pro-social.  But as we've seen, neither formulation is correct; introverts and extroverts are differently social\\" (Pg. 226).  Cain also argues that there is a time for introverts to put on an extroverted face, she writes, \\"Yes, we are only pretending to be extroverts, and yes, such inauthenticity can be morally ambiguous (not to mention exhausting), but if it's in the service of love or a professional calling, then we're just as Shakespeare advised...'To thine own self be true'\\" (Pg. 210).<br /><br />At one point in the book I wrote in the margins, \\"When you boil it down this book is essentially about relationships.\\"  Of course no one is a pure introvert nor a pure extrovert but all of us are going to lean one direction or the other and fall on different points along the spectrum.  Cain's book has helped me realize that if we are more sensitive to these leanings we can be more productive as a society and more importantly we can have more meaning in our lives because our relationships will be deeper.<br /><br />Frankly, this book spoke to me.  For my whole life I have struggled with the fact that I am a \\"quiet\\" person and very introverted--not necessarily shy but, yes, introverted.  I was frustrated that I did not fit what seems to be the norm for our society.  After reading Cain's book I am both thankful for who I am and much more comfortable with who I am.  For the first time I believe that I have a lot to offer not in spite of my introvertedness but because of my introvertedness.  Moreover, this book helped lessen my animosity toward extroverts because I no longer need to be envious of them and this will allow me to approach them in love and community.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!<br /><br />I received this book free from WaterBrook Multnomah for the purposes of this review.

B007NZDES0|5.0|I was fortunate to see the goddess of Love in the City of Brotherly love (Philly).  Listening to her music via CD does not compare to hearing Sade live!!!  I've been a fan since the age of 10. And during the times when Sade didn't have a recording on the airwaves, I followed her other band mates (Stuart Matthewman), who recorded with other artists and was able to still get that same vibe (maxwell, Amel larrieux, etc) So glad there is a dvd/cd coming out of this tour. My favorite song / performance of the night was \\"Pearls\\".  The backdrop of the moon with only Sade on stage and her powerful voice was a moment of transcendence!  Can't wait to purchase this DVD/CD and add to my Sade collection!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Well, where do I begin??!!  I've never read a book like this before but read it out of sheer curiosity because Dr. Oz had a show on about this book and said it was a \\"must read\\" for all women.  I've lost a lot of respect for this man after reading this book.  He said that it should be used as a tool for women.  What garbage.  I've had a lot of exciting sex in my 45 years of marriage and none of it involved whips or steel balls or spanking or bondage.<br /><br />First of all, the dialogue between Ana and Christian was stupid and boring.  She sounded like a naive kid.  She acted like a clumsy oaf.  And Christian finds her so exciting (???) especially when she bites her lip, which she does about 150 times throughout the book!  Give me a break!  I didn't like the character of Christian at all.  He was a sick b--t--d.  And what he was doing to her was so demeaning to any woman.  Why a woman or girl would allow a man to do those things to her, I just don't understand.<br /><br />And also, throughout the entire book, Ana says \\"holy crap\\" or \\"oh crap\\", CONSTANTLY.  And she talks about her \\"inner goddess\\" CONSTANTLY.  It really got boring and annoying.<br /><br />What kept me reading was that I wanted to find out what happened to them and what all the hullabaloo was about this book.  It amazes me that because of a marketing ploy, this book has become a best seller.  I'm sure there are a lot better erotic books out there.

0552560359|5.0|My son loves this book!  It is a great fun book and a wonderful conversation starter!  Great to promote talking and early literacy!  We took this book out with us to a resturant and it kept him busy and talking with us while we waited! Love this book there are so many fun pictures and choices! it's a homerun!
0307951529|5.0|I read this book from the point of view from someone who already has started up. I found that it was clear information covering the basics for any entrepreneur. I LOVE the emphasis on working with the skill set that one already has. There's no need to cultivate new skills or look for a way to make yourself \\"fit\\" into the current market. The emphasis is on looking at what you can do and expanding that into what you would love to do that can be profitable and finding a blend of the two.<br /><br />While reading this book, I kept thinking about the Howard Thurman quote - \\"Don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.\\" the people that Chris has chronicled in this book have done just that. I think that's good advice whether one starts a business or not!<br /><br />Chris Guillebeau clearly has an understanding on how many of us begin our startups. We don't want to ask banks or venture capitalists for money because we don't want to start with loans. This book is not only a jumping off point of inspiration, I found the chapter on \\"Hustling\\" a great reminder about the power of continued marketing through honest self-promotion.<br /><br />Overall, this is an easy, informative read that will add inspiration to anyone looking to launch a business or continue on with their business!

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game has become one of my favorites after getting fed up with never ending games of Risk. I'd recommend getting the 5-6 player extension. When playing 4 players, we find it a lot more fun to use the extension. Although you can have a very competitive game with a lot of trading when play 4 players without the extension.
0345803485|5.0|At first I wasn't really interested in reading the book, but I kept seeing it everywhere and decided I might as well read it.  Once I started reading it I could Not put the book down.  Although I was in my last semester of college and had so much to do I could not stop reading.  I got all three books and finished them within days.  Fabulous books, loved, loved, loved the books and the story.  It was addicting and completely captured my attention.  I loved it so much I wish there was more or a spin off.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|WHAT A FINALE!!  Really...I'm not sure it could have been any better!<br /><br />I loved the way E.L. James began this book.  Instead of walking us through the 'same old, same old'.  She moved us ahead and let us relive some of the not too far back memories in a way that felt refreshing and new (just like everything else with this series).<br /><br />E.L. James has a way of telling a story that prevents you from walking away from it.  Every chapter ends with cliffhanger, and every book (even the last) ends in such a way that you have absolutely no choice but to download immediately the next and keep reading.  Be prepared to sacrifice sleep and ignore the family while you zoom your way through this unique and endearing story.<br /><br />My biggest complaint has nothing to do with this heartwarming series, its realistic characters, or the phenomenal author.  It has everything to do with the people who hate this genre and feel the need to make their very negative opinions public.  My favorite negative reviewers are those coming from the people who hated Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades #1) so much that they bought, read, and rated every book in the series.  With those reviews and in my mind, I quote Shakespeare, \\"The lady (man) doth protest too much, methinks.\\"<br /><br />I'm just not sure who in the world can hate (with so much passion) a book that's underlying message is unconditional love.  This is the story about a man who was beaten, battered, and abused - the reasons for his very, very dark nature - finding that unconditional love can help him be the man that he wants to be.  It is powerful to see his transformation from a man embracing turmoil and darkness to a man who is in love and carefree...a man who concludes that he does not have to live the life he witnessed as a small child or let the affects of it shape him as an adult.<br /><br />I can only speak for myself personally, but when I think back on this very moving series, my favorite parts of the book have nothing to do with the extremely detailed sex scenes.  Honestly, there were some that I just had to skip.  Instead, my heart remembers fondly the sweet and bonding moments that were unrelated to sex and had everything to do with falling in deep and meaningful love.<br /><br />I'm not sure there has ever been a series like this...but I'm sure there will never be another.  It's unique qualities can't be reproduced.  Despite this book's predominant genre, I don't regret one minute I spent reading it.  Great job and congratulations, E.L.

As a chocolate lover, I could envision myself working in the candy factory.  I wanted to purchase the DVD just by watching the TV previews when the movie was released.  Excellent movie for older children and those young at heart.  Thank you Amazon for having the best price for this DVD.

B0059XTV4Y|4.0|The much maligned, brief theatrical film by Madonna - W.E. - fairs better on the small screen than it likely did in the movie houses. The stories are bifurcated, each one resembling a television creation - one a docudrama biopic, the other a contemporary soap opera.  That Madonna, who directed and wrote the screenplay with Alek Keshishian, decided to mix the two stories is a bit daring but in some ways it works very well.  In other ways the parallel stories seem like time traveling cars on the same highway that never quite travel at the same speed or quality.<br /><br />The film mixes the notorious affair between King Edward VIII and American divorc&eacute;e Wallis Simpson with a contemporary romance between a married woman and a Russian security guard. The time is 1998 and at an auction of the estate of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor unhappily married ex-Sotheby employee Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) becomes obsessed by their historic love story. Her own marriage to womanizing, abusive psychiatrist William (Richard Coyle) undermines her feelings of worth and as she learns more about the sacrifices involved in the famous affair, she gains her own courage to find happiness.<br /><br />The film flips back and forth between the present and the 1930s and it is the historical aspect of the film that is almost flawless. We get to know Wallis Simpson (in a brilliant portrayal by Andrea Riseborough) and understand her failed first two marriages (at the time we meet her she is still married to Ernest Simpson played by David Harbour), and see the American sizzle that made her the talk of England. When Wallis wrangles her way to meet Prince Edward, better known as David, (James D'Arcy) there is a chemistry that develops to the point of passion and ultimately leads to Wallis divorcing Ernest to marry Edward - a deed that leads to Edward's abdication of the throne for `the woman I love', which he had assumed when King George V (James Fox) dies, to his stammering brother Bertie (Laurence Fox) and his caustic wife Elizabeth (Natalie Dormer).  The paparazzi make their life miserable and the couple is not allowed to return to England until Edward dies, with the faithful Wallis supportively by his side through 36 years of marriage.<br /><br />Wally - meanwhile - longs to be pregnant but sustains such abuse from William that she ultimately yields to the loving friendship the auction house Russian security guard Evgeni (Oscar Isaac) and begins her life again.  The two stories are connected by Wally's obsession with the royal couple's notorious affair and at auction's end she is given access to private letters between Wallis and Edward that have been in the possession of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Haluk Bilginer) - a tacked on ending that feels ill at ease and redundant.<br /><br />Everyone connected t the biopic angle of this film is excellent and Madonna shows that she knows how to direct affairs of the heart in a royal situation very well indeed. Both Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy are superb and the costumes and music and cinematography of this historical portion are exceptionally well done.  Though the idea of the contemporary sluggish story is reasonable, Abbie Cornish seems uncomfortable with the script: Oscar Isaac shines as her new love.  In all the film, though spotty, has merit and it not a bad debut for Madonna as director.  Grady Harp, May 12ence Fox) and his caustic wife Elizabeth (Natalie Dormer).

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought the first book in this series was ok, but the second was incredible!!  I appreciated the fact that the steamy parts made more sense and weren't just out there.  I really liked the fact that we got to know this couple as a couple and watch them grow.  There were a lot of answers given in this book that weren't answered in the first.  Just a great book, and I can't wait to get into the third book.
0307951529|4.0|Chris Guillebeau's philosophy is that the most rewarding work takes work, and that it should be done for personal fulfillment as much as for financial freedom. The 100 or so businesses used as case studies in the book reinforce this philosophy--each of these microbusinesses employs five or fewer employees (many are solopreneurs), and most are designed to stay that way.<br /><br />This is not, in other words, a book about building a massive, franchised empire from a single taco stand, nor designing killer iOS apps that get bought by Facebook for a billion dollars: it's about helping you to come up with a solid idea at the intersection of your passion and a customer's need to create a business that can support your full range of needs.<br /><br />To that end, the book provides a wealth of tested concepts and tools, intertwined with stories illustrating how they apply to creating success in a small business. There are checklists for evaluating the business-worthiness of your ideas and for prepping a product launch. There are formulas for constructing a marketing offer or creating a self-published work. There are charts that explain the different types of sales methods and that map the difference between passions that are fun for you and passions that will work in the marketplace.<br /><br />As the author notes, this is not a book meant to be read for information only; it's intended as an actual blueprint for building a business, which means you'll need to supply the elbow grease. And at just over 300 pages, it's unlikely to serve as a complete guide to running a business, even the very particular kind of service-driven, internet-fueled micro-minibusiness featured inside.<br /><br />But what The $100 Startup lacks in depth it makes up for in breadth and readability. There's more than enough inside to get you started, and even well on your way, if you're willing to do the work.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I buy Kindle books on Amazon, I tend to look at three things: what people who liked what I like bought and what are the top-rated books in a genre, and afterwards the first few reviews. With the Wool Omnibus, I really liked the first review and decided to give it a try. I started slow, because I am not a lot into postapocalyptic fiction, though I read a lot of it in time. But the first chapter held something mesmerising, something deep, which made me want to learn more - was it the characters ? Was it the grit ? Was it the purpose/quest ? Was it the things left unsaid ? Was it the complexity of the world and of the characters ?... Probably something of everything. And the more I read, the more I empathised with this universe, with its inhabitants, with the characters - including the \\"secondary\\" ones which are not secondary at all, just human and thus integral to the whole. What I saw while reading was life, at its most beautiful, or often ugly, and always under the sign of the human.. complexity - as I cannot dare say equation, as one lady seems to prove again and again.<br /><br />What you will see will be instantly recognisable, and still utterly new. Heartily recommended !

The result of their efforts is this clear and accessible guide to protest law, the only handbook available, in fact, which covers protest law in both its civil and criminal aspects.<br /><br />Recently published by Bloomsbury Professional, the book examines and focuses upon the rights of protesters under the European Convention on Human Rights, which -- as the admirable Shami Chackrabarti, together with James Welch of `Liberty' point out in the Foreword -- established a positive right to protest for the first time in the United Kingdom, specifically under Articles 10 (freedom of expression) and 11 (freedom of assembly).<br /><br />It's a sobering thought that previous protests throughout history, at least in a Western context, have not had a Human Rights Act as such, to protect their activities, or their rights.  The slave army of Spartacus in ancient Rome was defeated, with each of the several thousand survivors eventually crucified.  The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was quashed and its leaders, including Wat Tyler subsequently executed.<br /><br />And as an example of the voice of the lone protestor in the wilderness, we recall the story of one William Prynne, a barrister at Lincoln's Inn, who roughly in the 1640s, wrote a series of pamphlets protesting against the excesses of Charles I.  For his efforts, he endured the dismemberment of his ears, followed by the branding of both cheeks with `SL' for `Seditious Libeller'.  Didn't stop him though; he carried on pamphleteering.<br /><br />Closer to our own time, there have been any number of protests, from the Chartists, to the suffragist movement, to the more than 20 year Civil Rights movement in the US and the anti-Vietnam protests and so forth, including the dissenters against the now defunct Soviet Union and latterly, the thousands of participants in the `Arab Spring.'<br /><br />Just contemplating the raw courage and personal sacrifice of this assortment of protesters past and present is a humbling experience, which frankly, reminds some of us that you don't really have to be all that brave anymore to protest in a free society - and good thing too.<br /><br />Your rights, as outlined in this scholarly and eminently readable and accessible handbook, are protected, at least in law, although in reality, the actual risks faced by protesters still remain very real, with protesters often ending up arrested and/or in court.<br /><br />At the moment, what might be termed the law of protest remains a niche area in which many practitioners have little experience.  This book therefore, will almost certainly emerge as a landmark text which offers a guide to the legal issues involved, including police powers, human rights, criminal law, the legality of administrative action and elements of land law and more.<br /><br />Within its approximately 500 pages, the book offers a wide range of research resources, including tables of statutes, statutory instruments and cases, plus five useful appendices, not to mention the accompanying updating service available online when you purchase the book, which certainly you should do if you find yourself involved professionally in this often vexed area of law.

0439023483|4.0|As many have said, I loved the premise of this book. Borrowing from Lord of the Flies, the book chronicles a young woman's experience as she is swept up into a cruel, gladiator-like battle royal between fellow teens from different districts. All of this occurs at the fancy of a ruthless, totalitarian regime that wants to punish the districts for staging a rebellion against their leadership many decades prior. This book is extremely engaging, but it is not without faults. Told in the first person, we end up gaining the protagonist's perspective fully but lose much of what goes on behind the scenes. This serves to propel the action forward---but ultimately fails to put those experiences into a higher context. Fact is, there is/was a lot going on behing the scenes. For example, I would have loved to get more of a sense of what was going through the Chief Gamemaker's mind. Also would have loved to know a little bit more about the Capitol.<br /><br />Collins has a way with action sequences (some of which had me on the edge of my seat)--but makes little attempt to develop any of her characters beyond the superficial. I never found myself believing in the love triangle--in part because I never got to know Gale. A few more introspective moments involving Peeta might have also given me reason to care more about him as a charater. Rue also came and went without any significant character development. Having said this, I found this to be one of the more memorable books that I have read in some time. I riffled through it on a plane trip and felt the need to finish it as soon as I got a chance (which meant reading long into the night). That is the mark of a good book....but not a great one.---Just rue (no pun intended) the missed opportunities to slow the book down a little, and cater a little more to an older readership who seeks a little more than what was given.
1846612837|5.0|THIS IS THE ONLY WORK ON THE SUBJECT WHICH PRESENTS EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN A SINGLE VOLUME --WITH FREE CD ROM.<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Cohabitation is now becoming more prevalent, with almost half of children now being born outside marriage. It's a little surprising, then, that this new fifth edition of `Cohabitation: Law Practice and Precedents' from Jordan's Family Law imprint -- is apparently the only main work on cohabitation law which provides commentary, checklists, procedural guides and precedents in a single convenient volume.<br /><br />While there are many safeguards which place cohabitants on more or less the same footing as married couples, it's pointed out in Eleanor King's foreword that the two major exceptions to this lie in the areas of property and finances.  In these two areas primarily, cohabitants certainly don't have the same rights as married couples, not yet anyway, due to current public policy.<br /><br />Not many couples realize this of course.  Predictably, and understandably, when they do decide to cohabit, they are not apt to rush headlong into a lawyer's office at the heady start of their relationship just to find out what their rights are in law.  The usual pattern for cohabitants unfortunately, is to consult lawyers or advisers only when their relationship starts to come unstuck, or when there's a sudden crisis.<br /><br />At this stage, overwhelming complexities can emerge relating to any number of issues of dispute, from property rights (i.e. who owns what?) ownership of chattels, taxation and parental responsibilities, to pension rights, welfare benefits, separation agreements, death and succession and much more besides.<br /><br />All this notwithstanding, the book sensibly takes a `prevention is better than cure' approach, especially in the chapter on ante-nuptial agreements.  And, as the many issues relating to cohabitation ultimately touch on all aspects of law and practice, the book takes a multi-disciplinary approach to this often vexed subject.<br /><br />Logically presented in ten sections, the book contains vital material new to this edition. It takes account of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 and presents analyses of recent and significant case law, such as the Supreme Court's ruling in Jones v Kernott.  The section on welfare benefits is also new and all the precedents covered are contained in the accompanying CD ROM.<br /><br />Scholarly, thorough and readable, this is a book designed with the needs of the busy practitioner in mind.  Its extensive resources for further research include tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and international material.<br /><br />If you're advising cohabiting couples on any aspect of law, this book, particularly in this new edition, should be regarded as a definitive guide to the subject and an essential purchase.

0765350386|4.0|This is a promising series which unfortunately closes up so many loose ends that the reader will probably wonder if the author painted himself into a corner. Almost all of the big obstacles to the success of the heroes get resolved at the very end and only minor conflicts are left. In essence, the author has to start all over again which seems like an extra chore when writing a long fantasy series.<br /><br />The tale focuses upon a group of sophisticated rogues who are going to pull off the ultimate heist in a dystopian fantasy world namely slay the evil ruler, wipe out his many minions and resources and then make off with all of the treasury funds. Oh, yeah, they're going to rule the capitol city, too. The problem here is that the peasants who they want to revolt against the empire are underfed and magically reduced in any emotions that might make them feel like rebelling. Additionally, most of the people with magical powers are nobles and they side with the evil ruler. Semi powerful types are known as Misted and full fledged magical types are Mistborn. The only way to get this power is to have noble blood in you so as a result there are a tiny minority of peasants who have these powers but don't know it or come into it over time. Of course, any such children found out by the evil empire are put to death in order to control the playing field.<br /><br />Speaking of the magic that was probably the most intriguing part of the book for those who have read a lot of fantasy and get the same magic systems over and over. Magic is fueled by trace minerals that are ingested by those with the power. A Misted can only ingest one type of metal but a Mistborn can take as many trace minerals as desired (there are a standard 8 with some surprises). Mistborn are rare even in the nobility and as a result are highly prized by the powerful.<br /><br />Anyway, said thieving crew go about dismantling the capitol city and while certain parts of it made enough sense other parts did not.I will detail this more in the spoilers section at the very bottom. Definite pet peeve for me. I hate it when the good people go up against a more powerful evil and do things that just don't come across as believable.<br /><br />Vin, the abused poor teenage girl, was my favorite viewpoint character as well as her love interest. The love story between them was actually well done. Kelsier, the soul bruised leader of the rebellion, was somewhat interesting and his crew varied from generic fantasy archetypes that needed some life breathed into them to some somewhat good sub characters.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; FANTASY SETUP/MYTHOLOGY/HISTORY/LANDS: B; MAGIC SYSTEM: B plus to A minus; WRITING STYLE: B minus to B; ACTION SCENES: B to B plus; WHEN READ: February to April 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />(1) so first off Kelsier destroying the Lord Ruler's mines was a bit too easy. I get that he had been down there but he went down there in one evening and figured out how to destroy/delay their resources. If the Lord Ruler is like a God who is supposed to be intelligent and has a ton of advisors around him and this empire has been going on for quite some time why is that nobody created any contingency plans or a simple means to make sure nobody did such a thing to economically topple their empire? This was one guy who crawled down into an unguarded hole and destroyed the special resources and nobody ever thought that maybe they should collapse/seal those fissures or posted guards 24/7? Derp, derp, derp!; (2) Kelsier and Vin break in with their trusty servant (Sazed) and deal with the Steel Inquisitors and pretty much come out alive. I had thought that maybe they would be fearful enough but like most fantasy authors they just aren't willing to show the heroes get seriously beat up or killed. After their first tangle I didn't really worry about them when they dealt with future opponents. In essence the Steel Inquisitors just became straw knights that were easily tossed aside.; (3) The Lord Ruler showing up and slaying Kelsier and then Kelsier showing up later was a total fantasy cheat. It would have had a lot more impact if the dude stayed dead. Take a lesson from A GAME OF THRONES. Jesus Christ. (4) I feel that a capitol city in the empire should have had more magic and such at its disposal to have caught this thieving crew. For the most part the empire was slow on the reply and the heroes were for the most part steps ahead of them. One would think that an empire with unlimited resources in comparison to the thieving crew would have had better people on hand. If not, just hire the thieving crew. Half of them were doing it for the money anyway. Oh, wait, then there would be no story. Anyway, this should have been made more believable.; and (5) Overall it felt like a big cheat. This Dark Lord is ruling, yes, and the world is in chaos but he seemed too easily displaced. And if that group could do it why didn't a previous group do it before? The Lord Ruler was considered something of a deity and could not be defeated and yet he was pushed aside with ease at the end. I get the author wanted his heroes to win the good fight but the execution was questionably delivered.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />The magic system known as Allomancy was done well. It wasn't detailed too much in my opinion to drag everything down and there's a chart in back for people who missed things.; (2) There was an interesting resource control system in which those with the Allomancy powers could mate with the peasants but had to kill them afterwards because children not controlled by the empire was undesirable; (3) The memoirs of the Lord Ruler were somewhat interesting but there could have been a lot more there and the ball was dropped a bit.; (4) The servant guy, Sazed, was well done. He revealed some back histories which gave the world flavor.; (5) The love storybetween Vin and Elend Venture was well done. In some instances I found myself enjoying those chapters more than the unbelievable \\"destroy the empire and we can do it because we're the heroes\\" tale.; (6) I liked the soother guy, \\"Breeze\\", even though he was a generic archetype of sorts. (7) Some of the action fights were well done even though I stopped really worrying about Kelsier after he came back from the dead. What a cheat. (8) The demonstration of Allomancy tied into several action scenes was particularly well done.; (9) The idea of a dark ruler having won and polluted the empire with falling ashes and a beaten down peasantry was well done. The decadent nobility attending balls at the different noble houses gave the drab peasantry lifestyle a nice contrast.; (10) the kid rogue of the crew (who was hardly known) had a strange accent that mixed words around on the page. I thought this was a nice touch dealing with different dialects of the same language.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best shows I've ever seen.  Season 6 starts out a bit depressing but it gets a lot better.  This show rocks!  Watch it immediately!
0307951529|4.0|As someone who began my first business without realizing I was starting a business and then figuring it out as I've gone along, this book resonated with me in several ways.<br /><br />Chris shared story after story of people who turned their passions and interests into successful businesses by jumping in and figuring it out as they went. And not just any business: businesses that they cared about and that lay at the intersection of the things they are good at/passionate about and what people need and will pay for. He states that the purpose of creating your own business is to create freedom for yourself (financial and time-wise) and to create value for others. Right from the start Chris had me thinking about my own business and how I might be able to create more value to offer to the world!<br /><br />The thing I liked best about this book is that it encourages you to just get started already. You don't have to have an MBA to start a business. You don't have to have $25,000. You don't have to get a loan and be in debt to a bank. It doesn't have to be hard or scary, and people are doing it every day, in creative and unconventional ways. You can have an idea, create a website or even a simple blog, and that's enough to get started.<br /><br />The chapters in Part 2 of the book, about creating your product offering, how to launch it, and how to promote it, which the most useful, in my opinion. Chris details a successful path to launching a product into the world and a 39-step plan for what should be in a launch. I will definitely be referencing it next time I launch a new product!<br /><br />I would have liked to read about more examples of people who created their business and DIDN'T see immediate success but rather saw success grow slowly over time and with many mistakes and much learning along the way! I like reading about the mistakes that people have made and what they learned from them and found myself wishing there were more of those types of examples in this book. But the examples he did include were inspiring.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book to help you get over your excuses for why you can't begin your business, this is the book for you! It's not a highly-detailed how-to-start-your-business book, but it will definitely serve as inspiration to read about so many people who've created successful businesses on a small budget, in creative ways, and without ever being a business owner before. You will definitely learn how to effectively craft your message and your offering to create maximum results, which is highly useful!<br /><br />All in all, this is a great read that's a nice mix of inspiration, encouragement, and practical advice on how to be successful in your business. I recommend adding it to your arsenal of business books!
0345803485|1.0|After hearing rave reviews from a local radio station, I decided to give this one a shot. I will not bore you with the summary, since there are plenty of those, but here is why you should stay away. The writing is horrendous- the same phrases and words are used over and over again, and the not pithy ones that make you smile. Visualize reading \\"Holy cow\\" twenty times, it gets more than repetitive. The characters are one dimensional. They are stagnant, stuck together by lust and neediness. Think Twilight, but with a XXX rating. The main characters, Ana, is a filler role. She is someone that women who read this book can insert themselves into. She is self described as average, and has no significant qualities that would attract her to anyone. If you are still thinking of picking up this read, thinking, \\"why not? I wouldn't mind reading about an average woman having sex with an adonis,\\" please think again. The sex is excessive. It's not the raunchy sex acts that the two characters share, in fact, this is where the writing is actually descriptive and worthy of getting published, but it is the amount of sex that these people have. I'll be honest- the first sex scene was pretty steamy, but if you're reading sex scene after sex scene after sex scene, your mind is actually looking forward to these two characters sharing a normal dinner and talking politics. By the way, that never happens. These characters never converse about anything but sex and how much they want each other. You may think that I am exaggerating, but no, dear reader, it is excessive to the point where I started skipping these pages. The characters have the emotional intelligence of thirteen year olds stuck in adult bodies. They have the tools and apparently know how to use them, but are so into each other, and yet so insecure that I was left shouting at the book, screaming \\"why am I reading this?\\"<br />On the other hand, if you are an avid fan of Twilight and do not mind putting your intelligence on hold for a few hours, and would like to visualize porn sex scenarios- please go ahead by all means. Don't say I didn't warn you.r a few hours, and would like to visualize porn sex scenarios- please go ahead by all means. Don't say I didn't warn you.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Amazon did a great job for delivering this box set to Malaysia in 7 days time through iParcel which was perceived lousy service by many customers. The packaging is very good. The discs are stored inside the book-like sleeves. I like the artwork of the whole box set using scrap book concept. The discs are great! Pictures and sound are so detailed and defined. Never seen any of these movies in such form before! Plenty of extras to look through for the hardcore fans. This is a good deal during the discounts season which made it more affordable. Recommended for any ALIEN hardcore fans!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think they everyone will love this because it is an intertaining game and it makes you want to get the next game
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|A must have for anybody that own a blu ray player! The presentation of these movies are of DEMO QUALITY to show off your home theater system. Pictures and sound with crystal clear quality! Its classic mind blowing masterpiece with the concept that changed the movie world since the first Matrix released in 1999. Some lovers and haters for the 2nd and 3rd installment but overall this is the best box set ever released to date! With additional  discs on the production and animatrix, you can't go wrong with this box set! Nothing to complain... JUST GET IT!

B006OT03BM|2.0|This is a marvelous collector's item for any Transformers fan. However why the heck there are cellophane tapes across all the front discs. One of the blu ray's front layer was peeled off during removal of the tape across the blu rays. DAMN! My collection is of no value anymore as the disc was damaged. I would strongly advise Amazon to contact the discs manufacturers to stop attaching cellophane tape on the blu ray discs, they ain't gonna fall off as its in the BOX!? I got my refund from Amazon, but I am frustrated and sad that this had to happen to my favorite limited edition box set. Its priceless but the damaged is irreversible!!! This is the only risk for potential-buyers need to take if you are reading this review!
B0028MBKVG|3.0|An \\"ultramarathoner\\" I am not, nor aspire to be.  I run 10-15 miles per week and was hoping this book would give some techniques on increasing distance in my runs.  Well it wasn't until chapter 25 that it got into the nitty gritty of this information.  Don't get me wrong, the stories are pretty fascinating about these unbelievable athletes but for the \\"practical\\" knowledge for the weekend warrior runner that I am, the good stuff starts 3/4 of the way through the book.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Bourne trilogy is a must see for any action genre fans! The movies are great, picture and sound quality is just marvelous. Nice story line as per the books. Some controversy about comparison between the books and movies but it is no concern for me as these 3 movies just rocked! Detailed and crisps to the eyes and ears! Tonnes of extras inside. Nothing much to complain! In short get this box set if you are a Bourne fan or first time watching this trilogy (First time watching these movies for me!) You will never be disappointed!

B003VR5PPY|5.0|Ah, the point and click adventure, titan of the late 80s-early 90s and now almost dead, comatose, barely on life support. THANK YOU AKSYS for this gem, the adult themed foray into this wonderful almost defunct genre. Too bad when you go to a best buy you can find thousands of copies of awful licensed titles like Mary Kay and Ashley Dress Up and the Wuzzles Count to 10, but finding games like this is like looking for the lost ark of the covenant. Games like this were what the DS was made for. I won't elaborate on the already copious glowing reviews, they say it all, if you like point and click adventure, and don't mind reading and own a DS, it would be stupid not to buy this game!<br /><br />- SIGH -<br /><br />reading, Reading...READING! *(@#)*<br /><br />I've worked in software development and I know what happened, some A-hole, probably in marketing said, you know it's too confusing. I want you (the designers and producers) to painfully, verbosely, in the most tedious time consuming way possible, make the user read instructions to EVEN THE MOST basic of mini games. I want them to read line after line of text every time they have to click the screen to change numbers on a suitcase combination lock. I want an already slow experience (albeit interesting) to be slowed from a crawl to a stop with voluminous instructions on the most basic things, and i want those instructions to appear every time they engage in the puzzle.<br /><br />but you know...that's not all, I don't want this to happen just in the beginning tutorial phase, I want this to persist throughout the game.<br /><br />MY GOD PLEASE AKSYS if you make another game like this (and God willing you will, this game is rad, so interesting, I love it) please understand, if the player doesn't understand how the DS works and actually needs all these instructions, then they lack the cognitive capability to play the game.
B00723NWJE|1.0|The problem with Norah's new CD is that the music is boring.  Her old stuff had catchy melodies and was produced well.  After listening to this CD, no song jumps out.  There are no melodies that catch your attention.<br />Every musician has the right to experiment.  But I don't think Norah's experimentation has produced anything worthwhile.  Regardless of what kind of music a person does, it has to be GOOD.  There has to be a reason to keep people coming back and listening.  I don't like her new stuff.  The songs have nothing to draw you in.  The production gets in the way of the music.  Very disappointed.

B004AOECUG|5.0|\\"Raging Bull\\" is my sole test so far of whether Blu-ray high definition matters with black and white films.  I purchased this 30th anniversary edition from an Amazon Marketplace seller, and the cover is different from what Amazon shows.  Proof of Purchase says \\"Raging Bull 30th Anniversary\\", good enough for me.<br /><br />Very few famous directors shot their features in black and white after Technicolor took over.  Martin Scorsese was an exception with \\"Raging Bull\\".  It looks and sounds highly unusual, while Robert De Niro's incredible performance earned him the 1980 Oscar for Best Actor.  \\"Raging Bull\\" is a masterpiece.<br /><br />There's no doubt about this being a real \\"Raging Bull\\" Blu-ray in High Definition, thanks to a handful of well-lit scenes.  Yet I don't believe Blu-ray adds enough to black and white, so this experiment is over.  I will stick to Blu-rays in modern Technicolor.  Of course \\"The Artist\\" is yet to make its statement on this subject, unlikely to change my mind.<br /><br />A great reason for renting/buying this 30th anniversary edition of \\"Raging Bull\\" is the huge number of special features, which leave no stone unturned.  New, recently filmed interviews are a highlight.  For example, De Niro wanted to make the film, while Scorsese was turned off by boxing and not interested.  De Niro kept pushing Scorsese, who finally went along after a few years, primarily to please his star.<br /><br />The studio resisted De Niro's idea of actually gaining the weight necessary to play Jake La Motta as he later existed.  Padding would be easier and better for De Niro's health said the studio, also saving time + money.  De Niro got his way yet again, gaining something in the range of 50 pounds, looking like a completely different person, which was the entire point.<br /><br />Filming had to be shut down after every scene of De Niro at his fighting weight was completed.  Unheard of, as De Niro began eating and eating, the only thing happening.<br /><br />The real Jake La Motta claims to have personally trained De Niro into becoming a great fighter.  This I don't believe, La Motta making it up.  Also phony in my opinion is La Motta saying he went 1,000 rounds with De Niro as part of this alleged \\"training\\".  The script was a nightmare, constantly being changed until both Scorsese and De Niro finally were satisfied with the version they fine-tuned themselves.<br /><br />All fight scenes were carefully choreographed by Scorsese, punch by punch.  Real boxers rather than actors played La Motta's opponents in the ring.  Key casting decisions resulted from Joe Pesci's suggestions, non-actors, just like Joe Pesci, who had given up on acting.  Scorsese was criticized at the time for taking jobs away from real actors, but didn't care.  Joe Pesci suddenly had an acting career, thanks to Scorsese, even an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in \\"Goodfellas\\" (1990), after being nominated and losing in that category for \\"Raging Bull\\" a decade earlier.eal Jake La Motta claims to have personally trained De Niro into becoming a great fighter.

0393088774|3.0|In a nutshell, Krugman says that, contrary to popular dogma, the national debt is not our greatest problem, rather, the greatest problem we face right now is unemployment and austerity is not the solution, instead, another much larger stimulus, along with a proper dosage of inflation, is what can cure what ails us.<br /><br />He has some good points to make. Austerity did not work during the Great Depression and it's not working in either England or anywhere else in Europe right now where it's being applied. On the other hand, I remain skeptical about the idea of another (larger) stimulus. He argues that it \\"worked\\" for the Great Depression with the giant expansion in government spending during WWII, which did get people working and back on their feet...during WWII. The evidence that this is what sustained growth and employment thereafter, however, is not as cut and dried as he makes it all seem and it's not at all clear that another much larger stimulus would do anything more than create larger temporary effects in the present day either. Krugman criticizes the \\"Austerians\\" for believing in the \\"Confidence Fairy\\", but seems to have unwittingly invoked the same delusional thinking when proposing his own solutions. Inflation, for example, which he proposes as another useful tool, (assuming that you can keep it inside the gateway from Pandora's Box by holding it steady at 4%), might have a more long term impact on trimming down the debt, but not if you are piling even more debt onto it at the same time.<br /><br />Krugman correctly identifies umemployment and lack of demand as being by far the greater problem for the moment, when juxtaposed next to the debt, which is more of a long term problem (but a significant one all the same). However, there are no clear and easy solutions to any of these problems, although Krugman would like us to think so, if only we were willing to drink the kool-aid.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book.  Hugh Howey has created a fully fleshed out and unique post-apoplectic world.  His writing style of moving between events, people, and time had purpose to it and kept me up at late at night both reading and just thinking about what was happening to one of the other characters.  Sometimes the uses of these devices can be confusing or done just for the sake of being different, but Howey uses them effectively to keep the reader engrossed in his tale.<br /><br />While I would not go as far as calling this the next great Science Fiction classic as some reviewers have suggested, due to lack of complex themes and relatively little personal conflict within the characters, this was a fantastic read.  If Hugh Howey writes 5 more books on each of the 50 other silo's, I promise I will buy every single one!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I'VE BEEN MOONING OVER COLIN FIRTH SINCE I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM IN PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. BRIDGETT JONES DIARY JUST SEALED THE DEAL FOR ME. After I watched him in The Kings Speech I found myself standing at the door with my bags packed ready to fly of to London to pursue the possibility of stalking uh I mean uhhh spotting him in a crowd yeah that's what I meant uh huh.  Thankfully for both of us my passport had expired. I've now become an official Firth Zombie .<br /><br />I only went to the theater twice last year and and I can't seem to remember the other movie at all. It wasn't that it was all that forgettable to be fair. It just had to displace this movie from my memory and it just couldn't do it. The restrained passion that is unleashed in this film has you riveted to the screen. The characters while larger than life are just simple human beings in the end. Their need to be significant in their families lives while upholding their duties is a constant drain on their egos. Precious little is left of the peaceful little insular family life for Bertie or his teacher.. The Nation is on a precipice of war and anger against the monarchies frivolities is rampant . A tormented child grown to manhood is being dragged to the front of this spectacle to deliver some much needed motivation and strength via a rousing speech . Can he do it . When it comes right down to it will he be able to deliver the goods. Yes he well and yes they did. A generational gap 0f 60 years would not be enough to dim the purpose and intent of this film. To make you feel that need and that sacrifice. Of a man, a Nation and their families. Well done.<br /><br />I will end this on the note that my other love in cinema is for action adventure and there is plenty to choose from in the states of blockbusters with enormous budgets. Harrison Ford movies immediately come to mind. He was Paid 65 million dollars to be Indiana Jones 4. That Films budget was 185 million and earned 786 million and some change. The entire budget for the Kings Speech was 15 million . It hauled in 250 million. The amount earned by actors is often more a reflection on the actor's ability to get butts in seats and most of the time no reflection on the quality of the acting delivered or the movie itself.  Colin Firth you are woefully under paid. Ask for more next time. You delivered the Goods ; your pay should reflect it. Please continue with your speech...or not . You could fill seats either way.

B000MKD9P6|5.0|As an avid reader it is very rare that I enjoy a movie more than I do the book, but with The Devil Wears Prada it wasn't even close. The movie took the book and the characters to a whole other level---and I enjoyed every moment of it.<br /><br />We get to see Andrea in the beginning going for a job interview at a magazine, just trying to get her foot in the door. At the time she has no idea what Runway is and what it means to others, but when she meets Emily and then Miranda, she sees that for some fashion is not just something to wear. It is a lifestyle.<br /><br />We then get to watch the evolution in Andrea's personal and professional lives, and at that point we can see not just the effect of Miranda on her but Emily opening herself up to what is possible for her.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada is not as much about Miranda as it is about the choices we make about the life we live. In fact Miranda share that lesson with Emily in one of the most powerful conversations in the whole movie. \\"Everybody wants to be us,\\" she said. Everyone wants to be admired, respected and recognized for what they bring to the world. In that moment, Emily realizes that the confidence she has gotten from working at Runway can be hers no matter where she is.<br /><br />This is a movie that will entertain you, make you laugh and also make you think. It also shows that sometimes lessons can come from the most unlikely of sources.

1576754227|5.0|I honestly don't understand people that rate this less than 4 stars. I understand not everyone will see 5 star value, but less than 4 doesn't make sense. To those that say everything in here is obvious- Hell yes it is! But why then have we all not been doing it? It is because everything seems obvious in retrospect. All of the ideas that are contained in the book are also super simple and uncomplicated. Here is the sentence revised with the important BUT => All of the ideas that are contained in the book are also super simple and uncomplicated, but I did not fully understand how to put them all together until I read this book. Simple as that.<br /><br />Think of the concepts in this book as Ockhams Razor. The simplest answer is usual the correct one. That is what this book contains, simple answers. Simple solutions, plans and goals to help you maximize productivity in your life. I could give you individual concepts and examples from the book, but what this book is about is understanding and implementing ALL of the concepts and ideas. So with that said I will just say that after reading this book I have already changed so many ways that I handle things in my life. I also have a renewed vigor because it has helped me envision success in my goals (both long and short term) as many small steps instead of one huge and daunting step. Why did I not see it before? I don't know, but that no longer matters because I am doing it now. It is as simple as that, and simple is good.<br /><br />If you find that you are struggling with personal success and learning to thrive, then this book was written for you. It is only 124 pages, but it will change your life if you implent the concepts that it contains.<br /><br />Ryan

0307951529|5.0|This is the best and most comprehensive book on starting your own business that I've found yet. It's well-written, engaging, entertaining and very polished and organized. It is a very effective business book that is also a great read. What makes it different?<br /><br />Learn from Chris AND the Case Studies<br /><br />Practical advice not just from one successful entrepreneur, but the collected wisdom from the 1500 case studies. Usually in books  or e-Books about starting a business (especially online), you're hearing from the success of just 1, instead of this kind of collection, or you get a business writer writing about the success of others but not a successul entrepreneur themselves. That makes it incredibly valuable to get Chris' perspective on all these cases.<br /><br />Not just theory, but Specific Tools<br /><br />While Chris does a great job taking you through the ideas behind a successful passion-based business, planning your business, promotion, product launches and so many other key topics, he backs it up with the entertaining stories and specific checklists and tools to help you put it into action.<br /><br />This book is great for anyone who wants to start a business, already has an idea or startup, or has a functioning business. Anyone can learn from it, and save yourself a lot of time and money and frustration along your path. Its worth many times the cover price.<br /><br />We especially recommend it for the new Momtrepreneurs or parents who want to start a business to supplement their family income or go - and there's a number of relevant stories in the book as well.<br /><br />Jamie and Monica Maltman
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I found this book quite interesting. It gives a fascinating insight into introverts, of course, but also the many shades of our collective personalities.

B006HGXGWU|3.0|Michael Shannon is Curtis LaForche, an ordinary husband who starts seeing alarming visions. He firmly believes \\"a storm\\" is coming - by storm he means something catastrophic - and builds a shelter in the backyard for his family, but people around Curtis including his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) suspect that his recent \\"strange\\" behaviors may have something to do with mental disorder.<br /><br />\\"Take Shelter\\" is more like a psychological drama than a thriller, and its strength lies in the powerhouse performance of Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain as a happily married couple, whose peaceful life with their lovely daughter slowly falls apart. Shannon's performance is actually borderline overacting, but is compelling nonetheless.<br /><br />Writer and director Jeff Nichols keeps the film's \\"apocalyptic\\" factors to the minimum, focusing the change of the protagonist caused by his premonition that something terrible is going to happen. This is a wise decision, but unfortunately, the way he executed needs improvement.<br /><br />Seeing dreams, or visions if you like, is one of the most overused devices in film. \\"Take Shelter\\" relies on too much on this \\"dream\\" sequence that happens once or twice too many. A more resourceful director would transform this hackneyed method into something more gripping, propelling the film's narrative forward in a more compelling way. Though several scenes show the director's unmistakable skills in building up tension, the whole plotline is weak and after all sluggish until the climax.<br /><br />\\"Take Shelter\\" succeeds most in creating a convincing portrait of a man who is tormented by unsettling visions. As to the nature of these visions, maybe you should not take them too seriously.

159562015X|5.0|After reading  \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\", I was intrigued to find what this newer version had to offer.  It is once again a definitive look at how to find your greatest strengths, and maximize them to your advantage both at work, and in everyday life.  The new book provides a somewhat simpler approach, but still with amazing results.  I especially appreciated this chance to reassess my strengths as I am reentering the workforce soon.  Very helpful!

B007SYWFRM|4.0|The only real problem I had was that I couldn't visit friends but I didn't get this app for that so it really doesn't matter to me. The menu bar does disappear but if you go to the in game menu and choose options it pops right back up. This is a fun game that doesn't require too much of a commitment if you don't want it to.

0061537969|5.0|Garth Stein starts off with a cliche. A set in stone 'no-no' of the writing school. NEVER WRITE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF AN ANIMAL. I have a secret. I love cliche's. What I love more than cliche's is watching people use them and use them well. Garth Stein has shattered the rule. This book is simply breathtaking. It is written in the point of view of a dog, but not just any dog. This is a dog of deep philosophical leanings, of good intentions and loyal and trusted and true as all good dogs are and should be. But the story isn't really about Enzo. It's about his owner (Do you see? Do you see? I'm welling up as I write this review!) a race car driver, who marries, has a child, and then watches as the life slowly ebbs from his beautiful and beloved wife's body. While his life shatters, first by tragedy, and then by the selfish machinations of those around him, Enzo remains at his side, sustaining him through the hard times, helping him to persevere, no matter the obstacles. And yet Enzo has some personal motivations of his own. He wishes to be reincarnated. The years in his life are limited. He wishes, as is right, I suppose, for any good and faithful dog to do, to remain with his master always. Only next time, if he is very, very, very good...he will come back as a man.<br /><br />This story, for all its seeming simplicity, is a many layered thing. You have the dog, you have the family, all typical stuff. But then you have the racing, and the end of life issues, and woven together it makes for a brilliant analogy of life and love and loss and triumph. This is not my typical read. Had I picked it up in a store, I would have laid it back down again. But I'm so glad I didn't. It was loaned to me by a neighbour, and I'll always be grateful to her for sharing with me this book, which she took into her heart, and now I have taken into mine.<br /><br />Enzo lives on. Never to be forgotten.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|Why remake a film when the original is great?<br /><br />If found Daniel Craig lacking.<br /><br />I also did not appreciate the gratuitous nudity. The book handled it well. The first version of this film handled it great. In this version, it was gratuitous.
0307594165|5.0|After serving in the army in the Korean War, Frank Money returns home to Lotus, Georgia.  Angry, he suffers from battle fatigue and combat injuries. He is not greeted as a war hero, but with racism due to the color of his skin.<br /><br />Frank searches for his sister Cee as a family friend claims his sibling needs him or will soon be dead.  When he went off to war, Cee was married but her husband left her.  Now some doctor is experimenting on Cee; not if Frank can help it, but will she allow herself to fall back to her childhood haven that her big brother provided.<br /><br />This is a fascinating historical family drama where the respective plights of Frank and Cee are critical but it is the changing relationship between the siblings that make for another great Toni Morrison novel.  Frank leans his fierce protection of Cee never allowed her to mature to the point where she could protect herself.  Now Cee tries to face issues while helping her brother confront the demons that he kept at bay with alcohol.  The insightful storyline makes a strong case that the truth will set you free if you recognize what the truth is though you may never state what you believe the truth is.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

0307951529|5.0|When I first started reading this book I was a tad skeptical. The title seemed to easy. Then I began to see it's larger message. Some businesses might need $100 or $1,000, but anyone can start a business with very little capital. I've already implemented one of the ideas in this book. I'm making small, conscious tweaks to my business so I'm attracting more of my \\"ideal\\" people.<br /><br />If you are looking to start a lifestyle business or even want to create a medium sized business you should read this book. The stories from other business owners will spark creative juices.<br /><br />The most important lesson this book offers is to pay attention to the details. Chris walks the talk. He emailed everyone of his buyers personally. He didn't say how many people that was, but it was way over 100. He created a touchpoint with them to show them he cares. This book show you that you need to pay attention to the little details in your business. You can't ever sit back and let the money come in. You have to keep working to improve your service and products forever. Owning your own business isn't for everyone, but this book is for every person stuck in a job they hate and need that little spark to show them how they can create a plan that frees them from their 9-5.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|The app worked fine for a while, but sometimes it decides not to make any sound when it goes off.  Almost missed a plane (woke up 30 minutes after it was set and saw it was \\"going off\\" with no sound.  My phone was not muted and the volumes were all up (not just the ringer)) and almost missed work a few times because of this app.  Deleted.  Good to use IF you have another backup in place, but then, what's the point.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Ok, I have read all of the reviews including the 1 starts and I say to each his own. I am an intelligent woman and I love to read classic literature. Although this book is not classic literature, it had all of the main elements I look for in a good book FOR ME. #1 I thought about the characters during the day, #2 I could not wait to read at night. The thought of picking up the book to see whap happens next was very nice to think about the get me through a tough day at work, and #3 I was sad when it ended. So, yes, it is not Wuthering Heights. However, does every book have to be? This book was fun and I enjoyed it immensely and plan on reading the next two.

Ana is a very good guitar player as well as she is a very good singer. Ana has allways been a huge Sonny Landreth fan & thats her idol for slide guitar playing & they do a great slide guitar jam together & she can keep up. Great voice,great guitar playing. Right in the pocket on every song & may just be the best female blues guitar player since Bonnie raitt.

0307951529|5.0|First, I read this book in one big sitting - front to back - and that's ALWAYS the sign of an engaging book. :)<br /><br />Chris is a genius in my mind. I've learned countless business lessons from his past writing and books - and The $100 Startup was no different. But what really kept me intrigued where the dozens of stories that Chris included throughout the book. Everything from boutique stores to internet businesses was touched on and all of the core business concepts still applied.<br /><br />Chris taught me that a world-changing and life-changing project is no longer dependent on funding, capital, investors, or crushing risk. You can test, create, and thrive with so few resources compared to the days of old.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who has a strong desire to create a project that has a positive impact on the world - but doesn't have a lot of monetary resources to throw at getting it off the ground.<br /><br />Chris has changed my life several times before - and my guess is The $100 Startup will change the way you live yours. :)
0307951529|5.0|Chris's latest book the $100 Startup is the perfect book for someone with an interesting, useful idea, that wants to turn that idea into profitable business on little capital.  As a current small business owner, I found the book to be both inspiring and filled with useful information. Although not particularly detailed on any one subject, the book covers a wide breadth of topics in just enough detail to make you believe you can also start a successful business doing something you love.  Chris has also paired the book with some create digital downloads made available at 100startup.com. Examples of such forms are a simple 1 page business plan and a 39 step product launch.<br /><br />In the end, readers will still have to do the hard work themselves.  However, those looking for a place to start and who are willing to push fear to the side and follow their dreams will find this book particularly useful.
0553386794|5.0|I was going to rate this book 4/5 but then I realized that if a book is worth a five it should be given a five regardless if it has flaws. I'm not out to prove which books are 'technically' but which books are the best. Therefore this book is a great book and a must read for any adult despite small flaws. Five/Five stars, Ten/Five stars, Twenty/Five stars.<br /><br />The Good:<br />As in my review title I think this book is hands down one of the most intelligent fantasy books I've yet read apart from the Lord of the Rings series. The corruption, the plot twists, the betrayal, the treason, the death, the war, the love, the struggle, the brotherhood, the symbolism, the character detail, the world detail, and the gigantic scope set up for this series is all top notch. It's almost Shakespearean tragedy, in a way, done in a contemporary style. I don't know if I've known in any other modern fantasy so many real and deep characters. I feel like I can empathize most and visualize them completely (even ones without a written point of view). Martin also does an incredible job of keeping the reader on track with the separate story-lines as each comes back to itself after an absence.<br />So on and so forth, all the wonderful comments made by every other five-star reviewer.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Unfortunately there's one thing Martin seems to have a continual habit of doing in this book (and I hope not the rest in the series) which is forgetting his point of view - just for little sentences here and there. I'm almost certain there is at least one time in each chapter where he writes a sentence explaining something (a thought, a look, some detail, etc) that the current point of view could not know. Maybe I'm just picking nits or looking too closely, not looking closely enough, but over and over this writing flaw nagged - never very much, like I said one sentence in a chapter maybe two, but it was consistent through the entire novel.<br />Also small parts of the world I couldn't visualize completely: how do they measure years when seasons are multiple years long? or how does a world have such variable seasonal patterns? Are there miniature seasons that occur to follow a complete annual pattern underneath the greater climate change? Obviously I'm not asking Martin to provide a scientific answer to his world climate, but little things fit easily enough - change in harvests, other celestial bodies, etc that make the world make that much more sense. The former especially can be used merely in passing but provide a major world-explaining detail.<br />The last complaint I have (which other reviewers have mentioned) is that though the bulk of the story is very adult and a major theme seems to be loss of innocence, the sex in a number of cases seems very adolescent. I believe Martin makes an effort to be mature and succeeds at least once or twice (Catelyn's sex scenes and how he writes of Lord's bastards) sometimes it falls flat and tears me out of the story (most often concerning Daenerys). However it is fully possible I hold my standards higher than most.<br /><br />These three details I choose to point out are ultimately negligible in face of what actually makes this book so good. They are nitpicks and can be easily overlooked/forgotten within the same page they occur.<br />Read it, it's worth the money especially if you buy it used. I'm going to read the series in its entirety but I would be just as satisfied having read only this first novel.'t visualize completely: how do they measure years when seasons are multiple years long? or how does a world have such variable seasonal patterns?

B000002MUQ|2.0|Ah yes. The album and era where Eddie thought he'd better grow a goatee. That aside I have mixed feelings about this album and to be honest I rarely play it. I do like 'Feelin' and 'Take me back' and 'Seventh Seal' has a bit of epic about it but I think the band had gone a little stale at this stage.<br /><br />Still a lot better than most of the new crap out there, but for me the worst (least best) album of the Hagar era. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good game. like how the option to buy gold is there but not necessary. a lot like the Garfield defense game. wish that character wasn't so squishy
0446572993|4.0|I am a big David Baldacci fan and the plot of this book sounded terrific to me, so I made sure to get it the day it came out.  It was definitely entertaining and worth while reading, but it was not his best work (my personal favorite is \\"Deliver Us From Evil\\").  There was actually a point near the end, right before the climax, where I was getting slightly bored and just wanted the book to be over.  I had some of the pieces together, but not all of them before the climax and loved the ending -- that made it worth while.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was surprised how easy it was to setup and use. Being able to use the Kindle Fire to view my desktop is great when away from home. I would recommend this apt to anyone who has files on another computer and needs to see them from anywhere.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book can be disturbing, but a page turner at the same time.  Found sadistic sexual descriptions, behavior disturbing.  Beautiful young woman succumbs to demands of psychologically troubled man that has wealth, extreme good looks, and demented way of thinking.  She allows herself to be sexually pleasured but pays the price of being tortured, physically abused, and owned.  She is a sex slave.  I will finish this book but doubt if i will go on to books 2 & 3.
B00192IV9U|4.0|As much as I wanted to love this out of the box, I only liked it a lot.  This album felt like it was displaced, meaning, this recording should have been released anywhere between OFF THE WALL and DANGEROUS.  Michael's dance tracks sounded like you would've heard on the BAD or DANGEROUS album, but the slower tempo songs...now those were the winners in my book.  They had that flavor that only he could have brought to the table, and I enjoyed those immensely.  Those songs were flashbacks to SHE'S OUT OF MY LIFE, HUMAN NATURE, and BUTTERFLIES.  All in all, like I stated before, it wasn't the \\"end all and be all\\" of his career, but as a final release, it was a fitting tribute to a very talented man.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|Ever spent time reading a multi book set and found yourself thinking, `what a f-ing waste of time this was!'.....Well, I finished Game of Thrones Books 1 through 4 only to find that the writer feels he needs two more books to bring the story to closure.  I am so pissed.<br /><br />This is an example of one book that desperately needs an editor. There are too many extraneous story lines with total ignorance of some real plums of drama available.<br /><br />The HBO series I think is doing an excellent job of telling the story but My fear right now is the writers will try to follow the book and which makes caricatures of some of the main characters.<br /><br />Just a few thoughts - and don' t read this if you plan on reading the books, or feel it may spoil the series...<br /><br />Jaime develops from an arrogant ass hole into a full blown complex character who is learning life frailities. His future looks interesting.<br /><br />Wish I could say the same about Cersei - by Book 4 she becomes a caricature, and its so disappointing because she started as such a complex juicy character.  She is the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland - Paint the Roses Red or Off with her head...<br /><br />Tywin Lannister is another opportunity to create this complex character who changes before the reader's eyes. Having the Imp shoot him dead with a crossbow is a ridiculous waste.  He should have been the one to figure out that his twins were doing the horizontal mambo and producing all these blond moppets.<br /><br />Losing his character in Book 4 makes the eventual story conclusion lacking a layer of complexity - he represents the old line and the Dragons represent the rebirth of the Kingdom's origins...The actor who is playing Tywin is a real gem and I will hate to see him go if the writers follow the books.  He never gets to kill anyone and say `Lannisters always pay their debts'....A jewel of a moment that I kept expecting to read..never came..<br /><br />The author seems really in love with gore and random killing to the point it becomes a major motivation to create characters simply for the opportunity to kill them off later...The book keeps setting up killings with no character development so you feel nothing for the people who are killed.  Gratuitous gore. Oh boy...<br /><br />The Red Wedding? Really...just stupid and totally unrealistic given the characters...A guy leading a troop of 20,000 goes to his `not Father in law' to apologize? Doesn't try to buy him off or marry off one of his two younger brothers? Totally unbelieveable... and stupid.<br /><br />Aryssa, Lady Catelyn's sister is another example. Why was she in the book? Her whole story line is just to support Jon Arryn's original finding of the incest line and then she gets killed by Littlefinger right in front of Sansa...Its was almost an Acme Cartoon moment. He pushes off the Aeryrie and blames the singer..I half expected Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunner to pop up. Beep Beep.  So I had bought Book 5 thinking it was the end, but no there will be a book 7.  Someone bail this guy out. He needs an editor...I returned it and asked for a refund. I am doing the same with the Books 1-4. So incredibly disappointed.<br /><br />Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit created an entire world and complex characters etc.  The rule in publishing should be do it in 4 books or else...in love with gore and random killing to the point it becomes a major motivation to create characters simply for the opportunity to kill them off later...The book keeps setting up killings with no character development so you feel nothing for the people who are killed.

0345803485|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I added the books to my Kindle but after finishing the first 2 books in record time I have done nothing but RAVE about them! I saw the author on the Today Show and decided to read the books based simply on her interview; VERY glad I did.  I am a very open minded woman and had no problem dealing with the sexual aspect of the books but definately think people should be aware of the content.  The relationship, love and story line are captivating and so easy to get lost in; I honestly haven't been able to stop reading.  My only issue is what I'm going to do when I finish the last book:(
B004EWFUQY|4.0|The Dukan Diet helped me get back my physique for the summer.  I didn't have a lot of weight to lose -- maybe just 5 lbs -- but I wanted to reveal my abs again and lose the holiday weight gain before going to the beach this summer.  I did the Pure Protein phase for only 3 days, then the Cruise Phase for 10 days or so, and now I'm on the Consolidation Phase (been about 4 weeks).  It's been hard and I've slipped up a few times, but I'm not eating near as many carbs like Pasta and Rice and I'm not drinking too often.  I'm much prouder of the way I look right now.<br /><br />The Dukan Muffins are good treats and I add a little yogurt and small amount of chopped apple or blueberries to them but not so much Stevia because I don't like the taste of artificial sweeteners.  Tried to make the 'Chocolate Chip Cookies' and it was a disaster because the cookies just baked into a runny mess that I couldn't get off the cookie sheet.  I discovered I love Sparkling Mineral Water, especially the Lemon flavor, and that has been a nice treat during the diet along with coffee and tea.<br /><br />The book has a lot of Filler in it, and would do better to get straight to the diet but I suppose you can just jump ahead to that.  I didn't need to spend two days reading the book to understand the diet but I suppose you can start with the Pure Protein phase while you're reading and dreaming of making Dukan Muffins and eating vegetables!<br /><br />It's a tough diet and I've been far from perfect on it but it's helped me change some habits for the better.  I already ate healthy and avoided fried and fatty foods, but this has helped me move away from lots of heavy carbs like Pasta, Cereal, and Rice.

B000MV8ABS|5.0|Originally I saw Phantasm as a ten year old at the drive-in in 1979 with the second movie being Prophecies. It was a van load of us, three adults and two kids. Everyone was mortified by this movie.<br />Us kids were told to close our eyes a few times during the sex scenes but we pretty much saw everything else. The adults screamed almost as much as the kids.<br />Not a joke, I was too traumatized by Phantasm to ever eat butterscotch pudding again until very recently when I finally managed to love the movie starting in 2010. I watched it one other time on VHS in the 80s but it still scared me horribly and I could barely watch the tv while the others enjoyed it.<br />Us kids and another had an unexpected run in at a video store with Don Coscarelli standing behind the counter there selling and signing DVDs of Phantasm. I thought the guy worked there and was one step toward asking him about a certain movie I was looking for until someone took a flash photo of him. He politely told the fellow not to take any more. I asked the others who was he and then we all realized who.<br />We bought a Phantasm DVD and he autographed it.<br />Afterwards watched the movie literally within two hours of the encounter but I couldn't bring myself to watch anymore than the first ten minutes. I was too scared too. This was around 2003. In 2010 I finally watched it fully through again after over twenty years since the VHS encounter.<br />Now I've probably watched it at least 10 times. I have now seen all the sequels and really love how Phatasm 4 uses a lot of cut scenes from the original.<br />I literally didn't make the connection until 2010 that Coscarelli directed Kenny and Company, Phantasm, and Beastmaster; all movies I seen in the theater and drive-in. WOW.<br />I look forward to seeing John Dies At The End this year in the theater and then Phantasm 5 in 2013 or 2014 in time for the 35th anniversary.<br />Phantasm itself should be put into the Library of Congress archives with the other films. Why? Because as terrified of it as I was for so long, I now watch it with utter fascination at its effectiveness as a horror while liking the relationships of the brothers and their buddy Reggie. It seems Reggie and Jody bonded even more after their \\"trio\\" with Tommy ended before the audience got to know him. The new trio of Mike, Jody, and Reggie is so dynamic that when the end is near you don't want it to end. Phantasm 3 and 4 help keep it going but the innocence of the first movie is gone from them. If a bluray comes out hopefully it could do what Ridley Scott did with Blade Runner on bluray, put cut scenes and added shots into the movie for a directors cut/Phan cut. This could be released by itself or side by side with Phantasm 5. Either way I will always keep the DVD playing till the bluray arrives.r films. Why?

B001ILFUD2|5.0|Great movie,  The grand children love this.  It is watched over and over.  I enjoy watching it with them. Well worth the money for such an enjoyable movie.
0345803493|4.0|The second in the series does not disappoint. Once again, not for the faint of heart, very sexual. Aside from all the kinkiness, pretty good story line. I must ask though, what is it with these books where one women is surrounded by beautiful men who all want her and she just doesn't understand why? Still yet, for a fictional work it was a fun read. Looking forward to finishing the series.
0060254920|5.0|I have recently heard about Maurice Sendak's unexpected passing today, and let me say that we have lost a true voice in the world of illustrated literature. His powerful art has shown us another world of a child's imagination, and his unforgettable classic \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" has put a special place in millions of readers' hearts for almost 50 years.<br />In the story, we follow the mischievous rumpus of Max and after angering his mother, he is sent to bed without supper, and then sees his room transform into a completely different but whimsical world. After finding a boat with his name on it, Max journeys to an island, where he encounters the wild things and then when he tames them by telling them to be still, they are frightened and impressed, and they make him \\"king of all wild things\\", and Max lead them in a wild rumpus that they all find enjoyable. But then after that, Max starts to feel lonely and quickly loses interest in being king and want to returns to his home.<br />I read this book as a little kid and i definitely enjoyed the story and its dazzling illustrations, and now i see it as a wonderful classic for anyone young and old. No matter what, Maurice Sendak will definitely live down as a true legend for his beloved masterpiece.
0670023329|5.0|Some events in the book are brutal and downright disgusting. I think most of us associate prison camps and harsh brutality with WWII, but this book brings to light that those types of prison camps still exist in today's world.
B007SGM084|2.0|I understand that Amazon is in it for the money, but come on!!!! I am in complete agreement with everyone else-WHY charge more for the download version when you can go to Walmart and pay ALOT less for these books. Does Amazon need to make their \\"two-cents\\" before the movie is released? I always thought Amazon was a reasonable company until I went to download these books and found out what the price was!!!!!!! I think I'll just what until the hype wears off and MAYBE, price being a HUGE factor, I might download the books and see what the big deal was. And you know the movie IS NOT going to be as good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000P0TZK6|5.0|Excellent movie with alot of twist and a surprising ending. Love Love Love Johnny Depp and all his movies. Excellent actor who is very versatile in his work. Man of many talents. Enjoyed this suspense movie very much. Highly recommend this if you haven't seen. You won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|If this had been my first Lee Child novel with Jack Reacher as the subject, I wouldn't bother reading another.  The airport scene--really?  It makes it a much shorter read when you skip over some of the pages.  Just cannot recommend this one.
B005LAIGNC|1.0|There are so many things wrong with this movie, it's difficult to know where to start.<br />First, the real Tuskegee Airmen were competent pilots who followed orders. The protagonist is competent, but arrogant. Like Mavrick from Top Gun. I wanted to root for him, but I didn't care for him at all. I ended up caring more for the comic relief character, reminiscent of Jar Jar Binks.<br />So, right off the bat, the dialogue is bad. Really bad. So bad, that fan movies made by teenagers about Star Wars made in some kid's basement probably had better dialogue than this movie. The dialogue, especially from the \\"good\\" actors sounds forced and unbelievable. Most lines are useless, simply retelling of what happened, like \\"I've been shot!\\", just to make sure you're aware of what's happening. Other lines have no real reason for being there, other than to give you a sense of atmosphere.<br />The acting is simply cringe worthy. I never thought I'd see Cuba Gooding, Jr or Terrance Howard give a poor performance, but they did. Most actors in the movie, most of whom I had never seen before, are extremely void of any depth. The only one who gave a good performance was Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad), even he is wooden and one dimensional. I kept wondering what the point of his character was, other than to reiterate multiple times of what the majority of the Armed Service higher-ups thought of Black pilots.<br />The CG is beautiful looking, but the movie relies too heavily on it. Most of the scenes that use heavy CG don't do it in an interesting way. Here's a plane. Here's a plane shooting at it. Here's another plane. The explosions are the most exciting thing, since the fire and smoke billow like fluid and it's the greatest thing about this movie. But you realize after seeing it over and over again that it's meant to portray death and you feel a little guilty deriving so much pleasure from it.<br />Oh, and of course there is a love story shoved in there for good measure. Some might say it's a good way for the audience to identify with the characters, to raise the stakes of their heroic actions. I say rubbish. Love stories are trite and overdone. And it feels doubly so in this movie.<br />A lot of the scenes are pointless. You get that there is rampant racism and how they are being stabbed in the back by their own Armed Forces. But why must you keep showing it? I get it. Move on. Let me get to know the characters more. Oh, now it's more about the couple in love. Great.<br />And I almost forgot about \\"the bad guy\\". The stereotypical antagonist who has no emotional depth, and no real purpose other than to be defeated. He's there. It's disheartening to see that kind of lack of originality in today's movies.<br />The most annoying thing about this movie? The heroic sounding dialogue. You know, the kind from Brave Heart. It's all over the place. It's in the beginning, in the middle, in the end. When you think you wouldn't hear another line, boom, someone says it randomly. It would be fine at the end of the movie, but not throughout.<br />Bottom line, this movie is bursting at the seams with stereotypes, lame acting, poor dialogue, pointless plot points, and an ending so contrived, it dawns on you that every movie George Lucas has been involved with in the last 20 years has been an utter disaster.say it's a good way for the audience to identify with the characters, to raise the stakes of their heroic actions.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|MOVIE REVIEW #31 : \\" The Avengers \\"<br /><br />Wow! The best film of the year to date! Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Toy Story) did what every screenwriter and director should do in all movies - make the audience care about the characters and as a result - we'll follow them anywhere and believe everything!.<br /><br />This movie has action, adventure, drama, mystery, intrigue, gadgets, technology and two extremely important aspects....heart and humor! Starting from droplets of all the other films before it (Iron Man. The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) this film tells the story of the brother of Thor (and a mystery off-world villain) Loki -  played deliciously creative by Tom Hiddleston (Warhorse, Midnight In Paris, Thor)  plotting an evil destruction of the Planet Earth.<br /><br />Thanks to the incredibly funny and sharp performance of Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, The Incredibles) as the S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Furry leader along with another character (like Jacksons') sprinkled though all the previous films, Agent Coulson played succinctly by Clark Greg (The Shield, Mr. Poppers Penguins, Thor) - who both got the Avengers Team together to battle this deadly enemy who obviously an egomaniacal madman!<br /><br />What great about this film is the believability of all the super heroes and their alter egos. Top of the performances were Robert Downey, Jr.(Chaplin, Sherlock Holmes, Due date) as Ironman and the hysterical ego drive alter ego Tony Stark and Chris Evens (Fantastic Four, The Losers, Push) as Captain America/Steve Rogers. Their chemistry and their electrifying  performances made for exciting drama and comedy every time they were on screen.<br /><br />And - Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek 2009, Thor, Cabin In the Woods) reprising his intensely innocent yet strong performance of the Demi-God - Thor. He wields his hammer like never before. In fact one of the more memorable scenes involves a fight of basically egos with Ironman and Thor only to be broken up by Captain America with some humorous results!<br /><br />The More subtle performance of Mark Ruffalo (Shutter Island, 13 Going On 30, Zodiac) as The Hulk was a great contrast and motivation to the Avengers Team! And who know The Hulk could be so so so funny! Real...but still funny. Another starlit moment can be given to the added intrigue of The Black Widow/Natassia and her dark past to the team as cleverly played by Scarlett Johansson (The Prestige, The Island, Iron man 2).<br /><br />For me there was one `throw-away' character The Hawkeye/Clint played by Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Town, MI4:Ghost Protocol). Not really vital to the story or the team...but he was honestly performed and he did have a few cool gadgets. Other characters returned like Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Pots and Paul Betteny as JARVIS both the assistants of Billionaire Tony Stark (although one is a computer).<br /><br />The movie was edited extremely well...you can follow all the action and the Alan Silvestri (Back To the Future, Forest Gump, Night At The Museum) score gets you pumped up and going. Again this is a greta fun and funny film for the whole family. Technically up to speed that you'll be amazed at the gadgets and you'll never be taking your eyes of the screen! Over $200 million in its first weekend. I think it will be around for a while!involves a fight of basically egos with Ironman and Thor only to be broken up by Captain America with some humorous results!<br /><br />The More subtle performance of Mark Ruffalo (Shutter Island, 13 Going On 30, Zodiac) as The Hulk was a great contrast and motivation to the Avengers Team!

0307951529|5.0|Chris writes a book that will help people who don't have a lot of capital but have the drive to succeed in this new economy. He says it will take effort but it will be well worth if you desire to own your business.  This really helpful for those of us who are in life situation where we need some extra income and don't have a lot of money to test a bunch of different ideas to see if they succeed.  I would recommend this book to those who have some sense on how to use a computer and who have always wanted to have their business. Chris will walk you through a blueprint to do this.  You won't be disappointed.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I got this knife to be a bushcraft/survival knife. I wanted strength, durability, and versatility. I believe I've found that knife. Handle and blade fit in my hand nicely(I have fairly large hands). The wider blade helps when griping for tight work. The fire steel groovy is a great feature as well. The two down sides of this knife are the sheath (complete crap) and the scales. Now my guess for why they put the cheap sheath and scales on this excellent knife is to keep the knife cheap and to give the buyer the option to personalize. At 60 bucks you can't beat this blade. I'll get a custom sheath and make my own wooden scales and this knife will do me good for a long time to come. Thank you Ka-Bar, Mr. Becker, and Amazon for the great product and fantastic service.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm the kind of person who avoid sad and depressing books when I'm not in an extremely happy and relaxed mood, which I'm not right now...so I was going to pass on this book when I found out that it's about some teenagers with cancer. I mean, come on...we all have our own real life challenges and problems, who have time to read about some 16-year-olds complaining about life being unfair, unhappy and unfulfilled? However, my daughter was introduced to Green by reading his \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\", and really liked him, so I promised her to read along. I was so glad I read this book. It has just become one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />The story was narrated by Hazel, a 16-year-old girl with progressive thyroid cancer that somehow weakened her lungs so she required an oxygen tank constantly. She met Augustus (Gus) Waters, a previous basketball star that lost a leg to bone cancer, at a support group. Well, of course, they were immediately attracted to each other.<br /><br />The story is not about cancer, not quite. It's about love, loss, pain, hope, fear, struggle, friends, family...everything that is dear or not so dear to us. Both Hazel and Gus are mature for their age, very wise, humorous and a tad cynical. Reading their exchanges and thoughts was such an enjoyable experience, poetic at times.<br /><br />\\"They always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is a not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.\\"<br /><br />I'm not going to reveal the ending, or the middle here...which I usually don't like to do in my reviews. I will just say that anyone with a heart will definitely get something out of this book, whether if it's joy, pain or a big hole in that heart...
B001HN69B8|5.0|I watched this movie half a dozen times. Alone, with my friends, with author comments, again and again.<br />It is a great movie, and Terry Gilliam is one of the greatest movie makers in this world.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After all the hoopla over the Hunger Games movie, I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I read it really quickly and was enthralled all the way through.  The premise of this story is horrible, but it is still a page turner that I couldn't put down.<br />I have also read the second story \\"Catching Fire,\\" and am now reading the third part \\"Mockingjay.\\"  I've heard from friends that the book is better than the movie, but I still can't wait to see the movie.
B004B32532|5.0|This is a passionate, powerful movie by Jodorowsky; I don't think many people ever even heard of it.<br />I recommend it with all my heart. A great movie.
B001E45XT4|2.0|We've owned similarly styled headphones before, even from this brand, and really liked them. I don't know if the pair we got this time were just defective, or what, but they had no bass at all, so we had to return them. On the plus side, though, they were pretty comfortable.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|A must have soundtrack. Great movie, outstanding tracks. When you hear it, makes you live the movie again. Nice price from amazon.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|My son is in love with angry birds.  If he had his choice, he would play it every day.  I had no idea what the appeal was until I played myself, and I must admit I got a little addicted to the regular version.  My son could not wait to try the Seasons version.  He's pretty much mastered the regular.  This one is much more tricky - he normally gets stuck on the first one or two levels.  The scenery is neat, and I like that this one really makes you think and plot out a strategy for how to use each bird.  We haven't had any trouble with freezing or the ads on the Kindle Fire as yet - the free version has been working great.
B002APU580|5.0|This book inspired me to create my own novel with 1800s pieces in it. I love the romance and the story. It is the best \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" I have ever watched, and it actually has a good looking Mr. Darcy in it. ^_^
B006MW3VC4|5.0|This series was wonderfully portrayed from each prespective of the wealthy and those that took care of them. It involved you in their daily lives and you lived their trials and tribulations as though you knew each of them and felt their emotions in a very personal way. The cast was excellent and drew you in immediatly.<br />I can't wait to see the new series..

0393080269|5.0|One small consolation for the current economic pantaraxia is that many very helpful, intelligible and readable books on economics are being written and, it even appears, read. Whether or not you agree with me that we the democratic public have an outright duty to try to understand the economic issues we are invited to vote on, there is no denying that we are being given the opportunity. Ruchir Sharma comes with impressive credentials as the head of Emerging Market Equities at Morgan Stanley. That makes him knowledgeable, in addition to which he is a practising journalist, most publicly in Newsweek, and that has made his writing a model of clarity. What this book is about is economic growth. It is not about the question whether such growth is a good idea, although I suppose it is assumed to be some kind of good thing for the most part. Spurts of growth funded with easy money are not commended, but Brazilian-style constipation with growth opportunities neglected and postponed gets the thumbs-down as well. Subject to rational limits like these, the nations that Sharma inspects are assessed by their growth potential. Growth is also never asked to justify itself as an alternative to, say, freedom or social justice, and this approach at least makes for simplicity.<br /><br />This is not to say that Sharma makes the mistake of trying to view economics in isolation from politics. For me, economics is a form of sociology - the study of how people behave en masse in the financial sphere. I can't foist this view on Sharma, but he says nothing that leads me to change it. Indeed, his political attitudes are a breath of fresh air in that stifling miasma of prejudice. You can see what I mean from the economies that get the best ratings from him. South Korea comes off best, and I suppose that is nothing surprising. China is another of his prizewinners, and before you say that that is nothing surprising either please be aware that Sharma repeatedly refuses to give any dutiful bonus-marks to democratic forms of government. On the contrary, he says that China proves that a command economy can do the economic thing just as well as democracy can. In this he is not airing some personal political prejudice - Vietnam by contrast is paraded as a miserable instance of how not to do things in a statist and authoritarian way. Back to China for a moment, let me say again that Sharma keeps his blinkers on, and in my opinion rightly. He is strictly talking about economic growth. China has not got round to a welfare state for one thing, which is a basic requirement of western democratic socialism. Deng's priority was - get the economic growth bit right first. That gets him high marks from Mr Sharma, and human rights are not even mentioned.<br /><br />Of the emerging markets discussed, China happens to be one of the three that I have visited. Three weeks there in 2009, even in three widely different environments, only left me wishing I had world enough and time to know China better but grateful that I had been spared to see it at all. However on my way there I stopped off for a couple of days in Dubai, and I have a story about that which might interest you. This was late May 2009, and I had no wish to gawp at a bunch of hotels in Dubai City but rather to see the country, which after all is only about 100 miles wide. Bear in mind Sharma's context here, which is the role of rumour and (dis)information in creating economic reality, even temporarily. (All economic reality is only temporary, and that is another theme running through this book). My hotel driver's route out of Dubai City was via the `back door' and the sight I saw took my breath away, especially after the ruling sheikh had just assured us that all was well. It was like a scene out of The Day the World Stood Still. The overhead power cables were the biggest I ever saw, and so were the construction vehicles. Except that the vehicles were drawn up in inert lines along the roadside. We passed villages with rows of shops obviously put up to cater for the construction crews, and these were deserted. How I might have affected the world's stock exchanges if I had actually taken the photos I wanted to take and given them to the press I shall never know. Caution reminded me that my driver might report me to heaven knows whom, but I knew the truth about Dubai a few days before the world in general did.<br /><br />The discussion of Brazil is thoughtful but I missed one element in it. I have family there these days and I can certainly endorse what Sharma says about the rise in living costs since 2006. The story comes down to - Brazil is uniquely self-sufficient in commodities but lacks a proper transport infrastructure. Even a visitor knows that, but what will be the effect of the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016? They have to do SOMETHING to improve mobility, but even if it is not all it might be, will it unstop the Brazilian Blockage?<br /><br />The other interesting discussion concerns Turkey. Erdogan's  government is slowly unpicking the secular constitution and recognising the plain fact that they have an Islamic population. Cue panic in certain western quarters, and this chapter, even more than the one on China with its placid recognition that democracy is not some be-all or end-all, is a major contribution to rational thought and debate that should be compulsory reading.<br /><br />Just one oddity: is Sharma really crediting American growth between 1929 and 1950 to Hayek? I thought there had been some New Deal and a World War in that time. Nor was I aware that Japan's support for tottering firms was Keynesian. Perhaps I misread those sentences. Otherwise great stuff.ith rows of shops obviously put up to cater for the construction crews, and these were deserted.

1401937268|3.0|This review is only based on my opinion and preference.  First of all I love most the artwork in the deck as I have all of Doreen's decks, some of the artwork I am not particulary fond of.<br /><br />However, I introduced myself to Tarot 30 years ago on the beginning of my spiritual journey.  I began with the Rider/Waite deck.  Even though the deck seems simplistic, I began to learn more about the deck than it's general meanings and more about it's history and symbolism contained in almost every card.  The symbolism may be in the direction someone is looking, a symbol on a garment, the numbers of points on a specific object, the positioning of a cup or wand, etc... The deck contains astrological, Kabbalah, and numeroligical symbolism. I met a very gifted woman shortly after, who told me she read the cards intuitively.  An example \\"The Devil\\" is more than just Ego to me, but also Choice, if you notice in the Rider Deck the devil has a man and woman chained, but they actually have the freedom to remove those chains.  As I began to read them differently the symbolism popped a little more, it's as if the symbols spoke to the subconsious and the subconscious connected to the intuitive to put it together.<br /><br />  I do not read professionally and haven't actually read in years, the tarot was a learning tool and guidepost on my spiritual journey.  There are some beautiful decks that have come out since the Rider/Waite, I have been looking for a new deck with updated artwork on & off for years, but haven't found one speak the same to me at the same depth symbolically, or either I am put off by the artwork.<br /><br />  Because of the beautiful artwork that is in Doreen's other Oracle decks, which I have used and enjoyed frequently, I was hoping I could work with this deck like the Rider.  I find some symbolism in some of the cards, however, I feel like much of it is lost.  Some of the artwork is hard to see as well and key figures or suit symbols are subdued or far in the background.  Like a previous reviewer I don't necessarily like the meanings written on the cards, however, I would not be able to pick up the meaning otherwise.<br /><br /> I have used my tarot deck differently than I have used the Angel Oracles put out by Doreen.  With the tarot I try to read by the imagery along with the general meanings I may have remembered without trying to refer to a book (although I do refer) I was hoping to be able to use these in the same manner, but so far have found that I need to read the wording on the cards that explain the general meaning.<br /><br />I do like the way the meanings for the Angel Tarot cards are worded and I believe there are things I can learn from the the deck.  I also like the reference to the tarot over the other oracles, I think you can put together a more detailed reading.  I will keep the deck and continue to work with it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have done nothing but sit on the couch or lie on my bed for over twelve continuous hours with this book. The world outside died to a murmur as The Raven's Shadow captured my senses so totally that I cancelled a dentist's appointment today just so that I wouldn't have to break with the story.  This is the undoubtedly the best fantasy book I have read this year and I am still a little dazed after concluding it.<br /><br />I will not describe the premise, the story or its actors. Such an engaging work should be read with no foreknowledge or preconceptions. I am looking forward to reading more of Mr Ryan's books. Something tells me he is going to be a very popular fantasy writer.

I am on page 200 and simply can read no more!  It is SO REPETITIVE and I am still waiting for the storyline to develop halfway through!  It is killing me to not finish this book, but I think in the end it will be more painful to try to get through the next 200 pages.

I was playing just fine, then it removed the \\"free\\" dollars you receive when you install the game. Also, my kindle fire was going down to 15% battery life quite regularly, so I checked into the applications.  This game allows your Kindle to remain \\"live\\", therefore battery decreases quickly.<br /><br />Too many bugs!  Although I like the game, it is not worth my time!!!
1416550534|3.0|Intrigue, romance, discovery, scandal.  This book has a serving of delicious plot points.  It wet my appetite and sustained me, but didn't quite leave me craving for a return visit.  I think this may have been due to my listening to the audio rather than physically reading the book.<br /><br />There were beautiful time changes from our lead character's present day into her past, but the transitions were a bit funny in the audiobook where I think they may have been seamless in the written form.  Sometimes I found it difficult to determine if I was with the character in present or reliving her memories from the past.  The present day into the past method of story telling reminded me greatly of Water for Elephants, but didn't carry off as smoothly for me.<br /><br />There was enough intrigue in the plot to keep me guessing right up until the big reveal, which happened much later than I had anticipated (definitely a good thing!).  I cared for the lead characters and was invested, but don't know that I'll be thinking about this book in years to come.<br /><br />I'm happy to have experience the book and encourage others who enjoy historical fiction to give it a whirl.
0439023491|5.0|Often a sequel can disappoint.  It may lack that surge of energy that the newness of that first book contains.  This doesn't happen here.  I couldn't wait to continue the story because firstly I loved the first book and secondly stories do continue.  We can't just press a magic button and evil disappears forever.  We have to take action, look around and see the truths of our lives.  'Catching Fire' does not let us down.  It is full of action as the consequences start to fall into place once the games in the arena are over but the ones played by power hungry politicians continue.  Again our heroine, a child really in years if not life experience, finds herself and the people she cares for in danger.  We follow her journey through her thoughts and are brought to tears at times at what unfolds in front of her because the element of reality continues in the beautiful and flowing style of Suzanne Collins.  To repeat something I said in the first book's review, this may have been written for young adults but there is much to satisfy a much, much wider audience.  Don't miss the opportunity to read a really good book! As for me, I have already downloaded and started reading the last book of this powerful trilogy.

0439023521|5.0|The secret to a reader believing in something is all in the writing.  If the author uses finesse and imagination to create a world different to our own and includes elements we can relate to, then when we are caught up in fiction we are so involved we forget to question what is real or what is not.  Those elements are there and we find ourselves thinking that if we don't change things in this world now then we may end up in that other world. It is a fine line at times between fiction and reality.  Did I love this book?  Absolutely! It is brutal and yet poignant and we live and breathe every step of the games with Katniss.  There is so much in all the characters that connects to our daily lives.  Fear for our families well-being both in the present and the future, responsibility, the desire to flee from unpleasantness and the ability to find courage under incredible circumstances.  The book has a freshness in its story, a capitvating style in which to display it and contains a down to earth approach in plot and syntax that is totally fascinating in its ability to be believable.  I know it was written for young adults but this book transcends age, so much so I had already downloaded the second book before I was half-way with this one. Wow! Read it.

B0016492BW|5.0|If you like this movie, or if you haven't seen this movie, or if you've seen copies of this on DVD somewhere, please just buy this. The DVD releases are just terrible in picture and audio quality, this is so far and above them. The movie is still very grainy, which is a GREAT thing because the DVD was so horribly compressed that the picture comes off as large smudges. Detail is exquisite in this release, and the audio track has gone through similar improvements. Clarity is far greater, louder moments like swords clangs and explosions come off much crisper with no clipping. The original mono track is included as well, which again still sounds better than what was released on DVD.<br /><br />Honestly, if you've ever thought about seeing this movie you can't do it any other way. If you've never thought about seeing this movie, you're a bloody fool and you'd do right to watch it as soon as possible.

Rise of the Lycans being the weakest link, I have to say that the Underworld films are hands down the best Scifi/horror films ever made. This one is no exception. Plot twists, character development, great action scenes, and top notch actors. Here's a little tip, if reviewers don't like a movie, go see it. They have thier own agendas when it comes to films.I pray they make another film. If you truely love vampires and werewolves that don't \\"Sparkle\\", watch this series.  cheers

1400031001|4.0|A few pages into \\"Any Human Heart\\" and I was thinking, why are British writers so good at this particular form of the novel?  As good as this novel is, it certainly possesses strong echos of Waugh's \\"Sword of Honor\\", Le Carre's \\"Secret Pilgrim\\", Barnes' \\"Sense of of an Ending? and even Hollinghurst's \\"The Stranger's Child\\" (and probably scores of other excellent journal-cum-novel writing.)<br /><br />I thought the great strength of this book by William Boyd was the sweep of time that the protagonist Logan Mountstuart is writing about and the totally audacious inclusion of fictional encounters with some of the most notorious figures of the 20th Century.  Interestingly, their interactions with Mountstuart do no particular honor to either character and, in fact, leave the reader with the general impression that very few of these famous figures were very trustworthy, intelligent or worthy of taking out for a drink.  As to Mountstuart himself, he is not portrayed as remotely admirable, proactive or honorable through much of the book.  He is most often driven by his libido and/or love of beauty and comfort, which leads him into myriad personal betrayals and scrapes.  These eventually reduce him to a more honorable life of poverty and basics.  In his last years, he is allowed by the author to become a happier more introspective person who finally tries to do the right thing for others at some cost to himself.<br /><br />If the protagonist's life is often dodgy, full of bad choices and occasionally downright sleazey, author Boyd cleverly brings everything back from the brink for a wonderful ending, leaving the reader with much to ponder about the lead character and much to admire in the way he has woven his way through 85 years of history in what he calls, \\"the yo-yo of a life\\".

B005UBNKZG|5.0|For quite a while I avoided the AMD Bulldozer line of CPUs, because of the very mixed reviews they received. However I finally gambled on my suspicion that most of the complaints were rooted in using an inadequate cooler.<br /><br />When I first installed the FX 8120 in a Gigabyte mobo ((990FXA-UD3 rev. 1.1) it wouldn't post much less boot. After saying a prayer to Ganesh, I held my breath and shorted the cmos posts in the hope of defaulting to something that would work. That trick did work. I have had no further difficulty posting, booting or in any BIOS setting (within reason!). No BSODs or hangs or other malfunction occurred in 3 days of testing, using XP X64 and a typical assortment of browsers and video and image processing and file manipulation software.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that the FX 8120 is easily tamed by a Cooler Master Hyper 212  Plus HSF with two 120 mm \\"sickle blade\\" fans (at full power) sandwiching the heatsink. Using AMD Overdrive to force 100% load on each core simultaneously (using \\"stability test\\"), with 10% overclock, no core temp ever exceeded 45 C during a two-hour trial. I don't believe that longer testing would show any further temperature rise - the 45C max was achieved quickly and never seemed to vary significantly thereafter.<br /><br />It appears that the FX 8120 has quite a bit of headroom w/r overclocking, however we do not ordinarily OC our machines. We will be buying more FX 8120's when they are on sale.

I have go to phrases that are in my head when I'm surprised, disappointed, angry, shocked.<br /><br />I read a lot and am not easy to impress but I was impressed by this book.  Yes, there is some rather kinky sex in it but that isn't what the book is about.  The book is about the why behind the kinky sex and the question \\"can a tiger changes his stripes under the right circumstances?\\".<br /><br />The author does an excellent job of developing characters that you can empathize or sympathise with.  The sub is the strong one in the book and the dom is the broken one.  I was amazed by this book.<br /><br />On to book two.
B0079R8KO0|3.0|I have 2 cases for my Kindle Fire. This one was given to me; the other I purchased. This one is priced higher, but I like the less expensive case I purchased for about half the price. Function wise, I like them both about the same. Besides cost, the other reasons I prefer this one less than the [[ASIN:B005QJR346 MiTAB Genuine Black Napa Leather Flip Open Book Style Carry Case Cover for the Kindle Fire 7 Inch Tablet By Amazon Android 3.2]] is that it does not have inner pockets / slots. Also, the MiTAB case is leather. So, this case is good, but (for me) not the best option available. My number one suggestion is look around, you can most likely get a similar case for less money.

B002RKSXJG|5.0|This book first reached my \\"to-read\\" pile after I finished reading the Preston/Child mystery novel, [[ASIN:0446612758 Brimstone (Pendergast #5)]]. The mystery writing duo acknowledged that one of their characters was their homage to Collins and what is considered to be the first true mystery novel: The Woman in White. That curiosity deepened after reading Dan Simmons' [[ASIN:B005EP26IK Drood]], where Simmons presents Wilkie Collins as his narrator in telling the tale of Charles Dickens' last days, and also presenting the two writers in a sort of Salieri-Mozart type of relationship. And when I finally sat down to read it, I found myself quite surprised how much I did enjoy it!<br /><br />19th century novels are not everyone's cup of tea - although it does seem with so many being free on the Kindle and through websites like Project Gutenberg and Google Books, that more people are at least giving these books a fresh try. And this book is long - with sections that surely be entirely edited out under the thumb of a modern editor. Still, it is an important novel and one that deserves a wider audience than many other \\"classics.\\" Oh, it does take a little bit to get used to the cadence of the novel - and the rampant sexism may startle some readers, but even that loses its power to shock and becomes almost comical. Like other books originally published in a weekly serial, there is a good bit of narrative overlap (compounded with Collins' verbosity) - which will be repetitive to fast readers, but those taking their time with it, may be thankful for this.<br /><br />Collins' love for words is evident, but he puts them to good use - particularly in his mastery of the various points-of-views he employed. Collins handles each character well, giving them their own unique voice (even the female characters - which is rather at odds with the frequently sexist comments). The basic structure of the novel itself is also quite remarkable. Collins sets each scene with an obvious eye towards basic logic, and with each section and character, it is obvious that everything was meticulously outlined before its addition into the book as a whole. It was an enjoyable read - it made me laugh a bit, and though the plot has since been \\"borrowed,\\" the mystery felt familiar, but the strength of the characters prevented the book from being remotely boring. It truly is a masterpiece!ds basic logic, and with each section and character, it is obvious that everything was meticulously outlined before its addition into the book as a whole.

0316069884|4.0|For the last two weeks I have been enjoying life meat free.  I never thought that was possible.  Here's why I no longer eat animals from America's factory farms.<br /><br />This review originally appeared on The Englewood Review of Books website.<br /><br />\\"99% of the meat sold in the United States today comes from a factory farm.\\"<br /><br />In the 1970s, my missionary parents uprooted us from the barefoot paradise of Papua New Guinea and planted us in Southern California.  My mother, suffering a bizarre set of health issues, began looking for answers in healthy eating practices.  While other kids ate Twinkies and Ding Dongs, Mother read Adelle Davis books on nutrition and force-fed us cod liver oil.<br /><br />Perhaps because of this, my need to fit in urged me to become a steak-loving \\"normal\\" person. Food, for me, was always more than mere sustenance; it was a visceral, beautiful, even creative thing. But as far being a political statement or a critical health issue, well that was strictly for the weirdoes.<br /><br />Reading Jonathan Safran Foer's Eating Animals was the first time that I seriously considered that the Chicken Parmesan in front of me or the meat neatly stacked in my refrigerator was once a living thing.  And confronted by the horrors of modern animal farming, as recounted in shocking detail by Foer, I had to face certain facts: factory farms are disgusting and dangerous for our health.<br /><br />Foer made a three-year investigation into the sickening story that is American meat, describing with ghastly precision the disease, deformity and eventual mutilation of animals that defines factory farming today. I was filled with revulsion as Foer chronicled his grisly experience and quickly came to understand why Ellen DeGeneres has called Eating Animals \\"one of the most important books [she's] ever read.\\"<br /><br />The story is heart-wrenching, repulsive and barbaric.  One learns that the idyllic family farms we picture in our minds (think Charlotte`s Web) have been transformed into secretive, highly secured factories lined with rows of \\"confinement pens\\" where animals languish, never seeing real daylight.  Foer admits to clandestinely breaking into a turkey farm to discover locked pen doors, gas masks on the walls, chicks with blackened beaks, and both dead and living birds matted with blood and covered in sores.  He details dozens of eerily similar stories indicting the farming of pigs, chickens, cows and even fish:<br /><br />\\"The power brokers of factory farming know that their business model depends on consumers not being able to see (or hear about) what they do.\\"<br /><br />In a riveting (if also occasionally, rambling) narrative, Foer contends the meat industry is corrupt, with structures supporting the consumer-driven \\"need\\" for cheap meat.  Foer notes that prices haven't substantially increased since the mid-fifties, and that the \\"efficiencies\\" of the factory system are the source of this \\"benefit.\\"  I was stunned to learn that only 1% of the meat we consume comes from family-run old-fashioned farms.  The rest is from factories where biodiversity is replaced by genetic uniformity, and the antibiotic-laced animals may be contributing to strange flu like symptoms ravaging millions of Americans.<br /><br />With gritty specifics, allowing for many perspectives, Foer draws personal conclusions, while making it clear that our collective actions can change these practices.  But only by agreeing individually to stop purchasing factory farmed meat.<br /><br />In this philosophical horror story, I was confronted with my \\"need\\" and realized I can no longer be a part of supporting this corrupt system.  A \\"normal\\" evangelical Mom, I am choosing to no longer eat animals unless they come locally and humanely from a farm.<br /><br />We the collective consumer must make conscious choices, even sacrifices.  Foer says it well, \\"We are defined not just by what we do. We are defined by what we are willing to do without.\\"We need to put meat in the middle of the plate of our public discourse.<br /><br />Melody<br />[...]

B007K87C4M|5.0|Well, if you know nothing of the meeting of the minds that has come together on this project, I suggest you listen to some samples or watch the Drag Ropes vid on youtube. If you like what you hear there, or know exactly whom I am referring to as the musical geniuses behind this outing, then you are in for a treat.<br /><br />First of all, this is not a metal or rock record. It is....something special. It is cinematic in scope, brave in execution, bizzare at times, and beautiful always. Never does it lull, but never does it climb either. It is a gray day, a mist on the moor, a surreal clown lurking on the street corner in the dark. It swells with weight, but never collapses. It is everything that is right with this world, gone horribly wrong. If you are like me and seek something completely different, you should be hitting the buy it now button. But if you prefer your world to be the light and dark, this sliver of twilight may not be for you....

B005L38QK2|5.0|I've used Razer products for almost a decade but always heard great things about Steelseries and wanted to try them out. I ordered this mouse after my ancient Razer Copperhead died. Got here a day earlier than the estimated window so I was ecstatic! I opened up, installed the mouse and used it for a bit, everything was a breeze. Until I took an extended leave from my computer, then as I returned I zapped my mouse with a static shock. I did all the standard troubleshooting things to fix it with no joy. It was dead. In fact, as I left it plugged in, the short in the mouse heated up and put a bubble in my mousepad (it's a hard plastic one). When it cooled it was fine but I quickly contacted Steelseries support and they took care of everything and got me a new mouse back to me within less than a week. I did pay shipping to them but with flat rate boxes was not that much. My new mouse has withstood a big static shock without a hiccup. That fault is not a normal occurrence. If you are looking at this mouse, don't let that story scare you away.<br /><br />Overall, their customer service was great, I'm a huge fan of the product as well. Fits multiple grip styles, I feel it's the perfect size, comes with loads of nice but simple (often overlooked) features. Definitely 5 stars from me to the whole Steelseries company.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|disgusting. all three books. a huge waste of my time and money!!!!!!<br />vulgar, sick, not enough info given before downloading book.
0345803485|1.0|Where to begin... This book is so horrendous I cannot believe that it has any hype at all. The author has NO skill whatsoever. The writing is so repetitive. I read three chapters before I could no longer stomach the idiocy. Apparently this writer thinks \\"ghost of a smile\\" is a stroke of genius. It is used often. Double Crap???? Who says that? \\"Jeez, crap, & oh my\\"  make up a large portion of this drivel. \\"Long index finger\\" was used three times in the same chapter. The characters' names are Grey and Steele? Seriously? I am absolutely certain that there are far better books written in spiral bound notebooks under the mattresses of teenage girls all over the country. The popularity of this book both baffles and saddens me. It glamorizes abusive relationships. It is contrite and preposterous. It is an insult to my intelligence. PLEASE... Save your money.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Some of the 1-star reviews of this book complain that the book is too dark, too twisted, completely implausible. They also complain that the characters are all unlikeable and there is no one in this book to relate to. I wholeheartedly agree with these complaints, but, for me, they came together as a truly fantastic read. I can't say I \\"enjoyed\\" reading this book, as the subject matter is devastating and painful...but I was completely invested and engaged from the first page.<br /><br />The narrator, Eva, is the mother of this boy who went completely off the rails and massacred several students at his high school. There's no sympathy for Eva here, as she comes off as incredibly full of herself throughout the book. She feels very self-righteous about all of her choices and looks down her nose at everyone else's choices. She herself has travelled the world, and is educated and sophisticated, and uses words a normal person has to look up in the dictionary. Everyone else's interests are trite, pedestrian, not good enough or interesting enough for someone so unique. Seriously, she comes off like a horribly shallow and self-satisfied individual. Her husband sounds like a complete dolt throughout the book, the daughter is gentle and simple to the point of stupidity. And Kevin. Well, Kevin is horrible from birth. It sounds from the book as though he was born wanting to cause terror to all around him.<br /><br />This is probably the only book I've ever read where all of the characters are so unlikeable, and yet I thought the book was excellent. Eva's prose is beautiful, and her stories heartbreaking. Her yearning for her former life is tangible and heartfelt, even though she's an ungrateful wretch and has no love for her child.<br /><br />The ending was completely unexpected for me, and when I reached the end it felt...horrible and raw. The book is like a wound. The whole thing, but especially the end. I highly recommend it.
0345803485|4.0|If your looking for the best book ever written your not going to get it here. However I love series books, and while this is my first erotica novel there wasn't really a story until the second book. By the end of the second book I like the characters.<br />Where to start with the writing....um the sex scenes were good all though the \\"down there\\" references were repetitive and not erotic<br />If I hear her refer to her \\"inner goddess\\" one more time I might puke. Her subconscious throughout the entire novel was irritating, and it made her seem like a mental case.<br />Once you get past all that you might like it but I doubt the book is for everyone<br /><br />I liked it, but I also liked Twilight...Just saying
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I wasn't really looking for any book to read. I was just following S on her RobStenation blog. And suddenly I came across this post<br /><br />Kristen talks 'Fifty Shades of Grey' - From Entertainment Weekly<br />I had to know what it was all about.<br /><br />O M G.<br /><br />I ended up Google it. And started reading. Once started, I couldn't stop. I started reading it right in the evening right after work. I ended up reading it through the night. Given the clue it was \\"'Edward and Bella' are now Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele.\\" I thought it had something to do with vampires. But I was dead wrong. It wasn't. And the surprise kept me reading.<br /><br />I finished the book the following afternoon, all sleep deprived. I haven't had this feeling to stay up all night and read since Twilight series.<br /><br />And, oh no, the surprise didn't end. I thought if I would just give it time and finish and be done, and I would gain my life back. But no,.... I read through those 528 pages to come to \\"End of Part 1\\".<br />*****serious jaw dropped right there*****<br /><br />I had no idea I just got myself into another trilogy. Ah, man, I bought Fifty Shades Darker without thinking. I just needed to know what would happen to Christian and Ana. And it didn't disappoint. This book is definitely the book that makes people fall head over heels for Christian. E.L. James makes Christian so vulnerable and lovable. Oh... I wasn't so jealous at the beginning, but now, with Fifty Shades Darker, I wish I was Ana!! >.&lt;

B004J4WKUQ|3.0|D&D! Rush! Joust! Max Headroom! All these eighties references and hundreds more are waiting for you, intertwined in every plot arc of the story.<br /><br />This was a perfectly entertaining read. You likely won't enjoy it much if you're under 30 or over 50. But if you did any growing up during the early eighties, this book might be for you!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I chose to read this book because it was on the New York Best Sellers list.  I did read some reviews and I have to admit I was a little apprehensive at first.  Needless to say I have finished the trilogy and I don't want it to be over.  This book is very well written. The use of imagery, and the development of all the characters allows the reader to associate with atleast someone in the story line.  I recommend the trilogy to everyone I know that reads.  I have been presented with questions related to the book being a porno on paper.  My response to that is, it is not a porno.  A porno doesn't have a plot and this book surely does.  If the casual reader can get passed the \\"taboo\\" that is associated with the storyline, they will LOVE the book.<br /><br />I get tickled everytime I see a review on the T.V. and the women discussing the book get embarrassed and talk about how it was a little to much for them too much.  They know that they read it, and they ENJOYED it.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|...thus making it annoyingly combursome to play.  until this issue is fixed, i am deleting it from my Kindle Fire.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The third book of the series is FANTASTIC.  I just can't put into words what I think about the last book in the series.  I love Ana and Christian, and how throughout the story line they grow individually and as a couple.  It makes me love them even more.  Although the end of the book was a fairy tale ending I can't help but wanting to know more.<br /><br />I agree with several other reviews that I have read.  If only there were more stars!!!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|My four year old played it and racked up $15 in coins. I saw all these charges on my credit card a month latter. Shame on the people who credited this app. Do not let your kids play this app.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|i WASNT SURE I WAS GOING TO LIKE THIS SERIES WHEN I READ BOOK 1.  BOOK 2 WAS GREAT AND REALLY GOT YOU EMPATHIZING WITH THE CHARACTERS.. bOOK 3 WAS TOTALLY AWESOME  CANT WAIT FOR MORE
032147404X|2.0|you'd think the #1 selling photography book would be a good buy but i was highly disappointed.  the first page of every chapter was the author blabbing about some story that seems relevant but later tells you he made it all up to supposedly make a point.  what a waste of time and paper especially since each chapter is only 3-5 pages long and the first page is worthless.<br /><br />its only seems logical that the author explains that if you ask him how to take a certain shot he would just say set your aperture/shutter speed/ISO to a certain setting without giving you the technical detail behind it but . . . . you'd never remember those settings and when to use them without a little knowledge of why you would choose a certain setting.  the pictures weren't all that impressive either.  how can i learn from a photographer that uses stock photos in his book.<br /><br />seems like you'd have to buy the 3 part set to get the full picture but thats $40-50 when you can purchase another photography book such as understanding exposure ~$16 that would give you a more well rounded understanding of photography.<br /><br />the most irritating thing about the book was the extremely lame humor.  it takes up 1/5th of the book without offering any relevant benefit to the reader.  you could probably condense all 3 books into one if you eliminated the terrible jokes and irrelevant story telling.
B007DIQB50|1.0|I was very excited about this album because I LOVED Pink Friday. However, I don't like the music style and variation from track to track. A few songs are hard core and I would not be comfortable with anyone around me hearing the constant vulgar language. Only 3 of the songs on the whole CD are worth listening to and 2 of those are played on the radio. Save your money and download the MP3's individually. Boooooo!
0817439390|5.0|i first got the \\"#1 selling\\" Digital Photography Book and was highly disappointed.  the first page of every chapter was the author blabbing about some story that seems relevant but later tells you he made it all up to supposedly make a point while wasting your time.<br /><br />understanding exposure is such an easy read with just the right amount of information for you to understand why and what you're doing.  it reiterates importance points so you don't forget the overall reasons for making certain setting changes.  you get the overall picture/understanding without too much technical stuff. works for me since thats how i learn.  great pictures with captions that tell you the settings the picture was taken at.<br /><br />great for beginners
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very Mario Brothers-esque. Easy and a no brainer. I enjoyed playing it. Great for a free app! Would reccommend it to others.
B006DQ1J0K|5.0|Price, Bergonzi, and Schippers made an excellent recording (now out of print) of \\"Ernani\\" in a Rome studio in 1967; it is textually complete.  The 1962 Met broadcast performance reviewed here takes the traditional cuts (about 25 minutes of music), but I think it is better than the studio recording because it is an actual performance, with the tension and electricity naturally generated in a theater with an audience present. Price and Bergonzi are superb in all respects, and one could not ask for a more unrelenting Silva than Giorgio Tozzi. The unexpected reward of the performance is the splendid Don Carlo of Cornell MacNeil. His later work could be erratic, but here his voice is smooth, warm, and commanding when needed.<br /><br />When \\"Ernani\\" was premiered, Verdi was only 30.  At the time of this Met production, Thomas Schippers was only 32, and he conducted this performance with appropriately youthful vigor, as well as complete authority.  He also showed that the 1962 Met Orchestra was not a rag-tag ensemble when it had the kind of strong and decisive leadership he provided.<br /><br />I recommend that you load this recording into your player, turn up the volume, and settle back for nearly two hours of operatic excitement from this Met production, about which critic Irving Kolodin wrote, \\"Early Verdi has rarely sounded more verdant.\\"
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Holy guacamole, that was one emotional roller coaster of a book. I haven't read a book that tugged at my heartstrings as much as this book did in a very long time. For as much as this book elicited feelings of joy, it also brought me to tears, and not the classy single tear rolling down the cheek cry, but a full blown embarrassingly messy cry.<br /><br />I went into this book with not-so-high hopes since I wasn't crazy about Looking For Alaska, but I have to say that all my expectations were beyond exceeded. Green's writing was consistent. The plot was perfect. The characters were real. If you know anything about my style in books, it's that these three things really make me tick. Green absolutely nailed it and I can't express how glad I am that I gave his writing a second chance.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so awesome best game ever get it at all costs 5 stars don't just stand there get it is awesome
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I watched Captain America, expecting good action and a decent story. I left this movie feeling mostly satisfied with the action, character development, and love story (though not a main theme).<br /><br />The Hype: Many were wondering whether Chris Evans could pull of being Captain America. I would say he did an honorable job. His acting was timely, felt natural, and had some humor in the mix. He is also perfect in terms of his body (very ripped I may add). His body and delivery certainly fit the bill as Captain America. It doesn't hurt that he is handsome as well. He commands stage presence and has a solid performance. He has a few superb acting moments.<br /><br />The cast: A well rounded cast with some new actors/actresses in the mix. I enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones as the Colonel, Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, and Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter. Generally, most of the cast and supporting actors were solid. Soldiers casted all did a wonderful job in creating a believable atmosphere, while also blending some humor. Humor is always welcomed in action movies.<br /><br />My experience: The backdrop and character development of Steve Rogers (Captain America) was entertaining and timed just right. It did not feel dragged nor too short. The movie explores Steve as a puny, short, weak individual whom gets chosen to become an chemically enhanced soldier, because of his intelligence, courage, and humility. As he progressed, we are treated with a musical segment, highlighting Rogers' career as Captain America, as a performer. Moving forward, Rogers had enough of the performing career and wanted to help win the war and against Red Skull. The action was solid. Love starts to build between Captain and Peggy Carter. Though it's just a side story, it's still refreshing to see their chemistry on screen. It will be interesting to see if Captain has any internal conflicts (not being able to see Peggy again) in future Captain America installments.<br /><br />Overall, a well made movie with a solid cast. Definitely worth the time to enjoy some action and the story of Captain America.solid cast. Definitely worth the time to enjoy some action and the story of Captain America.

B001DHIYBQ|3.0|...Because I just bought this version (2008 Century Media reissue), expecting to hear the remastering job that was done by Century Media/Lonely Planet Records when they reissued the album back in 1999. I figured, 'why would they need to remaster it yet again, on the same Label'? Boy, was I in for a surprise! I used to own the original release on cassette, so When it was reissued on CD in 1999, I had heard that version as well. Both sounded great, with the '99 reissue being just slightly better sounding than the original.<br /><br />  Fast forward to 2008. For some reason, Century Media had decided to 'remaster' the album yet again, instead of just reissuing the older version, which is pretty hard to find at this point. The individual who did the 'remastering' for the album, has done a less than satisfactory job, to say the least. This person has simply cranked the high/low end, compressed the signal so bad that a lot of the tracks are actually bordering on 'white noise', jacked up the volume, then ran it through a 'batch mastering' processor! In case some of you don't know, 'batch' mastering simply takes all of the levels of a group of tracks, finds the 'peak', or highest level of volume within the group, and compresses the entire set of tracks so that the volume on each is exactly the same throughout. Doesn't leave much room for dynamics, does it? If anyone here has heard the horrendous 'remastering' that was done to the Nuclear Assault catalogue that Century Media also reissued, you will have an idea of what this album sounds like. I wouldn't doubt it may even be the same person!<br /><br />  Given that there have been more than a few reissues from various record labels of this album since the 1999 Century Media/Lonely Planet Records reissue, I would try to find that version, or the original Combat Records release. I haven't heard the 2004, or 2011 versions, but I'm willing to bet there's a good one out there, somewhere!  I, myself, will more than likely not stopuntil I have obtained the best sounding version of this album that my hard earned money can buy! The music is that good!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have enjoyed both the Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  I think they were written well, kept the reader guessing and created the desire to read more.
B000IMKDPC|3.0|meh. Don't know much about X-men, and this didn't really enlighten or addict me. Decent action movie I guess. Good acting.
B001I8A76A|5.0|I love Pink!!! This album is packed full of great music. She has a wonderful voice and infuses her music with great rhythm and vocals. Each song makes you want to sing along and dance to the beat. I highly recommend this album to people who have never heard Pink or to those like me who love her!!!
0439023491|4.0|I went through this one really fast. Couldn't put it down. Unlike the first book, I was unable to predict a good number of the plot twists. There were some I guessed at a little bit, but not the extent and details.<br /><br />I'm not sure how to feel about her confusion between Peeta and Gale. I think it's because Gale just doesn't have as much \\"screen time\\" as Peeta. But I just don't feel anything about Gale. I know she cares about him desperately, but honestly, I don't. I couldn't care less whether he lives or dies. I do care about Peeta, though.<br /><br />I've begun finding Katniss a bit frustrating. The behavior which I easily excused as entirely plausible in the first book has begun to really grate on me. Her inability to trust people who I see as obviously on her side really started to bother me. Of course, I'm sure anyone would say that in her situation it's entirely understandable. But I can't get past it, anyway. It really bothered me reading about her contemplating murdering people who were helping her. It wasn't just the more understandable mistrust toward the other tributes, but the head game master, whose name I've already forgotten despite having just finished reading the book literally 10 minutes ago. He SHOWED her that he was on her side early on in the book, yet she kept thinking of him as an enemy throughout the entire book, ignoring what she was shown.<br /><br />It bothered me that she never thought to try to defy the capitol. In the first book, it made sense not to. In this book, there were already uprisings going on, and she knows the capitol wants them dead, and they're doing everything they can to hurt her. I really wanted her to try earlier on to defy them, to simply refuse to kill the other tributes. I'm sure someone will point out the problem with that is that it's hard to ensure that they would agree to the same. Sure. But nonetheless, I wanted that, because I really felt it was time for her to take a stand against the abuse they were being put through.<br /><br />I was very satisfied with the ending, I have to say. Very eager to see what's going to happen next. Also, I freaking love Haymitch.ing put through.<br /><br />I was very satisfied with the ending, I have to say.

B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This quiet, low-key documentary describes a most amazing man, Jiro. For more than half-a-hundred years, this octagenarian has devoted himself to one thing: perfecting the art of making sushi. His restaurant might not look like much. You pass through a subway turnstile on the way there, then find just ten seats in the cramped space inside. A lot of the time, staff outnumber customers. You need a reservation a month in advance and expect to pay US$375 minimum, but I assume it goes up from there. In return, you get a Michelin three-star experience - according to Michelin, the third star means it's worth visiting the country just to experience that one restaurant.<br /><br />In some ways, Jiro-san seems a throwback. He expects a ten-year apprenticeship from his students (some of whom last only one day). His ethic resembles a samurai's, in its single-minded, lifelong devotion to perfecting his craft. When he passes the baton, it will be by primogeniture. The younger son will need to make his own way in the world. And, surprisingly, his perfectionism radiates outward through into his suppliers. His rice dealer sells him only the finest, a grade of rice that he won't even sell to others since they won't know how to prepare it correctly. His fish dealers, each masters in their own right, ask themselves whether their catch is worthy of him.<br /><br />It's inspiring to see such mastery, but intimidating too. He admits, \\"I wasn't much of a father,\\" since family came second to his craft. That degree of dedication seems beyond imagining, when I try to fit myself into it. (The 'now' generation won't have a clue.) Still, I value the knowledge that the world still rewards artisans at his level of mastery. Jiro is a treasure, and his heritage will enrich the world.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty neat. a few of them are challenging and its a little hard to earn the points but overall I'm having fun so its worth the playtime
B004FOA84A|4.0|The puzzles were challenging but after some thought were solvable.  I was surprised when I got to the end so quickly.  Overall fun game.  A few more puzzles could be added to lengthen the game.

B000FVRACK|5.0|First of all....at his age if we can even get out of bed it will be a miracle. His playing of these three concertos was effortless almost transcendental. I was concerned getting this DVD since so many of the DVDs from the 1980s and 1990s are disappointments. Most of the DVDs with Karajan and Bernstein are botched...the video is simply mediocre. Now on this 1975 film we see crisp detail, great camera angles, no video noise, no bluriness, brilliant colors and natural flesh. This recording is better than the recently restored Godfather Trilogy on Blu-ray and way better than the precious recordings of Bernstein and Karajan. How can this possibly be? Some of these recordings are 15 years later....so obviously a special technique was used to film Rubenstein for eternity. It is a shame this was not done with the other greats.....compared to this practically all of them disappoint.

B000002JOH|5.0|This album can't be praised enough, if we are grading it on a 5 star scale then it should be at least a 7 star rated album. Its just that excellent. There is LITERALLY not one flaw to be found on this album, PERIOD. That alone should get it the 5 star rating, then couple that with the fact that it blows every other Metal album completely out of the water (except Master of Puppets, which is also a 5 star rating annihilator, in other words it also deserves way more stars then are available to give it), in terms of production, originality, you name the category this album exceeds the expectations in that category. Here is the perfect example of just how great this album is, The Late great Dimebag himself, literally cried (look it up if you don't believe me) the first time he sat and listened to this album from start to finish, yeah thats right he cried, its just that good, no as a matter of fact, to call it ''good'' is an insult, it is excellence personified, if every band, metal or not put this much effort into putting out a quality product with no filler such as this, I would starve to death because I would never leave my stereo long enough to eat or work.
0393327345|4.0|The plot is certainly entertaining and fun. However, in typical Palahniuk style, the writing style is confusing. Sometimes it feels like Stream-of-Consciousness and other times it just seems to wander. I went in to the novel already knowing the \\"twist\\" but I was still enthralled with the narrative.
1400079276|5.0|Kafka on the Shore is Murakami's most fully realized fiction, a master class on the glories and pratfalls of being human.<br /><br />The novel is structured as two stories that twine around each other. Fifteen year old Kafka Tamura runs away from his oppressive father in Tokyo to a seaside town in southern Japan. He takes refuge in a small library under the kindly care of a transgendered librarian.  There Kafka lives out a vividly imagined modern version of the classic Greek tragedy: he kills his father, maybe, mates with Ms. Saeki, a librarian he believes might be his mother, and sleeps with Sakura, an older girl who could be his sister. In his search for meaning and connection, Kafka plays out the dilemma of porcupines in the cold: huddling for warmth, then shuffling away in pain.<br /><br />The other story strand follows Nakata, a mildly retarded man who cannot read but is plugged in to other realities: for instance, he can talk to cats and make fish and leeches rain out of the sky.  Aided by his wonderfully rendered sidekick Hoshino, Nakata embarks on a mission to repair a hole in the fabric of time. His task overlaps with Kafka's quest to discover where in this world he truly belongs.<br /><br />Murakami's genius lies in combining straightforward descriptions of everyday existence - eating, sleeping, shopping, screwing - with fantastic elements that are elaborate metaphors for hard to express emotional states.  His characters tend to shuttle between the realities of daily life and fantasy worlds shaped by their emotional traumas.  By trying to avoid the pain that comes from making yourself vulnerable to other people, characters like Kafka and Ms Saeki get thrown into shadow worlds filled with effects but lacking in substance.  Their emotional blocks turn physical reality into a pale approximation of itself.<br /><br />Murakami isn't perfect.  Kafka on the Shore is a little too long, and there's too much pontificating about the nature of reality.  But these are quibbles.  This is a Nobel-level novelist's bold, brilliant, beautifully realized exploration of what you're signing up for when you choose to live in the here and now, tied to others.quibbles.

0345803485|4.0|I have to admit I really enjoyed reading this trilogy!! The storyline and all the characters captured me and took my time away from family for five days....I couldn't lift my head off!!! I thought the author did a wonderful job creating something unrealistic, but yet desired for so many women out there. Attractive, successful, rich businessman, charming and mysterious ...and here is this simple college graduate girl that all of a sudden gets trapped into this relationship. Not by her will, but they are both drawn to each other. It is definitely in the erotica category, and it almost feels like the entire relationship revolves around sex...the first book is all about sex and nothing else.<br /><br />I didn't particularly enjoy the first book much and I had a sigh of relief when i finished. All the S&M sex scenes were getting too much for my taste and almost too painful to read. I have to agree with most readers, the style of writing was terrible. Teenage dirty sex talk, repetitive words on every page, limited vocabulary. And I am claiming this statement and English is not even my first language!! so it must be even worse for the English speaking audiences.<br /><br />The second and third had a much better development of the story. Personalities were more revealed, some unexpected twists to the story. I liked it!!<br /><br />So...if you get passed the first book, definitely purchase second and third!!! Well worth your time...if you have it :)
1937986039|5.0|Having decided to buy a more sophisticated camera I purchased my Fujifilm X10 almost as soon as it came out, and when I opened the box I immediately studied the included owner's manual.  Like most company-written manuals it quickly explained the camera's settings but, like most company manuals, it didn't give any suggestions about which settings were considered \\"standard\\" and which should only be chosen for a particular situation.  It just explained what each function and setting did.  (The manual was actually written better than most, but it tended to overwhelm me with unnecessary details before I understood the camera's basic functions and controls.)  After setting up my camera and taking many, many photos I felt a bit frustrated that I never really achieved the results I felt I should get from such a camera.  There's no doubt that this is an amazing camera, and I felt that the photos I took with it should be consistently outstanding.  But to be honest, my photos seemed to be about the same quality as I had achieved with my cheaper point-and-shoot cameras.<br /><br />Then I purchased this book.  Wow!  After reading the first few pages I realized that I hadn't chosen the correct settings for my needs; hadn't downloaded the newest Firmware update (the author tells you how); and never realized what I could do with this incredible camera.  This book has been a revelation!  Reading it is like having one of the designers from the Fujifilm camera factory sit down with you and slowly but methodically explain the camera's functions one by one.  The author, Alexander White, tells you what settings to use if you just want to snap vacation photos, and what to do if you want to utilize the camera's advanced functions.  The book is clearly thought out, written in a pleasant, conversational style, and well illustrated.  If you have a Fujifilm X10, you will be doing yourself a great disservice if you don't purchase this book.  My only complaint --- I wish the book were spiral-bound so it would lay flat while I am trying to both read and fiddle with my camera at the same time.  I also wish the book had been printed on glossy paper so the color illustrations would  be a little crisper --- but that's a very minor complaint.<br /><br />This is the author's ninth book in his \\"Photographer's Guide\\" series, and I believe all of his books are self-published.
