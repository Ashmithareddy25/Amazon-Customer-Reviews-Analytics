B005LAIHZY|5.0|Bought this for my kids' stocking stuffer during Christmas time, and they just love it.  Great story line, awesome animation, and as most all Disney films, good for the heart.
0451228731|5.0|Gave this book 5 stars because I couldnt put it down.  Was recommended by a friend for the futuristic technology, and I was not disappointed.  Suarez  has nailed this thriller.  Just bought the sequel, cant wait to read it also.
B005LAIHE0|4.0|Good movie. Good cast. Overall enjoyable film and worth watching. Acting is enjoyable and storyline as well. Good chick flick
B00B99KJR0|2.0|Not always working. Once the keyboard just popped up and had to restart the level. And couldn't get to China
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Very hard to say which one is the best album,and remastered even better,sounds really great, top band of the world.
B007UR1OHO|5.0|What a great movie.  Not only is it a romantic film but it makes you laugh a lot too.  These two have a real chemistry on screen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|DO NOT READ THIS WOMEN AND CHILDREN!!!!!!!!  PLEASE!!!!!!!<br /><br />Minecraft is exteremly fun. It has good graphics and is a good game for people who love survival games. I play it all the time and I play the creative and survival mode. I Play the creative mode because I like to create things. I also play the survival mode because... I'm not sure why I like to play the survival mode. Mmmmm. I think I would have sex with somebody here... lets see.... I pick YOU! come to my house honey. I'm a very SEXY 28 year old woman.
B008CRC506|5.0|Loved the music, loved the characters. Will be really sad if they don't pick it up next year as is rumored.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I got this book from Amazon Kindle on a whim thinking it was a Tesla biography.  The book is more about what qualities make for human greatness and Tesla is an illustration of the author's focus and theme.  That being said, I found the book inspiring.  It is short and I assume it is a part of the author's longer book on this subject.  It didn't take long to read and I did learn some basic information about Tesla' s career and life. Buy it if you want to be inspired to pursue greater things. Don't if you are looking for a full detailed biography of Tesla' s life.
B00B5AIB14|5.0|great quality remaster, great live show....but where are the alternate takes that everyone knows exist? fans will continue to wait.
174311740X|5.0|Kate Morton has proven to be a great storyteller, and this book by no means is an exception. The Secret Keeper is a mystery full of intrigue and populated by great characters.  Once you think the author has revealed all secrets, the last secret to be uncovered is unexpected and so perfect that the reader is left with a more wonderful ending than the one they have imagined for the beloved characters themselves.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book kept your interest because it had a lot of different mysteries that you had the opportunity to guess what came next.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I enjoyed this one just like the previous one. It is a true Resident Evil movie. Nice special features on it, too.<br /><br />When I watch the CG ones it just make me wonder more and more why they made the decisions they made about the live action ones in theaters.<br /><br />Would be nice to get a normal digital copy instead of UltraViolet. Like all movies, UltraViolet copies suck and it needs to go away.
B00992CF6W|5.0|got it for the xbox and cant stop playing it!!! just wish they would make a free version so I could see if they changed or modifyed anything
B006PAZMMK|5.0|Glad I bought the entire CD. I listen to it all the time. All the songs are great. Summit, Banarang, and Kyoto are the best of all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been too obsessed with this game I dug a mine around the entire world and I'm running out of mining space. I have found 53 diamond but now I only have 49 because I made boots. 70 gold and over a hundred iron. but I probably would've got more if I hadn't spent all that iron on 3 pairs of armor that my sister lost. when you find gold though never even make armor or weapons out of it the durability is terrible.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fascinating, but I don't really find sequels  something off interest. I would have been content with an an ending. Good read,enough said :))
B009P25TQE|5.0|Can't get enough of this wonderful young artist.  I love all the songs but in particular &#34;En Brazos de Ella&#34;, &#34;Extasis&#34;, &#34;Desidratandome&#34;, &#34;Quien&#34; y &#34;El Beso&#34;.  Listen to this artist, you won't be sorry...
B001FB55H6|5.0|This was the first Blu-Ray I ever purchased - and I don't regret it.  This has become my second- favorite movie of all time after Casablanca, and even my father, who doesn't like super-hero movies, loved this.  The soundtrack couldn't be more perfect.  Watchmen is a tale of choices and consequences, and it deserves a viewing - just look past the fact that the characters are mostly costumed heroes...
B005LAIISA|5.0|This was the last to add to our collection. My daughter loves all of the Ice Age movies.  She loves this one just as much as the others.
B00003CXB4|5.0|You cant go wrong with the lion king. This product was in perfect condition and there is no scratches or skips.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|This was a decent movie, just a little drab. In my opinion, a bit of a &#34;guy movie&#34;.  I did like the twists at the end, but the movie itself just seemed to be rather slow-moving.  Denzel did a great job with the acting, as always, but it is not one of my favorite Denzel movies.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Ron Perlman, Guillermo DelToro, ans Selma Blair - How could you go wrong?  The film is reminiscent of &#34;Blade 2&#34; and &#34;Pan's Laberynth&#34;with its flawless infusion of usually-poor CGI.  You can't really tell what's CGI and what's makeup.  Del Toro has created anothe fun movie that is worth watching several times.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Nothing like a live concert version in music. So much better the studio music. Still hard to believe Ronnie and other members of the band died due to running out of gas in the plane.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|*SPOILERS* I was in love with the Selection...even if it was a little too much like the Hunger Games for my taste. But alas, I just had to know what was going on. It was a four instead of a five simply because I found myself start to get annoyed with America's rashness. Just because Maxon couldn't devote 100% of his time to her, she does major things that mess everything up...and then she cries because she might be sent home. Also, is there still even a question of Aspen vs. Maxon????! Poor Aspen. He needs to just let go. She is obviously still there for a reason.<br /><br />I can't wait until the next book...but I need more to happen. This last book was a little repetitive. How many tests can these girls be put through until he chooses one? Can we get more of a story outside of how much Celeste flirts or how much Kriss has moved up in the competition?? Ugh!!!<br /><br />HOW LONG UNTIL THE NEXT ONE?!?!?
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This movie was not what I expected, but we were pleased.  It is a great family movie - clean, imaginative. My only complaint is the high price. This is only our second rental from Amazon - the first was only $1.99.  This was $4.99!!  I was disappointed with the pricing.
B004L49JYO|4.0|I like this movie had seen it before, just wanted to add it to my bluray collection.<br />Much the same as most in this genre, check it out
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I've been watching the show for some time now and this season was just as great and only keeps getting better.
B007USWCXS|5.0|Upon receiving it, i realized i had ordered a wrong movie but didn't realize it until i had removed the wrapper. So decided to see it. It turned out to be v. good. The quality of the movie & the DVD are both very good. Thnx
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ths is such an awesome game.and is lots of fun to play I hope you have fun playing this wicked game.
B000VYNYN0|4.0|if your looking at this you know this movie.<br />Nice transfer, but &#34;do&#34; watch in full screen mode for best viewing enjoyment.<br />The enhanced widescreen is not as clear and is cropped to make it widescreen.<br />If your a fan like me you have gone through vhs, dvd, well now time to go BR with it.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|I've been trying since I got it (very quick shipping!!) to install it, but having trouble doing that. Company sent an email with vague help that wasn't very helpful. Product looks sturdy, but that's all I can offer.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this show.  Fine acting and writing and acting.  I can't wait for each episode.  I hope the series goes on for years!
1594202842|5.0|This is a great book. It really opens your eyes to how we should focus on education with our children. She is very strict and it is surprising, but also educational.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|This is a great movie. I wanted to get it in the stores, but could not find it in bluray.
1451629184|5.0|This book was intense. I lived in South Lake Tahoe when she went missing. It was in the newspaper daily. That poor step father of hers was the prime suspect I recall. Amazing story.
B0007OY33O|4.0|What do you do when you are a young boy that inherits a fortune from your family and live in a mansion full of beautiful women as your maids? That is what Taro has to face as he tries to hide from the moves by his personal maid service, avoid being a test subject for the science maids and trying to live free from the over protective security maids. All while trying to figure out his feelings from one maid, Mariel.<br /><br />This series starts out with many stories that are on one ep long but hint towards the arc that happens near the end of the series. My favorite two eps are the comic con ep and the baseball ep.

B000085RTZ|5.0|I freakin' love Epica and The Black Halo by Kamelot.  I'm mentioning both because the albums have to be heard together to really get it.<br /><br />Epica and The Black Halo tell the entire story of Faust (Goethe's version).<br /><br />  In Faust The Devil and God make a gamble on one man's soul.  The character of Faust (renamed Ariel for this album) is an alchemist / sorcerer (Faust is loosely based on a real fifteenth century alchemist and self-proclaimed sorcerer) sells his soul to Mephistopheles (sometimes known as Mephisto) for the ultimate life experience, that moment that he would want to never end.<br /><br />  Faust (Ariel) falls in love with a woman named Margaret- Gretchen for short (who is renamed Helena for this album).  Unaware that she is pregnant he leaves her to continue his quest for the greatest experience.<br /><br />  In this album version Helena kills herself and her unborn baby.  In the actual Goethe story she went mad and killed the baby and then was imprisoned, awaiting execution. Faust had tried to rescue her with Mephistopheles but she had felt she deserved her fate for what she did to her baby.  Part 1 of Faust ends with the assurance that Gretchen's soul was saved.  Similarly in Epica Helena's soul is saved.<br /><br />  The Black Halo tells Faust Part 2 as Epica told the story of Faust Part 1.  Faust starts to rebel against Mephistopheles. He briefly gets involved with a woman who distracts him from his lost love but he realizes that it's a lie. And so he lets her go.  Gradually Faust discovers that the ultimate life experience, that moment he wished would never end, is love and compassion.  Love is the only truth.  Because Faust allowed himself to feel compassion and decided to act on it, and found the value of love, despite believing himself to be hopelessly damned, the true selfless compassion and goodness, without the want of the reward of Heaven, he was saved.  Faust ascended to Heaven despite his deal.  Mephisto lost and Faust getsto be with Gretchen in Heaven.<br /><br />These two albums give a gorgeous metal retelling of the Faust story.  Kahn does a fantastic job of singing as both Mephistopheles and Faust.<br /><br /> The only thing about this album I find strange and disorientating is that Heinrich Faust's name is changed to Ariel and Margaret AKA Gretchen is now renamed Helena.  In fact in Goethe's story the woman used to distract Faust from the loss of Gretchen is named Helen in Goethe's Faust story.  I don't understand the purpose of changing Faust's name or Gretchen's. They leave Mephistopheles alone.  I wonder if they realize Faust is public domain.  Anyone can use the name without a problem.  Goethe's version of the story is nearly two hundred years old.  And the historical sorcerer Faust died five centuries ago.  I doubt he cares.<br /><br />Anyway, these albums are a great retelling of the Faust story.  The best songs on Epica, in my opinion, are Descent of the Archangel (where Mephistopheles first appears to Faust / Ariel), Feast for the Vain (Where Faust / Ariel finally agrees to Mephistopheles' offrer) and Lost and damned (Where Faust / Ariel leaves Gretchen / Helena).<br /><br />My favorite songs in The Black Halo are The Black Halo where Faust / Ariel is starting to resist Mephistopheles, Nothing ever dies (Where Faust / Ariel discovers that love is the only truth).  And Momento Mori where Faust AKA Ariel is saved from the defeated Mephistopheles.<br /><br />Goethe's Faust is a gorgeous and under-rated story.  Most versions of the Faust legend leave poor Faust damned bot Goethe had love save him.  And that's the version told in these albums. Sadly both Faust and Goethe are virtually unheard of here in the US.  Most people know, for example, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, but are unfamiliar with the fact that the entire bit with the brooms and buckets was a poem by Goethe called The Sorcerer's apprentice. The famous Mickey Mouse bit is a parody on that.  And if you're familiar with The Dresden Files The Erlking is another folkloric character from a Goethe poem.<br /><br />  If you are reading Goethe's Faust, like stories about damnation and redemption, or the occult than I strongly recommend this album.  It's surprisingly spiritual.  The guitar riffs are powerful.  The vocals are passionate.  And it gives fantastic insight into the characters of Faust (even if they did change the names).<br /><br />I strongly recommend both Epica and The Black Halo but both albums must be bought together to understand the meaning in this rock opera concept album(s) retelling of Goethe's Faust.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|3.75 stars<br />Just a funny note that I listened to The Night Circus on audiobook and it is read by Jim Dale who also narrated all of the Harry Potter books, more than once I forgot which book I was listening too and thought things like I don't remember Dumbledore saying anything like that.<br />I have conflicting feelings about The Night Circus while the premise of the story was intriguing and interesting I spent a good portion of the book confused as to what was going on.  There were so many characters and completing arcs that it was honestly hard to keep track of the story as it jumped around.<br />Celia and Marco are competitors in a game that will last an indeterminate period of time.  The Night Circus is the venue that is created for them to complete in.  Each tries to outdo the other and in the beginning it starts out semi antagonistic.  As time goes on it becomes  more of a collaboration, Marco and Celia sorta bounce off one another to make ever more wonderful and unique tents for the circus.  Neither knows when the challenge will end or what the winner will get.  I found it a little hard to believe that they would be in this completion for so long when it was never stated what they would win at the end of it.  The story progresses for many years with the circus ever growing and becoming even more fantastic.<br />I did enjoy the descriptions of the various areas of the Circus they were descriptive and extremely original the author has a great imagination.  However I enjoyed more when Bailey was going through the tents with Poppet and Widget experiencing the rooms instead of just the description of an area.  The imagery of the circus was wonderful and the characters so intriguing.  I wanted to know so much about all of them.  But the story dragged in places and I still never fully understood why the challenge was ever implemented in the first place other than vanity.<br />This is an intriguing read full of wonderfully unique ideas and imagery I loved the ending as well.  This is a great read if you like the picture painted of the surrounding in the story to be laid out for you otherwise it might get a little slow in a few areas but overall solid story.ing as well.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story is about what it was like English orphanages at the turn of twentieth century.  Two people meet through a newspaper advertisement. The tale takes an<br />n interesting twist.  The story also deals with grief and depression and farming..This is a nice read.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|this book is very helpful in a jam when looking for a foreign phrase or definition .Also its easy to look through
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I really like the book and have read it many times, but not a fan of this 1st of three movies. I got bored watching this and didn't see how it ended. Will have to try again.
B00422LESO|4.0|This is a quick, enjoyable read for any Jane Austen fan. Hale's Austen fantasy land is filled with the wit and romantic blunders one would expect from any Austen novel. Would be a great beach or weekend read.
B00C27LB20|5.0|Not a single, filler track on the self-titled album from this young artist out of the UK with a voice that immediately reminded me of Donovan but in an alternative/folk style with emphasis on vocals and minimalist accompaniment, enough subtle diversity between songs to exclude monotony (haunting ballads to up-tempo bluesy) and yes, it's all been done before but somehow it just \\"feels\\" original, authentic and sincere.  :o)
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Also how do u get zombies and new cars and how to find Bigfoot when are they going to add online multiplayer.
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|This movie turned out better than i was expecting. My kids watch it over and over.  I love the ending!!
1452115567|5.0|Maddie on things is charming and fun-it is a must have if you love dogs and love great photography. Maddie's rescue story makes every image endearing and Theron's eye for capturing her in these places and time are creative and awe inspiring. Congrats to Theron on a job well done and to Maddie for being a patient perfection.
1599290634|5.0|i am an artist and i saw this book while browsing in Barnes and Noble, however i found it cheaper here on amazon so i bought it. over all the book is filled with full page high quality images of different artists and medias. i use this for refference very often and it comes in handy.<br />Pros: good book lots of pictures of vary talented artists<br />Cons: makes you want to buy the other spectrum books
B0084HJE0S|3.0|Informative on the topics but not a user's guide so if you wanted a how-to look elsewhere. It is more geared toward educating on the topic but not on its use.<br /><br />Could have benefited from some spaces between paragraphs so the wall-o-text doesn't detract from what is being said.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|I had to read the Hobbit in school. If they had not made me I probably would not have read it. As it turns out I really like the story. I seen the cartoon hobbit but like the book better. Then I saw this movie and really fell in love with the story. i hope they are making more movies!!
B007ME5BUG|4.0|Well worth the time, if only to convince yourself that &#34;evil&#34; is complicated and no one has completely clean hands.
1452115567|5.0|Theron has created a magical world with a coonhound.  That's right, a COONHOUND.  A sensitive, intense, intelligent and loving coonhound.  When one bonds with a coonhound, there's nothing else that will compare.  Thank you Theron and Maddie for showing America that this breed isn't all about hunting and work.  This breed is about love and life.<br />Bravo on the photographic journey.  And thanks to MADDIE for her patience and care as she's 'on things' all over the country.  Maddie - you are always 'on' my mind.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|By far the best app for bingo.  I am completely addicted.  I play everyday.  I would definitely recommend this game to even the most discerning bingo players.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is a very special movie.  It tells of a little boys search to find his parents while exploring his love for music.  This is one of my favorites.  It is a movie you can share with the family.
B001AW156U|4.0|well I can definitely say that these things are an improvement over it the current PlayStation 3's controller triggers but the problem with these is that they curve out too far. the problem that causes, is that by the way I hold the controller for certain games even the slightest input on the trigger will cause an action I didn't want to happen.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Lots of fun. A good time waster. And the tiny dinosaurs look pretty good. My 5 year old loves playing it with me.
B004U7MQXS|5.0|It's a bit kitchy and cheesy but it's a fun movie, especially if you are a fan of the Beatles.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good easy read with lots of twist. Had a hard time &#34;liking&#34; any of the characters. Had a very surprising ending.
1452115567|5.0|I absolutely love this book!  I keep it on the coffee table in my living room and when friends and family come over to visit I share it with them.  The reaction is the same every time.  We get a laugh and then wonder aloud, &#34;how does Maddie do that?  Moreover , &#34;how does Theron get Maddie to do that? &#34; My colleagues and students have enjoyed looking at this book too.  If you want to get a gift that will boost the spirits of someone needing something to cheer them up, look no further than this book.  I know it's a little early to say this, but I'm planning on buying about a dozen copies of this wonderful book to give as Christmas presents this year!
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|i didnt like it because it was just a trial and the game is kinda stupid. i would not recommend this to anyone i know.

B00A81NFAS|4.0|I really wanted to like SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK and, for the most part, I did...primarily because of the performances of the actors...rather than the screenplay, which I felt was overlong, often convoluted and forced.<br /><br />(I realize that I hold a minority opinion here.  Even my wife disagrees with me, but I have to call `em as I see `em.)<br /><br />From a positive standpoint, this film probably has the finest ensemble cast of 2012.  Jennifer Lawrence certainly deserved her \\"Best Actress\\" Oscar, and it's a shame that Bradley Cooper had to be up the same year as Daniel Day-Lewis' \\"Abraham Lincoln\\".  His performance grabbed me from the opening scene and held me throughout.  Jackie Weaver is quietly marvelous as Cooper's mother, and as his book-making father, Robert DeNiro delivers his finest performance in years.<br /><br />The film opens with Cooper being released into the custody of his parents, after spending eight months in a state mental institution, the result of a plea bargain.  He had come home from work one day to find his wife in the shower with another man, so like any other red-blooded husband, he beat the crap out of the guy.<br /><br />Cooper is determined to put his life back together and win back his wife, even though she has a restraining order against him.  Then, he meets Jennifer Lawrence, a young widow with her own set of problems, and they develop an initially disquieting relationship.<br /><br />For the first half hour or so, director-screenwriter David O. Russell creates an entertaining dramedy with SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, as we meet Cooper and his dysfunctional family, then awhile later, Lawrence.  The dynamics between all of these characters remains engrossing for most of the picture, but after the introductions and initial encounters, Russell, who adapted the novel by Matthew Quick, does not seem to know how to develop the action in a believable manner.  Part of the problem is that there are too many secondary, albeit well-played, characters in this film resulting in the screenplay occasionally losing its focus.<br /><br />The final twenty minutes of the movie, involving a large bet on a football game and a dance contest, does not ring true, nor does the scene leading up to it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a movie worth seeing, if for no other reason than the actors, all of who are extremely likable.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains many extras, including several deleted scenes, \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes, one of which involves a close look at the dance rehearsals between Cooper and Lawrence.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Just downloaded this game and my 5yr old loves it. It is very entertaining and fun. Even I enjoy playing it :)
B002BIULQ2|5.0|My 10-year-old daughters love the movie.  We watch it all the time.  I think it has a pretty good story behind it.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|I'm a big fan of the giant label boxes the record companies are putting out these days.  I paid about $106 for this box a month ago.  As I'm writing this, it's since been reduced in price to $89.  Any price under $100 for this set if a fantastic deal.  The booklet isn't particularly informative, and I would have appreciated text and libretti for the vocal and opera works, but the value for the package is otherwise tremendous.  Like the artists on its roster, Philips wasn't a particularly adventurous label, but the quality of its talent was outstanding.  Now I just need to find an extra 60 hours to listen to the whole thing.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|What's not to love about a Bon Jovi CD? They just get better with age!!!! This may just be their best release ever!  Packaged very well.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I honestly have to say, this is BY FAR the funniest sitcom I have EVER seen, in my lifetime!! The characters are so extremely rich, never ceasing to amaze me!  If you don't find yourself falling over from the laughter, then you are PROBABLY dead.... LOL!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The kindle version is of good quality, no typos or formatting issues. I did notice that the page designs at the head of each chapter don't format as nicely to the kindle as they do an iPhone, but it is decorative and forgivable. No complaints, it's a compelling book and made me want to buy #2!
B002NT3B52|5.0|Fascinating! I read this book to learn more about dog senses and I learned about the &#34; why's &#34; in dog behavior. I love my dog even more after reading this book.

B004YM6JP0|5.0|I ordered this for my friend three days before christmas and got it on the 23rd. My order information said I wouldn't get it until January 1st. I was extremely pleased with that. The product came in perfect condition as described and made my friend extremely happy.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Another great CD from the Beatles.  Absolutely love this and would recommend it.  A nostalgic trip down memory lane. Beatles forever!

B0015FHDRW|5.0|If punk rock existed in the 50's it would sound like this. I love it and if you like Green Day spin off records go listen to Money Money 2020 as well.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Yes, I bought 1962-1966 (Red) and 1967-1970 (Blue) and the tracks are great.  Absolutely love both these albums, I would recommend them..
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|A funny and witty movie; that will leave you laughing and asking yourself (if you're at least 40) &#34;Am I like that?&#34;  Well worth the rental price.  Great date night movie.  The one negative comment would be that the movie runs a bit long; could have been great 15 minutes shorter.
B000B589JI|4.0|The loop that connects the canister to the key ring is a bit flimsy and I've had to clamp it back onto the thing on more than one occasion when it slips off, but the canister, itself, is perfection.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I've owned my pair for about a month now.  I only use this for PC, so I can't comment on the console functionality.  While I haven't had any problems yet, I can see where people are coming from with the swiveling earcups breaking off.  It is a rather weak plastic joint, and probably isn't necessary.  However, I consider this a good deal for a powered headset.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Works out of the box in Windows 7 and Arch Linux.<br />-Good quality sound.<br />-Fits well (I have a large head).<br />-Separate speaker cable lets me listen to applications that can't route sound to a second audio device.<br />-LONG cord.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Definite hiss noticeable.  It's not a problem for games, but I could see it being annoying for music or making calls.<br />-Could stand to be louder.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|It's very interesting this season.<br />It has lot of drama and we need to continue with the next season immediately!!!
B001F0TM5I|2.0|There are only two things good about this film, Kurt Russell and the last 30 minutes of the film.  This film could have easily been cut down from 2 hours to 40 minutes. I don't understand the long drawn out dialogue scenes with the characters, these scenes are 10-15 minute segments of the characters just talking about nothing.  It doesn't make you emphasize with the characters or grow attached to them.  Quentin Tarantino is a great writer and the way he writes dialogue is like eavesdropping on a real conversation but none of these conversations are interesting. The movie was a real drag until Kurt Russell starts speaking. After 40 minutes into the film, my interest was high but it goes into another lull period until the last 30 minutes.  Also, I didn't understand some of the film techniques the opening credits match a film from the 1970s, however as the film progresses it looks like a modern day film. Even though the film is rough to watch all the way through, the last thirty minutes are well worth watching, it is a wonderful chase scene and one of the best I have ever seen.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|With the great names of the cast I could have done with out the supporting cast.  The two main charactors were great!!
B007PP2J9I|4.0|After reading Zero Day by the same author, I was hooked! Good read and more interesting tidbits about what is possible if you are an expert computer hacker. Another good effort from an author with great expertise in this area.
B00AIBZJS4|4.0|i really enjoyed this film, it was a beautiful experience, watching it in the theatre. I don't really like leaving feedback, sorry
B0076DELIG|4.0|Very enjoyable. Michael Connelly at just best. I just love his Bosch stories. This was an excellent addition to the series.
B003L77GH4|5.0|LOVE VAMPIRE DIARIES. IM ADDICTED! WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE ALL SEASON DVDS.  NO SCRATCHED, NO SMUDGES. GREAT QUALITY. LOVE THIS!!
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Well written story based on current (or almost current) events - a great background on what is actually possible and probable by hackers in this computer age. Fascinating to read and the author's expertise is shown throughout. Heartily recommend this and his other book, Trojan Horse.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Most of movie is finding individuals to vote for amendment 13 .Slow.  Rented the movie from Amazon.  Glad I did not spend $20.00 plus going to the theater.
B008CLI4N4|3.0|Get rid of the scenes that should be rated X and the rest is fantastic!  Great, complicated story line with the character development that I love.
B006MGDVIY|5.0|This is every bit a documentary piece but it's setup in a 3-stage movie progression that it appears like an actual movie.  Basically you have the beginning in which Senna's early life is introduced and it sets up how there was reluctance from his family to have him continue racing into Formula One so already there is drama there that would build and continue onto his racing career.  Then there is the actual hardship he faced in Formula One in which there is a &#34;Bad Guy,&#34; if you will and Senna's character is tested.  Then there  are the scenes that build onto the end of piece and everything is done very nicely, from the never before seen footage's to the commentary by the selected people who knew him and were/are very knowledgeable with the sport of Formula One.  Senna was not just a race car driver.  He was a man, a God-fearing man, who lived his life through racing.  This is no different from a painter living and learning through his/her paintings or a musician playing in front of a crowd in a small bar just because of the desire for artistic expression.  This is why Senna is still remembered, and why everyone should at least watch this film once.
1592537251|5.0|Who this book is for.<br />This book is for legit artists and this book is for hobbyists and enthusiasts. The book is just so well done...let's begin.<br /><br />Book Quality -&#62; Paperback with a nice slipcover and wide pages. Binding was very good. All images of the artwork spanning from watercolors, pen, pencil, ink, etc etc are very vivid and beautiful. No washed out or bland printing here folks!<br /><br />Content -&#62; It takes you on a tour around the WORLD exhibiting impromptu and deliberate sketches, en plein air watercolor pieces, miniature ink master pieces, of amatuers, novices the list goes on. Most pieces are done in Moleskine journals and other journal brands that are easily accessible to anyone. It outlines specifically the medium used by the artist on each piece. Just nice...<br /><br />Written content is concise and NON Verbose. Gives you just enough to detract from the pieces.<br /><br />Overall impressions -&#62; I am a former accomplished Illustrator getting back into it. If you want motivation/inspiration on any level of expertise you will find it. Because the Artists come from so many different backgrounds (a good number not even &#34;artists&#34;) its just a good read. You can't read this book and at least not want to get a pigment liner, a sketch/watercolor journal, a 2B staedtler and just do SOMETHING.<br /><br />If anyone gives this low stars its because they were looking for an instruction manual, which is not the intended purpose of this book. The book whets your apetite to go and be daring into the unknown of your own potential to create something beautiful outside and in public!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I have read this entire series like 16+ books at least three times now and this book is one of my favorites, it is well executed and it does an excellent job of preparing the ground for events that will happen in later books while still having a superb story-line of its own.
B0028RXXE8|3.0|I wish you would rate this movie X.  Although, historically, everyone should know that the romans were sexually permiscuous, it wasn't something that I was perpared to watch.  With that said, I thought the series was done very well, even though some things were not historically accurate.
B00005JL96|5.0|I think this is a great movie; I haven't seen it in years and I wanted to get it for my kids; since I liked it so much. We ordered it (and it arrived so fast!) and the kids love it! My daughter and I like to sit and watch it while we discuss our favorite scenes. It's such a cute movie!
B008P9M614|5.0|Have only watched the first 3 DVDs in the first season, but love it! Would recommend the series to a friend.
0316067598|5.0|I've read a ton of books and this was the most touching. Should be required reading if you are an American.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Was sad to see some of the main characters die, but it really wrapped up the series that was cancelled waaaay too soon.  I keep writing episodes in my mind.  I wish the series would come back, even after all of this time.
B00009NQQO|5.0|I ordered this for my one year old and even my six year old plays with it in the bath tub
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Very good! I love this movie, it explained a lot that the Broadway show did not.  I thought it was was great that they used Colm Wilkinson
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So good. The graphics are awesome, the activities are fun, the training and shows are easy and you get to visit friends. Good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The studio should be ashamed of itself!  There are so many directions this series could have gone, if it were given a chance to spread its wings and stop being messed with by the studio powers that be. I am so glad that the writer went to war and got the movie made.  Isn't it time for another one?  Need another warrior?
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Knowing my love language really helped me understand myself first and foremost. Once I discovered my love language I knew why certain things seemed to be more important to me more so than to others in my life. This book also helped me understand my friends and family more than ever. Everyone should read thus book, by doing so we would have a better understanding of one another!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think this is the best game ever since it came out  and Jen tell me how old u r if u are nine and is hot tell me and I want to ask u out
B000SINT52|5.0|A must watch documentary that tells you the true unknown story behind the war on terror during George W Bush presidency. Thanks Michael Moore.
B0042RJWTC|3.0|I loved everything about this with the GIANT EXCEPTION that it is not necessary to show so much nudity, let alone sex, in any film that isn't rated X.
0070511136|4.0|As one who has sustained a career in sales for over two decades, I would recommend this book.  There are few sales books that are worthwhile. SPIN has earned a place on my bookshelves.  Perhaps it's obvious that the SPIN method addresses only one of them many aspects of sales.  It offers one of the many pieces of the sales puzzle.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book is a very great book written in a different format. I enjoyed it a lot. It's a great read!
0988178532|5.0|I had no idea what to expect from a title like Outview, the author's first novel. What I found inside the covers was a seriously wild ride mixing genre, dimension, physics and philosophy, mystics and intrigue into the thrill of pursuit. Nate's story of revelation, and the weight of his new-found consciousness and powers give him a convincing dilemma that is grounded in his human relationships, while forcing him into otherworldly situations, challenging him at every turn. This novel is electrically charged and will invigorate its readers from start to finish.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|Get rid of the scenes that should be rated X and the rest is fantastic!  Great, complicated story line with the character development that I love.
1400064287|5.0|I have a lot of appreciation for Made to Stick.<br /><br />In addition the book being great for marketing professionals, it is a great book for sales pros, too. In fact, it is a particularly good book for salespeople.<br /><br />In terms of what I liked about the book, I would cite:<br /><br />- Clarity of presentation<br />- Numerous and helpful examples<br />- Well synthesized<br />- Easy and enjoyable to read<br />- Valuable advice!<br /><br />Thank you Dan and Chip!
B005ETA5K2|2.0|Wouldn't work with widows 8. Wouldn'tpower up. Program would not load, program driver or utility Also tried unit on xp pro it installed properly but didn't have range described. Not as good as Alfa AWUSO36H.Buy the Alfa AWUSO36H instead, better buy also.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have always been drawn to this game.<br />When I finally got it on my kindle fire,<br />I really got hooked! I have several versions,<br />But I think this 1 is my favorite.<br />But I luv them all.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Did not have the suspense of good action movie. Lacked the ability to hold my interest. Actually found it dull.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you are familar with the well known pc, XBOX 360 ,and now poratable game minecraft you know its about the gameplay aspect not the graphics.I had heard of the game many times and then found this portable version on the app store for $6.99.It was awesome and attracted all my friends and relatives to this otherwise dull kindle fire.However i warn you its addicting while it can eventually get boring...the new 0.7.0 update is said to have online multiplayer!  a huge bonus and all updates are free so i give this a 5 star ...hope to see you all in the new multiplayer update !:D
B009EHDU7U|4.0|An ingenious inter-weaving of the life of the 100 year old man's adventures and adventures of his earlier life. Really a satire on significant events involving great figures in 20th century history as well as contemporary society. Cynical but often hilarious.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Heartfelt and timely.  This is a very touching movie.  Really enjoyed it.  Didn't know it's a true story.  Check it out.
B0064NTZJO|3.0|While I enjoyed this movie(saw it in the theaters) and bought it, I am selling it to a used bookstore locally.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I am a big fan of Kathy Reichs and her Tempe Brennan character. This book was so well written and I had trouble putting it down. I even learned things and was intrigued to learn more as I was reading. I would definitely recommend it to friends and fellow readers. I love mysteries and this is a great one. I like to pretend that I am there along with Tempe helping her reason out the who done it and why of it in the plot. I also love the tv show bones.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I got the book at 1 am and read til it was light out. Thank God I didn't have to go to work today! I love this series, it is fresh and like another comment said I cheer both sides on. It is very well written and the only error I saw was when talking about the family in an important part of the book there was no mention of the youngest brother, no biggy.<br /><br />Now I am going to sleep today. Either this book is short or I read a lot. Unsure which, I will go with I couldn't put the book down. I can't wait for the next one!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I like this game but I rather play this on the ds or the Wii. Plus I am really disappointed that if I wanted to play more levels I would have to spend 0.99¢ for more levels and if I wanted a different avatar I would have to spend 0.99 more for new avatars that the app choose. So I don't know why this app couldn't be $2.99 or less than to buy the whole app and not but extra for it. It very fun game but really do I have to buy more to get more to this app.
B004AX71EQ|5.0|What else can I say. This movie is simply awesome and makes the viewers think....what would you do in his position???
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Just got kindle, but have ps3 and am not playing it because of this love game upgrade system and endless hours of fun.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|The only thing good about this film is to see Marc Whalberg. It is a horrible movie.  Not only does it have horrible language, it also has a ridiculous amount of drugs.  I wish I could get back that time.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Good book can't wait for the next hope it comes out soon wonder what it's called hope it gets better
B00005PJ6M|1.0|I saw the first movie (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) after high school and absolutely loved it.  It was funny with a great story and fantastic music.  All these years later I purchased the sequel, and what a mistake.  The story is downright stupid and made no sense, and the ending looked like they were trying to recapture their glory from the first movie's ending but fell horribly short.  The ONLY thing I liked was the scenes when Bill & Ted are dealing with the character of death - in particular, them playing games like Battleship and Clue were just classic.  If I could I would edit out everything else and just keep these scenes.  But outside of that, the movie was worthless.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|the game was horrible! I couldn't do anything the lag was so bad. I did everything I could to improve game speeds but nothing worked. it even crashed my kindle! I didn't evn know that was possible!the game needs at least 6 month of improvement. don't waste your time with this.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Very good; quite intense. I love Ben Afflick in movies and think he should have gotten more recognition for this movie.
B0017HRCQU|5.0|This limited edition Batman movie was great for me to buy. Time the price on that was very cheap so one of the reason why I bought it. Customers out of there if you are a fan go out and buy one as well and you will enjoy it as much as I do
B001RZC4VA|5.0|Blues/grunge outfit Morphine is ridiculously original and talented.  The musicianship of the drummer, sax player and bassist/vocalist is superb with each exuding power, nuance and style.  How this configuration creates such sweet harmony WITH NO guitar or keyboard is simply amazing (the harmony is created between 2 string bass and baritone sax, with only a bit of over-tracking).  It is easy to see why many consider this one of the great bands of the 90's and why it is sad not to have more music from Morphine.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|My all-time favorite book! This is a story of King Arthur and Camelot all from the women's perspective. Written very well, easy to understand, and very descriptive! It is nearly impossible to set down, I think, but you need a clear head to take it all in. Many, many interesting events occur throughout the story. I suggest watching the movie first (only time I have EVER said that) because it helps a ton to understand everything. I definitely suggest adult readers or older children. Some material is not child appropriate or is just difficult to fully comprehend certain situations. I absolutely adore The Mists of Avalon and I hope you will take the time to read it! Totally worth your time!!
B008220C56|4.0|I didn't know what to think about this film before watching.  I have read the book but I don't think it is necessary to really enjoy the film.  The story isn't one that hasn't been told many times since but the way it is told is unique here.  The filming is done so that the story takes place in an old theater with scenes moving from a place where the viewer can see the stage and then disappears into the set.  It is quite different than any thing I've seen other than a musical film but I quite liked it.  The actors do a great job, selling the story and period well.<br /><br />The disc quality is superb in both sound and video.  As a newer film this isn't surprising.  The special features aren't much to write home about.  Just the standard fare.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed this film I'm not sure I would recommend it to everybody. It is a period piece at heart which is a barrier for most while the story is a barrier for others.  If you're looking for a good story with a great setting I would recommend it.  If you're looking for a fun, light piece I would not.
1451695187|2.0|Though I admire the author's courage in surviving a terrible illness and emerging functional finally, I do not admire his writing.  We are treated to endless names of streets, car journeys to and from his hospital, names ad nauseum of his relatives, children, wife, inlaws, aunts, uncles, cousins.  Ugh!!  His comatose state evidently resulted in his traveling to the \\"other side\\" where he encountered a beautiful angellike female figure with whom he became totally entranced.  The sort of surprise ending to the journal has the angelic figure identified--well, maybe.  But, wading thru a meandering diary which might have been appropriate for family and friends to read, was a real drag.  Evidently, the author, though a fine surgeon, felt devoid of love all his life because his birthmother gave him away. This issue was oddly resolved after his soul journey, but oddly devoid of emotional impact. Totally irritated, I skipped thru family figures and streetnames to whatever I could find that might be interesting.  There was not much.  Maybe the book will thrive at GoodWill.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the best BIBLE readers. I do prefer the dramatized version but great when you have vision problems.

B003BW0CB6|3.0|The parts of the story dealing with Harry Bosch were good.  The police side of the story were fast-paced and dramatic.  The side of the story dealing with the prosecutor, Haller, and the trial, was slower.  I'd like to have had less of Haller and more of Harry.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I loved this product cause it came in such perfect condition. It had no scratches and the case was in great condition as well.

B00AZKCU7G|3.0|This review deals not so much with the film itself, which is excellent and highly recommended. But there seems to be a disconcerting tendency in DreamWorks Blu-ray/DVD combo releases in forcing the consumer to shell out an inordinate amount of money just to get a few extra features which are produced on a separate disc even though there seems to be no particular reason (other than corporate greed) for doing so.<br /> The extras on the 4-disc combo of LINCOLN, while worthwhile and informative, could quite easily have been included on the disc containing the film--as, for example, they were on Universal's great new LES MISERABLES blu-ray (even though the running time of LES MIS is 8 minutes longer (!) than LINCOLN. One of the big selling points of blu-rays was that you supposedly have more content room on the disc than on a standard DVD, which makes the whole notion of having a separate \\"extra features\\" disc all the more mystifying.<br /> The reason I'm singling out DreamWorks in particular is that this is almost EXACTLY what they did for the 4-disc combo release of Spielberg's WAR HORSE. I say \\"almost\\" because at least in that instance, they packaged all of the  discs separately and correctly in an extra-large sized case.  For LINCOLN, the movie and special features discs were both simply jammed in together on one spindle (and in point of fact, the movie Blu-ray was scratched and skipped when I played it the first time).<br />I realize that with the advent of the Blu-ray format, we were forced to bite our collective tongues and go along with buying into it if we wanted extra features on our discs since the DVD version nowadays is increasingly the \\"bare-bones\\" release, but enough is enough.<br />In closing, I just want to reiterate that if the studios want we consumers to continue to support the Blu-ray format, they need to step up to the plate a little bit and not treat us like idiots who will sit still for anything. We deserve better, frankly...
B000F2QC1Y|5.0|The overtures from Rossini's many operas have been recorded very frequently, and there are quite a few discs available, all with different selections included. When I obtained this CD back in the early '90's, it had received Gramophone's highest recommendation - their review said that \\"the recording is as vivid as the music. This is a disc to bring a smile to the lips and make you appreciate life\\". I have enjoyed it since that time - the performances are energetic and the recording quality is excellent.<br /><br />Overtures included in this disc are:<br />- La sala di seta<br />- Il signor Bruschino<br />- L'Italiana in Algieri<br />- Il barbiere di Siviglia<br />- La gazza ladra<br />- Semiramide<br />- Guillaume Tell<br /><br />My other recording of Rossini's overtures is [[ASIN:B00000E31C Rossini: Overtures]], with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra performing a different selection of overtures, another very enjoyable disc (overtures included in that disc are: Tancredi, L 'Italiana in Algeri, L 'inganno felice, La scala di seta, Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Il Signor Bruschino, La cambia di matrimony, Il Turco in Italia). This was also a Gramophone recommendation and is also in the 2008 Penguin guide as a recommended CD.<br /><br />As a final alternative for consideration, [[ASIN:B00009KV0W Rossini: Complete Overtures]] includes all of Rossini's overtures, with Neville Marriner conducting the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. This is a 3 CD collection and if you want to get everything, it is probably the best choice, being the current Penguin recommendation and having it all together and with very fine performances and recording quality.<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Added Notes 4/12/15:<br /><br />I've just realized that this recording is listed on Amazon multiple times (not unusual). I'm therefore adding to this review the links to the various listings on Amazon, since each will have sellers offering this recording for different prices, to make it a bit easier for locating the best price for this recording:<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B000F2QC1Y Rossini: Overtures]] (the listing where my review was first posted on 4/23/13)<br />- [[ASIN:B000002RRS Rossini: Overtures]]<br />- [[ASIN:B000BR2PWI ROSSINI: OVERTURES(24bit)]] (sellers all in Japan, recording may be a higher quality digital version?)<br />- [[ASIN:B000E2ZOIM Rossini: Overtures]]<br />- [[ASIN:B00005AFRC Rossini - Overtures / London Classical Players · Sir Roger Norrington]]QC1Y Rossini: Overtures]] (the listing where my review was first posted on 4/23/13)  - [[ASIN:B000002RRS Rossini: Overtures]]  - [[ASIN:B000BR2PWI ROSSINI: OVERTURES(24bit)]] (sellers all in Japan, recording may be a higher quality digital version?)  - [[ASIN:B000E2ZOIM Rossini: Overtures]]  - [[ASIN:B00005AFRC Rossini - Overtures / London Classical Players · Sir Roger Norrington]]

B003UESJ9M|5.0|We really did love this movie,We love tge songs and we love the actors. we can watch this over again and again. thank you
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The Elite was everything I hoped it would be: it was intense, romantic, emotional, but it was also conflicting. There were a few things I was very unsure about and my emotions were pulled all over the place. But even so, I loved this book!<br /><br />The Selection itself is an odd thing, because it's so weird, and so... disgusting. It is so completely un-romantic. In The Elite, Maxon dates six girls, he whispers sweet things into their ears, and he kisses a handful of them... all at once (not literally, obviously). There were some very specific moments in The Elite where this really threw me for a loop. One example: Maxon is leaving for a while and all the girls are lined up to bid him farewell. He literally goes down the line of girls, kissing them on the cheek/hand/whatever and whispering sweet goodbyes to each one personally. It was literally like Maxon was a man with six wives, and that was pretty gross. If I were America, I would feel like my boyfriend was cheating on me five times, right in front of me.<br /><br />As someone who doesn't take cheating or jealousy well, that whole idea sits ill with me. But despite all my reservations and aggravation towards this fact, I cannot help but adore this series. It's like a drug. Something about the competition draws me in. Who will win?? But that being said, there were times that I just wanted to bash Maxon's face in. He claims that America is the one for him, but then why does he have to continue being sweet with the other girls?? I almost felt like it was happening to me, because the anger and jealousy were so strong.<br /><br />I started out this book as a 100% Maxon fan. I hated Aspen's guts for his reason for breaking up with America. It's so annoying and so selfish (despite the attempt to actually be selfless). But The Elite rocked my emotions in so many different ways, that now I'm not even sure whose side I'm on. If it weren't for the whole \\"multiple girls\\" thing, I would still be Team Maxon. But seeing him with other girls has made me doubt. Even though I have sworn to hate Aspen for all eternity, at least he's a one-girl man. Maxon is sweet and all, but it was so hard for me to stay completely devoted to him. I feel myself wavering!<br /><br />I personally still love America, but I can understand how she's not for everyone. America cries a lot in The Elite and she's not always portrayed as the strongest character. It didn't bother me much, but I know some people really don't like girls who cry a lot. I think I can sympathize with her though. I see the amount of stress she's under, and I just want to hug her. I can totally understand the love triangle because, in this book, I felt it too. I'm so confused about which guy I love more, so I completely get why America was confused and stressed and unsure, and thus breaking down into tears and hysterics. I got it!<br /><br />One of the things I loved most about The Elite was how we learn a lot more about how the country was founded. The world building isn't a huge part of the story, but it was a nice side plot to all the girl drama. The tid-bits we do learn are pretty morbidly interesting (does that even make sense? Probably not, until you read the book). But the facts we learn start to play a big role in forming America's political opinions and ideals. I imagine, and I hope, that they will also play a huge role in the third book!<br /><br />Yes, I had reservations with this book. I love Maxon to bits, but there were still times when I hated him. The whole idea of The Selection is kind of \\"what the hell\\", but this is one of those books that I just love with every fiber of my being. I adore it. I love it. It's my drug. This book, along with The Selection invokes my strongest emotions. It makes me cry, it makes me laugh, it makes me want to read more, more, more, MORE! I gobble up every word, every kiss, every hysterical meltdown. I am confident that fans of The Selection will enjoy this book just as much as I did! It will notdisappoint, and I must say, I'm super curious to hear about everyone's thoughts about Maxon! Have they changed?disappoint, and I must say, I'm super curious to hear about everyone's thoughts about Maxon! Have they changed?
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The state of of IT in \\"Part Unlimited\\", the organisation at the centre of this story, will be familiar to many in the IT industry - pressure to get systems in, pressure to get them fixed, budget (time and money) overruns, bureaucratic process designed to help that actually hinder etc. The Phoenix Project follows their progress from this state to one where IT is a a valued part of the business.<br /><br />The most important thing this book does is articulate how the bad state of affairs in \\"Part Unlimited\\" gets transformed into a Lean Organisation that is dynamic, accurate and responsive to the business, and provides a description (albeit simplistically) of how to get from one to the other. I would suggest that it's for the VP / Managers looking for a primer into DevOps etc; it provides a common framework and language for people of all skill levels to start getting deeper in to more specific topics.
B0047685I2|5.0|Always loved it!! Great movie. Nostalgic, romantic, good comedy, good for family to watch togeher. A must have movie for all ages
078322740X|5.0|This is a good movie and a funny movie with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. SSSteve builds a house for a girl he thinks he is in love with and then falls for a girl who takes it over for her own. Of course they have to scam family and friends first but it all works out. You should get it.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|I have been waiting patiently the next book of the selection series ever since I ended the first one! so needless to say I pre orders book two the elite and devoured it within hours of receiving it. This book has many more twists and turns, romance and heartbreak. It leaves you fighting your feelings about who America should choose in the end. I loved it, and wish it would have lasted longer....but it was just too good to put down. I hope you enjoy it as much as me, now I am stuck waiting for book three!

B00BCV3HGU|4.0|After much delay Willpower has been finally released. If you liked \\"Scream and Shout\\" or \\"This is Love\\" ft the incredible<br />voice of Eva Simons then there is plenty more to come. Guests on the album include Chris Brown, Miley Cyrus, Skylar Grey, Juicy J, and Nicole Scherzinger.<br /><br />Will's lyrics may not be the most original or his songs may not have multiple layers of meaning for if your looking for pop music that feels good and that can be played at social parties or on a beach this one will be a crowd pleasure. \\"Let's Go\\" with Chris Brown will be this summer dance anthem and another sure #1 single.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I used this book to guide me when uploading my novel and found it vey helpful.  I have not yet uploaded a book with any interior illustrations, so I can't speak to any issues on that.  I had no trouble converting the written material and uploading it.  I did have to make few changes on my cover design to upload, but that was because I designed the cover for my book before I read this guide to publishing.  Even with that though, I had no trouble reworking my existing cover and uploading it. The book is very helpful.  I highly recommend it.

B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Each character was too hard to remember from one chapter to the next.  The most heart wrenching was the orphanage and kept me reading to the end.
031618201X|4.0|The story centers around well-endowed (in more ways than one) Alexia Tarabotti. In addition to having to deal with the public's belief that she is well beyond the marrying age (she's 26), she is also a Preternatural, a being with the ability to nullify the powers of both werewolves and vampires. One night she is attacked by a rogue vampire but manages to kill him with her brass-weighted parasol. The creation of new blood-suckers is strictly regulated, and no one can account for this new one, so this presents a mystery. Where did he come from? And why are werewolves around London disappearing? To find the answers, Alexia teams up with alpha wolf--and potential romantic interest--Lord Maccon, as well as the extremely effeminate vampire lord Akeldama. Action and comedy ensue as these unlikely allies battle both bad guys and sexual tension.<br /><br />I haven't read any of the novels this is based on, so I'm just going to treat this as a stand-alone story. Despite being classified as a manga, it is in Western left-to-right format rather than the Eastern right-to-left. However,  the visual gags have a definite anime style (for example, characters will get comically deformed when they yell at each other). I'm no expert on drawing, but I find the art style of this book very appealing. The artist, REM, is unquestionably good at drawing beautiful women, and the cover illustration (see below) is really slick.<br /><br />I'm honestly not entirely sure who this book is catered to. Alexia's cleavage is front and center throughout, yet there is also female fan service. I guess that just means Soulless can appeal to anyone. There isn't anything too graphic in here, though; it's rated \\"Older Teen.\\"<br /><br />Overall, I feel the fusion of steampunk and manga worked out really well here. They are two great tastes that taste great together.
0618918248|1.0|Richard Dawkins is a very smart man. The problem is that he thinks he is G-d so that he knows enough whether to make a judgement. Not only was I an atheist, I was in agreement with Dawkins before I got sick. After copious prayer and meeting with Chasidic Rebbe's I received a miraculous healing much greater than possible through natural means. The Lubavitcher Rebbe was a known miracle worker. Go ahead and check out [...] to see the opposition. There is a G-d. Pray to Him. A very good book about G-d is the Garden of Emuna by Rabbi Shalom Arush. I needed a miracle to believe in G-d and I got many many miracles. Huge miracles. There is such a thing as faith. The delusion is that there isn't a G-d not that there is one. Every Jew reading this review will resonate with this verse: Shema Yisrael Hashem Elokeinu Hashem Echad. Listen to your soul, in your heart of hearts you know there is a G-d, and the truth is all You have to do is pray and He'll answer you. Pray to Know Him and He'll surely answer you. May Hashem bless everyone to know the truth, that He exists and that He is good. 600,000 people stood at Mt. Sinai and stood and saw the revelation of Hashem. It's the truth.<br /><br />Another good book about someone who knows there is a G-d is Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis a Holocaust Survivor herself, Life is a Test. If she can not only believe but Know there is a G-d after the holocaust, all of us can as well. Even having met such a person just once, one can feel the presence of G-d. May we all merit to meet such people and Know G-d.

0547572298|5.0|The story depicts the future (1992) as imagined by Dick. In it, telepaths are used for corporate espionage. The protagonist, Joe Chip, works for a company that detects these psychic spies for clients concerned they may have been infiltrated by them. Now, it is also important to explain that in this future when people die they are put into cold storage (\\"coldpac\\") where they are kept alive in a semi-vegetative state, and every so often their relatives can have them thawed out briefly for social contact.<br /><br />Anyway--Joe assembles a team of his own telepaths (\\"inertials\\"), and they, along with their company's boss, Glen Runciter, head to the moon to ferret out spies. However, it turns out to be a trap, and a bomb goes off, and Runciter dies. Or does he? Despite being told their boss is too far gone even for coldpac, Joe and the team begin receiving messages from Runciter in the most unlikely places, telling them to seek out a mysterious product called Ubik. This, of course, confuses the hell out of them, and to make matters worse, the world around them begins regressing at an accelerated rate. Everything--technology, money and even food--starts becoming older and older. This means that soon all food will become too old to eat. Why is this happening? Where is Runciter? What is Ubik, and does it in fact hold the key to saving their world?<br /><br />Ubik is a smart, fast-paced ride that has withstood the test of time (an ironic statement, considering the problems its protagonists face). I kept telling myself, \\"Just another pair of pages.\\" The book is a page-turner, no doubt. It has interesting characters and a not-so-predictable ending. And, as is characteristic of Philip K. Dick stories, the narrative stands as a warning about the unchecked advancement of technology, although in a slightly lighter tone than, say, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (the fact that Joe must insert coins into his front door like a pay phone every time he enters or exits his apartment--and the door gripes about it if he fails to do so--is particularly funny. I place Dick into that exclusive class of visionaries inhabited by Jules Verne and Arthur C. Clarke, and this could quite possibly be my favorite of his novels.nt--and the door gripes about it if he fails to do so--is particularly funny.

B004FHCH96|5.0|I don't give too many products a 5-star rating, but after watching Memento for the second time, I readily give 5-stars to this bewitching and intriguing film.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan directs this absolutely engaging film of a man with memory disorder who is hunting down his wife's killer.  Kudos to Nolan for the genius in assembling this mind-blowing, puzzle of a movie.  Guy Pearce, in his first starring role, perfectly nails the leading man, the forgetful Lenny Shelby.  His memories only last 15 minutes maximum, so he has to write down every significant thing that happens in his search for his wife's killer.  The movie unfolds backwards in 15 minute increments, and it is up to the perceptive attentive viewer to piece the puzzle together and figure out this filmatic enigma.<br /><br />If you desire a challenging, yet fun film, this is it.  I guarantee you will watch it more than once.<br /><br />kone

B0062OCNAI|5.0|I found this to be an amazing book. I absolutely loved everything about it. It had suspense, a mystery, the intense love a mother has for her children and heart wrenching moments.<br /><br />What started as a fun sports day at school for Grace and her children turns into tragedy. While everyone is outside, a fire starts inside the school where Jenny, Grace's teenage daughter is working as a school nurse. Grace immediately runs in the school to save Jenny. Both of them suffer critical injuries and are in comas.<br /><br />The story is told by Grace or I should say her spirit since both Grace and Jenny are in that place between life and death. They are able to communicate with each other.<br /><br />This was a very well written book with likable characters. I loved how the story was told as an out of body experience. It made for a very original story.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book!

B000BCKFWK|5.0|Sin City stays true to and respects the pages of Frank Miller's Sin City. I saw the movie when it first came out, with no knowledge of the comic's content. I just knew a comic book version existed. Years later, I collected all 7 of the Sin City graphic novels and just after reading the first novel &#34;The Hard Goodbye&#34; you see how faithful the film was to this book. It includes pieces from a few other Sin City novels and short stories as well. Scenes taken right from the panels, dialogue taken directly from the page with little to no alterations... and you would think maybe that was Rodriguez taking the easy way out, or that it would be lame. That seemed to be most people's gripe with Zach Snyder's Watchmen. It's actually the complete opposite, I think it's exciting to read it and then see exactly that in a film. Robert Rodriguez is a brilliant director and partnered with Frank Miller himself, and Quentin Tarantino... He can't lose. Sin City is a great movie for all, fans of the books or not. It's a dark, twisted, screwed up city that can and will eat you alive if you let it.

The story kicks off with an awesome intro and pretty much gets stuck into the good stuff straight off, it has a good story that sets the scene for our main characters to be there at the cabin, then all hell breaks loose and its scene after scene of the red stuff from then on, the level of gore in this movie is awesome, very good practical effects some are jaw dropping, there are very few CGI scenes but they are still very good quality and don't notice, the cast is very strong and all have a good part to play, the soundtrack is great too, there are several nods to the original with props and certain camera shots and dialogue etc, the new style of demon possession is very cool and creepy, overall this is certainly the best horror reboot anybody has ever done, a modern classic of its own that satisfies in every way possible, this is certainly one horror NOT to miss, make sure you watch until the very end of the credits for one final groovy scene!!
B00003CXBH|5.0|As I watched the DVD, &#34;the Mission,&#34; I was taken on a trip to a distant South American Country where a dedicated missionary struggled to save the native people from the cruely of the local government officials. The Amazonian people loved this missionary, recognizing his love and dedication towards them. The highlight in the movie is to hear a large group of natives singing in a choir, that echoed through the mountains and valleys that surrounded the mission. No choir that we know today could out-do the quality and beauty of their voices melding together. Children and young adults lost their fear and intimidation, by singing every day. The acting and the scenery are spectacular. Suspence keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats. The movie is full of joyful moments as well as high degrees of suspense. This story is an eye-opener, teaching us, who have so much, to recognize the povery and abuse by some goverments in distant countries. Go back in time, through jungles and dangerous places to see how hard it is to live in a land like the wilds of South America. Robert De Niro is an outstanding actor in this story. i can't help but watch this DVD over and over again. Every film library should have a copy from Amazon.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I really enjoyed the real life drama that the book portrayed. The human interest of one man helping others, even in the time of war was heart warming. Anyone who has an interest in the air battles over Germany would really enjoy reading this. Thumbs up!
B005529EI2|5.0|This is the extended version which offers a lot more back details then the un extended versions. I enjoyed it a lot...
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Wonderful story of an Irish family, their hardships and coming together in the end. I loved all of the characters.
B000RJO57I|4.0|love the dvd,love the dvd  i don't think a person should have to put on hers or his thinking cap if they don't want to
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I like it. Perfect for the price and I like the size real cool to carry on planes. You can even slide your Macbook Pro in it if you have the 13 inch. The 15 will not fit. But its very well made. I actually love it. And there are many bags similar but at this price you cant beat it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have never had issues with these alarms and I've been using it for over a year now. Wonderful app!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is great. It has fantastic graphics and I love it when the villagers cheer for you. This is the only game I have played over and over again. It is very relaxing.
B006OFN0BQ|5.0|The music in this film--about a complicated and not always likeable or honest yet powerful man--sets the perfect background for the times. Clint Eastwood is a jazz fan, and he has selected noted L. A. jazz musicians, including his son,  for the band in the nightclub scene. The soloing by trumpeter Kye Palmer in the scene where Hoover's mother teaches her socially awkward son to dance is particularly poignant.<br /><br />Although the technique didn't bother me, some viewers were confused by using flashbacks to tell the story of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's life.

B009G41CG2|5.0|I enjoy playing mahjong and so far this one is fun. It was put on my kindle which I use a lot
0446580848|2.0|Every other sentence is a joke.  Seriously, he constantly jokes!  I gave up a few chapters in.  I wanted a good thriller and paid for a comedy.  This book needs to be moved from mystery/thriller to comedy.  No thank you.  Sad.
B005LAII80|5.0|Never watched old Dredd movie(s) so nothing to compare it too but my husband and I enjoy this movie every time we put it on.
0688014291|5.0|i hate reading books but I had to read this one for a book report for college, this is a very interesting book, after reading each page, it gets more exciting after each page you read so most likely you wont stop reading till you read the whole book
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I figured this game would absolutly suck. but when you level up enough its actually addicting. i would recomend this to every one<br /><br /> P.S. you dont have to use money for any of it
B004P8A7J2|5.0|Shocking, real portrayal of how subtlety and easily substance abuse can destroy your life.  I found it mesmerizing, horrifying and yet it filled me with pity for the main characters.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Andy Whitfield was intense and awesome!  Really miss him.  What a tragic loss!  The show and his work were just great!
1452115567|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive this as a birthday gift and it's definitely the favorite photo book in my collection. I absolutely love the intro, it was written so honestly and wonderfully. It added so much meaning to the project and made me love Theron and Maddie even more. The photos are flawless, they look amazing printed in the square format in the book. I also love the captions when they were present. Very interesting to hear some additional facts about the photographs. I highly recommend this book. I will cherish it always.
B009NG1Q96|2.0|In all fairness, I went into this book with totally unreal expectations and experienced a massive let down. I don't know why but everything in this books seems soooo predictable for example (spoiler) in the 1st book you knew something was odd about Marlee and when see runs into the officer in the hall it just becomes obvious.<br /><br />The characters are predictable and quite frankly in some cases  unlikable  (In a book like &#34;The Great Gatspy characters that are unlikable are okay, but in a teenage romance novel it just seems stupid). The plot (if you can really call it a plot) is uninteresting and slow, which features extraneous details that only distracts the reader from important plot information.<br /><br />In my opinion I believe instead of The Selection series being a trilogy, it should have been one book. Moreover, the plot of the next book has already been alluded to; it will most likely feature the end of the caste system, the king being killed (or injured) by Maxon, the rebels making some kind of advancement and a more democratic government established. In a year we will see if I am right!

B009NQXXZ6|3.0|THIS BLU-RAY (DIGIBOOK) IS CODEFREE AND CONTAINS A GERMAN TRACK (INCL. SUBTITLES AND MENU)<br />German review see below!<br /><br />ENGLISH I was just wondering about this version of \\"A Star is born\\" because Barbra Streisand is playing Judy Garlands \\"part\\" (and because she has a great voice) and the get the \\"first\\" Dolby Surround movie.<br /><br />Well, both Versions are quite different. This 1976 versions isn't (for me) really a musical. Its more a music movie and I also don't like Rock/Pop-Songs. Its interesting, that Barbra Streisand has wanted to get Elvis Presley as Norman but his manager declined.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that movie is terrible - its just not my kind. Sure, the story is so far interesting and Barbra Streisand is good in their part - so I give a neutral 3.5 rating.<br /><br />Yes, its the first Dolby Surround movie... but technically it wasn't yet perfect. I guess we got here the best sound but for 5.1 Sound it wasn't really good enough in the concert Scenes (with thousand of people).<br /><br />The picture quality looks really good.<br /><br />The Bonus-Features contains a audio-Commentary with Babs.. but isnt really interesting and there are only 16 minutes of deleted scenes and wardrobe test of around 4 minutes and 3 trailers.<br /><br />I would say.. for the 2nd biggest hit in 1976 - those extra are lousy. Also the booklet doesn't contains really great informations about making this movie (even this with the first Dolby Surround movie wans't mentioned).<br /><br />FAZIT For those who likes 70s rockbands for those could be this movie interesting. Who likes more musical like West Side Story, Singin in the rain... it could be a dissapointing. For me it was OK.<br /><br />GERMAN:<br /><br />Diese Blu-Ray (Digibook) ist Codefrei und enth&auml;lt auch deutsche Tonspur (allerdings in Mono) sowie deutsche Unteritel und Menu.<br /><br />Ich habe eher aus neugierde zu dieser Blu-Ray gegriffen (habe den Film noch nie zuvor gesehen) da mir die Versionen von \\"A Star is born\\" von 1937 und 1954 bekannt waren. Anstelle von Judy Garland ist nun die grossartige Barbra Streisand zu sehen, die wirklich eine tolle Stimme hat und auch eine tolle Schauspielerin ist. Leider gefaellt mir der ganze Film bez&uuml;glich den Rocksongs nicht wirklich (ist nicht so mein Stil). F&uuml;r Fans von 70er Rockmusik/band k&ouml;nnte der Film durchaus gefallen.<br /><br />Die Grund-Story ist so weit die gleiche geblieben: der Superstar von einst faellt durch Drogen und Alkohol tief, trifft die Frau und Saengerin seines lebens, die dann ploetzlich selbst Superstar avanciert, in dessen Schatten ploetzlich der einstige Star steht.<br /><br />Interessant ist zudem, dass nicht Kris Kristofferson f&uuml;r die Rolle vorgesehen war, sondern Streisand wollte ausschliesslich Elvis Presley (man, waere das zustande gekommen, dann w&auml;re das ein echter Knaller gewesen). Jedoch lehnte dessen Manager das Angebot ab. Zudem ist dies der erste Film im neuen Tonformat, in Dolby Surround gedreht wurde. Da die Technik wohl noch nicht ganz ausgereift war, ist es nur dadurch zu erklaeren, dass die R&auml;umlichkeit in den Konzertszenen nicht ganz so gut rueberkommen - was ich aber so in dieser Form gelten lasse.<br /><br />Die Bildqualitaet sieht recht gut/scharf aus.<br /><br />Was mir nicht so gut gefaellt ist diese Hand/Wackelkamera die zum Einsatz kamen, um Authentitaet/Realismus zu erhalten, als waere man live dabei.<br /><br />Enttaeuschend an dieser Blu-Ray ist das Bonus-Material, welches, in anbetracht dass der Film 1976 ein Mega-hit war, doch ziemlich sp&auml;rlich daher kommt. Immerhin gibt es ein Audio-Kommentar mit Streisand.<br /><br />Ein eigentliches Making of gibt es nicht. Lediglich 16 minuten Deleted/Alternate scenes, 3 Trailer, und ein Wardrobe-Test von ca. 4 min.<br /><br />Das Booklet selbst enth&auml;lt mehr Fotos, Biography der Darsteller - aber nicht wirklich making-of Infermationen oder Trivias (mit Ausnahme von ein oder zwei Punkte).<br /><br />FAZIT: Fuer Rockfans und Musikfilm-Lieber (ich wuerde diesen Film nicht als Musical bezeichnen) der 70er Jahre durchaus interessant und auch die Story ist aber meinerseits nicht wirklich mein Geschmack.d Musikfilm-Lieber (ich wuerde diesen Film nicht als Musical bezeichnen) der 70er Jahre durchaus interessant und auch die Story ist aber meinerseits nicht wirklich mein Geschmack.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|If you are a Quentin Tarantino fan, DJANGO UNCHAINED will not disappoint you. But if you are not a fan, be prepared for a pure Tarantino journey into excessive violence, absurdity and offbeat humor.<br /><br />The premise of the story is offbeat, a German born bounty hunter (played by the delightful Christop Waltz) frees a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) simply to physically identify some criminals on the bounty hunter's list. Here is where you have to go with the Tarantino plot since it's as offbeat as a story can be especially as the duo become friends and work as a bounty hunter team. The ultimate purpose of this team is to find and reunite Django's wife who was sold to another plantation.<br /><br />Skip the plot holes and simply go along for the ride and an amazing ride it is. Tarantino never has a problem in getting top notch actors from today and from the past to fill his roles. Leonard DiCaprio, Don Johnson, Tom Wopat, and Samuel L. Jackson to name a few. Italian actor Franco Nero, the original Django from the 1960's spaghetti western, has a cameo. Except for sharing the same theme song, the two movies have nothing in common. DJANGO UNCHAINED is a Tarantino creation. The actors seem to enjoy working with Tarantino to make DJANGO UNCHAINED a pure epic.<br /><br />Set just before the Civil War, DJANGO UNCHAINED brutally displays the horrors and violence of slavery. The inhumanity can be unbearable to watch yet somehow, and this is the amazing part of Tarantino's genius, the brutality is interspersed with almost slapstick comedy. Imagine a group of pre-KKK hooded thugs arguing over the comfort and practicality of their homemade hoods. Only Tarantino could pull off this mixture of brutality and comedy.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is completely unrecognizable as the elderly and creepy house slave Stephen on the not so aptly named Candie Plantation. Stephen is the stereotypic &#34;yes&#34; man with his &#34;owner&#34; Calvin Candie (Leonard DiCaprio) except whenthey are alone behind closed doors and the roles are reversed. Stephen's devotion is again to the point of the absurd,<br /><br />The film is a Tarantino epic and it can drag on longer than it should with its cast of what seems like thousands. It's the journey into the absurd that makes DJANGO UNCHAINED hold our interest. This wouldn't happen in real life but yet Tarantino makes it all seem like part of the natural course of things. It is often an unnerving and disturbing film in its depictions of slavery and the violence. The moments of humor provide some respite from the horrors being shown. Tarantino's mind is an amazing jumble of images and only he could have made a movie like DJANGO UNCHAINED.
B0072OFM28|5.0|loved it!! just keeps getting better.  sorry it has been cancelled.  what a loss!!!  WILL MISS IT!  BRING THE SHOW BACK.
B00BDSRISA|4.0|It's been a long wait over the past four years, from seeing random video feeds on the band's website to random webpage changes and small blips of information. I give the group kudos for keeping this release so mysterious and cryptic for so long. But the main question remains: does this album deliver on that promise? The answer is an enthusiastic \\"You bet!\\"<br /><br />For starters, this is a more layered and challenging work than Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix. The finely tuned pop of past records is still here but the melodies are more intricate and lie beneath a thick layer of synths, loops, and samples. Thomas Mars' featherlight voice floats effortlessly through the tracks with the same sense of fun and urgency that helps define the band's sound. The lead single \\"Entertainment\\", complete with it's Eastern-inspired synths and driving beat, is a perfect introduction to this record as a whole. It's incredibly catchy and instantly won me over and if that sound appeals to you then Bankrupt! will probably leave you more than satisfied. From the dance-pop of \\"S.O.S in Bel-Air\\" to the laid-back rhythms of \\"Trying to Be Cool\\" and \\"The Real Thing\\", it's more than enough to keep you energized and fascinated.<br /><br />The album's title track is classic Phoenix and definitely one of their traditional experimental pieces, with the vocals only coming in during the last couple of minutes. \\"Drakkar Noir\\" and \\"Chloroform\\" bleed effortlessly together on a wave electronic beats and fuzzy keyboards. \\"Bourgeois\\" is relaxing and sounds like some of the slower numbers from the band's past. Everything here comes together to form a cohesive sound that reveals more with each listen. Perhaps the fruit on the cover is a fitting symbol for the record: sweet on the surface with even more to offer when you peel away the layers. One thing that did take me by surprise is the lack of an entirely instrumental song, something that has always been a staple of their past releases. It doesn't affect the record at all but it's just an observation that struck me on my first listen.<br /><br />This is a Phoenix record through and through, though not in the ways you may expect. Those wanting a simple repeat of the past won't get it but if you're open to new sounds and melodies wrapped up in a fun, clean, and energetic package then this is a definite purchase. It may take some time to fully explore this record but it's an effort that pays off in spades. It's a perfect album to kickstart summer and it will hopefully continue to garner the band more international attention. It's not quite as consistent as what's come before but there's more than enough to make this album worth your time and hard-earned money.<br /><br />I could make an obvious joke about the band being far from bankrupt of ideas but I won't. Wait, I kind of just did....ord at all but it's just an observation that struck me on my first listen.<br /><br />This is a Phoenix record through and through, though not in the ways you may expect.

B002U6CJCE|4.0|Unlike a lot of his peers in the action genre Van Damme seems to be doing some of his best work as of late. Universal Solder: Regeneration is easily the best in the series, even better than the first. As he is getting older, his face just seems to have more character to it, even without speaking much.<br /><br />You can also tell that the director really wanted to make a good action movie and not just some quick cash in because the action scenes are done really well(that opening car chase, that hallway scene...wow). The movie also looks really good on Blu Ray. Do not think this is just another sequel, because it's not.
B00633W614|5.0|Wow, I thought I had read most of Jeffrey Archer's books and then found another great book by him.  Story keep me interested and couldn't put down until the last page.  Look forward to reading the next one of these chronicles.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I love this movie. Everything about i good; directing acting, scenery, premise and on and on and on.Two thumbs up!
0452289963|5.0|This book is fantastic! I have listened to the book on CD nearly a dozen times now. The beauty that is all around us comes to life after experiencing this book.
034580404X|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES! OMG its very well written and has lots of blushing scenes but overall very well written. Makes you feel like you are right there almost or perhaps even apart of the scene.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My son absolutely loves Rick Riordan's novels.  This was no exception.  He can hardly wait for the next installment of this series to be published this Fall.  In the meantime, he has started the Kane Chronicles.  Rick Riordan never disappoints!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game.  It passes the time on an airplane or a doctor's waiting room.  It is pretty addicting, but it's really, really fun.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I luv this!!!!! The twists were very very unexpected and it was one of the best books I've read... ever!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a fun and family friendly game. Love the colors and sounds. Great price too. Please try it. Only 99 cents.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Another great novel by Rick Riordan. Never disappoints his faithful fans with his exciting novels of adventure. I Recommend it!
B000ME5B30|2.0|This was boring and though there was interesting information given I think it was biased.  Sometimes it was hard to tell if this was a movie or political campaign
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't put this down...good app and game. I love it!!!!<br />My husband always says put that game of and pay attention to me...But I don't. If someone was to hold me up ....I would say,&quot;hold on let me finish the, game first&quot;. LMAO
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|\\"We are not going to let that guy come through our town without a fight.\\" After a mess up in the LAPD Ray Owens (Schwarzenegger) leaves to become the sheriff in the small town of Sommerton Junction. Nothing in the way of violence ever really happens and he likes it that way. When a drug kingpin begins his escape out of the country he gets past everyone and there is only one thing in the way of his escape, Sommerton and its Sheriff. Don't judge, but I was looking forward to watching this, mainly because I was wanting to mock it. I like Arnold but the movie looked cheesy from the previews. Going in with that expectation I was disappointed. There was quite a bit of action in this and some of the lines were funny but for the most part it was just too boring to even make fun of. I'm guessing because he's been away so long that Schwarzenegger was just looking for anything he could be in. If that's the case I forgive him. If he had hundreds of choices and he chose this one then...yeah. Overall, I couldn't get into it, too lame to even make fun of. I give it a C.
B0042RJWTC|2.0|If you are not one to particularly enjoy watching others engage in sexual relations---hetero and homo-----If being taken unawares into the bedrooms of other people and invited to watch them have sex is not your cup of tea; if historical accuracy is important to you, then you should avoid this series at all costs.<br />The pageantry, costumes, landscapes and architecture are, as usual ----since England is now, basically, just one, huge film and movie and television set----good.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I read this book on my PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) I know, dinosaur &#34;tech.&#34; But it worked pretty good. It's different than the traditional movie. It's really neat and I reccomend it.
075669812X|5.0|Great book. My 9 yr old insisted on getting it. Yet it only covers seasons 1&2. There's so many new items my son has that are NOT in this book. Otherwise its great for the first few seasons since Ninjago began.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|it keeps starting over when i get a lot done. i hate that! i am on my third redo! so every time the game is wasting my money!
B003PVPXOE|5.0|I loved this movie. From the narration in the beginning to the up-close shots of faces and the stabs at the movie industry. I actually feel the themes are as relevant today as they were when the film was originally made. And the one liners....Fantastic film!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game but it isn't a game I could play for hours if you really like this game get subway surfers oh and the thing I also love is it's free
B002ZHKZEM|4.0|I have been a fan of Dr. Who since I was a small kid. And there are some Doctors I like a lot and others...not so much. This doctor is one of my favorites. I have all of the sets for the new series with all 3 of the new Doctors. All of David's work as Dr. Who is excellent. And of the majority of his series I must say I really like these. His personality shines in these specials. For the most part he is alone and you can feel that in his portrayal of the Doctor during these episodes.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, I have been a fan of the show for a long time. I have more than enjoyed all the new shows. However Mr.Tennant stands out as the Doctor and really brings the complexities of the man out. The character shines. If you do not have \\"The Complete Specials\\" I highly recommend you add it to your collection!
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this movie...I loved the books first however, so I rewatch the movie often!  To bad the last 2 won't be out until next year.~Anna
0547884591|4.0|This book will change the way you think about things, the way you analyze things, and more importantly, the way you learn and apply your learning.  I highly recommend this book and its techniques.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|this is a terrible Movie, it has no redeeming value, I got it because AARP said it was good for people over 50, NO WAY, it is nothing but profane language and gross scenes, the only people that would like this are ignorant low life with no moral decency, so if you are an adult don't waste your time and money on this sick crap.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is like, the best game ever! My battery dies all the time because I play it so much! I could play it for hours!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have every cut the rope app. Each one gets better and better. Is definitely worth a dollar. It is also very cute.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|For one thing I definitely I'm not going to recommend even my sister Serena agrees THAT YOU CAN ALSO FIND A JOB IN A GOLF CORSE  CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IS SMARTER THAN YOU
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a really fun game. It had a interesting storyline and was not so hard to solve the concepts.  The mini puzzles were fun and if to hard you could skip them without a penalty also the seek and find objects were not to hard to find great game
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|If I didn't know this true story had a \\"happy ending\\" I would never have made it through more than 30 minutes. Wow...so emotional and riveting. The movie does an excellent job of picturing the chaos and heartbreak of this event. I've enjoyed watching YouTube interview/videos of the real Mom who went through this experience. Unforgettable story...well told. So many \\"lessons\\" rolled into the story...and very well acted by all involved. A must see!
B004HO6I4M|3.0|The movie rio is a wonderful movie.but the copy I recieved skipped and freezed alot.  After cleaning the disk it still skipped.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|My boyfriend recommended this movie. It was better than I expected it to be. A lot of action. It reflects on how far would you go to fight for the one true love.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is addictive, and I can sit and play it and lose track of my time. I am glad that I downloaded this game.
B000UD08HW|5.0|Unbelievable sound quality and camera capture.  By far the best Pink Floyd I have ever seen.  Fantastic show on my 55&#34; LED TV and 7.1 surround sound through 32 individual speakers.  This tops everything I have ever seen.
111846446X|3.0|Even such simple items as how to power this device were missing.  It's a must have book but it could be so much more.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I already knew I loved this movie before I bought it... I'd see. It in theaters and knew that I'd be adding it to my DVD collection before the film was even halfway through. However, after reading articles and seeing interviews with the two young stars of the film, I was so impressed to find that this film was their acting debut. To keep pace with the well-known veteran actors without any prior experience really highlights their talents.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film, it's a simple tale of young, impetuous love... And all of the hilarity and heartache that goes with it.
B0072GPQ72|4.0|Wish it had more variety in the horse scenes.  The hill and no-mans zone scenes were too long and painfully dramatic
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a guilty pleasure that I really can't afford to have--it is such good fun that I can barely put it down!!
B003KGBIS4|4.0|While I understand that not everyone like Wes Anderson films, I happen to love them. I'm a huge fan of understated, deadpan humor, and Wes Anderson is a master. This story follows three brothers on a train trip through India. The complex family dynamics were brought out beautifully in the cramped quarters of the train. Great music and visuals, as always.<br /><br />I particularly liked the DVD commentary and the added features. Nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it gave a peek into life behind the scenes.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Beautiful adaptation.  A fan of the musical shouldn't be disappointed.  If you don't like Broadway/West End musicals, don't get this, they don't speak!  The live singing gives the acting a moving touch, as the play deserved.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I love Judd Apatow.  I really do.  Every single one of his films has made me laugh til I cried, and he made me love comedy again....that is, until this horrific train-wreck of a film.  It was boring, muddling, and fairly depressing.  The main characters never shone through like in their memorable \\"Knocked Up\\" appearance.  I couldn't decide at first if it was the storyline or the actors that were failing, but by the end it didn't matter.  The only reason I made it to the credits was the beer in my hand at the movie theater - definitely wasn't going to leave that on the table.  Good thing I drank too - made this at least a tinge less painful.  One of the worst movies I've ever paid to see.  I guess every career needs a box-office bomb or two...lets hope this is your only one Judd.
1452115567|5.0|I have to say that I am in love with Maddie, so I might be a bit biased, but- this is quite a charming little book.<br />I love the adventures that Maddie takes Theron on, and how he captures them for all to enjoy.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Very good book.  Would have liked a different ending.  Too many Indian words. Kept my interest.  Would read another book by this authoritarian
B008VBYN80|5.0|this is the best game there is.if you are a fan of village games i think it is the best village game there is
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This book has its good points and bad ones. I enjoy the world that the author has created but the writing was very awkward at various points in the story. The transitions in the story and some of the characters' actions are unclear and rushed. It's not a bad book but it's not great either.
B008P9M614|5.0|I love this show, and I don't need all the fancy extras that I'll never look at anyways. I ordered this when it was less than $90, can't beat that price.
0553062182|4.0|Read through a little and its just what I was looking for has answers that no other Doc. could or even would have even mentioned before.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Must enjoy the world of magic and fantasy. I am not a fan.  The story plot was hard to follow.
B005LAII9O|4.0|I was very hesitant about watching this movie. Not only I had heard bad reviews but I had read the tasteless reviews about the wonderful Benicio. I have been a movie watcher for years and in the past all the movies with bad reviews I actually liked and have been some of my favorites. This movie to me was amazing! The acting quality of Lively at such a young age and the chemistry between she and Benicio was surprising. It has an awkward romanticism between the three actors that some may find strange or flattering. This movie makes our heart beat slow and fast at the same time. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I don't know how I didn't hear about this prior to stumbling onto it on Amazon, but it's extremely well done.  It wasn't what I expected exactly, but it was an interesting twist or perspective to do the film through.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised with this after I took a chance on it.  Only thing that was wrong with this was that it wasn't a full blown mini series, I just wanted more more more at the end of it, hope they make some sequels.
B005LAIIJY|3.0|I really enjoyed Django ,had I known that the language was going to so vulgar I would not have purchased it. The constant use of the \\"N\\" word  and \\"MF\\" was just too much. I will watch it again probably ,but alone .I teach my children and grandchildren to have respect for other races .<br />I should have known that a movie with Samuel L Jackson would be vulgar.<br /><br />The movie had a great plot , good directing and lots of action . Way over priced and falsely advertised .
B000009O8A|5.0|i went to school with cami,,she was a pretty girl and still is at 65 yrs old,,she was a friend and i liked her..saw this movie in blockbuster 2005 and saw the name and wondered if was here..was i surprised,,

B000XUOIQ4|5.0|This has been a favourite film in my family with all the grandchildren and proved to be on this occasion with my grandson. Arrive in good condition and promptly.
B00BJS7104|3.0|This movie will only encourage racism and the use of the \\"N\\" word and a falsified and dangerous imagery of slavery! Yes, it was entertaining, but, as far as I'm concerned, Tarantino used slavery for money-making, and, if an African-American made this movie I would say the same of them as well. It glorified racism to an extent! And you know what the shame of it is, the others, don't even know the difference. This generation has been so badly tricked that they see nothing wrong or dangerous with what was done in this film, that's the scary part! How bad this empire is becoming. This, like \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" is an extremely dangerous and trouble-making film! Our families didn't die in the holocaust camps and our African-American brothers and sisters weren't forced into slavery to be used by Tarantino! I like Tarantino and his films, but, these 2 films will create a very misguided and misinformed generation.
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|Beautiful, timeless music, that transports to a deep and spiritual place.  Loreena is a truly unique artist!  Love every track
1452115567|4.0|I found Maddie thru Facebook, and I thoroughly enjoy following her adventures.  So when I learned about an upcoming book, I knew immediately I would purchase one.  Turns out, I ended up purchasing 3 of them. One for myself, my daughter, and my brother.  I love the images in the book.  Definitely a book to look at, if you are feeling sad or down.  These pictures will automatically just cheer you up looking at them.  The only disappointment I had was, I wish there would have been more writing.  A little \\"back story\\" so to speak about the pictures.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I got this along with the other 2 in the trilogy for my dad for Christmas! He loved it and was so surprised that he got all 3 movies in Blu-ray! ...he probably thinks I spent way more than I did!

1442354747|5.0|This is a clear history not just of Lincoln and the men her surrounded himself with, but how our country held together through out a Civil War, coming out a stronger place.<br /><br />Also not that this will happen to you, but I put in the first disc, started my drive to Gettysburg, and pulled into town right after Richard Thomas was reading the Gettysburg Address....cool !

B008673ZAQ|2.0|As book one, two is a must read... but be warned that book 3 and four will be total disappointments. So before you invest your time and money in this series do yourself a favor and read the customer reviews.  Although I had come to love and enjoy the characters and story line initially, Silvia Day ruined that. This story has become one of her dreaded series instead of the great trilogy it was announced to be initially and potentially could had been.  Crossfire started strong, Gideon and Eva's story initially offered, intrigue, passion, mystery, suspense, love, passion, s-x and interest.... but following midz of book 3 this story line began to   loose context, characters didn't grow and it just felt forced. Simply offering disappointment and frustration.   I have bought, read and stored over 600 books in my kindle, so I definitely don't mind paying for a good read. Granted not all have been great reads, but 90% have been. Several books in my collection are from Sylvia Day, but no more, I'm done with this writer. Unfortunately I've come to realize that if you start reading her books that you will end up frustrated and that your wallet may ultimately suffer too.   Her books tend to start with a strong story line and context, they suck you in, and then fizzle out as the story develops, by then you are several books into a ridiculous long series that you will regret investing your precious time reading, and to top, releases in between take way too long and you will forget what books were about often having to 're-read the book prior as a refresher.  Crossfire story was initially marketed as a trilogy, parallel or better than Fifty Shades of Grey...LOL! Crossfire series will be releasing book #5.... in another year!!! Oh pleaseeee!!! Enough!!!  So suggest that if you still like to give Sylvia Day's books a try that you wait until the series is complete and at best \\"bundled\\", because I made the foolish mistake to read some of her other series, one of which is up to release#18..... really! Totally crazy! She also likes to mix/entwine characters into her different series, so as a reader now you feel compelled to follow and read about all these different characters of hers in other series that somehow interact....  then you end up confused as to which series started it all and which one you need to follow up on next. It really is obsourd!!!    Anyway, it took me a while to realize her book game, but maybe is not too late for you. So please do READ some CUSTOMER REVIEWS before you start.  S.D. PLEASE JUST STOP!  YOUR LONG WINDED SERIES HAVE BECOME IRRITATING and INSULTING.

I was looking for something &#34;new&#34; after doing cross stich for my whole life and .... you can throw everything else out of your crafts room, put this book in the middle and start doing things from it, and your crafts  room will be full.
0374105235|4.0|Definitely, a good read for everybody interested in the problem of children - soldiers. And also an interesting perspective - we are used to hear that children are forces into rebel armies, to fight against the government. Well, it might just expand your view that nor everything is black and white like that....
B0096NCVAE|5.0|The Crypt Keeper will be rolling over in his Tomb over this LEHO master piece Halloween Scene!!!  A collectible I am sure with time will go up in value, why?  Because LEGO only makes so many and then they quit making them!!!  A real keeper, I highly recommend it!!
0061730327|5.0|Most of the time, when I read a biography (or I should say - I hear about a biography) of a modern celebrity, modern innovator, or - modern CEO, I am bombarded with the same story - difficult childhood, fighting for everything, overcoming the obstacles, fighting claws and fangs.... I don't deny this is the case most of the time. But it was very refreshing to read &#34;The Boy...&#34; where the main character - who overcame much more severe difficulties in life - describes them in an optimistic, positive way. Despite severe obstacles, in this description I still found some happiness in daily chores, some joy from small wonders.... it was a wonderful read, I recommend it strongly

1616551151|5.0|The greatest asset of Dragon Age is the writers.  The Dragon age universe they have created is full of political intrigue, racial complexities and religious re-evaluation.  This book is great primer for new and old fans of Dragon Age.  I hope this franchise has a very long life because the writers have laid a solid foundation for a thinking person's game.  Hopefully, Dragon Age 3 lives up to its potential.

B00CATSONE|5.0|The story of this guy is amazing, read it through kindle version was good, I strongly recommend it, especially for teenagers
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It gets quite challenging as you go along, but it never seems to get boring. One aspect of this game, which I love, is that you don't end up having to shell out a bunch of cash to keep the game going. They've made it quite easy to get everything you need without requiring you to buy a bunch of extra lives and upgrades. The option is there of course, for those who want to spice up their game a little, but it's not necessary to make purchases just to continue playing the game, which is wonderful.
B00316DDUE|4.0|This is a great Blu-ray disc.  The Audio track is Amazing and the visual scenes are so clear and vivid.  I would have given it a five star if not for the fact it kind of short (some of the scenes are not included in this release).
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I'm very grateful for two reasons.<br /><br />A) That a sci-fi show lasted for more than one season, and<br />B) That Falling Skies is an amazing show and deserves to continue.<br /><br />Falling Skies has an exciting plot that brings me back to many of my favorite scifi novels. I strongly recommend it and I hope that this show continues for many more seasons!

B000002OTL|3.0|We enjoyed the music from the movie...the only negative comment is that the soundtrack has some monologue/dialogue from the movie (i.e. Samuel Jackson's bible quote). That takes away from being in the groove with the music when working a 14-hour day!

044024630X|4.0|Lee Child is a skilled and acommplished crime/mystery writer whose most famous character is Jack Reacher.  The Affair is the story of Jack Reacher's last investigation as an Army military policeman. He is an officer but not exactly a gentleman.  I think there are three main themes in a Jack Reacher story: a crime to be solved, a beautiful woman to be intimate with, and gratiuitiius violence, but not necessarily in that order.  The world is a jungle, according to Jack Reacher's upbringing as a military brat, where the strong fight for survival and the weak are taken advantage of.<br /><br />The Affair takes place in a backwoods town somewhere in rural Georgia.  Three beautiful women have been found literally butchered and the killer (no mention of it being a serial killer) and Jack Reacher is sent to cover the Army's butt.  What he doesn't know is that it is a career-killing assignment and the main characters are not what they seem with a locomotive full of past luggage.  Reacher and Deveraux, a beautiful female sharrif, are the main characters along with Munro another MP, Riley a base commander, Riley's father, who is a sitting US senator, and Reacher's supervisor in Washington, DC.  Reading The Affair is like slowly peeling an enormous onion exquisite layer by exquisite layer to an unbelievable climax where Reacher ends the antagonists crime spree with a mega crime of his own.  The tension between the dynamic characters is offset nicely by the flat characters like the deputy sherrifs and the waitress in the ubiquitious small town diner.  The pace of the story is fairly slow and at times I felt like texting Reacher to hurry up, but Reacher is a force of nature and a law to himself.  He won't be rushed nor bullied.<br /><br />The Affair is a violently sad story. and the plot is fairly predictable for a Racher novel.  However, the story ending is important as it is the beginning of all the other Reacher novels.  If you like clever and interesting crime/mystery novelsinterwoven with Reacher bedding the beautiful woman in each Reacher novel, manly violence and a plot building up to a slow crescendo, you will like The Affair.  Lee Child is a very skilled writer who is very good at foreshadowing.  I can't say that I'm a Jack Reacher fan, but he's a wonderfully complicated and contradictory character who is very smart in a kinesthetic and haptic analytical way.  However, for every good compliment there is a caveat: Reacher tends to be violently and romantically predictable.  Reacher is what he is, and these well-crafted Reacher novels and stories are what they are.  The Affair is not my favorite Reacher novel, but it was more than good enough even though the violent ending is unbelievable in the sense that I am very sure that Reacher would not have walked away from it in real life.  An important theme in every Jack Reacher Story I have read is that Impossible is Nothing.
B008P9M614|5.0|it's House. entire series. awesome show. never should've gone off the air. and paid $83 for it. can't beat that.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a great read,but I have never found myself so mad at the heroine. She really ticked me off!  The ups and downs were a little much, but it was worth it in the end. Just a bunch of confusion to get to that point. Good job!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is addictive once you get going.It's a lot of fun attacking and collecting bounty so you can build up your base and army. You know you are doing it right when you find out that while you were at work or sleeping that your base was attacked 25 times. But you always get to retaliate. Good game with nice graphics and easy to play.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|As a former quarter using arcade playing kid of the late 70's I found the movie interesting and not too boring for an adult like some kid's movies are.  The kids loved it for it was action and video games haven't lost their appeal.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|&#34;Man Card&#34; aside---I'm hooked on Downton Abbey.  Okay, there....I admit it.  This is a really well done production with some great acting and some very intriguing story lines.  I wont admit this in public but I will share with those interested my complete admiration for the entire series and that includes this one as well.  Start with episode one...work your way up the ladder to this episode and you'll be addicted too.
B00BH413IG|5.0|Four and a half IMPRESSIVE Stars! Award-winning jazz virtuoso keyboardist Craig Taborn's latest trio recording \\"Chants\\" is a marvelous, adventuresome acoustical mixture of original tone poems which allow pianist Taborn, and the talented duo of bassist Thomas Morgan and drummer Gerald Cleaver to cut loose in what I would call very-approachable 'lyrical chamber avant garde'. The artist has stated he wants to achieve a \\"chamber ensemble texture\\" in his solo playing and that certainly carries over to his trio piano playing which expands even more so with his two cohorts. This is a musically rich recording that lures one back to gain insight into the music of an ascending artist who won three categories in the 2011 DownBeat Critics poll (rising star wins on piano and organ, and an outright 'established artist' win over keyboard titans like Hancock and Corea on electronic keyboards). The 'best of the best' begins with \\"Saints\\" with a mixture of classical and simple rhyme elements that swing mightily and shows Taborn's formidable technique. The repetitive propulsion of both \\"Beat The Ground\\" and \\"Speak the Name\\" tantalize and tests the listener's ability to hear minute changes amid a fusillade of swinging notes. \\"In Chant\\" is peaceful crystalline beauty with wistful solos by all concerned. And perhaps best of all a swinging blazing \\"Hot Blood\\" and the mercurial \\"All True Night/Future Perfect\\". Craig Taborn is one of the new lions of jazz piano to many of us, although at age 43, he's been building his impressive solo, sideman, and leader discography for 15 years now. Highly Recommended. Challenging and beautiful, captured on a pristine ECM recording soundscape. Four and a half INTRIGUING Stars. (9 tracks; time:64:29.)
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Yawn.  Oh man...not another kids movie.  Well, the kids love it as they love all movies.  I tolerated it as an adult.

B003B02OQ4|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars because it is definitely a page turner. Meaning as the more you read, the plot thickens and it will have you on your toes to found out what happens at the end. The ending came as a surprise to me and somewhat tedious, but all in all it was a good book. I would recommend this book to anyone.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I just recently finished this book and I really liked it. I just loved the relationship of the main character with his best friend and his best friend's wife. The story was really sweet and I couldn't get the Irish way of talking out of my head for days after finishing the book.

1452115567|5.0|I ordered \\"Maddie on Things\\" after I started following \\"This Wild Idea\\" on Facebook. The relationship between owner and pup is amazing and the amazing spirit of this dog is captured in these photographs. This is a great book to have on your coffee table and will provide you with a smile whenever you need it.

B005K17RU0|5.0|This is such a cool app, so detailed with enough weather reporting sections and the live streaming of quick forecast works great! Can't beat this app for free. It does and has everything I want in checking my weather forecast.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|While our return to Middle Earth is not as dark and epic, this is a very fun movie and a strong beginning to a following series of movies. The special features are great as well.
0439023513|5.0|With the exception of the last page, which I thought was just too short of an explanation of what happens between her and Peta, I absolutely loved all three books!!!
B001ILHY1I|5.0|if you never seen this movie then check it out it's very good racing action movie from start to finish .
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|hillarious movie, but it was dragged out far too long. you start to lose interest by the end. It needed to be half an hour shorter and it would have been great
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Al with all of Baldacci's books it was difficult to put down with a great surprise ending.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Keeps you busy if you like search for object games. The attempts at being racy are a little weird /unnecessary but somewhat amusing. Not for kids.
1451668945|1.0|I have read many books on my kindle but this has got to be the worst book ever in terms of format.  Every two pages there is font change and then the next two pages will have a missing paragraph.  Very frustrating.  I want to get a refund it is almost that hard to read.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The only only problem with this product is technicle.  It would freeze , and I would have to restart, this has happened in past purchases which I've said nothing.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that I just absolutely loved the first time I played it. Very original, great melodies and lyrics. Far better than anything Bob Dylan (to whom he is being compared) ever did, even in his early years.
B009AMANH4|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed movie.  Sound trailed off in a few places making it hard to hear.  Would also have appreciated if the movie somehow identified who the people were portraying.
B00007J4SI|5.0|As a piano player, I've always enjoyed the complexity of Scriabin's compositions - it varied from Chopinesque to contemporary 12 tone.  I specifically looked for &#34;Egoroff Variations&#34; and this was the only one that had it on CD.  Used to have an old vinyl with it but it was warped and skipped on the turntable.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like the story line. The graphics are great. I like that there are mini puzzles you can also play so it wont get boring.
1446303314|5.0|While this book may be shorter than some of her others, the concept of creating<br />her creatures to represent favorite fairytales is delightful. As always, her<br />projects are remarkably simple to create and are magical for small children.<br />One of her dolls and a corresponding fairy tale is an extra special gift for<br />your favorite small child!
B0002858YS|5.0|Having bought this multiple times over the years, I highly recommend this album to anyone that enjoys indie-rock music.  Plus this is on Autorip. This is great, because you will never have to worry about losing the album again.
B008P9M614|5.0|It took me a few seasons before I discovered &#34;House&#34; but then it became one of my favorite shows. The subtle and not so subtle quips by Hugh Laurie are worth the cost of admission. This set gave me all 8 seasons at a very good price, I might add and although I have caught up with the seasons I missed on tv, now I can enjoy them without commercial interruption; and any time I please.<br />If you're a fan of this series, I highly recommend it.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|This album has all the hits you'll remember from their heyday.  The only thing that sucks is this is not on autorip yet.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Is great put in addresses for several different places. Love the different ways to view the weather. Love the weather channel.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|The movie would have been a really good one if not for the n----r words. Wish it wasn't as violent.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|Reading through the reviews I see a lot of people are upset that this album does not sound like his older stuff. I can understand that. It's tuff to deal with when a fav artist changes what they do best.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's not like this sounds like an ABBA album. This is a hard rock album all the way. However unlike Robs older stuff, this album is missing all the Techno sounds that usually accompany his tracks. For me this was a nice change of pace. I like the \\"true\\" hard rock focus of this album. This album also seems almost like a love letter to one of Zombie's heroes, Alice Cooper. I say this because Rob sings and sounds like Alice on Several tracks. I like this also since I am a huge Cooper fan myself.<br /><br />If I had any complaints it would be that the album is short and that it ends with three slower songs. Good songs mind you but not adrenalin pumping.<br /><br />Note to fans though so you know where I am coming from. I like Solo Zombie better then White Zombie and I like all of his Solo albums better then the first Hillbilly Deluxe.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think a good book is a good book. That's it. But I know a great one when I see one. An  this is a great book. Read it!

B007XNAPX4|1.0|The actual concert is the BEST...but the so-called remastered DVD is the worst!  Instead of heeding to the negative reviews, I decided to view it with my own eyes because it's truly one of the best concerts ever.  But I ended up returning the DVD and purchased it on VHS with the &#34;original&#34; 1994 release date because the &#34;SOUND&#34; quality was so much better and I didn't loose ALL the artistic visual elements with the &#34;fake&#34; widescreen format!!!  The remastered version is not worth your money!  Peter Gabriel should care more about reproducing this masterpiece and take another stab at it because this DVD release is absolutely horrendous!  The VHS copy (even though it's mildly smokey looking) is still much better in my opinion - largely because the sound quality is dramatically better in VHS!  The remastered DVD's sound was actually more muffled and flat throughout the performance - and let's face it, music concerts are FIRST about sound!  So all together, this DVD is a huge disappointment.  I recommend searching out a copy on VHS (sadly).
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I love this stuff and It does exactly what it is suppose to do. Easy to use and keeps my temps low.
B000007XUQ|1.0|Unless you're a huge Carpenter's fan, you will not like this elaborate and lengthy CD very much.  I ended up deleting most songs from my amazon cloud player, and keeping only 2 or 3 from this double album.
B008M36EEI|5.0|I enjoyed this  movie.  I stumbled across this lat at night during an attack of insomnia.  Its a simple storyline not bogged down in complexity -  don't get me wrong this movie has depth but of the kind that seems logical and follows the natural progression of the movie.  i really enjoyed Emily and Ewan but if I was to be honest the Kristin Scott Thomas' role of the UK Press Secretary nearly stole the show.<br /><br />This movie is about a Sheikh that desires to bring the sport of fishing (a sport where judgement doesn't exist)  to his native land.  The movie is all about the journey of believing.<br /><br />I recommended this looking for a good fun romantic story - pure at heart.
0451228731|4.0|I do not normally read fiction, it is so hard to keep up with cyber security as it is. However Wesley McGrew recommended the book and he is one sharp cookie, so I ordered it from Amazon. The premise, at least I think it is the premise, this is a complex book, is that a video game genius dies ( are we sure Sobol is dead; this we is not, I saw Swordfish ) and leaves a computer program (daemon) that is essentially taking over the world for its own purposes.<br /><br />There was a detective involved, (Sebeck), but they frame him and kill him off ( not sure why and to say more would put me in spoiler land). As the book comes to a close we are down to two people with a clue, a smart pretty girl at NSA, (Phillips), and a mysterious hacker, (Ross).<br /><br />We do not really seem to come to a conclusion, but Wesley also recommended I buy Freedom which I did. Here is hoping we get to some conclusion for Daemon Industries LLC in the second book.<br /><br />I can't speak for the weaponry in the book, but the cyber stuff seemed to be very believable to me, I am guessing the author has some access to subject matter experts. If I was going to make a complaint, it would be how the US Government (CIA, FBI, NSA, DISA etc) tend to be cast as having no clue other than Phillips.<br /><br />It is a dangerous book for a geek to read, make no mistake about it. 632 pages means when you realize you are hooked, you are going to pull an all nighter because you can't put the book down. There is no chance I am going to pick up Freedom today, tonight I have to sleep and I have an important meeting tomorrow. Thank heavens for the $20.00 bag of 100% Kona coffee at Costco. First pot of coffee for the year, but I really need it.<br /><br />I just read a couple more reviews and I want to glom on to the points people make about the ending. It felt like I just fell off the end of the book. I wasn't sure it was me, but it was 3:30 AM. Glad to hear others have the same thought.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Great sound quality.  I was very impressed with the soundtrack.The organization of the tracks made listening  almost as enjoyable as watching the film
B008VBYN80|3.0|I like the game allot however there are major issues and if I had known that I would have thought twice before downloading and getting addicted.<br /><br />major drawbacks are freezing on kindle fire or other plarforms
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It seems so simple but yet I can't beat it . Makes me want to play it again and again.  Keeps your brain alert.<br />Kandyrush@rocketmail
B007N8RULO|4.0|I have played spider for years , but the other spider you have does too much moving on its own and sometimes wont let me make the move that I want or wont let my move stay where i put it.  There is some of that in this version, too.  That's not helpful, it's irritating!!  I will probably not use the first spider at all any more and the second one not as much as I might have if it would let me play my own game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just amazing and I could easily relate to Charlie this is an amazing book that I'd recommend this to everyone
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love these guys. The music is fun and peaceful. I love hearing the piano play and the cello. It is amazing what they can do.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a okay game to pass the time. My friends and me get a little out of control and to competitive but the thing is that I'm better than then which is kinda of no fun.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is very dark and twisted, but I kept wanting to know how it wrapped up.  Gillian Flynn has a gift!
1935597760|1.0|A very odd book. Extremely long and graphic about the orphanage. Jamie is poorly drawn. I don't understand how Jamie, after nearly 30 years in what seems to have been a civilized and loving family,can read only with difficulty, has no acquaintance with books, doesn't know how to dress. Comes alive with his music, then back. Slapstick humor--the wig in the toilet.<br /><br />I have no idea what the title means. Who is misremembered, who is doing the misremembering?<br /><br />The end offended me. Such an irresponsible rabbit from the hat.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Martin has created an amazingly realistic fantasy world with vivid details and unforgettable characters.  He is truly the heir of Tolkien.
0375851569|5.0|My 5mo loves his Seuss books!  He stares at the pictures, and watches my lips when I read.  I think it is helping him learn the basic sounds of English, which is right where he should be at 5 months.  These are books a baby can start with from birth, they font need to understand English already.  And they are fun for mom to read too.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|A fun application for my toddler! He's 18 months old and can easily understand how to play Level 1 (tapping on fruits). It's a great way for him to be introduced to numbers. We've not moved onto the other levels just yet because they're over his head.

0061474347|5.0|Originally posted at: [...]<br /><br />After Sabriel I really wondered what new and exciting things this novel would bring. And I was not disappointed! Lirael further explored many aspects  of the recovering Old Kingdom, while also bringing back a few familiar faces. Meanwhile the dynamic protagonist once again proved Garth Nix's incredible talent for bringing characters to life. This high paced adventure immersed me once more in the world of the Abhorsen, the Clayr, and necromancy.<br /><br />\\"Choosers will be beggars if the beggin's not their choosing.\\"<br />-The Disreputable Dog<br /><br />Lirael is a Sightless Clayr, who feels shunned and wallows in self pity. With her begins the epic quest of the introverted young girl who matures to a young woman and discovers her true worth. At times during the beginning I wanted to snap at her, I wanted her to realize that she didn't need the Sight, that her talents lay elsewhere. Early in the book the reader is exposed to her powerful Charter magic. Gradually throughout the novel she grows and begins to go beyond her childhood fears and dreams. My frustration morphed into pride as I became invested in the character wholeheartedly.<br /><br />\\"The visions are fragmented and a dark cloud spreads like spilt ink across the pages of possible futures.\\"<br />-Sanar<br /><br />The plot was captivating, another adventure that kept me on my toes. This time Nix allowed the viewers to view the story from two perspectives, Lirael and a young prince. This effectively weaved a complex story of the foreboding and danger that faces the slowly rebuilding Old Kingdom. A new and ancient menace is rising and Lirael must play an integral role in the protection of her homeland. In addition, the supporting characters were just as enchanting. I adored the Disreputable Dog, her loyalty and her refreshing excitement.<br />Reading Sabriel I felt like a newcomer to Garth Nix's world. Reading Lirael I felt like a citizen of the realm, finally understanding Charter Magic, necromancy, the Clayr, and all the Old Kingdom lore. I could only appreciate such excellent world-building while reading this novel. Any doubts I previously had, vanished. Yet Lirael cuts off during the interlude of the heroine's adventure, unlike its predecessor's conclusive end. So many conjectures fill my head, I feel I must read Abhorsen soon to satisfy my curiosity. At the same time, thinking of reading the last book makes a bit melancholy.<br /><br />\\"Does the walker choose the path or the path choose the walker?\\"<br />-The Book of the Dead<br /><br />I devoured Lirael in a couple of hours, sneaking a few pages here and there during class, reading during lunch, finally reaching an ending that continued to feed my curiosity and excitement. I recommend this trilogy to any fantasy or adventure lover. Lirael is magical, invigorating, and not worth missing.ing Charter Magic, necromancy, the Clayr, and all the Old Kingdom lore.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|My husband likes this movie, he says every time he watches it it gets better.they've played it on TV this last week and I think he has watched again and again
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This was a pretty good read. There were two things I had to get used to and they were the jumping back and forth from the past to the present, but I realized that it had to be done this way so the reader could get the full effect of what Catherine went through. Also, I didn't know the story took place in the UK and some of the verbage went over my head. Other than that I thought it was good and suspenseful. The characters were believable. I would recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the graphics are amazing and there is so much to do my six year old and I are adicted to this wonderful game
B009M588K8|4.0|I read it in a day. It is an interesting book to read and to learn more about what we need to know
B0064MGU98|5.0|I used to watch this show, but due to motherhood I was unable to catch the whole series. Thanks to instant video, I have caught up with season 1 & have moved on to 2. I didn't know how good it's getting! Julianna has been a fave of mine since ER! Loved it!!!!

B00AYE8C70|4.0|I think this is a good alternative to Skype.Best it is free. Highly recommended and a must have on any smart phone.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|We thought that The Hobbit was OK overall (a decent prequel, well directed).  However, there was no need to &#34;squeeze 3 films out of one average length book&#34;, in our opinion.  This movie probably would have been excellent if it represented the entire book.  Still, this film was enjoyable and worth the rental price.  The HD quality was excellent.
B001NIA27E|5.0|One of the last movies where they actually use sceince correctly.  It is a great blend of drama/action-pack/suspense. Highly recommend it.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Sad, almost dark tone to this story.  Not for third or fourth graders.  Maybe fifth and up. Not what I expected.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The original cable that came with my Kindle Fire simply stopped charging.  It seemed to be very loose.  This new cable which is actually for the HD version of Kindle Fire works much better.  It is a much tighter fit.

B00B4804KS|4.0|***This review really is for the 3D Blu-ray version. I preordered it and it arrived the day before official release :) ***<br /><br />My wife and I watched it and the 3D is very well done, they clearly did full 3D mapping with curved shapes for faces and pixel infill behind things when you can now see around them. My wife found it as good as 3D gets. As an engineer with image processing background I noticed a few things like artifacts around fast moving stuff and places where (of course) things would not be in focus that were not originally in the plane of focus. I think if you don't go looking for flaws it will just be a great 3D experience, this isn't a cheap cardboard cutout change to 3D, it's the good kind.<br /><br />The Bluray took a while to start up and then would repeatedly get stuck showing \\"downloading new attractions from BD-live\\"; until I turned off BD-live for the Bluray player. .... Update on BD-Live: It would seem that getting stuck at \\"downloading\\" was likely due to getting the disk before release. It never gets stuck now (it shows multiple downloaded commercials).<br /><br />-I.C.A.Q.<br /><br />(edited to fix some typos and clarify that this review is for the actual 3D Bluray)
B005HI4LLY|5.0|This movie is fricken hilirious! My family has watched it many times which is hard to say about movies coming out these days.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Nolan doesn't disappoint with this trilogy. Many thought Rises was a bit weak, I still enjoyed it. He put the Dark Knight to rest in a way most people couldn't. Plus Wally Pfister. Lawyered.
B001F12J48|1.0|I reviewed a neighbor's Polar Express 3D DVD and was impressed as to the changes in the original movie.  I ordered my copy and found the title page in 3D, but the rest of the DVD had a red ring around the characters.  I checked my equipment along with another 3D movie and found the ordered movie to be defective.  Great return policy from Amazon.
B00CBKXGPI|3.0|The game force closes when I try to fill requests at auctions. (Like, when I have the correct painting.) It doesn't always happen, but it often does. You can still play forward by just selling the painting to someone else, but you don't get near the reward you would've gotten using the request route.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is a terrific story!  While a lot of the elements are present in many adventures, no one has combined them the way the author has in this book. Part James Bond, American style, part Super Girl and part Super Woman you never know what to expect on the next page.  This is one that just keeps the pages turning.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book had way too much profanity and sexual content in it<br />Could not understand why Rowling would do this when she'd written so many good books prior to this.<br />It was a slow start and a sad ending, but liked the book more than I thought I would.
B005K17RU0|4.0|like the app . accurate information on the weather. the only problem is that it doesn't give rainfall amounts or snow accumulation. it would be a five star if it did.
B00C7L4QB4|1.0|Thomas Harris must be spitting up fava beans watching this. This show is hopelessly bad, a combination of cheap '70s slasher shlock and poorly, poorly miscast actors. Neither Graham nor Lecter are in  the least convincing. Their faces have no character, emit no expression or suspense. They are flat one-dimensional figures. Neither do the victims provoke anymore sympathy than inert sofas. I can't even express how bad, laughable the dialogue is. The actor playing Graham is probably the worst cast actor I have ever seen. This is totally dead in the water. I couldn't even finish half of episode 1. This doesn't disgrace the greatness of the movies (Manhunter, etc., all of which had their outstanding characteristics) as simply fail to emit any signal at all. Failure. F.

0763644765|5.0|This was purchased for a two year old boy. He likes the book and often picks it up and looks through it. I can't say that it's helping him learn to use the potty, because we aren't rushing the process. We just want to give him the idea. He seems to learn better when he decides o try something on his own.
0345803485|3.0|Okay, I have to admit I didn't buy these books and I don't plan to. I read my friend's set (all three). and I didn't read twilight and didn't watch any of the movies so probably have little understanding of the references the other readers talked about.<br /><br />Now, I think this is a solid fiction. Not literature grade, but chick flick grade. All three books talk about the relationship of ana and christian. And boy, you have to be good to make 3 books out of the thought/conversation of two people. Forget about the other characters, they are ornamental. this is about two people. Now the fun part: this book is a best seller because it's the guilty pleasure of so many people. All the female out there (married and single), don't you wish there is someone like grey? Drop dead gorgeous, mind boggling rich, ruthless and yet sweet, and head over heels in love with you, whatever you said about from the mind of two giggling teenager making the perfect guy, it sounds delectable good. Not realistic, not even close, but it's a damn good imagination. It is fiction.<br /><br />The sex scene is also a guilty pleasure. Don't you wish your sex life is that good? it's ok, nobody has to know because it's guilty pleasure. But it is NOT realistic, nobody have sex that way, but wouldn't you want to? Honestly speaking, there is enough of reality out there to last me three lifetime, I would just chill and enjoy this three books transported to a different reality with different set of rules.<br /><br />I'm not going to sweat all the small stuffs. I would let my hair down, take the fiction as it is, and move on. I heard there is a movie in the works, but I won't be watching. If I would make a literature review, I would probably read something heavier, but we are lacking in that genre nowdays. And I always thought F. Scott Fitzgerald made mean chick flicks anyway.<br /><br />If you can chill and forget about reality once in a while, this book is for you. And you can even secretly admit it'spretty good as far as imagination goes. But if you must have some kind of reality in your reading, pass these series.
B001CEE1YE|3.0|my daughter summed it up after we watched the whole thing.  It had been a long time since I watched these, but I really did enjoy them at first.  However, on watching them more than once, I must admit that they do not quite meet the test of excellence, where you can see more and more each time or interpret them differently at various periods in one's life.  (That is true of, say, 2001, but most definitely not for Matrix.)<br /><br />On the good side, the action and to a degree the characters are good.  We really enjoyed the fight scenes, particularly with the added dimension of the weird way it can occur in the Matrix.  This will stand the test of time.  OK, the CGI appears a bit dated, but it still works.  As this is the core of the film, it is fine and worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Regarding the characters, I would say about 1/3 of them are excellent, but the rest of them range from mediocre to, well, pretty stupidly unbelievable.  On the positive side, you have the human prophet Morpheus and his devoted acolyte, Trinity.  They are tough and interesting.  There are also many beings in the Matrix, such as the oracle or the architect, that are quite original and fun.  Alas, a whole raft of them seemed unconvincing to me, such as the angry commanders jealous of Morpheus' defiant faith.  Then there are weird characters like the Merovingian and Persephone, whose behavior is so inhuman as to be unfathomable and not worth trying to unravel.  FOr whatever reason, I can no longer suspend my disbelief while watching, which I regret - it didn't help my daughter that I found lots of their pronouncements laughable, e.g. \\"some things never change and some things do\\" which Morpheus says over and over and over.  I have concluded that much of the acting simply isn't very good.  I mean, did we need to see Cornel West talk in his pseudo-jive here?<br /><br />The greatest fault of the film, however, was that it acts as if it is making some kind of profound statement.  The film is full of flabby philosophical quips or cryptic references, such as the enigmatic babbling of the architect, but on closer examination, there really is less than meets the eye on the initial viewing.  After puzzling on it the first time I saw it, it now just sounds silly to me.  OK, there is humor in it as well.  Also, don't get me wrong:  I don't take film all that seriously, but it is fun to feel a sense of wonder during the viewing and it is completely lacking in Matrix.<br /><br />I say this with far more regret than disdain, because frankly I would rather be able to go with it.  I think of other \\"heavies\\" like Red Planet or Contact - somehow, they continue to succeed as a viewing experience even if they don't have quite the depth of 2001.  Recommended:  just don't expect you will want to view them more than a few times.film is full of flabby philosophical quips or cryptic references, such as the enigmatic babbling of the architect, but on closer examination, there really is less than meets the eye on the initial viewing.

B0016PM722|5.0|I gave this light saber to a friend's four year old son for Christmas and the little guy still thinks that he has a real light saber.  The base is made out of very solid metal and it feels exactly like you would expect the real thing to feel.  Everyone that has used it is amazed that it feels so solid and works as well as it does.  It reminds me of some of the toys that I had as a kid before everyone started making everything out of plastic.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I liked this book, because it is a one of a kind science fiction book. It had twist and turns around every corner.
B00AIJP9BS|1.0|I really like foosball and was excited to see a foosball game as the FAotD. I quickly downloaded it, but then had trouble getting the ball to move as I had directed it. I went to calibrate my HD Fire, and all that happened is I got a message to \\"Wait.\\" I did, but it didn't do anything other than make the Fire hang.<br /><br />So, I rebooted the Fire and tried again. Still the penguins and chickens (opposing teams for the game)do not move as you click/slide them. The ball may go the way you intend, but, if it does, it may be more of an accident.<br />Unfortunately, the game does not play as it should.<br /><br />I decided to try playing with my husband. There is just simply not a well designed game for playing on a tablet - even a larger one. We gave up on it fast.<br /><br />A tablet is not really a proper place for a two player game where both players need to tap the screen together. It would be a much better game simply as the player v computer. However, that does not really work, either, since the response of the game is greatly lacking. If the developer can get this fixed, though, there is great potential.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I saw Gary in Oprah and was intrigued by his book.  It floored me to realize that my love languages are Quality time and Gifts.  That makes so much sense and I could have avoided much heartache if I could have named this needs before.  Anyway it is never too late.  I am beginning to give this book as gift both to newly weds and people that have been married for a long time and have lost their spark.  Hopefully, it will help.
0393327655|2.0|Harris is, of course, entitled to express his extreme opinions in a free society. Thank God, those who hold other views are also entitled. He muddies the water with endless, overzealous reports of how dangerous all religion is, then he succeeds in throwing the baby out with the bath water by claiming that all religion is patently irrational, even sick and bloodthirsty. Thousands of the religious are spread throughout the world doing good and encouraging peace, healing the sick, and being philanthropic. We hate the religious terrorism as much or more than the irreligious. Please don't paint us all with the same brush. That is playing very unfairly.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|I've been listening to this album almost non-stop for a month now and I'm still just blown away with each listen.  Just a GREAT band!  Fantastic music, harmonies and songwriting.  So far, this has been my favorite find of 2013.  Worth every penny, but a mind-boggling bargain at $5.  Do yourself a favor and just give this a listen.  (Yes, be forewarned that this has a country flavor.  But that doesn't change the fact it is just freaking awesome!)<br /><br />Bravo to Kenny Loggins for taking such a wonderful turn on an already great career!<br /><br />Here is to the success of Blue Sky Riders!!!

0345803485|5.0|The enormous success of the book \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" among the Northern American women of 21st century confirms the ultimate failure of the very emancipation they were fighting for so desperately the entire last century. It shows the modern society, in particularly its consequently emasculated male population, the \\"bitter\\" truth about what does a woman really want.<br /><br />Let's take a look at the very first pages:<br /><br />The very first meeting of Grey and Ana. Remember this is two young people (21 year old girl and 27 year old guy) in 2012 we are talking about! At the end of the official interview he gets up, opens the door in front of her, takes her jacket, personally places it onto her shoulders, calls an elevator and with a commanding request to drive home carefully makes sure she gets into the elevator.<br /><br />Next meeting is in a cafeteria. He commands her to take her seat, inquires what she likes, buys and brings everything. There is of course not a hint for her paying her portion of the coffeee bill.<br /><br />Next, he sends her a brand new latest technology computer and a blackberry. His not-to-be-arguing-with statement: \\"the computer is on a loan... indefinitely!\\" means it is a gift and don't you silly girl even dare to suggest paying me back.<br /><br />Next, she gets in trouble at a bar; she is sexually assaulted by another man. Grey is suddenly right there out of the blue, saving her. She is drunk and affected by an alcohol poisoning; he cares for her as she was a child again with a commanding not-to-be-arguing-with attitude. She obeys with an obvious pleasure.<br /><br />The very next scene: their first night together, no sex yet -he does not even touch her! - but before she wakes up there is a high quality expensive underwear and clothes delivered specifically for her by Grey's order. She opens her mouth \\"I should probably pay you for these clothes\\" but he silences her with one look. He orders a breakfast for her, makes sure she has everything she might possibly need and personally drives her home. He kisses her hand as a goodbye. She asks him \\"Which medieval chronicle did you run away from, Sir Knight?\\" His response suggests to a female reader \\"I am a real man, baby, get used to it.\\"<br /><br />He takes her out on a dinner, an exclusive restaurant, a private room just for them. He orders from the menu for her, pays -of course!-this time she does not even open her mouth on the matter. Clearly, such actions would emasculate her \\"real man\\". He gets up mannerly from the table as soon as she gets up. She goes \\"Oh my, those manners!\\" He walks her to her car; it is cold outside so he immediately takes off his jacket and places it onto her shoulders. \\"I don't want you to catch a cold, baby.\\" He looks at the old car she drives and chuckles. Arrogant Bastard! she thinks. \\"You are NOT buying me a new car!\\" she protests. \\"We'll see about that.\\" He replies. And here we go, next morning she gets a brand new Audi from him. Your car is not safe, he says. I want you safe. She kisses him on a cheek. \\"Thank you, Sir.\\"<br /><br />Grey declares openly \\"You. Are. Mine. And I take good care of what is mine.\\" This is it. By this point he can be old and ugly as hell, she would not care. \\"She. Is. His.\\" She got what any modern woman truly wants deep inside of her emancipated soul:<br /><br />1. Absolute Male Domination- to feel a woman,<br />2. Protection - sorry, but is not this what men were made for?<br />3. Care -to feel cherished.<br />3. Classical Gentleman Manners- to flatter her femininity.<br />4. Ultimate Financial Generosity- to feel worthy.<br /><br />The Prince Charming in this book comes even with more additional bonuses: he is brilliant, competent in everything, not just rich, obscenely rich, hot and sexy like hell, athletic like an Olympic champion, and- oh my!- handsome like a Greek God. One can only imaging his penis size! Those bonuses are all nice but not necessary. As I mentioned above, she would be already entirely \\"his\\" by now.<br /><br />Finally, the time comes for the extra-bonus Prince Charming Grey to place his indecent proposal in front of Ana. The proposal symbolizes the ugly truth that for many centuries keeps forming the strongest male-female unions. No, NOT the Equal Partners. Sorry! What he really wants with her is a \\"Dominant - Submissive Contract\\". The details of the contract they discuss and ultimately proceed with should not be taken literary. Her agreement to the proposal answers quite explicitly the question the men keep asking: what does the woman really want? The ugly truth is simple, prove to me that you are a worthy male, a Dominant and I'll be more than happy to submit to you, let you \\"own\\" me ... moreover, this is exactly what I want.<br /><br />The end of chapter 7:<br /><br />\\"If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you. If you don't, I shell punish you. I will gain a great deal of pleasure, joy even, in your submission. The more you submit, the greater my joy-it's a very simple equation.\\"<br />\\"Okay, and what do I get out of this?\\"<br />\\"Me.\\" He says simply.<br /><br />Reading this I wonder: Come on Ana, what are you still thinking about? Who would not want a man like this?! And this is exactly what goes through her mind: \\"Oh, I'll do anything for this man.\\" The end of the story....<br /><br />A reminder once again, we are talking about an emancipated, university graduate, the 21 year old girl living in the USA in year 2012. To make my point even more so, I have a university degree too and I keep reading the book over and over despite my husband telling me that such read and the addiction to it is really beneath me. Well, as embarrassing as it is, one can't argue with what the soul truly wants. A woman was shaped by nature to submit to a worthy male - the Dominant. Charles Darwin would give a very good lecture on the subject.<br /><br />This is the reason the book has made such a shock-wave success among the femalepopulation of the Northern America. This is the reason one half of the female readers loves the book (admitting the ugly truth), another half hates the book (denies it). It is also no surprise that there are no opinions in between.<br /><br />I think this book, despite of its shallow plot, poor writing style, poorly developed characters and amassed exaggerations should be nevertheless used in social studies as a textbook. Just remove the sex scenes - although the scenes are shocking and delightful, Fifty Shades is really not about sex. This way you will get a an explicit manual- \\"What does the woman want\\".
B007X4ECLY|5.0|A movie that is so bad it's good. Bought for my husband because he wanted it on blu ray. Yay.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|This was a gift to a friend who was a fan of the movies who also (now) loves the series. We have watched the episodes many times.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Great show.  I hope it's around for a long time.  Very funny and entertaining show.  The Cast is perfect together
B0060MYM3S|5.0|There is nothing bad I can say about season 2 except that I immediately wanted season 3 and on. The costumes, the acting, the scenery is so good it makes you feel like you are there. Extremely impressive cast!
B002BWCJOA|1.0|A bit scary, even for an adult, I'm glad that I watched it before allowing any one child to watch it or I would have been in major trouble!
B005ERWYH6|5.0|I love this album.  What a terrific voice.  I have put it on my computer and listen to it almost every day.  Just love to hear her sing.  Bonnie
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|I love Plex. It works well on all my computers and devices, EXCEPT on the Kindle Fire. The frame rate when I try to watch a video via Plex on my KF appears to be about 15 fps. It jerks and lurches, then it freezes up periodically. I have combed the internet looking for an answer, and what I find is that a lot of others complain of the problem, but no-one seems to have a solution. I have tried the published solutions that I have found, but none works. I hope Kindle or Plex will eventually fix this problem. In the meantime, I wish I had saved my five bucks.
6304712944|5.0|I fell in love with this movie when it debuted, long before dvds made it possible to have your own copy.  I went to see it when it was re-released in the seventies on the big screen.  Vanessa Redgrave was gorgeous, Richard Harris so moving in his performance.  The music is the real treasure and just brings this classic story together in a way that you will want to watch again and again.  It is hard to believe that Franco Nero spoke no English when he did this part, but that is one of the many bits of information you find in the extras.  The second dvd has so much that you will want to watch.  I remember when the movie started a trend in fashion and this too is touched upon in the extras.  Although it cost a bit more, I feel this extra disc is well worth it and gives so much information.  All the songs are wonderful.  If ever I would Leave You is my favorite.  Myself, I was so much in love with Arthur I could never understand why his Ginny would prefer Lancelot.  But the emotion is palatable as he struggles with his rage and compassion.  My all time favorite musical.  You won't regret owning this fabulous film.
0385528752|5.0|If you're interested in change, this is the book to buy.  Loaded with interesting studies and sensible steps on how to accomplish change, this book  is good value for your money.
B00BGI076M|4.0|When I first started watching I fell in LOVE with this show.  After some time..it became less believable.  I still think it's a great show, better than most BS on tv.  However, it has become predictable and a little bit excessive.  They've strayed away from the Edgar Allan Poe theme in the last half of the series, and focused more on how stupid the FBI is... If the FBI is this ignorant, everyone should own a semi-automatic because we are screwed (hence only 4 stars).  I like dark shows, and this one provides twists and turns that the viewer can't always imagine, so I respect the need to create a good amount of AH HA moments.  And if you're going to rot your brain, why not watch something that has an overall plot that's been thought out and developed!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Good mini games, interesting story arc and eye candy -like graphics. I would really like to play another one like this.
0812992784|5.0|I really like the author's fiction.  I don't rank it as my absolute favorite but I love its vivid imagery, imagination and heart.  I love his biography and may rank it among my all time favorite books ever.<br /><br />If you want to know how a struggling author becomes a bestseller.  If you want to know how an outsider integrates into a new society.  If you want to mix arrogance, personality and personality, life and pain and contradictions and keep your sanity....read this book.<br /><br />It defies description.  Novelists write the best autobiographies.  Amazing.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This was a great deal I got the cd and digital copy for 9.99 and free shipping. The album is different but I love Paramore and have loved all their albums. Sure bands change sound and direction it doesn't mean they're gone so open your ears and listen :)
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Riveting series from beginning to end. Don't know how come it took me so long to start! Highly recommended. Great plot with so many subplots.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever! Cute, creative and my grandkids and I just cannot get enough! The characters are sooooo well done!
B0008ENICU|5.0|This is a very good, very clever, bitter sweet \\"romantic comedy\\", made in 1939, a time when neither romantic comedies nor the political correctness existed. Below some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />As you probably already know, this film is COMPLETELY devoided of men! Not even one man appears on the screen - EVER! Even cats and dogs which appear in this film are all females! And at 2 hours 13 minutes this is a long film... And yet, even if they are so conspicuosly absent, men are nevertheless extremely present...)))<br /><br />The scenario of this film is an adaptation of a play and it is clearly visible - and this is one of the strongest points of this film, as it makes it completely focused on witty, clever, fast, brilliant and sometimes pretty cruel dialogs. Once again, this is a long film - but believe me, you will not see the time pass! All actresses perform at the top of their abilities and they are a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />But the greatest treasure of this film is the absolute lack of political correctness (and it begins with the opening titles)! If anybody tried to make this film today, with the same dialogs and solutions, well, I think the feminist/politically correct crowd would probably lynch him/her and throw what is left to piranhas! And this is a MAJOR reason to buy, watch and keep this film.<br /><br />Joan Crawford is a particular delight in this film, playing (what a surprise) an evil, dark hearted gold digger - but still, I appreciated very much that at the end she had the final word - well, kind of...))) Believe me, it is worthy to watch this long film to the very end even if you have to retain just the scene in which Joan Crawford has the final word...)))!<br /><br />Amongst the treasures of this film are also a heavy drinking scene, a wonderful catfight (honestly, even better than any of Krystle vs. Alexis scenes in \\"Dynasty\\"), lots of wonderful gossiping scenes and many, many others.<br /><br />This film is also a terrible indictement against the divorce, reminding us of the heavy price always paid by the principal victims - the children...<br /><br />Bottom line, I loved this film, I am so happy that I bought and watched it and I will keep it preciously for future viewings. Enjoy!is also a terrible indictement against the divorce, reminding us of the heavy price always paid by the principal victims - the children...<br /><br />Bottom line, I loved this film, I am so happy that I bought and watched it and I will keep it preciously for future viewings. Enjoy!
B00B01XDTI|5.0|I really liked the second movie, it seemed a little bit lower budget but still if you were a fan of the first movie then I'm sure you will love the second.
086571701X|5.0|I like the way this book starts out with very basic ideas and guides the reader through to actually setting up a very workable system.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I liked this book so much i bought the audiobook, the Book and the Kindle edition for my wife!!<br />Stephen if you are reading this, Thank You Very much!!  You are a great writer, keep on keeping on!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've used this on two knives and it does a good job for my needs,which are pretty basic. Just raise the back of the handle and push down as you draw it back,,only raise and push down enough to feel a little resistance as the blades do their job. Then pull it gently(feel less resistance than the first V)through the second V to dress the edge a bit.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I loved the books...the movies are okay...Some people never will read the books, so at least these are good movies.
B005I4JG80|3.0|I'm french and enjoyed reading about my own culture. A lot of true things but some statements are exaggerated about how most children behave so well out there...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I actually came upon this game buy accident and it was well worth it!  I did not want this one to end.  Very good graphics and challenging puzzles.  Can't wait until they come out with the next one!
B00386EZJU|5.0|I love the CD and I love John Powell's music.  The CD sounds great and I'm looking forward to the music for HTTYD 2.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|It takes a creative mind to weave such a plot. Took me almost the whole book to sort out the players.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I was excited when I bought it but when but when I hit install it would not lt me at all. Now I spent my money on something I can not even uses.
1432794426|5.0|This is it! The book that I am proud to have on my bookshelf. This book is written with the right intention to create a win win situation, the reader, the writer and whom it is about. It is wonderful and respectful story on Michael, well researched. It brought love, positivity and hope into my life. It is one of the books that is a joy to read over and over again. ♥
B009FZFONO|5.0|Thank you, Amazon, for enabling my The Walking Dead addiction with commercial free episodes delivered the day after it aired on AMC!  I'm Deaf, so I loved that everything was accessible with optional captioning, in High Def, and viewable on my Roku-supported TV, iPad, or MacBook.  I will definitely be renewing this for the next season.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game really fun to play. Easy to learn very for everyone to play. Fun for anyone. Especially if you like horses.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|The series is excellent.  A little graphic for my taste. We enjoy history very much.  we are looking forward to season three
B0058VW36U|5.0|I blame my friend for getting me hooked on this. Now I just can't stop playing it! A must buy!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Loved the movie and thought I understood untill the end. ( where the reporters wanted another story to publish ) I will watch it over and over
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have been playing this game for a year now and unless I befriend other players,  I will not be able to get the last piece to complete the city. The game constantly freezes up and slows down and I lose before it unfreezes
0345803485|1.0|I decided to read this book after hearing all the hype about it and thought it would be really good. WRONG! Fifty Shades IS NOT a good read! The writing is weak and there are grammar errors, the book is REPETITIVE, and there is absolutely no plot (other than their FABULOUS sex). Really? I was completely bored with it by Chapter 5 and it actually took me a while to finish, though I'm not sure why I even bothered. I can't imagine reading the entire trilogy. Did I mention this book is REPETITIVE? Same verbiage and phrases, over and over again. To the author...if you're going to write a book, at least be a LITTLE creative and have a strong plot/story line (other than sex). Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time reading this. Your \\"inner goddess\\" will thank you.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I do not like reading sad books , luckily I read this.<br />I cryed a lot, I laughed, and finish the book in peace and feelin grateful for having read it.<br />You can't miss it.<br />It is the second book I read by Colleen Hoover and twice she surprised me ... thanks
0061950726|5.0|Story Description:<br /><br />HarperCollins Publishers March 25, 2013 Trade Paperback ISBN: 978-0-06-195072-8<br /><br />Between 1854 and 1929, so-called orphan trains ran regularly from the cities of the East Coast to the farmlands of the Midwest, carrying thousands of abandoned children whose fates would be determined by pure luck.  Would they be adopted by a kind and loving family, or would they face a childhood and adolescence of hard labor and servitude?<br /><br />As a young Irish immigrant, Vivian Daly was one such child, sent by rail from New York City to an uncertain future a world away.  Returning east later in life, Vivian leads a quiet, peaceful existence on the coast of Maine, the memories of her upbringing rendered by a hazy blur.  But in her attic, hidden in trunks, are vestiges of a turbulent past.<br /><br />Seventeen-year-old Molly Ayer knows that a community-service position helping an elderly widow clean out her attic is the only thing keeping her out of juvenile hall.  But as Molly helps Vivian sort through her keepsakes and possessions, she discovers that she and Vivian aren't as different as they appear.  A Penobscot Indian who has spent her youth in and out of foster homes, Molly is also an outsider being raised by strangers, and she, too, has unanswered questions about the past.<br /><br />Moving between contemporary Maine and Depression-era Minnesota, Orphan Train is a powerful tale of upheaval and resilience, second chances, and unexpected friendship.<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />Seventeen-year-old Molly lives with her foster parents, Dina and Ralph in Spruce Harbor, Maine.  Dina wasn't all that excited about having Molly as a foster child as their last one tried to set the school on fire, but husband Ralph wanted her.  Having been through the Big Brother's program as a child himself, he felt he had something to offer Molly.  But Molly isn't surprised Dina didn't want her because not much ever went right in her life.  At school she was an outcast because she dresses goth, that is, until she meets Jack during a school work group.  Jack liked her and thought she was \\"awesome\\" which made Molly smile.<br /><br />Jack's mother works for an elderly woman, Vivian Daly who is ninety-one-years-old.  She wants someone to help her clean out her attic and Jack's mother doesn't want to do it so she offers the opportunity to Molly after Jack convinces her that Molly is trustworthy.  Molly takes on the chore as she can complete her fifty hours of community service instead of going to juvenile hall for stealing something and it gives her an excuse to stay with Dina and Ralph.<br /><br />Vivian Daly was only seven-years-old when she came to America from Ireland in 1929 with her family.  However, she ended up in the care of the Children's Aid Society just three years later after losing her family.  Shortly after her arrival there, she found herself seated on a train called the \\"orphan train\\" which was bound for the countryside and out of the big city of New York.  There were hundreds of children on the train with her, all bound for farmland and new families, that is, if any picked them out of the line-up.<br /><br />I felt so very sorry for Vivian when she was living in the Grote household.  The deplorable conditions under which she was forced to live were heartbreaking.  I cried when I read the passage about something horrible that happened to her in that house.  I wanted so badly to reach into the pages of the story, put my arms around her, and rip her out of that situation.  Then, being forced to walk so, so far in the dead of winter was totally unacceptable.  What cruel and heartless people they were.<br /><br />As Molly and Vivian continue to clean the attic, each box opened brings back another memory and another amazing story from Vivian.  It soon becomes apparent that Molly and Vivian's lives didn't differ that much from each other despite the seventy-four-year age difference between them.  I think they found a kindred spirit in each other.  Molly having been in and out of foster homes herself has now found a new friend in Vivian and one who understands what she has been through.<br /><br />The Orphan Train was a phenomenal story that affected me deeply.  My heart went out to all the children on the orphan train.  I will most definitely be recommending this wonderful masterpiece to all who'll listen.  Orphan Train gets a huge thumbs up from me!  Thank you Ms. Kline for a most interesting and intriguing story.nd a kindred spirit in each other.  Molly having been in and out of foster homes herself has now found a new friend in Vivian and one who understands what she has been through.<br /><br />The Orphan Train was a phenomenal story that affected me deeply.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the  greatest booms I have ever read an I'm excited to read the next book in the series
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I enjoy reading all his books.  They are all hard to put down.  This one has a twist that will leave you in tears, but a good ending to leave you happy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers especially the new version on Sydney I hope they keep coming out with new versions I also really like how we now have the keys my scores have gotten a lot higher
B002BZOVLG|5.0|The  quality  of the  recording  is  superb, both  in  sound  and image.  I  had  another version  but  this one  is better.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I watched this tv series from beginning to end last year. I loved it so much that I watch the whole season again.
B002Q3B4LI|5.0|Bought this for my niece but I am really enjoying it.  The seller packaged it well, and there's more episodes than I could watch in an entire snowy winter season.  Clean, interesting, and well developed storyline that is an escape for me as well well as a tween-aged girl.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|A funny, touching movie, that also gives a realistic look at mental behavior problems. It's well acted, directed, and the screen play is top notch. It was easily in my top 5 of the year and made an excellent date movie for me and my wife when we saw it a few months back.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|ok this one is a must stay on my kindle. I read and re-read when I need to remember to stay positive!
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|I wouldn't say it was a waste. The story line was actually very interesting. The opening scene is definitely chilling and it grabs your attention right off the bat, making you want to find out what the story is about. But it's pretty bad when I realized 3/4 into the movie that I didn't jump once during any of the scenes that had been set up to make me do so. Also there were times that the picture was so dark it was ridiculous. I get that you want to relay realism, but to the point of not being able to even see? Give me a break.<br /><br />And mature movie goers who have seen the same old flash of black & white sudden appearance of some ghost out of nowhere right next to the main character with the same old requisite blast of loud music: Guess what? It's really old. There are some really interesting ideas out there (e.g., The Pact) that relate stories in innovative ways without all the black and white ghosts and sudden bursts of music. Really, I think it's time to move on.<br /><br />There was nothing that explained why the antagonist decided to do what he did when he did. The last half hour came together a bit too conveniently - the set up for a sequel is abundantly clear. But really, I'd love to know why no one else in the family seemed to have an ounce of logic or seemed to be able to hear anything out of the ordinary in the house.

B00BEZTMWW|4.0|The story line was excellent, supported by great acting. The 3-d showed good depth but a bit more of in your face 3-d wold be nice.  Waiting for the 2nd and 3rd installments.  can't come too soon.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I know at first I thought &#34;who wants a dictionary on their phone&#34;. However, I have used it many times for spelling a word correctly, and at times just to understand the meaing of a word that i wasn't sure of. I also loaded this in my tablet. I love this app!
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|These two actors were a perfect pair for the older couple.  Tommy Lee Jones was believable as a grouchy old man, and Meryl Streep was fantastic as the underappreciated wife looking to revive her marriage.  Worth the money!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Great game and very challenging, i'd like to see when finished the records of the plagues we unleashed (high scores). Then maybe we could get better at what works and unleash worse plagues in the game.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Lots of fun. I love the chat and gifting fellow friends. Also like ability to share items. Just wish not so hard to complete room.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Loved the whole album  - one of my favorite choices to workout with!  Would definitely recommend it to lovers of this genre...

B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is not like any other book in the series. It's filled with danger, romance, mystery, action, and suspension. You will never want to put this book down!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amy, a wife, disappears under seemingly violent circumstances from her Midwest home. Husband Nick grieves awkwardly until he discovers the truth. Then the game is on ... To defend himself and expose the truth about her.<br /><br />In this tightly woven tale of twisted love and revenge, Gillian Flynn keeps the reader enthralled. Just when I thought I'd figured something out, just as Nick did, a new wrinkle would develop to make me doubt myself. Then pages later my original suspicion would be confirmed.<br /><br />Flynn takes the reader on a roller coaster ride with Nick. Told alternately by Nick and Amy (through her diary), the story leaves the reader at times frustrated, disgusted, triumphant, defeated, amazed, and suspicious.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game, I'm addicted to it. I have had a couple technical difficulties with it, but I still love it.
B006C1DH92|2.0|It is a cute game but not long enough.  It is OK for kids but adults will get bored quickly.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|After about my 3rd time playing, I was done.  It gets harder as you pass levels but it's the same thing over and over again.  Boring.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I have a 4 year old and she loves this movie.  I do have to skip over the shooting scenes because of her age but the rest is really cute.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|intense, but not overly violent.  Since it is historical, those of us who lived through this situation have special interest in this episode of our lives.  Great performances by all.  Highly reccommend!
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|It was good but it felt like more could have been done.  I can't pinpoint what I think should be changed or elaborated on but it left me a little wanting.
B007HO392S|5.0|Who doesn't love Carrie Underwood??  I remember watching her back on her season of American Idol...Carrie rocks!  LOVE LOVE LOVE HER!
B009VB7P6G|4.0|I was worried about what this movie was going to be like.  It's the fourth in the series and that dosen't usualy bode well but the graphics were great and the stroyline was really cute.  Definetly can watch this multiple times with my 3 year old.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I hope that your planing on giving more credits to play more games.this is the most interesting bingo game out th there. but there's always room for improvements. I love this bingo game but like most people who play bingo we love to play longer and would like some more credits for our bingos.so please try to improve this game.  keep up the good jobs your team is doing. have more seasons games.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I don't usualy like subtitled movies but this one is really good.  I forget I'm reading about 15 minutes in.  We looked up the info. on it on the internet later and it looks like they're going to re-make it in english which I think is disapointing-it stands on it's own, it dosen't need to be remade.
B005S9EJ46|1.0|I just purchased this movie and ran it because of the many positive reviews it has received here. What must these reviewers be thinking? They must know little about good film making!  I was very disappointed by the actors and everything else about this movie.  The fine actors appearing were completely wasted.  The young, silly, India male star was goofy and did a poor job running around all over the place, like a drunk neurotic.  The direction was limpid.  No plot was clear. There was little or nothing shown of Jaipur, India where the movie was shot. The many stars appeared tired and surprised to find themselves in this turkey! There was no Art Direction.  None of the hotel's guests were shown in their bedrooms, but always sitting in the rundown, weed-strewn courtyard.  Having to travel to India and appear to be living in a run-down old and trashy hotel must have surprised and shocked the skilled and excellent actors as much as the picture did for me.  What was the meaning of these old folks going to India in the first place?  Judy Dench was shown getting a job in a factory in Jaipur because she needed money!  An American can't just travel to India and get a job, thus displacing a citizen of India where there is vast unemployment.  The idea of making this absurd and boring movie was a disaster, and this film will not make money, even though it was made for peanuts in India.
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|I personally think this show has lost it's direction. However, I am reluctant to say too much against the show, after all it continues to have a solid fan base, good ratings and has made through eight seasons. I would like to see the show get back on track with a focus of decoding the tablets ect. If this happens Iwould give the show 5 stars. I have enjoyed the show over the past seven years.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|The music was really good in this movie.  We loved &#34;Fat Amy&#34;, too.  The story line was so-so, but overall, very entertaining movie.
B0042KA5EK|5.0|I was hooked on this show from the start. I think the cast worked together from the start. It has great action and suspence. Nikita has a different spin than other shows of this type, which intreges me. I like shows that are different from the main stream and sets itself apart. This is definitely that type of show.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great visuals and challenging puzzles.  Nice audio and tactile response.  Can't wait for more rooms. Loading time a bit long, but we'll worth the wait
B0097PW7H8|3.0|I like that this allows me to extend the life of my battery in several ways, but I wish I could see the exact percentage of remaining power on the home page.
1451695195|4.0|I liked the book just thought there would be more about his journey into the unknown, not about his whole life prior to his illness.<br />.
B000FA675C|5.0|I bought the book some years ago, and really enjoyed the book.  Since I have begun culling out my paperbacks/hardbacks, I decided this was one book I wanted to keep digitally.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book is better than the movie!  Definitely read the book before going to see the movie. I had to explain some parts of the movie to my husband because it doesn't cover the whole story well.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like this app OK, but it isn't very user-friendly.  For instance, I added a NY location instead of a NC location, and there doesn't seem to be any way to remove the NY INCORRECT location.
0345803485|5.0|I was NEVER a reader until I got my hands on this book.  It will always be special to me for that reason.  I was completely obsessed with anything and everything Christian Grey for quite awhile.  I loved this book.  It is hot!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|IT TOOK A LITTLE TIME TO APPRECIATE THE STRANGENESS OF THIS UNLIKELY STORY, BUT ONCE INTO IT,IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP READING TILL THE LAST PAGE.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was a very emotional read but I loved, loved, loved every single minute of this book.  I love Will and Lake!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Loved this game. Played it two times, each time the hidden objects were different, which made it more interesting. Be warned you do have to pay after playing for awhile.<br /><br />Conlyn
B0015DYIH2|3.0|Am glad this whole series is over.  I'm over it.  Books were good reads and movies were enjoyable but enough is enough.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|He has such a smooth and beautiful voice.  I could listen to him forever.  Very romantic and relaxing.  Love it.
0345803493|5.0|Truly, Amazing.  I loved the first book so much but this book blew me away.  I loved seeing the softer side to Christian.  Ana brings out the best in him.  I am utterly and completely in lust!
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|Again like all the games that I have downloaded that look fun from the company Playrix, this was another easy one, I am glad I got it for free.
0425263908|5.0|What can I say I love Gideon.  This was a powerful story with some dark moments.  At times I was confused about why he was being the way he was.  By the end of the story you have your answers (well, sort of).  I am anxiously awaiting the next book to fill in the blanks.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love all sorts of Bingo games, however this is my all time favorite one for I can play with my friends no matter where I am at.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't believe I never reviewed this book.  Read it the day it came out!  What a wonderful story!!!!  Holder and Sky are a perfect pair.  I am so looking forward to the next book from his point of view.  I love anything and everything Colleen Hoover.
B00ANW33CM|2.0|I like mahjong games, however I will not download any to my Kindle fire, for there have been many, and not any of them appear big enough, hurts the eyes to play.
0345803507|5.0|I am obsessed with this series.  I have all the girls reading it at my work and we talk about it during luch.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|Went around the world like 4 times in 2 day's game was way to easy, was not worth the money I paid for it, I like a challenge to my puzzle games.
B00000JG41|5.0|The self-titled first album sounds like a teenager. Hyper active, lots of funk mixed with metal, and purile lyrics. Mike Patton still sang with the same nasal voice he had on Faith No More's \\"the real thing\\".<br /><br />The second, \\"Disco Volante\\", was completely different. The hyper active teenager had turned into a art farty snob, a film buff, but only of obscure films. Disco Volante was at times deliberately off-putting. As if the teenager from the first album found his music attracted way more beer drinking knuckle heads to his shows than he had intended. \\"Disco Volante\\" played around with moments of silence and pure noise, of the band messing around, even the opening song sounded like it was meant to scare off listeners. It was a bit of an endurance test. \\"Special music for special people...jocks stay out\\", that sort of thing.<br /><br />On \\"California\\", the obscurity buff has outgrown that phase and decided that there was plenty of inspiration to be had from pop and world music.<br />In that sense it is a more accessible album, but instead of standard pop they give us something much more ambitious. California is well-crafted, ambitious, humorous, and highly entertaining. A psychedelic Cyber-Vaudeville musical extravaganza of the highest order.<br /><br />\\"Sweet charity\\" is a song that Sammy Davis Jr. might have sung. \\"None of them knew they were robots\\" combines jazz and metal and ends up sounding like a fast paced Hollywood musical somehow. \\"Retrovertigo\\" is a the most standard pop song on the album, but the lyrics sound like a postmodernist reflection on modern society taken from a Science Fiction novel. \\"Air conditioned nightmare\\" is clearly a Beach Boys soundtrack to a Hitchcock film. \\"Ars Moriendi\\" is a Rumanian gypsy wedding. Things turn into Parliament Funkadelic meets Stevie Wonder singing about Gilgamesh on the next song, dive into an ethereal composition \\"Holy Filament\\", which sounds like Frank Zappa singing from a cloud. It is followed by a bee-bopsong and the album culminates into \\"goodbye Sober Day\\", the best possible song to end such a wide ranging ambitious album.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Just was really seeing what it was about and to give it a try. nothing bad about it just didn't please me with a app game.
1452115567|5.0|Maddie on Things is an amazing book. You get so many photographs, all of which are lighthearted and will brighten your day. It was a wonderful joy to look through and well worth your money.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I've been wanting to read this for some time now. I hope to pick it up soon so i can let thoes kids who like Twilight know what a real vampire shoule look like! ;P
B007W7P5L8|5.0|The case really works for me, and purple is my favorite color.  Glad they had it. Just need to figure out how to work out the stand.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Not only Cleese at his best,but more consistently funny ,to watch over and over, than anything Monty Python did. And I love the &#34;trilogy &#34; as much as the next guy..Finally got it on DVD.Pretty great.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can hardly wait for the next book.  I finished this in a day.  I am sure the next book will be as good.  Everyone I have recomended this too loves it.  Can't put it down
6304779259|2.0|the disc is stuck on audio only, only the music plays, i worked with the on/of audio button and it still does not work. also i bought this edition because it said alternate ending included. When the disc arrived i discovered the alternate ending was a video stills and reading what happened. There was a version where the alternate ending was the actual film footage of Audrey II eating the girl and guy and finally the whole city. i dont know if that version still exist out there but thats the alternate ending i have been looking for.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I was looking for books that I could use in a class and this book fits the bill. It has a lot of material to contemplate for my clients.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I enjoyed Argo very much. It had tension and I'm old enough to know how it ended. Then there was that whole thing about the Oscar's snubbing Ben Affleck AND I had seen Argo before the gala event... I had no problem with their choice. I saw Life of Pi about two weeks later. Boom. The Oscar people suck, again. A great story. Great cinematography. CGI and puppetry that looks so real(don't waste time and attention looking for it now that I mentioned it or you could end up a pretentious schmuck who votes on future Oscar winners.<br /> And now I saw it in Blu Ray. Boom. Again. Buy this; rent this; see this movie.
1439152802|5.0|This was such a good tale, written superbly with such lush descriptions. I love the intelligence in her novels, the juicy details and little gems she clues the reader with throughout the story. My advice: get this book on a weekend when you've got the house to yourself and can truly indulge!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I love Blake's music and I believe this is one of his best, Would recommend this to anyone who likes Blake or country music.
1439152799|5.0|Kate Morton does it again with this novel. Beautifully written, she creates a good mystery that will keep you up for hours.<br />I adore her work, one of my favorite authors. Worth every penny!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It was just like any other Nicholas Sparks books, amazing and kept you in suspense. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if they love Nicholas Sparks books :)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I bought Wool, Omnibus Edition on a recommendation from the \\"people who looked at\\" option after buying something else. It was $6, so why not? Then, 6 months later I got around to actually reading it. I started on a plane ride to the east coast and then didn't want to see anything in New York (first visit) because all I could do was think about what came next!<br /><br />The story was a unique approach to apocalyptic fiction, with only slight reflections of that horrible \\"The Island\\" movie, but mostly it was just a great read. Howey does a great job of making the characters come to life, and I'm happy I spent time with them.<br /><br />Buy it, set aside 2 days of solid reading time, and do it!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is the first &#34;automatic&#34; watch I have owned. It remains to be seen if it will keep time as well as a battery watch but otherwise it was easy to set and I like the canvas strap. I have owned several work or everyday watches with velcro straps and the velcro wears out way before the watch and they are nearly impossible to replace so I hope this is a more permanent solution.
B00BDSRISA|3.0|I am giving this CD a 3 star rating because it is a 4 star record...Yeah that makes zero sense however old Gilby gave it 5 stars and a nice 0 star for Obama so I am here to even the score.  I really enjoy this band...The CD drags in a place or two but they have shown growth and more musical maturity since their debut cd.  Amazon...Please block Gilby III from writing reviews.  He is not serious and only posting reviews for attention...don't let this valuable service become a mockery.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|great movie really funny thanks a lot, great quality and kept me all the time interested on the movie. l
B000FC10MU|4.0|Definitely different from anything I've read before. I mean, the gods walking amongst us isn't new, but all of the details were. Also, the mixing of the various legends and the conceptualization of the gods was quite interesting.  I can only imagine the research such a book required.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|I've always been a fan of Michael Crichton and the plot/concept intrigued me. However I was really shocked and disappointed at how badly written, verbose, banal and boring this book was. I could not bond with any of the characters and thus could not care about what happens to them.  Avoid, especially if you're a Crichton fan because this book is based on Crichtons concept but atually written by Richard Preston.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|installed and configured six months ago on my hd 8'9'  no problems others have had.  i did go through the setup.  great app, use it everyday.
0394806220|5.0|Seriously, how could you go wrong with classic Seuss?  Unlike the butchered board books, the hardcovers are just like I remember them.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|The movie is beautifully crafted.  The actors across the cast are excellent, the direction and cinematography are superb.  I was totally engrossed in the story.  What some would consider a difficult or controversial subject is handled sensitively.  Overall, a beautiful film that touched my heart.
0394800389|5.0|Seriously, how could you go wrong with classic Seuss?  Unlike the butchered board books, the hardcovers are just like I remember them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I chose it after reading the series from a coworker. I totally enjoyed it. I could put myself in the book like it was all happening to me. That's what makes a great book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway suffers! It's tremendously challenging and highly interesting. I love the kid who is the primary runner he adds an individual feel to the game. Many avenues of the game have yet to be explored by me but I do enjoybit nonetheless. My only question for the game's developers is will there ever be an ending? I feel that as long as the kid doesn't get hit, he will run forever! Lol.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It's a really good game. Best temple run game yet.<br />But it's glitchy. I accidently pressed make a review when I meant to press later.<br />It wont let me play it anymore. Hopefully after I post this, it will let me.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Good game play and graphics. Very fun game.<br /><br />Hope to see more games like this. Hard to believe this was free
B0012FHGCW|4.0|Very good movie But I don't care for sad endings of course  it was based on a true story I guess
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Their was a lot of different areas to go to,  and it was fun &amp; interesting.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|For the price you get a strong watch, I personally liked its design, and if you loose it, not big deal
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Alt-J is really a game changer in music. Sweet melodies and emotive sounds, so glad I stumbled upon this band. Please do the same and I promise you will loooooove them!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This is the real facebook as you see it online on your computer. The only one to use on the kindle as far as I am concerned.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The charger I got with the original unit went kittywampus and this with the PowerFast unit was a good (and free) replacement.
B008J05EL8|5.0|I got office pro but couldn't open my documents without getting this app This should have been part of the pro package to begin with, at no extra cost.
0783225881|5.0|I recommend this movie for family viewing, especially for youth interested in the history of baseball. I purchased it for my grand child who asked a lot of questions about &#34;Shoeless&#34; Joe Jackson. Adults and children enjoy this movie and is a keeper for my video library.
B00002ZMNV|2.0|probably a good product, but it will not play in any of my machines.  i suppose it can only be used in whatever country it was produced in.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Amazing how the movie came from this book. They aren't nearly alike, but doesn't matter. This book is adorable and I'm glad I read it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|A terrific tool to help us keep track of all the great ideas we would like to try. A way to hold on to the instructions on how to.....In essence a scrapbook of everything we want to do, try, have, or<br />remember!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Idea for family gatherings and memorable events.  Something for everyone to have and to hold....purchase it and you will love it too.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Some very interesting concepts here that will ring true for every parent who's had kids in organized sports.  A lot of practical application to work life as well.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Robots Fight. That's about it. There is a fairly good plot but, this is really secondary to the kaboom, kapow, boom, pow special effects. If you like that stuff add a star if not.....then 3 stars is about right.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|It's an interesting twist on the musical. After the recent release of Les Mis, nothing else can compare in adaptation of musical to the silver screen.
B00AIJP9BS|4.0|this game is pretty fun if i just stay in the tutorial, never try to calibrate (it hangs on the &quot;wait&quot; screen) and don't expect it to be anything like foosball. it's really more like weeble-wobble soccer. the good thing is that the AI doesn't seem to have any more control over its players than i do over mine. it took me a while to get used to the controls but now i think they're not so bad. the music is annoying but you can turn it down or off in the settings. my main complaint is that it's too easy to kick the ball out of bounds and as another reviewer said, it would be nice if there was a roof or something for the ball to ricochet off of. there were many times when i thought i should have gotten a goal but i didn't because the ball was too high &amp; it just flew over the goal.<br /><br />i wouldn't be too happy if i'd payed for this game &amp; was actually expecting foosball. but as the FAOTD i think it's not too bad, at least i can enjoy playing with it for a little while before i get bored and delete it. i will probably be deleting it later today.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game to play.  Easy for first time player. Graphics are fantastic. Now I can play with my children.
B000008LNS|5.0|Toto, to me immortal for all the nice memories and remembrances they awake in me since childhood, mostly now gone all of them!<br />This album is a homage to Jeff Porcaro who died really young in 1992. God be with him!<br />I like almost all Toto's songs!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater. I had seen the stage play and was pleased at how well they had adapted it for the movie. The cast was outstanding without a weak link. Some of the best stage music in decades. I am pleased to have the BluRay so I can watch it anytime.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|Not as good as the previous two in theClifton  Chrincles, a bit of a boys own type of story now. Not very exciting.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Excellent book. Another day in the life of defenders of the United States. If only it was real. Everyone knows of the corruption, but as usual we throw money at it and the policy makers think they have done a good job. Spending other people's money is never a problem for anyone.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|Felt this movie was Over Sold by the media and pushed on the viewers to be much better then it was. We were also misled to be under the impression this movie was going to deal with mature, dark, topics that usually remained 'in the closet' until now- Mental Illness! We found it just brushed up against mental illness over a few short conversations or arguments within the film. I don't feel it really dealt with it in a mature manner like those who deal with it on a daily basis do with a real, honest understanding. I was hoping for a more in-depth realistic look into the life.  Very disappointed as we were with Jennifer Lawrence acting abilities, I don't understand how she could be considered for anything from what was seen in that movie- maybe they haven't seen her in anything else realizing that is how she always behaves, speaks and just is.... She didn't seem any different to me of a character to me then she did in her previous movie. Her attitude is horrible as well, very disappointing for a young woman in Hollywood today.<br />Don't waste your money, if you are curious they way you are when you see a car accident- wait until it is out for the free rentals. You will be sorry if you spend full price and walk out realizing you were just duped.<br />It is the case of the Emperor is wearing no clothes, but so many people have been telling you it's beautiful you think it must be you are afraid to see something else. Don't be afraid to say what you really feel. I am not- it stinks. The Guys do a nice job in the movie, they have stronger acting abilities and it shows.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a good app. I need to wear bi-focals and thid app is good for my eyes because the numbers are larger.
B001OY5X2Q|5.0|Coming of age in the 80's and heavily in the post-punk scene several bands were staple: Joy Division/New Order, The Cure, Echo & the Bunnymen, and Siouxsie and the Banshees.  (All due respect to other bands we all loved; I for one was a huge Bauhaus/Love and Rockets fan.)  I'm still in contact with a lot of my friends from then, and many still love that music, and while some of us let go of The Cure or the Bunnymen we nearly all still love Siouxsie and have come to appreciate how good this album really is.  I remember when it came out some Siouxsie fans from way back were a little dubious of the more pop influence they saw in this album.  Frankly, I never did and maintain this is one of the best Siouxsie albums.  It is certainly one of the most listenable from beginning to end, and never deviates from a mood of reflection and wonder.  While there are Siouxsie songs on other albums I list as favorites, I can finally say after all these years this is my favorite whole album.
B007G8MMP0|4.0|I like it, Mel Gibson always delivers a great performance.. I recommend it to anyone loves a high caliber movie..
B00112HZEA|5.0|I've purchased many of these Schleich animals for my granddaughter who loves farm animals. They're all great.  Exactly what I expected. Looking forward to expanding her collection over time.
B002VWNICW|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again.. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves to be in love.
B005VOXOBC|5.0|I've purchased many of these Schleich animals for my granddaughter who loves farm animals. They're all great.  Exactly what I expected. Looking forward to expanding her collection over time.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This has been a great investment. I am able to check battery level, available time left for various activities, and be verbally notified of remaining battery life. The visual aspect of checking battery life appeals to the left-handed me. It is simple to customize as well.
B002SRQ214|5.0|this processor has been nothing but good to me, it runs fast, and introduces a smooth code processing. plays games very well. good with watching movies, and decent with transcoding video, not that that's what it was intended for but it gets the job done. about a month in a half later i removed the stock cooler, re-greased it and strapped a cooler master liquid cooling system down. stays cool even with slight overclocking. I reccomend this cpu to anyone that wants to build a more dependable longer lasting pc.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Gives a great feeling of what it must be like for prisoners and and an understanding of the adjustments escapees go through
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|This was a great idea I enjoyed very much but it was so harsh it was difficult to handle sometimes but worth it when revenge was awarded...more than once.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The sound is good when the headphones work.  They cut in and out a lot.  The USB transmitter keeps rebooting and there is a lot of static due to poor wireless signal from the transmitter.  Really sucks when you are chatting with friends in game and you don't hear what they say.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Awesome book with an amazing plot. A little boring in the end, but it does get better. Recommended to anyone!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|nice graphics. unusual gameplay. it is a LOT of fun eating human swimmers. try it. you might like it. controls could be better. though.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Purchased this with not such great expectations however the ART-3350 proved me wrong<br />I used this on a Ferrari F 355 to monitor the exhaust sound.<br />We mounted it on the rear bumper where the plate goes and covered it with some foam to reduce wind noise<br />Mated it to a Cannon vixia HF HD cam mounted on the dash.<br />The video and sound surpassed our expectations<br /><br />Ferrari F 355 on the track using this mic set at 60% input<br /><br />[...]
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Based on the reviews, I wasn't expecting much.  Watched the movie with my wife and another couple.  Maybe it's just me (us), but we all laughed hysterically through most of the movie.  While it was somewhat scattered, it was funny and entertaining.
B007SGM084|4.0|I enjoyed the relationship part of the books. I think we can all picture ourselves<br />as their characters, from previous relationships.
1451695195|4.0|This man has perhaps the best background ever to describe what it means when your brain is &#34;turned off.&#34;  That he experienced what he did was fascinating, but I have two criticisms:<br />1. he keeps referring to the incredible conversations he had with God, but doesn't say what transpired in them, even though he claims he remembers it<br />2. the technique of jumping back and forth between that experience and what happened in his life, past and present, is distracting.  I finally just marked the chapters as to what they contained, and read them straight through in that format, which was much easier to follow.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great story and the movie follows the first book so well that I want even disappointed when I read it! The author did an amazing job of wrapping it all up in the end as well. It was well worth the read!
B0000C9JFO|4.0|This is a very cute story about a group of international students who share an apt. in Barcelona for a year while studying there.  It reflects the fun and the troubles, the loyalties and the aggravations, and a certain amount of the sights of Barcelona (although I'd have liked more).
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I loved this game. Not too hard, but not to easy, just right.  Would recommend this to anyone who likes adventure games.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|A perfect film.  As the New Yorker said, &#34;It's called a gay cowboy movie, but it isn't about gays, and it isn't about cowboys.  It's about Love Under Siege.&#34;
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Great way to find out where it all began. You will end up wanting to watch more and more, to see where the characters are going and how they are developing
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fantastic game. Great graphics, and very fun. I love horses and I enjoy this game very much fun. I love it a lot.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|Some friend recommended me this movie... So I buyed this cause it was at a really nice price... It's a good movie, entertaining to see..
B002QYSZBO|5.0|I cannot fathom words to describe how brilliant this movie is. I've seen it about 10-20 times and it still cracks me up. Val Kilmer and RDJ have perfect on screen chemistry which makes their wonderfully witty banter even more amazing.<br /><br />This movie also taught me the correct usage of the word 'badly'.
B009JBZH54|5.0|When I saw this trilogy, I buyed it because I really like Batman. But once I received it, I was surprissed of how nicely is this box assembled. The box cover has some smooth texture, and the art book it's pretty nice...
B00932A2MC|5.0|LOVE THIS ONE, IN BLUERAY IT REALLY SOUNDS AND LOOKS SO GOOD, U WONT BELIEVE WHAT U CAN SEE IN THIS MOVIE ON BLUERAY, GOOD PLOT, GOOD TWIST.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I didn't make it to watch this movie on theatres, so I got this, and I really enjoyed watching it...

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Read the books! LOVE them! Saw the movie, not as good as the book. Hope the next movie is better!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|The product came a bit late but I wasn't really in much of a hurry to begin with. Great and reliable compound.
B004NELBPC|1.0|Seeing the home page, I was excited for all of ten seconds. Then I actually tried to use it... nothing loads, I can't set up my favorites anymore, it's trying too hard to look cool rather than be accessible. This was my favorite app, please fix your glitches or just go back to the way it was!
B0072GPQNG|3.0|A typical Steven Spielberg type of movie.  It's definitely a tear jerker for those who love horses or animals put into the situation of having to survive wars that &#34;man&#34; has put them into.  A &#34;National Velvet&#34; kind of Hollywood take on what it must have been like during those stupid brutal years for all things living.  Still not a bad way to while away a few hours if you love horses.
030758836X|4.0|This book is so captivating! Just when you think you know where the author is going, she takes a sharp turn and adds a twist. I would not have predicted this ending.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I would have given this game five stars but when I bought the extended levels the day after I bought them the game said that I bought the levels but wouldn't let me play them.
B004XISI4A|4.0|Not a bad read but not up to his first couple of books in the series. I'm still interested in finding out what happens, but the story is dragging on with too many new characters entering the ploy.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I struggled to finish. Found that there was too many characters . Had to write down the pairings and who was friendly with who. A complicated story.

B006TF6WAM|5.0|A wonderful read.  Depicting  a journey through life, finding troubles and kindnesses on the way until you reach your dreams. And finding dreams are not always what  you expect.
B0006TLA22|3.0|They seem to be similar to exedrin. I find that they work but kind of tear up my stomach. Drink with milk or take with food. Wife notes that they do not take her headaches away. Will try a different product next time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I'm a 25- year old, heterosexual male. I read this book PURELY out of curiosity. Admittedly, this was my FIRST romance novel (and NOVEL for that matter).  I have to say: while reading, as with all other books that I read, I imagine that it's a movie, and  I'm able to better comprehend the story. I LOOK FORWARD to that actually coming to pass.
B008P9M614|5.0|I never watched House during its 8-year run on NBC.  The first 3 seasons were extraordinarily done; no cute story formula as in the subsequent season.  Season 5 definitely had its moment, but seasons 4 and 6 through 8 are really more of a soap opera.  Still, I have to admit that it is a gigantic accomplishment for any show to keep growing and expanding its scope well enough to remain entertaining to today's fickle network TV audiences.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|It doesn't put the finest edge on a blade but the combination of the carbide sharper and the ceramic sharpener are great. Having the diamond sharpener for serrations is fantastic. You can pretty much sharpen any knife you would typically carry. It's light, portable, effective. Why would you not have one?
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|This is one of my all-time favourite movies.  Tells the truth about so many things.  I always watch and listen to the special features and the commentary during the movie.  Antoine Fuqua really shared a lot and I appreciate the information SO<br />much.  Great movie.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|0 yes this also was for my other grandaugther and the screaming  , so happy , thought she was going to beat my floor in or hurt her self when seen it happy
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|By the time we reach Season Three, we (the viewers) have become quite comfortable with the characters of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; and come to expect there will be some sort of resolution to all of the troubles that have been building - but oh what resolutions writer Julian Fellowes has given us - deaths, destruction, ruin, marriages, romances, fights.... and that's in the first five minutes! (just kidding) I love this show and look forward to Season Four... but with Fellowes leaving, I wonder how long it will go on.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|This movie was cute, but not very funny. I would recommend it for small children, but not enough adult humor for adults to enjoy.
B008602KQI|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence could read the phone book and I would be fascinated. However, the plot of the Hunger Games is rather weak. Predicting the future has always been a stumbling block for most science fiction writers. We've seen plenty of versions regarding how terrible the future will be... going all the way back to Huxley and Wells. This one divides the country (I presume it is America) into the very wealthy and the very poor, with one poor person given the chance to survive a publically broadcast games that pit children against one another until only one is left standing. This is about as likely as never happening. The premise is so weak as to make the rest of the movie a joke. Supporting performances are also weak. The film relies almost entirely on special effects and the performances of Lawrence and veteran Donald Sutherland. While I love science fiction, I found the end did not justify the means. The plot is weak throughout and solution is open ended, hence Hunger Games, two - will Jennifer end up with her true boyfriend; will she have to volunteer for the games again (she'd have to survive because I believe there is a book three!!!!). Unfortunately, it did well at the box office and Hollywood loves a winner so there will be more coming... but I will not be watching.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game has been very entertaining and enjoyable. I have played it many times and have had a great time with each game. I highly recommend this book to all players who are looking for something that challenges them...<br /><br />Gaston Sanders, Author
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As with Season One, Season Two of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; gives us more of what we've come to expect - great believable plots, great acting, incredible sets, and the merry mix of two worlds - those of the servants and the upper class - each with their own set of foibles and goals.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|... it is still a great read! And the next one gets much better. If you've come this far, don't quit now...
B00723NWJE|5.0|I've never bought a Norah Jones cd I didn't like.  I read some reviews somewhere about people being disturbed by her song Miriam.  I think artists should explore what they want, and if people don't like it they don't have to buy it.  I like this cd, and the song Miriam is creepy but also interesting.  I mean, seriously how many stupid life time movies are about that very thing......woman killing the mistress.........?<br /><br />I just love her voice and her lyrics are always interesting.  Good cd.

030758836X|1.0|I couldn't finish this book.  It was too cruel, too mean-spirited, and there wasn't a character in it who was even remotely likeable.  I love reading, and I felt I would be better served using the time it would take me to finish this book by reading a better one.
1452115567|5.0|I follow Theron (@thiswildidea) on Instagram and was so excited when his book about Maddie was available on Amazon!  This is such a fun and inspirational book about changing your life and changing the lives of others with the help of one of the sweetest dogs ever!  I highly recommend this book and will keep it on my coffee table for a long time.  This is a gem of a book!

0307352153|5.0|\\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking\\" is most engaging to read.  It is beautifully written and well researched.  It offers new perspective into introversion compared to the extrovert norm often encouraged by society. The outcome: encouragement for those who function as introverts.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|What a shame. Disney marketing masterfully turns an easy sale into no sale. Lack of included 2D makes this package a non starter.<br /><br />Also, this is a product review, not a movie review. The product available here for pre-order has a show stopping (literally) packaging problem. If you love the movie hidden behind the packaging curtain, then rate it highly on a movie review site, but focus here on whether people should spend their money on the shrink wrapped item at the top of the page.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This seemlessly links your amazon music. It allows you to download or play songs from the cloud. I have never had any issues with performance.
0756404746|3.0|I'll keep it short.  Obviously a lot of people really liked this book, and there is a lot to like since it is a great story.  But be warned, it moves very slowly and at the end nothing will be revealed.  I mean nothing. Throughout the book he spends pages and pages building and then fizzles out with a little action and no resolution.  Then repeat.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have uninstalled this application. I prefer the web interface to the app. The app itself is ok, I just do not need it on my phone.

B006GWO5NE|4.0|as advertised the cable is fine, well made no complaints.  Since it came from Amazon it must be good, it works fine.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Boz is one of the artists in my music collection that I HAVE TO own everything he puts out.  I enjoyed my initial listen to this disc, and especially his versions of previously popular songs.  Boz still has a great voice, and Steve Jordan's impact on the album is palpable.  Will give it more time before I can pronounce final judgement...
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This is a terrific film pure and simple.  So its derivative, so what?  Its well done, got some good thoughts and highly entertaining.  Cruise is really good and the film is beautiful in its way to look at.  Morgan Freeman does his usually great job and everyone else is fine, fine.  What's not to like?  Sometime the regular media critics are too knowing for their own good. (I understand they've got their job to do but they got a little carried away on this one).  If you like SF especially don't miss this.
B00009RAJH|5.0|A lot of folks say &#34;Rumours&#34; is the peak of latter day Fleetwood Mac, but I say that from the kick off of &#34; Monday Morning&#34;, that this record simply never stops.  All the unreleased stuff is cool, too, but what I'll be listening to the rest of my life is the remastered original disc.  Can't be any better.

B001V7YWTQ|4.0|I enjoyed this recording, given that it was essentially a Blind Faith reunion.  Both of these artists reside in my personal pantheon of heroes, and I own everything they ever put out.  All that being said, I wll also say that while I like it, I'm not sure that any of the versions on this record surpass or equal their previously issued studio versions.  A gotta have record for the hard core fan, not sure about how essential it is for anyone else...
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Shipped promptly and at a decent price. Wonderful movie with surprise ending. Scenery awesome. Recommend this movie to anyone who liked Lord of the rings.
B008HK3SFO|5.0|I already new I would rather have a pouch-type case than a hard case or one that you can transform to stand-up. I wanted something that closed completed so the edges of my kindle would not be exposed to my crazy &#34;grab-it-and-run&#34; lifestyle. I enjoy using my kindle alone without fiddling with a case. I also like that I can just throw it in my purse, tote bag or whatever (its not bulky) and it is completely closed off, padded and protected. This case was a perfect fit for me!

B00C2MM35O|4.0|First off Arrow's missions and the flash backs to the Island are fantastic.  The family drama is good too.  The main story line is engaging and exciting.

B00AIJP9BS|4.0|Worked ok on galaxy tab 2 10.1 tablet<br />Not really a game I would use very often.<br />Found it interesting having each piece individually controllable instead of a line at a time. Full 360 direction control.
B004XUDAH8|2.0|I really can't tell one track from another. There are lots of strings, swooping and melodious, but it goes on and on. Very few vocals, and certainly nothing with any punch. Instead of a collection of different styles and emotions, every track blends into every other track, without much to distinguish them.<br /><br />I bought this collection without trying the samples, just because it was Moby. That was a mistake.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|I have long been a fan of this author and his writings. Several of his books touched my spirit deeply, a few not so much. This newest work however. Is a blessing. I highly recommended it to a few people that I knew needed to hear the message of love. I recommend it to you.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I admit to having mislaid the virtue of patience if ever it were in my grasp.  I watched the first season, and I had to read it all -- immediately -- not realizing that ALL are not yet written.  Now I fret about the health and well-being of the author with an intensity that rivals the loathsome Littlefinger's machinations and the Game of thrones itself.  What a gripping series made from a compelling page turner!  I love the pacing of both the video and the print versions.  Intensity mixed with exquisitely serene moments where the characters step out of time and action to appreciate their enchanting world.

B009YX02T8|5.0|I love soundtracks because they are usually the easiest way to own various artists on one CD.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|After `The Dark Knight' became an international sensation and nearly secured a Best Picture Oscar nomination, there was a lot of pressure heaped on Christopher Nolan's shoulders to create something substantial as his follow up.  `The Dark Knight Rises' was met, right out the gate, with a lot of buzz and hype and extremely high expectations.  How in the world was Nolan going to compete with himself?  When you have a film that not only became a boxoffice smash hit but also managed to layer topical themes, contain breaking edge visuals and deliver one of the most iconic comic book performances of all time it is hard to do anything but disappoint.<br /><br />Nolan doesn't; at least not entirely.<br /><br />Sure, if you want into this expecting to compare this frame for frame with `The Dark Knight', you're going to be let down.  The second installment in this beloved trilogy is by far the best of the best, but that isn't to say that `The Dark Knight Rises' doesn't rise to the occasion (pun intended) and deliver something breathtaking in the process.  Making the most of its lengthy running time, we are treated to a visceral feast (the lighting, the effects, the skin tight catsuit) that may regurgitate a few tricks (if I were a citizen of Gotham City, I'd move FAR AWAY) but that ultimately stands up as a monumental feat in the comic book movie world.<br /><br />Bale, Caine, Gordon-Levitt, Oldman, Hardy and Hathaway are all fantastic in their roles, with Hathaway being sensationally layered and delivering a very different performance than her Oscar winning role in `Les Miserables' (both were worthy of the gold, making her one of the most deserved Oscar winners in recent history).  Nolan works wonders behind the camera, setting up his epic journey in a way that spellbinds the audience.  He is a master of his craft, a true showman who understands who to develop action scenes with class.  From start to finish, this is a bold and daring film that allows the legend of Batman to live on in a way that feels fresh, unique and visionary.  There are few superhero films that can compete with the amount of humanity that Nolan puts into every frame.<br /><br />Sure, `The Avengers' was fun, but it can't hold a candle to Nolan's juggernaut.live on in a way that feels fresh, unique and visionary.

B008220C38|5.0|Count me in the Joe Wright fan club.  I've been a pretty diehard fan of his since seeing `Pride and Prejudice' and his knack for elaborate showmanship continues to elate me.  He's like a more refined Baz Luhrmann and I love him for that.  After failing to ignite audiences with `The Soloist' (the only Wright film I haven't seen) and then trying his hand at the popular `teen kills adults' genre, Wright came back home to his roots with `Anna Karenina'.  This also reteamed him with his muse, Keira Knightley, giving them both something intriguing to sink their claws into.<br /><br />`Anna Karenina' was a project met with immediate skepticism.  Tolstoy is not an easy author to adapt, and when taking on such a big and beloved literary piece the critics are already sharpening their knives to dig in and destroy.  For those who love the original text, I can see where the complaints carry merit.  I have not read Tolstoy's gargantuan novel, but I hear that the romantic subplot and Karenina's eventual demise is not the supreme focus of the book and so the constant focus on her romantic plight is a sore spot for those devoted to Tolstoy's classic.<br /><br />For those of us who have not read the book and are basing their opinions on the craftsmanship of the film itself; this is VERY rewarding.<br /><br />Yes, `Anna Karenina' is a sweeping epic that has so much character and style one cannot simply dismiss it.  In the hands of visionary Wright, we are taking on a very visceral journey that stays with the viewer long after the credits have finished rolling.  The story takes place in 19th century Russia where aristocrat Anna, married to the older Karenin, suffers greatly after entering into an affair with the dashing Count Vronsky.  Vronsky is the eye of young Kitty's heart, but he is smitten with the illusive Anna and makes it a point to seek out her affections.  In the meantime, Anna is trying to help mend the marriage of her adulterous brother and his wife, Dolly.  When word of their affair gets out, shame is placed all over Anna and Karenin, and decisions must be made with regard to the repercussions circulating Anna's poor choices.<br /><br />The story is beautifully woven, with all ends brought into light at the right moments.  The uniform performances by the entire cast are essential to this story feeling lush, and Knightley, Law, Macdonald, Vikander and especially Macfayden were up to the task at hand.  This was really Wright's movie though, and the way he layers each visual is astonishing to witness.  The idea of transporting every moment to the stage was one met with skepticism and yet one that was so elaborately detailed and so visually compelling.  He captured so much romance and so much desperation through his visual tricks.  The way the dances were staged was just stunning.  Wright is a marvelous technician.  He understands how to choreograph each moment to make it something memorable, something special.<br /><br />`Anna Karenina' is something special.heir affair gets out, shame is placed all over Anna and Karenin, and decisions must be made with regard to the repercussions circulating Anna's poor choices.<br /><br />The story is beautifully woven, with all ends brought into light at the right moments.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|A love story with a twist. Kept me excited to get home and read what was coming next, and was sad that the story has to end.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Highly addictive, fun game for all ages. Only criticism is that the rewards for going up a level are very small compared to the price of the boosts. Perhaps it would be better to get bigger rewards the higher the level. After all it gets hardr to go up a level as the game progresses.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Fun and nostalgic. Wish the ending would have been a bit less abrupt, but still a great read. Must buy for nerd pop culture freaks!
1435106342|5.0|this book arrived in mint condition it was a gift for my granddaughter and she loved it she loves to read she told me a real book beats her kindle any day :)
0062059963|4.0|I have been very excited to read THE ELITE ever since I finished the previous book, The Selection. I fell in love with the whole concept and I was eager to see what was to happen in the next installment. America has fallen for Prince Maxon and she is in the middle of Maxon or Aspen and she has to decide. And if she chooses Maxon, she gets the crown and responsibilities that go with it.<br /><br />There is an terrifying incident early on in the book (which has nothing to do with Aspen or Maxon), that makes America question everything about becoming the prince, parts of the job that she doesn't want or thinks that there is no way that she could possibly do. She begins having doubts and Maxon doesn't make it easy or reassuring for her either.<br /><br />This is where my rant comes in. America is having doubts. Aspen doesn't think she can do it, the princess thing. First of all, why the hell are you talking to Aspen, of course he's going to say no. He wants you to pick him, The public see America in last place, don't worry about what they say. Just have faith in yourself, okay? And how can you not know Maxon has the hots for you, huh? Does he have to come and see you every freaking day for you to feel secure. I have no idea why you are having doubts. He's kept you at the palace this long. And he has told you his thoughts.<br /><br />America just seemed like a weak heroine this time around and it was incredibly irritating. I wanted to knock some sense into her. And she does something incredibly stupid near the end of the book just because she is mad at Maxon and she only thinks of the consequences after she does it. I mean, seriously, what did you expect? I really hated how since she was mad at Maxon near the end, she decides Aspen is the better choice. You cannot base that on a stupid fight you had and had not really talked about with Maxon?! Are you stupid or what?<br /><br />Maxon had some mistakes, but not like America. I feel like America really betrayed Maxon's trust and she needs to earn it back. Maxon is down to the wire and needs to make decisions about these girls, about choosing his wife and he needs America to come to a decision if she wants him or not. There are other girls who deserve to be there. And I agree with him. I think both characters went through a lot through this book with discovering what they want and things about each other.<br /><br />Overall, I loved THE ELITE, but because of the little problems I had with America, I had to drop a star, but it was still great! I couldn't put the book down, just like with The Selection. I think Kiera Cass is freaking amazing and Oh, my god! I can't wait to see the cover of the next book, the synopsis and just get my hands on the actual next book in this outstanding trilogy!st and she needs to earn it back. Maxon is down to the wire and needs to make decisions about these girls, about choosing his wife and he needs America to come to a decision if she wants him or not. There are other girls who deserve to be there. And I agree with him.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is easy and addictive but recently it froze up my kindle for 24 hours. This is my new favorite game. One annoying feature is the limited lives option, however this can be a benefit too when you only want to play for a few minutes. Then the game basically forces you to go do something productive or purchase lives.
0891419063|5.0|I had seen the whole The Pacific series a few times or so and I really Loved it. The ending in the Pacific breaks my heart every time even makes it hard to think it was all over just watching the series. Anyway I wanted to read the books they based them off of so I started with this book. I have read half of it up the the battle of Okinawa then I lost it :/. So far it has been fun to read. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B009SKPVO8|5.0|I bought this strap after a near-tragedy when using the original strap provided by the manufacturer.  I was at the park, trying to get some good shots of my kids, when the strap worked its way out of the plastic clip, and I nearly dropped my camera on the pavement!  I knew there had to be something better!<br /><br />I was immediately thrilled when I found this cross-body strap!  It attaches to the camera by screwing into the tripod mount hardware on the bottom...there is no way it can be pulled loose accidentally!  The shoulder pad is surprisingly comfortable with a nice thick pad. They really thought of everything...there is even an elasticized loop that will perfectly and securely hold my lens cap!  The camera is easy to access when you need it, as it slides effortlessly over the nylon strap, but rests securely at your side when you need to have your hands free.  I have taken my DSLR on many day-long trips, along with a couple of very active young children, and have found the strap to be comfortable enough to wear for hours, even with a heavy lens attached.<br /><br />A note about sizing:  This strap is generously sized, and as a plus size woman, I still find it very comfortable to wear.  Try this camera strap...you will NOT be disappointed!
B004K4AVAG|1.0|Why would any guy like gaga? Her music is lame and its not like they are gonna kiss her, or even marry her, ha ha<br /><br />Anyway I prefer to stick too Frank Zappa, Grateful Dead, etc., jazz and techno music.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I can remember in the 90's turning all the lights in the house and sitting in the living room captivated by the X-files. Not until I watched the first episode of Fringe did I fill that way about another television show. Sure I watched &#34;Lost&#34; and loved mystery of the Island but it did not resonate with me like Fringe and the X-files. I guess I like the detective dramas that still find time to have a sense of humor. The characters are well written with a depth and texture not seen in most weekly dramas. You know a character is well written when they are not on the screen and you find yourself wondering where they are and what are they doing. I found myself doing this with Walter one of the most off the wall dads any one could have. The relationship between Walter and Peter is one of the most complicated I can remember any T.V. series, think mad scientist meets the father from family ties. If you like good character driven Sci-Fi you will love Fringe.
1452115567|5.0|When I first saw pictures of Maddie, I was skeptical that they were real. After a long chat with my own Coonhound, she convinced me that they would indeed do pretty much anything to be close to the human they love and make them smile. What a treasure Maddie's human has shared with us! Thank you so much Maddie and Theron for sharing the life of one Coonhound and her best friend.
1402736924|5.0|My daughter and I have read several books from this series but this was our favorite so far.  It's great bedtime reading for a 2nd grader and full of life lessons to discuss.  We're very GLAD we found it!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  It's not something I would ever have chosen because I am not a fan of the circus in general.  This book was something I never expected and I literally did not want to ever get to the end of it.  The imagination of the author was amazing.  I felt I could literally experience every tent with the characters.  It was fascinating and absolutely fabulous.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Really interesting story with great cinematography. Beautiful pics. Would not recommend for small kids, but loved it for my husband and I..
B005VPRG10|5.0|I bought this for a gift, I was surprise it has a big size, so the kid was very happy
B006JTS5OO|5.0|My daughter and I have been watching this movie non stop. I love that their is both a blue ray, regular and digital copy.
0793573742|5.0|The Les Pauls that Gibson manufactured between 1958 and 1960 are simply the best electric guitars ever made.  Like a  stradivarius violin these hallowed guitars maintain a mystical build and posses a sonic quality and alluring beauty that has defied attempts to equal it or explain it.  Gibson only made about 1700 of these guitars between '58 to '60 and they are the most sought after electrics in all guitardom.  This wonderful book by Yasuhiko Iwanade chronicles these magic 3 years with amazing photographs of these fascinating instruments.  Like a fine wine these sunburst beauties have aged into perfection over the last 50 years.  Most of these guitars were hand sprayed in Cherry sunburst-dyed nitrocellulose lacquer finish but have all aged differently--according to their exposure to the elements and sunlight.  This book allows an amazing gander at these beauties, but also contains some nice interviews of 'burst players and excellent articles concerning the design of this anachronistic instrument. To think in the early 60's the Les Paul was considered as &#34;staid and old-fashioned&#34;.  Ha!  What you could fetch for $280 in 1960 will now cost you close to a million to own.<br /><br />I couldn't help but wonder as I leafed through this excellent book...Who were the bigger fools?...the one's who wouldn't  dish out $280.00 for a Standard back in the day...or the ones who will dish out $500,000.00 + for them now?  I think both.  It's a sad fact that many of these amazing instruments are not able to cry and sing as they were intended, but are now locked into vaults as part of an investment portfolio.<br /><br />Ted McCarty, The chief designer of this guitar (as well as the tune-o'-matic bridge later on) gives a nice foreword.  This is a book that I can't just glance at.  I'm compelled to pick it up and read it whenever it catches my eye.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It It was a great book!  Exciting and keeps you going!  I had a hard time putting the book down after I started it!  Thank you!
0345803485|1.0|BOOOORRRRRRRIIIIINNNNNGGGGG!  I bought the audio and downloaded it on my iPhone. I have a question; did anyone read the other 2 books?  I don't want to waste any more money on this garbage. I am asking because if I hear the words, \\"He murmurs/he murmured.\\" I am going to scream!! I can't for the life of me figure out how any sane woman can be attracted to a guy who is in his mid-twenties who 'murmurs' all of the time.  If a guy who was interested in me pulled that, I would smack him upside the head and ask him how was he able to get INTO college let alone graduate high school with the way he 'talks'.  The author is a 50 year-old woman yet she is NOT smarter than a fifth-grader.  I don't think I want to hear the rest of the audio.  Honestly, it puts me to sleep when I'm on the bus listening to it--but that could be good and bad. (puts me to sleep but I may miss my stop)
B003TJR2HS|4.0|It has a mini usb connector on the side which I needed to power a bluetooth receiver.  I was then able to use it with my older audio receiver.
B0063M22QO|5.0|simple; Well worth downloading!  enjoy the ease of a somewhat mindless game...at least 1st few rounds!! you should try this one
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|I have had this game for a while now, and i loved it. 5 stars. But now, everything i  own has these stupid &quot;revival points.&quot; Whenever i use my units to fight and they dont die, they lose 10-20 pts. If they do, it is more. But what really made me refuse this game was the fact that my best units that i spend days getting only last a day at most, because one little ding and it is gone. They are waaaaay too expensive to revive once dead. I had a game where i went against a guy 20 levels higher than me, barely won, but lost EVERY SINGLE ONE of my units. The old method of random revives was so much better. I now refuse to play this game
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|I do not think it needed to be so explict with the sex  and I am not a prude, just thought it distracted from the story somewhat.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the games but takes alot of time to get coins. Hard for me to upgrade to get a different location example rio or new york.Peris
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This has a great ensemble cast. Good singing, a fun comedy, just the right amount of everything. I recommend it to anyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for me when I am bored I can play it and it dose not take long to load. It never has pop ups and things like that:)
0810993139|5.0|Had to get this book too for my grandson!  Easy to read and he really enjoys them.  He is 8 years young!  Would recommend for ages 6-10!  Great price and with Prime I received expedited free shipping!  Big Win!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This case is great for the Kindle HD. Great for viewing either way and easy to use when charging your Kindle.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Like. NEEDS MORE TOOLS BLOCKS AND ENEMIES. OVERALL a very  good game, but could be better  with lots of new things
B001M0HGR2|5.0|The quality of the movie was just as good as Blu-Ray. I never have a problem with Amazon Prime movie quality. The app for the PS3 needs a lot of work though. Controls such as Pause, Stop, FF, etc. are very unresponsive and I'm often forced to quit the app and restart it in order to resume watching a movie or show.<br /><br />None the less. Majority of my movie collection is digital and online with a service I know is not going any where soon. Amazon Prime.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This, not so cute, app does nothing but teach children how to be mean to cats! What a sad, sad world we live in that we are supposed to get laughs from pretending to hurt animals!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|It's hard to put any of Jane Austin's novels into an hour and a half movie, but this one does it. Screen writers have skillfully edited the story so the heart and soul is preserved, and minor characters and action are not missed. By excerpting Jane's own dialog, the script draws each of the characters exceedingly well in just a few short scenes.  I've only seen one other version of the story, though there may be others. This outshines the other one I've seen.  Highly recommend!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A poignant, disturbing and lovely story.  The writing is beautiful.  There is also a very hilarious scene that required a tissue I was laughing so hard.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Round two.... Ana continues her quest to be the one for Christian in the bedroom while questioning his true intentions. Her thoughts, at times, dilute the story line but the internal draw toward Christian keeps her fears at bay.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it. Great for kids to play the game. Easy to understand what to do then being g confused. Easy to purchase the application.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Considering this is my first erotic book that I have read (yes, this is true) it really opened my eyes to a world foreign to me. A little over the top or at least it seems to be at times. I recommend this book to those that want to explore a different lifestyle in a safe zone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Mind blowing suspense. This book is a page turn hard to put down. I recommend to everyone woman needing spice in their Iife.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Good graphics.  Good story.  Lots of fun.  Not so easy it was boring.<br />Looking forward to additional games by this provider.
B00BF11STU|2.0|From my reading, I know this is not the way Bin Laden was found. The Film leaves you with the feeling that torture is a good idea, the best way to get leads, though maybe  slightly distasteful. Whats distasteful is the Iraq war and George Bush and friends!<br /><br />Film was gritty, but a fantasy all the same. Too serious a subject for a screenplay so at odds with the facts.
B0000844I8|4.0|It was very much like the regular movie but had interesting add in takes. It was worth the money and my husband loved it.
B0028R3G5O|5.0|My wife cant get enought of her CD plays it all the time. It is one of the best CD's she has.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I had misplaced my original cd and was very happy to get this replacement. It sounds great and the music is wonderful!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Not as good as the pc version but really aw esome I am happy to share my review with you AWESOMENESS
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Beautiful cinematography (even if some computer enhancements were used - still stunning). A &#34;feel good&#34; film. I'll definitely watch it again.
8866130915|5.0|I use it to keep track of the weather so I ca compare it with last years weather, gives me an idea of what I need to do with my bees and in planting.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am a reader of all kinds of material. I totally, totally loved the Hunger Games. I hated to come to the end of this trilogy because i know that Suzanne Collins has not come up with a fourth installment of this yet. The problem with  this trilogy is finding another book that i will enjoy as much. Thanks Amazon, Thanks Kindel and Thanks Suzanne Collins.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really great reads! All three books kept me hooked and wanting more. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to be kept on the edge of their seat!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great movie to see in 3d. Really glad I got it for hubby's birthday. Non stop action
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love this show.  It  is a very good commentary on the behavior of humans in dire situations.  If you think this is a show about zombies, you couldn't be more wrong.  Yeah, there are zombies in it, but that isn't what the story is actually about.  Saying that this show is about zombies is kind of like saying the movie &#34;Signs&#34; is about aliens.  If you think so, you probably ought to watch it again.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Finally! Been waiting to get it in 3d. Awesome! Great movie and perfect for the 3d viewing experience. Great purchase!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I really enjoy the Walking Dead. I have been a fan from the very beginning. At times the show seems very drawn out but I really just watch it for the Zombies.
B007712XAU|5.0|We have spent considerable time viewing and reviewing the video and like it more each time. Great acting and story
B005HSL626|5.0|I love playing this Free game and so do my kids. My son loves playing this game and it is free with the option of purchasing the full game.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It's fun but quite often some of my things are missing and pretty much makes you try and buy cash
B005CKPQNE|5.0|One of my favorite shows to watch. I could watch this again and again. I will miss this series when it ends.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Sometimes, it crashes, but I haven't seen any &#34;pattern&#34; to understand why it does (or doesn't) crash at particular moments. It's rare, but on occasion, it will just freeze up.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Nobody puts Baby in a corner! I absolutely love this movie. I never grow tired of watching it and singing along to the songs.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|You need to have an internet connection to use it. For WiFi Kindle users, this is not practical for a Bible &#34;reader.&#34; Get one of the other apps (like the KJV Bible) or download the free ebook (ESV Bible). Then, you can read in the park or on the go...
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I enjoyed the plot of this book. I feel like it could've been written a tad bit better. The characters seemed to be forced together.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Kind of hard to remember that this is a prequel for a children's book. So many of the reviews here have forgotten that. I found it extremely entertaining and just plain fun to watch. Let's try to remember that films that are based on children's stories have to stay true to those roots in some way. I was entertained. The real reason I go to see any movie. My wife was also entertained.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|I enjoyed Tess of the D'ubervilles. You fall in love with Tess' innocence. You fall in love with Tess right away she is so sweet and innocent. Her story is nothing but tragedy. Her demise is sad.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It was great until the latest update. Now it won't open. It starts to load then forces closed or freezes.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I love both seasons 1 and 2. I would recommend watching it. It may not be suitable for the young ones more of a teen/adult show.
0671449028|4.0|good book for a child who is too young to read for himself.  made the child giggle.  great pictures exhibited.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|One of my favorite shows!! I love watching it. Season one is my favorite. Season two is just as a good to watch.
B008XG1X18|5.0|downloading this on my kindle, made pinterest feel more like an exploration of idea's then the website.<br />that may be silly to say, but its more about the presentation for me.<br /><br />I like the site well enough, but the kindle app, made it a bit more personal for me.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show.  It's fun to watch. I have enjoyed season two as much as I enjoyed season one.
B004SBULWE|5.0|i use this for all my Android devices, and I love the product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!<br />Also , it works great on phones!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|I love this movie. I can watch it again and again. The love story is bittersweet. Tim Burton did a great job on this film.
B0090EKRKU|5.0|What a great family movie. Even my husband liked it. It kept my 2 year olds attention most of the time too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works really well with my Kindle. Easy to use and I haven't noticed any glitches. I would recommend this application.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a great family movie. My 2 year old and 7 year old both loved it (even dad). It was very cute and not scary.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I liked the book. It seems like the characters were forced together with no real build up to their endeavors.
B000002WPI|5.0|You just can't beat the Wu-Tang Clan. This is the only s*** i listen to in the car and in the gym.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love watching this show and I cannot wait for the next season to start. I was drawn into the series after watching the first episode.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book is written like a diary, but from two perspectives. It was interesting and different from other books because of this.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The last book was more of an enjoyable read for me. I loved the suspense/love. This book was my favorite out of the three.
B005IQZB14|1.0|Can't enjoy a book if you dislike the main character.She is very self indulgent and stupid for going on this trip ill prepared.Her lack of morality was disturbing.Amazing she was not attacked.<br />As a nurse,I found it very hard to believe that she didn't get a severe infection in her foot.<br />Our book club did not care for it,some couldn't get past the 1st chapter
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot get enough of Downton Abbey. I have fallen in love with the characters. When I start to despise a character, I'm quickly accepting of them. I cannot wait to watch the next season!!!
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|I couldn't imagine being in this situation... being a teenager I could really relate to how the kids in the film were portrayed and they were spot on.  The performances were so good and the story truly captured the fear and isolation after the tsunami hit... cinematography was great as well to make you rwally feel like you were there in the thick of it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app works really well with my Kindle Fire. I would recommend the Free download. Has the same capabilities as my phone application.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|There are So many versions of the same thing, this one just happened to be first on the list I came to when searching....
0316098515|5.0|An awesome book from start to finish, will continue to find inspiration from this book for a long time to come.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie whenever it would be on.  The music is wonderful.  I had it on VHS and finding it in dvd was always difficult.  I was glad to get it in blu-ray.  Very sharp and clear.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|The size, though outside dimensions are given, is what I used to estimate whether my stuff would fit.  I ordered this for my new Lumix G5 with two lens and they fit perfectly but snug (no extra room for the lens hoods).  Quality is good and all this for $12 delivered (plus tax).
0553386794|5.0|I made the mistake of watching the first season of HBO's adaptation prior to reading this, the first novel of the series.  The book blew the TV series away within the first five chapters.  And it just got better from there.<br /><br />The characters are both fantastic and believable, some times so much so that I wanted to reach out and grab some of them and say, \\"stop acting like a real person, what you're doing is going to get you killed!\\"  The stories, though disconnected, are just interconnected enough to keep one wondering if they are going to collide.  All in all, a fabulous beginning to what looks to be a terrific series.
B0081336FO|5.0|I just think it is an overall great series. It keeps your interest and it feels so much more involved being 1.5hrs instead of the traditional hour or 1/2 hour. The actors are great and it has enough humor to keep you relaxed in between tense moments.
B008P9M614|5.0|This is a must have if you are a house fan. Every episode plus extras. Can't say enough about it.
0684857219|5.0|I can't say that there isn't a better work available out there.<br /><br />I CAN say that in years past I've purchased a couple of books such as &#34;The Weider System of Bodybuilding&#34; and &#34;Bodybuilding: The Weider Approach.&#34;  And this &#34;New Encyclopedia&#34; is so much better than these it isn't even close.<br /><br />This book is marketed as one that is equally necessary for both the novice and amateur bodybuilder as well as the champion Mr. Olympia.  I kind of find that a silly approach and since I'm NOT a &#34;Mr. Olympia&#34; and very definitely won't be becoming one any time soon, how great it is for champion bodybuilders is unimportant to me.<br /><br />I'm reviewing this book according to my own need: an encyclopedia of weight training exercises; the muscles that each exercise works; photographs to demonstrate each exercise; and suggested workouts to help a bodybuilder put the exercises into his or her own workout.  And to that end, the book simply is excellent.<br /><br />For the record, I didn't see a single picture of a female bodybuilder (apart from when they happened to be standing next to the men).  So &#34;designed for women bodybuilders&#34; hardly fits.  But I submit that a woman could look over the exercises and put together a training routine just about as well as a man.<br /><br />Many (but not most) of the 800 pages are devoted to aspects of bodybuilding that I simply don't care about, such as posing and being photographed in such a way to make your muscles look their best.  I'll let other people discuss how good those sections are and just stick to what I bought the book for.  All I wanted was an encyclopedia of bodybuilding exercises.<br /><br />The pictures are all black and white, but there are a LOT of them.  It's a great work for the photographs alone.<br /><br />The thing that I will say is that, having looked at the exercises and the description on how to do them and the muscles that are involved (for instance, what workout would you do to maximize the impact of your INNER chest?), I believe that this book will get regular use in my library.  And if there's a better book out there to this end, I'll buy it too and still be glad I got this one.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great, suspenseful movie! Both my husband liked it which we usually have a hard time agreeing on a good movie
B001F12J0C|5.0|The Bourne series is simply one of the best for action, pace, chases and plot. The packaging was goo, too.
B005LAII8A|2.0|I don't like movies with child violence. Hard to follow plot and the main guy was not very good. Bruce Willis was the only good part
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was displeased with this book: written to hastily. She really could have done something great with the ending, with a new human civilization beginning. Falls way short of the first two books. Bummer.
0553824414|1.0|I have read them all. If you picked this as the first to read, I say too bad for you at the airport book store.<br /><br />Lee Child had a deadline on this and no good idea. That's ok. He has a very high batting average. This time he struck out.
B0040X46TE|5.0|I love IZ's music. I have bought this CD for me, my Mom, my husband, and now my nephew. My kids even listen to it!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have been delighting in solving these puzzles for months now. Thank you ximad for the wonderful selection of puzzles. highly recommended also for the range of options for number of puzzle pieces, ability to rotate them, and I love that the pieces snap and stay together, once placed side by side.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At a very stressful appointment, our lawyer introduced this game to us. Now, me, my husband, and even my Mom (who doesn't play many games) play it. I have also showed people at work. They love it too!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|There aren't many games that can keep my attention all the way to the end but this one did so therefore it gets 5 stars.
B00992CF6W|4.0|When I went away from the world it was fine but when I returned some of my house was gone there was no monsters please fix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001GPX|5.0|Under the guiding hand of a great conductor, the Beethoven came alive. This is a &#34;must have&#34; album to enhance your colklection.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I felt this book really got to the truth and showed me the person who was Michael Jackson and not just the performer.<br />I completed this book in a couple days as it held my interest all the way to the end.
B000BZISTE|5.0|it is just as i remembered the movie  love it<br />i have watched it more than once since i got it
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|Wonderful for my grocery list that I always seem to not have when I get to the store.<br />Just got it so haven't really used it for other note taking yet.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I picked this book up on the recommendation of some friends, since they know how much I love gaming, its history, and all things geek. After finishing it, I can't thank them enough for recommending it to me.<br /><br />I found myself immediately hooked on this book. I even stayed up way too late because I wanted to keep going and going and going. I just really could not put it down. I mean, there's giant fighting robots, murder, and tons of 80s pop culture and gaming references. What more could a geek want in a book?<br /><br />Other than those things, the world-building is crazy well done as far as the worlds of the OASIS go. The descriptions of the planets and sectors and landscapes and ships and even avatars is incredible. It made it super easy to visualize everything that went on in the OASIS, even though it was a virtual world. I also can't complain about the real-world world-building done in this book. The descriptions are just.. perfect. Not too wordy, but describe everything to a T.<br /><br />Like the title says, I was seriously genuinely a bit depressed when this book ended. I wanted it to keep going on. I wanted to keep following the lives of Wade, Aech, Art3mis, and Shoto. I wanted to find out what happened with the Sixers after the Hunt ended. I wanted to know what part Og played in the main characters' lives from then on. I just did NOT want it to end. At all.<br /><br />I'm on the lookout for similar books, but I'm a bit doubtful that anything similar will be able to top this book for me. If you're a geek, someone who grew up in the 80s, or just someone looking for an awesome page-turner, this is the book for you. The price is a bit steep for the Kindle edition, but hey, I can't say I regret spending the $10 for how much I got into this book and wanted Wade to succeed. Really. Over and over again, I found myself rooting for him and getting angry at the Sixers and hoping that him and the other main characters would persevere no matter what.
B002PJN59M|5.0|Spellbound is the way to put this movie, literally and figuratively. The transfer to HD is decent but not great, but the movie itself is excellent. Much violence, some nudity and sex, and a visual feast. An adult who lets a kid watch this should be boiled in oil.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Maybe I've just been reading too many \\"dystopian\\" stories lately, but The Martian was like a ray of sunshine. The main character has a great outlook on life, and throughout his ordeal you just know he's going to be OK. This is a perfect pool-side summer read, or cozy, bedtime page-turner for Science Fiction fans who like to see a SNAFU presented, and then un-SNAFUed by a resourceful, good-natured, and very lucky protagonist.<br /><br />The Martian has spoiled me, and I'm sure I'll have a hard time finding other inexpensive, well-written, and fun stand-alone books for Kindle.
0425252868|5.0|A very well researched series of events and presented in a credible and enjoyable to read style. I recommend this fascinating book to everyone.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This is a riveting and Intriguing story with lots to think about.  Engaged in the story the entire time. It is definitely worth watching!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  A real page turner especially towards the end. I couldn't put it down.
1932735410|5.0|This book is the real deal. I was successful passing PMP exam. I've read other PMP prep book but this is the best one. Rita really explains the methodology of project management which is critical on passing the PMP exam. I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Victor
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so awesome and you get to update it and do Easter egg hunts and go to cool places like greece Sydney and Rome but sometimes when you swipe left it makes you roll and then die but other than that this game is so amazing.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Really fun hidden object game. Objects are not always in the same spot. And it has several different challenging things like a dark room that you have to move a circle of light around room to find the objects.
031237593X|5.0|First, a little story - by the books I recently read, it may be obvious that I'm all over medieval England and War of the Roses especially. Funnily enough, I was hardly aware of the subject until March the 3rd, 2012, when I've read a childhood favorite \\"The Black Arrow\\" by R.L.Stevenson. It takes place during the war and mentions the completely awesome, if a bit of a prick, Duke of Gloucester and the House of York. Obviously, I wanted to know more and this place was very helpful and everywhere I looked on the net, I came across one book:<br /><br />I looked for it in bookstores and they had none. In fact, they didn't have a single Penman between them. After being robbed blind by some hackers I've forsworn Internet shopping and knowing no one who didn't, I've quite dispaired. Until one day I remembered a conversation I overheard in a book store years ago, about the possibility of ordering a book from overseas through the store itself and so I did. It took over a month for the book to arrive and when it did, I've began reading the very same day.<br /><br />It says on the cover that it is the story of Richard III but it is so much more than that. The cast is enormous and not one of them is a support character - each has a story of their own, each has a voice, a past, friends and rivals. I was surprised that even the little people, like Rob Apsall and Ankarette Twynyho, who would have been but a footnote in any other novel, hardly even given a name, have an environment around them, their own little worlds.<br />The events span years and have ups and downs (and since it's war with two side to it, what is up for Yorks is down for Lancasters and vice versa) and though Richard, especially in the later years, is usually present, it's not all about him. Another one who is constantly present, if only in spirit as being dead for some years, is Edmund, the second York brother, ignobly murdered while being a prisoner of war.<br />I liked Richard, not only by virtue of being the main character, but because of him being a real person, with loves and hates, never perfect, always trying to do his best. His relationship with his wife Anne I've found to be lovely, like a real normal couple, though with far to many problems and responsibilities for someone so young. Anne herself is a great character, a true woman who knows her duty. Though being sceptical at first, I really liked \\"The Adventures of Two Noblwomen in the Slums\\" episode.<br />Another couple I like, separately and together, are Edward and Elizabeth. Edward is awesome. One can feel his radiance and energy through the page and he says the funniest things sometimes. Elizabeth is not some low-born wannabe slutty witch (though those are convenient insults to use against her) but a grown woman, of less-than-noble birth (on one side at least), with, yes, a large family, people she wants to take care of, now that she's reached prominence.<br />I've read the first 700 pages in a few days and the last 200 in over a week, such is the burden of forward knowledge. I did not, emphatically, want to get to the end. In fact, I wanted to do a Joey and put the book in the freezer.<br /><br />But I soldiered on, and though the final battle broke my heart a bit, it was, at the same time, the awesomest thing ever.<br /><br />The book is over 900 page long and every one of them is well used. The best thing is we meet those people as children and get to know them growing up and when they do something in later life, we don't ask \\"eh? what'd he do that for?\\", we know, because we know them.<br /><br />Two things, two tiny little things, in 944 pages, bothered me - if it is acknowledged that this is Richard III, the painting of the portrait episode was unfortunately lacking. As well, Humphrey of Gloucester is presented as the son of Thomas of Woodstock, while being the son of Henry IV, which is such a weird mistake to make.<br /><br />To conclude, I love this book immensely and look forward to reading it again in the coming years.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game; it offers a variety of settings which are great. it's a great free app.
0062080237|5.0|The book is, as hinted in the title, about America and it's Gods, old and new. It's also a road-trip story, describing places, real and imagined, one cannot help Googling afterwards.<br /><br />I'm not usually a fan of fantasy but this is one book I couldn't put down, when I first read it in a Hebrew translation about a year ago.<br />One of the New Year's gifts for myself was this book in English and it was even better.<br />It's written in a very straightforward manner. It's very funny when needs to be and dramatic at times.<br />I've decided to give it a try (despite being a fantasy book) after enjoying \\"Good Omens\\" and read \\"Stardust\\", \\"Neverwhere\\" and \\"Anansi Boys\\" since, and \\"American Gods\\" takes all the elements from those books and enhances them and makes them bigger and better, and is, to me, the best Gaiman book.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|Its been forever since I've tried locating this specific movie and couldn't anywhere near me. the quality was great and it brought back lots of memories. i loved it!
0439023521|5.0|Well this book lived up to a lot of the hype that surrounds it. While the name and cover still do not grab my attention the story, once started, did.<br /><br />This book is written in first perspective, from the heroine's aspect. Her name is Katniss Everdeen. She starts off in her home, a simple, poor area of the land. She is the provider for her mother and sister with her hunting skills. To protect her younger sister, she is sent to the capitol, along with local boy Peeta, to 'participate' in the annual Hunger Games.<br /><br />These 'games' are fights to the death, aired and shown to the capitol and all 12 districts under its control, in a survival arena of sorts. The book shows, throughout the story, a somewhat futuristic dystopia society. The tributes (Katniss, Peeta and others in the game) are given basic weapons (bows, spears, clubs) and the district where Katniss is from uses herbs and eats basic foods (squirrel, wild turkey, etc) but the capitol has voice command room service, automatic hair dryers, and a camera/screen set that tracks and shows the tributes (no matter where they go) to the viewers. It is an interesting combination.<br /><br />There is a 'romantic' setting as well. Katniss and Peeta are to appear as a united team to the people. Peeta even admits to liking her during his interview. So a setting for 'star-crossed lovers' is created. However, Katniss has various feelings toward Peeta throughout the book and its very realistic and understandable, especially when there is possibly another guy back home.<br /><br />Yet while there are time I can relate to her, at the same time several of her thoughts want to make my roll my eyes or drop my head onto a desk. While she is survival smart, she is not people smart. She can't socialize and cannot read people worth a darn. While it is annoying at times, it is also endearing and has created a unique character.<br /><br />Overall, very good book. 4 1/2 stars is my official opinion, but I will give it 5 since I can't do halves. Its a constant pace of survival, and action with just the right touch of romantic possibilities.ce I can't do halves. Its a constant pace of survival, and action with just the right touch of romantic possibilities.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved the way the author went back and forth through Jamie's life.  This book took you through the gamut of emotions.  Great Read
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I'm a huge &#34;Doctor Who&#34; fan, and my other Whovian friends told me I would love this show. I kept putting off watching it, but I saw that it had Jewel Staite in it, from two of my other favorite past shows &#34;Higher Ground&#34; and &#34;Flash Forward&#34;. This show is amazing! It's funny, thrilling, and full of twists. It may have only lasted one season, but not for lack of being interesting, that's for sure.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|People kept telling me I had to see this show. I don't have the channel it's on so I decided to watch it from here. It's really great and riveting
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I liked the book, but it was not as good as the movie.<br /><br />It was a quick read and a good deal on the kindle price, $2.99.
B0042FZOFU|2.0|I am not sure where this is from, but it's not the US. It has a different web address for any Disney movie rewards points. So I didn't receive those. Movies played ok in my region, but very disappointed in the whole process.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|fun game! entertaining and fast paced! if you like all the other jewel games you'll live this one and its free! :)
B0039TAHMA|4.0|I loved this movie and could not wait to watch the next one. Now I will read the books and see how true to the books they kept this Movies.
B008XCPO2Q|4.0|This movie was not made for Oscar acting or plot (which it lacks) but its entertaining which lets be honest was the purpose of this movie & the sequel they are making.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Good movie for children and the ideas of working together to help each other out<br />is evident throughout the movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and very addictive. Not only could you connect to Facebook, but there are also life savers as well.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|Another movie I have had in my movie collection that I  and a great addition to our movies.upgraded to Blu Ray.  It  too has added extras

B002GHIPYI|4.0|Pros: Great headphones, they sound great and they are aesthetically pleasing. It has a thick cord that can take a beating.<br /><br />Cons: A bit bright for my taste, after long periods of time, the pads make your ears hot. And for some people the system it employs in order to stay on your head might be a bit uncomfortable(Those with larger heads, afros, poofy or spiked hair).  I ended up detaching the side holders from the leather top piece because they pushed down on my head a lot.<br /><br />Thoughts: It would be nice if they employed a system in which you can regulate how much pull on the top piece is generated. Also a detachable cord from the headphones themselves would be desired.
0805047905|5.0|my daughter and I loved reading this to each other. we would work in the animal sounds sometimes and get creative with it.
B00009NQQO|4.0|We bought this for our 18 month old for Easter.  It is the perfect size for his age and can still play with it as he grows.  The suction cups work very well and is easily removed when needed.<br /><br />I would have liked to see it without the catching net, rather with the bottom cut out.  If it's a little higher, he wants to stand to retreive the balls, or whatever it is he threw in it.<br /><br />Overall, would buy again!
1400069742|2.0|I had to put this book down.  I felt I was reading the biography of Lindberg instead of a history of WW2 and Roosevelt. It is not what I expected.  Boring.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|excellent movie. received in a timely manner. I hope that there will more of these movies produced for those of use waiting for the saga to continue.
B0064MT1U8|5.0|This is one of the best movies, for entertainment, that I have ever seen.  It may be too sexy for some people.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game for passing the time. Great potential in being a great game. Very nice that the game allows you to gather money while gone. Only big issue is pace, though I suppose it would be better if I paid for things.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Watch this great flick to finish the above.<br /><br />Love the ensemble cast.<br />Love the Indian scenery.<br />Love the &#34;clash&#34; of cultures.<br /><br />Watched it three times already and will probably do so annually from here on out.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|When I heard about this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. What I got was something predictable--and yet not quite.Matthew Mac Connohey is the lawyer, who has an office in his Lincoln Continental. His dealings are somewhat shady, but he does stay within the limits of the law. Most of his clientele are rough,but he knows his way around them. He has a good reputation for getting people off and his next case is a strange one. The man is seeking to go free, problem is, he is really guilty, but because of client lawyer confidentiality he cannot do much against it. There is a plot twist here, and not without some dark humor. You'll have to watch and see.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love jigsaw puzzles. This one is the best. No problems on my kindle fire. The number of jigsaw puzzles seems limitless.  You get about 12 puzzles in each theme pack for only. $0.99. There are about 4 levels to play per puzzle.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|This game had no guidance. I spent more time getting hints that led me nowhere. I would not recommend this game to anyone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|To make it short: Great books, great story (a bit diferent than the movie, or rather very diferent if you consider the games) and totaly non-cliche ending.<br /><br />And I wouldn't really consider it violent, it's rather, well, quite realistic considering the cruelty of life. But then again life is violent :P<br /><br />Ne ways. I totally loved the books and I totaly recommend it to everyone. Not just young adults.
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie was almost as good as the book, i would definitely suggest trying to pick up the book first, but not necessary.

B00B2YH7D6|4.0|I enjoyed getting an inside look at part of the history and process of recording music, and getting to see some rock legends in candid interviews.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Honestly, this is one of the best POP/R&B albums I've owned. And that's coming from someone who isn't (wasn't) a huge Bruno fan.<br /><br />His newest album is one of the most entertaining albums I've ever listened to. Each song has a unique story he's telling that's easy and fun for the listener to follow along with. Some songs are vulgar. Others are touching and sweet. Some are sexy. And some show his less-than-perfectness. And then you have to mention his wide range of musical styles: Pop, slow jams, R&B, even a little reggae thrown in for good measure. Just keeps you on your toes.<br /><br />Like my title says, if he doesn't win a Grammy or two for this album, it would be a crime!
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|Like many other people who saw this crazy idea, I too agree with them. The only reason I would buy this is because the movie is great and if they price it correctly other than that I wouldn't, I would wait years if I have 2 before I buy it. That is crazy insane; I just imagine Mr. crabs from Spongebob making this decision lol. I wish they make some changes before the release. I do want it to be part of movie collection.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Kurt was really psychotic in this movie. But he got his just desserts in this one by the stunt women. Funny as heck
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Big fish comes thru again.  This game is very relaxing as a puzzle game, yet keeps you on the edge of your seat until you conquer the challenge.  Great game lots of fun.  Only downfall is that it takes up quite a bit of space so make sure you have the room as it is well worth it.
1449408656|5.0|My mom loved this book.  She was quite amused.  Her four cats saw it as me trying to make passive commentary on my mom's cat lifestyle.  They were all correct.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I love all the information one gets with this app. I think it takes awhile to load unlike on my iPad. The map seems way too pixelated for today`s technology.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|What can I say! This is a great flick and definitely bears the mark of a Pixar (Disney) classic! Great for both kids and adults (One of the few my ywo year old will watch for more than 5 minutes ;)
B003F48E4W|4.0|I came into this because I saw on imdb that Jami Gertz was in it, and I didnt remember her in this, so I rented it. I had fairly low expectations, as most vampire movies from the 80s generally don't stand the test of time. I was born in the late 80s, so I was familiar with the plot and cast before going into this, but I DEFINITELY recommend this to my 90s born friends looking for a good movie to waste a weekend with. It's not too terribly cheesy and you might be surprised who you recognize (24! That lady from that sitcom! Corey and Corey!) around the acting is a tad bit (and I say this with love!) hammy but it's a vampire movie and honestly, it comes with the territory! Good for a rent, so give it a go!<br /><br />RIP Corey Haim... May you live on in your best work!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|High quality acting and typical Tarantino humor.  Very violent but not like anything else you will rent. Controlled chaos by a genius

B00AIJP9BS|3.0|Only played for a few minutes in the tutorial so far, but it seems like a pretty good game if you like foosball. However, I found the tilt and controls to be a little difficult. If the opposite team has the ball, it's not immediately apparent what your players can do to block. Some better direction in the tutorial would have been appreciated. Would have given it 3.5 stars if possible. Permissions seem ok.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|This book was just as good as the first, burn in actually very mad that I've waited almost a year to read this one thinking it was the last and its not. I'm mad!!! How many more books will there be and when will the next be available? Otherwise I might not read the next, that's how disappointing it was. Sorry. It's a good book....
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I have loved this series from get go. First I ordered the entire series from Amazon in Lg. Print. By the time I had just started<br />Breaking Dawn Pt. 2. I believe the first part was already out in your nearest Theater. I waited until I had finished the book before I would watch it from the get go. By reading all the books first, I was better to understand what was going on in the movies.<br /><br />But as we all know, that the book and the movie are not of the same. They leave out most of the really gory stuff that's in the book, but not the movie. I can not understand the reasoning behind this. If anyone has an answer as to why they do this, I would be very interested in knowing your thoughts on this subject, an thanks in advance for your reply .
B0022W6L6G|4.0|This is a really good (and comprehensive) greatest hits album by Fleetwood Mac, a pretty good band, but how could they leave my favorite song -- &#34;The Chain&#34; -- off? It's from Rumours, one of their classic albums, and I love that song. This is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five. Otherwise, it's a good buy.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Gerald Butler is the &#34; MAN &#34;  in this movie. What he had to do just to dig that tunnel, equipped with anything and everything. Completely lit up, rail car to haul all that dirt. So here's the question ?  What happened with all that dirt, an we all know with a tunnel that long, width, an height. What ever happened with the dirt, he did have that tunnel dugout in less then 3 hours T.V. time that is.<br /><br />How he went into each task, he wants the best results in the end. Boy did he succeed at that, until the very last. then he goes boom by his own bomb.  I bet that pissed him off something fierce.<br /><br />This movie kinda reminds me of,  &#34; Man on Fire &#34;  with Danzel Washington.  He was totally ruthless in that movie.<br /><br />An I actually did really like that movie also. it was kick - ass, totally it was.
1400049628|5.0|Love post apocalypse stuff.  This plays right into the stuff that I like.  Look forward to reading World War Z as well.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|At first the book was a little bit confusing. We did not expect the stories to cut off as abruptly as they did. Especially the first story, Ewing's story. It seems that you are just getting into it, finally starting to realize what's happening, then you turn the page and... boom. The author has moved on to a new character, a new setting and a completely unrelated conflicft. At first I didnt see any of the connections between the random characters the author was stringing together in an inexplicable line. It was only when the rest of my group members mentioned the similar birthmarks and characteristics that things began to tie together. Although the first chapter is a little bit slow, and the transition extremely confusing, if you can put that behind you the storyline folds out into an incredile connection. I don't want to give anything away. I personally enjoyed this book very much because I like the mystery of trying to connect the dots as I'm reading. It's definitely worth reading if you can make it through the jumble.

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Sometimes it can be a little predictable, but this is a fun series for the horror lover.  Dark and twisty.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Very much enjoyed this movie.  Jones was great in it. Lewis and Fields were a perfect fit.  Should have just purchased rather then rented.
0765325950|5.0|Was a good end to the saga, lots of twists. Was very sad to see the last of all these familiar characters
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game os really fun. I like how they set it up so its almost endless. there are so many levels and you have to unlock them by playing the games. you can also read about the game before you choose to unlock it. just a little hint if your having trouble with a game just play with the screen upside down. it help me pass a few levels I was stuck on.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love my angry birds and to be able to get it free is even better. The ads aren't really that irritating to me so I just keep on playing the game.

B009LT1YZ6|3.0|I love the fact of the tilting of the tablet to move around. The game is challenging which frustrates me but I can't seem to be drawn in to play for long periods of time. I usually only play for small time intervals. Great game to kill alittle bit of time if you don't mind moving your tablet alot.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|... she said that it was a life-changing experience watching this movie. It left her a sense of compassion and understanding for people with drug addictions.

B0001E7LMU|4.0|Very easy to learn. I very much enjoy the instant deception factor. You find out very quickly who the Saboteurs are and have a blast trying to put a stop to them. Since it's 3 rounds, everyone usually gets a chance to be the bad guy(s) before the game is over. The only thing it needs is more expansions to add more elements to it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I really like the game and enjoy playing it with friends and family. I just wish there was a way to cancel games that go inactive after a few days. I like to play random people and sometimes those games don't pan out to well. I love to see people's talents in drawing.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Depeche Mode is my favorite band. I became a fan back in 1983, and my first vinyl I ever bought was the 'People Are People' 45 single and 12&#34; Maxi-Single back in 1984. I have to say, I have loved every album they have released. I love the band's first album 'Speak & Spell', and every album after. I loved 'Exciter', the 2001 album some fans say they don't care for, but I love it. I also loved the band's last album before 'Delta Machine', 2009's &#34;Sounds Of The Universe'. I am a real die-hard fan. I own all the vinyl, 12&#34; Vinyls, 45's. I have almost all the albums on cassette, up until 'Ultra&#34; (1997), I own all the albums on CD, all the remixes, they truly are my favorite band. 'Delta Machine' was a sweet surprise when it came out recently, I love it, from beginning to end.<br />  While some fans complain about DM's last album 'Sounds Of The Universe', I actually love that album, and for awhile it was my #1 favorite Depeche album, up until this point. 'Delta Machine' has taken the top spot for me (Some Great Reward, Violator, Black Celebration and Playing The Angel were all at one time my top favorites).<br />  This new album 'Delta Machine' is classic Depeche Mode with some very modern sounds woven throughout. I hear sounds and styles from many previous past albums, yet it's very new, modern and fresh. Plus a few new sounds and styles I've never heard Depeche Mode use before. Not one bad track on this album, from the opening to the end, it's grabs you and doesn't let go. The track order flows nicely, my favorite songs are 'Alone', 'Angel', 'Secret To The End', 'Broken', 'Should Be Higher', 'Heaven'.... ok, so I am basically going to end up naming off the whole album, including the second single 'Soothe My Soul' and also the bonus Tracks on Disc 2 of the Deluxe Version. This whole album does not disappoint. It's a great album, in the sense that 'Black Celebration' was great, or 'Sounds Of The Universe' was great. No big hits are on 'Delta Machine' justa bunch of great sings, and a few good choices for singles, but no 'Enjoy The Silence' or 'Precious', and that's fine. I think the song 'Angel' would make a great single, crossing my fingers for that one. I thought 'Heaven' was a great first single, keeping us all on our toes, and full of surprises. In my opinion Depeche Mode keep getting better and better, with each release. I think the closing track 'Goodbye' is epic, and reminds me of the Beatles a bit, I am in love with the sexual, dirty, sleazy-ness of 'Slow', classic Depeche Mode sounds there, with a Delta Blues twist. Martin's 'The Child Inside' is dreamy, floats along and is creepy at the same time. I think 'Should Be Higher' is a stand out track, with classic 'Violator' vibes. 'Soft Touch/Raw Nerve' is DM channeling U2 from the early 90's, and with great effect. One of the biggest surprises is the song 'My Little Universe' which starts off very Thom Yorke-ish and ends on a very mid-90's techno/trancey note. AWESOME. Another favorite is 'The Secret To The End', which brings to mind The Cure's dark, gothic-ness, but very electro/electronic, and very classic Depeche Mode. The opener tot he album 'Welcome To My World' was also a surprise, as it is a new style for DM, but works perfectly. There is something here for everyone.<br />  This album goes at the top of the list as one of their best, I am very proud of Depeche Mode for recording such a masterpiece, so proud of them, this is a great addition to a huge and amazing catalog of music. Love it!
B00683JK9K|4.0|It's a fun puzzle game. It isn't very challenging but it's still a fun way to put a puzzle together without having to worry about losing pieces.
B00B6SIT0S|5.0|Great song, and love the remixes! The Owlle Mix is great! The b-side is album worthy material. Check it out!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like it I just wish the radar mapping worked better and let me save my settings. Other than that it works great for giving me up to date weather.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The movie its ok but with to many quality control issues.<br />It keeps you entertained but not much that that.
B005LAIIHG|2.0|I enjoyed the ability to co-exist but...that's it<br />He should have continued with the story.<br />Where did the tiger end up?
0848810112|5.0|As I have said before, Janice Holt Giles took the reader on a wild ride through Kentucky,  and later,<br />Santa Fe.  I was amazed that one of my students, a junior in the high school at which I taught, read her books and did a complete family tree of the Fowler family.  My favorite, \\"Voyage to Santa Fe\\" made me feel the stuggle to get prarie schooners across the land and up to Santa Fe. I wish someone knew of another author who wrote about the 1800's in the West!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed Eleanor and Park.  The slowly developing relationship between them was beautifully accomplished.  I fell in love with them.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Love this music in the movie. Great sound CD!!!<br />If you like the movie you will love the CD. Wonderful
B000065U1N|5.0|Item was great and it was as described. I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend to a friend.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|I won't buy blue ray again. I already ordered a dvd so I can watch it.I loved the movie but hated the blue ray.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|The Elite was a decent sequel to the Selection, but not the best.<br /><br />I liked that Maxon and America's relationship has been fleshed out, but the love triangle gets a little annoying.  It seems like America has already made her choice but then little things keep getting thrown into the mix to keep the love triangle going and honestly it seems a little unnecessary. There doesn't have to be a love triangle in every young adult novel, and in this one in particular it seems as if it could have been just as good without it.<br /><br />The dystopian society isn't entirely fleshed out here and really doesn't feel like a true dystopian even though there was an attempt made to better explain the society's history.<br /><br /> This book shows its \\"Bachelor\\" a lot more, introducing situations between Maxon and the other girls...situations that I personally found took away from what I thought Maxon's true character was.  However I guess it adds to the love triangle confusion...if that's your type of thing.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't astounded by this second novel, but I'll still read the third one because I want to know what happens next.  But I worry that the third novel will resemble the 3rd Hunger Games book in which so much of it focuses on the rebel forces and pushes the character development to the side.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I had heard about this game about 3 weeks ago.  After that I couldn't stop seeing people make references to it.  No one I knew owned a copy of the game, so I bought one myself--glad I did!<br /><br />I have yet to play this with someone who didn't thoroughly enjoy it and want to make plans to play it again soon.  Literally all of my friends are getting hooked on this game.<br /><br />It's interesting because people will start to develop their own play style, and each game makes you have to tweak that style considerable.  You start to become amazed with what you and your friends come up with based off of how the board is laid out.  The learning curve isn't too bad either so it's never hard to bring someone new into the mix.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Loved the game until I got to the return of the Jedi level. So you have 2 options to continue playing. Go back and get 3 stars on every single level or pay $1.99. Really? I mean really? I'm not that hardcore that 2 stars is not good enough for me. Heck some levels get all the pigs in one bird and it gives you 1 star, is that the trap? I paid $2.99 for what I assumed was a full version. I'd give that 1 star if I didn't enjoy the game thus far. Buyer beware. It's a bait and switch.
B006LSZECO|1.0|note;  My email address has changed to annbarron27@gmail.com<br /><br />The story started out to be interesting and fairly well written.  By mid-point the writing had deteriorated<br />to fifth grade level and the plot read like a comic book.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|. Hard and unsuall  i need more simple and sheap. I study with competitor and like because is more fast Hard
1593082800|2.0|I really tried to read this book. I read several chapters into it.  But the constant flipping back & forth between characters was a headache for me. I'm guessing further on in, it got better, but I just gave up.  I just couldn't get into it.  I finally closed it up & have donated it to the library where I work.  Maybe someone else will read it.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Luv My Lenny is all I can say...Great CD.Has All the songs on it I was looking for.I consider it a Great Buy

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like the way in turns and is hilly. It has much better graphics and is more detailed. Do get. It's free!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I like this item but the fact that even after contacting Customer Service I found it's only available in white isn't my idea of an ideal match to my black Kindle, case, stylus, headphones... you get my drift.  C'mon Amazon, you can do better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It may not be as good as the real deal, but worth the seven bucks. If you love minecraft, then you should get this.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is an amazing film - I never tire of the scenary, the lines - 'muzzle your dog' and the symbolism behind caring for the earth and its inhabitants.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|don't want to keep playing because you have to pay for glue points to get better upgrades. but other then that fun game tip you get to that point.
0765325950|3.0|I don't think it was bad per se, but I was a little disgruntled by the massive amount of the book devoted to the battle scenes.  Of course Tarmon Gai'don would require a lot to cover but would it have killed Sanderson to give us a few post-TG chapters??  I can only hope that maybe they're planning to release a novel/novels in the future of fourth age stuff.  The evolution of the Black Tower (I'd really like to read more about Androl/Pevara, I really liked their scenes), Rand's wanderings and the more on how the love quadrangle works out, Mat and the Seanchan, etc etc.  So disappointed at the lackluster wrap up.<br /><br />There are several points in the story one could comment on, but most reviewers already cover most plot gripes I can think of but there is one that sticks in my head..  not a major spoiler coming up, but just warning, it is a spoiler...<br /><br />..when Androl and crew are undercover and he talks to Taim, Taim weaves a Mirror of Mists to make Androl look like himself he orders him to go back to the battle and go after Logain.  I'd think that neither Taim nor any of his cronies would find it odd since he was just ordered to leave if he stepped back then wove a gateway.  He could then just open a large one in the room horizontally at chest level and slice all of them in half.  *shrug*
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love the writing so eloquent, deep, poetic.....transfers u into another world full of magic....romance....Destiny....twists & turns....unpredictable...ready for the next one!

B001FW58D6|5.0|I love this show. Im only on Season 1 and it has captivated me fully. Each episode takes a scientific theory and expands and links them together.
B00BNR6RCE|3.0|For what they charged for this you would think you get a nice gatefold cover & some inserts of some kind.Nope<br /><br />Still love the Bob.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We have loads of fun with this one.  My kids love it and just like where's my water Disney's apps are fun for hours.  Worth the money spent.  We love Perry and Dr. D.
B001I10ABE|1.0|this album sucks! this began the death of the once mighty metallica! radio friendly garbage! enter sandman has to be one of the worst songs ever written! metallica at one time were amazing, they fought for thrash and were so damn good live with cliff burton! i shed a tear for those days, if youre a true headbanger ignore this crap!!!!!!!
0920668372|3.0|Wished I had read the entire book before purchase, not something I want to introduce to a young one who has lost someone
B00AEFY5TI|4.0|I bought this for my granddaughter because it's one of her favorites.  We enjoyed watching it together.  She sang all the songs.
B006LSZECO|3.0|LOVE the twist but hate the ending.  Nothing was  finalized it all just came to an end. Worth the read.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Very good app and I use it every day. Does what it says it will do. Have not found a better nightstand free app.
1451695195|2.0|The prose is boring and repetitive ad nauseum.  The doc doesn't make a convincing case.  His whole theory rests on the supposed \\"fact\\" that his cerebral cortex was non-functional.  Supposedly the E.Coli had destroyed his cerebral cortex.  If they destroyed the cerebral cortex, it would have remained destroyed.  There is no proof of this, only his conclusion.  Could there be proof?  Yes.  He never mentions whether or not he had an EEG.  An EEG would have decided the matter but either he never had one, which is hard to understand or he left it out of his narrative, which is also hard to understand.  His docs concluded that he was brain dead; how? By clinical exam alone?  There's something missing in his treatment, his evaluation and certainly his conclusions.  But it makes a nice, if fanciful story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is fun to play and the grandkids just love it as well.  We have Temple Run 1 as well.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Rent is a very good movie and I could follow the store line alot better then in other movies i have told everyone and they want to buy or take mind movie

B007BVMVDU|4.0|Excellent production and story line.  Too much sex, nudity, gayness!  This would have been five star without all of the explicit sexuality.
0306812835|3.0|Hard to follow in some places but seems like an alright book to accompany a college level course. Give you many opportunities to practice concepts though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very surprising and exciting! I'm impressed with the intensity of the relationship between this couple!<br />Also it is very inspiring just let things go...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters, the plot twists, and the story. It's a trilogy about love and loss. What a great read. Very engaging right up to the end!
B000JIHP88|5.0|I love this thing!!!! It allows me to eat breakfast every morning, keeps my little girl very occupied for 20-30 min. Then when she's tired she falls asleep below it with the rainforest noise. This is by far her favorite toy we own. It's totally worth the money if you are looking for something to keep your child busy so you can get stuff done!!!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is a genius. This little book can be read in one sitting . . . but it is packed with story, intrigue, and intensity. A very satisfying read.
B0000028M7|5.0|Most metalheads hate grunge, along with the bands Alice In Chains, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. Well here is one who repects all genres, and I can tell when something is special. Alice In Chains broke down the walls of their genre with this 1992 release, Dirt. Sadly, this came out two years before I was born so I couldn't hear this album in its prime, but I'm proud to say I have bought this album three times (1, scratched all to hell 2,I think I lost it. 3,In my truck right now) Anyway Dirt is a total hard rock/heavy metal/grunge (whatever you classify your music by) masterpiece. \\"Them Bones\\" up beat, heavy, and starts off with Layne going, \\"AHH!\\" One of the most known songs from the band actually. The solo is one of the best off the album. A great track to punch you in the face and forcefully say \\"Hey...you are going to enjoy this, hands down\\" \\"Dam That River\\" A nice riff starts off the second song. While not as heavy as the previous song, the chorus is catchy and it is an enjoyable song to speed to (haha) \\"Rain When I Die\\" intro to sorrow and depression. The bass sets the tone for this amazing song. One of my favorites from Alice In Chains. You will be singing along to this, \\"Is she ready to know my frustration...What's she slipping inside, love castration?\\" Those are genius lyrics. \\"Down In A Hole\\" while the previous track was an intro to depression and sadness...this song is depression, sadness, and sorrow 101. A hauntingly beautiful track. The lyrics are great and symbolic, it allows the listener to paint a different picture in their mind compared to someone else. One of their best songs. \\"Sickman\\" A nice drum beat sets the tone. While some people don't like the vocal showing, I like it. The change of tempo is great, and goes back to insanity, sorrow. \\"Rooster\\" The greatest song of all time. You haven't heard it? LISTEN!! \\"Junkhead\\" Another classic song. About a guy addicted to drugs. Done in classic Layne Staley fashion. \\"Dirt\\" The title track, one of the most simple yet catchy riffs in history. A great song, although it has a slow pace, it still retains the heavy guitars, and the drumming keeps pace. \\"God Smack\\" it took forever for this track to grow on me. I hated the vocals, but the chorus was awesome. It is now one of my favorite tracks. The riff is good. \\"Intro\\" you can tell what this does brings us to \\"Hate To Feel\\" Strange vocals are in this track, but they are incredibly unique. The gang chorus adds a sense of dread. \\"Angry Chair\\" a great opening brings you to a heavy metal gold mine. The chorus is great, and the vocals give a sense of impending dread. One of their best songs. \\"Would\\" Okay...this is one of the best songs of all time. Classic bass line brings us to the main part. Simple riffs, simple drumming, crazy vocals. Layne manages to combine the sorrow from the prevoius tracks, with the upbeat yells from the earlier tracks as well. \\"Would\\" is the prefect song to describe this album. It uses all of the elements previously stated.<br /><br />Overall, Dirt is a great album and a classic in the grunge era. Of all the grunge bands, Alice In Chains was the only one I actually liked. This album proves they were at the top of their game for the time being. This is a must have no matter what genre of music you prefer.mple yet catchy riffs in history.

B00BSBY38A|5.0|After the spectacular choices on the menu of 2012-13 Oscar movies, Life of Pi got pushed down the list of movies for me to see. I ended up waiting until its release, and I rented it from Amazon Instant.<br /><br />After experiencing this in HD, it instantly became one of my favorites of the movie year. I would put this only behind Lincoln. This movies shows that a director can take the new high tech 3D tools of modern movie-making and craft an incredbile story. A story that does not rely on these new tools to make it an incredible movie, but one that tells a story that is only made more vivid and breathtaking by the use of said tools.<br /><br />Not only do you leave this movie in awe of the visuals, but you leave it with a sense of mystery that lies at the heart of the movie. One that a viewer needs to experience to understand.There is an incredible mystery threaded through the movie, and one that comes to an interesting culmination in the end. This movie left me completely in agreement with the choice of Ang Lee as Best Director.<br /><br />Please watch this movie before making an appraisal of this past year in movies.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Wonderful. Could not put this entire series down. I would highly recommend it for readers of all ages. Great read.
B008P9M614|5.0|Purchased this for my boyfriend and he loves it. We have watched up to season 4 together at night, two or three episodes at a time. Great picture.
B004TI5N38|5.0|For me the suspense builds to a fever pitch; great read.  The horror and devastation to the environment and human life is put out there for us not to deny.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is incredibly well written, well directed and the acting is top tier.  The subplots within the show are unpredictable and always leave you wanting more.  I cannot wait until season four.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I kept reading in the hope that it would get better, but sadly it didn't. The jokes were sparse and predictable. She tried to make you feel like she is an unattractive, overworked, average run of the mill mother when instead she is a wealthy, famous, successful Hollywood star. Very disappointing.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I did this workout for about 2 weeks and it ended up in two trips to the ER due to a sprained calf muscle, swollen knee and ankle.  Will never do this workout again.  I would rather spend 45 minutes working out with proper form as opposed to being rushed through 30 and getting hurt.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|Getting the CD, the DVD and Live recording in one package? Great value on great music.  Live recording well done.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series was recommended to us by some friends, after a few episodes we are now hooked. We dont have cable so thanks amazon for letting us purchase episodes through you.
0920668372|1.0|I literally had tears streaming down my face from trying to contain my laughter while reading this book to my son for the first time.  Spoiler alert.  The mom in this book drives to her grown sons house in the middle of the night with a ladder strapped to her car, climbs in the window and pulls him out of bed to rock him.  I've never read anything so funny that was meant to be serious.  There are much better books out there to choose from to express a mothers undying love for their child.  Pass this one over and keep looking.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Thank you for the dream. This was a new refreshing kind of story. I love the way it's taken place in the past. I wish I could have been there in time.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|I haven't bought a Depeche Mode album in decades but purchased this album so that I could have advance purchase privilege with respect to tickets on their concert tour in support of the album. I am pleased with the music. It is classic Depeche Mode in a classical / bluesy way.
B00AIJP9BS|5.0|works perfectly on my tegra 3 device, cool game, its hard to score, not really action packed but basic and fun when your bored maybe they can add some power ups and specials you can grab during the game play, like invisible ball or exploding ball or blue balls (team cant score) and add a roof so we can richeochette the ball off the top instead of out of bounds but make the roof see through when viewing from the top angle ect..........and let this power up idea become a arcade game style selection in the menu.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I'm 75% thru the book and there really has Not been enough of the trademark Jack Reacher Action,fight scenes, etc. Plot is so,so..I hope it picks up here soon. I do like Lee Child's writing style and have bought and read almost all of his books. This one could be better though.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Enough said right.  Three great games in one box oh wait lets throw in three more for good measure at a low price.  Just get it to complete your collection already.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Picked this up for free, but would pay for it if I hadn't. Great gameplay without having to do much before playing and enjoying some old school space invaders fun.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|As a smallville follower and lover of DC comics this was a gift to fans in my opinion.  All of the characters are well developed as well as the story. So far so good!  Hopefully they can keep their streak going for season 2
B008G12EUY|5.0|Muse 2nd Law Limited Edition CD & DVD is so Great!!! I Love all the songs on the CD!!! My favorite song is Madness!!! I could listen to that song over & over!!! You will Love it to!!! Highly Recommended :)
B00B8SSWSK|4.0|True sound trek with an electro/blues bass throughout.  Love the vocals and crispy synth.  I waited with near fanatical anticipation for this release and now that I've heard each track (including bonus)  at least 20 times, I can honestly say it's my favorite album since Ultra.  It's about 3 songs long  (in the middle) the a b-side track Long Time Lie should have made the album.
0785152458|5.0|If you liked the first one you will love it.  If you didn't like the first one... Whats wrong with you?
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|So, I was skeptical with getting such a cheap mouse,  but after using it, wow. It puts my old G5 that I loved to shame. Seriously, if you are ok with wired mice for gaming, I can't think of anything that cones close for the price. Incredibly smooth motion instantly boosted my KDR online. The mouse also looks great, and the software lets you change the anker logo color to any color you want. Mine perfectly matches my keyboard for my Samsung series 7 gamer. If I could complain about anything, I would say that even with all of the weights installed, it's still a little light. But, that's not really a huge problem when I'm dominating online opponents. Also, this was at my house the next day through normal prime delivery.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|It's nice to know that some of the songs from CDs that I ordered are on it, and I didn't even download them there. So that was a very nice surprise. I downloaded this app on my Android phone, my tablet, and my PC. So I can listen to my music anywhere I go, as long as I have one of the three devices
B008602KQI|5.0|It is a great show to teach kids just how hard choices can be in life even for a child.
B00608HMFW|1.0|this was a 6 season package brand new but from season 3-6 every cd froze/skipped/broke up only 2-3 shows per cd would work.  So basiclly couldn't watch over 1/2 of those seasons.  By the time got to season 3 where they froze, my 30 days was up.  was a real bummer..

B006M7JCC2|4.0|I devoured this book because it describes the beauty she experienced and chronicles her unbelievable journey back to health from the brink of death.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Im a JT fan, and have been for a while. I had such high expectations for &#34;The 20/20 Experience,&#34; but I was greatly disappointed. The average song length is something like 7 minutes. Its insanely long, and borders on rambling.While listening through, you cannot discern which song is which, but rather its seems to bleed together into one long, confusing stream of consciousness. This album is garbage!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Describes a rough world, unusual circumstances, fierce combatants, deception here, honor there.  Good read but can be graphic and tragic.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I hadn't heard much by this Emeli Sande, but what i had heard, I loved. So i decided to give her album a try, and I am very glad I did. The songs are very vivid and are beautifully sung. Well done, Ms. Sande, well done.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I had a hard time getting into it and have not finished it.  May get back to it.  May not
B006YXTRHY|1.0|I highly recommend not watching this. They first couple of films did a great job of romanticizing vampires... but this one gets into the gross details. I didn't eat for a week!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great story line.  Not to hard but not too easy.  I like that it had a creepy effect to the theme.
B00A83075M|5.0|I took my 10 year old grandson to see this in the theatre and bought it for him when it was released.  It is a feel good movie that will make you smile.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|This album could have been named Sounds of the Universe II  It sounds just their previous record. Disappointing if you like their older material. I just wish this is the last album produced by Ben Hilier.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It was fun at first,  but it wouldn't let me type. It made the words type in slowly.  I like getting it over with,  this frozen a lot.  So I got facebook pro for $1.99 and that frozen to. Their both slow, don't spend your money.  It really ain't worth it.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|As always kindle book download very fast and are always easy to read.I love patrick rothfuss books and cant wait for the third instalment of this trilogy!
1603427244|5.0|Extremely informative and valuable little book packed full of good, essential information for every level of knitter. Very pleased with it, the condition, the delivery and the price. Thank you.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|this part was great. discs in good shape. wife loves movie and has watched it a few thousand times. can't wait for part two.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the Rope: Time Travel is great. Not sure about the historical accuracy, but I am a sucker for a time travel story.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|excellent product. I can open and edit all my file office until they are protected or encrypted. I highly recommend it
B009NG1Q96|4.0|The Elite was a great book. It picked right up where the selection left off. It took me on an emotional roller coaster! I laughed and cried. There were also some great twists, but in the end, I totally called what would happen. The one thing I didn't like was how this book turned into a love triangle. Aspen or Maxon? Aspen or Maxon? America was really torn! She went back and forth CONSTANTLY! That was frustrating as a reader. I also loved how the Selection became more of a competition. There were some other little things, but nothing that made me lower my rating. Overall The Elite was definitely darker and more mature than the Selection. Overall though this book was lovely and will defiantly worth the time and money!
B000MD9UJC|1.0|Didn't work.  Didn't work.  What else can I say?  I tried it on two separate AA Mag-Lites.  Lest you think me an idiot, I have an engineering degree.  So yeah, it doesn't work.
B005O7PXNS|1.0|The streaming was so riddled with stops, start agains and other failures that I bought the DVDs instead. Will not try Amazon streaming again.
030758836X|3.0|3 stars for keeping me glued to the pages for about 75% of the book. You want to, no wait, you just HAVE to know what happens so you keep reading. (and I think this is why the reviews for this book are so skewed)<br />For me - there was a point for which the story turns and when that happens the book goes from I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS to WILL THIS BOOK EVER END because I do not care about it anymore!??<br />I wish the author would have gone a different route with the end of the story. It left me feeling bored and annoyed.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|An excellent film recount of Cervantes' epic novel of the war between catholics and moors. How &#34;El Cid Campeador&#34; was instrumental in winning the war even after dying in battle and galloping into the sunset.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|A very dark movie where a troubled teen is haunted by a huge (ugly)  bunny. The track by Gary Jules (mad world) has to be replayed and absorbed by the viewer as a classic. A great addition to a movie lovers collection.
0316044695|5.0|It is hard to pick between American Sniper and this book so i will rate them #1 & #2 you decide for yourself.
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie and the book are both great.  I wish they would have Katniss show a little more emotion and explain a little more of the back story, but is good.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|This is Canadian crooner Michael Buble's 7th studio album release titled 'To Be Loved'. The album (14 tracks) has great 4 new original tracks co-written by Michael Buble' himself with collaborators and 10 classic covers (his own classical interpretation of the songs and the overall sound/feel of the album is that of a wonderful and very entertaining classical orchestral sound), making it a very enjoyable CD indeed. It's certainly one of his best in my book. Originals (4 tracks) are \\"After All\\" composed by Michael Buble'(MB), Bryan Adams, Alan Chang, Steven Sater and the legendary producer Jim Vallance (it's a rocky/poppy up-tempo track featuring Canadian rock singer-songwriter Bryan Adams); \\"Got It Easy\\" composed by MB, Tom Jackson & Alan Chang (this is my favourite track from the 4 originals, has a wonderful melody & vocals); \\"Close Your Eyes\\" composed by MB, Alan Chang & Jann Arden Richards and \\"It's A Beautiful Day\\" composed by MB, Amy Foster-Gillies and Alan Chang (it's a great first single from this album).<br /><br />The other 10 tracks are classic covers, namely the Bee Gees' \\"To Love Somebody\\", it's my favourite from the covers; Dean Martin's \\"Nevertheless (I'm In Love With You)\\" (a jazzy track that features the wonderful The Puppini Sisters); Miracles' \\"Who's Lovin' You\\", Jackie Wilson's \\"To Be Loved\\" (this is a great title track composed by the legendary Motown mogul/composer Berry Gordy Jnr); Elvis Presley's \\"Have I Told You Lately\\" (it's composed by Scotty Wiseman); \\"Young At Heart\\" composed by Johnny Richards and Carolyn Leigh; Randy Newman's \\"You've Got A Friend In Me\\"; \\"Come Dance With Me\\" composed by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn; \\"Something Stupid\\" composed by Clarence Carson Parks (the song feafures actress Reese Witherspoon on vocals) and the wonderful \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\" composed by Mark Gordon & Josef Myrow and sung by Frank Sinatra.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are \\"To Love Somebody\\" & \\"I Got It Easy\\". The remaining 12 tracks are good joyful and entertaining orchestral based tracks. There are no weak tracks or CD fillers.<br /><br />On overall, Michael Buble' is on the roll in this new CD release 'To Be Loved', I love it to bits. A highly recommended CD for your listeling pleasure.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I love this CD.  If you love Luke Bryan then give it a try.  Lots of songs on it I had not heard before but hope he will sing them in his concerts this summer.
B00BHXUC8E|4.0|This is a live double CD release by British heavy metal band Whitesnake titled 'Made In Japan'. The double CD (20 tracks) was recorded live in Tokyo, Japan in 2011: the band plays well, good quality sound and production.<br /><br />Disc 1 (12 tracks): Stand-out tracks/gems/my favourite performances are \\"Love Ain't No Stranger\\" (wonderful melody/vocals and the fans go bullistic during the performance of this song) & my all time Whitesnake favourite song \\"Here I Go Again\\". Who can forget great guitar works in \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" & \\"Six String Showdown\\". There are 2 only okay tracks in \\"Drum Solo\\" & \\"Still Of The Night\\", the remaining 8 tracks are good entertaining tracks. This is my favourite disc of the two.<br /><br />Disc 2 (8 tracks): Stand-out track/gem/favourite track is \\"Fare Thee Well (Acoustic version)\\" : great guitar chords and melody. This disc is more laid-back compared to the first disc as it's predominately acoustic (I really like acoustic arrangements by heavy metal or alternative rock bands). The remaining 7 tracks are great live performances with no weak track.<br /><br />On overall, Whitesnake did set Tokyo on fire in 2011 with a great live performance. A recommended CD listening.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so darn cool all your kids will love it the game is just awesome I think it is totally worth the sweet small data space and on top of this it  is freeeeeeeeeeee!!!
B00AIJP9BS|2.0|Today's free app of the day is Get the Egg: Foosball PRO.<br /><br />Let me start off with the positives:<br /><br />1. A new app developer that hasn't had a free app of the day before.<br />2. The game is playable.<br />3. Can be played as a 1 or 2 player game.<br />4. Game is not overpriced at 99 cents.<br />5. Game does have the ability to play with multiple balls at the same time through power-up boxes.<br /><br />Now the negatives:<br /><br />1. This is not as fun as a real Foosball table game like you would find at your local YMCA.<br />2. Game becomes somewhat repetitive and boring after just a short period of time.<br />3. Game's storyline seems to have little relevance to the game of Foosball.<br />4. Gift box option in menu is not explained so I have no idea what that is for.<br />5. No way to select an easy or difficult computer opponent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the negatives for me outweigh the positives.  I felt the computer opponent to be frustrating to play against at times since it seemed to wait a little while before moving the ball. In one game I played the computer goalie opponent seemed to be frozen in one place making it much easier to score in that particular game.<br /><br />Mainly because of the rather quick loss of interest in playing this game and the lack of a skill setting for the computer opponent, I am giving this game app a 2 star out of 5 star rating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think that is a good book for young adults and teens. But I think that only children ten and up should read these books for the harsh things that is has example: killing, naked, ext. But I do believe ( in my opinion) that this book series should be on the summer reading list for middle school. May the Odds be Ever in Your Favor.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it works, even if I really don't want it to.  ;)  There are mornings I just don't want to get up.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Beautifully written, the story transports you to the dark ages, giving insights into the lives of extraordinary people and, contrary to preconceived ideas for that era, making them appear vibrant, colorful, leading thrilling lives, while, at the same time, having to contend with the plague, thus exposing the human psyche in its darkest and most brilliant manifestations. Despite the book's size, it is easy to keep track of the characters, the patterns of their lives woven together masterfully by Follett in a most plausible manner for such extraordinary deeds.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Love the DVD and delivery was prompt... thanks We will enjoy this video for years to come as we went to the now closed broadway play so now can listen anytime
B000FC2ROU|5.0|This book is a must read for anybody who likes a story with an element(s) of the supernatural.  It is also extremely well crafted, with vibrant, dynamic characters and a solid ending.  I would recommend this book to anybody.
B0033QC0WE|5.0|It is hours of music in the background as I prepare lessons and sermons. It is as well a time to close your eyes and just let the music caress and inspire you. I have copied it to both my computers so it is always close by.<br /><br />I am obviously a happy customer. I believe if you like classical music, Beethoven: the Symphonies make you a happy customer as well. [M. Lane].
0307476073|1.0|Yuck. I should have known, people finding themselves is irritating . This gal is sex obsessed, self pitying and just plain hard to like. Even the trail part was mostly boring. She wasn't so much tough and brave as just plain lucky.  Glad I didn't pay for this.
B002P79KAC|5.0|I am so happy that I can simply purchase episodes of this show on my Kindle Fire wherever I go. Purchasing this item was extremely easy and was as much fun watching it at home. I haven't been able to see a lot of the older episodes, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw all of the seasons. Terrific show!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this game but I am unable to use it on my iphone.  It works great on my kindle.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like the app it is a basic weather app and shows weather trends for your area no more no less
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just like temple run. Exsept there is a cop chaseing you.<br />Awesome and additing<br />Must get now!!!!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire battery did not seem to hold the charge with my old charger, so I contacted Amazon and they recommended the newer charger.  I'm so glad I received this because it works wonderfully.  The battery is back to holding its charge the way it did when I first purchased it.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This is a great camp knife , I've batoned  with it , started fires, cut tree limbs and even skinned with it ,<br />The blade hold up great and can really take a beating , great for anyone looking  for a dependable knife and a great price
B004YCKK46|5.0|My husband watches this movie over and over.  I find it stressful.  He made me purchase it for him. Hmmmm.
1452115567|5.0|For now, Maddie is on my coffee table. The perfect coffee table dog! I love seeing all the zany places she winds up in! And her facial  expressions are PRICELESS. I've been following her (and Theron) on Instagram for a while, and was really jazzed about the book. Can't wait for the sequel! :)
B001QB5S3G|5.0|great movie.  great plot and history.  its an incredible movie about the heroic efforts of a few Jesuits, and one renegade (De Niro).
