B00005V3Z4|5.0|I don't usually write reviews to movies, but this one is different. I just watched this stunning masterpiece for the first and certainly not last time. The stunning visual art and the music of this movie take one into a different world, a disturbingly different world. Borderline crazyness seems to be logic, everything is turned upside down and at the end of this imaginitiv and utterly unique movie, one is left questioning what one just saw. One is left without understanding but moved in every way by a movie experience, that goes far beyond what can be seen in other movies. It will be neccessary to watch this movie several times, to even just scratch the surface of what this movie is all about. It will be worth it.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|This movie has stood the test of time.   Gritty closeups are the hallmark.  Starts slow, but gathers attention and interest.  I expect this is how the West really was during the \\"cowboy\\" era.  Highly recommended.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I remember watching this show religiously every week. No other Trek show got that from me. All of the others I just watched the first episodes out of curriousity. This is the most real, down to earth, home-hitting Star Trek there has every been. I only wish it had been allowed to further bloom with additional seasons. Too bad UPN moved to the \\"Hood\\".
0385339100|5.0|A great lawyer is meticulous, calculating, aggressive, relentless, and prepared for anything. John Grisham lovingly shares an intricate plot to provide you with an unforgettable portrait of those qualities in action. In the process, you'll also see a man whose soul is offended by his profession.<br /><br />Ultimately, this book is about a dream . . . a dream that may be more dangerous than an addictive drug. What will you do to capture your dream? That's what you'll be asking yourself after you read The Partner.<br /><br />The beginning of the book seems like an international espionage thriller.  A group of private detectives track down a fugitive to a little town in Brazil near the border with Paraguay. They pounce, and the fugitive is in for his worst nightmare . . . remorseless torture aimed at getting him to tell something he doesn't know.<br /><br />Soon, an unlikely intervention creates a whole new vector for the story. The fugitive has to face the music from a lot of angry lawyers . . . including his former partners.<br /><br />Like many legal thrillers, you'll be getting no more information than you need to know to follow the action. Pay attention to the questions that occur to you: Thinking about what might have happened is half the fun of this book.<br /><br />If you aren't interested in the ins and outs of how lawyers think about criminal issues, you won't like this book as much as I did. I was impressed at how well the legal issues were displayed without being too technical. Remember that lawyers usually spend a lot of time thinking through how the opposing attorney will respond to various probes.<br /><br />Watch out for the unexpected!
B0014BQQYS|1.0|I am sorry to say this is one of the worst Blu-ray disc I have seen, and I own about hundred of Blu-ray discs since its inception. Actually I have forgotten how the original DVD version looks liked, so I took it out for comparison, and yes, the Blu-ray version does look a little bit better, but overall the picture quality is still so dreadful, it seems you are watching the movie through a muddy window: colour is dull, contrast is low, and the image is blur.    If the studio can't make an aged movie look decent, then they better don't release it in the high definition format, as there are so many other good, classic movies waiting to be re-mastered.    The audio also improves a bit, but still don't expect much from it.
1416550518|5.0|A tremendously atmospheric, well-written return to the times of Upstairs Downstairs.  This book, by a heretofore unknown (in the USA) Australian writer, is set in England around World War 1, and absolutely deserves to be an international bestseller. Run, don't walk, to buy it and enjoy it.
075640407X|5.0|I picked this up on a whim and my only disappointment is that the sequel is so far away. This is quite possibly the best new author I have found in the last ten years. I read a lot of science fiction and there hasn't been anything to rival this in a very long time. Forget George RR Martin or Robert Jordan and spend your money here.
0930289455|5.0|this is, by far, one of the best comic book I've ever read, hands down. the story picks up with Batman going to visit the Joker, in an attempt to smooth things over and end this constant cycle of fights they have had over the years before one of them gets killed, when Batman discoverers that the Joker has escaped and left an impostor in his stead, the story begins, and in this book you truly see the Joker as the great villain he truly is, from the horrific act of violence he performed by shooting Barbra Gordon and then stripping her nude just  to show photos of it to her father (Commissioner Gordon) after he has been captured,to the truly sympathetic and yet unclear back story it gives the character, while also keeping it true to the dark crime comics that Batman is, it is ranked VERY high on my list of best comic books ever, at least in the top 3, and any fan of comics in general should pick this one up, even if you don't know the extensive history these characters (Batman and the Joker) you can still get into it since their two very recognizable icons, but this book gets very personal with both the characters in that even though they are sworn enemies, they are also best friends who have to fight each other because they are on two sides of one spectrum, and it also shows how similar they are, they are both freaks, one good freak, and one bad freak, but both the same in so many ways, this book is the vest telling of the Joker for who he really is, and the relationship he shares with batman, and how deep it really is, and is recommended to the highest degree, if you love comics, or even if you don't READ THIS BOOK, it's amazing, 5 stars
B000VS6R26|5.0|I remember seeing this film in the theatre as a young teenager and being fascinated by the event. Not only is the film itself massive but the history the film is based on involves the most infamous ship wreck in history. James Cameron defenitley shows his prowess as a director with this film the camera moves and the angles he uses during the sinking are unconventional and in my opinion he deserved the oscar that he got for the film. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet have both matured as performers since this film but they were both believable and had a great on screen chemistry. I think that this is a great epic film and needs to be seen by everyone so that the legacy of the Titanic will never be lost.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|i watched this movie when it was on tv the first time and like it alot . the only part i didn't like was when one of my favorite stars was hung. oh well that's all part of the story. i'm hopping to own all of this set some day
B0012E6R3W|4.0|Being the first Testament album in nearly a decade, The Formation of Damnation was definitely among the most anticipated releases of 2008, and despite some minor flaws, it does not disappoint.<br /><br />Complete with the original lineup plus Paul Bostaph on drums, this album is certainly a solid piece of work, but saying it's one of their best would be an exaggeration. Sure, the mighty Alex Skolnick is back, and he lays down the mesmerizing guitar work fans have always expected from him. Skolnick is in great form -- from the shred-intensive fretwork of \\"Killing Season\\", which also stands out for his intricate arrangement, to the heavy-duty riffing of the title track, he maintains his melodic signature without diluting the overall flow of the record. The latter actually preserves the powerful death metal influences of the band's songs on The Gathering, as vocalist Chuck Billy delivers his killer low register vocals. And the lead guitar solo here is brilliant to say the least.<br /><br />Though this is not one of those horrible groove-oriented discs with the occasional thrash riffing, the majority of the tracks move in a safe midtempo pattern, best noticed on the slightly modern-sounding \\"Dangers of the Faithless\\", interspersed with some processed vocals and a The Ritual-like guitar solo running through the piece secretly. To balance it out, however, the band bring forth tracks like \\"Henchmen Ride\\" and \\"F.E.A.R.\\", the former noteworthy for its jackhammer riffing and big chorus, and the latter, written entirely by Alex Skolnick, for its modern vibe injected into its fierce, relentless onslaught of twin guitar attacks.<br /><br />Vocalist Chuck Billy employs more of his clean singing this time around, but he hasn't abandoned his snarling vocals completely. On the 9/11-inspired \\"The Evil Has Landed\\", for instance, he exudes his brutal singing and Paul Bostaph's drumming here is simply amazing. Without getting into the Bostaph-Lombardo comparisons, I feel Bostaph more than serves the purpose of the album, though some tunes could have benefited more from his imaginative fills and attacks.<br /><br />Mainstay Eric Peterson still produces powerful rhyhthm work throughout the album, but honestly, he has written a lot more engaging riffs before. On some tunes, whether he opted for thrash metal or just midtempo melodic lines with some aggressive parts mixed in remains unanswered. While The Gathering detained a wholeness from start to finish, full of dark and brutal thrash metal onslaughts, The Formation of Damnation branches off into more diversified territory, merging a plethora of Testament trademarks from way back.<br /><br />The album deals with a variety of topics lyrically. The last song \\"Leave Me Alone\\" is about divorce, and one of the few tracks that sees bassist Greg Christian straying from the norm and offering some of his powerful and varied playing. It's somewhat disappointing  that he primarily sticks to root notes only on this disc, which is saying a lot considering how great a player he truly is. With the exception of a handful tunes, the bass is almost inaudible, though he does come to the fore on the album's first single \\"More Than Meets the Eye\\", with a galloping bass line, albeit with little variation. \\"Afterlife\\", as its title suggests, is about the loss of a loved one, but one might feel the sing-along chorus could have been less emphasized, given its searing rhythm guitar.<br /><br />Bottom line, the album is definitely worth checking out and a great addition to Testament's catalog. It is not one of their best, but it's not a disappointment either. Many have compared it to albums like Practice What You Preach and The New Order, and while I can see where they're coming from, writing-wise it also touches a great deal on The Gathering mixed up with modern studio trickery in places.<br /><br />Andy Sneap has done a great job on mixing the album, giving it its much deserved sonic punch. The sound is wide with a full magnitude and does not take away from thrash metal's visceral roots.eral roots.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|this is a great soundtrack. It has every song from the movie done by the cast of the movie. love it!!!!
B0009QTS1M|5.0|I am fascinated by the history of the Roman Empire. That being said I think that Ridley Scott is a genius and that this is by far his best film. In scope alone it leaves an impression. Everything else about this film is perfect from the sets and costumes to the academy award winning performance that Russell Crowe gave as Maximus. This film asks questions that we as a society face every day the questions of right and wrong and what happens after you die. Overall this film is one of my favorites and definitley worth watching. This DVD is loaded with making of documentaries and has a commentary on the extended cut of the film definitley worth a buy!!
0670018651|5.0|I got an e-mail from Amazon (not that it's personal) to write a review of this book.  After looking over the others, I don't really see what I can add, but here's my four cents:<br /><br />1. It's a bit sad to me that folks are so insecure.  So what if Turin and Sachez have a different opinion than you?  I have heard people say they were devastated that The Guide doesn't say \\"their scent\\" is great.  It doesn't say some of my favorites are either, and I could care less.<br /><br />2. Why is everyone saying it's bitchy?  Yes, it's scathing, but it's not bitchy.  There's a world of difference.  Turin and Sanchez love scent and this comes through.  They are having fun, I would imagine.  And what do we do when we're having fun?  Make jokes.  Overstate.  No, it's not bitchy, for it's never mean just for the sake of it.<br /><br />3. These folks are professionals in their field.  Dr. Turin designs new scent molecules.  It is no wonder that they both go for the unusual and even the unwearable.  The vast majority of the mid-scale department store scents smell the same: how would you like it if you had to test these on a regular basis?  I'm sure your taste, too, would become more refined and gravitate to more bang than, say, yet another quiet white floral.<br /><br />4.  Folks, have some faith in your own opinions and just enjoy.  The bottom line is this: this book is a great deal of fun.  If you're looking for a list of ingrediants, google it.
0525950079|2.0|I think I must have read every Ken Follett book now, so, yes, I'm a fan. WWE is one of his weakest. The plot limps along with no discernible beginning or end, there are no cliffhangers that make it impossible to put the book away, no parallel plots that you can vaguely see converge into some horrible disaster in the future, no intricately woven plot strands (yes, yes, there's the buried letter that pops up in the beginning and then again in the end, but really, it doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the novel); WWO has a very small cast of very easily pegged characters, who at a higher than usual rate engage in very much off-the-shelf sex scenes. It's narrative is entirely linear, and plot twists nonexistent; in fact, sometimes you suspect the author simply forgot to pick up again some storyline that he planted earlier. None of that good stuff, in short, that made you love The Pillars of the Earth, Night Over Water, The Eye of the Needle, or The Third Twin.     Most troublesome of all, though, I think Follett lost the edge. He's become soft. The evil characters in this book are so unimaginative, so predictable, so... homespun, the book achieves an almost children's-book-like harmlessness. Maybe it's just hard to come up with truly shocking villains in this day and age of Dick Cheney and Karl Rove, but do you remember how, when reading, say, The Pillars of the Earth, you repeatedly caught yourself whispering to yourself `Oh no, he can't, he won't..., not that!!' and it would turn out twice as bad? Well, if that upset you a little too much, then WWE is for you.    So, if you're a Follett loyalist like me, yes, you will want to read it  but you might as well wait until it hits the shelf of your local library. If you haven't worked your way through his earlier books, treat yourself to those instead!
0471702188|5.0|I found this book to be a great read in learning about all the various aspects that go into the valuation of a company. It does a great job of making you look at what makes a company tick and how it affects a valuation.    The base of the book is the DCF (Discounted Cash Flows) model. It describes many of the formulas used. I am not a math major or anything so many of them were over my head. The authors did a good job of describing the formulas but if you don't have a good solid foundation it will take a while to break down the formulas.    I did come across many areas in the book that justifies any kind of forecasting is mediocre at best. It's not an exact science and any kind of model is just that - a model of a perfect world. The world is not perfect but perhaps a DCF model is the closest you'll get to being real in a perfect storm.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|As a fan of Ridley's this film was right up my alley and as I watched it I was not dissapointed. Of course it is not in the same league as The Godfather but in my opinion it is one of Ridley's most powerful and gripping film todate. The performances are brilliant and the direction is on par with Ridley's distinct visual style. It is defenitley worth watching. The 2-disc edition has some great documentaries about the real guys and the production of the film.
B000024QML|5.0|In 1993, gay music had hit a watershed point. Elton John had hit the charts with \\"The Last Song\\" (from [[ASIN:B0000089F2 The One]]), both kd lang ([[ASIN:B000002LSP Ing&eacute;nue]]) and Melissa Etheridge ([[ASIN:B000001G0U Yes I Am]]) were out of their closets, Bruce Springsteen stepped up to the plate and contributed the theme to [[ASIN:B0000029F1 Philadelphia: Music From The Motion Picture]] and even Garth Brooks, arguably the biggest music star in the world at the time, socked it to the homophobic country music establishment with his song \\"We Shall be Free.\\"<br /><br />In the middle of this was The Pet Shop Boys' \\"Very.\\" Shaking off the chill of [[ASIN:B000002UWL Behavior]] and the often guarded veil their music was often accused of, \\"Very\\" was as personal and as out an album as Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant had ever made. From the sneering, sinister opener \\"Can You For Forgive Her\\" to the subtle altering of the Village People's [[ASIN:B000001EK8 Go West]], this CD was out and danceable, as well as inspired. The music moved between optimistic (\\"Liberation\\") and melancholic (\\"Dreaming of The Queen\\"), striking a perfect balance throughout.<br /><br />Yet it was the blatantly open sexuality of the record that made it so triumphant. \\"Can You Forgive Her\\" goads a closet case for sticking with the undercover girlfriend who mocks his secret.<br /><br />\\"She's made you some kind of laughing stock<br />because you dance to disco and you don't like rock.<br />She made fun of you and even in your bed<br />said she's going to go and get herself a real man instead.\\"<br /><br />But instead of shying away from the consequence, they ask \\"do you want revenge?\\" Seems that coming out is the best revenge in the PSB playbook. From there, \\"Very\\" jumps to the openly giddy \\"I Wouldn't Normally do This Sort of Thing\\" and the affirming \\"Liberation.\\" As a 1-2-3 set of punches, it thoroughly sets the album up for greatness. A little later, they even take a poke at their own image on \\"Yesterday When I Was Mad,\\" plotting their tongue-in-cheek vengeance on all the folks who refused to recognize their brilliance.<br /><br />However, the thoughtfulness that washes through \\"Dreaming Of the Queen\\" echoes \\"Being Boring,\\" but in a more sorrowful way. Told in dream-like language, Neil addressed The Queen and Lady Diana over England's lack of response to the AIDS crisis.<br /><br />\\"The queen said 'I'm aghast<br />Love never seems to last.<br />However hard you try.'<br />And Di replied,<br />'That there are no more lovers left alive<br />No one has survived.'\\"<br /><br />Soon after is \\"The Theatre,\\" which is rich and textured in the manner of \\"It's a Sin\\" ([[ASIN:B00005J9LZ Actually]]) or \\"Left To My Own Devices\\" ([[ASIN:B000002UTK Introspective]]). Taking a theatrical approach to the class distinctions makes for a distinctive song, along with Anne Dudley's orchestration.<br /><br />The final stoke of genius, however, comes from a cover. Much in the way they reclaimed \\"Always On My Mind\\" from country or took the wind out of U2's \\"Where The Streets Have No Name,\\" Pet Shop Boy's fairly reverent version of \\"Go West\\" transforms the song entirely. When Village People recorded it in the 70's as an anthem to liberation and the freedom of San Francisco as an escape from mundane life in backwaters, it felt like a time of limitless possibility. Twelve years later, it struck a note of lost opportunities and the leveling effect of too many lost minds and stolen friends. Even with the bellowing He-Man chorus, there was no way to escape the subtext...that was then, this is now.<br /><br />As such, \\"Very\\" was the high-water mark of Chris and Neil's creative output. Granted, latter albums like [[ASIN:B000EZ8OHW Fundamental]] are still pretty good, but this was a moment captured.

006088732X|5.0|If you liked the movie, Mean Girls, then you will LOVE this book.  One of my students wrote a review on this that completely intrigued me.  Once I picked it up, she begged me NOT to read it - of course, this only added fuel to the literary fire.  Of course I read it. She has checked up on me to see 'where I'm at' and 'what page I'm on'.  Too funny - has the student become the teacher?    At any rate, this book is a thrilling page-turner that completely ticked me off at the end.  While Ali DeLaurentis is the 'beautiful girl' that the other girls would kill to be ... did one of them actually do it? When Ali disappears, she takes the other girls' secrets to the grave, or does she? When Hanna, Aria, Spencer and Emily begin receiving strange texts and emails that indicate that maybe the secrets aren't dead and buried, the girls become quite paranoid.  Sara Shepard does a brilliant job by tapping into the teen culture and hitting exactly what they are curious about, wondering, and wanting to experiment with.  I, as well as my girls, can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B0010VD7EO|3.0|I was intrigued by the sound clips of this album and I like the CD too. These guys have a sound that at times is blatantly disco, other times is like space rock and sometimes like 90s alt rock. One song, \\"Of Moons, Birds & Monsters\\", has a guitar solo reminiscent of Hendrix's solo in All Along The Watchtower. Overall I find the album pretty satisfying on repeated listening, although I doubt I'll be listening to it 4 months from now. It's easygoing and sometimes (the disco times) outright fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but isn't completely silly either. If you like the sound clips you'll probably like this CD just as much.
0312379293|1.0|Assuming that Lord Archer based part of this book on his own experience in Her Majesty's prisons, he surely got the rest from literary classics and old TV shows.    In the hierarchy of tales whose plots center on switched identities, the greatest by far is A Tale of Two Cities. After that we have The Prince and the Pauper, and perhaps after that The Parent Trap and the Patty Duke Show (\\"we are cousins, identical cousins\\"), and finally way down the list is Jeffrey Archer's A Prisoner of Birth.    It defies credulity that a Scottish peer and a wrongfully convicted  East End mechanic could be brought together in prison and  switch places. As a result the characters are cartoonish and the subplots either contrived or predicable.    Anything by John Mortimer is better than this.
B00154GEFU|3.0|I have followed ASIA awhile. I feel that ASIA without Steve Howe is not ASIA. I also feel that John Wetton is the ONLY voice of ASIA. I could not stand John Payne! So you can probably figure out by these statements that I was very happy when two years ago the original members got back together. That is the only true ASIA lineup!<br /><br />The problem with \\"Phoenix\\" is not the production or who they chose as a producer. It is not bad songwriting either or the artwork. The problem is a lot more simple then that. The way I see it,the songs are too mellow. It is OK to have a ballad to balance out the other songs but this CD has too many of them!!!! There are no great Steve Howe moments when you can say \\"WOW, that guitar\\" solo really grabs me\\"! If I wanted a CD that soft, I would have bought a Barry Manilow album!<br /><br />Let me ask a question to those of you that reviewed this CD and gave it 5 stars. Are you perhaps older?

Imagine having the fortitude to continue opposing it for 20+ years.<br /><br />I have to admit that two-thirds into the movie it got a little slow, but the ending was such a great inspiration.<br /><br />And let's be honest- we need to get rid of another dirty little secret in our society.  Sadly- the dirty secret I'm talking about props up an industry called sex.  The \\"secret\\" is abortion, and it has tens of thousands more victims than slavery- but the victims are unseen, unborn humans and the women who are forced to consider a \\"choice\\" of killing their own children.  If prejudice is the result of slavery, then broken homes and the destruction of the family is the result of abortion.<br /><br />We need brave leaders like Wilberforce and Pitt to stand up for purity.  If opponents of military intervention in the Middle East say, \\"No War for Oil,\\" then we need to say, \\"No murder for Sex!\\"

It offers ganauche, basic icing recipes that you can vary throughout the book: it's simple, organized, and straightforward. However, non-hydrogenated shortening and non-hydrogenated margerine are staples in the icing which is brilliant but I don't know where to find non-hydrogenated shortening. Otherwise there are no really specialty items to buy. It looks really good.. i haven't tried it yet. But there are just enough pictures... not on every single page like some other overpriced modern-looking cookbooks... but just enough to show the important stuff. I want to buy Veganomicon now.
B00008ADPF|5.0|Having heard the two most popular albums by Nickelback, SILVER SIDE UP and ALL THE RIGHT REASONS, I decided to buy this one as well because I knew a few of the songs on it and remembered that I didn't have this one yet. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but after listening to it a few times I decided this is their best album of the three that I've heard. It's the closest to perfect I've ever heard on a post-grunge album.    I thought SILVER SIDE UP was too heavy on the guitars and all of the songs sounded too similar, and I thought ALL THE RIGHT REASONS was a better album but sounded too forced for the mainstream. This album has the perfect balance of metal-influenced heavy rock and hook-filled choruses that would sound great on rock radio (a few of them proved they do). The reader is probably familiar with at least the song \\"Someday\\". That song and \\"Do This Anymore\\" are probably the most ballad-like, with lyrics focusing on broken relationships over soaring harmonies and great hooks in the chorus. Other songs are heavier, such as the barn-burning opener \\"Flat on the Floor\\", \\"Because of You\\", and the merciless guitar-riffer \\"Throw Yourself Away\\". What makes this album stand out from the aforementioned others is the consistency of this album; the band knows what they're doing and sounds like they're having fun doing it. Even on tracks like the acoustic-based \\"Should've Listened\\", which is a step in a different direction for the band, the quartet pulls it off perfectly.    Buy this album if you're a casual Nickelback fan like myself, and get a taste of this popular group at their best.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|Many would believe that it would either be a trivialization or too obvious to compare the series' of \\"Spider Man\\" and \\"The Evil Dead\\" together. The two series, both directed by Sam Raimi, do share some of the characteristics in style and design, while other points are a flip 180 degrees from Raimi's days as a blood-and-guts Grindhouse film maverick. This comparison is needed to understand, if not accept, what Raimi may have intended with this third Spidey entry, a film that is buoyed only by the character interaction of its central characters, all of which, have appeared in the last entries. The problem is, \\"Spiderman 3\\" does not seem to have anything more to say, and sadly backtracks its seriousness to corny, schlock humor and comic-book gimmicks that do not work on the big screen. This characterization dumb-down seems much more akin to the third Evil Dead movie, Army of Darkness-- yet, it is sadly more insulting than Evil Dead's descent into Three Stooges humor, as the first Spider Man film set up the series so it could emotionally develop and mature, unlike the intentional B-movie element of those splatter films.    Perhaps the blockbuster success of the first two \\"Spider Man\\" films went to the filmmaker's head, like Tobey Maguire as the characters of Spiderman and Peter Parker in this film. As in Spiderman 3, Peter Parker's alternate ego of Spiderman is still shrouded in mystery from everyone but his best friend and girlfriend, but Spider Man is a hero to the people of the New York City. Then, one day, Peter wakes up in a black suit that makes him stronger, but it also makes him slowly succumb to his flaws, whether it be his tragic past, or his dark side. Parker's girlfriend, Mary Jane ( Kristin Dunst) gets very upset with him, as he seems to put his alternate identity above her. When Peter gets more aggressive and cocky, both in and out of his suit, he begins to lose the grasp on who he really is, while he still must save the city from a villain known as The Sandman, and another entity who posses many of Spiderman's own powers.    See, back in the 1980's Raimi was a prodigy to horror film fans. Much like punk rock and its do-it-yourself ethos, Raimi and his friends made some of the funnest underground work of the era, and ushered in a wave of similar artists that wanted to follow suit. Flash forward to the Spiderman series and you have a similar craze of films that match the comic book craze, but unlike Evil Dead, this time they have a much bigger budget due to studio backing, and its cult is bigger due to using the actual Spider Man name, a staple of many comic-book reading youth for generations.  This might be the problem with Spider Man 3-- despite ever-growing gallant spectacle, it's the only film in this series that seems its solely for the comic book fans, because its generic, lacking depth, and feels too much like the bad cliché of comic books in which they are thought to be only one-dimensional and emotionally shoddy.    As \\"Spiderman 3\\" is a film that mostly only works as a summer blockbuster, and any other way is only because the earlier movies were quite good, and set up the reoccurring characters that have carried over into this film.  There is no new dimension added to this film, even for the new characters that sadly are only ciphers.  Raimi may try to add \\"some\\" depth to the Sandman, and the one emotional scene involving him and his daughter does work well, yet it only leaves the viewer wanting more. While Topher Grace's antagonistic character has a pretty bland personality and no real depth, and the cheesy jokes in the entire movie are rather irritating and dumbs the material down--as, do we really need the cheesy dancing and fight scene in a nightclub, or a quick shot of Parker dancing on the street after getting a new style of clothes--real laughs, however, come from the irresistible cameo of \\"Evil Dead's,\\" Bruce Campbell, as a hilarious ill-timed garcon.    One of the final blasphemies in the film is the way that the best parts of the Spider Man series was not the fights, but the emotion at its core involving its coming-of-age characters. With much dismay, in \\"Spider Man 3,\\" the tensions are more akin to soap-opera melodrama-- with themes that may match its good-vs.-evil struggle in the soul of mankind, but do not get into a proper examination, and does not let the characters properly develop. Instead the film makes half-baked statements that seem like a slogan for an after school special than a theme.      Though I doubt this will be the last of the series, as \\"Spider Man 3\\" does not feel like a good caper to two surprisingly solid  comic book adaptations and certainly missed out on the possibility of expanding on past entries. It did, however, seem to run on the fumes of those two films, making it more of a time killer, as it will probably never prove to be a grower.      *** (Out of 5)
B000TSUCAQ|5.0|My son is 4 and a huge Star Wars fan because of Lego Star Wars, so when I found this book, I was thrilled! We haven't done any of the recipes yet, because my son makes his daddy read it to him at night, but the recipes look really good and different rather than just an ordinary recipe with a fancy name attached. Some thought actually went into finding some unique recipes so it's a good cookbook as well as a fun book.

0061150142|5.0|This is a great story of love and loss.  You can't help but put yourself in the characters' shoes.  Did he do it, didn't he?  This is the Jodi Picoult we love.  If you've never read a book by this author, this is a great one to start with.  This book throws in some tough issues, but anyone who has any experience in life can definetely relate to one character or another.  Enjoy!
1416550518|5.0|This book tells the tragic story of a grand English family through the eyes and ears of one of their servants, Grace.  The book opens when Grace, age 98, is contacted by a woman who is in the process of making a movie that will depict the history of the House at Riverton.  Grace is asked to be a consultant on the movie based on her experiences with the family and the house.  While visiting the studio sets for the film, long hidden memories are awakened in Grace, who later decides she must record those memories for the benefit of her grandson, Marcus.    This story of the House at Riverton begins in 1914 when a 14 year-old Grace hires on as a servant girl in the house.  She soon meets the Hartford children, who are all about the same age as Grace, and she is immediately smitten with them.  All the children grow older as the country enters into WWI, which takes an immeasurable toll on the family.  As the Hartford girls go on to make their debut into society they wrestle with the new post-war attitudes and expectations of what it means to be a modern woman verses what has traditionally been a woman's role in society.  The entire Hartford family history leads up to a very mysterious, very public tragedy that gradually comes into focus as the story fleshes out.    In the book, Grace's memories of the Hartford family are interspersed with glimpses of Grace's life since her time in service to the Hartford family and her present day life as an elderly lady in a nursing facility.  The reader is drawn back and forth between the present and the past, constantly discovering little pieces of the puzzle, sometimes in the past and sometimes in the present; a convention that keeps the story fresh and alive throughout the book.  Ms. Morton has done a wonderful job not only of representing the early 20th century in both events and social attitudes, but also in creating a truly believable cast of characters with which to populate her creation.

B000001G5H|5.0|If someone ever gets around to creating THE definitive list of great Chopin recordings, this disc must be on it! This is clear-eyed, nimble-fingered Chopin performed by one of our greatest living pianists. Pollini had been the Chopin Competition Prize winner in 1960, and this performance shows why. He is tender without over-romanticizing, propulsive without pushing the music frantically. The result is simple, straightforward Chopin recorded in clean, 1972 analog sound. Bravo, Pollini!!
0446577391|5.0|In all their glory the Camels are at it again. With a new assassin, a long con by Annebelle continued and some corrupt politicians we ride the enjoyable ride again. Baldacci has it all his character development is superb. His settings give you the feel you are there and his plot and sub plots all reign pefect. I like most would say be sure to read the Novel you would not make a mistake.
B000TGCR38|4.0|**** 2006. Co-written and directed by Paul Verhoeven. End of WWII in the Netherlands. A Jewish young woman joins the local Resistance and seduces the chief of the Gestapo. Ten years after [[ASIN:B000OVLBHG Starship Troopers]], twenty years after [[ASIN:B000QQH4YS Robocop (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)]] and thirty years after [[ASIN:6305972885 Soldier of Orange]], another excellent movie of the Dutch director. As to most of Verhoeven heroes, the end justifies the means according to Ellis de Vries, BLACK BOOK'S heroine. Between the figure of evil personified by Gestapo officer G&uuml;nther Franken and Derek de Lint, head of the Resistance, there is a grey zone where people try to survive and be in the same time or in the same life, good and bad; the characters of Ronnie, the young Dutch woman who sleeps with German officers and of Ludwig M&uuml;ntze, the chief of the Gestapo, are thus emblematic for the director. The ambiguity of this moral assertion won't surprise those of us who attended the Dutch and American artistic journey of Paul Verhoeven. Highly recommended.
B0013J30XG|5.0|If you're a fan, or between 6 and 15, you'll love it.  That's who the movie is made for - the next generation, not today's geezers.  It contains all of the melo-dramatic elements of the show - the hidden evil behind seeming good (and vice versa) - the devotion to family - the unswerving commitment to doing the right thing - the friendly, platonic relationship between Speed and Trixie - the silliness of the comic relief - and the intensity of the cartoon violence and explosions.<br /><br />The mystery of Racer X is rejuvinated by new plot twists in this movie - completely recreating the excited mystery I felt as a young adolescent. The actor (Matthew Fox) plays the part with perfect intensity and pitch. I only wish X had slugged Speed like he did in the series when Speed asked if X is really his brother Rex. (not really, but that was such a bizarre scene in the series that it sticks in my head)<br /><br />No, the critics don't get it. But they might be right about how people other than fans will feel about it, too. The series appealed to young teens and the movie seems to hit the elements that will appeal to that same demographic today. The graphics are very much like the video games played by today's youths, but with much higher fidelity and intensity than stilted game graphics.<br /><br />The melodrama matches the original series well. Pops and Mom Racer are analogous in their respective over-the-top gruffness and sweetness. As the critics point out, there are some long-winded speeches from Speed and others about right and wrong, which is exactly what I remember and loved about the series. Speed is ridiculously earnest, and exactly the person we each want to be.<br /><br />I've been very excited about this movie and it completely hit exactly what I wanted in a full-production recreation of the quirk, charm and intensity of the series.  My 6 year old loved it too.  It may not be for everyone, but if you're a fan, or if you're between 6 and 15, you'll love it.  The rest can go see Jane Austin.<br /><br />God, I hope they make a sequel.

Yes, there are many great insightful moments throughout the book and I agree with a lot being said but, I still found myself having a hard time getting through certain chapters.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I won't lie to you. This album isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea. There is a *lot* going on here, and if you prefer your music to be simple and straight-forward, it will seem like an impenetrable mush to you. But for those who enjoy complex music, this is a joy to the ears, with there always being something new to pull out of the mix.     As for the music itself, it's hard to describe. Best way I can describe it is \\"creepy industrial electronica shoe-gazer dance emo\\". Except it's not. What it is... well, it's Portishead (shrug).
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|When I originally purchased this film, I based my decision on looking at the customer reviews; that's how I purchase almost any film nowadays (or anything else, really).  However, I wasn't truly impressed with the movie, at least from previews, and thought it to be just another love story; it just happened to be well-written.    The opening sequence, for lack of a better way of putting it, opened my eyes.  I'd watched several musicals in past, and wasn't particularly interested in another, but Once came highly recommended, and the first song in the film proved why.  I was simply awestruck by how powerfully moving all of the music was of the entire movie, and immediately purchased the soundtrack as soon as I could find it.  I now have owned the movie and soundtrack for three months, and can't stop listening at least once a week.     Glen Hansard has one of the most haunting voices I've known, and after having heard it on the soundtrack, I went out and got all of the Frames albums I could find.  His range is one of the best I've ever heard, especially in Once.  Marketa Irglova is wonderful as a solo singer/songwriter, as well as a duet partner, and I've so far found at least three projects she's been involved in.  Both artists are incredible singers in their own right, but by including them both in this movie, someone has done something impossible: make a musical seem like it's a wonderfully felt story, not a production.  I would easily say it's on par with Rent and Across the Universe in it's musical talent, and with Reign Over Me in simply how poignant love, loss, and renewal can be.     The song that has the strongest meaning for me was \\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\", if only for the chorus, and how it conveyed the immediacy of demanding a decision on the part of the spurned lover.  This is, of course, followed by the fan favourite \\"Falling Slowly\\" because of how you could feel the love of the singers through the words \\"Take this sinking boat and point it home / We'vestill got time\\" in the chorus.    To close as best as possible, I easily recommend this film to anyone who wants a new movie to watch.  I'm a guy, and stereotypically I don't watch \\"chick flicks\\", but this movie is more than that; it's for anyone who loves music, and how that music can affect their lives.    It only took one time, but after having seen this film with someone I cared about, I'm convinced it's perfect as can be; it said everything I couldn't, simply because words alone can't do it.    This is the best movie for anyone who can't find the words for what they know to be true, and especially for anyone who loves music and film.  It deserves all the awards it gets.
1423101464|3.0|I'm extremely obsessed with this series, but the 4th installment was lacking a few things.  Although it had a good plot line, there was never a moment when  i was thinking \\"AHH WHAT GREEK MYTH IS THIS I KNOW IT I KNOW IT\\" like i was in the last book.  There wasn't enough Greek mythology influence in it.  Also, character development was weak.  Very weak, in fact.  I hardly feel any difference between the 6th grade Percy Jackson and the high school Percy Jackson, and I expected there to be a lot more maturity and emotions between Annabeth and him.  Although it's an intriguing and fun read, it was definitely missing something compared to the other books.  Hopefully the 5th book will be as good as the first three.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  I laughed and cried in it as it's like an emotional rollercoaster.  I thought Hilary Swank did an excellent job here and played the role of Holly, whose husband Gerry is dying of a brain tumor.  While still alive, he writes Holly letters and she receives them after his death and signs off each time with PS. I Love You.  With every new letter, there is a new adventure.    There is a terrific cast here (Lisa Kudrow, Gina Gershon Kathy Bates and Harry Connick Jr), that make the movie fun and enjoyable.  I didn't know if I was going to like it or not, but have found myself watching it over and over about 4 or 5 times already since buying this on DVD.  It's a nice chick flick/feel good/romantic comedy/drama and a new favourite.  I really love this and think that practically anyone can watch this and come away from it having loved it too.
B000VJAICK|4.0|For me, the word \\"classic\\" means a movie that has stood the test of time. I believe \\"Tremors\\" has stood the test of time. I still enjoy putting it on now and again.
B000000YBQ|3.0|... that so many people rate this album so highly. I don't like the format of the repeated alternate takes, and I don't like the constant background noise of clinking glasses, chatter, and so on. I guess it would make decent background music for a cocktail party and would probably be of great interest to fellow musicians who are interested in Evans's piano technique, but this is an album that I have had for years, and it hardly ever gets played--never, actually.<br /><br />At the time that I bought it I was under the impression that this was a great, essential album, but I don't think it is.
B000WC3AOE|5.0|I originally saw \\"That's Entertainment\\" in its original theatrical release. It was the film that got me hooked on MGM musicals. I, II and III have been a good source for me to help me decide which musicals I want to add to my collection.
B0011Z5NHS|1.0|This Norma is a total disaster on every front. All the singers sound terrible and the staging is an impressive fiasco. Theodossiou and Ventre were in much better voice in the previous Norma Dynamic DVD, but the staging there was even worse. I can't believe that both Theodossiou's and Ventre's voices deteriorated so bad in just 2 years - I think the problem with this production is the huge flat outdoor space with dead acoustic. I think that explains why everyone, including the chorus sounds bad and strained. I heard Simon Orfila in Barcelona 2 years before this production and he did not sound so thin. I also heard Barcellona live 2 years earlier and she did not sound so bad. The chorus does not have an impact because they are spread in one line a mile left and right. I don't understand how anyone can perform in such a space without electronic amplification. The staging looks impressive on photos but it is no more than a series of static symmetrical postures inspired by Delacroix's or David's paintings with no dramatic force. For once I agree with the \\"Gramophone\\" magazine's reviewer John Steane who trashed this DVD from every angle (\\"Unfortunately, on almost every count, this Norma is a definite no-no.\\").
B000PY52EU|5.0|Recently I heard the meditation theme from the opera THAIS. Set in ancient times, it portrays a wanton woman who is redeemed by a monk. This film definitely tells the same story with a 3,000 year divide.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this video!  It is a good overall workout, and it progresses well.  The only part that I don't care for is that Jillian talks too much before you actually start the workout.  I turn on the DVD player and do a warm-up with the tv muted.  I'm ready to go long before she shuts up!  Using this workout each morning has already given me some seriously positive results!
B0013POLS8|5.0|I recently purchased a Yahama high wattage Hdmi amplifier, Samsung Blu-ray disk player with compatible Jbl speaker system, to match my HdTv and I thought this Mariah Carey Blu-ray disk would be the perfect opportunity to test this system, indeed it was. First of all, it is recorded without a flaw and the sound took my new system beyond expectations. If you are a Mariah Carey fan, don't let this Dvd slip by. As usual she is nothing short of fabulous and beautiful. Great Live Show!! She sings all of her big hits. Worth every dime, just what you would expect from the #1 best seller.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|[[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter - The First Season]] is an amazingly innovative series. I was delighted that the writers and actors could turn a twisted american obsession with serial killers into a hit series. Michael C. Hall pulls off the character of Dexter with seeming ease. I cannot imagine any other actor in his role. If you are new to Michael C. Hall, be sure to purchase [[ASIN:B00006NT1S Six Feet Under: The Complete First Season]]. He turns this very adult content series into a hit as well.
B00104W8T6|5.0|The soundtrack from the movie \\"Juno\\" is marvelous and edgy.  The songs are raw and seemingly unedited, and very much in line with the story line of the movie.  The music is fresh and wonderful and best enjoyed when in a pensive mood.  The movie was so delightful that the soundtrack just enhances the experience.  Loved it.
0452289963|5.0|I simply can not say enough wonderful things about this book. It's a must in your library. Enlighting and refreshing insight to your inner being. Easy to read & understand. Buy it & beleive it!!!
0312323867|4.0|Everybody loves hearing the other side of the story right? That's what makes \\"Something Blue\\" such a big draw once you've read \\"Something Borrowed.\\" We know Rachel's story about finding her self esteem and true love but about Darcy her semi-evil friend?    First off this isn't a rehashing of the events in the first book just from Darcy's perspective. It's about what happens after. Darcy is pregnant, thirty and with a man who doesn't want to be with her for good and certainly wants nothing to do with the baby. Dumped and desperate, after making several very bad choices Darcy heads to London thinking she can rebuild her super cool, envy of everybody life there. But she quickly finds out, with help from her friend Ethan who's letting her live in, that her old life is really over and its time for a new Darcy, with whole new priorities, to immerge.    This book is actually better than the first because of the evolution of character. Darcy goes from being someone that would make you hate yourself to a fairly decent person and not in an unrealistic way. And we still get to find out what happens to Rachel and Dex in a round about fashion.    Four point five stars.
0316096199|5.0|Lucky is a thought provoking book that helps readers understand rape from the victim's perspective.  Written in an honest manner, it explores the rational and sometimes irrational reactions of everyone involved - whether victim, friend, or family member.<br /><br />Seabold opens the book with a vivid description of her brutal rape.  Initially, this makes it a difficult read because it forces readers to live through a brutal act.  However, it also helps to expose a reader's preconceived notions and biases.  Seabold describes her struggles to return to a normal life and she honestly discusses societal issues that favor the criminal and penalize the victim.  This is a good read for anyone looking for some insight into a difficult issue.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|This is another Disney classic movie that I reccommend for everyone. This movie is a great one too sit down and let your troubles float away.
630542845X|5.0|The fact that the director had issues prior to movies production is unfortunate. This is one of the most fantastic movies, I will forever love. Made by Disney, the film is superbly done. The minute you begin watch you are taken to a small country town where an unusual boy lives. Ridiculed because of his looks, he has a strange power that allows him to be in touch with others thoughts. This movie will take you back to your childhood memories, you will be emotionally connected one way or another. The acting is superb. You wont be disappointed
B000P12LWY|3.0|I was not able to enjoy this series on regular TV since it was not Closed Captioned.  This disk is CC'd but only on the 480i resolution.    Kind of sad you have to buy the disk just to make a program accessible.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I liked this movie, but I did not love it.  I had really high hopes for this movie, because of the great cast.  Unfortunately, I felt a little let down...I did not feel that Nicholas Cage was up to the standards that he set in movies such as Face Off, Con Air, and Gone in 60 Seconds.  I felt his performance is this movie was bland in comparison....That is just my opinion.  The movie was otherwise a great flick, hence the four and not a three.
B000001FDK|5.0|Grease (Original 1978 Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the coolest soundtrack of all-time. Songs like You're The One That I Want, Summer Nights, Sandy, Hopelessly Devoted to You, and We Go Together are simply irrestible and timeless songs. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John sound great, their vocals are spot-on. Stockard Channing also has a distinctive voice, There Are Worse Things I Could Do is a cheek-in-tongue kinda song, love it! I highly recommend this flawless album and the film as well.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I'm not going to lie, at first I thought this movie was going to be ridiculous--because even though I love Gerard Butler, I wasn't so sure I'd like this movie at all.     So I started out watching it and I have to say it's a beautiful movie, not only sad, but uplifiting and heartfelt. It's a wonderful movie!!! Those who love a nice tear jerker that makes you sigh happily at the end and feel all gushy will love this movie! Not to mention a hot striptease by Gerard Butler ;)!
0307341550|4.0|A newspaper reporter at a small Chicago newspaper is sent on assignment to her old hometown in Wind Gap, Mo. to find out why young girls keep showing up dead.    This was a really quick read. I found it very enthralling, especially the parts where the main character described why she cut herself when she was younger. I never understood cutting, so reading a character trying to describe why they say it and what they are thinking when they do it, helps to understand why young girls do it. That isn't the main part of the story, but just a subplot that really helps the reader get inside the main character's head while she is trying to work on the murder story for her paper in a town she did not want to return. She ran away to get away from her mother, but she was back living with her mother and her young half-sister that her mother adores, while also dealing with the haunting reminders of her dead younger sister that her mother obviously loved more than her.    There is a lot going on in the story, but it is very well written. My only complaint was I saw who was committing the murders about halfway through the book. I didn't guess the full reason, but it wasn't surprising when I found out the full reason behind it. Gillian Flynn is a writer for Entertainment Weekly. She reviews television. I wonder if watching and reviewing crime shows gave her some ideas for the book, but from watching my fair share of them myself, I think that was what helped me guess the killer.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|\\"Tell me what it takes to be number one...\\"<br /><br />Kanye West knows what it takes. He made loud noise a few years ago with his debut cd COLLEGE DROPOUT, and he hasn't really simmered down yet. And, really, Kanye may be an arrogant, self-serving so-and-so, but, damn, can the man back up his swagger! GRADUATION, his third release after the immense [[ASIN:B0001AP12G The College Dropout]] and [[ASIN:B000A2H2C2 Late Registration]], comes at ya hard with infectious tunes that employ tight, well-articulated lyrics and that inimitable Kanye West attitude. With a dubious year for hip hop, I'd say that GRADUATION emerges as pound-for-pound the best rap album of 2007. And, as a bonus, it resoundingly kicks 50 Cent's simultaneously released [[ASIN:B000QUCPUC Curtis]] to the curb.<br /><br />Only 13 jams to this one, compared to COLLEGE DROPOUT's 20 tracks, and LATE REGISTRATION's 21. This probably helps to lend a more restrained feel to GRADUATION (compared to those prior two's excesses; and no skits in this one). GRADUATION hits you up with sweet joints and captivating beats. I'm not enough a creature of music to determine if Kanye's grown as an artist or not or if his stuff here is more mature or not(that \\"genius\\" label sure is touted around pretty liberally). But I do know what I like, and I like most of Kanye's songs here. He again lets loose the producer side of him, resulting in outstanding production values, rich, polished and intricate.<br /><br />GRADUATION is soul and synth and samples, electronics and brass and strings, and sometimes nostalgic, often versatile; all adding up to a bounty of addictive hooks. Most of the tunes serve equally as either bangin' club joints or bob-your-head-as-you-drive music. The danceability factor is simply off the chain. The break out hits (so far) are the techno-funky \\"Stronger,\\" \\"The Good Life,\\" and my personal favorite \\"Flashing Lights\\" (which boasts the best, lushest hook in the cd).<br /><br />Nicely sampling from the likes of Daft Punk (\\"Stronger), Steely Dan (\\"Champion\\"), and even Elton John (\\"Good Morning\\"), Kanye also collaborates with T-Pain (\\"Good Life\\"), Dwele (\\"Flashing Lights\\"), Cold Play's Chris Martin (the piano-driven \\"Homecoming\\"), Lil' Wayne (sloppy in \\"Barry Bonds\\"), and with one of my favorite dudes Mos Def (on \\"Drunken Hot Girls,\\" which, along with \\"Barry Bonds,\\" unfortunately constitutes the CD's sub-par stuff). \\"The Glory\\" is his catchy go-to-church gospel tune. And, although he'll \\"never be as laid back as this beat was,\\" he still takes time to be reflective in the mellow and charmingly melodic \\"Everything I Am\\" and \\"I Wonder.\\" Also worth checking out is the final track \\"Big Brother,\\" which is Kanye's sincere ode to his mentor Jay-Z.<br /><br />It's no secret that Kanye West has opinions. And you may find them grating at times (or maybe not), but dude at least is nothing but forthright. He's not shy about telling the world that he craves and deserves fame and wealth and Grammys up the yingyang. And yet, once in a while, this brash Chicago native throws a curve by pausing his rampant narcissism to pepper in bits of self-deprecation (see \\"Everything I Am\\" for an example). Mostly though, Kanye's agitated style is palpable; dude is vibrant in his neurosis, twitchy in his brazenness. Is it false bravado? Whatever it is, Kanye gives off a vibe unlike other artists'.<br /><br />I may not agree with Kanye's verbal incendiaries much of the time, but one can't deny that you get more out of his music than from the typical hip hop album. Kanye again delves a bit deeper than the standard riffs on gangstas and guns, fancy cribs and shiny dubs, hard street reps and hot chicks (although \\"Drunken Hot Girls\\" kinda puts paid to that last one, huh?). I don't know if his lyrics are necessarily thought-provoking, but they certainly are blunt and honest. So respect to that. Kanye, I guess, will always be a polarizing figure. His music, on the other hand, is more a unifying thing. To go by his chart-topping status, Kanye West is decidedly (to quote my very hip grandma) the shiznit.<br /><br />As the song goes, \\"Did you realize...that you were a champion in their eyes?\\"<br /><br />Yes, he did.s chart-topping status, Kanye West is decidedly (to quote my very hip grandma) the shiznit.<br /><br />As the song goes, \\"Did you realize...that you were a champion in their eyes?\\"<br /><br />Yes, he did.
B000T1JJAW|5.0|Jazz and Blues focus with that Ian Anderson brain.  Nothing sounds even remotely dated.  If you never heard this Tull album before, be prepared for a treat.  Everything is the early Tull style, not the later semi-pretentious stuff. Lively and beautiful.
B00139W3NE|1.0|It's bad enough that the DVD creators have found a way to keep you from  skipping over the FBI warning, movie previews, etc before you can see the movie, but the Golden Compass sinks to a new low! After the afore mentioned stuff you have to suffer thru, The actresses gives a speech after the likes of Al Gore to save her polar bear from \\"global warming\\".  I bought the DVD to see a movie, not to hear about Hollywood's junk science agenda!    Don't buy this!  Hello Hollywood: stick to entertainment, not politics. I've read reviews that the classic Sci-fi movie \\"The day the earth stood still\\" is being remade but the theme is not about preventing global war this time, but Earth is going to be wiped out because we didn't take care of our environment. Gimme a break Pleaaaaaaaaaase!
B00124HR22|5.0|If you never heard this album before, you probably either never heard of Alice Cooper, or you don't like him.  If you don't like him, what are you reading this for?  If you never heard this, ask anyone who knows even a little about  historical rock albums and they don't know squat if they don't consider this album one of the best.  It is almost a perfect rock album, connecting songs with a \\"Death, Kill\\" theme, but who cares?  A perfect driving album, mean, technically amazing and musically very diverse.  Buy This!
B000021Y7X|5.0|I bought this for a friend who is a serious Talking Heads fan. I wasn't. They watched this video so many times and raved about it so much, that I decided to watch it with them one night. I was amazed. It is the best Music video I've ever seen. You won't be able to stay in your seat with this one.     Talking Heads Fan now too!
0393324818|5.0|You always hear about the vast amounts of money that are spent in the world of baseball, but are teams getting their money's worth?  Conventional wisdom would have us believe that teams that spend the most money get the best results.  However, in the world of baseball this is not the case.  This book focuses on the Oakland Athletics, one of the best performing teams in major league baseball, and also one of the lowest paid teams.  How do they do it?    According to this book, this is possible through exploiting inefficiencies in the market.  Baseball, through its years of tradition, has built up a way of evaluating players that doesn't really address how they actually perform.  This leads to undervaluing talent and skills that actually lead to success.  The trick is to be objective and look at things as they really are.  There are many things that people take for granted in every field, and this leads to market inefficiencies.    This is more of a baseball book than a business book.  It is not presented as a road map to success, but rather as a story of a baseball team fighting against the odds.  If you're a fan of baseball, you'll be able to enjoy the story and learn a few things that you might be able to  apply to your own business.  However, if you don't like baseball, you many not find this to your liking.
0393061310|4.0|Jared Diamond has written a comprehensive readable book describing some of the prominent reasons that societies have failed in the past and often succumbed to invaders. It seemed well written to me and although I thought the title a little pretensious, the subject matter is good.
B00005JPSM|4.0|I guess I'm glad I never saw the foreign version of this movie because I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It was a sweet movie with a good overall story line. Aaron & Abigail were great in it and Catherine did a decent job too.  As a wannabe foodie, I also enjoyed all the focus on the food. I actually had not heard much about this movie and I know the reviews were not stellar so maybe that's why I was pleasantly surprised by it.
B000IJ7Q32|4.0|I had read Guns, Germs and Steel by the same author previously.  This nicely rounds out the other work and I would sincerely recommend that both be read in order to come away with a more comprehensive view of the advances, declines and falls of civilizations and some of the things that are germaine to those processes.
B000LXHK22|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  It is smart and funny.  I have watched it at least 10 times and will watch again.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Simply outstanding; this could be one of my favorite musicals ever. And I love musicals! I was never a big fan of the Beatles; but this movie's versions of the songs are truly beautiful and heartfelt. They made me go back and listen to the Beatles' songs, which gained new depth. Visuals are great and the cast is marvelous. I hope Jim Sturgess has a great future ahead of him.<br /><br />P.S. I like the fact that Sony put subtitles in various languages, including Portuguese, on the DVD/Blu-Ray. It was definitely a nice addition.
B000ASATYO|5.0|I had never seen this movie until this past October, and that was only a portion. Still, I must say I was intrigued enough to order the DVD. And then I thought, hey, I'll go for the director's cut. So I really have nothing to compare that to, but let's just that I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />I understand that the movie is something of a cult classic and it is easy to see why. I hate to call it pure horror as it is much funnier and sweeter than that, but it does have the stuff of such. In truth, it is a movie about ghosts rather than a scary movie and the tortured man who works a con operation with them.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Michael J. Fox and I think he does pretty good in this. His character is a little more sensitive than what I have seen him and he pulls it off, but he most comes to life as the stalwart and brave soul we all know he is.<br /><br />The tale itself is really quite imaginative, especially those fascinated by the fun ghosts can offer. In fact, most of the ghosts we meet are nice and funny rather than scary. And hey, someone was actually to make ghosts work with objects in a logical way!<br /><br />This is a great Halloween movie and if this had extra scenes I liked them. The extras are also plenty of fun, featuring the making of, interviews, and even a bit on real ghostly experiences.
0452282152|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I completely loved it.  The movie adaptation was completely beautiful, adding a visual aspect to the story, but the book, as usual, managed to carry more depth to the story; a sense of how very hard the girl had to work, the kinds of pressure she was under and how very dangerous it was for her to pose for the painting.  Unforgettable.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I basically waited for several years for something along the lines of the complete series to come out. This was due to unfortunate misunderstandings on my part concerning the nature of the show.  So I wound up as a college senior before I realized that this show was, in fact, a comedy.<br /><br />And that is when I fell head-over-heels in love with it, for this is the quirkiest, cutest, funniest display of love, family, and friendship to ever worm its way into my heart.  With the leads of the angelic Alexis Bledel and the amazing Lauren Graham, we have the story of a mother and daughter duo living in the adorable New England (and tragically fictional) town of Star's Hollow.<br /><br />The pilot begins with them being accidentally mistaken for sisters, and this leads into the history of the girls--Lorelei became pregnant at sixteen and ran away from her upper-class family.  After daughter Rory is born, Lorelei manages to make a place for them in Star's Hollow and does quite all right for herself.  Then a problem comes along--Lorelei is determined that Rory have the educational opportunities that never worked out for Lorelei, but when Rory is accepted into a prestigious private school, Lorelei cannot afford tuition.  So she turns to her estranged parents, who offer to loan her the money as long as the girls visit every Friday night for dinner.<br /><br />And those are the events that set the entire series in motion, a series that holds all things--first love, second chances, secret love, family, friendship, community, all the silly little things I cannot help but love.  It's a story of family dynamics--if you consider a small, nosy community part of an evergrowing family.<br /><br />This is definitely a girls' show, and I can see why it irritates so many.  But I like the snappy, witty dialogue and the never-ceasing parade of pop culture references.  I like the humor that is there even when things become more serious and dramatic. The show is always fresh, consistently funny, and exceedingly dynamic. It's the kind of show that pulls you in simply because you fall in love with its odd, quirky cast of characters.  Small-town charm and all the sassy, sexy heart that comes with it.<br /><br />And so, I was extremely pleased when I finally had the opportunity to save money by buying the whole set. The carrying-style case is adorable, and someone finally got smart about how to package a whole bunch of DVDs.<br /><br />This is a series with episodes I can watch over and over again.  My sisters and I constantly are reminded of Gilmoric incidents.  I happily say this is one of my favorite shows..

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I remember the first time I ever saw a teaser for this movie. I thought it looked silly and I had to wonder just what Pixar and Disney were thinking. A rat wanting to get fancy Frency food. Please.<br /><br />But time went by, and cuter trailers appeared, and I found myself wanting to see the movie about the cute rat in the restaurant. So it came out and I had a free weekend.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where you spend the whole time thinking \\"This is so good!\\" while at the same time barely having enough time to think so as you are so caught up in the story and the stellar animation. It's subtle, heartfelt, and downright hilarious with a character-driven plot and so many themes I can't possibly count them all.<br /><br />Remy is a rat not altogether satisfied with his garbage-eating existence in the French countryside. He was born with an extreme sense of smell, which makes him useful to his colony when it comes to sniffing out rat poison--one of the many reasons his fellow rats despise humans. But Remy is fascinated by humans and their ability to create things, and eventually his interest leads him into the world of cooking when his nose becomes handy in blending flavors. A tragedy leads him to Paris, more specifically Gusteau's, the fallen-from-grace restaurant that had once belonged to the deceased chef Remy admired. Here he meets Linguini, an awkward young man who can't cook, and they figure they can help each other out.<br /><br />Do not be misled--this is far from being the only part of this incredible story. Rather there is a series of incidents created by a colorful cast of characters that leads us not only from movie's beginning to end but through some amazing character development and more plot events; it's infinitely better than contrived and forced plots that are so often shoved down our throats. This has many stories: the aforementioned, Remy's division between the worlds of rats and humans, an adorable love story between Linguini and a driven cook by the name of Collette, and that of Skinner, the new head chef determined to keep the restaurant under his own power. While we all love an intense character, \\"Ratatouille\\" keeps its players surprisingly realistic and subtle rather than making them into a circus of stereotypes. Admittedly, disbelief must be suspended in certain parts, but the story is so endearing and good that you are certainly willing to do so.<br /><br />The complexity of so many things is what make this film stand out. As Remy is torn between the worlds of humans and rats he is faced with the contradiction of what he is: a rat wanting to cook, but stealing food at the same time. Also there is the problem of Remy wanting credit, but neither wanting to lose his place in the world of gourmet. You must also notice the range between the fanciful talking rats and the realistic problems of wills and DNA testing. It works.<br /><br />I know I said I could not name the many themes circulating through this movie, but I must go at one. The title \\"Ratatouille\\" is not only a pun referring to the rodent characters, but is also a peasant dish never to be served at a fancy French restaurant. It's low, it's common, but as the movie shows can be more than any other food. This is a story about finding greatness in the ordinary.<br /><br />I feel this is one of Pixar's finest. It is a film that will stay with you long after it has finished.and that of Skinner, the new head chef determined to keep the restaurant under his own power.

6302470021|3.0|I had owned an older version.     The movie is not full length. How is this version any better?     It is 7 minutes SHORTER than the older version which had incomplete scenes? Duh!    I loved the original version. It is a funny spoof on James Bond! I grew up with these very funny actors! Anyone not realizing who all the actors are may not appreciate this movie. This Movie is done in British and Period style-humor.     Without the complete scenes this movie is not as effective!

B000SINT52|1.0|People keep paying for movies made by a person who has wasted his \\"talent\\" on partial truths to flat out lies. What type of a person would waste his life on lies?  Oh, yeah...a person who wants to make money off of ignorant people(I say this with no intentions to insult).    It is ashame that people, like Mr. Moore, are not held accountable for their deceit. Well, eventually they will be. I actually feel sorry for him and for those who believe that he is telling them the truth.     People like Mr. Moore actually hold back the truth and belittle and attack those who hold truth and honor as being important.
0743298039|3.0|Although not quite what I expected, I did somewhat enjoy this book. Ms. Setterfield was able to keep me guessing right up until the end, which was enjoyable in itself. My main issue with this novel was that I did not feel that the writing style was constant--one moment, the author would say something incredibly insightful, even beautiful, and the next I would be asking myself \\"is the same person writing this crap?\\" Definitely worth a try if you're a gothic novel fan, though.
B0010358CQ|4.0|Appleseed Ex Machina is the third movie in the series.  As the movies have been substantially spread apart in their realease dates, there are substantial differences in animation between them.  The second movie was a huge step up from the first, melding cinematic graphics with excellent animations.  Ex Machina takes it yet a step further:  cinematic graphics are used exclusively, with no animation.  At first I didn't think I'd care for it as much, but the characters have been infused with an even further level of development through the plot and scripting.  I was also pleased to find that the annoyance level was turned down (i.e. main character didn't yell out 'Briarios' name 300 times through the movie).  All in all, I felt this movie was a worthy installment in the Appleseed series.  Here's a brief breakdown of the movie for ease of reading....<br /><br />-Graphics/Animation:  Top notch, character realism nearly rivals that of FF Advent Children.<br />-Music:  Heavy hitting techno tunes for the action sequences; quite pleasing<br />-Scripting/Voices:  Admirable job on voices and scripting, no complaints<br />-Plot/Character Development:  Great focus on main characters, although almost to the point of making the plot a bit hazy.  If you liked GITS storyline concepts, you'll definitely like this one; very in depth.
0316548189|5.0|This is a fantastic book that provides great insight into one of the most inspirational leaders in modern history. His story in particular and the anti-apartheid struggles in general are fascinating and provide extremely valuable lessons. With his humbleness and incredibly lucid and organized writing style (which admittedly did surprise me), this could be the best autobiography out there. One can only imagine how different the continent would be if other African Nations had such strong leaders with Nelson Mandela's courage and integrity.
1400064287|5.0|I just took a class at Stanford from Chip Heath - I have only read part of this book, but what I have read is excellent. What I can say is his class was incredible - I haven't enjoyed a class that much in a long time. Very eye opening.
1594489505|4.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini's follow-up to his wildly successful novel The Kite Runner, focuses on the women of Afghanistan and their experiences in a war-ravaged Muslim society.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, though it was difficult to read sometimes. There are two primary characters in the book: Miriam and Laila. Miriam is the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy businessman. When her mother commits suicide, her father marries her off hastily in order to avoid his shame. Mariam is married to Rasheed, an abusive older man who punishes her when she can't give him a child. Meanwhile, Laila, a younger woman, discovers that she is unwed and pregnant just as her parents are killed in a bombing. In the interest of self-preservation, she becomes Rasheed's second wife. The two women go on to develop a friendship and an enduring love that, in many ways, saves them both.<br /><br />As difficult as life was for the male characters in The Kite Runner, it is infinitely more difficult for the female characters in this novel. Muslim society can be cruel to its women, who are expected to remain obediant and subservient to their husbands, regardless of the treatment they receive. My heart ached for the characters, for the pain and indignity they suffered, and for the society that enabled such injustice to be carried out.<br /><br />Hosseini's writing is a tad more flowery in this novel than in the first, but not overly so. And because this novel is set against the backdrop of very current events, it feels more topical.<br /><br />I thought this was an excellent second novel. Hosseini used what he already knew (and what he already knew his readers were interested in), but gave us a fresh take on it by examining it through a different lens and a more current time. I thought this was a great way of \\"giving people what they want\\" while still growing as a writer/exploring new territory for him.

B000MXPE7O|4.0|I loved this movie. Parts of it were difficult to watch, but it is a highly interesting, engaging film.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), an idealistic young poetry student at Yale. The son of a high-ranking federal judge, Wilson is tapped to become a member of the elite Skull and Bones society. After accepting, he is drawn further into a world where the expectations of others will govern his decisions. After a passionate roll in the hay with Clover (Angelina Jolie) at a Skull and Bones retreat, Edward learns she is pregnant. Though he is in love with another woman (the hearing-impaired Laura, played beautifully by Tammy Blanchard), Edward weds Clover.<br /><br />The film is set at the end of World War II, when the OSS/CIA were operating/forming. Due to the strong connections of previous members (many of whom went on to work in the military and in government), several young men in the Skull and Bones society are chosen to work in intelligence and counterintelligence. Edward begins work, and the audience watches as he sacrifices one thing after another for his career. Protecting the United States is a noble calling, true, but Edward pays a high price for his devotion. He doesn't even see his son until the boy is more than five years old because of his overseas work. His relationship with his wife, what little there was of it to begin with, deteriorates due to neglect. He can't trust anyone, and so he doesn't.<br /><br />What's fascinating about this film for me is that it isn't all flash and dazzle, like other spy films you may have seen. This film shows the slow, quiet work of the CIA. It shows the strategy behind the organization and what kind of power it wields. It also shows the birth of intelligence gathering in the United States, and it is pretty darn intriguing to go poking into some of those corners of U.S. history. More than anything, though, it illustrates what working in the intelligence industry does to the individuals who commit to it. (And it ain't pretty.)<br /><br />I think Damon plays a role different from his \\"type\\" in this film. Edward has such a character arc. He starts the film with a wonderful, tender relationship with Laura. Though he never seems to be jolly, he is an earnest boy who is not without humor. But by the end of the film, Edward is so careful. He is so silent. He is damaged. Damon expertly paints Edward in all the tones of the things he does not say. This performance is a precise study in minimalism.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has some aching moments as Clover, as well. Being married to a ghost takes an enormous toll on Clover, and I have rarely seen Jolie play a character with such frailty. It was quite touching.<br /><br />The films also boasts fine performances by Robert DeNiro (who also directed), William Hurt, Billy Crudup, and Alec Bladwin. I found this movie riveting, with both character and plot to spare. Acting is fabulous, and the subject matter couldn't get much jucier. Worth seeing.ain't pretty.)

B00005LC1H|5.0|Have watched it for over 30 years on television.  I was sick of waiting for shows to appear on tv so I bought the set.
B000I2J0W4|5.0|I'd heard that the picture was top notch on this transfer and for a film made back in 1979 and released in 1980 it doesn't disappoint. The hotel seems more detailed and the bold colours of those dreadful carpets stand out from the screen. This US cut is about 30 minutes longer than the UK version and offers some interesting little extras. It's a better cut and builds the tension better than the shorter version in my opinion. If you can pick this up for £6 or £7 you can't go wrong if you like this movie. Easily in the top five transfers on HD.
B00005JKN9|1.0|While the story is good, the content represents decades of New York history spanning a longer period then noted on the screen.  Some events did not occur at the same time or during the same era as presented.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|First time, I couldn't listen to the CD and gave up.    Second time, after 6 hours of receiving this CD (About 7 pm), I turned this on again.    It is crazy. I am totally addicted by their new style.    It's not like their other two albums.    It's way more bizarrrre, Blue, creepy and keeps reminded me of drugs, alchol, And most of all the end of the world-all kinds of mentally disoriented tules to make us close our eyes and makes our heartbeat.     Just what I needed.    Although I never had drugs, I can feel what that world is like.    Portishead made this album in their own way. No matter what others say.  They did their own way..    No regret.    Recommend->Silence, Hunter, Plastic, We carry on...Machine Gun...
B000U1ZV3U|3.0|In the beginning it was very slow going and i couldn't help but think that it wasn't Costners best work by a long shot!  In fact the early scenes of Kevins seemed \\"stiff\\" and very amateur, but, don't give up it picks up drastically later on and becomes a very entertaining piece. The stand out performance in this film is given by Dennis Quaid who gave his heart and soul to the part of the sickly \\"Doc Holliday\\" who was dieing of tuberculosis. Dennis lost an incredible 43 pounds for the part to appear \\"sickly\\",  and it worked!
0385334206|5.0|As an avid fan of Kurt Vonnegut, I love all the novels I have ever read by him. However, Breakfast of Champions stands out above and beyond as my favorite. Complete with Vonnegut's classic, almost childish drawings and an appearance by the author himself, this book is truly amazing. Vonnegut tells it all like it is, from Thomas Jefferson to Christopher Columbus. This book truly is a rare masterpiece from beginning to end, and I would greatly recommend it for anyone who likes to have a good, honest laugh at life and all its ups and downs.
B0011KQSZ4|1.0|I cannot recall any other time in my life where I watched a comedy and did not laugh a single time.  It was beyond strange - it was freakish.  And they had the cast and a pretty good plot (if unoriginal)to pull off a rather good comedy.... The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to rank it for the review to be accepted.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Ok so i bought this with my gift card around Christmas Time and i must say I have watched it like a million times. The movie was excellent and so detailed. I would expect nothing less from BBC. I was a little iffy on the boredom factor of the video but after seeing Blue Planet I had to get it and see what all the hullabaloo was about. i watched it and absolutely loved it. Plus the narration was excellent as well and really kept you engaged. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone into animals,nature, and outdoor enthusiast alike as it will take you places and show you bizzare things from all around the globe without ever leaving your living room! Buy it!
B0009A40ES|5.0|To begin American Psycho I believe is in the class of film, in which every scene is perfectly shot and arranged.  It is important to note that this film is not for the masses, hence the numerous poor reviews. Despite what they may say this film is pure art.  Its meaning is not clearly defined, every viewing is a potentially new experience all together. Visually the film is amazing, with haunting backdrops of new york city. look at this film as a portrait. what of? this is for you to determine...
1581806574|4.0|Ok, so i got this from barnes and nobles a few months a ago and so far it has been really great to use. It offers great tips for beginners and its layed out in an easy to understand kind of format which i really enjoyed. though i really like the colors and pictures in the book, the step by step how to's weren't all that great as they are really detailed and might not be great for someone who is new to drawing really intricate and detailed pictures. but all in all its a great book and well worth the 20$ i paid for it and it would make a great gift for someone really into dragons,mythical creatures, and drawing! :)

B0007M22TI|5.0|I thought that I was getting a cd when the dvd was ordered. That was a wonderful mistake! My wife and I watched it the next Saturday night, since we can't afford the tickets for the real concert. We recommend this video highly! Even if this is ordered by mistake, the experience is worth it!

B000PMGS8G|5.0|Keep in mind that the effects are &#34;80's Awesome&#34;, Flash is a great movie.  It has something for everyone and is a fun family film to boot.  This was one of my favorite films as a kid and the soundtrack is amazing.  The surprising thing about this film is how engaging all the supplemental characters come to be.  They are not the paper-cut &#34;extras&#34; that permeate so many other films of this genre.  FLASH is legendary!  Enjoy!
B0000024IE|5.0|This was my second PE album, I only knew 2 tracks from the cd. I bought this cd just because of the name op PE, and what a buy!<br /><br />The Public Enemy style is unique. Chuck D with his raw voice and Flav with his more higher voice and light sense of humour, those two make a unique combination. Terminator X also makes the tracks immortal by mixing the beats with great samples and sort of solos in the chorus(like the drums in \\"Revolutionary Generation\\"). What also makes them unique is the \\"odd\\" tracks they make like the song \\"Pollywanacraka\\". A nice beat with a voice that actually seems to speak, but still telling the story in style.<br /><br />This cd contains also a pair of awesome pieces of rap history tracks like Fight the Power, Power to the People, Fear of a Black Planet and Welcome to the Terrordome. The tracks on this album are \\"hanging together\\", which makes the cd immortal, it contains no weaknesses and is just a piece of music history!<br /><br />Even if you don't know the music of PE too well(I only had It Takes a Nation to Hold Us Back), you should buy this one...there's no reason to listen to the samples first to see if it's worth buying, because you can buy this album blind!<br /><br />This is by far the best CD I bought in 2008, should have done it way earlier...
B0001VV1GK|5.0|This was a gift for our 2-year old grandson. He LOVES it! Aside from some initial trouble with the screws putting it together, it is a well made, durable and sturdy toy!  Matchbox cars, 'Cars' cars and the small wooden one that comes with it all work well.  He plays with it for hours at a time and gets a kick out of using the elevator......  I highly recommend this toy.   Update: October 2008 - Matt is now 2 1/2. After 6 months of full time use, this toy is STILL his favorite. It is STILL in great condition and STILL affords hours of creative fun!
0316067601|2.0|This book is a portrayal of a Navy SEAL - his early upbrining, the SEAL training program that so few pass and most importantly, his role in an operation in Afganistan that ended in disaster for his team and a rescue team. His biases and perspectives are not mine, but I didn't mind hearing them - after all, they probably reflect widely held beliefs within the military...  On the other hand, there are parts of the book that stretch credulity (Marcus shot an Afgan between the eyes, who then fell screaming over a cliff), and there is more fluff than needs to be. Overall, a disappointment.
0765318741|5.0|Richard Matheson is one of those writers that many of us have never heard of but who has had a huge influence on a generation of very successful writers.  Stephen King, Dean Koontz, and others have all acknowledged their debt to Matheson with no less than Ray Bradbury calling him \\"One of the most important writers of the twentieth century.\\"<br /><br />\\"I Am Legend\\" is set in Los Angeles and told from the viewpoint of Robert Neville, the apparent sole survivor of a worldwide plague.  But the plague does not kill; instead, it transforms its victims into creatures with all of the characteristics of vampires:  an aversion to sunlight and garlic, a lust for drinking blood, and a fear of religious symbols and mirrors.<br /><br />Because of a unique experience in his past, Neville has developed an immunity to the bacteria and survives the plague.  His life soon deteriorates into a struggle for survival as groups of vampires hunt him, seeking to drink his blood.<br /><br />Neville turns his house into a fortress, stocked with a generator, canned food and bottled water.  During the day, he roams the city, finding and killing vampires in their sleep.  At night, he locks himself inside while vampires, some of whom were his neighbors and friends, circle his house, calling his name.  There's something really creepy about the scenes where Neville's neighbor, now vampire, wanders outside the house calling \\"Come out, Neville!\\"<br /><br />Written in 1952, \\"I Am Legend\\" is a brilliant and innovative story that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.  I read this book after reading Stephen King's \\"[[ASIN:B000OJKT3K Salem's Lot]]\\" and it's obvious that King borrowed some of his ideas from Matheson.  King has even admitted that Matheson is \\"the author who influenced me most as a writer\\".<br /><br />This story is not a thrill-a-minute joy ride, but the depth of the story is incredible as it explores the psychological impact that comes from being a lone survivor.  We also get to follow Neville's progress as he investigates and learns more about the vampire bacteria and how to fight it.<br /><br />There are two especially innovative parts of this story:<br /><br />1) Matheson gives a scientific explanation for the existence of vampires.  He explains their desire to drink blood and aversion to sunlight and garlic in scientific terms.  It makes the idea of vampires more believable and the story more real.<br /><br />Spoiler ahead!<br /><br />2) Despite the other interesting ideas Matheson introduces to the vampire story, the most original is the unusual twist at the end when Neville discovers that not all humans infected with the bacteria are completely transformed into vampires.  Ironically, these infected \\"living\\" view Neville as we view vampires - a \\"monster\\" who comes into their bedrooms at night and kills them in their sleep.  He is no longer the \\"good guy\\" who is fighting to survive.  For them, he has become the evil in the night.  He is their \\"legend\\".<br /><br />This last point makes \\"I Am Legend\\" something special.  It is a story that defies convention and dares to do something new, to bring a fresh take to an old myth.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br />Michael Mihalik is the author of [[ASIN:0978545702 Debt is Slavery: and 9 Other Things I Wish My Dad Had Taught Me About Money]].

B0010X8NF0|4.0|A film that could have been a real discovery of India and Hinduism. Alas we are very far from that because of the absolutely egocentric and self-centered psychologically claustrophobic closing up of each one of the three brothers onto each one of themselves. They hate themselves and one another with the greatest amount of love and yet they can't stand one another. They are looking for their mother who disappeared before their father's funeral they had to bury alone. She took refuge in some kind of Christian nunnery in India and she just does not hear the voices from her sons or from the world or from even herself. She is entirely locked up in an supposedly altruistic dedication to the poor of India and does not see she is selfishly rejecting her own responsibilities towards her own children and family. The spiritual pilgrimage of these three brothers becomes a nightmare when they have to travel together in a deluxe first class sleeper compartment on an Indian train and can't stand their mutual guts. They will eventually get themselves kicked off the train. But we miss all the spirituality of this country, this subcontinent, not to speak of the Hindu religion that is reduced to a poor series of worn-out clich&eacute;s. So what's left when the Darjeeling tea has been brewed, poured and drunk except some water to be passed in a few hours? It does not even appeal us to go there and experience such situations. They definitely have it too easy, climbing to the top of some sacred rock. It should be hard and there should be several stages to be respected. The path to enlightenment is in eight stages, at least in my Buddhist line. Here we have one single race and some foolish clown faces and antics on the top. Could have been a lot better with a little bit of an effort.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B00104QSOM|1.0|I had to stop watching after 1 hour because the soundtrack was driving me crazy.     It is too loud, the music is totally inappropriate for the scenes being played and it is just plain awful. I have never , ever watched a movie where the score is so distracting and annoying.    If you can turn the sound off and lip-read, then for all I know the movie might be OK.

B000002WNP|5.0|I would recommend this for anyones collection.  Elvis is great, the music is great & the sound is great.  No re-mixes!!!!!!  Its just the way Elvis wanted it to sound like.  No one can improve perfection.  I wish they would leave his music alone.  These cd's are great!!!!  You also need to get the 50's & the 70's Masters to complete the collection.  All 3 of them are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002LOM|4.0|This is a good CD, though not great one.  It has a lackluster production, like it's deliberately unfinished.  It's a shame, as it has some great (and I mean great) Morrissey songs on it.  Lyrically, he's still as awesome as ever.  Asian Rut has a brilliantly sad, operatic tone to it.  My favorite song has to be Driving Your Girlfriend Home with its great line \\"how did I end up so deeply involved in the very existence I planned on avoiding?\\".  That's another brilliant Morrissey lyric.  The Harsh Truth of the Camera Eye is a great song, but it's hindered by the lax production.  I'm the End of the Family Line is very good, and the quieter production actually helps it.  The song There's a Place in Hell for me and my Friends has another great Morrissey title, and the song is a great one too.  If your a Morrissey fan, you need to get this one.  If you're just a casual fan, you should download a few of the songs.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|There a lot of snobs who try to knock any band that gets any public recognition while clinging to obscure bands that can't sing or play their instruments.  Why all the music politics?  I've listened to television, velvet underground and the stooges... I have their albums.  The worst strokes song is easily better than the best television song especially because the singer of television has a HORRIBLE voice.  Velvet underground is a mere novelty, and the stooges are ok at best.  If anything, the strokes build from all the obscure idie bands and make them actually listenable by having talent.<br /><br />There are so many few bands left that are actually good songwriters and the music snobs all want you to not listen to any of them and sit in a basement listening to Marque Moon all day.  Don't listen to them and buy this album and if you are a fan of rock music this album can not possibly fail to deliver.  The strokes are one of the only true rock bands left.  When the rest is horrible rap-metal, brat-punk, emo-trash, and bubblegum-nonsense, you gotta thank your lucky stars for a band like the strokes.  I Can't say enough about all their albums, pure songwriting genius.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and tell the hipster snobs living in their mom's basement to sit on a stick.  Buy this album!  Don't ever let anyone dictate to you what is \\"cool\\" or not.  Use your own ears and you'll be rewarded.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds have just released the best record of 2008, their first in nearly four years. Dig!!!Lazurus!!!Dig!!! is number fourteen in their canon and   though some of Nick's albums tend to be a bit uneven, albeit brilliant in a scattered kind of way, this new release captures him and The Bad Seeds at their mature, informed best.  This is undoubtedly one of their most cohesive, coherent, and beautifully engineered albums yet.  But don't think for a minute that this one doesn't rock.  Just because Nick recently turned 50, time hasn't slowed him or his bandmates.  Drawing upon the raw energy of last year's raucous Grinderman collaboration seems to have infused the Bad Seeds with a power and freedom not seen in years; not seen, in fact since 1994's Let Love In. From the opening title track Dig Lazarus Dig with its irresistible, insistent beat until the smooth groove of the finale More News From Nowhere, there isn't a weak song, not even a weak moment to be found.  I must make special mention of the beseeching scorcher We Call Upon The Author, undoubtedly the album's apogee, and of a personal favorite Lie Down Here, a throwback sound to the mid 60's with a screeching lead guitar with The Bad Seeds providing  vocal support behind Nick's snarling lead. I could go on mentioning individual cuts that stand out-all but a couple are immediate grabbers- but the whole of the project sustains and creates a dark, irreverent mood that is simultaneously loud, exciting, and full of unexpected turns. Amid some of the album's reined in and controlled ambient noise there is a dark humor loosed, certifying that Nick Cave more than understands the world we live in, and like a prophet he undermines America's cultural landscape while exploring its soundscapes.  In short,... prolix, prolix, nothing a pair of scissors can't fix...this a masterwork.  It goes almost without saying that Nick Cave is at the the top of his game now: 2 successful albums in successive years, a secondnovel on the way, upcoming tours with both of his groups, great soundtrack work with scores for Andrew Dominic and John Hillcoat films.  To quote a line from the second track Today's Lesson, \\"We're Gonna Have A Real Cool Time Tonight...\\"  Listening to this new CD, I can assure you, we most certainly shall.
037571457X|5.0|I've never read a graphic novel until this book.  I first learned about this book after reading the amazing reviews for the movie version of this book.  I always make it a point to read the novel before seeing any movie so decided to pick this up.  Having read quite a few fiction and history novels on  post-WWII Iran(including Septembers of Shiraz recently), this was a topic that highly interests me.<br /><br />Last night I started this book and couldn't put it down until I was done.  It is a captivating and immersive experience and I just ordered \\"Persepolis 2\\" and can't wait to read it as soon as it arrives from amazon.  I loved the simplicity of this novel.  The dialogue and story telling perfectly captures an adolescent Marjane in Iran through the crumbling of Shah Reza Pahlavi's regime and the initial promise and subsequent reality of the Islamic revolution.  Satrapi effortlessly captures all of the emotions that she undoubtedly went through during these times, both in word and in picture.  While I was somewhat skeptical about the illustrations, they once again added an additional layer of context and dimension that took this from a great book to an extraordinary book.<br /><br />If you've never thought of reading a graphic novel, do yourself a favor.  Buy this book and enjoy -- it is a true treasure.
0452289963|5.0|This book is a must read for people who are ready to change their lives fo the better.
0143038419|5.0|This book was very honest, sometimes raw, and very real.  While I see some reviewers have called the author petty and shallow, I think it gives a very real look into what makes us all unique human beings -- flaws and all.  Could any of us be this honest about what makes us quirky or the flawed individuals we all are?  Elizabeth Gilbert becomes a more self-aware and a slightly improved version of her former self, but doesn't change entirely.  Would we believe it if a person truly went through a transformation that turned them into someone else completely?  The point of this story, in my mind, is for us to be more self-aware, and learn how to be better, without losing or ignoring ourselves in the process.  And, I appreciate the author's candid disclosure about herself, her life, and her experiences.  She's obviously intelligent and funny, and I enjoyed reading her story.  It leaves the reader feeling like he/she isn't alone in being an imperfect, but uniquely wonderful, human being.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird, J.B. Lippincott & Co., Harper Lee, July 11, 1960  Reading Level: Ranges: Young Adult, eighth grade, 13 years or so  Number of pages: 296  Genre: Southern Gothic drama  Synopsis of Plot:  This book takes place in a small town in the south; Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression.  The main character of the book is a five year old girl nicknamed Scout and she tells the story from her point of view.  Scout and her brother Jem, live with their father, Atticus Finch, who is a prominent lawyer in town.  In the summer, Scout and Jem become fascinated with a recluse neighbor, Boo Radley.    Life is dramatically changed when their father, Atticus, takes on a controversial case.  A white woman, Mayella Ewell, accuses an innocent black man named Tom Robinson of raping her.  It is obvious that he is innocent as the trial goes on due to Atticus' questioning.  Nonetheless, in a small southern town still full of prejudice, the all white jury finds Tom Robinson guilty.  Due to Atticus taking on the case, his family and children are faced with many threats and scorn from the angry white people in Maycomb.  Atticus stands constant in his conviction to fight racial inequality and teaches this good to Scout and Jem.  Near the end Tom Robinson is shot as he attempted to escape from jail.  This is a hard lesson for Scout and Jem to learn as they feel the injustice of Robinson's position.  Mayella's evil father, Bob Ewell vows revenge on the Finch's since Atticus made him appear a fool during the trial.  The book ends with him attacking Scout and Jem on their way home from a school play.  The children are saved by their recluse neighbor, Boo Radley.  Boo stabs Bob Ewell and is luckily saved from punishment by the police officer who claims that he saw Bob Ewell fall on his own knife.  The Finch children, Scout and Jem grow up during the entire process of the trial.  They are faced with many examples of evil and good in people and lose their innocence through thetrial.    Address negative aspects of the book:  One of the main themes of this book is forgiveness.  Atticus always forgives people for their evil traits.  For example, Atticus is able to forgive people for being racist and chose to admire them instead for their positive traits, such as courage or love.  While I think it is good that Atticus teaches readers forgiveness, I think that it can be frustrating.  Some people and acts do not necessarily deserve forgiveness, like the character Bob Ewell.  I think that it is important to make sure that the seriousness of the racism in the south during those times is not taken lightly and forgiven, but remembered for the giant mistake it was.    Your appraisal of the book:  I would definitely recommend reading this book.  When I read this book in fourth grade, it changed my life.  Being able to discuss such serious issues and get new viewpoints and a history lesson at the same time is an amazing part of this book.  I think this book should be read by every student in America.  We can only learn from our mistakes in history by discussing them and learning about them in literary works.  This is a perfect book that can address that lesson for students today.  Buy this book and read it for all of these reasons.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This is a smart, fun, action-packed film.  It engages you start-to-finish.  The intensity grabs you through any screen -- the big screen or your own television.  The characters are well developed, and the actors play their roles perfectly.  I highly recommend all the Bourne movies!
B0016K40KY|5.0|I think the DVD stands on its own merit. This review is for the service and delivery, and for this I score top marks. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It doesn't get any better than that.
B000YAA68C|2.0|This film is all about having your emotions manipulated.  If you want a good cry, if you want a film to unabashedly try to fill you with very specific emotions, then this is the film for you.  While I will acknowledge that any film is going to try to provoke a response, not many will be as unsubtle and as unapolegetic as this one.  In fact, this is all about the feeling, not at all about the story.  The only point of the story is to make the viewer experience and engage in certain emotions.  If you don't want to go along, then many parts of the film are going to be agonizing.  And you could well believe that this is one of the least artful, most clumsily produced films of recent years.  To be honest, I'm definitely not among the former.  This film simply didn't move me.  All its tactics were too obvious and heavy-handed for me to want to go along.  On the other hand, it wasn't an utter piece of crap either.  If we could give half stars I would give it 2.5.  All in all, I don't regret having seen it, but neither do I feel that it has in any way enriched my life.<br /><br />I know this was based on a popular book.  I'm an obsessive reader, but quite frankly my reading all goes int other directions.  So I couldn't care less whether it does or does not remain faithful to a book that I will never read.  What are the movie's pluses and minuses?  The minuses first.  As I said above, it really doesn't have much of a story.  Or rather, the story isn't the point.  This is a mush fest.  I just didn't feel the mush.  Most of the film left me cold and disinterested.  The artifice was too obvious, the attempts to manipulate too blatant, the nuances pretty much nonexistent.  In other words, at the very heart of the film there was pretty much nothing.  The whole film struck me as hollow.<br /><br />The pluses, however, are many.  Even in an age of great film soundtracks, this one stood out.  Over the opening credits they played my favorite song off the great Camera Obscura album LET'S GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY, \\"Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken.\\"  Then at the wake that opened the post-credits they played the great Pogues song from IF I SHOULD FALL FROM GRACE WITH GOD, \\"Fairytale of New York.\\"  And the music stayed interested after that.  OK, the soundtrack is superficial compared with the main story, but suferficialities can keep a film interesting even when it is at core a failure.<br /><br />Visually the film was eye candy throughout, especially when it got to the scenes in Ireland.  Again, this won't substitute for a good story, but it gives you something to do when the story fails to show up.  I defy anyone not to be impressed by the verdant landscapes show in the scene where Gerry and Holly meet for the first time.<br /><br />Finally, while the story isn't up to their talents, the film features a strong and interesting cast.  I've always wondered why Hillary Swank hasn't had a more interesting career than she has had.  She's had a couple of Oscar quality roles, but the quality drops off sharply after that.  Perhaps she has been hurt by the fact that in her two biggest films she played a female transsexual trying to pass for male and a boxer.  Hopefully a girlie role like this one will expand the range of roles made available to her.  Gerard Butler plays Gerry.  His career is an interesting one as well.  He's been in a surprising variety of films, but big stardom has eluded him.  He seems poised to make a leap to the A list, especially after the success of 300.  I was delighted to see James Marsters as Gerry's business partner (though it was interesting that later, when Gerry's letter was telling Holly that she needed a job that she could love, but that \\"vampire slayer\\" was one of them, that in her Slayer poster there were no BUFFY references -- still it was nice to see Marsters in a non-SF or fantasy role).  Kathy Bates, Dean Winters, Lisa Kudrow, Gina Gershon, Harry Connick Jr., and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.<br /><br />So, the conjunction ofa lot of nice surface elements results in a watchable film.  Mind you, a lot of people are going to love this.  They won't object to the emotional manipulation and the cloying sentimentality that is this film's raison d'etre.  I did object, so as a result it had very minimal appeal.  But it did have a little.  And as yet another vampire on BUFFY put it (not James Marster's Spike, but The Master), \\"Sometimes a little is enough.\\"in a watchable film.  Mind you, a lot of people are going to love this.

B00004U8P9|5.0|I will be totally honest, I'm 26 years old and I didn't watch this movie until I was 23, because I was skeptical and I didn't think I would like it.  Boy was I wrong!! From the first musical number til the very end, I had a grin plastered on my face.  This is a different sort of tale, but very exciting and I absolutely LOVE musicals so it's right up my alley.  Tim Curry is incredible as Frankenfurter, Susan Sarandon SINGS in this movie, using her real voice!  And Barry Bostwick is hilarious as Brad Majors.
B00005V331|5.0|While many believe this to be the album that originated all 'extreme metal' genres (thrash, black, death etc). The simple idea even without that is this album is great. From start to finish, this British trio (Cronos, Mantas, and Abaddon) pull off a masterful set of metal nuggets. While their obvious limited musicianship is there, you wont notice it. There was a certain spark of creativity on this record, making it extremely fresh and brutal. Even for most metal standards this is a bleak album. The real star of the album though is the production. It's about as terrible and primitive as you can get, which is what makes it that much better. The most well known cuts include the title track, Poison, Angel Dust and possibly Venom' most important contribution to metal: Witching Hour. A few lesser known songs though actually come off as real classics like Sons Of Satan, 1000 Days In Sodom, and In League With Satan. The remastered/expanded edition has a slew of bonus cuts, the best being the single that came out along with the album 'Bloodlust w/ In Nomine Satanas', also two of Venom's best songs and would go to become live staples. While some may say the Satanic concept has been done, these guys truely take it to new extremes. While Venom may not be exactly black or death metal, they definetly influenced both genres (along with other bands like Bathory, Kreator and Celtic Frost). The band remain controversial among the metal camp for the obvious tag of huge invention to our current underground metal scene but all that aside this record is righ up there with Master Of Puppets, Reign In Blood, Paranoid, Peace Sells, Among The Living and Blizzard Of Ozz as metal masterpieces.
B000YAA68C|5.0|(Slight, inconsequential spoiler)    I have to say, when I saw the preview I thought to myself - I NEVER want to see that movie.  It wasnt until today that on a very rare irrational whim, I decided \\"What the hell, I'll just buy it.\\"  I typically dont like movies with a corny, hallmark card love story, and thought that was what this was going to be.     I was very happily proved wrong.    Although I think they should have chosen someone a bit more soft, vice the slightly mannish Hilary Swank, the movie, to me, was perfection.  Sure there were holes here and there like how she managed to keep the large, New York apartment after not working for the better part of two months, or how the supposed \\"best friend\\" didnt know who she was until after he slept with her... but you quickly get over it when you realize the true plot line of the story.    Its not about the stages of grief as much as it is about pure, blissful love and that sometimes, no matter what we do, the things we hold most dear to us can be taken in an instant.    I sobbed.  I laughed.  I got that fluttery feeling in my chest.  Truth be told, I definitely sobbed more than the other two, but its what made the story REAL.      Im glad I bought this movie.  I would reccomend it in a hearbeat.

Anyone who grew up watching Marlin Perkins on Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom and the pseudo nature films on The Wonderful World of Walt Disney will quickly appreciate the world-wide scope and amazing cinematography of Planet Earth.  From the ultra slow-motion shot of a killer whale shooting out of the water to the first ever footage of the ultra rare and endangered snow leopard, every disc is a treat for the eyes and the soul.
B000RJO58M|5.0|I first saw this movie late one night while bored.   I hated it.  I was also really tired and not paying much attention to it.    I caught it again, 2 months later, on HBO or something.  It was the only thing on, so I watched it.  I just about laughed until I cried throughout the whole movie.    Much like Shaun of the Dead, this movie is a pure bred cult classic.  With the same perfect balance of humor and gore, they got it right one more time.      Officer Angel (aka Officer Angle) and his gang of rural cops go from one suspected murder to the next in sheer and utter blindness about what the truth of the situation is until the very end.  It'll have you splitting at the seams from laughter, and on the edge of your seat from the suspense.    Enjoy!

B000E6UK5K|4.0|I'm not going to go too much into this album because the previous reviewers have already done a good job on that for the most part, but emphasize more on Dave as a guitarist in general. This album really showcases his talent on that 6-8-12 string wonder instrument that R&R has made a penis extension in modern music courtesy of Chuck Berry.    Dave is not a very eclectic guitarist compared to his progressive-rock contemporaries like Steve Howe, Robert Fripp, Steve Hackett etc. But Dave has an ability to take 1, 2 or 3 notes and make them soar through the stratoshpere with absolute beauty. I've always looked at Dave in the same vein as other guitarists like Robbie Robertson, The Edge and others, as simplistic but getting the most out their melodies with real feeling.    Dave certainly shows his chops here on this album even though the-ever-present Floyd sound is still there. Roger Waters may have transmitted the lyrical messages, but Dave supplied the transmitter with his uncanny ability of melodicism. Keep going Dave!

0006167926|5.0|The Murder of Roger Ackroyd<br /><br />The narrator, James Sheppard M.D., tells about the little village of King's Abbot. Widow Ferrars died in her sleep from an overdose of veronal, a drug to induce sleep. Her husband died a year earlier - gossip said he was poisoned. Roger Ackroyd, an immensely rich manufacturer had thoughts of marrying widow Ferrars (they would be richer). Ackroyd was a widower without a child (Chapter 2), and lived in a mansion with relatives and servants. There is a new arrival, a stranger named Hercule Poirot. Conversations tell about the people and personalities. Later Dr. Sheppard visits Roger Ackroyd. A letter from Mrs. Ferrars brings shocking news: she poisoned her husband and was being blackmailed! Dr. Sheppard leaves Ackroyd and returns home. Later a telephone call sends him back to find Ackroyd was murdered! The police are summoned, and Poirot begins his parallel investigation. The chapters tell of the investigative procedure. Everyone connected has something to hide, and Poirot (aided by Dr. Sheppard) finds out what the secrets are.<br /><br />The usual convention is to plant little clues throughout the story so an attentive reader can figure out the mystery before the last chapters. Did you? The first time I read this book I had a hunch, but it seemed crazy. Is the first clue in Chapter 3? Is there another in Chapter 17 or Chapter 24? As the suspects are eliminated who will be left? Were you shocked and surprised at the conclusion? Christie examined the fictional lives of the upper class in a small English village. Do the sins of Ralph and Flora reflect the morals of the aristocracy? Are they like the people in a TV show? Fiction must reflect reality to be believable. Reading this again after forty years I noticed the feminine characteristics of the killer. Was this symbolic for a personality that could not be mentioned? This was not her first novel but the one that made her famous. Afterwards she disappeared for a number of days. Personal problems? Mary Roberts Rinehart famous earlier novel \\"The Bat\\" had a similar plot.<br /><br />The lifestyles described here were damaged by the Great Depression, and mostly killed off by WW II. Inflation has made the monetary figures far out of date. They had automobiles and telephones, but no radio [electricity?]. The comments about coldness say there was no central heating. Do the marriages without children have some hidden meaning? Or merely a way to simplify the story? There is one problem in this story. How did the killer know beforehand that an alibi was needed for the murder?
B00007KWHP|5.0|I don't leave too many reviews, but I'll make an exception for this album. Fragile ranks firmly in the top ten albums of all time along with Sgt Pepper, Dark Side of the Moon, Electric Ladyland, Zeppelin IV, Moving Pictures, and others. I highly recommend it.  This is a concept album, where each Yes member contributes solo pieces like We Have Heaven, the Fish, and Mood For a Day, to compliment the longer, and more complex group efforts like Roundabout, South Side of the Sky, and Heart of the Sunrise. Songs lead into other songs perfectly like on so many other classic albums.It's brilliant.
B0013J30XG|5.0|Saw this in Imax and was very impressed! This movie captured the heart and soul of the Speed Racer cartoon.<br /><br />A family movie with a good message. Highly recommended.
B000XA5K48|5.0|This movie is over the top, ignores the laws of physics, and has lots and lots of violence. I have not laughed that hard at an action flick in a really long time.  The one liners were great.... the plot, what there was of one, was to move along the action sequences, and the action sequences were just fun. What a great movie after a long week to just check out, watch stuff blow up (get shot up), and laugh. My husband and I may work out a drinking game to go with the movie, for really bad weeks.
B000002J1O|5.0|The four albums from Nursery Cryme through Lamb Lies Down on Broadway are the classic albums that represent the band's peak (\\"[[ASIN:B000002NZO Trespass]]\\" and \\"Trick of the Tail\\" are a notch down but still great.  \\"[[ASIN:B000002J1Q Genesis Live [Definitive Edition Remaster]]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000007RU1 Genesis Archive, Vol. 1: 1967-1975]]\\" round things out).  Each one of these contains material that is absolutely must-have, so it's hard to pick one favorite.  A lot of focus is given to \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" because it's the last one with Peter Gabriel, and also their most ambitious project, but I think a good argument can be made why this one is their peak.  Certainly \\"Lamb\\" contains a lot of great stuff but, as double-LP concept albums tend to be, there is a fair amount of filler material which rounds out the \\"story\\", but which makes the last quarter of it lose steam, IMO.<br /><br />SEBTP is as close as any of Genesis' albums to being representative of all the qualities that made them so wonderful.  You even get a catchy pop ditty, \\"I Know What I Like\\".  It starts out with an ominous-sounding machine-like roar, then a quintessential Gabriel spoken intro \\"It's one o'clock...\\" before launching into the song, which tells the story illustrated on the cover.  IMO, as a pop song, this one is superior to anything ever done by the trio version of the band.<br /><br />The oddest song is definitely \\"Battle of Epping Forest\\".  This is the one that most clearly has Peter Gabriel's imprint on it.  The lyrics narrate a turf war between gangs in east London in stylized way that makes it sound like a medieval battle.  Gabriel puts on various voices and affects to depict different characters, which are sometimes hilarious, and sometimes just irritating, frankly.  It's allegedly based on a real news story, though no one can find the article, it seems.  The whole thing drags on a bit long, and doesn't entirely work (I sometimes skip it), but give it an \\"A\\" for creativity and uniqueness.<br /><br />\\"Firth of Fifth\\" is one of their \\"epic\\" songs, with a big, sweeping theme, and lyrics that invoke legendary themes (I had to look up what \\"undinal\\" meant :)).  It also features an all-too-rare acoustic piano solo by Tony Banks, and most notably, was is, IMO, Steve Hackett's greatest performance on any Genesis album (I'm not so familiar with his solo stuff).  The guitar solo is absolutely spectacular in its simplicity.  Unlike so many other rock guitarists, Hackett doesn't focus on flash and speed, but rather on creating sonic landscapes and moods.  The solo on this song is the greatest example.  I always felt that Hackett didn't get enough exposure in Genesis, and this ultimately caused his departure.  The short \\"After the Battle\\" is another great example of this, and also is a great airy counter-balance after \\"Epping Forrest\\".<br /><br />The album opens and closes with two long multi-part songs \\" Dancing with the Moonlight Knight\\" and \\"Cinema Show / Aisle of Plenty\\".  \\"Moonlit Knight\\" is a thinly-veiled criticism of trends in the UK at the time, dressed in the legend of King Arthur, and is one of Gabriel's greatest performances.  It begins with an a Capella vocal, and gradually builds in intensity and complexity.  \\"Cinema Show\\" likewise begins with a gentle love story and then proceeds to stranger territory, mentioning Tyresias, an ancient Greek seer whom the gods turned into a woman, and then back to a man (I had to look it up too!).  At the end there is \\"Aisle of Plenty\\", which refrains the music and the lyrical theme of \\"Moonlit Knight\\", with a list of grocery items no doubt referring to the selling off of the country.  The last line of the song proper refers to \\"deadly nightshade\\", which is a plant with hallucinogenic properties, allegedly used in witch's brews.  What it means escapes me, but it is interesting.<br /><br />The only weak spot is \\"More Fool Me\\" an insignificant but innocuous short tune.  It happens to be Phil Collin's official lead vocal debut (I'm quite certain he did the lead on \\"For Absent Friends\\" on \\"Nursery Cryme\\", but it's uncredited), but I'm not dumping on ol' Phil - I just don't care for the song.  It's not bad, just not up to par with the rest of the album.<br /><br />If you can't decide which of the 4 classic albums to buy first, this one is a good one to start with.  If you like this one, you will want the others:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000DP01 Nursery Cryme]]<br />[[ASIN:B000GW87NY Foxtrot]]<br />[[ASIN:B000002J1S The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]<br /><br />One interesting side point:<br />Genesis's first post-Gabriel album, [[ASIN:B000002J27 A Trick of the Tail]] (see my review), has many parallels with SEBP, from the cover color and artwork, to the similarity between the \\"pop ditties\\" on both albums (\\"I Know What I Like\\" and \\"Squonk\\"), The crime stories (\\"Epping Forest\\" & \\"Robbery Assault & Battery\\"), the long instrumental and refrain at the end, and some other similarities in the sound & feel of the two albums.  I have to think that all this was deliberate.  Clearly after Gabriel's departure, they had something to prove, and it is interesting that they chose SEBP, and not \\"Lamb\\", as the reference point.he did the lead on \\"For Absent Friends\\" on \\"Nursery Cryme\\", but it's uncredited), but I'm not dumping on ol' Phil - I just don't care for the song.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|Excellent film. The 1st time I watched this movie it was dubbed and with subtitles (which was a little distracting). You do NOT want to be distracted when watching this movie. Every detail is important to the plot. I think that you will enjoy this movie.
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|This CD is awesome!  I think it, along with the last CD shows how the Backstreet Boys have evolved from boy band to mature singers.

1400049628|5.0|Oh my goodness, I had no idea zombies were real; I thought they were just the stuff of fantasy and horror movies, but I was wrong. Max Brooks has opened up my eyes to the biggest threat this world has EVER faced, the threat of undead zombies roaming through the world and killing everyone. BEWARE!<br /><br />But there is hope my fellow humans. You don't have to be a victim of the zombie invasion. You can live, and this book will tell you how. In it you will learn about the deadly virus, Solanum, which attacks the human brain and turns it into a completely different organ altogether (don't worry; the book will explain it better). Although no trace of the Solanum virus has been found in nature, the search continues. As well as learning the basics of the virus you will also learn how to properly flee an infected zone, build adequate defenses, clear an area of zombies, and if need be live for years in a world ruled by the undead. What are the best weapons to use in a zombie invasion? What makes a motorcycle a better means of transportation then a truck? What types of terrain are preferable when on the run? How do you tell the difference between real zombies and voodoo zombies? All these questions and more are answered in this essential manual.<br /><br />Don't let yourself become another victim of the zombie menace, arm yourself with knowledge and the know how to defeat these evil creatures. I will be ready when the zombie invasion begins, will you?<br /><br />Re-read value; VERY high.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|The common consensus with fans seems to be that the third season of [[ASIN:B0017HZZP0 Lost]] is the weakest.  I have to, respectfully, disagree.    The genius writers and assorted crew behind \\"Lost\\" kept it fresh in the [[ASIN:B000FIMG68 second season]] by focusing most of the action around the mysterious hatch.  In the case of this season (the third), the main plot focuses on the conflict between the Oceanic survivors and the Others.  Finally, after two entire seasons shrouded in mystery, some of the big questions start to get answers.    + We learn how Ben came to be the leader of the Others  + We learn what happened to the Dharma Initiative  + We get a 'sort of' origin story for the Others  + We learn how Locke ended up in a wheelchair.    But that's not it.  This season has a tighter narrative than any of those previous.  While the flashbacks sometimes felt a bit contrived (especially the \\"how Jack got his tattoo\\" story), the main plots of each of these episodes tied very nicely in to each other, creating a very focused story-arc for this season.  Jack, Sawyer, Kate, Charlie, and Desmond get some great character development, while characters that seemed to be static (such as Hurley) start to play larger parts.  As with any show, there were story lines that I wasn't sure about (such as Locke becoming increasingly morally ambiguous), but the fact that I was constantly shocked and enthralled by this show is just a testament to how well-done it is.    Though the story is so continuous in \\"Lost\\" (particularly this season), it's hard to pick out the episodes that really stand out, but there are a few I thought really solidified this series as one of the best I've ever seen.  These are those episodes.    5. The Cost of Living: Tugs on your heartstrings, and opens up new questions.  4. Flashes Before Your Eyes: I was confused at the decision to make Desmond a permanent character, but this episode made him one of my favorites.  Tragic, revealing, and the essence of \\"Lost.\\"  3. Tricia Tanaka Is Dead: Nearly perfect. This episode solidifies Hurley as a great character, and shows the characters having fun, which is great to see in the middle of so much drama.  2. Greatest Hits: As a penultimate episode, it is a perfect example of how to build up tension for an explosive finale.  Also, it has the greatest usage of flashbacks (recounting the best moments of Charlie's life) in the series, until...  1. Through the Looking Glass: This two-part finale is a roller coaster ride that will keep you tense up (with tears in your eyes, because not everyone makes it out alive) until the shocking end.    This show is brilliant.  Simple as that.  At this point, I trust the \\"Lost\\" team with any path they want to take us down, because this season and the two previous ones are proof that the yarn they spin is golden.    10/10 Classic.

B000M4RG42|1.0|If you are looking for a movie about the tremendous sacrifice made by American servicemen in WWII who fought and died to preserve our freedom, forget this piece of revisionist, left-wing hollywood trash. (Fortunately, the copy I viewed was checked out at my local library, so I did not contribute to the wealth of Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg by buying it.) The battle scenes are very few and interspersed throughout the movie as flashbacks of memories of the main characters, the men who raised the US flag on Mt. Surabachi, or was it the second flag raised on Mt. Surabachi...whatever. As the movie slowly plods along, it tries to make a huge controversy over the men who were viewed as national heroes in an effort to sell bonds to support the war effort. My dad was a WWII veteran of the battle at Iwo Jima, and like most verterans, he rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, and he too would shun the title of \\"hero.\\" But the fact is, ALL of these American servicemen who put their lives on the line are our heros of our free country today; ALL who were in harm's way ran the risk of not returning alive. Yes, even though the men themselves shun the term, they were all heros to a proud nation. But the hollywood lefties just can't stomach that, or take any pride in the sacrifice these men made. The film is so wrong on so many accounts, such as when it says \\"a photograph can win or lose a war.\\" Bull...t!! The men who fight the war win the war! Another lie Eastwood & Spielberg would have us believe is that troops in the field are only willing to die for each other, their buddies. But from what veterans have told me firsthand, they knew they were fighting for a whole lot more, and were always cognizant that they were not only fighting for their buddies, but also their families, their homes, and yes, dare I say it, the country they loved. Of course, since hollywood lefties hate America, this is a point they dare not show in their revisionist propoganda films, and that is exactly what this film is. Hence, I give it a one star rating.tly what this film is. Hence, I give it a one star rating.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|There are so many things wrong with this film, its hard to pick where to start.  The Monster - I liked the monster, too bad the writers did'nt bother to provide any back story, origin, explanation, etc..    The Characters - A bunch of stupid, self-absorbed yuppies do not make very sympathetic central characters for a film. The main character is the worst of all; only someone named \\"Hud\\" would be stupid enough to go along with a guy trying to find his ex-girlfriend in the middle of a giant monster attack. I was waiting for him to say \\"I'll get my best friends to safety, but I will go back later for my ex-girlfriend, after I stop by the local hardware store and grab a few shotguns, some flashlights, some walkie talkies if anyone is coming with me, hardhats, maybe some climbing gear..\\", but that never happened.    The Scene in the Subway Tunnel - Try fighting a large animal with razor sharp claws and teeth, in the dark, with your bare hands. You will lose.    The Military - Wow. Did they even talk to ANYONE in the armed services before writing this screenplay. I was waiting for the AC-130H Spectre to show up (105mm Cannon,40mm and 25mm munitions) - the thing is DESIGNED to take out targets in an urban environment, from high up. Then there's the assortment of air/gas bombs and laser guided munitions that a fighter could carry. My jaw dropped to the floor when I saw infantry SHOOTING at this 10-story monster with M4s and AR-15s..RIFLES?? Then it dropped again when I saw a mobile howitzer (I think it was a M109A6 Paladin) shooting at the monster?? Hmm, let's see, I can deploy the Spectre with its 105mm Cannon or put troops on the ground with a mobile howitzer and its 155mm cannon - to get stepped on..Unbelievably stupid..    More Military Problems - Why would the evac chopper pilot fly low over a free fire zone directly across the monster's path?? That was completely stupid. This screenplay needed alot of work..    I say, don't bother watching this insult to human intelligence.

0790731509|5.0|Warner Home Video has announced the release of a new Deluxe Edition of Cool Hand Luke on standard DVD and Blu-ray, with new special features.  There will be a making-of featurette called \\"A Natural-Born World-Shaker: Making Cool Hand Luke,\\" which the press release describes as \\"an in-depth look at the creation of an uncompromising classic.\\"  There will also be an audio commentary with Paul Newman biographer Eric Lax, and the theatrical trailer.  Only the theatrical trailer and some text production notes are on the old DVD.<br /><br />Cool Hand Luke is the story of a man (Newman) who, by a minor offense combined with stubborn if at times casually guided will, gets himself into increasingly deep trouble in a tough Southern prison.  It's played as part comedy, part gritty drama.  Luke's cool, fearless, devil-may-care attitude and escapades make him an icon among his fellow prisoners, until he is brought to abject desperation, ultimately rising again and falling to become a legend.<br /><br />The film is famous for a hard-boiled egg eating contest and, especially, a quote that has entered the pantheon of movie quotes: \\"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\\"  The title character's nickname comes from another quote, made after he bluffs to win at poker: \\"sometimes nothin' can be a real cool hand,\\" a quote that has ironic punch in the context of the movie as a whole.  Newman was nominated for an Oscar, and George Kennedy won one for his supporting role.  Strother Martin is unforgettable as the twisted prison captain.<br /><br />I enjoy this movie, but I've never completely loved it the way many do.  Parts of it never seemed quite real to me (not \\"uncompromising\\" either), not with the truthful feel the similarly themed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has, for example.  But it is a classic, with memorable characters, scenes, and storyline.  I'd probably give it four or four and a half stars, but I'll round up for the new special features, which I look forward to.<br /><br />The new SD Deluxe Edition is [[ASIN:B0019UGYK0 here]].

Today Billing Precision is the fastest growing billing company for Chiropractors in the US and in just three short years has grabbed a significant portion of its' market.  Using the Good to Great principles Billing Precision has redefined how outsourced insurance billing and practice management software is used by chiropractors across the country.  I can honestly say that Jim Collins' work has made a huge impact on my business and I definitely recommend that everyone read this book.
1883217040|5.0|I'm a lifetime guitar player and have recorded and toured with a jazz band for the last five years.  I'm long past buying books on improving my playing;  not that I think I'm that good I've just not found that many that seemed to be worth the time.  Many offer ideas based on some gimmick such as learn only 5 scale patterns and you can be an expert at solos!  My experience has taught me that there is no substitute for practice and playing with great musicians!  However as my band has matured and we have become more classically jazz oriented there have been many occasions where I need a technical reference on jazz theory and just didn't have access to a good one.  A friend of mine who is a professional musician mentioned this book almost in passing and called it \\"The Bible\\" on the subject.  Well whatever you want to call it its great!  The author lays it all out in a very straightforward and logical approach that anyone with an interest in jazz and some basic experience can understand.  In addition, it's not just for guitar players.  Highly recommended!
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris has the enormous talent and knowledge to clearly write what atheists and agnostics think and feel.  He makes a strong case as to the  strong link among intolerance and religion, perhaps even pointing at a new way to understand history, and particularly war and murder.  Another venue of his clear presentation is the lack of evidence of the existence of god, any god.  Our societies have built enormours superstructures of thought based on no evidence whatsoever.  The consecuences are dire, limiting our abilities to create better more equal societies, and certainly less intolerant to others beliefs.  I think this book is a breakthough.

B0013FXWU6|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was deserving of the Academy Award he received for his portrayal of an intense, driven and obsessive oil man in \\"There Will Be Blood\\". The initial stages of the film are a mini-documentary of the dangerous, dirty and labor intensive process of drilling oil wells in early twentieth century California. Day-Lewis's character, Daniel Plainview, strives to become an oil tycoon using strong arm sales pitches to acquire land, relentless effort to drill wells and strategic vision in applying new pipeline technology to bypass the railroad monopoly and deliver his product to market. His nemesis is an equally ambitious pentecostal preacher who manipulates the simple townfolk that ranch the land above Plainview's oil fields. Ultimately both men are destoyed by their respective obsessions.    The flow of the film falters a little at the end. However, Day-Lewis's best performance of his career (surpassing strong performances in \\"The Age of Innocence\\" and \\"Gangs of New York\\") make this one of the best films of 2007.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|My only tip to someone who is looking to buy a blues CD is BUY THIS NOW!!!   This CD / DVD is the best thing I've heard and seen about the blues for a long time.   Kenny Wayne Sheppherd does a fantastic job on this in that he has a laid back approach when the old blues greats are playing and lets loose when they allow him to.   It was great to see him struggling to keep up with 91 yo Etta James on Knoxville Rag and playing second fiddle to BB King, Cootie Stark, Henry Townsend and others.   The cd is full of old songs with a new touch on them and the stripped back, yet full sound allows the guests on this cd to shine.   The production on this is fantastic and there is not one dull moment.   The DVD was also great, with the mixture of interviews and songs making it an educational experience for those who want to know what the blues is all about and getting a real sense of the music.   The only disappointment was that some songs were interrupted or cut short.   The concept for this project was something that should have been thought of long ago but hats off to KWS, Gerry Harrison, Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon for creating a masterpiece.

B0014DBZT2|4.0|Before the release of Grinderman, I remember getting all excited reading that Nick Cave was coming out with hard rocking album. Unfortunately, the CD didn't live up to my expectations, it struck me as more of a throwaway than a committed project. But at least I didn't have long to wait for the real goods. Dig Lazarus Dig is everything I had been hoping for in a rocking Nick Cave release, full-fledged songs, fun yet biting lyrics, a diversity of musical styles,  moments of pensiveness and beauty, and oh yeah, it really really jams. Welcome back, Nick!    I don't understand why some reviewers are knocking this album. This, to me, is not the sound of Nick Cave in a rut, this is the sound of Nick and the Bad Seeds revitalized. We all love Nick Cave the twisted balladeer, the lounge singer with the dark tortured soul of an Ingmar Bergman, the pensive Nick Cave of The Good Son, Murder Ballads, The Boatman's Call, No More Shall We Part and The Lyre of Orpheus/Abbatoir Blues, but staying in that same mode ad infinitum would have constituted the true rut. It was time for a change, and Lazarus indicates a deviation in focus I ardently applaud, even if it turns out to be for one album only. Nick's characteristic snarl is still here, but he seems to be having more fun this time around. Does that make some of the lyrics less deep than what we're accustomed to? Maybe, but that doesn't mean they're not every bit as intelligent and literate and black as before. Nick has opted for a more absurdist lyrical style on several of the songs, going off on bizarre tangents while spinning his characteristically sardonic narratives, and frankly I'm not always sure what the hell he's singing about, but the results are damned entertaining nonetheless. As for the musical element, I like the sound of Nick Cave cutting loose. This might be the closest thing to a party album that Nick and the Bad Seeds ever release, and it is appropriately raunchy, but that doesn't make it negligible.  The title song which opens the album, and We Call Upon the Author, positioned directly at the middle, and the closing More News From Nowhere are the key tracks here, setting the mood of theater of the absurd spontaneity, but they aren't necessarily the strongest. This is a hook-laden album, with Nick's pop sensibilities in full swing. In addition to those three songs, I really love Today's Lesson, Hold On To Yourself, Lie Down Here(& Be My Girl) and Midnight Man. Besides its melodic invention and lyrical, flamboyance, Lazarus has the added advantage of being far from a one note adventure; musical ideas abound. Night of the Lotus Eaters employs what sounds like a steel drum, Hold On To Yourself and Jesus Of the Moon are beautiful ballads in the tradition of his more recent albums, but with some musical twists(Hold On has a distinctly western twang), and Lie Down Here is a barroom sizzler, the kind of all out assault Nick and the boys haven't done for a while(not counting Grinderman), with an irresistible melody and a propulsive performance by the band. Lazarus might be Nick's most American album, with its nods to American music and its darkly comic examinations of American celebrity and culture.    Some may argue with Nick's change in direction, I find it exhilarating. To the naysayers, criticize this album if you must, but please don't accuse Nick Cave of getting stale. For me this album is a refreshing change of pace, with the emphasis on fresh.

0790729393|2.0|Because films are frequently the closest contact people have with certain subjects, one must look at how this film approaches a very real and socially escalating problem: \\"child abuse\\" (as well as the acknowledged, but never dealt with \\"spousal\\" and \\"familial abuses\\") and the consequences of such \\"abuse.\\"  Let me state for the record that even though I have taught numerous classes on this subject, and frequently in disagreement with my peers, I find it repulsive that we as a society and nation belittle reality with the term \\"abuse.\\"  It is my belief that there is nothing \\"abusive\\" about another person assaulting or terrorizing another person, and that it is demeaning, stigmatizing, stereotyping, and trivializing to say it is \\"abuse.\\"  Moreover, I would argue that it is a consequence of not recognizing that the story in the film is about assault and battery, and the terrorizing--not \\"abuse\\"-- of children (and others), that the makers and stars of the film were unsure how to present the story in more poignant and dramatic fashion.<br /><br />Despite one's position (\\"abuse\\" versus assault/terrorism) on the subject mater of the story, the script and theme of the film--which really is more about how to \\"deal\\" with the effects of such actions--can only be described as cynical and pessimistic at best; and, more realistically, illegal/morally corrupt and vigilantism.  Because, as far as I am concerned, what the film is about, when the movie ends, is that revenge is sweeter than either the victim's health or justice, let alone how to realistically deal with the problem.  That is, the film condones the notion that the \\"best\\" thing one can do as a victim is break the law themselves, exacting revenge on their perpetrators while maintaining the illusion they and others see: that nothing ever happened to them.  The failure of such an approach is alluded to at the end of the movie--two of the boys (victims) get killed acting out just as they were treated, and the two other boys become (depressed) lost and lonely in society.  BUT I question how evident this is to most viewers.  Indeed, my gut reaction to the film the first time I watched it was: \\"Yeah, that's how you deal with sicko child predators: kill them!\\"  AND this is the movies \\"undoing,\\" while it is also what gives the film a feel good dramatic effect on viewers.<br /><br />As a society, most people \\"feel good\\" when revenge--especially when concealed in the imagery of \\"justice\\"--is the conclusion of the story.  So what if the prosecutor broke numerous laws to lose the case; that a priest committed perjury (which is acceptable, apparently, since the president can do so without consequences); two \\"hardened\\" criminals--who essentially admitted to killing the guard (Kevin Bacon's character)--are found \\"innocent\\" of murder; and another man/guard is killed \\"street\\" style by a drug lord?  In a society that refuses to acknowledge the true nature of \\"abuse,\\" and therefore coddles said criminals (as well as allowing so called \\"abuse\\" to be used as an excuse for the victim's own criminal actions), people--myself at times, as well--need an outlet to feel like something is being done.<br /><br />Movies (and other media) such as \\"Sleepers\\" provide that relief; and in doing so, I think, conceive a dramatic and satisfying exposure to one of our greatest threats to social order, in the movie \\"Sleepers.\\"  As such, this allows the viewer to empathize with the characters and theme of \\"Sleeper,\\" and come away satisfied or really liking the movie.  I think \\"Sleepers\\" also allows the viewer to (incorrectly) believe that the problem is not as bad as it is, and that it is being dealt with by others.  As such, \\"Sleepers\\" essentially provides the viewer a sense that \\"Yes, 'abuse' is out there, but it is being dealt with by \\"someone\\" else; so who cares?\\"<br /><br />However, it also keeps the viewer from asking more important questions:  Does such revenge help the victims?  Does such revenge help prevent the problem?  Why are we as individuals so willing to view such violence and crime as nothing more than \\"abuse?\\"  How is child assault and terrorism (aka \\"abuse\\") effecting other people, in addition to the victims and perpetrators--that is, to what degree has this problem disrupted/destroyed families, relationships, jobs, beliefs, and other socio-cultural aspects of our lives?<br /><br />I purchased this movie based on two factors: the amazing cast and other reviews praising how well the film was made, glossing over the subject matter.  Unfortunately, the cast--for the most part--gave mediocre performances relative to their past portrayals in other films; although, collectively, they did well enough to keep the drama moving forward.  As such, \\"Sleepers\\" is an average movie, with an amazing cast of stars who, on the face of it, give solid performances; but really just \\"walk\\" their way through their scenes, being themselves.  But, then again, an average performance by Robert Deniro or Dustin Hoffman is often superior to a really great performance my lesser actors.<br /><br />Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

B00000FC5H|5.0|I had fairly high expectations for this CD and was not disappointed. I had always liked their songs I'd heard on the radio while growing up in the 70's and into the 80's, but don't consider myself a huge fan. I had one other hits collection of theirs - Best of Earth Wind and Fire Volume 1 - which I thought was pretty good, but am not familiar with other recordings they have done.   The liner notes included an informative overview of the history of the group including which members were involved in which recording, and the chart positions each single achieved.  I knew this CD included all of the songs I knew and liked, and several I was not familiar with. Serpentine Fire and Saturday Night are the two I like best of those I was not familiar with before I bought this disc. Gratitude and Mighty Mighty are not bad, although I don't like them as much as the others on the disc, but they do not ruin the overall flow of or enjoyment of the disc.  I would highly recommend this for any fans of Earth Wind and Fire who would like to get a superior single disc collection of the best known songs by one of the era defining groups of the 70's and 80's.

B000FVRACK|3.0|I like Rubinstein as much as the next guy or gal - but let's get serious here. Sorry to throw cold water, but people buying this should be aware just what they're getting, and it certainly isn't all top drawer Rubinstein. Rubinstein made endless great recordings. His earlier recording of the Saint-Saens was never the last word in this concerto,[[ASIN:B000QEIM4G Rubinstein Plays Saint-Saëns, Franck & Liszt [Hybrid SACD]]] and this DVD version - while quite literally Rubinstein's last word - is much less so. Rubinstein was a great pianist, but he also made some recordings that are less good, and even a few best left forgotten. If you've heard either the Saint Saens or the Grieg concertos performed live by a great pianist you'll wonder what's happening here. Rubinstein plays so slowly at times I was afraid his head was about ready to tumble forward into a nap. Previn rarely does much to bring any life to the somnambulistic proceedings.<br /><br />If Rubinstein had adopted such tempos in his forties and fifties I would question why he made such choices, but it would never cross my mind that it was due to his difficulties in playing the music. That IS how I see and hear some of this playing: I fear Rubinstein just can't attack the music at the speeds he once did, when he nonchalantly fire up the afterburners with a kickstarting giddy-up.<br /><br />I heard Rubinstein in concert - several times. His best playing had a snap crackle pop intensity and it's just not in much evidence here. At times it's just not there at all.<br /><br />I've known these particular Rubinstein performances since they were first issued on Laser - like all the other reviewers I bought them on sight. Unfortunately they were less than overwhelming. Many years later they remain just as slow and underwhelming - nothing has changed.<br /><br />You the buyer certainly are free to disregard my warnings - but caveat emptor. Sometimes strange things happen in Amazon reviews - and this DVD seems to me an example of a out of whack set of reviews.<br /><br />Let's enjoy Rubinstein in his prime at the pinnacle of his powers, and not over praise his playing near the end when he's showing clear signs of the batteries running down. To hear Rubinstein at his towering best try instead his album of Spanish music, made many years before this. No, it's not TV. Are you interested in the music or the image? If the music then his Spanish CD showcases infinitely better more vital music-making.<br /><br />And if your heart is set on hearing Rubinstein in a concerto this CD also includes a far better example of this great master in a concerto. Of course it's not even in stereo, let alone video, but it IS fabulous playing. [[ASIN:B000031WBO Rubinstein Collection, Vol. 18]] This Rubinstein performance I did give a full five stars review - if Amazon permitted more I would have given it a few more than five!<br /><br />Listen with your ears and your heart, too, not just your eyes.reviews.

B000929AJQ|1.0|Those of us who've followed this band since the inception are disgraced. However, there are two radio hits for those who love to chew bubblegum.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Casting Robert Downey Jr. ([[ASIN:0784011680 Chaplin]], [[ASIN:B000XCZGV8 Zodiac]]) in the title role turns out to be a masterstroke as the beleaguered actor slips easily into all the complexities of a brilliant scientist who also happens to be a billionaire industrialist and a hedonistic playboy whose every pleasure-seeking habit has turned into a death-defying addiction. The textured part of Tony Stark so mirrors Downey's former tabloid-headline-grabbing life that the actor can't help but inform the role with layers of resonance and irony that elevate what could have been a more cookie-cutter superhero epic. At the same time, director Jon Favreau ([[ASIN:B0002F6BRE Elf]], [[ASIN:B000DBHX4M Zathura]]) has more on his mind than creating another heavily stylized comic book myth, as he spends the first part of the film on establishing the realistic context for his hero's circumstances in rugged, war-torn terrain of Afghanistan. No less than four writers were recruited for the screenplay - Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway - on top of the original work by Stan Lee and his creative team at Marvel Comics. Usually having too many hands is a warning sign of a bad, neutralized movie but not this time - this is smart, provocative entertainment that doesn't forget it's also a popcorn flick with plenty of special effects, nonstop action and an unsubtle sense of good versus evil.<br /><br />The story has Stark, the head of his own multinational corporation specializing in the manufacture of state-of-the-art, mass destruction weaponry, in Afghanistan demonstrating a new guided missile that can launch a multitude of smaller missiles aimed at individual targets. His military convoy is ambushed by insurgents who kill the soldiers escorting him. Stark survives due to the quick-thinking ingenuity of a local Afghan physician who implants a device in Stark's chest to ensure the remaining shrapnel left in his body doesn't travel to his heart. Stark's captors demand that he build a missile like the one he just demonstrated, but instead, he makes an elaborate armored suit and blasts his way out of the cave where he was held hostage. Lots of carnage inevitably ensues, but Stark's miraculous escape sets the stage for the rest of the story. Transformed by his traumatic, three-month experience overseas, Stark has a change of heart which has detrimental ramifications on his company but also allows him to follow his monomaniacal pursuit of building a sleeker, more powerful version of the suit he built in captivity. Three people, in particular, are impacted by Stark's unpredictable actions - his military liaison and best friend Lt. Colonel Jim (\\"Rhodey\\") Rhodes; Stark's cagey second-in-command at Stark Industries, Obadiah Stone; and Stark's devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts.<br /><br />With impressive agility, the often underappreciated Downey makes Stark's transformation palpable and brings surprising conviction to a role that must have seemed absurd on paper. Favreau's other casting decisions also pay dividends though some more than others. Shorn of his thick hair and sporting a salt-and-pepper beard, Jeff Bridges, another actor who never seems to get his due, is still recognizable from his trademark grin and plays the avuncular, villainous Stone with great relish. Credit Bridges for not overdoing what could have been an excessive Willem Dafoe-like turn in the first [[ASIN:B00005JKCH Spider-Man]]. One suspects that Terrence Howard will have more to do in the sequel as Rhodey since he is not called on to do much in this first installment except provide support and official alibis. Playing the distressed female again after a similar role as Polly Perkins in Kerry Conran's [[ASIN:B0006IIPIK Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]], Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much more to play here as Pepper Potts, but she makes the most of a mostly observational role and effortlessly delivers some of the film's more amusing lines. All the production values are top-notch - as they have to be for this type of franchise - and special mention should be made of J. Michael Riva's elaborate production design (Stark's Malibu estate is quite an eye-catcher), Matthew Libatique's crisp cinematography, and the dozens involved with the seamless CGI effects. Make sure to stay after the credits in order to see a surprise final scene which gives a hint of what the sequel may be about.p-notch - as they have to be for this type of franchise - and special mention should be made of J.

B0012E6R3W|5.0|This is Testament. Formed in 1983 with Steve Souza singing originally known as The Legacy. Since the birth of American thrash back in the 80's Testament has been cranking out metal that was fast, intense and heavy yet melodic. 25 years later We are blessed with this masterpiece of an album. From the very get-go this album gets in the mood to rock. With crushing metal anthems like \\"More Than Meets the Eye\\" we see a brand new old band resurge with awesome  crafted guitar riffs that seem to punch the ear drums as if to say, \\"Don't call it a comeback!\\" Alex Scholnick and Eric Petereson's chops cannot be matched by many. They shine on this album as if they never missed a beat. \\"The Evil Has Landed' displays a sort of Practice What you Preach era. One of my favorite solos is on this song. The title track is probably the most intense song I've heard since \\"Of Dog Faced Gods\\" off Low. Killer breakdown and double-bass by Bostaph(a far better drummer than Tempesta). Do yourself a favor and don't drive listening to \\"The Persecuted Won't Forget\\". Your bound to want  to get a speeding ticket and possibly a bad case of road rage. \\"F.E.A.R. is one the most old-school songs I've heard them do in years. Sounds like maybe something off of The New Order. Very 80's type rock chorus with a fat solo break and dueling leads. All in all kiddies this band help influence and pave the way for bands like Shadows Fall, Avenged Sevenfold, The Absence,Trivium. So put this record and school yourself with some old-school metal
1401307450|4.0|For a TRUE RHCP fan, this book is riveting.  I read it the whole thing in one weekend, even while walking in the rain because I couldn't put it down.  Anthony shares the story of growing up a rebellious youth, mostly due to his irresponsible father, and evolving into the beloved singer of one of the greatest bands of all time.  He honestly addresses his very serious addiction to herion and coke and discusses how his girlfriends, like drugs, brought chaos and drama into his life.  In reading the book CAREFULLY, one is able to understand that this is a man who has owned up to his faults and tried to grow as a person.  He has learned that the only person he can control is himself, and that life is best if taken one day at a time. This story is about finding the beauty in what is given to us and helping others with what resources we have.  As a person who has loved the Peppers since the 80's, it was great to read Anthony's commentary about the songs that I have listened to for years.  I loved the book and would strongly recommend it.

1400032717|2.0|This book was introduced to me by several close friends, all of which \\"highly recommended\\" this novel as a \\"must read\\". This novel is a quick read, however frustrating and lead to a general feeling of disappointment. It certainly offers a unique perspective, however, I found the writing did very little to hold my interest. Too often throughout the novel, Christopher (the main character), simply provides a monotonous accounts regarding the events taking place around him or the conversations he holds with others in a manner that becomes grueling as well as irritating to read. An example if I may... \\"And then I said, \\"   \\"... and then father said. \\"     \\"....and then I said, \\"    \\"...and then father said, \\"      \\"......blah blah blah. Sometimes for entire pages a conversation was accounted for in this manner. Similarly, the accounts of events taking place around him written in this fashion.    Granted, I do understand that Mark Haddon had all intentions of writing this novel from the perspective of a 15 year-old autistic child and that is what makes this book both unique and interesting to read to most others who have read this book. All in all, I feel that Mark Haddon had accomplished what he set out to do by writing in this style, however, it simply did not interest me the way it did others whom I've spoken to about this book. The happenings within this novel appeard contrived, developed slowly and eventually lead to nothing. Upon completing the novel I simply said to myself, \\"...and that's it?!?!\\"
0345472322|2.0|The underlying principle of the book - that valuing hard work is ultimately a better motivator than valuing inherent ability - seems to be a sound one.  As another reviewer said, the problem with this book is that the author gets that across in the first chapter.  After that, it's example after example, anecdote after anecdote, hypothetical situation after hypothetical situation.  The only tool the author offers that would help you to bring this principle to your life, is basically \\"just do it\\".  Other than the repetition of \\"you should value this rather than that, because it works better,\\"  you get nothing but a conclusion.  I didn't find it that useful, even though I liked the underlying principle.
0064410935|5.0|Tracy M Griffin  May 10, 2008  Literature Review    Title:  \\"Charlotte's Web\\"  Author:  E.B. White  Publisher:  HarperCollins 1952  Pages:  192  Genre:  Children's  Reading Level:  4.9  Lexile:  680    Synopsis of the Plot:  \\"Charlotte's Web\\" is an endearing story about the friendship between animals and humans to save the life of a pig.  Wilber was born to a litter as the runt; Fern, a young girl who had a great love for animals, immediately took him in.  Fern was a child that had the gift of speaking to the animals.  Wilber lived on a farm that belonged to Fern's uncle, so she could see him and the other farm animals a great deal.  The other animals grew to be a large part of Wilber's life, especially Wilber's friend Charlotte.    Wilber met his good friend Charlotte in the barn.  Her first words to Wilber came at a time of need for Wilber.  Charlotte was a calm and collected spider.  She always had words of wisdom to Wilber, and had the ability to ease his always-tense self.  Charlotte would later become a lifesaver for her great friend Wilber.      When Wilber grew to know his surroundings a fear started that he was going to be slaughtered.  Wilber was so worried and insecure about his life he would fall faint a great deal and always be in a tizzy.  Wilber expressed his concern to everyone in the barn a great deal.  His best friend Charlotte decided to take a stance for her friend and help him get through this time.  Charlotte used her skill of weaving beautiful webs to show the family that owned the farm how great Wilber really was.      Negative Aspects of the Book:  As I have read this book many times I feel that the content now does not fit the reading level.  My students in first grade really enjoyed this book being read to them.  However, currently the sixth graders at my school are reading this book and I do not see them enjoying the book as much as my young students do.      Personal Appraisal:  This book was a joy to read with my students!  It gave thema clean and deep meaning of friendship and helping out people that we care about.  The language was very appropriate for any child to read.      This book helps students realize how much friends can really help out each other.  The relationship between Charlotte and Wilber is one that many children can relate to.  My students in my class found the way Charlotte was so calm and endearing to be somewhat of a mom to Wilber.  That was so interesting that they came away with it, I never thought of it that way, I always saw Charlotte as just a friend.  This book shows that there are many interpretations that can be made through literature.    The most worthwhile part of this book is the friendships that exist between Wilber and all his friends.  His friends show him how great of a pig he really is.  Fern's love for Wilber, even though he was the runt of the litter, shows students that no matter the size or makeup of someone they still are great!
1427201439|5.0|Dune is one of those intimidatingly long books that I'd always told myself that I should read but never got around to. What a mistake that was! Despite the length, the pace feels just right, and the characters are absolutely fascinating. The use of a third-person omniscient narrator really allows the reader to appreciate the political intricacies and strategic calculations that each character undertakes. At the completion, I found myself completely surprised that Dune was written in 1965 - it felt much newer and more modern to me. Well worth the effort.

B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I am a big Madonna fan. I have loved her music through the years, and recognize not only her talent, but her influence on music and pop culture. That being said, this has to be one of the weakest, most boring albums I have heard in years. Not just bad for Madonna, but bad music all aorund. I have tried repeatedly to listen to every song on this album, but cannot get more than a minute into each before I have lost all interest. It is painful to listen to, and painful to think that someone of Madonna's stature, with all of her resources, can't come up with a better attempt than this.    The music is lifeless, and feels quite dated. The songs seem to blur into all sounding the same.Vocally, it sounds as though the producers did not know how to treat Madonna's voice. It comes across as high-pitched, straining, and amateurish.    Quite frankly, if this album was done by anyone other than Madonna, it would've been panned by the critics, and would've been lost to music history as another flop.

1591841984|5.0|Inside Steve's Brain was a fun and fast read.  Author Leander Kahney did a fantastic job summarizing the thought processes Apple CEO Steve Jobs has gone through over the years.  Whether it was the start-up period with Woz, when Jobs got tossed out of his own company, his time building NeXT and his subsequent return to Apple, it's all covered here.  This is particularly remarkable given the small size of this book (less than 300 pages).<br /><br />I'm not an Apple fan but this is the second Jobs-related book I've read in the past several months.  The other one was Option$, the parody by Fake Steve Jobs.  While Option$ was more entertaining, of course, Kahney's book is quite engaging as well.  His writing style makes you feel you were right there in the garage, the office or the boardroom setting he's currently describing.<br /><br />Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:<br /><br />  British comedian Charlie Booker said...\\"If you truly believe you need to pick a mobile phone that 'says something' about your personality, don't bother.  You don't have a personality.  A mental illness, maybe -- but not a personality.\\"<br /><br />  Regarding Apple employees...Despite the zeal, employees are distinctly un-cultish.  They consciously avoid the cultish types.  At a job interview, the worst thing a prospective employee can say is: \\"I've always wanted to work at Apple,\\" or \\"I've always been a big fan.\\"<br /><br />  To explain why employees and coworkers put up with him (Jobs), critics invoke the Stockholm Syndrome.  His employees are captives who have fallen in love with their captor.<br /><br />  The (Apple) stores are insanely profitable.  One Apple store can make as much money as six other stores in the same mall combined -- and can pull in almost the same revenue as a big Best Buy store, but with only 10% of the floor space.<br /><br />  \\"We said, we want our stores to create an ownership experience for the customer,\\" explained (Apple's Ron) Johnson.  The store should be about the lifetime of the product, not the moment of the transaction.ent of the transaction.
B00012BSHG|5.0|I just bought this inflatable pool for my 23 month-old daughter and she absolutely loves it.  It was a cinch to inflate with the Intex 110-120 Volt A/C Quick Fill Electric Pump I bought to go with it.  It inflated completely in under 10 minutes.  The pool seems quite durable, as a matter of fact, my husband got in it with her yesterday and the two of them were splashing around for about an hour.  The only drawback I see is that the drainage hole is at the bottom of the pool, so when it is filled with water, I am not able to lift the side of the pool enough by myself to let the water drain out.  That is either a two person job or a job for one person strong enough to lift the side of the pool.

B00005MP58|4.0|This is one of the few book to movie productions I have seen that have actually got it right. Because it was a miniseries, they were able to put everything that was in Jane Austen's book into this film. Colin Firth is the best Mr. Darcy I have seen in a film. He gets the character so well, and was able to portray it truthfuly. All of the other actors did a great job too, and the locations in which everything was filmed was perfect. It is worth watching this over and over.
B00008IHN1|5.0|I attended a 100% African American High School, and the Band was fierce.  They looked good, sound good, and could get their dance on.  So the marching band was always a very important part of my life, even though I wasn't in the band.      During the summer, when they would practice, I would go to the football field and watch them get their routines and formations together.  In the movie, where the band members have to run around the track when one person messes up, I have witnessed numerous time.        During football season, the band would make a short appearance at the pep rally in the gym.  They would march in, high steppin, do a number or two, and high step on back out of the door.  The acoustics were fantastic.    During Mardi Gras, to see my marching band or any other of the two major black marching bands coming down the street was pure excitement.  We would pray that they would stop in front of us and play a song.     Everybody and dey mama would go to the foot games when we played against two of our rival black high schools, just to see who whupped butts on the field during half time.  We only considered each other as being real competition.  You know black folks got their own style and ways of during things. We are so unique and innovative.    In saying all of this, I enjoyed this movie for all the memories it brought back of the Black Marching Bands.  Yeah, when I was in high school, the only girls who could be majorettes were the \\"brick houses.\\"  You could not be fat or skinny.  You had to have back, a small waist, flat stomach, thick and shapely thighs and legs, and easy on the eyes.  The majorettes made the first impression, and it better be a good one.      To the folks complaining about the technical aspect and such, y'all it is a movie for entertainment.  It is not a documentary.  Anyway, how many tickets do you think such a movie would sell at commercial theatre  - nada! I respect your opinion though.

0767827902|5.0|This is just an amazing movie.  I saw it at the Dryden Theatre in Rochester, NY about 10 years ago and was just blown away.  Maybe it was dust and wind blowing up the small town Texas streets.  Two young men graduate from high school and struggle with becoming adults as they learn more about the adults in the community and their lives.  Larry McMurtry never wrote a better novel than this one nor had a book turned into a better film.  (Well, Hud is just as great I think.)  Peter Bogdanavich directed a classic film and Cybill Shepherd make a great debut as an actress.  Let's not forget Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges too.  The older actors are given roles of a lifetime - Ellen Burstyn, Cloris Leachman, Randy Quaid, Don Johnson and others.  A near perfect film of a wonderful novel.

B000WZAE1I|1.0|Nothing wrong with this DVD, but I could not believe that Robert de Niro or Michelle Pfeiffer would stoop so low as to do a children's movie, without warning the purchaser that it should be intended for pre-teens, even though the movie is PG-13, which baffles me totally.    I thank my seller for selling me, what I was too stupid to realize, should have read the reviews before I ordered this item! Woe is me!
B000GUJZ4G|5.0|This is one of the best action/adventure movies ever filmed! It's a *lot* more believable than say, Iron Man, Spider Man, Super Man, etc., or anything featuring \\"Bond, James Bond.\\"     Why did they give it a rough time when it first came out? It was directed by a \\"woman, very talented woman,\\" and people were not about to let the sacred domain of the Summer Blockbuster Movie be shared with a woman!  She had been romantically linked with James Cameron, so critics, of course, archly hinted that he did it for her, etc.     I recommended it to friends at the time, and told them it was so vivid, that in the surfer scenes you'll need a towel! They didn't go see it. Months later, when it was out on cable, they came up to me and said, \\"I have this great movie to recommend - you've got to see it!\\" I explained that it was the same movie I'd tried to bodily drag them to. They were shocked - \\"But this was a *good* movie!\\" Yes. That's what happens when you let your life be decided by critics.     It's got much more heart, and a much better story, than most summer blockbusters you'll ever see (or a lot of other movies, either). Not to be missed! Great all-around cast, pulse-pounding action, memorable lines, and -- remember your towel.

B00001U0E1|5.0|Who but Stoppard would think - or dare - to make a movie about the creative impulse itself? Why and how we transmute our experiences and express them in art, is the most exciting theme of this magnificent movie. Along the way he spoofs show business, creativity vs. money, and romance. There's the pageantry of the period piece, the sometimes slapstick humor, the love story, the tragedy, the \\"the show must go on\\" triumph, and most of all a reverence and wonder for the impulse that makes us spin all our trials and triumphs into gold.     With Stoppard, as always, you get an almost frightening attention to detail - there's never a wasted second in his work. For instance, there are several close-ups of Will's hands, which are stained as dirty as a field-hand's with ink: word-smithing, like blacksmithing, is hard and dirty work.     And the entire piece is crafted like one of Shakespeare's plays: there are many levels to appreciate, but he never forgets to \\"play to the pit\\" -- to have lofty and earthy moments, something for everyone.
1400079179|1.0|It's one thing to write blasphemous trash. But couldn't the author have gotten his history straight during the four years he claims to have researched the book? Dan Brown made up the story of a Pope who ran around emasculating statues. There is no record of any such event. Okay, it's a work of fiction, but what's the point of libeling a good man?<br /><br />In his acknowledgements, Brown refers to his mother, not his father, as his \\"role model.\\" His protagonist, Robert Langdon, is an equally manly \\"man.\\"<br /><br />This is the stupidest book by the stupidest author alive unless he's written something even stupider. I have no interest in finding out.
0307265730|5.0|In the prologue of this book is a quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne that is simply astonishing in its disasporal beauty: \\"Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil. My children have had other birthplaces, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.\\" And so begins this collection of equally astonishing short stories by Lahiri. As much as I enjoyed her first collection of short stories (Interpreter of Maladies), I was rather put off by her next novel: The Namesake. I felt that the latter was a depressing and foreboding warning against seeking out unknown lands and new adventures. But maybe I was mistaken, maybe Ms. Lahiri is, in fact, celebrating this diasporic journey. The short stories she has weaved in this book are perfect. The characters are so well developed that you feel a sense of loss when the story is done. The first few stories are self contained, and the last three are tied together; all written with Ms. Lahiri's precise sense on how to complete a sentence in the most descriptive way using the least amount of words. In the last set of stories, Ms. Lahiri uses the guise of fiction crossing over into real world calamities as the protagonist perishes in the 2004 Asian Tsunami (this literature device when used wisely is strikingly creative -- Nelson DeMille was the first author I read who used it in Night Fall; in his case, 9/11 being the profound event.) As is usually the case with Ms. Lahiri, the stories in this book are centered around the Eastern US seaboard, with Calcutta providing the anchor that roots the character's lives once they seek their fortunes in unaccustomed earths. This book was simply fantastic. I cannot recommend it highly enough!
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|This movie falls flat from an unbearably generic plot as well as a thinly veiled attempt to cover its complete lack of creative thought or depth with special effects and an attempt at artistic quality that only goes so far as, \\"Say it with more accent,\\" and \\"What if we gave the whole film a sepia tone to make it seem more 'historic?'\\"<br /><br />There are reasons that we go to see magicians in person rather than simply watch them on TV; one of the biggest being that nothing is really amazing when it could just as easily have been done with TV special effects.  This sums up pretty much every trick in The Illusionist.  There are no real magic tricks here, and subsequently no explanation for how the 'tricks' really work (though the movie pretends there are.)  This is because the tricks don't actually work; they're \\"movie magic\\" masquerading for the real thing.<br /><br />The love story is a rehashed, \\"she's rich, he's poor, the world doesn't understand,\\" sort of thing.  There's no real romantic chemistry, so they cover it up with a bare leg sex montage.  The character development is done mostly through voice-over narration.  You'll never see the final twist coming because it's so contrived.<br /><br />There's a reason this movie was released in theaters a little over a month before The Prestige.  Once you've seen that undoubtedly superior film The Illusionist becomes almost unwatchable.  I gave it a second star because as bad as it is, I've sadly seen much worse things come out of Hollywood recently.

0805079831|5.0|This book is important, excellent and deeply moving. I think it's best read as an account of the origins of neoliberalism plus an inventory of the ways that neoliberal governments have undemocratically imposed unpopular, harmful economic \\"reforms\\" over the angry objections of their populations. Since almost all our politicians are neoliberals now, and since most Americans don't know what neoliberalism is (amazon.com's spell checker claims it's not even a word), this book should be widely read, though it may not be. It tells the story of the rise of the world's reigning economic ideology, and Klein zeroes in on what is perhaps that ideology's greatest contradiction: while neoliberals extol freedom of choice, populations that are free to choose reject neoliberalism. Thus, in a succinct, poignant and accurate formulation of Eduardo Galeano's that Klein repeatedly quotes, \\"People were in prison so that prices could be free.\\" However, I found Klein's thesis-type thing, the parallels she draws between electroshock therapy and economic shock therapy, shocks to the body and shocks to the body politic, to be shallow and unconvincing. It's an analogy, not an analysis. With that said, Klein gave me a clearer understanding of the ANC's sellout than I had after studying abroad in South Africa, and her first 128 pages is the most powerful and moving passage of political writing I've ever read. So get it, read it and think about it: this is the history of the present.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|In the two albums before Bill Berry retired from R.E.M., the band had begun working on its harder rock side, seen best in the mid-1980s albums Lifes Rich Pageant and Document. 1994's Monster was...well, give the band credit for stepping out of its comfort zone. New Adventures in Hi-Fi from 1996 met with more considerable success, with a rawer sound based in large part on songs written, performed, and recorded while on tour. But once Berry called it a day, the band retreated to its original signature strengths...tuneful midtempo ballads and upbeat songs with inscrutable lyrics. Trouble is, the band did sound incomplete, struggling to perform well in the studio, and those strengths were blunted, resulting in what may be the weakest era in R.E.M.'s history.    No more. Accelerate is a wildly dynamic, loud, in-your-face album that barely lets up during its short, punk-like duration. It's one of the best and most fun albums R.E.M. has ever released. Looser, rawer, and harder than Monster or New Adventures, with political statements that rival those on Document, these are songs that just scream to be heard in arenas...even more so than those on Green. It's all too easy to imagine screams of delight echoing off the bleachers with the opening chords of \\"Living Well Is The Best Revenge\\" and \\"Supernatural Superserious.\\"    And man, does the band sound like it's back in its groove and enjoying itself again. Michael Stipe sings \\"Wow!\\" during each of the first three songs (well, it's actually \\"now\\" during \\"Living Well,\\" but in his enthusiasm, it could just as well be \\"wow\\"), and ends the album with a triumphant \\"Yeah!\\" The title song is a fast and furious romp, filled with angst and adrenaline and Peter Buck's ragged power chords, with no hint of the Byrdsian jangle that used to be the band's calling card. (The song is such a letter-perfect copy of Led Zeppelin's \\"Achilles' Last Stand,\\" though, that the band might do good to prepare against a copyright lawsuit.)    Accelerate isa fighting album, with verbal attacks all over the place (\\"Nature abhors a vacuum, but what's between your ears?\\" \\"You're forgiven for a narrow lack of vision\\" \\"You weakened shill!\\"), but in its quieter, pensive moments, the band reveals what can result from such aggression. The title of \\"Hollow Man\\" speaks for itself. Stipe pleads, \\"Believe in me, believe in nothing/Corner me and make me something...I'm emptied out, I'm incomplete.\\" During the somber \\"Until the Day is Done,\\" with funeral drums and dry, rustic guitar that recalls The Band, a resigned Stipe sings, \\"The battle's been lost, the war is not won,\\" and leaves very little room for hope, despite the tuneful accompaniment. In contrast, the harsher \\"Houston\\" eloquently pits hope against hope from the eyes of a Katrina victim: \\"So a man's put to task and challenges/I was taught to hold my head high/Collect what is mine/Make the best of what today has.\\"    And about that closing song: \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" is one of the most unlikely R.E.M. songs ever made. Utterly tuneless, with no real music line, some of the most vapid lyrics the band has ever written, and an obnoxious singalong tagline: \\"I'm gonna DJ at the end of the WOOOOOORLD!\\" But somehow, the song is utterly contagious, a punk free-for-all where so many wrongs make an ineffable right. It's also a brilliant flip-off to those who didn't think R.E.M. had it in them anymore...a perfect closer to an album that should stand as the most triumphant album R.E.M. has ever made.

He gave some mumbo-jumbo answer that it was basically because of America's \\"collective pain\\". What a bunch of malarky. Obama went to that church to get himself some \\"street cred\\".

David Attenborough has been the narrator for many different BBC programs and he is is my all time favorite narrator by far, and the visuals are perfect, you can think of many different animals that were not included - but that would have taken forever and the ones that they choose were really good.  The interviews with the cameramen and producers were good to.  Perfect for the family, nature buff, classroom, anything.

Wilbur was so worried and insecure about his life he would fall faint a great deal and always be in a tizzy.  Wilbur expressed his concern to everyone in the barn a great deal.  His best friend Charlotte decided to take a stance for her friend and help him get through this time.  Charlotte used her skill of weaving beautiful webs to show the family that owned the farm how great Wilbur really was.      Negative Aspects of the Book:  As I have read this book many times I feel that the content now does not fit the reading level.  My students in first grade really enjoyed this book being read to them.  However, currently the sixth graders at my school are reading this book and I do not see them enjoying the book as much as my young students do.      Personal Appraisal:  This book was a joy to read with my students!  It gave thema clean and deep meaning of friendship and helping out people that we care about.  The language was very appropriate for any child to read.      This book helps students realize how much friends can really help out each other.  The relationship between Charlotte and Wilbur is one that many children can relate to.  My students in my class found the way Charlotte was so calm and endearing to be somewhat of a mom to Wilbur.  That was so interesting that they came away with it, I never thought of it that way, I always saw Charlotte as just a friend.  This book shows that there are many interpretations that can be made through literature.    The most worthwhile part of this book is the friendships that exist between Wilbur and all his friends.  His friends show him how great of a pig he really is.  Fern's love for Wilbur, even though he was the runt of the litter, shows students that no matter the size or makeup of someone they still are great!
B0011HOEY4|4.0|The Black Godfather in a manner of speaking. This is based on a true story and it is gritty and great. Good job casting and directing and production is amazing. Sets and costumes will take you from 1960s to 1990s. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe give stand out performances as a gangster and a clean cop. You will see Denzel's character rise from a driver that respects his boss to an all powerful leader. You will see as he goes from twenty thousand to over two-hundred and fifty million. He brings his large family from South Carolina and sets them all up in the business. Although it may seem a little long in parts it is a good drama. If you enjoy movies like \\"The Godfather\\" or \\"Donnie Brasco\\", you will probably enjoy this movie. Good quality DVD with decent replayability.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like the instructor.  She's not interested in flashy outfits, make up, etc.  She's there to make you sweat and she does a good job keeping you from quitting.  The workout circuits are the problem for me, though.  These are all the same basic exercises you've done since jr. high school P.E..  The music is very drab.  I need for my workout to be fun or I start to get lazy.  I couldn't wait for this workout to end so that I could jump into a more active workout.<br /><br />Still, this DVD deserves the 4 stars for being effective in it's purpose...  to make you lose weight and tone muscle.
0061205699|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee is a call to 1960s American society to take action in the Civil Rights Movement. This is the story of a young, white girl in a small 1930s Southern town. She grows up learning from her father, the town lawyer, appointed to defend an innocent black man accused of the rape of a white girl. The author depicts the reality of injustice and prejudice in everyday life at the time. This timeless classic portrays racism, segregation, and the need for the Civil Rights Movement in a deeply moving novel, which is a must-read for all.   Lee takes a stand for Civil Rights in To Kill A Mockingbird, portraying the hate and injustice of segregation. She tells how an innocent man is absurdely accused of rape, solely because he is black. Atticus Finch, the accused's lawyer, clearly proves that his client is innocent, but the all white jury still rules Tom Robinson (the accused) guilty as charged. This page-turning novel calls attention to the need for acceptance, tolerance, and desegregation.    Atticus Finch was looked down upon for defending an African American, but he taught his children, as Lee teaches her readers, to stand up for what is right. Harper When asked why he was defending Tom Robinson, Finch replied, \\"if I didn't I couldn't hold up my head\\". Written in the 1960s, this book is a call to conscience as powerful as the marchers in the street, the sitters in the restaurants, the pioneers in the courtrooms, and the oppressed all over the country.     by: Cierra Campbell, Zoe Kurtz, Leah Ragen, Lila Weintraub, Selena Wyborski
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I just don't get all the harsh reviews because I love this CD. While it's certainly not Madonna's best, it's a fitting cap to her 11 albums with Warner, and I hear a touch of all her past 10 albums on this one. From the bubble-gum pop (Heartbeat) to more the intelligent and complex (Devil Would'nt Recognize You) but the whole thing flows so fluidly, it almost feels like a mini-journey of what Madonna has been all about.<br /><br />If you're a true fan of Madonna's (like me. I mean this lady IS my Diva and has been since I was 19 when I bought her very first CD), you'll love this album. If you're a snooty music snob with little room to bend, then you should probably pass.

0609610570|4.0|As the title suggests, the book focuses on execution. Bossidy states that there are oodles of books on strategy, but there are precious few on Execution - thus his reason for writing the book, along with the advisor to CEOs, Ram Charan. After all, the best strategy in the world isn't worth a dime unless it is actually put in place.    The format of the book is simple and direct. First Bossidy defines execution. One definition he uses is great - the systematic way of exposing reality and acting on it. So many organizations come up with grand strategies that are based on unrealistic assumptions and/or they completely gloss over how the strategies are to be accomplished.     The book then discusses the three building blocks of execution to include Seven Essential Leadership Behaviors, Creating a framework for changing the culture of an organization, and having the right people in the right place.    The authors go on to describe the 3 essential processes required for execution: People, Strategy, and Operations. They describe how to set up each process in detail.    Several themes are echoed throughout the book to include...    * The need for robust dialogue, not only to get to the truth, but to be used as a teaching/learning tool.  * The intimate involvement of the executive in all facets of execution, to include follow up.  * The importance of linking the people, strategy, and operations processes together.    One of the flaws of the book, which is similar with many others that seek real world examples, is that no sooner does the book go to print than one of the exalted companies tanks.     With that said, there is a lot to be learned from this one. Bossidy is a pupil of Jack Welch, and that no-nonsense style is apparent. Many of the themes are the same, but some are indeed different or enhanced.    If your company is struggling, this book can help point you in the right direction. There is no miracle cure. You will need to take the medicine, but you will be better off for doing so.    -- Nick McCormick, Author, [[ASIN:0977981339 Lead Well and Prosper: 15 Successful Strategies for Becoming a Good Manager]]
B00004RD54|5.0|This is one of my two favorite live rock albums (the other is Stand In the Fire by Warren Zevon).  This is probably the best live rock album ever.  The guitar work is amazing.  The energy is explosive.  This is what rock and roll should be.  Two guitars, bass and drums and four guys playing their guts out (OK, there are keyboards too.)<br /><br />This live version of Heroin, all by itself, should get Lou (as a solo artist) inducted into the R&R Hall of Fame.  My favorite live rock track of all time.  It's a lesson in how to build up a rock song to a screaming crescendo.<br /><br />Like everyone, my only beef with the record was:  not enough, give us more!  This release includes two additional tracks from the same concert:  How Do You Think It Feels and Caroline Says I, which are also great and fit right in.  The remastered sound is excellent.  This release, unlike to old release on CD, has some nice liner notes.  Enjoy.
B000YAA68C|3.0|There are some funny and touching moments to the movie.  I had a hard time believing Swank in this role though.  She just didn't seem to fit.      Overall it was a decent movie.  It was worth watching.
B00005JN0T|3.0|Cliches reign in this 'Who the hell is Asimov?' sci-fi flick that poses the question 'how many unnecessary camera moves can we do in one fx shot?'. Rock out with some of my favorites:<br /><br />1. Open on a drowning scene involving our hero, which gets explained in flashback through the movie to the main reflection character.<br />2. The hero is a cop who lives alone but visits his 'heart of gold' grandmother in order to show his family's died, he's a loner, or just give us an excuse for dialog.<br />3. Hero actually says to sidekick 'We're not so different, you and I.' (Hero has a robot arm, presumably so he felt some degree of sympathy in an early draft of the script that got trashed.)<br />4. Hardened but good-natured black cop boss (oh for the 70s) actually says to hero 'Give me your badge'.<br />5. In classic B-movie/Outer Limits style, the world's biggest company is run by one evil man and about 3 other people. And - of course - he's not evil after all.<br /><br />Bridget Whatever-her-name-is couldn't act her way out of a paper bag; even James Cromwell looks embarrassed as a hologram. Some of the parallels with slavery and genocide are overworked and unneeded.<br /><br />But it has a couple of enjoyable sequences even though the robots look fake now (they looked good at the time). Btw, 'I am Legend' has continued the trend where we get to hang out with Smith in his undies while he works out, admires his own body, listens to music and showers because he's just *that* cool.
1591841984|4.0|Sure, there are repetitions, brochure-like language, and the sense of magazine articles being pasted together in this book. But the latter parts: the creation and the naming of the iPod, the Sony situation, proprietary vs. open-standards, etc., make this book worth reading.
0757307272|5.0|I highly recommend the book for ALL teens! After applying the strategies in their lives, teens have transformed their dreams into reality. I know the ideas works and have countless stories of the power of these princples. The book is great for teens trying to figure out life and for teens who already DREAM BIG! This book is also great for English classrooms, Leadership and Psychology classes, Student Councils and any teen leadership programs! Imagine a world where teens undestand the power of their thoughts and their feelings as they take action and create their dreams! Our World's Future is Bright!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Although I had to fast forward through the war and riots after the first time I saw ATU, I proceeded to watch it five times in four days (a first for me). And now I'll buy it. While I did, in fact, live through the events portrayed (and recognize the obvious, sad parallels to the world we're living in today), in the interest of full disclosure, I'm a HUGE fan of the genre, so my review is skewed! \\"All That Jazz\\" is my second favorite movie of all time and this one sweetly surpasses the hallucinatory aspects of that classic. On a personal level, the voices and faces of the young stars reflect faces and stories I knew in the day, so it's a bittersweet but beautiful trip back to the times that made me who I am. It allows me to feel like the young hippie chick I was so long ago, but mellowed (and, gratefully, strengthened) with the wisdom of age. Why buy it? Buy it to watch Jim Sturgess sing \\"Girl\\". Buy it to cry through \\"Let it Be\\" if you've got ANY unresolved issues. Buy it to fall in love with Sturgess, Fuchs, Woods, Anderson and McCoy like you did with George, John, Paul and Ringo. Sweet dreams!
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|This may be a \\"musical exclamation point\\", as the blurb for the album claims, but it is also an album with lyrics which sound like they were written by a third-grader -- repetitive, simplistic and just plain dull.  The album is expertly produced, but you cannot expect anything else from someone with Madonna's experience and moolah.  The content is instantly forgettable, and that is too bad for a woman who has produced such brilliant music in the past.  Perhaps it's time for Madonna to hang it up and focus on her new film production career instead.  The aforementioned moolah should at least mean that she can do whatever she wants there.
B000EXZI14|5.0|This recording is better in quality than their greatest hits album! I highly recommend it!
6304696515|5.0|Fantastic film.  Manages to convey the tone of the original book better than other versions.  Casting is unexpected, but John Malkovich is brilliant, as is Glenn Close.  (Uma Thurman is just strange as Cecile.)
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am so impressed with this series.  If anyone likes American history in the slightest, they will enjoy this series.  The acting is outstanding.  The protrayal of characters, including the costuming, make-up and dialects, is extremely good.  I particularly enjoyed (in addition to John and Abigail Adams) George Washington and John Quincy Adams.  Parts 2 and 4 are exceptional -- The series gets a little slow in 5 and 6 but are paramount in supporting the remarkable concluding part 7.  Is this a perfect series?  No, but it is the best portrayal of John Adams that I have ever seen.

B00003CWPL|5.0|Shortly after finishing `Eraserhead' I told my wife that I feel like a different person.  The film, strange as it is, is one of the most incredibly complete films I have ever seen.  It is truly a film about vision and mood and director David Lynch creates the perfect mood for his fantastic vision.  There is so much debate about the meaning of this film and I think that is what will essentially immortalize the film as one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever filmed.  David Lynch has stated that he has yet to read an interpretation of the film that matches his thoughts upon penning it (he even claims that he cannot remember writing the script) and I feel that he will take the films meaning to his grave.  I personally hope he does, for if I knew what to think of this movie then maybe I'd stop thinking about it.  The mere fact that I have no idea what this movie is meant to mean moves me to consider it over and over and over again.<br /><br />The film, shot in vignettes of strange dream sequences and nightmarish realities, follows Henry Spencer (I just love the hair) as he embarks on fatherhood.  You see Henry and his girlfriend Mary haven't spoken in some time.  He wrongly draws the conclusion that she has severed things with him when in actuality she has been giving birth to their child.  She breaks this news to him over dinner with her eccentric parents.  Forced to marry her, Henry soon finds his apartment filled with the dreadful screams of their new baby who just so happens to be a reptilian monster.  When Mary cannot take the stress of motherhood she returns to her parent's home, leaving Henry to care for the creature alone.<br /><br />This is really the best way to describe the plot, although the film veers off into Henry's head to create subplots and storylines that deserve our examination.  There is the strangely deformed woman who lives in the radiator who sings to Henry and appears to bring him some comfort.  There is the beautiful woman who lives across the hall who apparently has feelings for Henry and eventually works her way into his bedroom.  There is the `Man in the Planet' and the repeated appearance of umbilical cords that all lead me to my personal conclusion of the films message.<br /><br />David Lynch has claimed that this film is about all the fears and anxieties he faced in Philadelphia while attending the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.  In all honestly this helps boast my interpretation.  I feel that `Eraserhead' is Lynch's answer to mans ingrown fear of commitment.  Henry would rather consider his relationship over than pick up the phone and call Mary.  The depiction of the baby as a monster seems to draw on mans fear of fatherhood; the biggest and most important commitment one can make.  There is a scene where the lady in the radiator, while singing and dancing, squashes falling umbilical cords with her feet, to me symbolizing the need for man to sever the cord and be independent and free.  The advances of the beautiful neighbor also impress mans desire for freedom, casting aside the restraints of marriage for a fling.  The man in the planet could serve to represent many things, but looking at his appearance and demeanor I lean towards the idea that this man represents mans disinterest in physical labor; work.  Henry himself is on vacation from his own job as a printer.<br /><br />Then again, I firmly believe that this interpretation is wrong; it cannot be this simple.<br /><br />There is a pivotal scene within `Eraserhead' where Henry's head is used to create eraserheads for pencils.  This scene is obviously where the films name is derived from, but it is also the scene that baffles me the most.  It could be an obvious stab at the fact that our brains retain information, thus we can use them to erase what we don't like, but I don't think that `obvious' works in any sense for this movie.  This scene is probably the scene that, if identified, would reveal Lynch's thoughts on this film and it's moral.<br /><br />The acting in `Eraserhead' is flawless when you consider the type of film this is.  Jack Nance gives one of my favorite male performances as Henry Spencer.  His nervousness is key to creating the mood that Lynch establishes with the film, and if he had dropped the ball then the film would have sunk.  Charlotte Stewart is insanely effective as Mary, but it's Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates that really make the most of their small roles.  The dinner scene alone is one of the most memorable scenes in the film when it comes to performances, and Bates steals that whole scene with her domineering mother.  Her performance is yet another reason I fall towards the whole `commitment' theory, her character truly proving to be the horrendous wifely stereotype of dominance.  Joseph is great as Mr. X, Mary's father.  His performance is manic and commanding.  Judith Roberts is leering and Laurel Near is entrancing, both actresses embodying their performances magnificently.<br /><br />Lynch is the true star here though, delivering a rich and fulfilling film that is unlike anything else you've ever seen.  The films rich black and white delivery, not to mention the machinelike score, completely engulf the film and add layers to the feeling, the mood, the structure and construction of this flawless film.<br /><br />Sure, no one may really know what it all means, but half the brilliance in `Eraserhead' is that very fact.  It is a blessed unknown, a riddle that one must try to crack fully aware that they never will.  Lynch has created a masterpiece, a creative gem that will serve as one of a kind; a film never to be repeated.  `Eraserhead', whether you want to admit it or not, may very well be the greatest film of all time.  Like poet Charles Bukowski stated, after `Eraserhead' there is nothing; \\"starting with `Eraserhead' we sit here, click, click, click - nothing.\\"<br /><br />How very true.less when you consider the type of film this is.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|If only the minutes you had to endure to get to midnight while listening to this album were worth a few minutes, this may be a feasible album. Their attempts to completely lose their rap-technologic-rock came crashing down as a big mistake with this album. Songs like \\"Given Up\\" and \\"Bleed it Out\\" are sorry excuses for a high-school garage band with their clap tracks and simple repeating lyrics that hold no substance. \\"Shadow of the Day\\" sounds like it could be Kelly Clarkson's next hit and \\"What I've Done\\" is like pretty pop music with an angry voice. \\"Leave it All Out\\" reminds me of some sort of talent show attempt with two people singing simple harmonies while \\"Hand Held High\\" is a political crybaby song that seems to be made by Fort Minor, not LP. \\"no More Sorrow\\" is Linkin Park's attempt to sound like AFI apparently, with a beat that doesn't suit them and the random yelling in the chorus that's off tune. \\"valentine's Day\\" and \\"In Between\\"...I don't know what to say about these ones...just awful.<br /><br />All in all, if you like Linkin Park because you listened to Reanimation or Meteora or Hybrid Theory...you'll hate this CD. It holds no substance, but instead attempts to include influences like Taking Back Sunday and AFI with some Pink and random pop. They lost their edge and for that I will forever be saddened by this disc.
0385338724|2.0|I have now read all of Sophie Kinsella's books.  She is truly one of my favorite authors.  Can You Keep A Secret is one of my favorite books of all time.  I also thoroughly enjoyed most of the Shopaholic books.  Remember Me?  is not one of my favorites, unfortunately.  I didn't think the dialogue wasn't as witty as her previous books.  It was a very quick read (which I love) but I kept waiting for it to get more interesting.  I did appreciate how the heroine wasn't as dumbwitted as the heroine in The Undomestic Goddess.  I couldn't wait until this book was released...in fact I purchased it instead of borrowing it from the library like I do for most books....but sadly, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.
B0013J30XG|3.0|Okay folks, this one's going to be a dozy; let's talk about \\"Speed Racer,\\" the new film based off the 60's anime which is being directed by the Wachowski brothers (of \\"The Matrix\\" fame).  This is going to be a tough one because this movie walks a very fine line between \\"high octane fun\\" and \\"pretty crap.\\"  I mean that in a good way.  If you've ever seen the Speed Racer cartoon you may have an image of poorly animated races with poorly dubbed dialog in your mind.  You may also have in mind that the cartoon was about a kid who was a race car driver, his family who were mechanics, and their pet monkey Chim-Chim.  Well take that image and imagine it as a live action movie, and the movie would pretty much look as you imagined it would.<br /><br />Well, except for the fact that the movie is animated better.  The story...well, the story doesn't matter really.  It's about how Speed (Emile Hirsch), distraught over how his brother, Rex (Scott Porter), died in a race several years earlier, has now become a top notch racer in his own right and now faces having to deal with sponsors.  A sponsor makes a deal with Speed, but feeling that having a sponsor sponsoring him would betray how he feels about the sport, turns it down.  The sponsor warns Speed that every race, including the Grand Prix races, have all been fixed because the point of racing is to make stock prices go up.  Or, you know, something like that.  Anyway, like I said, all this is pretty much no big deal.<br /><br />The only time the story itself takes off is during scenes where the story ever emotionally involves the viewer is during the scenes where the family discusses the impact Rex's death had on the whole family.  Most particularly this is where Pops (played excellently by John Goodman) provides the movie with it's most emotional scene.  Eh, but what am I talking about.  Kids won't care about Rex's death.  They won't care about Speed's issues with sponsorship, they won't care about his relationship with girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci making her first family film in years), or the fact that Susan Sarandon is getting so few roles that she has to settle for making \\"Speed Racer.\\"  Nah, I'm sure the kids will care most about the car races.  Where Speed races in ice caverns, over volcanos, and these race track loops that look like they were built to KILL people with!<br /><br />The movie is all at once colorful, loud, and frenetic.  Many swirling colors shaded my view after this film was over.  It's pure cotton candy, and the Wachowski brothers prove that they are visual masters regardless of what color pallette they decide to use.  Yet the film also tends to provide a bit too much sugar at times, as the movie is almost non-stop insanity that goes on for more then two hours.  It's enough to make you wish it would slow down, and when it does slow down you wish it would start back up again.  Those who see this film in IMAX would do wise to bring a barf bag.  Visual and story aside though, I'm going to go on a limb and say the movies greatest strength is that the movie takes itself seriously and doesn't go for any inside jokes.<br /><br />Once you start making inside jokes the movie starts to steer towards being camp, but \\"Speed Racer\\" takes it's material seriously enough so that you never get this feeling that the actors are winking at the camera.  It feels really odd knowing how (at least fundamentally) stupid this film really is.  Still though, the directors are clearly fans of the work, the actors seemed to have fun with their roles, and therefor I had fun at this movie.  And I know I'm going to regret saying this in the morning, but I really do love that monkey.<br /><br />Rating: *** starsristina Ricci making her first family film in years), or the fact that Susan Sarandon is getting so few roles that she has to settle for making \\"Speed Racer.\\"  Nah, I'm sure the kids will care most about the car races.

B0000AUHPK|5.0|Lots of people watch or read Wuthering Heights expecting a grand love story. It is NOT a love story; anything but!<br />It's a story of obsession, revenge and destruction, and finally of rebirth in the next generation. (Remind anybody of Tess of the D'Urbervilles? It should.)<br />This is an excellent film version. I watched it over twice in the same sitting. (And, I've read the book.)You could hardly imagine a more sinister tale better told than this. The main characters' utter devotion to their own little world at the thoughtless expense of all else comes through loud and clear.<br />I'm buying this DVD today to help my daughter better understand the themes of her next high school English assignment & I will have her watch it when she's finished the book; I have no doubt she will enjoy it. And I will enjoy watching it yet again!

B0013J30XG|4.0|Remember back when you were a kid, and either you or one of your siblings got a Hot wheel racetrack for Christmas? Remember watching those little metal cars zip around on the track and trying to imagine what it would be like to be inside one? Speed Race gives you the opportunity.      The Wachowski brothers follow up their massively successful Matrix Trilogy, with Speed Racer. This time the story is PG-rated and appeals to children ages 7-11, but do not let that scare you away! It is enormously entertaining and the most fun I have had at the movies in a long time.      Speed Racer follows the story of a teenage boy Speed (Emile Hirsch), a born racer, who has just become extremely popular after winning a big race. His popularity has caught the eye of Royalton (Roger Allam), the owner and CEO of a gazillion dollar corporate conglomerate, who is bent on signing Speed onto his team of race car drivers. When Speed refuses to sign with him, Royalton goes about trying to destroy Speed's life as well as his parents (John Goodman, Susan Sarandon). Speed, feeling responsible decides to fight back; and to do this he must...yes you guessed it...RACE! The plot has many more intricacies to it but I will leave that for you to discover when you see it.      The casting was perfect, and everyone played their part flawlessly. John Goodman stood out the most as the passionate father, and relatively new Paulie Litt made quite an impression as Speed's younger brother.      Yes, the script and delivery of some of the lines were rather sappy, and there were the moments of that warm fuzzy-wuzzy father-son-family time; all which could be annoying in other circumstances but here they actually almost suited it.      Speed Racer does not disappoint and surprises you with how much you are drawn into it! The shots of the racer's POV, make you feel like you are on a theme park ride and take you back to your childhood--in a good way!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have been doing BeachBody's Turbo Jam for almost a year and thought I needed a change and purchased this.  I consider myself \\"fit\\" both in my cardio and strenth training - so I jumped into level 2.  It is a tough workout and as Jillian says \\"if you only want to work out for 20 minutes, a tough 20 it will be\\" and she is correct. However, the reason I didn't like it - it was too harsh for me - and the dropping to the floor doing pushups and then quickly standing up, were too much for my head - it gave me a headache.  I prefer Turbo Jam or Hip Hop abs which have better music and much more fun.  If you are looking for a hard, quick workout - give it a try.  If you want to work out and have fun - try Turbo Jam (even my husband likes it).

I had my nose in this book for over a week - just couldn't tear myself away....now what do I do??

B000UD08HW|5.0|Great Blu-ray dvd sound is excellent video is good. If you are a Pink Floyd fan this is \\"A Must Have!\\" dvd, great soundtrack.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|The nuiansces in this release are compelling enough to not catch everything in a couple listening sessions.  My favorites on this piece are the last 2 tracks, but In the Presence of Enemies Part 2 almost requires IPE part 1 (especially since they like to play these together in concert).  This album gets as heavy as their Train and Awake albums, but theatrical and thematic like Six Degrees and Scenes from a Memory.  This album is great snapshot of their capabilities.<br /><br />I want to giver 4.5 - 5 stars but there are some vocal snippets that just didnt sound right.  Given that, the work is masterfully done and encompasses rich textures, deep lyrics, great musical theme development, wild contrasts, and superb muscianship!
184195392X|4.0|What holds up in this book, and allows it to rise above the simple \\"gotcha!\\" at its conclusion, is that at its heart it concerns the interwoven relationship between fiction and reality. It is about how fiction (in broad terms, a \\"lie\\") can become one's salvation from reality. And doesn't that spark some interesting commentary on religion?? A wonderful fable, made better by its refusal to become too pedantic.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Every song on the album rocks! The bleeding is only the beginning, check out the Devils Own and Salvation. These guys are the reason I am going to the Mayhem festival this summer!

B000001FRY|5.0|U2-Boy *****<br /><br />Hardly the band they would become but still amazing. If anything the boys from Dublin seemed to have more heart back then opposed to modern times. Maybe not more heart, but certainly more angst. More of a punk band than the rest of the groups releases, and yet their is hardly anything to call political or socially conscious here, it's just the album feels more honest than any of the bands other offerings, more true, more angry, more passionate than anything the band ever released. Now don't get me wrong I not saying this is U2's best album, it isn't but it truly is one of their top albums.<br /><br />For a debut they knew what they were doing. 'I Will Follow' stands out among all other songs the band released, even with 'One' from Achtung Baby, and 'With Or Without You' from The Joshua Tree. The religious rocker is nothing short of stellar! Truly one of the bands lost gems. 'Out Of Control' rocks just as hard as anything the band ever released. 'A Day Without Me' is spacey and slightly on the verge of A Flock Of Seagulls with it's very new wave feel, but is saved by Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton's rhythm section. 'Shadows And Tall Trees' closes the album with a hint of what was to come, leaving fans wanting more, as all closing tracks should do, and that is saying a lot because it is the weakest song on the album.<br /><br />The Edge hadn't totally found his sound yet as a guitar player, and Bono hadn't really found his \\"Godly voice\\" as his name suggest and his lyrics weren't as imperative to the bands music but I still cannot give this album less than five stars in good faith. The heart in this album is unmatched by just about everything that would come in the following decade of disposable music, and for that I have to give Boy a five star rating and a massive recommendation to anyone interested.
0634049011|4.0|I bought Sololow's Fretboard Roadmaps, the Fretboard Logic SE book, and this workbook at about the same time. Of the three, this one was the most useful and best written. It would be even better if they released a software version so you could \\"drill\\" practice on the patterns. But for $15 I think this is a great resource and should be one of the first 5 things new guitarists put in their \\"library\\".<br /><br />Update 2011 -- Since my purchase of this workbook, I have added basically ALL of Barrett Tagliarino's books to my guitar library, and a 2nd copy of this workbook.
0765350386|5.0|I am a big fan of Robert Jordan, George R.R. Martin, and the like, and I originally got this book because Sanderson is writing the rest of Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  I was not disappointed.  As a matter of fact, I was pleasantly and unexpectedly engrossed, entertained, and addicted.  The book is hilarious (I laughed out load many times), fast paced, focused, and well developed in its characters, plots, and themes.  I expected some good reading, but what I got was a riveting, funny, real story that I am very excited to follow.  I only hope I won't have to wait too long between books to continue my new found adventure.
B00154GEFU|4.0|Go seize the day, wake up and say,  This is an extraordinary life.  Enjoy today, come what may,  This is an extraordinary life.  This is actually the chorus from the first \\"single\\" from a fantastic new album by Asia. Yes, that Asia; Heat of the Moment, The Smile Has Left Your Eyes and all that. These guys are back, in more ways than one. First of all, the original four members are back together for the first time since 1983. There have been Asia albums since then, with lineups that included from one to three of the original four. None of those efforts were as good as the first two albums (or this one). As a huge Asia fan, the 2006-7 reunion tour and this album were exciting news to me. I've never seen the original four live (I saw Geoff Downes and Steve Howe's version in 1992), and I've yet to see John Wetton or Carl Palmer live. I have seen the DVD of the 06-07 tour, and it is incredible. Hey, these guys have all been in the bands that were the foundations of progressive rock: Yes, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, and UK. Their pedigree couldn't be any better. They are career musicians who have been making great music for years with various bands or doing solo work. And I've bought a pile of their collective albums and CDs over the years.  Oh, I also said they are back in more ways than one. After conquering years of alcoholism, singer/bassist John Wetton was hit last year with emergency heart bypass surgery. Also, Carl Palmer had some heart surgery. Hey, like many of us, these guys are getting old. It was time for a tune-up. But they're back on the road again, performing to sell-out crowds across North and South America, Europe, and Japan.   I have listened to An Extraordinary Life DAILY in the two weeks I've had this CD. It has become one my favorite tracks of all time. This is a great song. The musicianship is out of this world. Like him or not, Steve Howe and his guitar can create a soundscape unequalled by anyone else during his 40 years in the music business. Geoff Downes' keyboards are at once both harmonic and melodic, and well suited as the filler in the gaps between the vocals and guitar. Downes has successfully plied his trade while playing everything from pop (Video Killed the Radio Star) to heavy prog (Yes' Drama album) and radio friendly rock (Heat of the Moment). And the vocals; at 58, John Wetton has a set of pipes that any singer would die to have. Age has added additional richness and color to his voice, while compromising none of his range. When I listen to the lyrics of this song (And yes, you can hear them and understand every word.) I hear Wetton's life. Knowing his story, I hear the change, the rebirth, the recent setback, and the pure optimism that comes from another chance, and his faith coming through.
B0012BUX0I|5.0|Let me start by thank Triad Productions for this great production of one of the greatest movies of all time.    I want to remind people of the world that there are only a hand full of basic stories in existence. The rest of the stories are diverse versions of these basic hand full of plots. It's what makes Shakespeare a Classic... and the rest of those great artists.     The concepts of betrayal, loyalty, love, and death. Money and murder etc.     Rashomon has a plot of this magnitude, and for the time, this film is amazing. The scenes are amazing!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Very tightly produced. Bare straight-forward plot. \\"Unknown\\" type characters (even though we get names and some background). I'm not a fan of gore so I appreciated the fact that except for a scene involving a military medical set-up many extreme occurences were implied rather than shown (thus the PG-13 rating).  Less is more sometimes and I hope that more producers recognize that some audiences appreciate that. For fans who want a little more \\"show\\" and tell, \\"The Mist\\" (now on DVD) produces tight action and tense background (and some blood and guts). Camera-work in \\"Cloverfield\\" is really all over the place (which is part of the scenario) but if you can get past that, it opens for a brief entertaining movie.
B000002UVX|5.0|Jimi Hendrix-Band Of Gypsys *****<br /><br />Complete with ex-Electric Flag drummer Buddy Miles and old army buddy Billy Cox on bass and the man himself Jimi Hendrix on guitar at a loose New Years Eve concert at Bill Graham's Fillmore East jam Band Of Gypsys is the essential Hendrix recording, as well as his best.<br /><br />The rhythm section of Miles and Cox is in my opinion better than that of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Also I must say, that to me this is the best Hendrix ever played, nothing I have ever heard from him on any other release even comes close to this, maybe 'Voodoo Child (Slight Return)' from Electric Ladyland comes close but nothing else. His songwriting is also amazing here. I am not going to say it is better then on his other recordings though because I feel that Jimi was an amazing songwriter his entire career.<br /><br />'Who Knows' kicks things off on this blues-fusion album and does so greatly. 'Machine Gun' is perhaps the greatest thing Hendrix ever did. The guitar work is breathtaking, and the Vietnam conscious lyrics are heartfelt. Buddy Miles' 'Changes' is killer. The guitar and vocal work is some of the best and most raw blues ever recorded. 'Power To Love' and 'Message To Love' go hand in hand and should only be listened to back to back in succession. 'We Got To Live Together' closes the album and does so with a bang. The group vocals really get the message of the song across, and Hendrix's guitar sound on this track is head scratching, and Cox's bass playing on this track owns anything by the Experience.<br /><br />Band Of Gypsys was Hendrix's anti-celebrity album. He wanted to get away from the showmanship of his earlier recordings and performances because he and his black audience felt it was demeaning much like it was for the fantastic Louis Armstrong. I think he achieved what he set out to with Band Of Gypsys and so much more. This is a fantastic record that should be heard by everyone.

B0009LNRLE|2.0|Introduced to \\"Yeti\\" through my intense fascination with Can, I emerged from this experience in utter disappointment. With the foreknowledge of how unique experimental music from the seventies can be, I did not expect \\"Yeti\\" to be remotely like Can, even though they are both dubbed as \\"Krautrock\\", but I did expect such a revered avant-garde band to be able to do more than tastelessly bang away on their instruments.<br /><br />As far as compositional skills go, the members of Amon Duul II are seriously lacking. Though the listener can catch a glimpse of an interesting melody occasionally slithering up through the sonic mess, it generally disappears as quickly as it surfaced to be replaced by talentless noise. There are no songs or sections that are remotely moving. As a musician, it is particularly excruciating to listen to such awful instrumental performances. Though this album is improvisational in nature and mistakes should be expected, it is painfully clear that none of the members are more than amature musicians. As far as vocals go... well... just listen to the pathetic attempt at an operatic vibrato on \\"Archangels Thunderbird\\".<br /><br />To my ears, \\"Yeti\\" does nothing more than mock the experimental nature of the early seventies.  If this album was recorded with the intention of being a sincere, timeless, progressive anomaly, I am sickened.<br /><br />Interesting? No. Accomplished? Certainly not. Listenable? Not at all. Worth your money? Probably not.
0736063684|4.0|I think this is a good book to supplement a bodybuilding book collection but is not a primary source on how to do gym exercises, but will give you additional ideas and information not found in other sources. The presentation is excellent and the design is superb. You will rarely find an exercise book that looks as amazing as this one and certainly it is a must for any bodybuilding/sport collection. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />However this is not a primary book on how to do the exercises, but if you know how to do the exercises then this book will come as a huge bonus to your routine. What this book is really good at is illustrating muscles in action, contractions and extensions. It really is an astonishing anatomy book that covers the kinetics very well. I have often picked up this book and flicked through the pages to give me some extra pep before I go to the gym and that is really what it is for.<br /><br />It is quite a thin book though in comparison to many bodybuilding books but that is because it is light on text and heavy on illustrations. I think it complements a collection perfectly but isn't a beginner's book.

0143038419|4.0|\\"...to give a true account...\\"<br />Henry David Thoreau<br /><br /> In one corner of my writing desk sits a well-worn copy of a book called The Day with Yoga. This small volume is filled with meditations, organized by days of the week, and represents the voices of philosophers and sages from West to East. Over the years I have read and reread these meditations to keep me on the path, my path, or, like the father and son in Cormac McCarthy's latest novel, on The Road; and like that father and child, I believe I am also \\"carrying the fire,\\" that thing that hums with mystery (McCarthy). (Certainly not a task for the faint of heart, which should explain the weathered nature of the yoga book.) I will remind myself from time to time of the words of one particular meditation from this book of yoga and particularly when I am struggling, which is often. It reads: \\"Learning is like rowing upstream. If you make no progress, you drift back.\\" These words have become a sort of pole star for me, something of value to steer by, or row by as the metaphor goes. I have had a similar experience with Elizabeth Gilbert's \\"search for everything,\\" which she so thoughtfully and thoroughly condensed for us, her readers, into this book of pleasure, devotion, and gratitude. I, for one, am most grateful to Gilbert for reminding me that prayer was meant to be joyful, not to mention participatory. Indeed. What better way of keeping our sense of humor about our human failings than to remember during our sincerest efforts at devotion to smile, as Ketut Liyer, Gilbert's wise Balinese medicine man advises, \\"even in (our) liver.\\" Amen!<br /><br /> That's the sort of medicine I can swallow. Go ahead, call me a chump. But a big fat smile is the one picture I repeatedly have taught my language students to hold in their heads when words fail them, and words fail us all sometimes, and sometimes not often enough. So while Ketut reminds us that the universe will respond to our smiling livers, Gilbert wants us to know that it will also listen to a plea for help. She takes us traveling with her, through three very different countries and into one lonely miserable night on a cold tile bathroom floor, so that we might see what could be as plain as the freckle on our arm that we have to be persistent in manifesting our own blessings. The search for contentment: It's ours. But sometimes we're going to have to go out, grab it, and drag it home with us (where we can get a better look at it). And sometimes the best thing to do is to go back to bed where once in a while, after a good sleep, reason does prevail.<br /><br /> At a time when the memoir is much maligned, I want to believe that Gilbert succeeded here in this volume in knowing how, as Emerson had once hoped for the diary or autobiography \\"to choose among what (she) calls (her) experiences that which is really (her) experience.\\" I am afraid that we, as a reading public, are becoming like the young Natalie Wood in the classic Christmas movie Miracle on 34th Street, willing only to express our \\"I believe\\" with half-hearted sincerity. So when Gilbert confesses that she recognizes the path of a writer to be one \\"for the courageous and the faithful,\\" I am going to hope that in writing this book she, unlike James Frey, was brave enough to look into her own eyes.will also listen to a plea for help.

I have never seen all of Miss Potter's work in one place, with all her illustrations so perfectly recreated and the background of Miss Potters life included with each story . The book is bound chronologically, and is so sweet. After I devoured the book I realized what a perfect nursery gift it would be, and took it to my favorite grandchild; she can learn to read and share the book with her younger siblings! How lovely is that!
B00006AUIG|4.0|one of the most effectively scary films I have ever seen, (and I love horror movies). This movie doesn't rely on blood and gore as such, but rather psychological tension for its thrills.<br /><br />Good performances by David Caruso and Josh Lucas anchor this film and keep it realistic and believable. If you enjoyed \\"The Ring\\" and its atmospheric doom, then you'll enjoy this.  Best watched with all the lights off in your house.
6304696566|2.0|This is a very enjoyable Western because it has the essential elements of great leading man, John Wayne, and great genre director, John Ford.  Jeffery Hunter was also very good here although my all-time favourite role of his comes much later and just before his untimely death as Capt. Christopher Pike of the Starship Enterprise.  I have always thought that of all the captains of the Enterprise, although his tenure was the briefest, he was the best actor of the lot.<br /><br />This film though has one of the most breathtaking scenery ever and makes full use of the colour medium to produce optimal results.  Monument Valley was an inspired locale to shoot this film and although the screenplay isn't the best with some awkward moments especially in the clumsy attempts at interjecting humour at various points that just didn't quite take, this is more than made up for with great camera work and great acting.  John Wayne is very convincing as a bigoted and racist bitter Confederate soldier who takes surrender and losing very hard who over the course of the film learns from Jeffery Hunter and his own observations to change his world view and becomes compassionate and less bigoted in the end.<br /><br />Overall, this is still although not a perfect picture a very, very good representative of the Western genre and like a true classic bears up well to repeated viewing.<br /><br />The only problem is with this version of the DVD which is very shabbily put together and is very poor.  The picture quality is terrible having not been restored and white spots and other imperfections abound on both sides i.e. Standard and pseudo-Widescreen versions although the few short documentaries on the bonus features were okay.  The only redeeming factor which warrants 2 stars is the excellent sound quality that comes in Dolby Digital and is clear and at a nice consistent volume level throughout.  Certainly one of the best dvds of an older film sound quality wise that I've seen.<br /><br />I notice that a Blu-ray version of this film has been released and as I haven't seen it, I hope that that version would have addressed the issues I brought up above.  My recommendation is to give this version a miss and check out the hopefully vastly improved picture quality of the Blu-ray version or wait for a much better improved standard version with a properly done widescreen format to become available.  Just give this dvd version a very, very wide berth.this film has been released and as I haven't seen it, I hope that that version would have addressed the issues I brought up above.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|I bought Season 2 before I'd even seen all the episodes. How much higher of a recommendation can I give? This show just keeps getting better and better. The story arc is intense and emotional, but there's enough humor and action to make it fun to watch. The only downside for me is a lack of an ongoing love interest. I really thought it would happen with Dean and Jo. I thought they had a great chemistry, but alas nothing came of it. Anyway, buy Season 1 and 2- you won't regret it.

0060752610|5.0|This book is hailed, and with strong reason, as one of the cornerstone pieces of investment literature. The ideas surrounding valuation and the like are as valid now as they were when the pen first touched this masterpiece.     It is not one of those over-hyped, over-produced get rich quick in the stock market type pieces, but rather a solidified educational fundamental foundation to theory of value investing.    A warning to the novice: This book is written in a very technical language that will be hard to grasp without an understanding of the market in general. This should not be a first investment book, but rather a compliment to your growing collection.
B00140PK6O|5.0|2008's \\"Cranford\\" is an outstanding Masterpiece Theater presentation, featuring a superb cast of actors set in a small village in the Midlands of 1840 England.  At the center of the story is a group of single females led by the aging spinster sisters Miss Deborah and Miss Mattie, their younger niece Mary Smith, and Miss Pole, who collectively contribute both wisdom and humor to the story.<br /><br />Cranford manages to contain considerable human interest despite its small size, or perhaps because of it.  Rumors run wild, normally well ahead of the well-intentions efforts of villagers to get things done.  Several themes thread through the series.  One theme is the influence over village affairs exercised by the spinsters.  A second is the assimilation of the young Doctor Harrison, who causes quite a stir by his unorthodox medical methods and by his good looks.  A third is the pending disruption to the insular ways of Cranford by the advent of a railroad across the lands of the wealthy Lady Ludlow.<br /><br />A number of charming subplots enliven each episode, which pull no punches when it comes to matters of love and death.  Small romances thrive or fail.  A estate steward teaches a gypsy boy how to read.  The village enjoys an annual party on the estate of Lady Ludlow.  A bank failure threatens a woman with sudden destitution.  A couple in love are kept apart by her family obligations.  Valentine's Day becomes a source of confusion as mysterious cards arrive at varous homes in the village.  Even prominent characters are not immune from disappointment, although there is hope from episode to episode that fate will be kind to most.  Period costumes, customs and furnishings are spot-on.  The direction keeps the story moving from family to family as the various themes are advanced.  The final episode is absolutely thrilling, as a variety of plot threads are finally tied up and surprising heroes save the day.<br /><br />\\"Cranford\\" is very highly recommended as excellent entertainment to fans of Elizabeth Gaskell's novels and of Masterpiece Theater.Elizabeth Gaskell's novels and of Masterpiece Theater.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I rented a few episodes of Supernatural thinking that it might be okay. I was greatly surprised to find it more than okay. Much more. The premise is interesting and the creatures they fight are fleshed out nicely in each episode. It's genuinely scary, but rises far above simple horror entertainment. The characters are three dimensional, with issues and emotions that seem very real in spite of the fantastical context of the series. The chemistry between Ackles and Padalecki is excellent. They play so well off each other, you'd swear they were brothers in real life too. There's a lot of fun, witty banter and great pop culture references. The music is awesome and perfectly matches the ambience of the show. It pretty much has everything I'm looking for in a series- action, drama, and humor. The only thing it lacks is romance. There's a few one episode love interests but I'd rather see something more ongoing. But that's a minor quibble and I can understand how fitting in a long term romance would be difficult given the way the show's layed out. Anyway, I highly recommend this series. I bought the first and second season without even having seen all the episodes!

B000001ESF|5.0|I recently found a copy of \\"2112\\" in the local CVS pharmacy, I just wanted to get some sinus medicine (chronic sinus problems), and snooped around at the merchandise in the front of the store while awaiting my turn at the register. I got nostalgic and picked it up, and bought it with the sinus pills.<br /><br />Critics of compact discs say they lack the depth and warmth of the old records, scratches and \\"fireplace\\" noises notwithstanding. And, to a degree, I agree with them. But not in this case. It was remastered, as every old record issued on CD is remastered, but the sound is beautifully recaptured, and the performance, as well as the overall sound, is incredible. It is really surprising, how \\"BIG\\" this sounds. I have made the same observation with George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass.\\" It's hard to explain, but the sound is simply huge. Some people, the ones fortunate enough to think and ideate with the right side of the brain, can experience something more than just sound, even though the medium is simply in sound. But look at the way the cover looks. The dark, warm colors, against a mostly black background, convey something more than just the experience of listening to a top-notch progressive hard-rock band(even though blue and white are actually very cold colors, the scheme is warm). I foolishly shunned this and other Rush records for a long time, mostly over certain people in my life who idolized them, one even trying to \\"sing\\" like Geddy Lee. I can't call this \\"singing\\" per se, but his voice is ideal for what they do, even though it is more of a screech. Some people, you just just want to be as opposite them as possible. But, we're all adults now.<br /><br />The cold, impersonal situation of a recording studio often pervades a recording when tons of overdubs are used, but sometimes, the fire of the piece comes through, as it does here. The first half of \\"2112,\\" the title peice, is a suite of selections that tell a story, set 306 (my mathematical error) years into the future (this was originally released in 1976), where the government and church are fused as one; a frightening, deadly combination, where, apparently music has been banished (Joe's Garage, anyone?) from public life. The complexity of the music and libretto are belied by the story itself, but narrations are included in the libretto with the lyrics, and this keeps the intellectual level above some one-act story with no depth. It is a short story, but, in the fashion of Pink Floyd, atmosphere is maintained with sound effects, although kept to a minmum. The strange, other-worldly noises in the beginning put the listener into a Science-Fiction setting, but sounds of waterfalls and such compliment the music, and help tell the story, and link the individual pieces together. By the end, it seems to degenerate into some Star Trek dialogue, but \\"Trekkies,\\" I doubt would listen to Rush in the first place. Maybe they do, I just doubt it.<br /><br />The second half is more varied, with shorter selections, not necessarily related, but they still put this band's talent on display. It's a real shame, a crying shame even, that Pop Culture has drifted away from this kind of material. Yes, bands from those days still tour, and they still draw big crowds, but a lot of younger people have been denied the experience of popular acts releasing a record such as this and doing a tour behind it.<br /><br />Call me an \\"Old Fart,\\" maybe I am, but I just can't put material like this in the past, where some say it belongs.

B0011NVC9I|2.0|[[ASIN:B0011NVC9I Beowulf (Unrated Director's Cut)]]  I didn't know this would be an animated film, but it was a good one.

B000A59PMO|5.0|Three dimensional characters, a complex story arc and witty dialogue make this show a joy to watch. Although somewhat implausible, nonetheless great fun. Kristen Bell is great as the title character and as far as mysteries go, I wasn't able to predict the ending. Definitely check it out, it's well worth the time.
0312323867|5.0|4.5 stars.  I did read Something Borrowed a couple of years ago and enjoyed the tale-even though I didn't like Rachel any better than I liked Darcy.  Darcy, though very self centered and clueless, in my opinion was wronged by Rachel.  You DON'T sleep with your best friend's fiance-period.  Plus, I never thought Dex was worth the trouble any way.  Still, the book is a page turner because you just can't believe someone is THIS clueless.  But then I have to co-sign what another reviewer mentioned.  There is a decrepency in this book being written in first person (Darcy's P.O.V) and what is actually being said.  It doesn't match.  The narrator is clearly smarter than the actual character.  It worked for Something Borrowed because Rachel was supposedly smart.  Darcy is supposedly like Jessica Simpson, but surprisingly (in narration) has an impressive vocabulary.  Around the time Darcy decides to start being a better person, the book started to feel long.  But over all I think the two books are definitely entertaining-though the women in these books need serious counseling.

The only way they could have previewed all the great scenes for you would be to just run the movie.  Great movie, great acting, great action and special-effects.  The only reason I did not give it all stars is because I don't think such a movie exists.  If it did, I would've been so excited that I would've had a heart attack and not been able to write this review.  This is a must buy.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I own Seasons 1 & 2 already and I know I'm going to be watching them repeatedly until I can get my hands on Season 3. It's torture to wait! This show has swiftly become a favourite of mine- right up there with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly. I don't usually watch TV- instead I wait for the DVDs before getting into a series. The only shows I've actually watched while they were on TV are Buffy, Firefly and Supernatural.
0307387178|5.0|John Krakauer's book got over 1,100 comments at Amazon.com and was made into a recent movie, so the story of Chris McCandless' death in the Alaska wilderness interests many.    I connect with the story in several ways, as follows:    1)  A difficult father/son and inter-family dynamic can propel a young man on an outward \\"heroic journey.\\" After college I moved 1500 miles from home partly from this desire to find an independent place apart from my extended family.    2) Young people often desire a taxing travel journey as a means to self discovery. I've known many young people who took extended solo trips and my own cross-country journey from after college was this kind of journey that included the desire for new experiences and risks.    3)  The long-distance runner is accustomed to enduring pain in pursuit of victory. McCandless was a hard-core competitive runner who relished the challenge of enduring the accompanying pain in cross-country running. He refused to accept necessary survival equipment people offered him partly because he wanted to do things the hard way. Having run cross-country and track, I can relate to this \\"no pain, no gain\\" impulse.    4) The individual who confronts wild natural beauty in solitude can secure deep inner rewards. Many of my pivotal memories involve solitary experiences with nature, so I understand the draw of the solitary encounter with the wild.    5) Being destitute and at the mercy of circumstances allows us to connect with exhilarating experience - this weird juxtaposition of self-reliance and dependence on the kindness of strangers. I've experienced this several times when our car broke down far from civilization and people \\"miraculously\\" came along to help us.    6) Some kids are just wired differently than \\"normal.\\" McCandless was strong-willed and refused to let anyone tell him what to do, especially his parents. He also thought he was smarter than others. Some people just make up their mind what they're going to do and nothing can deter them.    7) Some young people, for whatever reasons, reject societal values and mores.  History reveals examples of people who share this solitary inclination: highly intelligent, injured by others, idealistic, on a mission. Krakauer mentions medeival Irish monks as fitting this category.    8. It is a quality of youth to think nothing is impossible and to be willing to take risks. Later in life after some risks have caused painful damage, we become more cautious and self-protective.     9. People who are intelligent and capable often find that success comes easy. They get used to having confidence that they can overcome any obstacle. The harder the challenge, the more they relish the opportunity.    So, I think McCandless had a mix of these qualities and characteristics, some positive and some detrimental.  It's great to have confidence, so seek solitary connection with nature, to be willing to suffer pain and discomfort in the heroic journey. However, it is detrimental to be over-confident in refusing wise counsel.    Sometimes these qualities can become a dangerous mix - the ignorance of youth mixed with the over-confidence of youth often leads to trouble. It is the fortunate young man who makes it through to his 30's without suffering damage. But when the dangerous qualities are present in extremes, it is usually a prescription for disaster, as was the case for McCandless.    He was extreme in his cut-off from his family and from his past identity as an educated, comfortable, upper-middle-class person. He was extreme in his desire to do things the hard way, such as eating only rice for weeks at a time. He was extreme in refusing help or advice from people. His desire for solitary connection with the wild was extreme.     Apart from these extremes, he might have survived as a rugged outdoorsman like many rock climbers, skiers and mountaineers. However, his extremes led him to tackle an Alaska survival project that included no safety net. The resultwas almost predictable. Was McCandless' journey heroic or suicidal? I don't think it was intentionally suicidal, because I think he realized he was placing himself in a risky situation. He knew enough to know he could die if things went wrong.    He was smart enough to research hunting skills, but not smart enough or patient enough to gain actual hunting experience before placing his life at the mercy of his hunting abilities. He knew enough to take a gun, but not enough to know what kind of a gun was needed, much less how to be proficient in using a gun for survival.    I've seen profiles of survival fanatics in Alaska who actually do what McCandless attempted to do - they live alone by their wits in wild Alaska. But to succeed, these people first gain years of wide experience in all manner of survival skills. They learn what it takes to survive an Alaska winter before they launch out to attempt it. This preparation and survival seasoning us what McCandless lacked and thought he could do without. His hubris cost him his life.

B000BKVQTS|2.0|[[ASIN:B000BKVQTS The Brothers Grimm]]  as with some movies this one does not quite live up to what the studios presented it to be.  It is well done, but is more of a comedy then a great thriller.  The main characters are a bunch of con artist that have been forced to solve a real magical curse and a mystery.  They do however it showed great courage and the special effects were well done.  This one is worth the price and will most likely be watched more than once.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter the First Season is totally engrossing and addictive.  If time permitted I would have watched it in a marathon.  The writers, actors, directors etc of this series are certainly creative and clever!  The very graphic bloody scenes are shocking but necessary and therefore, the viewer is accepting and understanding.  Dexter is an unforgettable character and will live on in my memory forever. I impatiently await season 2 on DVD.  Buy this DVD set!

0060935464|4.0|Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is an accurate representation of the struggle for civil rights. One character, Calpurnia,  particularly caught our eye as she was a respected figure in the Finch household  even though she is an African American working for the family. Despite being a valued member of the family, and a mother figure to Scout and Jem, Calpurnia is looked down on by outsiders, the reserved citizens of Maycomb; for example, even Aunt Alexandra, sister to Atticus, is concerned about Calpurnia's place in the family, convinced that the household \\"[doesn't] need her now.\\" It is evident that Calpurnia's right to be respected is disregarded by others.          While most Southern whites of the 1960s were racist, Atticus Finch, a white man, agreed to legally defend an African American, Tom Robinson. By doing so, Atticus becomes an object of ridicule and prejudice. Being called derogatory names such as \\"nigger-lover\\" and \\"negro trash,\\" Atticus is threatened both verbally and physically. At one point in the novel, a mob arrives at the jail to attack him. He is saved only by his daughter, Scout, as she humanizes him. Atticus' loyalty and devotion to the civil rights cause is inspirational.           The average southern white is greatly contrasted by Lee's portrayal of Mr. Dolphs Raymond. He is a white man who feels more comfortable with blacks than with whites. This is a welcome juxtaposition as it creates a contrast between the average southern citizens and himself. Dolphus' character not only supports civil rights but opens readers to the possibility of peaceful integration. This book is recommended to readers interested in the 1960s civil rights movement.    Written By Nadia Kadry, Madeleine Varmer, Anna Rittman-Tune, and Caroline Kemper

I normally walk 3 miles/ 4 times a week but this video made me feel muscles I didn't know I had. The best part about the video is that the exercises are simple and even when I think I want to stop the video, I remember that it is almost over. The length of the video motivates me to do it. Everyone has 20 minutes for themselves especially when you are getting results.
B00005JOA0|1.0|I grew up in a valley with six large steel mills that worked 24/7 during WWII. The blast furnaces spewed ashes over the town several times a day, and we didn't know anything but smoky, smelly, overcast skies - except when it rained or snowed which cleaned the air for a while. But a few hours after the snow ended it became black from the ash. Not exactly the scene from a Christmas card.    There were four sets of railroad tracks between our house and the river, and the trains ran all the time carrying war materiels. There was a lot of drunkenness, gambling, fighting, wife beating, and other violence. This is probably the real reason that blackouts and a curfew were imposed - to try to keep people under control.     Georgie, my next door neighbor and best friend's mother was shot six times one summer evening by her drunken, enraged husband. Georgie and his two older sisters became wards of the state and I never saw them again.    I tell you this because I have not recalled these events for many, many years until watching 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'. Thank goodness my gun was in the safe, or I probably would have shot out the TV. It's really that awful.
B00000IQW3|4.0|if you like sci-fi, this is one to be in your collection.  It was well written and has characters you can believe in.

By this one new, you will want to watch it over and over again.

B0013J30XG|5.0|The first film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers since the crushingly disappointing Matrix Revolutions (V for Vendetta was only written and produced by them) is unlike almost anything I've seen in theatres, especially at this time of the year. And in a good way. Opening with a kaleidoscopic version of the traditional Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow logos, Speed Racer makes it clear as to what tone the movie will be. Colorful. And it is in more ways than one.    First and foremost, Speed Racer is quite simply one of the most unique looking movies you will see all year. From the colorful and incredibly creative design of the race tracks and cities, to the rocket powered cars, the Wachowski Brothers and their crew have forged a look to call their own in this movie. But aside from just the visual design, the Directors are also not content to just deliver the same old \\"Hollywood Blockbuster\\" formula and instead give us a movie full of interesting editing techniques and non-linear narratives, not just for show, but all of it helping achieve not only the look and feel of the movie but also supporting the story of the characters being told on screen by truly bringing to the forefront the characters emotions and motivations, making the films explosive finale feel that much more gratifying. The brothers have succeeded in making a Summer blockbuster that isn't one at all. The entire production is a bold move by the Directors.    The main attraction of the movie is of course the races. Races the likes of which you have never witnessed, thanks to some of the most impressive CG I've ever seen. The cars are rendered fantastically, blending in perfectly with the unique world. Natural effects are given cartoony effects (check out the trails of sand in the dunes! Amazing!) to bring out the source materials origin. The utterly indescribable amount of colors being twisted and woven into the scenerey is nothing short of astonishing and by a certain point, all of these elements come together to deliver a moment that is so fantastical, and so otherwordly, it becomes a moment that will have you either sitting in awe or profoundly applauding.    While many other CG heavy \\"blockbusters\\" have been claimed to be soulless and empty (Transformers anyone?), this is not the case with Speed Racer. The characters resonate, the family chemistry is convincing, and their bonds and love for each other is portrayed in such a sincere light, it is a breath of fresh air in this era of cynics (both in movies and real life). In fact, it is this combination of utter honesty in characterization and storytelling and outlandish visual design that truly make Speed Racer the first movie to deservedly earn the label of \\"live action anime.\\" It's not just the cartoony set up and villains, but the combination of the style of storytelling and visual creativity that make this movie appealing to both children and to the children inside those of us who are older, for me this has always been one of the defining features of some of the best anime, and this film has truly captured this spirit.    All in all, I heartily recommend Speed Racer. The inner child in you will be wowed and any regular kids will have an utter blast watching it. The Wachowski's usually accustomed to R rated fare prove that they can make a family oriented movie as well. And at the same time, they have delivered a summer blockbuster that is quite frankly unlike any other. After the disappointment of The Matrix Revolutions, I believe in the Brothers again, and I once again look forward to whatever they will bring us next.

0394818237|5.0|I got this one as a child, back in the sixties. My copy is in Dutch and although a little weathered it's not falling apart yet.  The copy I'm reviewing here is a reprint that misses several spreads, but  sad though it may be, if you don't know about it you won't miss it.   Richard Scarry shows different \\"people\\" (animals in clothes), all kinds of professions, how they interact and how one depends on the other. And in doing so he introduces a child to society where we all depend on one another.  More than anything else he was responsible that I grew up to be free minded and open spirited person. Whatever a human being does for a living, if he/she does it with love he will make your day.   A policeman, a baker, a newspaper man, a writer, photographer or singer, the postman, the bus driver. We all depend on one another. And as long as we try our best to understand that and accept and respect our fellow citizens we will be on the right path.  His drawings are world famous. They're sweet and funny without being too simplistic. No matter what family, the rabbits, the mice or the pigs, even the worm, they're all lovely characters with different personalities.    It has always been my first choice as a gift for kids.

B00005V9IJ|5.0|I can think of only a handful of movies that have their audiences cheering the indefatigable resiliency of the human spirit.  \\"Papillon\\" certainly comes to mind, as does \\"Bridge Over the River Kwai.\\"  CAST AWAY definitely can be added to such an elite list; director Robert Zemeckis and headliner Tom Hanks deliver an absorbing, intense story about one man's refusal to be involuntarily exiled for the remainder of his days.<br /><br />Oh, the things we take for granted.  Running water.  Hot food.  A roof over our heads.  Imagine your predicament should you suddenly find yourself with none of these things--imagine your predicament if you had virtually no survival skills.  Such is the fate of Tom Hanks' character (a retentive, nondescript FedEx midmanager); one minute he's on a flight over the Pacific; the next he's on a secluded beach.  And thus both the character and the audience embark on a journey of discovery, as neither the cast away nor those viewing this film know how the survivor will be able to. . .survive.<br /><br />Accordingly, the conflict of the plot stubbornly yields to a series of victories--the audience and the character are simultaneously elated:  elated when that first coconut is opened; when that first fire is started; when--after four long, solitary years--a durable raft is built that will transport its lone passenger beyond the unforgiving barrier reef.  And finally, following rescue, following the aftermath of a disheartening, yet poignant, reunion with a former lover (Helen Hunt makes the most out of this small, yet powerful, role), the audience celebrates when Hanks' character stands at the crossroads of a desolate Texas intersection--literally in the middle of nowhere.  For the viewers realize, as does the character, that following four years of rugged survival under harsh conditions, any subsequent obstacles or decisions are gravy.  Pure gravy.<br /><br />Tom Hanks singlehandedly and wonderfully carries this movie.  He's believable, compelling, empathetic--funny.  This is easily one of his signature roles; and CAST AWAY is a signature celebration of the indomitable human spirit.<br />--D.

B0013FDM7E|5.0|I bought this movie at the request of my son.  I watched it prior to him for appropriate content, etc.  It's a really good (interesting) movie.  I wouldn't tag it as a \\"family\\" movie, although it did spark discussion about  global viruses and what some folks might do to eradicate something like that.  The \\"cartoons\\" that are part of the special features are not for little kids eyes.  They are definitely intended for teen and up.  I had reservations about my 12 yo watching, and his comment was something along the lines of \\"those were weird and kind of gross.\\"  However, the movie is good.  Not a lot of yuck/blood.  That's left to your imagination.

He actually sounds just as good live as on his albums.  You won't be disappointed for buying this product.

The MHD channel features the same London concert on occasions, and the video quality is much better that the DVD version.  However, the DVD has more material from the concert and the close-up and personal information about Amy, althought trite, is interesting.  Video's of her performances in the documentaries are riveting. The other interesting factor is that Amy changes the concert everytime you view it.  IOW, you'll see and hear nuances with the music and her patter with the audience each time you view the concert.
B0013FBTHO|4.0|This review is for the HD DVD release [combo disc, cheaper than standalaone DVD release] Even without the HDDVD side this is a great deal for a pretty good movie.

0143038419|2.0|Gilbert writes well:  the prose keeps the reader moving along through her adventures in middle-aged angst, and she is entertaining.  But the book is supposed to take us through her personal growth and self-discovery, and I was left with the distinct impression that she finished her journeys every bit as self-involved and self-indulgent as she had started them.  The people she encounters are two dimensional, either foils or backdrops (or both), and if there is any depth of feeling she developed, it is lost in her witticisms.  A quick, light read, but disappointing.
B000YAA68C|1.0|This is a slow moving film.

B0014Z4ON4|1.0|One of my all-time favorite movies will always be RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  Great movie, great memories seeing it when it came out in the summer of 1981, still a good movie to watch.<br /><br />Then in 1984, the sequel was released: INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.  The thrill was gone.  All of the action scenes looked like models and bad special effects (where was the stunt work that made the first film so exciting?).<br /><br />I didn't like the heroine (although the director certainly did since he married her).  Someone actually counted the number of times she screamed to see if she set some kind of record (Kim Basinger beat her in 1989's BATMAN).<br /><br />I hated that little kid.  Even worse than I hated the little brat from the old Godzilla movies.  Just annoying.<br /><br />And the story was just gross and mean-spirited.  Bugs, monkey brains, human sacrifice and incineration.  Nice.<br /><br />A big, induglent, ugly sequel.  A few years ago, the defunct Premiere magazine did a retrospective of these films and nearly everyone interviewed made excuses for it.  \\"Well, George (Lucas) was going through a divorce at the time....\\"<br /><br />I wasn't a huge fan of THE LAST CRUSADE either but...at least it wasn't as bad as TEMPLE OF DOOM.<br /><br />RAIDERS still rules though.

B0000062Y2|5.0|As a young teenager I had this double album and had memorized all the songs.  I have not heard the music since the mid seventies and wanted to hear it all again.  While listening to it, I found new meaning in the lyrics that did not occur to me in the past.  I thought the music and lyrics to be refreshing, uplifting, and still good old rock 'n roll.
B0015XASFS|5.0|The last song on the DVD,Awake, is my favorite Josh song of all time, and it always makes me feel warm, cozy and a bit sad to think about the passage of time, and loved ones.  This DVD (and the concert tour) is Josh Groban at his best, with his concerns for children, especially African children, at the forefront, and his musicality (musical genius I would say) touching hearts everywhere.  Josh is the international artist, a voice for everyone.  If you don't know Josh Groban's music, you might want to sample a bit, because I think there is something for everyone, from almost operatic Italian pop to electronica to sweeping ballads.  My life changed the first time I heard Josh sing over five years ago and I will happily never be the same.
0060764899|5.0|Every child should read this book series, and especially \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\\"  Every adult with a child's heart will love it as well.  It is a great story and a meaningful Christian allegory.  Having said that, the non-religious will love this regardless of the allegory.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis was a genius and wrote many powerful, thoughtful books.  I am just thankful that he set out to try his hand at children's books, because in Narnia we have been left with something that is truly special.
B0013J30XG|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Loads of special effects.  Most of them are used to create vivid, cartoonish backgrounds or weird transition effects.  But the racing scenes are fun too.<br />*The cars and all their gadgets are pretty cool.  The race tracks are a series of wild, loopy circuits (which reminded me of certain computer games.  Could also be a bad thing, because it is so wild, but I found it imaginative and cool).<br />*There is a cool kung-fu fight towards the end.  Also a few nifty shootout scenes.<br />*Pretty good story.  Contains a good amount of action, drama, comedy, and romance.<br />*Good cast of characters.<br />*Great writing.<br />*Music is not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The film bombards you with transitions and weird effects, and although it can be seen as hypnotic and stylish, it is also goofy and kind of dizzying.  I think it also detracts a lot from the action scenes.<br />*Some of the antics are a little too goofy (although this can be a good thing, because it corresponds to the cartoonish style).<br />*The racing scenes themselves, although cool and fun, are also very fast, and it can be hard to see what's going on.  Whatever you do, don't blink!<br />*A few scenes contain flashbacks that are intercut together, and can be convoluted (although you might also say that this is unique and stylish).<br /><br />This movie has its share of coolness, with the fast and furious racing scenes, nifty background effects, and some awesome writing.  At the same time, there are a lot of cartoon effects, some of which are great (like the backgrounds and the wild racing), some of which are goofy or weird (like some of the time-lapse effects, or the goofy antics), and some of which are annoying (like all of the transitions where people's heads move across the screen...I got pretty sick of it).  Still, it's vivid and entertaining.  Older kids should have a blast with it.  Fans of the original cartoon may enjoy it.  If you like crazy action or lots of sillyness (movies like \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" come to mind), then perhaps you should rent it when it comes out.ps you should rent it when it comes out.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|My husband is a student of history.  He has a particular interest in the Knights Templar.  While we saw the original in the theatre, when this came out it was simply a must have.  The additional footage would have been such a benefit.  While not historically correct, it is wonderful entertainment.

B00154GEFU|1.0|Who are the folks that actually like this album?  Not to be unkind, but to be truthful, PHOENIX by ASIA, is just plain awful.  Let's be truthful ASIA fans, this album is not up to the standards of their premier outing, 25 years ago, or even ALPHA.  Is this the best the orignial members could come up with after a 25 year hiatus?  I saw ASIA 30 days ago, and waited this long to listen to the CD so I could be objective.  If you purchased ASIA's FANTASIA-LIVE IN TOKYO CD OR DVD and expected more of the same, you are going to be greatly dissapointed.  There is a lot of pretense in PHOENIX and not much substance.  Of course, you will love PHOENIX if you like a lot of personal introspection by way of John Wetton.  As great as these guys are, after 25 years, LIVE, this album was \\"phoned in\\" as they say.  There is not one tune on the whole CD that grabs the listener.  There are two OK tunes, Sleeping Giant/No Way Back/Reprise and Alibis, but that is it they are just OK.  And, as far as this album goes it certainly proves there is \\"No Way Back.\\"  OK John we know you have overcome alcoholism and a heart attack, but enough with the sleppy, syrupy lyrics, it just gets boring after awhile.  This album should have been called \\"I'm Happy To Be Alive\\" and instead of the ASIA name the band should have reformed as ICON III or some such name.  The musicianship is impeccable, but it borders on something you'd hear in a pop singers Vegas revival show.      As for the 5 star reviews here I would like each and everyone of you to look me in the eye and honestly tell me that PHOENIX is a better piece of work than say, SILENT NATION, ARENA or even AURA for that matter?  Quit acting like Ashlee Simpson fans or dejected rejects from the Disney Channel and get real.  Despite your love for the band, be honest.    As for all the detractors of ASIA during the John Payne era, PHOENIX is proof that original membership does not a good CD make.  I guess if you are a long time ASIA fan, like myself, at$7.99, which is the current AMAZON price, you should own PHOENIX for your collection, but I say your money would be better spent on Extended Versions [Live] by ASIA featuring John Payne.  It is cheaper and contains much better music.    My only hope is that Geoff Downes will lay away his nostalgia get back together with John Payne and make good music.  But, since \\"the original ASIA\\" is such a cash cow franchise I won't hold my breath.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I saw Cloverfield twice the first weekend it came out, I thought it was a really good story.  I still don't understand where the monster came from, was it a U.S.Government fabrication that got loose? Where did it come from?    For me, this was a love story.     There are elements of Sci Fi (the monster) and Action (everyone running around screaming and trying not to get eaten and just survive it all), but these elements had to be included to attract those of us interested in Sci Fi and Action.      The love or romance part has to do with the two people involved. They both fight at his going away party, and it's their tape of that one special day together that gets taped over while making this \\"movie\\".  Thats why you see bits and pieces of their special day at Coney Island every so often. It has to do with him being stripped to the core of his being after losing his brother and observing the chaos around him, and deciding that his love for her is real and he's not going let her go or lose her, especially after her phone call telling him she's in trouble.    The remainder of the cast chose to follow him around in his quest to find her and save her. They all had a good opportunity to leave the city. And I found him to be noble in choosing to go after her.     In the end, they died anyway, but they died together.     It would've been nice to find out where the monster came from and if it died too.
B00005JKBC|4.0|For all its posturing and its stops along the blots on America's post-war copybook, Spy Game's probably no more realistic than The Spy Who Loved Me, but it is considerably better than expected considering its pedigree. Despite a few moments where he got carried away with the stylistics (such as the unintentionally hysterically funny freeze frame captions repeating a deadline every time someone mentioned it to underline the drama) and a rather silly ending, the pros definitely outweighed the cons for once in Tony Scott's espionage saga. Harkening back to the cynicism of 70s conspiracy thrillers like Three Days of the Condor but ultimately lacking the guts to go all the way with its nihilism, it's a lot more engaging and entertaining than it has a right to be. But it is hard to believe that CIA execs would be so genuinely delighted at the prospect of their own agents being executed by foreign powers.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|This is an awesome CD. Serj has a great voice and does well on this solo album. He is very talented and the CD is highly recommended.
B000WZAE1I|3.0|*** 2007. Based on Neil Gaiman's [[ASIN:0380804557 Stardust]], this film was co-written and directed by the British director Matthew Vaughn. The thing is basically a fairy tale with witches, a mean prince, a falling star and a naive hero. Nice production design and an excellent choice for a rainy afternoon with your kids. As for the artistic value and the originality of STARDUST, just let me say that the film is an hybrid mix of Rob Reiner's [[ASIN:B000TJBNHG The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition)]] and Hayao Miyazaki's [[ASIN:B00005JKYG Castle in the Sky]]. Knowing this won't prevent you to buy or rent this film but, if you have an ounce of self-respect, you will certainly now haw before telling everybody that STARDUST is a new classic of the fantasy genre. Already forgotten.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|I am somewhat hesitant about writing a review for this cd, because to me, this is when U2 went BIG TIME, and they weren't the small Irish band anymore that people like me loved.  Their first 4 cd's all had that distinct sound and this started to vary away from that sound.    After buying this version, I was reminded of how great this album truly is.  I would put this up there with the top 100 albums of all time ( along with the first four ).  The sound is clearer and the video alone,  ( the real reason I bought this version ), are incredible.    Remasters are usually a marketing ploy as far as I am concerned, with people not hearing much if any differance.  The new Genesis remasters are  ASTOUNDING, and I put this with them.  A differance you can hear!!!!    I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of U2 and their early works.  check out the upcoming remasters of the first three U2 cd's and you will be pleasently surprised, as I am sure I will.

B000002AGM|5.0|Either as its own or as part of the elegant boxed set collecting all of the orchestral collaborations between Miles Davis and Gil Evans, \\"Miles Ahead\\" finds the ripe Davis crossing into previously unchartered lands for him - playing in front of a large-scale orchestra conducted by Gil Evans.  Unlike the other orchestral collaborations, \\"Miles Ahead\\" has no specific theme or flavor to it, but it was the first of such albums, and its music stood tall because of its newness and daring approach, hence its name.<br /><br /> In \\"Miles Ahead,\\" Evans' orchestra serves as a bed of gentle flowers for Davis to walk upon while playing his delicate and meaningful musical statements.  The orchestra includes five trumpets, three trombones (and a bass trombone), three French horn players, a tuba player, three doublers between flute and clarinet, a bass clarinetist, Lee Konitz on alto, and Paul Chambers and Art Taylor on bass and drums, respectively, but rather than crush the sensitive Miles under its size and power, it surrounds and supports him with a soundscape of astonishing beauty and prods him to produce morsel after morsel of song from his flugelhorn.<br /><br />  Not only were these some of the top improvisers in jazz (Konitz) and studio musicians (the ubiquitous Jimmy Cleveland), but Gil Evans could be possibly the fairest and most brilliant of orchestrators to ever enter the realm of jazz.  Amazing in 1956 and equally impressive over fifty years later, \\"Miles Ahead's\\" numbers are not head-solo-head treatments or even \\"orchestral introduction then trumpet glory\\" sequences, either; any possible combination of the above instruments you can imagine is used in the recording.  Miles glides over the brass and reeds during rubato passages of the title track, or slowly convinces the diatonic notes of his instrument to come forth with solely the bass clarinet supporting him.  The resulting music is swinging, or lilting, or extravagantly magnificent, or even plaintive, but always stunningly beautiful.  Gil Evans is among the select group of musicians and composers whose voicings were golden 100% of the time (Ravel, Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner, etc.).<br /><br /> The ten selections connect together in a ten-part suite, some of which was rehearsed without Miles (before he came to the studio and after he left).  Springsville opens the album in fervid fashion, Miles' flugelhorn romping through the uptempo piece as if announcing a new man in town.  The chords change so quickly that there seems to be no settling of a tonic, presenting no problem to the soloist.  \\"Maids of Cadiz\\" slows the boat down, perhaps stopping at a village of beauteous (but forbidden?) maidens.  The melody is lamented and unleashes percussive accents from the brass and silky chords of every type imaginable for Miles to gently state the melody over.  Dave Brubeck's \\"Duke\\" could have been the \\"hit\\" of Side A of the record, featuring a half-time, happy, swinging melody that Miles states over rhythmic tuba and bouncy bass and drums - the solo section starts out with only horn accompanied by bass and drums, with strictly diatonic movement by the soloist joined by occasional preaching from the horn section.  \\"My Ship,\\" possibly one of jazz's most beautiful melodies, finds Evans really digging into the heart of the song to milk it for every note in the four and a half minutes of his orchestral rendition - the major ninth chords (with French horns stating the top note) create an unbelievably calm effect, combining nicely with Davis' subtle vibrato (Davis respecting the melody, barely embellishing it).  Side A (I'd imagine, anyway) closes with the title tune, with Davis climbing down from his lookout tower and riding with the rest of the orchestra in a rhythmically unison statement.  Davis solos over the mirthful chords, again, with such a diatonic approach - no tensional notes, no harmonic edge - yet his scalar flights fit perfectly with the rest of the orchestral palette.<br /><br /> \\"Side B\\" (let's stick with the LP theme) revisits the depressing minor mode with \\"Blues for Pablo,\\" evoking the feeling that the boat has reached a city's commanding citadel fronted by a tough, demanding guard up front.  For a large portion of this one, Miles steps out of the way and lets the orchestra release crunchy, dissonant voicings, bluesy figures, and punchy trumpet bombs.  \\"New Rhumba\\" is definitely the \\"hit\\" of Side B, featuring an even more rhythmically appealing melody than \\"Duke.\\"  This masterpiece by Ahmad Jamal was the sole requested addition by Davis, and its sus4 chords and syncopated figures create a listening experience that is simply a testament to the orchestral wisdom of Evans.  \\"Meaning of the Blues\\" slows the tempo back to the mellow Saturday night vibe, as if Miles were enunciating a story, the meaning of the blues, to a handful of listeners fascinated in his musical lore.  The melody's chordal structure is similar to a combination between \\"Summertime\\" by Gershwin and \\"Wave\\" by Jobim - a mix of morose melodic statements and hopeful chords that look to the horizon.  J.J. Johnson's \\"Lament,\\" another candidate for jazz's most gorgeous melody, once again evokes the image of the orchestra surrounding Miles in a sizeable circular hedge (those who have seen any footage of this collaboration know that the orchestra did, indeed, form a circle, with Miles in the middle), and rather than his drowning, the result is his piercing tone stating the melody over the supporting horns.  \\"Lament's\\" beauty simply can't be overstated, with its sequence of minor ninth chords (which Evans was a master of) finally resolving to a beautiful major destination at the end.  The album closes with \\"I Don't Wanna Be Kissed,\\" which could be the most conventionally jazzy of the melodies, following a rhythm changes structure and giving Miles a bass-drums solo background.  The resulting music is so delicate and fine-spun - the orchestra ended its journey at the rose garden and along its tour doesn't hit a single thorn.<br /><br /> If you are listening to the version of Miles Ahead as part of the boxed set, you'll notice that every track has an alternate take.  Good Lord, talk about \\"double or nothing!\\"  So the listener can enjoy the album and listen through it once more, the second set different enough (in terms of melodic interpretation and improvisations) to keep things interesting.<br /><br /> Miles Ahead finds Miles and Gil Evans lamenting the world, celebrating its vastness, and creating an unspeakably variegated image of moods in the process.  \\"Recommended\\" doesn't work - in lieu, how about, \\"there should be no opinion allowed - this music is artistically (and arguably aesthetically pleasingly) groundbreaking?\\"<br /><br />kce B\\" (let's stick with the LP theme) revisits the depressing minor mode with \\"Blues for Pablo,\\" evoking the feeling that the boat has reached a city's commanding citadel fronted by a tough, demanding guard up front.

B0000A5A0T|5.0|Review of CD by John Coltrane - Blue Train<br />Kevin Celebi<br /><br />If there were a list of the ten jazz albums that non-jazz listeners own, \\"Blue Train\\" would be number three behind Kind of Blue and Time Out.  And there's a reason for that - catchy title tune, no if's or but's about it.  The opening melody is memorable, singable, and is the kind of song that never leaves your mind since you heard it at age four.  After the melody statement and Coltrane's torrid flights to the seventh circle of the universe, the rest, to non-jazz listeners, is the same, but to jazz aficionados, it leads us into the land of Gods.<br /><br />\\"Blue Train\\" is an album of four songs that become instant jazz standards along with a shockingly caressing treatment of a standard into a ballad, filled with great musical statements; it is such a pity that Alfred Lion and John Coltrane signed a deal for only one record, knowing how much quality and quantity Blue Note Records provoked from its artists.  The improvisations are remarkably fair and, yes, the sole criticism that you've heard is true:  Coltrane blows his bandmates away and deals no apologies for doing so.<br /><br />The Blue Train Sextet (did they tour as the BTS?) was equipped with powerful horn soloists and a rhythm section very well acquainted with the art of swing.  Lee Morgan, playing on his beloved bent-up Dizzy-style horn, played some of the most incredible solos, from the standpoint of virtuosity and musical taste, of his career (matched only by his brilliance on Moanin' and The Sidewinder).  Coltrane, playing like an unchained animal released from the haven of his drug recovery bedroom, simply doesn't play a note that isn't remarkably fair.  Curtis Fuller, the young upstart trombonist from Detroit, plays fair musical statements as well, pleasing with full vibrato and wise rhythmic decisions.  The lamentably underrated Kenny Drew, aside from generously volunteering to try to either keep up with Coltrane or hold the fort during his improvisations, also offers elegant solos characterized by a merry touch.  Don't ever forget Paul Chambers, probably jazz's best timekeeper.  Philly Joe Jones, the restless master of the drum kit, was still at the peak of his powers in Miles Davis' quintet and his playing on this record shows why.  The sextet is robust and relentless, and they could have remained in the studio and recorded fifty songs if they had wanted to, rather than just five.<br /><br />\\"Blue Train\\" opens the album in the \\"listen to me, I'm Blue Train\\" fashion, ominous diminished whole tone chords mysteriously opening the way, before the straight four groove of the classic blues serve as the launching pad for Trane's jump into the stratosphere.  Trane most likely filled his glass (and his horn?) with wine before the tune, because the brilliance of his solo could have only been provided by a drunken Trane (note that he didn't actually get drunk at this session - it's simply a suggestion for the reason of why he is able to play so well).  Nearly his entire solo is double-timed, with not a single note left out, such rhythmic perfection.  Harmonically speaking, he climbs all over the Eb dominant scale, but when the turnaround approaches, he gobbles the tri-tone substitution right up and climbs all over that, too (mainly, an A7 substitution leading to an Ab7).  I hate to say it, as the other sidemen have been criticized in \\"Blue Note Records: A Biography\\" for \\"simply, just playing the blues\\" on their solos, but that is essentially what they do.  But just to say that they only play the blues is not doing their work justice - Morgan explodes into a frenzy of a chorus of straight-up sixteenth notes, for instance, and Fuller milks the blues scale for all it has in the timbre of a trombone.  The entire song is a romp through the blues with harmonic edge and ensemble power.<br /><br />\\"Moment's Notice,\\" obviously, is emblematic of Trane's love for the alchemy of chord changes and looks forward tohis landmark Trane changes.  However, it is also rhythmically appealing and its pedal point builds up tension, joy, and, yet again, another base for Trane to explode to the rim for another shattering dunk (sorry, I'm running out of metaphors for his boiling solos).  In his improvisation, Trane both sounds youthful and young, plowing right through the changes with ferventness, and old, displaying such harmonic wizardry that he could be the man who devised jazz himself.  Fuller struggles through his solo (but, hey, at least his struggles gave the song its title), and Morgan does all he can with the song's ridiculously difficult structure with his Clifford Brown tricks.  Another added bonus is some arco work by Mr. PC.<br /><br />\\"Locomotion\\" is another foray into, how about this, the blues.  The twist is the chromatically descending bridge to make things interesting.  Trane must have been drunk again (or just possessed) for his solo on this one, as his technical fluency propels him right through his chord changes, and his combination of bebop lines and tri-tone substitutions with flights through the avant-garde gives the song its sheen - the best part is that every note that he hangs onto has a bit of vibrato for extra measure.  Lee Morgan's eight-bar break entrance to his solo was heralded by Mark Levine as \\"possibly the best break in jazz improvisation to be recorded.\\"  Like I said, the 19-year old Morgan brought his fiery young heart to the studio and left nothing behind, and he is recorded particularly well, with some of his higher notes being mixed with some reverb to add emphasis.<br /><br />\\"I'm Old Fashioned\\" isn't played as much as it should be, but on Blue Train, it's full of beautiful song.  Trane was very much \\"sober\\" for his rendition of the melody, embellishing it with beautiful grace notes and Kenny Drew's Bud Powell-like accompaniment filling the song's cup with honey.  This is Fuller's chance to shine, as the trombone sounds perfect in the intimate, slowed-down settings of the jazz ballad, and Fuller's full-bodied tone sounds wonderful and he even has some fun quoting \\"My Funny Valentine.\\"  However, the show is stolen by none other than Lee Morgan, who plays a solo that is so melodic that I thought it was perhaps another melody statement, or written down.  He plays the last eight bars of the melody with his sassy embellishments, and delicately ends the song on its major chord, joined by the entire ensemble (including more arco Paul Chambers).<br /><br />As if Lee Morgan was going to relinquish the spotlight that he just stole, he keeps it by stating the melody to \\"Lazy Bird\\" and then guns into the first solo.  \\"Lazy Bird\\" is a ii-V7-I based melody that is the closest to bebop you'll get in this album, and Morgan has fun blazing his bop lines all over its chordal structure.  As for Trane, he was drunk again, but this time drunk with golden wine, playing his best solo of the entire record.  Listen to his bop lines (sounding like Charlie Parker slowed down and an octave below), his intervallic leaps, his splashes into the high register, and his gorgeous vibrato.  If there was a way to end this album properly and on a relaxing (but not anticlimactic) plateau, Lazy Bird was the answer.<br /><br />Of course, we live in the 21st century, so the original album is never enough.  \\"The Ultimate Blue Train\\" (I thought it was ultimate enough already) provides alternate takes of the first and last tunes, as well as being loadable into computers for an interview with a rather golden-aged Fuller.  Since this is John Coltrane in question, and one that was arguably intoxicated in the studio, you'll want to hear these alternate takes for his improvisations.<br /><br />And where did he get his wine?  From the ancient casks of the previously mentioned Gods?  We'll never know, but we'll always be able to rise and drink the beauty of Blue Train ourselves.  Maybe the non-jazz listeners will enjoy it for its faring forth to their ears as an irresistible collection of melody and \\"cool music,\\" but to me as a jazz musician, I'll never forget its kindling of my love for chordal brilliance, its improvisations bringing rise to the magic sun.<br /><br />kclowed-down settings of the jazz ballad, and Fuller's full-bodied tone sounds wonderful and he even has some fun quoting \\"My Funny Valentine.\\"  However, the show is stolen by none other than Lee Morgan, who plays a solo that is so melodic that I thought it was perhaps another melody statement, or written down.

0316926345|4.0|If you've never read anything by Waugh before, this is a good place to start. It keeps enough of his humor to be read for enjoyment, but it certainly included other themes--religion, friendship, betrayal (classic soap-opera love stories).    But before you read it, you should be aware that Brideshead Revisited is really two books. The first half is about the narrator, Charles Ryder, and his relationship with Sebastian Flyte. After they meet in college (Sebastian gives Charles a hothouse full of flowers), they develop an extremely close, possibly homoerotic relationship. Sebastian introduces Charles to his family, and the whole thing begins to slowly fall apart in chapters that are painful to read.    The second half of the book is about Charles' relationship with Sebastian's sister, Julia. It could be said that this is more psychologically accurate than the first half of the book, as all of the characters' flaws are exposed in gory detail. However, it's simply less fun to read. One of the most important characters from the first half, who you will probably love as much as I did, simply disappears. The two halves of the book are very sloppily connected, as Waugh tries to change course too quickly.    With the movie coming out soon, it might be a good idea to read this book now. Unlike the TV series, the plot of the movie looks to be significantly changed. Despite it's serious flaws, Brideshead Revisited is worth reading and enjoying on its own merits.
B00008XESD|5.0|If there were a list of the ten jazz albums that non-jazz listeners own, \\"Blue Train\\" would be number three behind Kind of Blue and Time Out.  And there's a reason for that - catchy title tune, no if's or but's about it.  The opening melody is memorable, singable, and is the kind of song that never leaves your mind since you heard it at age four.  After the melody statement and Coltrane's torrid flights to the seventh circle of the universe, the rest, to non-jazz listeners, is the same, but to jazz aficionados, it leads us into the land of Gods.<br /><br />\\"Blue Train\\" is an album of four songs that become instant jazz standards along with a shockingly caressing treatment of a standard into a ballad, filled with great musical statements; it is such a pity that Alfred Lion and John Coltrane signed a deal for only one record, knowing how much quality and quantity Blue Note Records provoked from its artists.  The improvisations are remarkably fair and, yes, the sole criticism that you've heard is true:  Coltrane blows his bandmates away and deals no apologies for doing so.<br /><br />The Blue Train Sextet (did they tour as the BTS?) was equipped with powerful horn soloists and a rhythm section very well acquainted with the art of swing.  Lee Morgan, playing on his beloved bent-up Dizzy-style horn, played some of the most incredible solos, from the standpoint of virtuosity and musical taste, of his career (matched only by his brilliance on Moanin' and The Sidewinder).  Coltrane, playing like an unchained animal released from the haven of his drug recovery bedroom, simply doesn't play a note that isn't remarkably fair.  Curtis Fuller, the young upstart trombonist from Detroit, plays fair musical statements as well, pleasing with full vibrato and wise rhythmic decisions.  The lamentably underrated Kenny Drew, aside from generously volunteering to try to either keep up with Coltrane or hold the fort during his improvisations, also offers elegant solos characterized by a merry touch.  Don't ever forget Paul Chambers, probably jazz's best timekeeper.  Philly Joe Jones, the restless master of the drum kit, was still at the peak of his powers in Miles Davis' quintet and his playing on this record shows why.  The sextet is robust and relentless, and they could have remained in the studio and recorded fifty songs if they had wanted to, rather than just five.<br /><br />\\"Blue Train\\" opens the album in the \\"listen to me, I'm Blue Train\\" fashion, ominous diminished whole tone chords mysteriously opening the way, before the straight four groove of the classic blues serve as the launching pad for Trane's jump into the stratosphere.  Trane most likely filled his glass (and his horn?) with wine before the tune, because the brilliance of his solo could have only been provided by a drunken Trane (note that he didn't actually get drunk at this session - it's simply a suggestion for the reason of why he is able to play so well).  Nearly his entire solo is double-timed, with not a single note left out, such rhythmic perfection.  Harmonically speaking, he climbs all over the Eb dominant scale, but when the turnaround approaches, he gobbles the tri-tone substitution right up and climbs all over that, too (mainly, an A7 substitution leading to an Ab7).  I hate to say it, as the other sidemen have been criticized in \\"Blue Note Records: A Biography\\" for \\"simply, just playing the blues\\" on their solos, but that is essentially what they do.  But just to say that they only play the blues is not doing their work justice - Morgan explodes into a frenzy of a chorus of straight-up sixteenth notes, for instance, and Fuller milks the blues scale for all it has in the timbre of a trombone.  The entire song is a romp through the blues with harmonic edge and ensemble power.<br /><br />\\"Moment's Notice,\\" obviously, is emblematic of Trane's love for the alchemy of chord changes and looks forward to his landmark Trane changes.  However, it is also rhythmically appealingand its pedal point builds up tension, joy, and, yet again, another base for Trane to explode to the rim for another shattering dunk (sorry, I'm running out of metaphors for his boiling solos).  In his improvisation, Trane both sounds youthful and young, plowing right through the changes with ferventness, and old, displaying such harmonic wizardry that he could be the man who devised jazz himself.  Fuller struggles through his solo (but, hey, at least his struggles gave the song its title), and Morgan does all he can with the song's ridiculously difficult structure with his Clifford Brown tricks.  Another added bonus is some arco work by Mr. PC.<br /><br />\\"Locomotion\\" is another foray into, how about this, the blues.  The twist is the chromatically descending bridge to make things interesting.  Trane must have been drunk again (or just possessed) for his solo on this one, as his technical fluency propels him right through his chord changes, and his combination of bebop lines and tri-tone substitutions with flights through the avant-garde gives the song its sheen - the best part is that every note that he hangs onto has a bit of vibrato for extra measure.  Lee Morgan's eight-bar break entrance to his solo was heralded by Mark Levine as \\"possibly the best break in jazz improvisation to be recorded.\\"  Like I said, the 19-year old Morgan brought his fiery young heart to the studio and left nothing behind, and he is recorded particularly well, with some of his higher notes being mixed with some reverb to add emphasis.<br /><br />\\"I'm Old Fashioned\\" isn't played as much as it should be, but on Blue Train, it's full of beautiful song.  Trane was very much \\"sober\\" for his rendition of the melody, embellishing it with beautiful grace notes and Kenny Drew's Bud Powell-like accompaniment filling the song's cup with honey.  This is Fuller's chance to shine, as the trombone sounds perfect in the intimate, slowed-down settings of the jazz ballad, and Fuller's full-bodied tone sounds wonderful and he even has some fun quoting \\"My Funny Valentine.\\"  However, the show is stolen by none other than Lee Morgan, who plays a solo that is so melodic that I thought it was perhaps another melody statement, or written down.  He plays the last eight bars of the melody with his sassy embellishments, and delicately ends the song on its major chord, joined by the entire ensemble (including more arco Paul Chambers).<br /><br />As if Lee Morgan was going to relinquish the spotlight that he just stole, he keeps it by stating the melody to \\"Lazy Bird\\" and then guns into the first solo.  \\"Lazy Bird\\" is a ii-V7-I based melody that is the closest to bebop you'll get in this album, and Morgan has fun blazing his bop lines all over its chordal structure.  As for Trane, he was drunk again, but this time drunk with golden wine, playing his best solo of the entire record.  Listen to his bop lines (sounding like Charlie Parker slowed down and an octave below), his intervallic leaps, his splashes into the high register, and his gorgeous vibrato.  If there was a way to end this album properly and on a relaxing (but not anticlimactic) plateau, Lazy Bird was the answer.<br /><br />Of course, we live in the 21st century, so the original album is never enough.  \\"The Ultimate Blue Train\\" (I thought it was ultimate enough already) provides alternate takes of the first and last tunes, as well as being loadable into computers for an interview with a rather golden-aged Fuller.  Since this is John Coltrane in question, and one that was arguably intoxicated in the studio, you'll want to hear these alternate takes for his improvisations.<br /><br />And where did he get his wine?  From the ancient casks of the previously mentioned Gods?  We'll never know, but we'll always be able to rise and drink the beauty of Blue Train ourselves.  Maybe the non-jazz listeners will enjoy it for its faring forth to their ears as an irresistible collection of melody and \\"cool music,\\" but to me as ajazz musician, I'll never forget its kindling of my love for chordal brilliance, its improvisations bringing rise to the magic sun.<br /><br />kcunds wonderful and he even has some fun quoting \\"My Funny Valentine.\\"  However, the show is stolen by none other than Lee Morgan, who plays a solo that is so melodic that I thought it was perhaps another melody statement, or written down.

B000002ADT|5.0|CD Review with Miles Davis and John Coltrane - \\"Kind of Blue\\"<br />Kevin Celebi<br /><br /> By this point, it's not a matter of whether or not somebody has Kind of Blue, but at what age he or she got it.  \\"Did you get it for your birthday?\\"  \\"Did you buy it at the record store when you were six years old?\\"  There are millions of stories surrounding this record and each of its millions of purchases, and yes, that number is justified.  I got this album as a birthday present a whopping six times (it seems to make a good gift), but never actually understood it from a musical standpoint until recently.  Before that, however, I indeed was allured by its heavy swing and mellow atmosphere (when playing this at night, I never made it past \\"So What\\" before falling asleep).<br /><br /> The playing of \\"Kind of Blue\\" will evoke a glad clamor among whatever atmosphere it is lighting up because of the brilliance of its compositions, predominant musical ambiance, and the perfection of its musicians.  The perfect mix of the sound (a good amount of reverb and intimacy) evokes the feeling of the studio being a massive, grand hall with big oaken doors, the consummate swinging by Paul Chambers inviting visitors to stride right in.  The end of the hall is the hearth, the warmth of the lush voicings and elegant playing of Bill Evans, and the candles set in tall wooden sticks represent the light and flickering drumming by Jimmy Cobb.  The laughing and chattering of the hall's guests is the buoyant and brilliant playing of soul-jazz specialist Cannonball Adderley.  The throng of weary but profoundly strong soldiers triumphing into the hall after battle is the strength of John Coltrane, never ceasing his musical journey and not one note daunted by the modal challenges of Davis and Evans.  The short side-path that leads to the blues garden is the cameo by special guest blues specialist Wynton Kelly.  Finally, the entwining curtains hanging from the stained-glass windows are the meaningful, deep and intense musical weavings of Davis himself.  Come stay awhile and partake in the feast.<br /><br /> \\"So What,\\" kick-started ominously by Evans and Chambers, leads into probably jazz's most recognizable melody.  Aside from its obvious catchiness, So What shocked the jazz world into listening to a song with only two chords, both based on the Dorian mode.  Miles, thankfully, approaches the new landscape humbly, telling a story with his solo and reaching a chilling climax with his second chorus (how on earth did his statement of the ninth coincide perfectly with the matching accompaniment from Evans and Chambers on the same beat?).  Trane weaves some tapestries himself, being in full \\"sheets of sound\\" mode, and Adderley has a ball with the freedom, playing possibly jazz's best lick at 6:17.  There wasn't enough time to give Evans a full-blown solo, but he chords his way through a halfhearted solo with melody statements from the horns.  It's only the beginning.<br /><br /> The token \\"hit\\" of the record, if it's not So What, has to be \\"Freddie Freeloader\\".  It's an addictive melody coupled with a hard swing in four, and the guy it depicts must have been a relatively sneaky freeloader.  Wynton Kelly wasn't very happy to see the pianist he replaced (Evans) at the studio, but perhaps this goaded him into his smoking, incendiary solo over the blues, perfect with blue notes, grace notes, Lydian dominant accents, and his impeccable use of block chords to milk the song for all the grease it has.  Miles keeps up the bluesy mood with his smears and perfect swing, Trane breaks the bluesy mood completely with his lighting of a wildfire in the studio (mind you, it still sounds amazing), and Adderley shines light through the door with his incredibly bright tone and use of the Lydian dominant mode.  It's a blues, but it feels like so much more than that - can the blues be groundbreaking?  In the hands of these musicians, it apparently was.<br /><br /> Blue in Green (like most ofthe album's music), was by Evans and stolen by Miles.  Adderley lays out for this one and Davis pops in his beloved vehicle, the shimmering harmon mute.  The melody's structure is built upon minor chords and ii-V7-I's, almost akin to what Charlie Parker would have done if his music was slowed down by about four times.  This is Evans' turn to shine, as he pours a red glow into the pot and starts a warm, kindling fire - he really makes it obvious that he wrote the composition with his ease of navigating its changes.  Trane, as much as he was revered for being the explosive, freakish master of the tenor saxophone's quirks, had the most beautiful tone to grace the instrument, and he adds to Evans' fire with some musical tales of his own.<br /><br /> \\"All Blues\\" was Davis' attempt to capture African dancers' use of finger drums:  the tremolo effect used by Evans was the closest they could get to it.  It's a 6/8 rendition of the blues, and as Miles sometimes said, it was \\"Milestones slowed down.\\"  Not sure what he meant by that remark since Milestones is as far as you can get from the blues - but \\"All Blues\\" is indelibly \\"cool\\" - especially at the turnaround with the diminished whole tone chord.  The melody is stated with a harmon, but Miles pops it out for his solo, in which he refuses to blaze any fires, but merely delicately traces along the framework with a bunch of tonics.  Next is Adderley, who digs some logs out from the hall's storage:  he would need them for the fire that he would indeed light in the middle of the room.  He especially has fun with the aforementioned \\"cool\\" turnaround.  Trane takes the logs of Adderley's fiery solo and stomps them out with his sheets of sound, in the process burning his own solo and daring the next soloist, Evans, to extinguish it.  Evans indeed does extinguish it with his delicacy, for his improvisational fire was a magic fire, and its charms (especially the right hand harmony) were sources of unspeakable power.  It's no \\"Freddie Freeloader,\\" but it doesn't need to be - it's a different kind of blues.  Kind of Blues?  I think I'm getting to the record's title, finally.<br /><br /> Last but not least is another stretch of music that Miles ripped off from Evans, who uses his famous \\"Peace Piece\\" vamp to lead into \\"Flamenco Sketches.\\"  They decided, instead of remaining with the gorgeous C major mode, that they'd also add a few other modes in there as well, namely, Ab Sus4, Bb Maj7, D Phrygian, and G Dorian.  The cycle makes absolutely no sense, but they greatly aid the sextet in what they were doing (without trying) - revolutionizing music with respect for diatonic beauty.  Miles uses harmon to great effect, telling his tale carefully and fully - and for once, Coltrane doesn't use his sheets of sound approach, instead playing a solo that, until this point, was better than anything he had ever played, each note carefully chosen and the vibrato emphasizing its meaning.  Adderley takes the torch and is almost laughing at his newfound freedom - it has been said before that he sounds like he is struggling, trying to play bop lines in the modal territory - but to me it sounds like he is giddy without the confines of chordal resolution, and he embraces the flatted ninths of the flamenco chord.  Finally, it should only be fitting that the last solo of the album goes to the mastermind behind all of its compositions, as Evans brings back his red glow from \\"Blue in Green\\" and wows the rest of the musicians with his fleet, gliding approach, everyone basking in the warmth of his fire.  Such a magisterial album could only be closed by the crystalline flights of notes trickling from Evans' fingertips.<br /><br />In terms of alternate takes, there is one of Flamenco Sketches; but to this listener, Kind of Blue is an untouchable suite that needs no alternate takes nor should ever be adorned with any.  The sequencing of its original music is perfect and stands tall on its own; however, the silver lining is that this alternate take is only a mirror of the album's closer, so it could be considered an extension of the finale.  The album can be purchased as its own (it's so owned that it could be bought for probably three cents these days) but, for lovers of the genius of John Coltrane (and who isn't in that crowd?) the music is better when included in the boxed set of Miles Davis and John Coltrane on Columbia, which also includes a live gig by this very sextet at the Plaza.<br /><br />A very fair hall that this sextet built, one with fire-flickers dancing upon the ceiling and walls and the occasional deep shadows looming in the corner.  Kind of Blue deserves every single purchase and every single (sometimes disgustingly slavish) word of praise, it is the Michael Jordan, the Shakespeare, the Pablo Picasso of jazz.  The great hearth will warm the ears of all listeners and they'll never want to leave the ambiance of such a great entrance room.Freeloader,\\" but it doesn't need to be - it's a different kind of blues.

B0012E6R3W|4.0|Yes, all metal folks know the story now:  Testament have returned nine years later with 95% of the original band and have put together an album leaning more towards their classic thrash sound.  Sounds wonderful, eh?  How could it not?  Practically all online reviews of this album have been positive, and I do have to say I agree.  While it may not kick you in the teeth the way The New Order did when you heard it so many years ago, it's refreshing and feels like a visit from old friends.  This is a good thing coz this new album and reformation could have gone horribly wrong.<br />Yes, Testament have dug back into their classic thrash days for this album's sound(they even use the old band logo again).  However it's not simply a halfassed retread of their glory days, but rather some good new songs in the old style that actually work.  They didn't abandon what they did on The Gathering, there are still touches of that sprinkled all throughout the album too.  Formation of Damnation is a bit more of a midpaced album with only a few speedy tunes.  Usually this kind of thing worries me, but I found that I enjoyed pretty much all of it(I think there's only one song I don't care all that much for).  I only have one small complaint about this album, and it's certainly not something to dissuade someone from getting it.  That would be that most of the songs deal with the Bush Administration or war in the Middle East.  These kinds of lyrics do absolutely nothing for me.  I have seen and heard enough about the war and I have my own opinions about it, and I tend to listen to music to escape from things I read in the paper and see on CNN all the time.  So, I really couldn't care less about the lyrics here.  But hey, it's their songs and their album, so I figure they could write about damn near anything they want to, right?<br />All in all, I've been enjoying this cd quite a bit.  It's a wonderful example of how a band like Testament simply doesn't peter out of existence because it's not the 80s thrash heyday anymore.  If anything, their age and experience show that they are masters of their craft and they love what they do.  You know time has gone by when you notice in the band's \\"Thank Yous\\" that most of them thank their wives and children.  Personally I think that's a great thing being a family man myself now.  Just goes to show that you're never too old to rock and roll.  Formation of Damnation is definitely worth a listen, especially to the younger bands who should get a taste of how the big boys play.80s thrash heyday anymore.

B0012BMMZ2|5.0|Either as its own or as part of the elegant boxed set collecting all of the orchestral collaborations between Miles Davis and Gil Evans, \\"Miles Ahead\\" finds the ripe Davis crossing into previously unchartered lands for him - playing in front of a large-scale orchestra conducted by Gil Evans.  Unlike the other orchestral collaborations, \\"Miles Ahead\\" has no specific theme or flavor to it, but it was the first of such albums, and its music stood tall because of its newness and daring approach, hence its name.<br /><br /> In \\"Miles Ahead,\\" Evans' orchestra serves as a bed of gentle flowers for Davis to walk upon while playing his delicate and meaningful musical statements.  The orchestra includes five trumpets, three trombones (and a bass trombone), three French horn players, a tuba player, three doublers between flute and clarinet, a bass clarinetist, Lee Konitz on alto, and Paul Chambers and Art Taylor on bass and drums, respectively, but rather than crush the sensitive Miles under its size and power, it surrounds and supports him with a soundscape of astonishing beauty and prods him to produce morsel after morsel of song from his flugelhorn.<br /><br />  Not only were these some of the top improvisers in jazz (Konitz) and studio musicians (the ubiquitous Jimmy Cleveland), but Gil Evans could be possibly the fairest and most brilliant of orchestrators to ever enter the realm of jazz.  Amazing in 1956 and equally impressive over fifty years later, \\"Miles Ahead's\\" numbers are not head-solo-head treatments or even \\"orchestral introduction then trumpet glory\\" sequences, either; any possible combination of the above instruments you can imagine is used in the recording.  Miles glides over the brass and reeds during rubato passages of the title track, or slowly convinces the diatonic notes of his instrument to come forth with solely the bass clarinet supporting him.  The resulting music is swinging, or lilting, or extravagantly magnificent, or even plaintive, but always stunningly beautiful.  Gil Evans is among the select group of musicians and composers whose voicings were golden 100% of the time (Ravel, Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner, etc.).<br /><br /> The ten selections connect together in a ten-part suite, some of which was rehearsed without Miles (before he came to the studio and after he left).  Springsville opens the album in fervid fashion, Miles' flugelhorn romping through the uptempo piece as if announcing a new man in town.  The chords change so quickly that there seems to be no settling of a tonic, presenting no problem to the soloist.  \\"Maids of Cadiz\\" slows the boat down, perhaps stopping at a village of beauteous (but forbidden?) maidens.  The melody is lamented and unleashes percussive accents from the brass and silky chords of every type imaginable for Miles to gently state the melody over.  Dave Brubeck's \\"Duke\\" could have been the \\"hit\\" of Side A of the record, featuring a half-time, happy, swinging melody that Miles states over rhythmic tuba and bouncy bass and drums - the solo section starts out with only horn accompanied by bass and drums, with strictly diatonic movement by the soloist joined by occasional preaching from the horn section.  \\"My Ship,\\" possibly one of jazz's most beautiful melodies, finds Evans really digging into the heart of the song to milk it for every note in the four and a half minutes of his orchestral rendition - the major ninth chords (with French horns stating the top note) create an unbelievably calm effect, combining nicely with Davis' subtle vibrato (Davis respecting the melody, barely embellishing it).  Side A (I'd imagine, anyway) closes with the title tune, with Davis climbing down from his lookout tower and riding with the rest of the orchestra in a rhythmically unison statement.  Davis solos over the mirthful chords, again, with such a diatonic approach - no tensional notes, no harmonic edge - yet his scalar flights fit perfectly with the rest of the orchestral palette.<br /><br /> \\"Side B\\" (let's stick with the LP theme) revisits the depressing minor mode with \\"Blues for Pablo,\\" evoking the feeling that the boat has reached a city's commanding citadel fronted by a tough, demanding guard up front.  For a large portion of this one, Miles steps out of the way and lets the orchestra release crunchy, dissonant voicings, bluesy figures, and punchy trumpet bombs.  \\"New Rhumba\\" is definitely the \\"hit\\" of Side B, featuring an even more rhythmically appealing melody than \\"Duke.\\"  This masterpiece by Ahmad Jamal was the sole requested addition by Davis, and its sus4 chords and syncopated figures create a listening experience that is simply a testament to the orchestral wisdom of Evans.  \\"Meaning of the Blues\\" slows the tempo back to the mellow Saturday night vibe, as if Miles were enunciating a story, the meaning of the blues, to a handful of listeners fascinated in his musical lore.  The melody's chordal structure is similar to a combination between \\"Summertime\\" by Gershwin and \\"Wave\\" by Jobim - a mix of morose melodic statements and hopeful chords that look to the horizon.  J.J. Johnson's \\"Lament,\\" another candidate for jazz's most gorgeous melody, once again evokes the image of the orchestra surrounding Miles in a sizeable circular hedge (those who have seen any footage of this collaboration know that the orchestra did, indeed, form a circle, with Miles in the middle), and rather than his drowning, the result is his piercing tone stating the melody over the supporting horns.  \\"Lament's\\" beauty simply can't be overstated, with its sequence of minor ninth chords (which Evans was a master of) finally resolving to a beautiful major destination at the end.  The album closes with \\"I Don't Wanna Be Kissed,\\" which could be the most conventionally jazzy of the melodies, following a rhythm changes structure and giving Miles a bass-drums solo background.

B00007GZQZ|3.0|The Money Pit starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long was a childhood favorite of mine, I used to watch this film all the time but watching it now, it is dated and not that funny. Tom Hanks can make any horrible film moderately good, his comic timing is impeccable, he is a genius. There are some funny moments but mostly this box office bomb is pretty lame now, just watch it if you are a die-hard Hanks fan.
B00005GA1R|5.0|Either as its own or as part of the elegant boxed set collecting all of the orchestral collaborations between Miles Davis and Gil Evans, \\"Miles Ahead\\" finds the ripe Davis crossing into previously unchartered lands for him - playing in front of a large-scale orchestra conducted by Gil Evans.  Unlike the other orchestral collaborations, \\"Miles Ahead\\" has no specific theme or flavor to it, but it was the first of such albums, and its music stood tall because of its newness and daring approach, hence its name.<br /><br /> In \\"Miles Ahead,\\" Evans' orchestra serves as a bed of gentle flowers for Davis to walk upon while playing his delicate and meaningful musical statements.  The orchestra includes five trumpets, three trombones (and a bass trombone), three French horn players, a tuba player, three doublers between flute and clarinet, a bass clarinetist, Lee Konitz on alto, and Paul Chambers and Art Taylor on bass and drums, respectively, but rather than crush the sensitive Miles under its size and power, it surrounds and supports him with a soundscape of astonishing beauty and prods him to produce morsel after morsel of song from his flugelhorn.<br /><br />  Not only were these some of the top improvisers in jazz (Konitz) and studio musicians (the ubiquitous Jimmy Cleveland), but Gil Evans could be possibly the fairest and most brilliant of orchestrators to ever enter the realm of jazz.  Amazing in 1956 and equally impressive over fifty years later, \\"Miles Ahead's\\" numbers are not head-solo-head treatments or even \\"orchestral introduction then trumpet glory\\" sequences, either; any possible combination of the above instruments you can imagine is used in the recording.  Miles glides over the brass and reeds during rubato passages of the title track, or slowly convinces the diatonic notes of his instrument to come forth with solely the bass clarinet supporting him.  The resulting music is swinging, or lilting, or extravagantly magnificent, or even plaintive, but always stunningly beautiful.  Gil Evans is among the select group of musicians and composers whose voicings were golden 100% of the time (Ravel, Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner, etc.).<br /><br /> The ten selections connect together in a ten-part suite, some of which was rehearsed without Miles (before he came to the studio and after he left).  Springsville opens the album in fervid fashion, Miles' flugelhorn romping through the uptempo piece as if announcing a new man in town.  The chords change so quickly that there seems to be no settling of a tonic, presenting no problem to the soloist.  \\"Maids of Cadiz\\" slows the boat down, perhaps stopping at a village of beauteous (but forbidden?) maidens.  The melody is lamented and unleashes percussive accents from the brass and silky chords of every type imaginable for Miles to gently state the melody over.  Dave Brubeck's \\"Duke\\" could have been the \\"hit\\" of Side A of the record, featuring a half-time, happy, swinging melody that Miles states over rhythmic tuba and bouncy bass and drums - the solo section starts out with only horn accompanied by bass and drums, with strictly diatonic movement by the soloist joined by occasional preaching from the horn section.  \\"My Ship,\\" possibly one of jazz's most beautiful melodies, finds Evans really digging into the heart of the song to milk it for every note in the four and a half minutes of his orchestral rendition - the major ninth chords (with French horns stating the top note) create an unbelievably calm effect, combining nicely with Davis' subtle vibrato (Davis respecting the melody, barely embellishing it).  Side A (I'd imagine, anyway) closes with the title tune, with Davis climbing down from his lookout tower and riding with the rest of the orchestra in a rhythmically unison statement.  Davis solos over the mirthful chords, again, with such a diatonic approach - no tensional notes, no harmonic edge - yet his scalar flights fit perfectly with the rest of the orchestral palette.<br /><br /> \\"Side B\\" (let's stick with the LP theme) revisits the depressing minor mode with \\"Blues for Pablo,\\" evoking the feeling that the boat has reached a city's commanding citadel fronted by a tough, demanding guard up front.  For a large portion of this one, Miles steps out of the way and lets the orchestra release crunchy, dissonant voicings, bluesy figures, and punchy trumpet bombs.  \\"New Rhumba\\" is definitely the \\"hit\\" of Side B, featuring an even more rhythmically appealing melody than \\"Duke.\\"  This masterpiece by Ahmad Jamal was the sole requested addition by Davis, and its sus4 chords and syncopated figures create a listening experience that is simply a testament to the orchestral wisdom of Evans.  \\"Meaning of the Blues\\" slows the tempo back to the mellow Saturday night vibe, as if Miles were enunciating a story, the meaning of the blues, to a handful of listeners fascinated in his musical lore.

B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I personally think there were a lot of problems with this one.  The person holding the camera for most of the movie was insanely annoying.  Even during the disaster, he was making jokes and saying things like \\"ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB,\\" and \\"You guys see that?\\" The monster was continuously being attacked by machine guns, missles, and bombs and it never got a scratch.  Throughout the movie, wherever the main characters were, so was the monster.  How could the monster \\"know\\" where they were all the time?  During the rescue attempt, the chopper flies close above the monster; how dumb can you be?  Since you only see what the video camera sees, a lot of the story is left out and you only know what the person holding the camera knows; therefore, nothing is explained at all.  The amazing thing about the movie was the computer graphics, which simulated new york city very well.
B000005H7D|5.0|If there were a list of the ten jazz albums that non-jazz listeners own, \\"Blue Train\\" would be number three behind Kind of Blue and Time Out.  And there's a reason for that - catchy title tune, no if's or but's about it.  The opening melody is memorable, singable, and is the kind of song that never leaves your mind since you heard it at age four.  After the melody statement and Coltrane's torrid flights to the seventh circle of the universe, the rest, to non-jazz listeners, is the same, but to jazz aficionados, it leads us into the land of Gods.<br /><br />\\"Blue Train\\" is an album of four songs that become instant jazz standards along with a shockingly caressing treatment of a standard into a ballad, filled with great musical statements; it is such a pity that Alfred Lion and John Coltrane signed a deal for only one record, knowing how much quality and quantity Blue Note Records provoked from its artists.  The improvisations are remarkably fair and, yes, the sole criticism that you've heard is true:  Coltrane blows his bandmates away and deals no apologies for doing so.<br /><br />The Blue Train Sextet (did they tour as the BTS?) was equipped with powerful horn soloists and a rhythm section very well acquainted with the art of swing.  Lee Morgan, playing on his beloved bent-up Dizzy-style horn, played some of the most incredible solos, from the standpoint of virtuosity and musical taste, of his career (matched only by his brilliance on Moanin' and The Sidewinder).  Coltrane, playing like an unchained animal released from the haven of his drug recovery bedroom, simply doesn't play a note that isn't remarkably fair.  Curtis Fuller, the young upstart trombonist from Detroit, plays fair musical statements as well, pleasing with full vibrato and wise rhythmic decisions.  The lamentably underrated Kenny Drew, aside from generously volunteering to try to either keep up with Coltrane or hold the fort during his improvisations, also offers elegant solos characterized by a merry touch.  Don't ever forget Paul Chambers, probably jazz's best timekeeper.  Philly Joe Jones, the restless master of the drum kit, was still at the peak of his powers in Miles Davis' quintet and his playing on this record shows why.  The sextet is robust and relentless, and they could have remained in the studio and recorded fifty songs if they had wanted to, rather than just five.<br /><br />\\"Blue Train\\" opens the album in the \\"listen to me, I'm Blue Train\\" fashion, ominous diminished whole tone chords mysteriously opening the way, before the straight four groove of the classic blues serve as the launching pad for Trane's jump into the stratosphere.  Trane most likely filled his glass (and his horn?) with wine before the tune, because the brilliance of his solo could have only been provided by a drunken Trane (note that he didn't actually get drunk at this session - it's simply a suggestion for the reason of why he is able to play so well).  Nearly his entire solo is double-timed, with not a single note left out, such rhythmic perfection.  Harmonically speaking, he climbs all over the Eb dominant scale, but when the turnaround approaches, he gobbles the tri-tone substitution right up and climbs all over that, too (mainly, an A7 substitution leading to an Ab7).  I hate to say it, as the other sidemen have been criticized in \\"Blue Note Records: A Biography\\" for \\"simply, just playing the blues\\" on their solos, but that is essentially what they do.  But just to say that they only play the blues is not doing their work justice - Morgan explodes into a frenzy of a chorus of straight-up sixteenth notes, for instance, and Fuller milks the blues scale for all it has in the timbre of a trombone.  The entire song is a romp through the blues with harmonic edge and ensemble power.<br /><br />\\"Moment's Notice,\\" obviously, is emblematic of Trane's love for the alchemy of chord changes and looks forward to his landmark Trane changes.  However, it is also rhythmically appealingand its pedal point builds up tension, joy, and, yet again, another base for Trane to explode to the rim for another shattering dunk (sorry, I'm running out of metaphors for his boiling solos).  In his improvisation, Trane both sounds youthful and young, plowing right through the changes with ferventness, and old, displaying such harmonic wizardry that he could be the man who devised jazz himself.  Fuller struggles through his solo (but, hey, at least his struggles gave the song its title), and Morgan does all he can with the song's ridiculously difficult structure with his Clifford Brown tricks.  Another added bonus is some arco work by Mr. PC.<br /><br />\\"Locomotion\\" is another foray into, how about this, the blues.  The twist is the chromatically descending bridge to make things interesting.  Trane must have been drunk again (or just possessed) for his solo on this one, as his technical fluency propels him right through his chord changes, and his combination of bebop lines and tri-tone substitutions with flights through the avant-garde gives the song its sheen - the best part is that every note that he hangs onto has a bit of vibrato for extra measure.  Lee Morgan's eight-bar break entrance to his solo was heralded by Mark Levine as \\"possibly the best break in jazz improvisation to be recorded.\\"  Like I said, the 19-year old Morgan brought his fiery young heart to the studio and left nothing behind, and he is recorded particularly well, with some of his higher notes being mixed with some reverb to add emphasis.<br /><br />\\"I'm Old Fashioned\\" isn't played as much as it should be, but on Blue Train, it's full of beautiful song.  Trane was very much \\"sober\\" for his rendition of the melody, embellishing it with beautiful grace notes and Kenny Drew's Bud Powell-like accompaniment filling the song's cup with honey.  This is Fuller's chance to shine, as the trombone sounds perfect in the intimate, slowed-down settings of the jazz ballad, and Fuller's full-bodied tone sounds wonderful and he even has some fun quoting \\"My Funny Valentine.\\"  However, the show is stolen by none other than Lee Morgan, who plays a solo that is so melodic that I thought it was perhaps another melody statement, or written down.  He plays the last eight bars of the melody with his sassy embellishments, and delicately ends the song on its major chord, joined by the entire ensemble (including more arco Paul Chambers).<br /><br />As if Lee Morgan was going to relinquish the spotlight that he just stole, he keeps it by stating the melody to \\"Lazy Bird\\" and then guns into the first solo.  \\"Lazy Bird\\" is a ii-V7-I based melody that is the closest to bebop you'll get in this album, and Morgan has fun blazing his bop lines all over its chordal structure.  As for Trane, he was drunk again, but this time drunk with golden wine, playing his best solo of the entire record.  Listen to his bop lines (sounding like Charlie Parker slowed down and an octave below), his intervallic leaps, his splashes into the high register, and his gorgeous vibrato.  If there was a way to end this album properly and on a relaxing (but not anticlimactic) plateau, Lazy Bird was the answer.<br /><br />Of course, we live in the 21st century, so the original album is never enough.  \\"The Ultimate Blue Train\\" (I thought it was ultimate enough already) provides alternate takes of the first and last tunes, as well as being loadable into computers for an interview with a rather golden-aged Fuller.  Since this is John Coltrane in question, and one that was arguably intoxicated in the studio, you'll want to hear these alternate takes for his improvisations.<br /><br />And where did he get his wine?  From the ancient casks of the previously mentioned Gods?  We'll never know, but we'll always be able to rise and drink the beauty of Blue Train ourselves.  Maybe the non-jazz listeners will enjoy it for its faring forth to their ears as an irresistible collection of melody and \\"cool music,\\" but to me as ajazz musician, I'll never forget its kindling of my love for chordal brilliance, its improvisations bringing rise to the magic sun.<br /><br />kcunds wonderful and he even has some fun quoting \\"My Funny Valentine.\\"  However, the show is stolen by none other than Lee Morgan, who plays a solo that is so melodic that I thought it was perhaps another melody statement, or written down.

0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird exemplifies the feminist views of its time.  The book tells the story of Scout, a young girl living in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama, and her adventures with her older brother Jem and their summertime friend Dill.  The trio's escapades are set against the background of a black man in their community, Tom Robinson, being tried for raping a white woman.  Scout's father Atticus acts as a lawyer for the trial, bringing Scout and Jem ridicule from their peers.  Throughout the novel, Lee conveys a feminist message.    Scout, the protagonist, is a rambunctious, tomboy who defies the expectations of women in the 1930s Southern Alabama society; for example, on page 22, Scout beats up Walter Cunningham, which is uncharacteristic of a \\"proper\\" lady.  Scout spends her days \\"usually mud-splashed or covered with sand\\" instead of drinking tea with the ladies (Lee 131).  Furthermore, Scout gets a gun for Christmas, thus engaging in a normally male-dominated activity.  Scout is boyish, unruly, and adventurous; yet, she is perceived positively, as a protagonist of the novel.  Lee shows that women can be self-sufficient and intelligent without being \\"girly.\\"     On the other hand, the characters that conform to society by adhering to standards for women are often perceived as mean or shallow; for example, Mrs. Dubose is Scout's \\"gender appropriate\\" neighbor.  Mrs. Dubose criticizes Scout for wearing overalls.  \\"'You should be in a dress and camisole, young lady!'\\" Mrs. Dubose yells from her porch (Lee 101).  Despite being feminine, a trait favored by society, Mrs. Dubose is also mean, sharp-tongued, and selfish.  Scout's Aunt Alexandra is also a feminine character who is overly critical of Scout's wanton ways.  According to Aunt Alexandra, Scout should fill her time \\"playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave [Scout] when [she] was born\\" (Lee 81).  Aunt Alexandra further tells Scout that she shouldn't \\"bedoing things that require pants,\\" meaning Scout should act like a young lady, not a man (Lee 81).  Aunt Alexandra's antagonistic nature shows that feminine qualities are not necessary to be moral.     Lee has written a spellbinding story that tackles the feminine stereotypes of the time.  It parallels the heavy issues of women's rights with the tale of a young girl coming of age.

1400079179|3.0|Perhaps because I was already well acquainted with the scandalous issues raised in this book due to its wide publicity, I did not find it in the least as breathtaking as I had anticipated. It does raise some controversial topics and elaborates on others that have already been voiced, and is, of course, a very welcome breakthrough for all conspiracy lovers out there. Whether it is mere fiction or a legitimate alternative view on the issue of the Holy Grail, I don't really care. An enjoyable read for me, but that's about it. The action could not grab or fascinate me, the characters were a bit shallow and predictable, and all in all, the book was a little too superficial to my taste. It does have some intriguing descriptions, links and associations, and one can easily see that Brown has done his research well, which made me feel like a complete profane on the topic. The biggest merit of the book is that it makes you reassess critically most preconceptions that are taken for granted in today's society. History, after all, has always been a matter of view point. In terms of literary merit, I must say I enjoyed \\"Angels and Demons\\" a lot more. I give this one three stars for the interesting plot, but other than that, it was a little of a disappointment for me.

Does Fox think the general public will just buy it because it is on Blu-Ray?  Shame on you Fox!    Save your money, but if you like the movie as much as I did, buy the Widescreen Collector's Edition.

I can't believe she can kill you like that in 20 min's.  The first work out I thought I was going to throw up, but the 2nd was better and by the 6th was doing pretty good.  I tried Level 2 and thought I was going to die so it takes some building up but she is effective. You can feel yourself getting stronger.  This is a great work out video.  Only thing I'm having problems with is my knees.  After day 7 I had to take a day off.  It says 30 days shred so I figured it was daily with no breaks.  You may want to consider a day of rest and also wear tennis shoes, use a mat, and try to work out on a surface that is not too hard.  It is very high impact.  My knees are swollen and I've had to ice them...I'm in my mid-30's so my knees are not as young as they used to be :)  Good luck ladies!!! or even Gents!!!
B0013FXWU6|3.0|The many ways that greed manifests are countless in this film.  Virtually no character goes without claim on some level of selfishness when oil is discovered on otherwise useless California properties.  The lives of the inhabitants of a small farm community are turned upside down when the reality of what wealth can be gained dawns on them, as well as when they realize the price they will pay to have it.  The story is a believable exploitation of the land and lives of those striking out on the American frontier. Central to its conflict are Daniel Plainview, a slick oil prospector with the sincerity of a snake oil salesman, and Eli Sunday, the ambitious young pastor of a struggling country church.<br /><br />Day-Lewis Truly deserved all the accolades he won for his performance of Daniel Plainview in this film.  The range of his skills was wholly evident in this film, from the overall reserved and refined mannerisms of Plainview, to his later explosive and subtly vitriolic snide treatment of others.  In truth, every performance in this film was flawless.  In particular Paul Dano, Sunday, should have gotten more attention for his supporting role.  His passionate sermons were frightening and moving in his ability to swing from demure to suddenly thundering.  The physicality he brought to the character was entrancing as much as creepy.  I'm excited to think of what work he will do from this point forward.<br /><br />Overall the direction of the film seemed to be spot-on in delivery.  Most impressive to me were the great gaps in dialogue.  I'm always impressed when a scene is forced to move forward without speech.  That said, I'm not quite sure to what the poor pacing and seeming gaps in sequencing should be attributed.  In some places the film moved quite slowly, while sudden artless segu&eacute;s seemed to leave out huge chunks of time and plot development.  I also found the score to be extremely distracting throughout most of the film.  Indeed it was innovative and not what one would expect in a western...  Still, the musical arrangements were not only ill-suited for a lot of the film, but they were flat out too loud in much of it.<br /><br />All-in-all, the film is well done.

The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very tastefully done as well.<br /><br />The CD starts with Diana doing a sublime job on \\"It Could Happen To You;\\" she aces this easily and she never skips a beat! Her voice is in excellent form and she is able to successfully pull in her listeners with the heartfelt feeling she puts into this ballad. \\"Isn't This A Lovely Day\\" features Diana squarely front and center--right where she belongs! Diana's voice is clearly able to infuse this tune with great emotion and that impresses me greatly. The piano arrangement is also very elegant. I really like \\"Isn't This Is A Lovely Day.\\"<br /><br />\\"How Insensitive\\" is a tender love ballad about a love that goes wrong when there are too many honest misunderstandings; Diana was born to sing these ballads and again she delves right into this tune to make it her own with a few tempo and key changes. Great! I predict that you'll like \\"How Insensitive\\" if you haven't already heard it. In addition, Diana also makes good on \\"Exactly Like You;\\" this upbeat number about a love and its joys really shines brighter than silver and gold combined when Diana Krall sings it. Diana performs this to perfection and the music never drowns her out--it all THAT good.<br /><br />\\"From This Moment On\\" from Kiss Me Kate proves that Diana can really belt out a tune and this melody gets strength from a faster than normal tempo. Diana Krall never sings a superfluous note and I'm sure you'll love every minute of this classic ballad. \\"Little Girl Blue\\" has a great treatment by the oboe (I think); and when Diana comes in this number takes flight even if it's not the most optimistic you'll ever hear.<br /><br />\\"Day In Day Out\\" is a classic pop vocal tune that gets the royal treatment from Diana Krall and she sings and swings brightly to make this number shine! The jazzy arrangement works very well for this tune and it's easily another major highlight of this CD. I love it! \\"Willow Weep For Me\\" has another elegant piano arrangement that enhances the natural beauty of this number; and when Diana comes in the number glows even brighter--she truly makes \\"Willow Weep For Me\\" her masterpiece with her uncanny sense of timing.<br /><br />The CD also ends well with Diana Krall performing a medley of \\"It Was A Beautiful Day In August\\" and \\"You Can Depend On Me.\\" What a strong ending for Diana's album!<br /><br />Diana Krall fans will want this for their collections. I notice that some reviewers didn't like it but I still think the majority of Diana Krall fans will go for this CD. This is also a fine CD for people who like classic pop vocals.e and it's easily another major highlight of this CD.

0670018651|1.0|I hoped for so much more from this!    As a guide, it's a mess.  There's a crying lack of indices and solid information about the perfumes reviewed.  Classic scents are overlooked as the authors review endless number of flankers and \\"here today, gone tomorrow\\" scents.    Much has been made of the tone of the reviews and I agree.  This is not a seamless collaboration.  Where LT has the heft of years of experience and an academic background, TS's reviews sound like the forum opiner she was until all too recently.  She tries to emulate LT's tone, but without his knowledge, it's too meta, too pointless, and too snarky for its own sake.    A shorter book of reviews by Mr. Turin alone, concentrating on scents that have or will stand the test time to the extent of at least more than 6 months of faddishness would have been so much better.  In fact...  why not just publish a translation of his \\"Parfums: Le Guide\\"?  It would be much more informative and enjoyable than this hodgepodge.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is amazing! I've been working out regularly for about a year, lost 24 lbs, and this workout kicked my butt!!  This is a great at home workout.  Jillian definitly knows her stuff.  The only bad thing (like any home workout video) is that it begins to get monotonous.  Also, there is a HUGE differece from workout one to workout two.  Two is much more difficult than one, really no transition between the two.  Would definitely recommend this video!
0756404746|3.0|If you are an avid fantasy reader, this is a book you have probably read before.  Whether it is Trudy Canavan's Magician's Guild (about equal in quality) or Robin Hobb's The Assasin's apprentice (much better).  If the only fantasy you have ever read is Harry Potter, then this book will be a treat. Rothfuss hits all the fantasy genre cliche's, yet handles them deftly--orphan boy with incredible intelligence/magical skill, boy gets trained in magic, some professors love him and some hate him, crush on mysterious girl, bully/antagonist, and much larger world events he get's caught up in.  While extremely derivitive, he does add some freshness to the genre.  For example, his magic system is very creative, logical, and interesting.  Rothfuss is also a fairly skilled writer and keeps the plot moving at a good pace until one episode owth a pseudo dragon at the end which seems to go on forever.    The main character is a bit too superhuman, but he does have some personality flaws which at least make him somewhat believeable.  It's a pretty good start to a series, but hopefully Rothfuss will move away from the cookie cutter plot as our hero becomes an adult.    If you liked this book, I recommend Robin Hobb's Assasin's Apprentice series.  She writes some of the most complex character's I have ever read, eventhough the first book was also a bit derivitive.  Hopefully Rothfuss can live up to her standard in his upcomming books.
B00139W3NE|5.0|Not knowing anything about `The Golden Compass' nor the book `Northern Lights' by Philip Pullman upon which this film is based, I must say I was not only pleasantly surprised, but amazed by what I saw and heard on my initial viewing. The visuals are astounding and the storyline is original, highly controversial (at least in the mind of some religious groups) and abnormally complex.<br /><br />Maybe even more amazing to me than how good this film is, was the high volume of criticism and low ratings it has compiled from Amazon reviewers. I can discern only three possible reasons for this unlikely occurrence;<br /><br />1- It's to be expected if the film diverges from the book, something purist cannot tolerant. (Again, not having read the book in question I cannot comment on its faithfulness to the source material).<br /><br />2- It might be a case of not appreciating the complexity of the story. You can't just jump into this film and immediately know what's going on. You have to exert a little effort and brain power to work your way into this alternate universe before settling down for the ride.<br /><br />3- However I'm certain that the biggest body of complaints come from Christian factions that don't like their belief system challenged in any form. The portrayal of an evil ruling body known as the Magisterium may hit a little too close to home for some Catholics and those within the Protestant camp will most certainly be bothered by seeing every human accompanied by what appears to be an animal familiar referred to as a daemon* (no it's not a demon, think of the Hellenistic concept of the daemonic).<br /><br />*These animals are part of the individual. In this imaginary world the soul is separated from the body and exists as a companion creature that accompanies the individual throughout life.<br /><br />If that wasn't enough to cause some of the faithful to begin beating their war drums and rattling their sabres it doesn't help to see a heroine who's furry companion is named Pan (short for Pantalaimon), an alluring Queen of the Witches with the angelic sounding name Serafina (i.e.: Seraphim) who fights with the \\"good guys\\", and the heroine's courageous Uncle, Lord Asriel who's name is all too similar to that of the fallen angel Azriel, long  associated with the Devil.<br /><br />These religious/mythological cross-references don't stop here. I noticed a couple borrowed from Norse mythology as well. There's Lorek Byrnison ( possibly referring to Loki, the trickster God) and the immense warrior, polar bear Ragnar Sturlusson could be a subtle reference to Ragnarok, the Nordic version of the Apocalypse.<br /><br />Of course there's always the possibility that someone simply doesn't like the film for reasons I've yet to comprehend, but I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy such an imaginative, allegorical, fantasy adventure. In case you haven't figured it out by now, I loved it!ring Queen of the Witches with the angelic sounding name Serafina (i.e.: Seraphim) who fights with the \\"good guys\\", and the heroine's courageous Uncle, Lord Asriel who's name is all too similar to that of the fallen angel Azriel, long  associated with the Devil.

0891419195|5.0|In his telling of his experience in some of the most intense battles of WWII in the Pacific, Eugene Sledge takes you into the foxhole for an incredible journey through two battles fought by US Marines.  Between the equatorial heat, cement hard coral landscape, intense relentless enemy fire, dead and rotting enemy bodies baking in the sun, bad K rations for food that is made worse by the smell of gunpowder, sweat, human waste and rotting bodies, and the 75% chance you will either be killed or wounded, you somehow can't leave his side as the reader or it would somehow be dishonorable.  Through Sledge's storytelling you grasp a real sense of what \\"team\\", \\"core\\" and \\"band of brothers\\" mean to a Marine.  It is the absolute best recount of war that I have ever read.  We as the next generation of \\"free\\" Americans owe it to the men and women who fought for our freedom to read this book.
B00000F214|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made.  The cast is perfect, the story holds your attention throughout.    In blu-Ray the picture and sound is perfect.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|After reading the one to two star reviews on \\"Hard Candy\\", I found a common thread to all of them: The entire CD is bland and generic and overproduced, lacking in hooks and melodies. I seriously question whether these people actually did listen to the CD because they do not give specific examples to back their opinion and their review can basically apply to any other CD out there....just replace the name of the artist and the album.    That said, this is my personal opinion of Hard Candy. Granted, when I heard that she is going to have Hip Hop influences in this work I was not thrilled and I do not expect to like this album. A demo of the song \\"the Beat Goes On\\" which leaked on the net did not raised my expectations and the tawdry crotch shot of the album cover didn't helped either.    I am a HUGE Madonna fan but I am also one that do not like everything she put out. I found American Life downright boring and Confessions of the Dancefloor was not what it was supposed to be (although it does have a killer song which I listen to practically everday: Get Together).    So I dive into \\"Hard Candy\\" with low expectations and I have to admit that it won me over; it is her best album in years. It is pure dance and fun, nothing about the Kabbala, nothing about her mother, nothing about the angst of being rich and famous.    The very first track, \\"Candy Shop\\" while not radio friendly, is a funny and ironic song that equates candy and sexual attraction. The second song, 4 Minutes, is a loud mishmash which turn out to be one of the weaker tracks of the CD (and I suspect the one and two star reviewers only heard this song and not the others).    Ultimately the rest of the songs falls into three categories: sweet confections (\\"Give It 2Me\\", \\"The Beats Goes On\\", \\"Hearbeat\\"), funny novelties (\\"Spanish Lessons\\", \\"She's Not Me\\", \\"Candy Shop\\") or bland suckers (\\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\")....and this album has plenty of sweets and a minimum amount of suckers. Even then, the suckersdo have their own unique flavor.    \\"Give It 2 Me\\" is pure slice of Madonna dance heaven, followed by the thumping \\"Heartbeat\\". \\"Miles Away\\" is a bittersweet semi-ballad. \\"She's Not me\\" is another funny song which could have done without the last two minutes, which added nothing to the song except to draw it out with endless repeats. \\"Incredible\\" , like \\"4 Minutes\\", I consider one of the lesser tracks but it does have an infectious beat and an interesting looping chorus. The \\"Beat Goes On\\" as presented here is a vast improvement over the demo...a totally different song, the only thing it retained was the chorus. \\"Dance 2Night\\" for me is a throwaway which I didn't find very interesting. \\"Spanish Lessons\\" is like \\"La Isla Bonita\\" meets \\"I am Going Bananas\\". The album closes with \\"Voices\\", another catchy sweet confection accompanied by a seductive beat.    \\"Hard Candy\\" is the one Madonna album since \\"True Blue\\" that I can suck on...I mean listen to in its entirety from beginng to end repeatedly.
B000OONQBM|5.0|...and probably more so than when it was first released in theaters.  In this version, they made some minor adjustments when transitioning to a few scenes to where they give it a brief comic book look.  When I fist saw it I was a little upset (I guess I'm sort of a purist when it comes to movies, minus visual clarity improvements), but after understanding the origin of the movie and seeing the effect a few times, I kind of liked it.  The bonus features are good, especially for fans of the movie.  Get it while you can.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Yes, the photography is spectacular at times , and yes, you can only get this resolution on HD with a Blu-Ray  disc. All chapters of Planet Earth may however, not be as captivating as say a Discovery Science episode. It is a story of nature and its creatures told plain and simple, as it is.

0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird is set in a rural Southern town during the Dpression of the 1930s. The story is told from the perspective pf Scout Finch, a school-age Caucasian girl from a struggling middle class family. She has many encounters with conflicting social pressures. Many are quick to point out the civil rights aspect of the novel; however, even deeper into is, the subject of feminism is also addressed. From a feminist view, this novel excellently portrays social struggles of women during the era of the Depression.     Throughout the novel Scout is faced with an interesting dilemma concerning her gender and feminism. She is continuously faced with conflicting messages coming from Jem and Dill and from the likes of Aunt Alexandra or Mrs. Dubose. Jem and Dill are constantly encouraging Scout to act less like a traditional girl, and to spend more time in overalls than in dresses; for example, Jem tells Scout, \\"I declare to the Lord you're getting' more like a girl every day\\" after Scout declines to accompany Jem and Dill to the Radley House.     On the other hand Scout faces intense pressure to act like a convention girly-girl from the likes of her Aunt Alexandra and Mrs. Dubose; for example, Scout says, \\"Aunt Alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. I could not possibly hope to be a lady if I wore breeches; when I said I could do nothing in a dress, she said I wasn't supposed to be doing things that required pants. Aunt Alexandra's vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave me when I was born.\\"    In addition, Scout feels that she is isolated from other children by Aunt Alexandra as a result of her gender. She desires to \\"graduate to the big table\\" with the others, but she is not allowed to. Scout expresses that Aunt Alexandra \\"didn't understand girls much.\\"    Overall, the book fully addresses the expectations felt by both children and women and offers apowerful commentary on feminism in the depression era of the South. It explains how the feminist influences affected growing up during this time period. This formula makes for a classic novel.  [...]
0595440096|5.0|Still Alice is the type of story that rivets the reader right in place. Immediately, from the first paragraph, nothing else seems important until you turn the last page. And even then, as this review suggests, the story infiltrates its way into your heart and head and you want to share Alice's story.  At not quite fifty, the brilliant, athletic, university professor, Alice, begins to have odd moments of forgetfulness and disorientation that she chalks up to normal possibilities like menopause or a lack of sleep. Alice reluctantly consults a neurologist who diagnoses early onset Alzheimer's Disease. As Alice and her family begin to struggle and cope with her illness, she questions who she is and who she will become.   Two very remarkable aspects of this story stand out. The first is Genova's extensive and current social and medical research that informs and drives this story. The second most wonderful thing is Genova's ability to etch a tragic family story with just the right touch of light and hope.    The story demonstrates the dignity and eloquence of the human spirit even as it is altered and twisted by the dark and ugly beast of dementia.
B00000K3D4|5.0|A really good children's tale all be it, as most of the best ones are,quite dark. But then, the original Grimm's fairy tales were very dark ( hence, the apellation of \\"grim\\" as used today). Recommended for kids and adults alike.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|I had started with their latest album first but then immediately turned to the first one - both are excellent, while I like the Riot! a bit more.    For me - it has energy more than Pink, Avril Lavigne and Gwen altogether.  I am only concerned with a future of this band - hope it won't die in a mess of contemporary music.
1577314808|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone.  The Power of Now is a fascinating textbook for becoming a happy human being.  It is direct and easy to understand.  You see yourself on every page.  And, of course, it is even easier to see everyone else you know on these same pages!  Listen, learn and try it - you'll be glad you did.
0399243631|1.0|If you liked \\"where's spot\\" you're going to be disappointed by this book.   Other than the fact that it features Spot and has flaps.    It is very similar to \\"spot goes to the farm.\\"  Unlike the original \\"Spot\\" the plot line is less clear, the answers are less repetitive, and the answers behind the flaps are less concise.    We were so disappointed we returned it.
0452289963|5.0|This book is a mind blowing read!  In these pages you can find the real you.  And you will like yourself a whole lot - maybe even for the first time.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|This is an optimal way of showcasing a grand opera in a traditional production. Musically immensely satisfying, I think it beats the Salzburg Karajan version. My older friends who have seen Siepi perform this role live still rave about it, and rightfully so. Also absolutely stellar is Dermota's conception of Ottavio, voice and acting. There is no flaw in the cast. It is a \\"show\\" that once you turn on the set you want see as much of it as you can, maybe do it in one sitting.
B000002IWH|5.0|One of the best Soundtracks in history. A perfect match for a perfect film !
0894803123|5.0|Great little book. It was fun reading about the history of Ben and Jerry's. The writing style was easy and homey. We have made several batches of ice cream from the book and they were great. The recepies were easy and the explanations were great. We found we could save money by making our own ice cream and what we made was better than anything we would buy. Again, great little book.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Cloverfield is one of those movies that everyone seems split about. Half the people who watch it hate, the other half love it. And I suppose there a little percentage in the middle who are neutral.  I, personally, thought it was genius. It's been a very long time since I saw a monster movie that not only kept me interested, but made me research it when I got home from the theatre.  If you're interested, the sheer amount of supplimental content on the internet is astounding. Numerous blogs created by characters, websites from evil corporations, and the group trying to take them down.  Featureswise, this DVD isn't anything amazing. It has a few hidden easter eggs, but not much to really clear up any mystery. If anything, it made me question a little bit more.  This film is not, in any way, for people who get motion sickness. It's done in a handheld, 'shakycam' style, making it seem more real.  If you can handle all the movement and whatnot, and like a good monster movie, I highly recommend this to you.
B00000J7SS|5.0|I will start by saying that I don't know much about jazz--it's theory, styles, history, etc. I always liked older jazz/blues and discovered Miles Davis from Kind of Blue, which I first heard as background music at a party that drew my attention away from my friends and toward the music.    A friend suggested this disc as another classic Miles Davis CD so I bought it without ever having heard a track. I hated it. Then, one day, I was riding the subway home and Pharoah's Dance came up randomly on my ipod and it was as if a light had gone off and everything in the music and in the city made perfect sense (it's hard to describe).     I went on to explore the other tracks and have really grown to love and appreciate this album. It is very gritty and urban and, like a group of graffiti-covered tenement buildings, is so \\"ugly\\" that it's beautiful. If that makes any sense to you, then you will come to love this album, but expect to hate it at first.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|THE SOUND OF THIS EDITION IS GORGEOUS.  AN EXCELENT CONCERT IN FRANCE (1987) AND AN EXCELENT B-SIDES.  THE BEST OF THE BEST
0679777377|5.0|Few books are felt as much as read, but \\"The English Patient\\" falls into this category. Like the film, it is hauntingly beautiful, but for different reasons. The story of people haunted by love and war, their damaged souls converging at a villa in Italy, remains, but the focus and method in which the story is told on paper is spellbinding and stunning.<br /><br />The passages are like water moving to and fro over rocks, shifting back and forth in time so that the beauty beneath can still be seen, but as a shimmering mirage in the desert. It is a strange instance where it is almost recommended that you see the film first in order to see more clearly in your mind the characters as their stories unfold.<br /><br />Whereas the film focused more on the burned Almasy and his memories of the unending African desert, where he would meet the enigmatic and beautiful Katherine Clifton, sealing the fate which would leave him a charred and hollow shell of his former self, Hanah is the centerpoint of Ondaatje's lovely poetic prose in the novel. You can almost feel the ghosts hovering over each character as Ondaatje paints a masterpiece with words.<br /><br />Deeply romantic and lyrical, it is the same story, but a more impressionistic and less linear portrait of love and loss. The book is like a delicate flower just beneath the waters, its beauty evident but achingly kept just out of reach. The film brought the flower into the sun so we could enjoy its texture and fragrance in a more real fashion. Both are magnificent, just a different picture of the same flower.<br /><br />If you love the film, you must read the book. It is a hauntingly beautiful novel different from anything else you'll ever read. A masterwork of rich and evocative prose that will touch the heart, an organ of fire.

0767830555|5.0|I can definetely see why this movie is considered a classic. It is both powerful and disturbing. And completely memorable.   I havent made up my mind whether the ending is fantasy or reality and I do see a strong case for both, however I am leaning towards reality because I feel they wouldnt have panned the wall of his still oh-so-cheap apartment with the newspaper clippings and the letter. It would have been more dream-like. But who knows, lol. Perhaps it was left a bit ambiguous to produce discussion.     If someone did this in real-life the ending would be an institution for the criminally insane (probably for life), although many would regard the person as a hero IF the actual story came out accurately (thats a big if). And who says insane people dont ever become heroes :)     Im glad I watched it although I found it to be very hard to watch as I feel it was almost too real. With the meth and crack plague in America the portrayal of the young girl was a bit too close to home for me. Which is why this movie doesnt even feel as though it has aged a bit. In fact I am guessing it will remain relevant for many, many generations. It really is a classic.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|I am so glad I didn't waste my money on this worthless \\"film\\".<br />Being a Beatles fan, I was absolutely offended by this. The Beatles would be offended by this. John Lennon is rolling over in his grave right now.<br />I went into this movie wanting so badly to enjoy it, but I left wanting that hour and half of my life back. Yes, that is correct, I couldn't even finish it. I got to the Eddie Izzard \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" scene where he is the leader of a carnival, and I had to turn it off because I couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard.<br />The overall only enjoyment I got out of this movie was a bellyache from laughing so hard at this ongoing joke of a \\"film\\".<br />Don't waste your money on this movie. If you still want to see it, borrow it from a friend, but save your money for a movie that is really worth buying.<br />End note: If I had a time machine, I would go back into time and stop myself from wasting any time on this horrid movie.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Just tell the truth!!! Mr. Gore's talking points are exaggerations. He has misquoted scientists. Especially the melt down of Greenland theory.  Read the author you misquoted. He said IF the ice ever melted, the Ocean would rise a few inches not feet.      ABC news has exposed more of Mr. Gore's lies. He refused to answer ABC News of lying to the world. They found Mr. Gore's real-time film of the melting of the Ice shelf a BOLD face theft from a scene from a recent Sci-Fi movie. He and his movie production refused to talk to ABC News about the theft and re-doctoring of a computer made - special effects scene. Folks what you saw was not real.

From the ultimate strums of Flamenco Guitar on Alone Again Or to Sitting on a hillside watching all the people die on The Red Telephone and to facing each day with a smile on You Set The Scene, the listener is hypnotically bombarded with the most fascinating lyrics that seem to forever change with each listen, amazing orchestration, and barrages of electric guitar that influenced oh so many from Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, The Move, and The Doors to The Ramones, Pink Floyd, Alice Cooper, Robyn Hitchcock, Television, Lenny Kravitz, and Urge Overkill. This album, this band, and Arthur Lee, its leader, deserves to be in the Rock Hall of Fame, and they will be when we stop teething.<br /><br />Buy this version just to hear it in more ways.

B00005JPS7|5.0|Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) is a playboy genius whose passion is making things that go boom, day or night<br />2. Behind the successful billionaire is a pretty woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) showing off her organizational skills<br />3. During a product demonstration in Afghanistan, Stark is kidnapped by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings, sustaining serious injuries<br />4. Ten Rings wants to rule them all, and they want Stark to forge them the one weapon that can do it*<br />5. Working in the darkness where the shadows lie* Stark and Dr. Yinsen (a fellow prisoner who patched him up) pull a switcheroo and build a full metal power suit with a flame thrower and missile launcher.<br />6. The Ten Rings are left to pick up the pieces<br />7. Stark has a new corporate vision which gets a stormy reception from his partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the Board of Directors.<br />8. He fashions himself a new and improved armored suit, with all the trimmings, bells and whistles, plus the obligatory arc reactor which is the heart of the design<br />9. With help from Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and Lt. Col. Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark suits up to battle the bad guys<br />10. Two sequels are planned<br /><br />The movie takes a while to get to the really cool stuff, and while I enjoyed the whole thing, my son didn't get into it until \\"suit time.\\"  There's no denying that the finished suit is the coolest superhero costume ever, and I'm buying this on DVD just to watch the cybernetic Mark III suit morph, flex and create havoc and mass destruction<br /><br />Downey proves himself to be an excellent choice for the lead role, and although they are unable to steal his thunder, Bridges and Paltrow are pretty darned good themselves.  Howard doesn't have that much screen time, but maybe he'll get his moment in the sequels<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 11, 2008<br /><br />* One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br />One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br />In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br />(Tolkien)em  In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

B000058983|5.0|It has been called quintessential, a masterpiece, the great lost gem. Never has an album so encapsuled the tumultuos times we are living than Love's Forever Changes. From the ultimate strums of Flamenco Guitar on Alone Again Or to Sitting on a hillside watching all the people die on The Red Telephone and to facing each day with a smile on You Set The Scene, the listener is hypnotically bombarded with the most fascinating lyrics that seem to forever change with each listen, amazing orchestration, and barrages of electric guitar that influenced oh so many from Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, The Move, and The Doors to The Ramones, Pink Floyd, Alice Cooper, Robyn Hitchcock, Television, Lenny Kravitz, and Urge Overkill. This album, this band, and Arthur Lee, its leader, deserves to be in the Rock Hall of Fame, and they will be when we stop teething.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|I first learned of MGMT when they appeared on the David Letterman show, and I was intrigued by their grungy/campy look and the tonal pull of \\"Time to Pretend.\\"  (This song also was part of the soundtrack for the film \\"21.\\")  The version of the song on this CD is much more highly produced, with liberal synthesizing to enhance this retro-psychedelic ode to drugs and to living fast and hard.  The Brooklyn duo of Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser write their own music and lyrics, perhaps explaining why the songs so perfectly match their plaintive vocals.<br /><br />The tracks are an eclectic mix.  The previously mentioned \\"Time to Pretend\\" is made-to-order for pop stations.  The pseudo-disco \\"Electric Feel\\" seems composed for the dance floor, although the lyrics seem at once mindless and sexually sly.  \\"Weekend Wars\\" has a much more indie feel -- probably what Mick Jagger would sound like if he came of age a few years ago.  The desolation of the haunting \\"Pieces of What\\" hints at a maturity that many other tracks don't, suggesting that these two musicians might be on the verge of something more powerful.<br /><br />I generally approach electro/techno with apprehension since so much of it strikes me as pretentious.  However, MGMT has the right mix of camp, substance, and talent, making this CD both unique and memorable, even after several listenings.  When this album falters -- and it does occasionally -- it regains its balance almost immediately.
0807014273|5.0|From the perspective of a member in a culture consumed in the \\"existential vacuum\\", Frankl's experiences and logotheraphy discussion offers a call to action for those prepared to live a meaningful life. This book will change you.
B000YAA68C|4.0|I thought this movie was fantastic. Great moral behind the story and just an overall great cast. I agree with others that with Swank, it's hard for her to be so goofy and funny because she plays such a great serious actress in most of her films, but she delivered this role very well. This movie was a tear jerker, Gerard Butler is hot and great actor, and he does play that perfect man.     It touched me when I realized how hard it is to be a grieving widow but how amazing to have experienced such a great love, and Gerry is her guide...    SEE IT! It's a keeper!
B000YAA68C|5.0|I saw this in the theater.  And cried the whole movie through..it was great.  A must see chick flick!
B000SEGCRS|4.0|I downloaded the sample to my Kindle and only received the part of the table of contents.  It may be better to start the samples with the first chapter, not the beginning of the book.  Because this is the second book that's had that particular problem on the Kindle.    After checking the book out at the local library, found it helpful.      I found the book's humor tiresome.  But I liked the easy to understand explanations.   The book is geared toward the Nikon and the Canon.  So if you don't have either of those models of camera, I'd suggest having your manual handy while you read.    He did a good job explaining pictures by taking shots from different angles, explaining time of day, use of background, etc which can be applied to any camera.  Using a tripod and a remote shutter release also was included.    However, when it came to the settings, some of them would work, and some wouldn't.  For example, he said to set your camera on f-11, and my camera only goes up to f-8.      He also explained making the conversion from film to digital.  Film users are always aware of how much each picture cost, while with a digital camera, you're only concerned with how much memory you have left and you can screen the pictures immediately deleting any poor shots as you go.    A lot of the suggested gear mentioned in the book is no longer available.    I'm glad that I was able to get the book at the library, because otherwise I wouldn't have purchased it based on the partial table of contents provided in the sample via my Kindle.    At the time of this review, the Kindle version is cheaper than getting it at half.com.  And of course, you don't need to wait to receive the Kindle version.      I'm waiting for a Kindle version of Volume 2.
B00005B36H|4.0|Lateralus is the anti-concept concept album from a band who really cannot be stratified into a genre too easily. While Aenima was a commercial success, Lateralus goes a lot deeper into the psyche.  It is often brooding, with very well-crafted song structures, and lacks the satirical nuances that pervaded Aenima (\\"learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim\\"). Still, the album shows a great deal of maturing since the straightforward and excellent, though easily accessible Opiate and Undertow albums. Indeed, taken together with the most recent 10,000 Days, Lateralus demarcates a new period for the band.<br /><br />The distinctive (and impressively precise) drumming and guitar work remain alongside, under and through Maynard's careening vocals, but the songs are clearly built differently. The feeling of the album sacrifices post-modernistic wit for melodies that build upon themselves like recursive chaos fractals. One could almost say that there is a mystical undercurrent without an attempt at making one - it is simply where the music lends itself, especially upon themes of relationship among the eternally vacuous places of our souls.

0143143492|5.0|I am not one to automatically jump on the Oprah bandwagon. I got this audio version of the book on the recommendation of a friend and so that I could listen as I made my weekly commute. Tolle's voice is one that tends to make a person sleepy, but the message was loud and clear. I am fortunate to live close to nature and find joy in the moment, but still found it very helpful and enlightening and am putting his lessons to use in every day living. I have lent it to a friend but can't wait to get it back and listen to it again. I also have the book and will use it for reference. He is a great philosopher and I am very happy to have finally come to know his message to the world and will continue to practice what I learned. This is a book every person should read.
B0000035GN|4.0|Listen, is this the BEST Sebadoh album?  Not for real Freed Weed or III fans - but then again, a lot of people find those albums creepy and downright unlistenable.  (not me, but I'm just sayin')      To ask artists to stay in any one space is not allowing them to be true to themselves - especially when people have left (Gaffney).  Was Lou selling out?  He was thinking about selling MORE, to be sure.  But like The Replacements with Pleased to Meet Me, he was selling out his way, and what came out was very interesting indeed.  Skull isn't quite September Gurls, but it's a great alterna-pop song, and songs like License to Confuse and Magnet's Coil are also very, very good.  And despite a few duds (I think there are a few on all Sebadoh's albums), this disc is generally pretty darn good thoughout.     Overall, I do prefer Freed Weed as a purer artistic statement, but I'm not throwing that disc on when I wanna rock (#1 when I want to sit alone in a dark room with some Scotch, though).  I for one am pleased with the fact that Lou and co. mixed it up - a lot of bands have 6 albums where the last 3 sound like they're trying too hard to be the first three, not so here.
0553382179|4.0|This is the best book in its league and clearly gives the instructions to a home sweet home. Especially 'the shining sink' & '15-minute sessions to focus & finish once and all' has given me the confidence & motivation to do much better at housework and  create time for other things.<br /><br />I should have given 5 star to Sink Reflections, but the fact that it is rather too precise(without much giving flexibility to the reader/follower) has made me to rate it 4 star. So, instead of realizing the book word by word, I followed the general outline -since i have my own way of doing things- and now accomplish a lot better compared to past & be ready for guests at home any time.<br /><br />The writer, Marla Ciley derived a specific jargon for this book and though some of them are funny such as CHAOS - Can't have anyone over syndrome-most of them are not.
B0013J30XG|4.0|Appropriately, Speed Racer is a movie that can't sit still. It's a jolting, shuddering, bouncing, jet-propelled juggernaut of a movie, an explosion of sound and motion and color and story and personality. Images rocket across the screen with hypnotic intensity. The laws of physics are asked to go take a hike. The very texture of the pictures on the screen refuses to stay static: Raw realism mingles with cartoonish fantasia, colorful abstraction, and CGI dreamscapes.  Its restlessness isn't just special, either. It wreaks havoc with time as well, ducking and weaving and spiraling around events through an endless wormhole of recollections, cut scenes, flashbacks-within-flashbacks, and even a hallucination or two. The opening scene, for example, is an absolute narrative labyrinth, simultaneously relating something in the neighborhood of three overlapping storylines from about half a dozen differing perspectives, cramming humor, action, tragedy, suspense, drama, and raw excitement into a stunningly narrow framework. And then there are the characters, who are so much larger than life that it's hard to believe. The techno-fueled soundtrack, which revamps the original show's theme music (and throws in the guitar solo from \\"Free Bird\\" for good measure), is similarly explosive.<br /><br />It's an absolute sensory overload of a movie, a vicious Magic Eye painting, a comic book come brutally to life.  It can make viewers drool. It completely transcends that tired clich&eacute; about \\"jumping off the screen,\\" because that's not what it does. Instead, it sucks viewers into the screen, all but daring them to hang on to their senses as they experience its four electrified dimensions. It's a glorious head-trip.<br /><br />Needless to say, it's also entertaining as hell. If you're a fan of the classic TV show, then you'll be pleased to find that the movie retains that anime's sense of suspense, excitement, humor, and endearingly cheesy embellishment. The race scenes pummel viewers with everything described in the above two paragraphs, while the less intense moments offer a bevy of dazzling eye candy and surreal scenery. The cast is great, too: John Goodman is perfect as Pops Racer, Christina Ricci makes for a wonderfully bubbly Trixie, and Paulie Litt is hilarious and adorable as Speed's younger brother Spirtle. Roger Allam wonderfully unpleasant as the film's villain, and Matthew Fox is appropriately wooden as (The Mysterious) Racer X. There's also a cool monkey. And I don't even like monkeys all that much.<br /><br />It's pure style over substance, of course. It's the epitome of reliance on special effects and glitzy scenery. It's nothing more than a feast for the eyes, a bludgeoning rush of computerized fireworks without much in terms of plot, characterization, or message. And sometimes, that's exactly what we all want. Go Speed Go.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|My wife loves it. I don't watch it, but I bought ir for her and she was ecstatic.
B000784WMW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the original Jane Eyre book, and I have long been looking for a movie that does proper justice to it. At last, I have found it! This movie had a great cast, and was very close to the book. The only points they altered were so minimal that it didn't matter one way or the other. The acting was truly superb, Timothy Dalton IS Mr. Rochester. While he was too handsome for the role technically, he did such a magnificent job on the acting that I love it anyway! :) I would HIGHLY recommend this movie if you are a fan of the book.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|\\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" has to be Rihanna's greatest album ever. It's got a mixture of dance, pop, and R&B. The songs are amazing and Rihanna sounds better than ever. Here are my favorite songs from this album:    1.) Umbrella: Luv that song! Catchy tune, catchy lyrics. Who would love this?  2.) Don't Stop the Music: It has to be THE biggest dance song of the 2000's.   3.) Hate That I Love You So: I luv this song! Rihanna and Ne-Yo sound so sweet and it's got that great guitar music in the song. Luv it so much!  4.) Question Existing: The song is good, but the lyrics are kinda hard to understand. I think she's talking about how she's normal like everyone else and how it's like being in the spotlight and trying to figure out which people to trust or not to trust.  5.) Good Girl Gone Bad: Good song with great guitar music. I love the part in the song where she sings, \\"You better learn how to treat us right, 'cause once a good girl goes bad, we die forever.\\"    All in all, Rihanna did a great job on this album. She is one of the most amazingly talented female singers of all time!
B000YAA68C|4.0|Okay, I'm biased.  I bought the movie because Gerard Butler is in it.  What I discovered was a funny, sad and always emotional film.  I loved the quirkiness of Lisa Kudrow's character.  As always Gerard Butler is sweet, charming, and oh so good looking.  I was relieved they left out most of his illness, only showing one scene while Jerry was ill.<br />The music was really wonderful.  Unfortunately, in the CD Gerard's songs were not included.  His rendition of I'll Love You 'Til the End is really touching.<br />This is most definitely a chick flick, but guys should probably watch it for some romantic tips.<br />The trip to Ireland was really a nice addition to the film.  The book was placed in Ireland and so the trip was to Spain.  The producers chose to send Holly and her friends to Ireland to include it in the film and it made for a nice touch.<br />Good film and I'm happy to have purchased it.<br />JJ<br />:>)
B000VNMMWA|4.0|FUNNY,FAST-PACED,VERY GOOD MIX OF POLICE/ACTION/SLASHER MOVIE SATIRE, EXCELLENT CAST,VERY REWATCHABLE(VERY EASY TO FIND SOMETHING NEW ,THAT YOU MISSED IN A PREVIOUS SHOWING),A CLEVER COMEDY.........AN EXCELLENT MOVIE!
6305428352|5.0|Very few movies can be defined as perfect, this is one of them. None of the acting is over the top, Richard Dreyfus is exceptional in the role and there isn't a blemish on a single of the supporting actors and actresses.  Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Glenn Headley all are assets to the production.     A young Terrence Howard shows a hint of his future talent as a poor student who Holland takes under his wing and teaches the bass drum as a trade-off to the PE teacher who agrees to teach Holland's students to march.     Covering 30 years and hundreds of countless lives that he touched, the movie highlights the talent of a young Jean Louisa Kelly who can bring one to tears with her version of \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\".      The movie montages several of the strifeful events of the 60s and 70s which add context to the times with the assassination of John Lennon being the most significant considering it brings Holland and his deaf son Cole to a crossroad in their relationship.      The one aspect that was somewhat disappointing but not at all a judgement on the film is the fact that after all he had done, he was easily cast aside over budget cuts.  When we as a society simply can't afford to employ such a man who influenced so many people, it's probably time to reassess our values.
B00132D808|4.0|My first thing to note: this is not for a fan of Panic! At the disco (as opposed to Panic At The Disco). The guys really took a 180 on this album, even though their first song promises they are still the same, and have not changed, it is quite obvious that this CD is a huge transition from a fever you can't sweat out. Once, you get over a shock of what you thought you were expecting (after all, who couldn't resist the catchyness of a Fever You Can't Sweat Out? Not me.), you start to loathe this CD. Its so slow, so boring, and so not the Panic you thought you had in store. But, I promise you, after several listens, it just gets that goody mellow music you've been looking for your whole life (or maybe the past couple of months). I really feel like this is a different band, but still a great one nonetheless.
B0000541AM|5.0|This was an on time delivery of the product that I order.  It actually came a couple of days before I anticipated which made it even better.  I was giving this to someone as a gift and thought I would have to give it to them after the fact but it came before scheduled.  Thank you for the prompt shipping.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|[[ASIN:B000SFJWLU The Way of the Fist]]<br />This is an AWESOME CD!  Listen to it a few times before you judge it.  It's very different from what's out there.  After seeing them live, they are now one of my favorite bands!
B0015GDVTU|3.0|Answer: Ghost.  (Well, that's one answer, there are others too, like the film Reign Over Me, with Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle doing a male perspective of similar themes.)    P.S. I love you is a film about grief.  Grieving over the loss of a loved one, in this case Hilary Swank plays Holly who we'll see remembering her husband Gerry who has passed away from a brain tumor.  Gerry apparently had time to make plans before his death and those plans revolve around leaving behind letters to Holly providing her instructions on things she must do as she moves on from her loss.    The film opens with a brief glimpse into Holly and Gerry's happy life, though at that point we're watching a lover's quarrel over discussion of their future together.  The little glimpse gives us a bit of insight into the fact that Gerry never seemed to have a plan while Holly was trying to be incredibly organized and work towards goals she had laid out for herself and them as a couple.  Seeing that initial glimpse of their relationship and that status makes Gerry's letters and the planning he has done all the more poignant.    The movie flows fairly quickly over it's just over 2 hour running time and actually does a pretty good job of not dwelling on sadness.  Yes we know that Holly is unhappy about her loss, and yes she has issues adjusting to being alone and without the love of her life, but there isn't the depression and sadness that would drag a viewer down and leave you feeling like you just wanted the movie to end.    Along the way Holly gets instructions to journey to Ireland.  We find out there, as if we didn't know from Gerry's accent in the scenes where he appears, that the couple had met in Ireland back when Holly was a student touring the world a bit as she was trying to determine what she wanted to be in life.  Apparently they fell in love at first sight, and were destined to be together always, or at least until death parted them.    Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as Holly's mother, and other cast members perform well as Holly's sisters and friends.  The story is good, not great, but good, and the original writing shines through fairly well.  Adapted from a novel and somewhat Americanized (set in New York, rather than in Ireland), we do benefit from several beautiful scenes of the Irish countryside.    Some sexual dialogue and sparing use of language that would cause the film to earn a more adult rating, but no nudity, and little objectionable content for those concerned about such things.    Worth a rental at least.  Some may love the film and feel compelled to buy their own copy.  If you go with a disc-based copy, take a few minutes to check out the extras including a few deleted/extended scenes.  Unfortunately the deleted scenes are without introduction so viewers are left wondering where exactly they fit in the sequence of the film, but most are fairly obvious.  An introduction for each would have been nice, and one scene in particular (at the travel agency) really should have been included in some way.  Perhaps running next to the credits.  Most of the rest (outside of a reunion scene with Gina Gershon's character) are not really noticable, though that scene (with Gershon's character) probably should have made the final cut.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I am enjoying all over again the first season of The Tudors.  I had missed some episodes and found it great to see it in its entirety and know I will look forward to year two.  I really found the cast and story to be great as well as the video which was of very good quality.  It also allows the viewer to let the story become an integral part of the viewing.      Ruthie DK
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I had a very good experience in purchasing this product.  It came within the estimated delivery time and the casework and cd are in great shape.
0764574124|5.0|This book is exactly what I needed. I know several program languages so I just needed a good introduction to syntax and the basic functions. This was what I needed. Thanks.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Movie is one of the greatest movies i ever seen love everything about it, i would strongly recommend this movie on blue ray to any BD user ,,,
0307346617|5.0|This book is nothing short of brilliant. Told as an oral history very reminiscent of many history books I have read, it recounts the raise of the zombies, their taking over of the world, and the various ways in which the living push the zombies back and reclaim their countries. The one thing about this book I like is that it is, for the most part, believable. In many books dealing with alternate history, historical fiction, or fictitious history the biggest downfall is their overall premise or supposition on how events would occur are for the most part in-congruent with what would most likely take place, or at least implausible with the setting they describe. World War Z doesn't suffer from this, and while it takes the world and turns in in ways I wouldn't see coming, I kept thinking \\"yea, that seems right\\". For example, the way the chaplains turned zombie occupied Russia into a religious based country reminiscent of Tzarsist Russia I found fascinating and completely believable.<br /><br />The book doesn't stay with any one character or place, and instead jumps from person to person covering all levels of the conflict from Geo-political, tactical, strategic, personal, with the characters being as varied as they could possibly be. Some are unlikable others you root for, much as you would with any random selection of people. The book also ends with a follow-up on a majority of the characters introduced giving you a \\"where are they now\\" look back.<br /><br />The thing that amazed me most is that this book is written by Max Brooks, the son of Mel Brooks. He also wrote The Survivalists Guide to Surviving the Zombie Apocalypses, which is more tongue and cheek then World War Z and would seem more the Brooks style. I say that not to take anything away from Max. He is a talented writer, very creative, and has written the best zombie fiction I have read yet, and being the connoisseur of zombie fiction I have read a lot.
0143038419|1.0|Okay, so the ending was a little schmultzie...or maybe I'm just envious...but the book was terrific, inspirational, motivational, transformational, ya-da, ya-da, ya-da. Oh yeah, and it was funny, too. I'm on my second time through, bought it for a gift and have recommended it to many. Enjoy!
B00006AW2J|5.0|It is hard to argue that this is not the Stones finest (I love \\"Let It Bleed\\" and most Mick Taylor Stones.) I won't.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Considering that Annie Lennox released her first solo album [[ASIN:B000002VMH Diva]] shortly after the Eurythmics disbanded, you would think that she wouldn't take so long with subsequent releases. True, the three-year gap before [[ASIN:B000002VUC Medusa]] came out wasn't a HUGE break, but [[ASIN:B000089RVU Bare]] didn't appear until 2003. Now, Annie comes at us with her fourth album, Songs of Mass Destruction.<br /><br />Although some of the songs on here are a little dark, they aren't as blatant as what was found on much of Bare (which isn't a bad album, by the way). Such songs include \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\", \\"Lost\\" and \\"Dark Road\\". And Annie's activism also has a presence on here, as evidenced by the feministic tracks \\"Sing\\" and \\"Womankind\\".<br /><br />Another good selection is the final track, \\"Fingernail Moon\\". Speaking of which, as was the case with most of her post-Eurythmics albums, there are mainly ballads on here, and when she shoots for funky tracks, she hits (\\"Ghosts in My Machine\\") and misses (\\"Love is Blind\\"). Her vocals go a little off-key from time to time too. Oh, well; while Diva remains her best solo album, Songs of Mass Destruction proves that Annie's talent is still going strong.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000AM1TGC|5.0|Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett released his first solo album in November of 1975 in the UK and January of 1976 here in the US entitled Voyage of the Acolyte.<br />The reason for Voyage of the Acolyte was because Genesis lead singer Peter Gabriel quit the band in May of 1975 at the end of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour and the band faced an uncertain future. With Genesis MIA, Hackett went to the recording studio between June and July of 1975 to record his solo debut.<br />The album, musically, would not have sounded out of place in the Genesis canon as Hackett is joined by Genesis mates Phil Collins on drums and vocals and Mike Rutherford on bass guitar and 12-string guitars. In addition to the album consisting of Genesis (sans keyboard player Tony Banks) are Steve's brother John Hackett on flute, ARP synthesizers and bells, extra keyboard player John Acock, art rock musician Mike Oldfield's sister Sally Oldfield (soprano sounding vocal on \\"Shadow of the Hierophant\\"), Robin Miller on horns and cellist Nigel Warren-Green.<br />When I first heard this album in January of 2000 (when I first acquired the CD), I knew I was in for a treat.<br />We begin with the instrumental \\"Ace of Wands\\" which is a stellar piece of music (especially Collins' drumming, Hackett's guitar and the bass of Rutherford) which goes through different music textures, time signatures and is amazing. Next is \\"Hands of the Priestess (Part 1)\\" which is a nice laid back instrumental suite. Then we segue into \\"A Tower Struck Down\\" which is an excellent piece of music which is amazing. Then we go into sound effects which in affect we go to \\"Hands of the Priestess (Part 2)\\" which is a continuation of Part 1. The first half of the album ends with \\"The Hermit\\" which featured Hackett on lead vocals and he wasn't sure about his singing so he sings it in a deep voice.<br />The album's second half kicks off with \\"Star of Sirius\\" which includes Phil Collins on all vocals (which was a precursor to what he would do in Genesis as of 1976's A Trick of the Tail and eventually later in his own solo career) and sounds like an outtake from The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and is my favorite piece on the album. Next is the instrumental \\"The Lovers\\" which is short but sweet.

B00011RPB0|1.0|This movie was NOT slow paced,.............it was NON existent!  There was No movie, NO plot, NO nothing.  It just went on and on, and there was no point at ALL . A complete wast of Time!!!!
B00006DEF9|5.0|I'm in my mid-twenties, and I have really enjoyed the musicals Hollywood had produced recently (\\"Chicago\\", \\"Phantom\\", \\"Hairspray\\").  I haven't seen a lot of \\"older\\" musicals, but I have seen \\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\\", and I enjoyed that.  I guess that those things combined led me to seek out some of Hollywood's \\"classic\\" musicals, and \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" was the first one I thought of.    I'm glad that was the case, because I really enjoyed it.  It had great dancing and singing, wonderful acting, physical comedy, and a good message.  It made me smile so many times I lost count of the smiles.  I'd never seen a Gene Kelly film, but now that I have, I understand why so many people speak fondly of him.  I enjoyed Debbie Reynolds' performance, but in truth, it was Donald O'Connor's performance that I'll remember for the longest.  His dancing, singing voice, and most of all, his facial expressions, were fantastic.      So, if you're like me - someone who has seen the new group of Hollywood musicals and is wondering if you'd enjoy the older ones, too - I highly recommend \\"Singin' in the Rain\\".  Go for it!
B00005JN0T|5.0|I'm surprised that, overall, this movie is only getting a rating of 3.5 stars.  I really enjoy it, and so does the rest of my family.  (We're between 15 and 49.)  The story is good, the acting is good, and I think the movie carries a message relevant to today, as our society becomes increasingly mechanized/reliant on machinery.      What I like most about this movie is that it's action-packed without being too bloody or overly profane.  I'm really squeamish, and I don't care for swear words, and lately, a lot of movies that are action-packed tend to involve one or both of those things, so I found iRobot to be a breath of fresh air.      However, parents of fairly young children beware - there is a shower scene involving Will Smith that you might feel is inappropriate for your kids.  You don't see \\"the real thing\\", but there is a lot of skin visible.    Overall, I recommend iRobot highly.  I think you'd enjoy it.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I saw \\"Miss Potter\\" on cable recently, and wondered if it had ever been in theatrical release, and if so, why wasn't it given more attention? If you liked \\"Finding Neverland\\" and its magical feel and look, you will love \\"Miss Potter\\". Okay, I admit I read all of her books as a young child, and loved the stories and illustrations, and seeing this film makes me want to read the books again! Like Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie in \\"Finding Neverland\\", Zellweger plays Beatrix Potter who, though \\"grown up\\" takes pure joy in her total dedication to her inner child and is not ashamed to do so, in spite of much criticism for her reluctance to lead a \\"normal\\" life. The film is beautifully photographed and acted and draws us into both Potter's \\"real\\" life and her fantasy life she shares with \\"her friends\\", i.e., her beautiful little illustrations that delight us with their life-like, often unexpected animations. Just as \\"Finding Neverland\\" whisks us away to childhood innocence and teaches us to fly, \\"Miss Potter\\" leads us down a similar path with a similar message: WHY do we have to leave childhood in the past? Both Depp and Zellweger never cease to amaze me with their range of acting because I never catch them reminding me that what I am seeing is nothing other than the truth. And that's my idea of total entertainment. Sit back, believe in Potter's \\"friends\\" and unless you are made of stone, you are a child again, even if only for a little while.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|\\"Oracular Spectacular\\" is a fun CD.  The music is bouncy and free-flowing, and most decidedly uncommercial.<br /><br />The lyrics of the opening track, \\"Time to Pretend,\\" seem to describe where the members of MGMT have found themselves.  The lyrics say:<br /><br />This is our decision, to live fast and die young.<br />We've got the vision, now let's have some fun.<br />Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do.<br />Get jobs in offices, and wake up for the morning commute.<br /><br />The members of MGMT realize that they are on a roller coaster, being hailed as \\"the next new thing\\" by many, though they are just doing their thing.  For now, they are just going with the flow.  The music is fast with fun electronic effects, but is tinged with a fatalism that provides an interesting emotional counterpoint to the enthusiasm of the music.  This opening told me that this group was different and that I was likely going to enjoy this CD.<br /><br />One of the things I love about the lyrics is that they are psychedelic and frequently make little sense, if any.  The lyrics of \\"Weekend Wars\\" mostly make no sense.  Here is one short example of the lyrics of this song:<br /><br />Was I?  I was too lazy to bathe<br />Or paint or write or try to make a change.<br />Now I can shoot a gun to kill my lunch<br />And I don't have to love or think too much.<br /><br />Little repetition and lots of creativity are the hallmarks of MGMT's lyrics.  The music for this song sounds very retro, with strong 60's influences.  Portions of this music have a beat reminiscent of The Beatles and The Monkees, with an interesting psychedelic overlay and a smattering of 80's and 90's influences.  The result seems simultaneously old and new.<br /><br />\\"The Youth\\" shows influences from Alice Cooper and 60's youth culture music.  The music is quite interesting, with electronic effects, feedback and a good guitar riff.  The vocals are often manipulated electronically, which, when combined with the music, creates a song with a lot of variety.  Though the ending repetitions go on a little too long for my taste, I enjoy this song.<br /><br />The song \\"Electric Feel\\" is one of my favorites on this CD.  This song has a nice pop flavor that reminds me of 80's pop.  Though the music is derivative, the beat is heavy and the music catchy and the lyrics are marvelous.<br /><br />There is something about \\"The Kids\\" that seems poignant and sad.  I think this song is about children from a parent's perspective, remembering a time when their children were little, fearless and innocent.  Perhaps MGMT is also considering how their parents might have felt watching them grow up, and maybe longing for some of that lost innocence themselves.  The beat is strong and electronic, showing influences from 1980's music.  I like this song because it is mellow and introspective.<br /><br />I enjoy the surreal lyrics of \\"4th Dimension Transition.\\"  The psychedelic music of this song pays homage to groups such as The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, and Cream.  The musical style is straight from the late 1960's and yet it sounds fresh.  I could probably say more about this song, but it is better experienced than explained.<br /><br />The change from the previous song to \\"Pieces of What\\" is disconcerting because the styles are so different.  This song contains flavors of Dylan and The Beatles.  There may be a touch of country influence.  Though the style and tempo are different, the lyrics still contain a surreal feel to them.  Portions of the lyrics make sense, but they fail to be fully comprehensible.  This song is not one of my favorites on this CD.  I think the vocals are weaker and the understated music sets this song too far apart from the more bombastic music surrounding it.  Fortunately, this song is also the shortest on this CD.<br /><br />Another song with a strong feel of the 1960's is the surreal song \\"Of Moons, Birds and Monsters.\\"  This song seems to have influences from psychedelic artists from the 1960's, but there is also a progressive feel to this song that reminds me of Pink Floyd, King Crimson and The Moody Blues.  I like the mellow feel and the electronic vocal manipulations.  The last half of this song is a marvelous instrumental and lets me hope that MGMT might some day try longer efforts with even more progressive influences, or perhaps they could go completely progressive.<br /><br />The lyrics to \\"The Handshake\\" are poetic and evocative.  The opening of this song reminds me of \\"Crimson and Clover\\" by Tommy James and the Shondells.  However, this song has five different styles from the beginning to an end that sounds a lot like Fleetwood Mac.  This song is a lot of fun to listen to because of the changes in styles that seem influenced by progressive rock and a variety of classic rock artists.<br /><br />The final track is completely different from anything else on this CD, and is just as enjoyable.  There are psychedelic touches overlaid on a Beatlesque pop sensibility that I liked.  \\"Future Reflections\\" continues the pattern of previous songs, containing virtually incomprehensible lyrics and catchy music.  The only thing I did not like in this song was the ending, where \\"alone\\" is repeated too often with a high falsetto that quickly became annoying to me.<br /><br />MGMT is a pair of extremely creative young men, Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden, who seem able to sit down and bang out a song with little apparent effort.  While the results may fall short of great, it is enthusiastic and a treat for people longing for some of the originality of the 60's and 70's.  Given the opportunity, I suspect these two individuals will be a force in rock music for many years to come.<br /><br />This enhanced CD also includes a video of electric touch and photos.  The video is a lot of fun!<br /><br />Enjoy!nd The Moody Blues.  I like the mellow feel and the electronic vocal manipulations.

B0000CDLC8|3.0|1. the dvd-audio sounds a bit compressed and bright. needs to sound fatter.    2. the subwoofer needs to be turned up a tad.    3. where are robert plant talking through the whole concert?? thats a big part of zeppelin live.    other than this its cool :)
B0013BOS6W|4.0|I understand that not everyone liked this movie.  It's not the typical cheary everything is going to be all right movie.  It shows how not everything is easy.  It's not the typical happy ending.  But it leaves you knowing that everyone is going to be ok, and eventually it does all work out.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|after hail to the thief i had given up on that ok computer sound. when i heard in rainbows i thought it was better than what they had done in years but i just have to realize.there will never be an ok computer or the bends again from these guys.    i will keep buyin their cds and enjoying,but my obsession is over.

0385335997|5.0|Okay, I said that \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\" was my favorite in the series, but after reading the first three books for a second time, I think that \\"Voyager\\" is now the favorite by the slightest margin. Claire undergoes the time travel for the second time after she discovers that Jamie survived the battle of Culloden. When I finally got to the scene when Jamie and Claire were reunited, I couldn't breathe. Never was a moment in literature so anticipated and so enthralling that you can't help but read it over again and again. And then there was the when Claire finds out that Jamie is married, and the greatest (and hottest) fight scene goes down between the two. I read that scene about four times.    Like the previous two books, Gabaldon keeps you entertained from front to back, just one adventure right after the other. You even wonder how she comes up with all of this stuff. Only the imagination of a literary goddess has that ability.     I have Voyager and the rest in the series like my grandma had \\"Gone with the Wind\\" when she was a young woman. God bless Diana Gabaldon and her ability to spin such a lovely, fascinating tale about two people so in love, a love that should be experienced by everyone.
B00005B5L4|5.0|this is one of my best sounding dvd-a's. the surround is also very cool.    the addition of silver springs was great and should have been on the original LP.     only 1 gripe    1. never going back again should have been the original way not this drum marching sound with weak guitar bits they added.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|You had the DVD in stock and I received it within the timeframe that it was promised to me.    Thank you.
0671449028|5.0|I love this book.  I love to read it to my little boy before we go to bed.  It is a nice, short, sweet little book going through the bedtime routine of a bunch of cute little animals.   It rhymes and flows well.  I really have nothing bad to say about any of Sandra Boynton's work.  In the three years we've had it the cover has worn a lot, but the inside pages have held up really well and are in great condition.

B0010VD7EO|5.0|MGMT, (formerly The Managment) is a New York based band that is in that rarified world of psychodelia. I am sure they are a killer live show, these bands by and large are made or broken on their live show.    That said (and with the acknowledgement I will never see one of their shows live because of my profound allergy to certain types of smoke) I really love this style of music. And this particular band's approach, which is more Oasis than The Dead, is a fine example of the breed.    Lyrically, they're fairly impenetrable (though I get the subtle references to certain types of drug use) but even if I don't understand much of what is being said, I do enjoy the way they say it.    The vocals are fairly standard, but are presented well. The best song (IMHO) is Kids. The walking base line and missive about keeping your carbon footprint small is catchy in the extreme.    I hardily recommend this to all lovers of music that tickles your frontal lobes.
1596912855|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Shannon Hale has a great sense of humor and can totally laugh at herself in this book (and we can laugh at ourselves for wishing we were in the same kind of situation).  I think most people who are obsessed with Austen books--and especially the movies--will really enjoy this book, but only if you can see the humor in the situation and not take it too literally, like some reviews I've seen.  Just enjoy the ride!
B00007E8O5|5.0|[[ASIN:B00007E8O5 Degradation Trip Volumes 1 & 2]]  This is a fantastic album. I've been an Alice in Chains fan for years and recently I picked up Jerry's first solo album (Boggy Depot). If you haven't heard that one, get it. It really shows how creative Jerry is. However, Degradation Trip far exceeds Boggy Depot. With almost 2 1/2 hours of music on the two disc (the real) version, it's hard to believe that there is no point at which the music becomes boring. Each song is vastly different from each other and - with several songs reaching the seven minute mark - it's impressive that Cantrell constantly keeps the listener guessing. If you're familiar with Alice in Chains, you may know Jerry's somewhat unconventional songwriting style which employs multiple choruses and verses of varying length; Jerry uses these methods expertly to create songs which range from relatively short hard-rocking tunes to epic ballads. If you're a fan of Alice in Chains or of Jerry's riffing and songwriting skills, this album is a must have.     Although I really think every song on this album is great in its own way, my personal favorites include: Locked On (great use of talk-box), Angel Eyes (amazing mix of acoustic and electric guitars), Chemical Tribe (a great example of Jerry's songwriting prowess), and Hurts Don't It? (an amazing instrumental composition reminiscent of Whale & Wasp from the AIC EP Jar of Flies).    I don't know what else I can say except I haven't been able to stop listening to this album since I bought it. It really is a great album and Jerry puts such emotion into his singing. The subject matter ranges from Layne's horrible addictions to Jerry's questioning of his own self-worth with plenty in between.     Bottom line: get this album, you won't be disappointed.     One thing to keep in mind is that Jerry recorded the whole album on a 4 track recorder in his home, making the album even more impressive.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I saw this movie before purchasing and was completely delighted with it. It was well done with an excellent cast.  The storyline was well presented, although not exactly in line with the book.  I liked both the movie and the book for their own qualities, although I have to complain about making Mr. Thornton look meaner in the movie than he actually was in the book.  He was way too good looking to stay mad at, though. The storyline reminds me strongly of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and the evolution of feelings the lead characters have to go through to find their love for each other.  I saw the movie before reading the book, and it helped me to get through the somewhat heavy language of Elisabeth Gaskell and would recommend that same course of action for others who are interested in reading the book.
B00003ETIF|2.0|I watched this movie 20 years later after the original release (1961) at a small town. I'm lucky that I had a chance to watch it in the cinema then. Now I got three DVD versions, i.e. from Vina, Digiview and the last one from D3k. I bought the D3k release from Amazon Marketplace (used item with very good condition (as claimed by the seller) from gohastings (Hastings Entertainment) thru third party (I can't buy it directly) and contrarily I got the very bad DVD condition: I can't watch the movie from chapter 3 onward).    Many movie lovers know that this movie is excellent. Too many reviewers praised the acting of the stars, the story/script, the photography, and the music. So, I will not repeat it again here. Only one thing to be straighten. That's Kid Rio (Marlon Brando) was not released from the jail in Sonora, Mexico 5 years later. But he run away from the jail with his partner Chico Modesto (played by Larry Duran).    For the product of D3k, the correct running time is 141 minutes instead of 117 minutes as stated in the back cover of the DVD. The positive aspect of this product of D3k is that it has English and French subtitles. Other releases has no subtitles at all. Only D3k release complete with subtitles. Picture and sound is not so good, but it's still watchable. Despite the fact that it's in full screen (1.33:1), the picture format is actually in Pan & Scan; too bad transfer since the movie is originally in Panavision. So, widescreen is the best aspect ratio.      I hope that Paramount will release the DVD complete with the subtitles, including English subtitle. So many people waiting, hoping and wanting the official release of this box-office movie in DVD format by Paramount. It doesn't need to release the DVD on the 50 Years Anniversary in 2011! We're not patience.    The DVD: 2.5  The Movie: 10!
B000244FDW|5.0|I saw this production many years ago when it first showed on PBS.  After watching the Colin Firth A & E version numerous times, the memory of this one had faded somewhat.  Except, of course, for how cute Elizabeth Garvie is!!!  Watching her brought back good memories.  Seriously, I had always wanted to see it again and I'm glad that I purchased it.  While it may be slightly different from the A & E version in its own way its just as good.  It is interesting to watch this one and compare the various characters with the A & E version.  The mother is not as hysterical.  Mr Collins is not as goofy.  The father is definitely much more cynical, sarcastic and bitter.  I didn't despise this Catherine DeBourgh and Mr Wickham as much as in the A & E production.  Concerning Jane and Bingley I have no opinion.  Their blandness transends time and interpretations.  The Bingley ladies here are definitely much more nasty and condescending.  I wholeheartedly recommend adding this DVD to your Pride & Prejudice/Jane Austen collection.
0783225849|4.0|A slick, taught psychological thriller. Seminal cinema. I had avoided watching this film for a long time after a friend of mine told me it was 'kind of obvious who the killer is'. Well yes and no. From the cautious, careful opening scenes, to the moment the mysterious motel/house location is established, it is clear that this is not the type of billion dollar bloodbath slasher thriller with ludicrous twists, turns, subplots, denouments. It is a closed world - dominated by the disturbed young man Norman Bates: quirky, uneasy, boyishly handsome - and his relationship with his elderly invalid mother who dominates his mind.<br /><br />Original for its shape (the shower scene is only a third of the way through) and its intelligent and brilliant epilogue of psychological ideas after a thrilling seat clutching climax, Psycho is a must.
0767812387|3.0|Latin heartthrob Chayanne can sing. Chayanne can dance. Chayanne can teach Ricky Martin a thing or two about moving the hips. But, Chayanne cannot act very well. Vanessa Williams basically has to carry the movie because Chayanne, when he is not dancing...does very little for the film. But, when Chayanne is dancing all the bets are off. The passion in the dance sequences is palpable, the dancing is amazing and darn...it looks like fun!<br /><br />The film's plot has been done in many many other films. So, it is not only predictable, it is downright scene by scene a what every dance movie til then and since then has done. But, don't watch it for the predictable plot. The strengths of this movie lies in the dancing...because it is Latin hot! Trust me, I am Latin ;-)
0765357151|5.0|This story was excellent! I thought the author did a fine job of capturing the thoughts and feelings of the last human on Earth. Robert Neville is a believable guy - he mumbles to himself, procrastinates, and drinks heavily so he doesn't have to face the horrors around him. He shows a wide range of emotions, changing from his very sensitive nature in the time before the plague to the hard and bitter person he's become. I especially liked how he'd continue to form attachments to things that would kill him just to stay sane. Since Neville is the only real character in the novel, Matheson has to capture him just right. I think he succeeded.<br /><br />Also, I loved Matheson's treatment of the vampire legends. His scientific approach was a great idea done well. These were probably the most interesting parts of the book.  But by far my favorite parts were those where Neville was dealing with the living, and he shed his cold exterior to show some real depth. This was all brilliantly written and quite emotional.<br /><br />If I had to make a complaint, I'd say that the details of Neville being attracted to the vampire women was over the top, but fortunately that tapered off within the first third of the book.<br /><br />The ending was, of course, very solid. In fact I appreciated the entire pacing and organization of the book. It was gripping and read quickly and easily.<br /><br />My copy is actually half I Am Legend and half other short stories, though this isn't marked and confused me greatly when I reached the ending.  Reading the rest of the short stories here, I see that Matheson is actually a horror writer, and was taking a step out of his element to write this book. It's quite an accomplishment. (Incidentally I have not read horror stories before, but I was somewhat creeped out by these, so I guess that's something...)<br /><br />A final comment: after reading the book I still have no problems with the different story presented in the movie. Many people complain about the changed ending, but really the movie changed quite a bit about the book, to the point where the only things in common are the title and the fact that the main character is a lone survivor. They clearly set out with different messages in mind, and developed the story in their own logical ways. Just as putting the movie ending on the book would make no sense, so would trying to use the book ending with the movie. I enjoyed them both equally, but in different ways.ovie changed quite a bit about the book, to the point where the only things in common are the title and the fact that the main character is a lone survivor.

076781214X|4.0|\\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\" is a classic. It is a great, funny and cute film. Who would have thought that Coppola could produce something as good as this and do it successfully. Peggy Sue is going to her high school reunion. She hits her head and revisits her high school days. Peggy Sue has a choice, travel the once traveled path (get pregnant young and end in a broken marriage) or take the alternate route. Will she follow her heart or her head? Will she rediscover love? This is a great film. Kathleen Turner is great in it as the too- mature- for- her- age- because- she- has- already- lived- it-teenager and Nicholas Cage is great at playing the brainless, funny and just about confused teenager and adult. This is one of the only Nicholas Cage movies I like. The film is succeeds because it has great character development and a very well carried out storyline. It is a movie that is good to this day.
0312360266|3.0|Overall, Marked was a decent beginning to a new YA supernatural series. I liked the concept of a world only a half step away from our own, where everything (including fashion, television shows, and even famous celebrities) is the same as our own, except there vampires have always existed. It did lead me to wondering over a few historical questions, but in general I didn't have a problem with the idea.<br /><br />The story centers around Zoey Redbird and her struggles to fit into her new school, the House of Night, after she has been marked as a vampyre fledgling. Zoey learns to navigate the tricky waters of fledgling society, makes a new group of friends (and even finds a new boyfriend), earns the favor of the vampyre goddess Nyx, and learns to stand up for what she knows is right, all while trying to deal with social enemies and extricate herself from the ties to her old life.<br /><br />As a character, I like Zoey. At the start, her voice and mannerisms annoyed me a little bit, until I got used to them. By the end of the first third of the book, though, I had gotten used to her, and was definitely on her side. I like that she's tough and she thinks quickly on her feet. She tries to rise above the pettiness and cruelty of Aphrodite and her \\"friends,\\" and she does her best to deal with the surprises life throws at her, even if her choices have unintended consequences, like with her former boyfriend, Heath. I really like the characters of her friends, too. They're quirky and individual and real, especially Stevie Rae and Damien.<br /><br />The plot seemed well developed, and ended with hints of darkness and danger to come.<br /><br />There are a few things that seemed nagging to me, though, and they're all small characterizations issues. A lot of the characters in the book are not fully fleshed out, and are very flat characters, like Zoey's family (except her grandmother) and friends from her old life. Even characters from her new life are flat, like Erik; his motivations for suddenly being so drawn to Zoey are never explained, especially as she's the rival of his ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />It was a decent book; I found myself reading quickly and wanting to find out what happened to Zoey and her friends at the end of the story.rawn to Zoey are never explained, especially as she's the rival of his ex-girlfriend.

0061537934|5.0|[[VIDEOID:21157311]]This morning, my wife and I learned that our son has been diagnosed with speech delay. He is our first child, and we've never been through something like this before. It is easily one of the most difficult days of my life.<br /><br />This evening, after we put him to bed, I settled into the last 100 pages of Garth Stein's The Art of Racing in the Rain. The story concerns one family's near total collapse as seen through the eyes of the family dog, Enzo. It is filled with more emotion than any other novel I have read recently, and it shines with wit, humor, and poignancy.<br /><br />Narrated by Enzo the dog, we are brought into the home of the Swifts -- Denny, Eve, and Zoe -- as Denny works to realize his dream to become a race car driver. Soon though, we learn that Eve has cancer and is going to die. Denny, who possesses tremendous compassion, patience, and selflessness, gives up his dream to race cars in order to take care of Eve in her final months.<br /><br />But Garth Stein ratchets the emotional screws tighter, and Eve chooses to leave Denny and live with her parents in her final months. To make matters worse, she takes Zoe with her, and Denny is left alone with Enzo.<br /><br />Just when Denny's situation can't get any worse, it does. His in-laws inform him that they're going to file for custody of his daughter, and they intend to fight him brutally in court to do so.<br /><br />It would be wrong to give too much of the second half of this novel away, but let me just say this: if this novel doesn't make you cry, you should have someone check your heart to see if it's still beating.<br /><br />The Art of Racing in the Rain is easily one of the most human and compassionate novels I've read in a long time. Harper Executive Editor Jennifer Barth compares it to Charlotte's Web, an appropriate choice for a lot of reasons. If I had to draw a comparison, I'd pick Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men... by virtue of the fact that both novels are short, poignant, sad, funny, and ultimately brilliant. And both stories are models of grace under pressure.<br /><br />Congratulations to everyone at Harper and to the folks at Folio Literary Management for bringing this novel to publication. And congratulations most of all to Garth Stein.<br /><br />This is an outstanding novel, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />Author of [[ASIN:1440495343 CLAWS: A Suspense Novel]]oth stories are models of grace under pressure.

0767827791|3.0|Some people are saying that this is only released in Full Screen.  I rented it and it certainly was in 2:35 Widescreen.  I rented this because I wanted to see another early William Holden film, and I heard that this was a \\"classic\\".  Plus I wanted to see some films that I actually know the main song more than just the film.  The song \\"Moonglow\\" and the Theme from Picnic\\" was a classic favorite of mine in my many instrumental classics collections.  It's funny how much of my favorite music was popular before I was even born.<br /><br />Well anyway, I like William Holden's \\"The World of Suzie Wong\\" and \\"Love is a Many-Splendered Thing\\" better than this less-than-energetic \\"Smalltown Sunday at the Park\\" yawner.  Kim Novak was gorgeous, of course, and it was great to see an early film of Cliff Robertson (better known to me as in \\"Falcon Crest\\", \\"Class\\", and also for promoting AT&T about 20 years back.<br /><br />I wish William Holden didn't keep calling Kim Novak \\"baby\\" in the film.  That's so lame, but I guess that was of its time.  This movie was worth watching once, but it's certainly no keeper.
B000U7169M|3.0|Well, it has been said in the other reviews.  Yes, it's deriviative, little pieces sliced from The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby, The Prophecy, et. al.  But what movie in this vein (sorry, couldn't resist) isn't derivative?  Is there anything new under the sun?  On the whole, I found it entertaining, which is all I would ask for from such a genre.  One little gripe:  don't these \\"scientists\\" watch CSI?  They should have been able to determine whether or not the river was blood just like Grissom would!
1416563156|3.0|Meant to be a reproduction of the journal given to him by his father in the first episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, this book chronicles some of the adventures of Indy from age 9 onward.<br />I was disappointed to see how little of the series was touched on in it, but happy to see some events from the 1990's novel series and the Dark Horse comics Fate of Atlantis included.<br />While this is a book I will definitely have lots of fun looking at while watching the films, it could very easily have been two or three times thicker.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|And with her latest creation - \\"Hard Candy\\" - she has once again given us something new and creative to listen too.    I will readily admit, when I first listened to her last so-so album, \\"American Life\\", I thought it was really, really bad.  But, after I listened to it a few times, I came to realize how wonderful practically every song on that album really was (or is).    \\"Hardy Candy\\" was just as hard a piece to swallow as \\"American Life\\" was - at first.  But each time I listen to the various songs on it, I like them more and more.    For me at least, Madonna appears to refrain from giving her fans an easy path to truly liking her music at first glance (or listen).  Is it smart of her to do this?  Probably not for some.  But, if you're a true Madonna fan, you should by now have come to appreciate Madonna's ability to pull you into her rythmic songs whether you want to be pulled in or not.    Is every song on \\"Hard Candy\\" all that good?  Nope, resoundingly no!  But it all blends together to tell story, which practically EVERY one of Madonna's albums have consistently down time after time.  And to anyone who says the song \\"Miles Away\\" isn't all that good, have you realy listened to the lyrics?  This song is so true in SO MANY WAYS for so many people in broken or troubled relationships.    At first, I didn't care much for \\"Candy Shop\\".  Then I truly listened to what she singing about, and now I'm taken back to \\"Erotica\\" and the sexy sensual grinding bumps in that song that I can't help but LOVE \\"Candy Shop\\" if for nothing else in that it is pure raw sensuality.    \\"Give it to Me\\" has got to be one of the best, or most likely dance tracks on the album.  Classic Madonna.  \\"Heartbeat\\" is a close second on this score.    \\"She's Not Me\\", \\"Incredible\\", and \\"Spanish Lesson\\" are all fun, cheeky stabs at social commentary of sorts.  They are all very catchy once you've absorbed what she's singing about in each song.    I'm not usually very fond at white peoples' attempts at 'Spanish style' music, and I wasn't too fond of \\"Spanish Lesson\\" at first, but it really is a beautiful social commentary in a very lyrically catchy muse.  It's FUN people - just listen to it! You know, I think I might actually be able to really learn how to speak Spanish for once if I had Madoona singing all my Spanish lessons to me like this.  It would sure be the pants out of - oh what's it called? - well you know the name of it, they advertise that CD-ROM Spanish lesson on tv all the time.  :)    \\"Dance 2night\\" is possibly the weakest track on the album, but it certainly isn't horrible, just not great.  Every artist has at least one or more poor performers on their albums.  This is one of Madonna's on her current effort.    \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You, and \\"Voices\\" are both very different, at least for me.  I love them.  Madonna has always treaded into new territory when it comes to her music.  For good, bad, or indifferent reasons, she has always delivered SOMETHING a little \\"off the beaten path\\" on every album she has every released in her career.  These last two songs (for me) are evidence of that, and I think THAT'S what has kept her relevant all of these years with so many of her long-term fans.    She's not going to please EVERYBODY with each one of her albums.  She never has managed to do that, and quite frankly, I don't honestly feel that has ever been her intention.  If you haven't gotten that about Ms. M's general attitude about her actions, and how other people feel about her actions, then you don't Madonna very well.    What she has managed to do is push the envelope, remain at the top of her game, explore new musical arenas lyrically, physically, and emotionally, and to top it all off - continue to sell albums (and sucessfully at that) despite what any one may say or feel about her newest material.    How many \\"flash-in-the-pans\\" (as Madonna was considered, and referred too back in the early 80's when her career first took off) can still be seen, heard, admired, loathed, listened too, danced too, idolized, and emulated? All the while raking in our money (and love) for their continued (and seemingly endless) flowing of \\"Music\\" in the same way that Madonna has over the past 25 years.  How many are there left and are still standing (and dancing) to show that they not only continue to create their own musuc, but live and dance to it as well right along side their die-hard fans?  None.
0446402389|4.0|This book takes a look behind the scenes of the Soviet Union circa 1953. A conflicted state security officer embarks on a murder investigation against all odds. The story is written beautifully and is worth every minute of your time reading it. The internal drama of the characters is real enough to taste and watching them go through the story, you're left breathless hoping for their success. There are few pleasant moments in this story and I would have liked a few if only to gain perspective.
0553296981|4.0|While daydreaming in class, do you ever place yourself in the shoes of another of another thirteen year old?  Perhaps another teenager in a different historical era?  \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" would allow you to do just that. This diary tells the story of a thirteen year old Jewish girl, forced to go into hiding during the Holocaust with her family of four.  Making entries every day, Anne writes of her life in hiding; documenting her feelings of love, the noises of gunshots outside her house and the changes her body and spirit continue to experience as she develops into a teenager.  She writes of normal \\"becoming a teenager obstacles\\" such as her parents treating her unfairly, the other family always picking on her and a lonely existence in the confined space.  This book does a splendid job of describing the drama that enfolds with eight people living in tight quarters.  Just as many of you may have felt trapped in your teenage life, Anne's is magnified in the \\"Secret Annex\\" of a room.<br /><br /> I believe that this book is more real than any other narrative or memoir can be due to Anne's innocence without worrying about the outside critics.  It leaves itself for you to easily empathize with the hardships of Anne with her honest accounts of observations, memories, feelings and troubles any teenager experiences, in addition to the complexity of her tragic situation.  I highly recommend this book to any teenager who hopes to understand life's hardest lessons. If there was one negative about the book, it would be the repetitive nature of some of the entries.  Many of the entries seem quite monotonous, but isn't this true of most teenagers' lives? Although this book is 304 pages, it is a quick read with it unlikely you would want to put it down.  Published in 1993 by Bantam, it still applies this day to any teenager.
0312323867|5.0|I loved this book, I thought is was great that it was written in Darcy's point of view instead of Rachel's.  A book I could not put down...it took me about a day in a half to read, my fiance was getting upset because that is all I was doing...but I just couldn't put it down!!!
B000YD7S2Q|5.0|Wonderful news from the DGG vaults. Many of us Wagner lovers are familiar with this cherished production from previous incarnations.  But this reincarnation on DVD brings out everything to new life and new focus.  Outstanding interpretations from Cheryl Studer as Elsa and Gabriele Schnaut as Ortrud.  A little less so the Lohengrin of Paul Frey but we have heard much much worse in recent times.  Gorgeous, naturalistic production and staging.  No Regietheater or Eurotrash here.  It is like balm for the eyes, ears and soul. Again. All in all, this is THE Lohengrin to own. Thank you, DGG.  Question for DGG: how much longer before you release on DVD the treasured Bayreuth TANNHAEUSER with Maestro Sinopoli, Studer and others?
B00006G8HX|4.0|Back in the 80's Star Trek really hit its stride having finally made it to the silver screen. The first film was a dark, dreary disappointment but the producers stuck with it and created a major hit with the second film, The Wrath of Khan. The next two films including the Search for Spock and The Voyage Home basically created a trilogy that in my opinion represents the apex of the entire Star Trek franchise. By adding humor into the mix and focusing on the interaction between the main characters particularly Kirk, Spock and McCoy the producers created a winning combination that will likely never be repeated. This formula worked extremely well peaking with The Voyage Home before collapsing in a smoldering heap with the moronic row row row your boat scene in The Final Frontier.<br /><br />The Search for Spock is the weakest entry in the trilogy but that doesn't mean it's weak. This was the first of two entries directed by Leonard Nimoy and they turned out to be two of the best of all the Star Trek films. Search for Spock has a more intimate feel to it with most of the action revolving around the conflict between Kirk and the Klingon Kruge. Nimoy's focus on more lighthearted action and the playful interaction of characters makes the film a real joy and contrasts well with the films darker second half.<br /><br />William Shatner is often mocked for his acting ability and this film really pushes him to the limit, in particular his reaction after the death of his son David. Shatner may be a ham but he's the kind of ham I love and to me he will always be the true Captain of the Enterprise. I also have to give special credit to Christopher Lloyd who was absolutely fantastic as Kruge. One unfortunate change was the replacement of Kirstie Alley with the forgettable Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik.<br /><br />This film is clearly created for the fans, as it should be. If you haven't watched the old episodes or The Wrath of Khan you're unlikely to get much out of this film because it's filled with in-jokes and references to the prior film. The special effects are rather dated. In particular the starships have thick black lines around them that spoil the natural effect and the scenes on Genesis scream movies set. It's a movie with fantastic moments including the classic self destruction of the Enterprise and some lengthy stretches of slowness in particular the finale on Vulcan. I have a lot of fond memories of these three films and despite some flaws recommend them all wholeheartedly.t's filled with in-jokes and references to the prior film.

B0002V7O3S|5.0|I saw a trailer for fire in the sky when I was young, can't remember how old but between ten and thirteen. I've always had a fear of the \\"Grey\\" style of aliens, mostly because I've always believed that these particular kinds of aliens exist. Maybe it's just me, maybe I've watched too many discovery channel and Learning channel specials on alien abductions. But the trailer alone gave me nightmares as a kid, and I've been wanting to see it ever since.     At least once a year I go looking for the movie in stores and at local movie rental places like Blockbuster, to no avail. not on DVD VHS or any other media. So this year I said to myself: \\"that's it! I'm just going to find it online.\\" One amazon purchase later and I'm watching a movie that's been on my mind for several years for the first time. and it won't be the last.    Fire In The Sky is a movie about a man who was once abducted by aliens. He was absolutely traumatized by the event, and had amnesia about it as well, but through a series of flashbacks he gets his memory of the event back. As he gets his memories of the event about rhe spacecraft back it's depicted to the viewer.    It's quite a good movie with stellar performances, and engaging characters. I highly recommend it. Especially to anyone that's a fan of alien movies.
0316010669|2.0|The basic idea of the book, repeated over and over again, is that sometimes people make decisions in the blink of any eye. Some of the decisions are good, and some are bad.     Profoundly superficial throughout, but well-written and kudos to Mr. Gladwell for trying.
B0018CAAN6|5.0|First off what you have to understand is that Madonna has been ahead of the curve since she has been around.  For a 25 year old let alone the 50 year old that she is.... This woman is amazing, she has constantly stayed ahead of the times by recruiting the best producers of the time & talent of the \\"generation\\" while remaining purely \\"Madonna\\"  the woman is a genius! She knows exactly who and what to recruit for her new LP's.  Danja, Kanye, and countless others are responsible for this masterpiece.  It's not without flaws \\"heartbeat\\" for instance and even some questionable songs come off initially as strange but listen a few times and you will realize what she set out to do.  Bottom line if you love dance music you owe it to yourself to buy this CD, don't download it free, buy it, you won't be disappointed except for two songs.. the spanish one and heartbeat the rest is awesome.. and purely Madonna!!!!
B0012GMXYM|5.0|I think this is my favorite Santana release. I tend to prefer the stuff from 71-74- which I think is superior musically, lyrically, and spiritually. It's not as straight ahead rock as his first few and what he would later return to starting in 78/79 with Inner Secrets and Marathon. Borboletta to me, is kind of the apex. It's the culmination of everything he'd done before it. It's not as jazzy as Caravan or Welcome, and it's not as straight ahead as the first 2 or 3. It's a great mixture of it all, which is why I think it's superior. And lyrically, although I know I'll get slammed hard for this, I think it's some of the greatest I've ever heard. Life is Anew, Practice What You Preach, and  Mirage- pretty thoughtful, sensitive, introspective, and spiritual stuff, kids.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|After waiting many years for El Cid to finally come out on DVD and not trusting prior poorly make Asian copies, I can state for the record it was worth every second.  I remember seeing this movie as a young teenager at least 10 times at the famous Wilten theater in Los Angeles on Saturday mornings and was delighted to find that it stands up to the test of time.  It is not a classic movie but for its time it provided great enterainment.  I will not go into the basic plot of the movie which is based on the Spanish legend of the Cid but I can say that it accommodated my memory of my childhood Saturday morning fun.  Great music, color, and action. With Ms Loren as the love interest and at the top of her beauty,how could a young teenage male not enjoy this film. The backgound DVD on the producer and story line explains in part why it took so long for this movie to be released on DVD. International events aside, this movie will provide ideal enterainment for the film buff.  I found this film better than the \\"Fall of the Roman Empire\\" also producted by the same film studio. Charlton Heston was at the top of his acting career at the time of the filming of El Cid and I will miss his style now that he has passed away.
0099422395|5.0|I was attracted to Baudolino mainly through my love of Eco's books on language and semiotics.  A particular interest of Eco's is also how history is interpreted (or mis-interpreted, as is often the case).  In Baudolino he takes us through the Crusades, the fall of Constantinople, and a mythological search for the paradise of Paster Johannes, which underlines much of the action and stands as the centre-point to the book's main idea - that history (the factual record of events) is (at least in the 12th century, when this story takes place) subject to the fancies of individual interpretation (from kings to paupers).  This is not a cynical book, however - what is important, as expressed at the end of the story, is that the fundamental truths and ideas of a particular time are what make the GREATER TRUTH OF HISTORY.  The nagging details, invention and personal escapades of history's little characters (like Baudolino) are but mere transitions in the great game of truth.  For all of Baudolino's experiences, his is a story that will disappear with the dust, but will in its own way, contribute to the overriding sense of the period in which he lived and played.  This, ultimately, is what history is to most of the world's population (myself included).  Most of us will leave little or nothing behind, but our tiny lives will join the great throng that sets the tone and ideas of our times.  I found Baudolino an uplifting story that rightly pokes fun at man's inconsistency, hypocrisy and, often, outright lunacy.  Above all, Baudolino teaches us that history is far, far bigger than any one individual.  This novel is, as one would expect of the man who created The Name of the Rose, a literary work, and will require attention and patience on behalf of some readers.  If you're looking for some brain fodder, then I heartily recommend it.  If, on the other hand, you like your action quick and commercial, then perhaps this isn't the book for you.  Eco is not always an easy read.  But whoever said anything worthwhile was easy.  Five stars *****
B000YABYLA|2.0|Juno is a whole lotta nuthin. Some people call it witty,funny, etc.. *YAWN*..Its not very interesting and the whole plot is pretty silly. Teenagers talk like this? Really?? Not any that I know; grunting maybe..          One reviewer called it \\"an irresponsible movie\\", I tend to agree. Getting pregnant in high school used to be a bad thing - not anymore. Now rich white people looking to adopt will run to your door if you get stuck with a baby at 16; well, if you have a white, healthy baby (They ARE worth lots of $$$)..         Juno is a whole lotta sizzle and no steak. Its not a horrible movie, but its not worthy of all the hype.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I'm not really good at reviews, so I'll keep this short:    Like most of the reviewers on this website, I loved Dummy and the other Portishead albums. Like some of the reviewers, I concur that this is not like old Portishead at all; this is a new direction, and one that, like Dummy was in its time, representative of the zeitgeist of this time.    The music is cold, alienating, and very complex. The harsher quality to the sound makes everything feel that much more deliberate; you can hear the synth, you can tell that the beats and bass were constructed artificially from ground up because it is that raw and unpolished. It brings something new to the world of music; it isn't a simple rehash of old tried-and-true gimmicks, and it feels extremely well thought out.    But at the end of the day it isn't for everyone. I'd suggest looking for samples/clips of these tracks before deciding to plonk down the cash for it.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|The characters and special effects are excellent.  This was a great series. Shame on Paramont for cancelling after only 4 seasons. I highly recommend this DVD set.
0385474547|5.0|This is an extraordinary book in its ability to narrate both a story of cultural dissonance and an overarching tale about the human condition.  Achebe's novel broaches the subject of morality, but demonstrates that even the concept of \\"evil\\" is subject to a cultural interpretive context.<br /><br />Okonkwo, the book's tragic hero, is an emblem of tradition, but also represents how tradition can be subject to the inner turmoil of the human soul.  While the Ibo people must face the threat of European missionaries, Okonkwo must confront the threat of his own misplaced hubris.  Achebe is a sympathetic voice, but is unafraid to reveal the flaws of his characters as a commentary upon our own imperfect existence.<br /><br />This is probably one of the best introductions to African fiction, precisely because the story does not limit itself to the African context. The author's  investigation of tragedy is pragmatic, yet emotionally stimulating without being romanticized. It is a book that will help the western reader more easily understand not only Nigerian tribal culture, but the power of ideas and their institutions.

0060920084|3.0|I honestly cannot put Bryson's books down. They are good reads - I've just ordered three additional Bryson books and can't wait to recieve them.     This being said - I need to re-read this book and keep a running total of just how many places he starts to go to and doesn't - because of a steep entrance fee, because of traffic, because of a plethora of reasons. I'm guessing the tally on the 'intended to' side might be greater than the tally on the 'actually experienced, as a bona fide ticket holder / road traffic warrior'. Yes, I understand what he's trying to say about Americans being easily parted with their money. However, the 'lesson' becomes annoying, and comes off as an excuse he uses to just not see many important sites first-hand.     Also, try to develop a tough skin before reading this book if you are a resident of the South - or any small town anywhere in the country that could with any stretch of the imagination be considered 'backward'. My conclusion of Bryson's absolute distain for certain places, primarally but not limited to the South, is that it is so much easier to pull comedy out of the negative than the positive. Also, people are, by nature, inclined to notice the bad before the good. Bryson, especially but not limited to this earlier work, goes with the easier cliche slam against whole peoples.     Don't get me started in his bizarre anti-elderly people stance. He goes on rants about Americans not recognizing national treasures. He's referring to architecture and landscape for the most part. And shows complete distain to the elderly. It reflects either a genuine over-zealous dislike, or an attempt at humor gone too far and repeated much too often.    All being said, I'm still gonna read his work. It's entertaining!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I would recommend this workout!  I do have to admit that, at first, I hated it.  I am 52 years old and have 60 pounds to lose, so needless to say I'm not in good shape.  The first day I did this, I was sick, the second day I thought I would pass out.  I didn't do it again for a week because I didn't think I could do it.  However during that week, I kept thinking about it.  So...I tried it again, this time a little slower than Jillian & the \\"girls\\" do it.  I have been doing it consistenly now for 2.5 weeks.  I'm still at level 1, but I can keep up with Jillian and feel like I'm ready to move on.  I have A LOT more energy and I can already feel things \\"tightening\\" up.  I look forward to doing my 20 minutes with Jillian every day when I get home from work.  For the first time in my life, I feel like I WILL lose weight & feel great.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I loved Madonna's previous CDs but this one is a HUGE disappointment! It sounds like she just didn't care at all this time around.  It is as though she recorded her vocals in LA and then someone on the other side of the world made a bunch of beats and just mashed them together. Also calling the album  \\"Hard Candy\\" and posing in wrestling attire? Not hot in the slightest. She lost it with this album and she definitely will be losing a lot of fans too.
1594489505|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I think this book is even better than the Kite Runner.

I respect Jamie Oliver a lot, as he hasn't let fame go to his head and still is devoted to helping people, whether inner-city kids or the readers of his books.  The book's a little big and heavy, but I don't mind.  It's packed with useful information!  The recipes are classy and delicious but still easy enough for a novice.
0446402389|5.0|Don't listen to the negative comments by some of the other reviewers.  They are offered by elitists who leave the impression that Mr. Smith has to go through some type of rookie initiation process before we are allowed to give him his due. Think of some of the best books that you have ever read by \\"bestselling\\" authors that were in their prime.  I have, and can say without fear of contradiction, that this author has already placed himself as their equal.         The book is well written and thought out.  There are no quirky plot twists as one reviewer suggests. The character development, which is the lifeblood of any good book, was masterful.  The main character and his wife come alive as the story moves along.  Where they seem wooden and resigned in the beginning, they demonstrate vitality, and a sense of purpose as we get to know them better. No one has mentioned the moral layer in the story.  Both the main character and his wife undergo a worldview shift as the story unfolds.  It is the moral dimension which grabs the reader, and Mr. Smith is far superior to most writers in unfolding this methodically without overdoing it or getting ahead of himself.  In addition, the oppression he makes you feel as part of Russian authority at the time is alone worth the read.        Finally, I'm not going to give away anything specific about the ending, but if you're like me, I don't want to know anything about the ending, so if you don't, then don't read the next few lines.  It seems that unless there is a sad ending, then the elitists feel that the author is either a rookie, or too sentimental, or too romantic to be considered a great writer. This is the plight of our increasingly postmodern era.  Everything has to be nihilistic.  Mr. Smith, thank you for having the guts to let us, the readers, have our way- not the elitists.  I thought you tied up everything perfectly at the end.  You are already at the top of your game, Sir.
B0015KO52S|5.0|\\"If you play rock, you're retro.\\"<br /><br />I've been listening to this album pretty much non-stop for the past 2 weeks.<br /><br />It is easily the best album of 2008 (even though it's only May).<br /><br />Consolers of the Lonely sounds like it was recorded in 1974!<br /><br />Like equal parts White Stripes, The Band, Queen, Judas Priest, The Police, Fairport Convention, Jethro Tull, Phish, Derek and the Dominoes, Fleetwood Mac, Led Zeppelin, Cream, The Who, King Crimson, CSNY, etc.<br /><br />\\"Many Shades of Black\\" is a brilliant song. I would compare it to Queen and Cream (Queem?).<br /><br />This is album oriented rock at its finest.
1401307787|3.0|Perhaps it is because I have some familiarity with the eastern thought that I really didn't connect with much in this book. I didn't find anything new or novel.  Perhaps if you are completely new to meditation this could be an introduction but, then again, you will have to continue well past this book if you actually want to practice and benefit from meditation. In the spirit of the message of this book, I can say that this book didn't take me anywhere and therefore it succeeded brilliantly!

B000X5SPBI|5.0|This is the only show I will go out of my way to watch, my husband knows to not talk to me unless it's during a commercial when it's on.<br /><br />Supernatural gets better and better every episode with every season. Eric Kripke definitely knows how to keep the fans of the show coming back for more!<br /><br />I can't wait until this comes out on DVD and I can't wait until season four comes around!
B000TERG6S|5.0|I've never been too interested in classical guitar in the past.  I heard a song of his a few times on XM jazz and decided to check the rest on line.  I ownd two of his CD's now and they're both really good.  A great change of pace from rock and regular jazz.
B000ZN8036|2.0|*alert* Filled with spoiler potential *alert*<br /><br />Portions of Into the Wild were beautiful. The natural landscapes and odd characters were often compelling. However, the end of the movie was ruinous and unappealing. Into the Wild is not a story of hope, transcendence, or overcoming. It is, instead, a story of failure.<br /><br />I'm sure many viewers will be able to relate to the main character's need to explore himself and the world around him. Emile Hirsch plays Chris McCandless very well. However, I question the logic of glorifying a life filled with what I consider bad choices. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here. I will let you the viewer decide for yourself. Be aware before you decide to spend a few hours with this movie that there is no fairy tale ending.<br /><br />Nature can be cruel and Alaska is wild. McCandless saw, heard, felt and tasted things many of us will never experience. Is that admirable? Decide for yourself.
B00111YM5G|5.0|'Gabriel' was a movie that, on it's surface, didn't have a screaming potential.  I picked it up on a whim as a rental, expecting a fair movie.  I was actually surprised with the direction the movie took, forcing a very gritty feel of Purgatory, and grating it against the slow decline of morality and society as Demons swayed the balance of power.  In a solid attempt to force the more attentive viewers to weigh what they were watching, the director pushes Purgatory as a near-rendition of Earth itself.  I found myself thinking, \\"Is this really what Purgatory is supposed to feel like, or is this more the influence of the Demons pushing the realm towards their end of the spectrum?\\"  Followed closely by the thought that if Demons were guiding Purgatory into such a decline, is the statement then that Earth is the ultimate decline?    I may have read into this further than some, but I found it an enjoyable tangent to keep in perspective.  Further, the action is solid throughout, and the acting (for a lower budget flick) is fair to good.  The script doesn't leave a whole lot to the imagination, as the plot itself isn't full of too many twists.  I believe a lot of the \\"imagination\\" comes from the viewer, as they are guided through a turf war between Angels and Demons, intent to sway the balance of power in their own direction.    A movie like this is bound to capture the attention, and hold a place on the favorites' list, of many avid film watchers - especially those that enjoy good action splashed with some flavor and perspective.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Torchwood truly is an amazing DVD series. A spin-off of Doctor Who, it is for a slightly older crowd and if you don't believe me, check out Episode 2. It is a great show that deals with some of the same ideas and elements that Doctor Who does but from a human and people who've been dealing this before point of view. It's an interesting point of view seeing how they collide and how it all leads up to the season finale. Overall, I recommend you buy this season just for the pleasure of watching it.
B000LC55F2|2.0|This movie is unbelievably tedious, mostly because there is nothing likable about either of the magicians (histrionically portrayed by Hugh Jackfman and Christian Bale), who compete to present the best magic trick at the turn of century. Most pleasing are Scarlett Johansson's thunderously big thighs wiggling as she prances around on stage--she epitomizes \\"booty-licious.\\"
B00140PK6O|5.0|Watched three episodes of the Miniseries last year while visiting Ireland. Wonderful movie; cannot wait to see the last two episodes.
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|No one enjoyed Portishead more than me back in the day. I consider their work eclectic, yet musical. The use of scratching is not novel, but it somehow fit with their vibe. And while many thought the music was depressing, Portishead was a very accurate reflection of the times. For many years many of their fans hoped they might produce more work.<br /><br />\\"Third\\" is not that work. They should not have come back. It's just that simple. They do not have any new ideas; in fact, they seem more stripped down, more spare, more minimalist. I've got the perfect word: nonsensical. These are half baked musical ideas here; very little in terms of form, motif, chorus, anything. A warbling vocal is not enough. I'm hardpressed to call this an effort. I am sorry they came back. Portishead's return is like the Pixies return. Not very good the second time around.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|It took me being an idiot, and selling this CD some years ago, and then reclaiming it again just tonight in order to realize what a beautiful collection of music this really is. Seriously, this set shows off the amazing scope and depth that John Williams has, while it doesn't have every last one of his amazing compositions, it still shows what a fine composer Mr. Williams really is.     I will start off by stating that I started yearning for the set again after I saw a preview of E.T. being broadcast on TV and heard the sweeping \\"Flying Theme\\" playing in the background. The next thing you know, I'm off looking for this set, and bam! It's right in front of me, and I just decide to buy it. I then get home, and allow myself to relax and be blown away as the Star Wars theme begins to play.     From there, it's a journey through time, and memories as I recognize more than half the compositions on this 2-disc set. Stuff from Star Wars, E.T., Hook, Jaws, Indiana Jones, among many others permeate this beautiful experience. I still listened to the themes from the movies and whatnot that I did not recognize, and I still liked a good majority of what I listened to, the JFK theme in particular was powerful.     This is just a solid set of beautiful, orchestrated, and memorable music that is a journey through time, memories, and great movies. Honestly, what more could one ask for? For the price, this set does justice to the legacy of the man who is, in my books, one of the greatest modern classical composers of all time.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's literary masterpiece To Kill A Mockingbird portrays poverty during the Depression in an accurate yet somewhat negative light. The novel chronicles the childhood of Jem and Scout Finch, with their father Atticus, in the economically disadvantaged town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s. The decade brought increased financial hardships to much of America's muddle-class as racial tensions escalated in a nation struggling to achieve equality.  Although the majorirty of Maycomb residents faced a certain degree of poverty, Lee highlights extremely impoverished families such as the Ewells and Cunninghams. In a truthful rendition of the sacrifices many had to endure, Lee describes Walter Cunningham's lack of food. \\"He had no [lunch] today no would he have any tomorrow oe rhe next day,\\" Lee writes and, \\"He had probably never seen the quarters together...\\"  Mockingbird also displays the respect and generosity with which most tried to lead their lives, despire the poverty all around the,. When Scout invites young Walter over for lunch, Calpurnia, the Finches' housekeeper, reprimands Scout, admonishing, \\"Yo' folks might be better than the Cunninghams, but it don't count for mothin' the way you're disgracin' 'em...\\"  Lee's depiction of the dirt-poor Ewells, whose alcoholic father uses his meager income to fuel his addiction , allows the audience to glimpse the bottom crust of Southern society. Of Burris Ewell, a permanent first-grader, Lee writes, \\"His neck was dark gray, the back of his hands were rusty, and his fingernails were balck deep into the quick.\\" The poverty-stricken South is accurately exemplified in Harper Lee's classic tale To Kill A Mockingibrd.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|What happened to the Madonna I used to love?    I have been a huge Madonna fan for many years and I was very excited for her when she made the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  But lately I have no idea what she's thinking.    Oh well, it's pretty obvious why she teamed up with Justin Timberlake with this one.  She's simply selling out her long time fans, people who have supported her from the beginning, in an attempt to attract a new audience among the pre-pubescent, pre-teen types that would buy a bag of s**t if it had Justin Timberlake's name/logo on it.    The tracks on this album are simply awful and uninspiring and that's an understatement.  It's like she's not even trying anymore.  I haven't heard a single track that held my attention for more than a few seconds.  The American Life album was bad, Confessions was okay with some redeeming qualities, but this album is worst than anything I have heard in a long time.  I find it hard to believe that the woman who ruled the music industry in the 80's and 90's can't come up with a better attempt than this.     They say that the long term and repeated effects of Botox can cause mental instability.  Hmmm . . . in Madonna's case, there could be some truth to that.    Perhaps it is time for her to retire.
0761944524|4.0|This book contains very comprehensive explanations and descriptions with practical examples which are sometimes not so familiar with me (I'm a physician.). overall, this is an excellent book and I regret not being able to meet such a book in a way more focussing on medical fields. But this has a critical shortcoming in book-binding. you should not read this book so many times to keep the original shape. that's a reason why I gave 4 stars.
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek IV picks up where Star Trek III left off. The crew of the Enterprise(which was intentionally self destructed to trick the Klingons in Trek III)return (in one of the greatest if not the greatest Trek films ever created)to face the crimes for which they were accused of in Trek III. On their way to Earth to face the charges they are sent a message from Starfleet Command warning them to stay away because the transmissions from a probe are destroying the earth. When Kirk and crew learn about this and discover the transmissions themselves Spock picks up on the idea that the transmissions may be meant for a lifeform other than humans. Turns out hes right. The sounds from the probe are the songs of humpback whales. Only one problem: The last of the humpback whales existed back in the late 1980s. So Kirk and crew travel back in time in their beat up Klingon vessel to 1986 San Fransisco where they try to integrate themselves into their society and pick up two humpback whales named George and Gracie and return them to future earth hoping they can talk to this probe and send it on its way. So if youre a Trek fan this one is highly recommended by me but you dont have to be a Trek fan to enjoy this movie!!
B0013FNC38|5.0|I saw Jason a year and a half ago at Kutztown, and let me just say if you haven't seen him live, try to get to the smallest venue you can find and search this guy out.  Homeboy can sing opera like no other.  I dig his style and to be honest he is the best singer out there right now, plus he's got groove, and smoothness, and the gift of improv., which is what sets him apart live.  Truly amazing live!!!!!!  Must seeeeee!!!!!!!!.   So anyway, onto his best album he has ever created (no pun meant on any of his old stuff, but he has really come through on this effort).  His best song is \\"Details in the Fabric\\" just a real nasty track.  For some funk I liked \\"Butterfly\\".  Two love songs right in a row, for you romance killers out there in \\"I'm yours\\" and \\"Lucky\\" (These songs rule).  You can really tell he took some time making this album, which is what all artists should do.  Take their time and release good quality music.  If he comes back to anywhere around me I am still waiting because the last time I saw him it was the best concert of my life (UP there with the first time I saw radiohead).
B000093FLA|5.0|I can't say that Snatch is my favorite movie of alltime, but it's up there.  It has the most perfect cast imaginable, one of the best soundtracks, and a super slick directing style that makes you wish the movie would never end.  There's a lot going on in the movie, but it all comes down to everybody chasing a diamond.  To be honest I hardly ever thought abotu the diamond.  I was too busy laughing at all the great lines from all the great characters.  Bullet Tooth Tony has to be the coolest guy alive, Brad Pitt's character can't speak a word without getting me to laugh outloud, and the rest of the characters are all extremely entertaining.  Usually I would rate a movie as good if there are 1 or 2 characters I like, but Snatch has like 10.<br /><br />Rating- 5/5<br /><br />I have tried so many times to do a review for this movie, and I have failed once again, but this time I will let you read my rambling.
0743496736|4.0|I have read a few of Jodi's books and was really impressed.  I read Nineteen Minutes looking for a surprise ending...it wasn't a large surprise to me.  I knew how it was going to end.  But on a good note Jodi really uses alot of strong words to enforce everything happening.  I love how she used flashbacks and doesn't just stay as one persons view, it changes.  And well heres my summary:<br />Josie Cormier and many others walked into the doors of Sterling High on March 6th like it was any other day but that wasn't how the day ended up.  Peter Houghton never fit in, since the first day of school he was teased and bullied and he had had enough.  Detective Patrick D. always felt as if he never got any where in time to do anything.  Alex Cormier is a succesful judge trying to singley raise Josie.  Lacy, well she is trying to survive since Joey's death and make Peter stronger.  On March 6th all there lives change as a high school shooting occurs at Sterling High School, in nineteen minutes a person can do many things, one being killing ten people.
0743457900|5.0|The book was a fantastic read.  Le Carre did a masterful job of bringing in background information of all the characters and bringing them altogether for a fantastic finish.  The book keeps you guessing who was the perpetrator.  It's a must read.  Although it starts off a little slow and confusing but once all the pieces are in place, get ready for page turning excitement.
0312979479|5.0|very entertaining mystery, suspenseful and engaging - you are trying to figure it out all along, and then the ending just blows you away.  (Well it did me, anyhow.)  Lots of fun - great way to kill some time on a lazy day.  Don't read it when you're really busy though or you won't be able to put it down and you won't be able to get anything else done!
B000009QO6|5.0|I did not like Danzig at first. I just couldn't get into and past their image. Then this album got caught in my cd player. Wouldn't eject form my car stereo. So, everyday on my way to work I just kept the volume low and listened to it as background music. After a while, I started putting the volume up, little by little, as I would start to hear characteristics that I found to be interesting. At this point, I am just dissecting the music, scrutinizing it every which way possible to back up my rational for writing it off. Buy, you know, I couldn't do it. I kept finding the vocals to be a huge highlight. This guy is truly a talented singer that crosses genres. Quite unique.<br /><br />I didn't really care for the guitars at first, except for the solos. I found the riffs to be fairly basic and obvious. But, after awhile, I started noticing the very subtle qualities to the way they write the riffs. Very structured, and very much for the song, rather than for the sake of standing out. I started to see them in the way you might view a jazz quartet. Everybody playing for the music. Doing what is going to = \\"Danzig\\", and nothing else.<br /><br />Also, I noticed that half of the songs are actually very good, but that they're all listenable and solid. Very enjoyable.<br /><br />I really regret waiting on this and being closed minded.
B000QQFKYE|2.0|I've been blown away by Mulholland Drive.  It's fun when a director doesn't pander to an audience and lays the clues out for the individual to piece together.  But, in the aforementioned movie, there was a semblance of a plot, even if it's chopped up and moved around a bit.  This is nothing more than a rush of imagery with nothing coherent holding it together.  Lynch lets us into his head, but not his heart.  It's difficult to feel anything when he only shows us random images, strong colors and chaos, with nothing, in my mind, that glues them together.  In fact, for someone that loves to indict Hollywood, he sure seems obsessed with LaLa Land. And that's already been done and done better (see Mulholland Drive).  He's finally went too far down the rabbit hole!!!  Fun as hallucinatory dada, but not much else...
B000068GA4|5.0|The first album is a classic, but they really wrote better songs on this album. I love the first three Danzig albums more than anything, and this album is their crowning achievment.<br /><br />I recommend this album in its entirety.<br /><br />\\"Long Way Back From Hell\\" and \\"Snakes of Christ,\\" along with the rest, make this simply an awesome album.
0060899220|5.0|This book is a wonderfully entertaining story of how one particular chef came to be a Celebrity Chef.  What really keeps things moving, from start to finish, is Bourdain's writing style; simultaneously cynical, amusing and reflective.  He is not afraid to show the reader all the details, as he knows them.  He's led a hard life and has developed a truly unique philosophy based on his experiences.  Most importantly he learned from his experiences and wishes to pass his wisdom on to anyone interested in joining the crazy world of professional cooking.      Yes, things have changed in the restaurant industry since Bourdain wrote this book.  However the reader should take many of his recommendations seriously and should learn to recognize exactly what they are paying for when they eat at any restaurant.  And Bourdain's recommendations to the home cook are absolutely spot-on, invaluable advise to anyone who loves food.      Please, if you have any interest in becoming a cook or starting up your own restaurant, read this book.  Even if you don't agree with him, he brings up many good points about the highs and lows of the industry.
0380730405|4.0|I am a huge fan of contemporary romantic suspense and had very low expectations for this book I considered \\"dated.\\"  In many ways, the language, the pacing, the heavy description, it is dated and feels slow compared to what we are used to in the genre.  However, time doesn't diminish the power of the story, the sense of doom you feel for the unnamed narrator, the classic tension DuMaurier builds with every dark scene.  I'm glad I didn't rely on the movie to know the story of Rebecca. The book is a classic for good reason.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I was so happy to que up this movie, and I was happy to see right away a review to bring me back up to date from the long layoff.  The lentgh of the movie and no commercials just added to it's intensity, plus the quality of a dvd made this a must buy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been a Joss Whedon fan ever since Buffy the Vampire Slayer (I own that entire series on DVD, too).  When I first saw the TV ads for Firefly, I wasn't sure I would like it (I don't really like westerns).  But Joss Whedon's name was enough to get me to watch, and I was hooked!  Other than some scenes on horses, and a wild west feel to the frontier, I wouldn't really classify this as a western at all.          In Joss' shows, the dialogue is always excellent; okay, on Buffy sometimes it was corny.  But I have never seen a writer who could go from serious (well, as serious as a vampire show could be) to hilarious better than Joss.  Firefly is a believable concept (no aliens, just man expanding into the universe as he once expanded from continent to continent), well-executed, and lots of fun.  You care about these people, and you can believe that they care about each other (even Jane, somewhat, although he doesn't like to admit it).  The dialogue itself, and the timing of the delivery, is always right on target.  In comedy, they say timing is everything, and Joss has mastered that.         This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time, and of course I had to get \\"Serenity\\" when it came out, too.  Excellent wrap-up of the series, but why oh why did it have to wrap up at all?  Fox should have renewed this series!  Let's hope they learned from their mistake, and won't cancel The Sarah Connor Chronicles prematurely!        In summary, this is a GREAT TV show, and I love it!
0375842381|4.0|Of course, I have never read Harry Potter.  So basing my comparison with the first 3 movies of HP, I would say that this goes beyond the Harry Potter genre.  Almost everybody reads Harry Potter.  But  His Dark Materials is not for everyone.  To label this as a children's book is a grieve mistake for I am sure the little ones will miss the central message of the author.  But as for adventure, it is non-stop and most people from all ages will absolutely enjoy it.    After watching the movie, \\"The Golden Compass\\" my sister bought the set.  The movie had instilled an interest in me.  The bear fight scene \\"Bears! Who is your King?\\" cheesed me out, which made me realize how OLD I am.  So thinking that the book is targeted towards children, it took me a while to pick this up and  finally after 4 months, I continued on with Lyra's adventure.  But when I did, my whole week is automatically committed.  For five days, my sister saw me flipping book after book after book.      THE GOLDEN COMPASS:  I decided that I would start from the beginning.  It is a general agreement that the book is always better than the movie, no?  Except this time, I think the movie handled some of the scenes in the book much better.  The movie moved and switched some of the scenes around but it still worked.  Book fans bashed the movie because it left a big chunk of the book's ending.  I wouldn't worry about it though because if they included the real ending, then it'll be much more of an excruciating cliff hanger.  I don't think I could wait 3 more years to see next sequel. Still, several scenes has been skipped - important scenes and that's why in retrospect, the book is still better.  But to put the movie in a better light, when I imagine the daemons and dust and those flying machines, I could refer back to the movie.  Nicole Kidman is the perfect Mrs. Coultier! So in essence, the movie gives us a small peek of what goes on inside Philip Pullman's head.    THE AMBER SPYGLASS:  Since I've watched the movie, the first book was not as exciting as the second one.  The Amber Spyglass made me stay up the whole night. Lyra's new friend and another main character, Will, started off as an annoying character but proved to be as courageous, as smart, as likeable (if not more likeable) as Lyra.  Looking back, this book was so jam-packed and I felt like I flew through the pages so quickly.    THE SUBTLE KNIFE: Finally, I think the series' tandem faltered a tiny bit in this last installment of Pullman's epic adventure.  After building up so much intrigue and mystery, I was disappointed at the sloppy ending.  He  easily convinced me of the existence of the imaginary worlds he created but the most human and normal twist in the story fell out flat and forced.  For twelve year olds, okay...sure, it's possible...but why can't I believe it? Well, I'm not spoiling anything.    Albeit the weak ending, this series will definitely one of those books I'll keep recommending throughout my lifetime.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I really love this new portishead.  I am kind of glad that it took them more than 10 years to put out this album.  If it were to come out any earlier, I would probably hated it simply because its not trip hop. You know that sound: hip hop beats, lush/cinematic string arrangement, turntable scratches, old film score samples.  That was the sound that most people love but that sound have reached it peak in 1998. This is now, portishead have moved on and they offer something new that is really good. Its not a difficult album at all if you give it a listen. The album is melodic, beth still have a great voice and some songs I find a certain groove to them. The album is dark but its catchy. They are still an interesting band. Leave trip hop back in '98 and enjoy portishead now.
B000059GEH|4.0|Most often this film is advertised as a \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" movie, but honestly it is more Lauren Bacall.  Still a great film though.<br /><br />I enjoy watching it from time to time, but Bacall's obsession with wealth can be a bit much.  Betty Grable definitely has some of the best scenes, especially the one on the toll road!<br /><br />This movie is good fun.
B0013D8LOU|1.0|Again, Hollywood insists on blowing out our eardrums with overly loud, intrusive scores. Yes, I know this is a musical but one should be able to make out at least some of the lyrics over the music.  I really wanted to like this movie as I truly enjoy Depp's, Carter's, Rickman's and Burton's past works but... it was so boring!!! I couldn't stand to watch the whole thing... shut it off about halfway through. What an annoying waste of my time.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|I thought this film was just great.  I love Johnny Depp, and this movie is a wonderful display for his brooding artistic side.  I have never seen the musical, so I have nothing to compare it to ... that being said, I thought it was great all around.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen are good, but Jamie Campbell Bower and Ed Sanders are remarkable young talents.<br /><br />I recommend this film for a different movie-going experience and especially for fans of Tim Burton (of course!).
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|This album rocks!!! this is what REM should have released after Monster. Everything else they had released after Monster was a total disappointment, until now. From the first song to the last this will keep your foot tapping. The band seems to have found the fountain of youth. I'm glad they are back.
B00104W8T6|5.0|This was one of those great flicks where the music was in perfect sync with the feel of the movie. I watched it two times in a row and got all teary-eyed the second time as much as the first. Then........for the next several days I could not get those tunes out of my head so I bought the sound track. Good for all ages. Even my hubby liked it! KMc

B0013FNC38|5.0|From the first track to last Jason Mraz dazzles, perplexes and scintillates on his high-octane 3rd full-length studio album \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things.\\" His witty, highly individual lyrical style and organic, powerful backing band transform these songs into four minute detours into the mind of the most underrated singer/songwriter of the 2000s.<br /><br />Lead single \\"I'm Yours\\" finally lands on its feet after many years in Mraz's setlists with its mellow, Hawaiian grooves, complete with visions of obligatory surfers and pineapple drinks in the background. It's just a slice of what \\"We Sing...\\" has to offer, however. \\"Lucky\\" is a sparse, melodic duet with Colbie Callait that transitions aptly out of \\"I'm Yours,\\" while \\"Make It Mine\\" and \\"Live High\\" are classic Mraz with feel-good, enrapturing melodies designed to sweep listeners clean off their feet. \\"Make It Mine\\" is particularly upbeat, full of hand-claps and lush, horn-laden instrumentation. It should be a single, and if it becomes one it should give Mraz his first major hit since 2003's \\"The Remedy\\" if radio programmers have even a neuron left in their heads.<br /><br />The subject matter is diverse on \\"We Sing...\\" but Mraz never suffers from mood swings. \\"Love For a Child,\\" by far one of the most touching compositions of his career, touches on the effect of divorce on a young child (\\"When the house was left in shambles/Well, who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass?\\") while \\"Only Human\\" promotes environmental awareness without playing the blame game. \\"Details In the Fabric\\" featuring James Morrison is a moody, meditative look at life, love and relationships, while \\"Coyotes\\" takes Mraz's sonic pallete in new directions with layered vocals, percolating snyths and an awesome background chorus. His operatic vocals from \\"Mr. Curiosity\\" from his last LP make an appearance here.<br /><br />Other tracks continue the unparalleled quality. \\"Butterfly\\" is an awesomely-produced ode to sexual chemistry (\\"You make my slacks a little tight/You may unfasten them if you like/That's if you crash and spend the night\\") with effervescent instrumentation and a mercurial, vigorous melody. \\"If It Kills Me\\" finds Mraz pining through cheeky, self-deprecating lyrics about the lady who's got everything except the insight to see he's her best match (\\"We get along much better than you and your boyfriend\\") while \\"A Beautiful Mess\\" bookends the sentiments of \\"Details In the Fabric\\" with a more optimistic outlook.<br /><br />The album's arguable highlight, however, is the curiously-titled \\"The Dynamo of Volition.\\" Replete from wall-to-wall with Mraz's entrancing singing/rapping style, the song is like \\"O. Lover\\" or \\"Forecast\\" from 2005's \\"Mr. A-Z\\" is that it perfectly captures Mraz's unrivaled melodic weightiness. The lyrics spew left and right in haphazard fashion, but whether or not they are all understood makes no difference. \\"...Volition\\" is an exemplary Mraz tune, with a melody powerful enough to hang over the listener, the kind of melody that paints a picture like a scene from an indie movie, that haunts in such a way that it is instantly classic and unforgettable. It says more than any words ever could.<br /><br />Mraz has that rare kind of talent that puts him in the category of legendary musicians, those musicians with such blazing, inherent talent that it is simply cannot be learned or created. Elton John, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder come to mind as those types of dynamic musicians that were born with such astounding abilities, and Mraz has what it takes to join their ranks if only more listeners would wizen up and find out what some of us have been lucky to know for over five years.little tight/You may unfasten them if you like/That's if you crash and spend the night\\") with effervescent instrumentation and a mercurial, vigorous melody. \\"If It Kills Me\\" finds Mraz pining through cheeky, self-deprecating lyrics about the lady who's got everything except the insight to see he's her best match (\\"We get along much better than you and your boyfriend\\") while \\"A Beautiful Mess\\" bookends the sentiments of \\"Details In the Fabric\\" with a more optimistic outlook.

B000VDDWDS|1.0|even at a discounted price of 28 dollars - it feels like an enormous jip by Fox to assume blu-ray buyers would fork out that much for SO LITTLE - for the film... fine... but for so few supplements - that's highway robbery.  Shame on you Fox, shame!  'Predator' was mentioned, but 'Commando' was omitted as being another lame attempt by Fox, 'Master and Commander' continues the trend.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|First, I don't understand the barage of bad reviews because of the home video-like filming of the movie.  This was one of the most publicized aspects of this film!  This is not Godzilla or Alien vs. Predator or King Kong.  The movie was made to capture the plight of a group of people as they try to escape the wrath of a huge monster destrying Manhattan.    That being said, this movie was better than I expected.  And that's saying something, because I was amped to see this since the preview in front of Transformers.    I loved the home movie quality that started with a going away party for Rob.  A party that had the normal scenes of a guy (Hud) shyly chasing after a hot girl (Marlena) and the tension between a guy and a girl that are obviously in love but won't talk to each other (Rob and Beth).  Just as the Rob-Beth issue starts getting old, all hell breaks loose.  From that point on the film is incredibly intense.    Glimpses of the monster are seen right away as it dismantles the city.  We get a few closer looks of the creature as our heroes rush through the city.  And I have to say, this monster is awesome.  Nothing like Godzilla, King Kong, or anything ever seen destroying a city.  I recommend watching the extras afterwards to hear the writer, director, and FX folks talking about it.    Without going into plot, I will say that I loved the story-line.  Uncomplicated and straitfoward.  Clover (as the monster is referred to by the director) is on the loose and wreaking havoc.  Will our band of party goers make it out of the city?  Will the creature be defeated?  What the heck is the creature?  It doesn't matter.  This is one of the most original horror/thriller flicks in a long time.  Intense, scary, funny, gory, and intense (did I say that already).  I highly recommend this film...but remember, it's filmed camcorder-style.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|Is there a tripod shortage in this world?  Why is everbody and his brother making hand held movies that shake so much that it makes my dizzy?  Also, why do people go for these disjointed movies?  Does it make people feel smart that they can understand the story?  This movie reminded my of Babel.  Both movies sucked.
0525950079|5.0|When do you read a book or see a movie where the \\"sequel\\" manages to equal if not excel its original publication / movie?  Follett breaks the stereotype of falling short of his wonderful \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" with this marvellous tale of 14th Century England.  Its masterpiece of over 1000 page magnificence is full of adventure, love, betrayal, treachery, greed . .and some more.  I did not want it to end.  Hope Oprah discovers it sooner than she did \\"Pillars\\" and makes it the only second book from an author to be merited as her Book of the Month.  It is that deserving of the acclaim.
0345440757|5.0|This is the absolute best baby book around. I used the tips with all three of my children and it worked like a charm!  They all became great sleepers and eaters.  The best part is not having that overwhelmed feeling because you don't know what your bay wants or needs.  With this book I was better able to understand what their cries meant and therefore could meet their needs.  A must have for any new Mom!!

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Do not waste your money!!! This film totally sucked. Read all the other reviews and then read between the lines. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this movie. It might have made an interesting book, but was definitely not cinema worthy! I love a good horror movie and was highly disappointed. Blair Witch was actually better and it sucked too. I used to think BW was the worst to come out of Hollywood...but now its Cloverfield.

B0015RB72W|5.0|This just might be the album of the year!  A near-perfect, under-produced freshman effort from a new talent.  This is not as derivative as the media critics would have you believe:  why do they always have to call something new something old?  Call Duffy the flip-side of Amy W.  She's lighter, happier, better adjusted; even when singing about love lost.  She sings pop like a pro. My only gripes with the cd are procedural.  First, why can't the package designers put the track numbers on the back of the case with the song listings?  Did you ever try to figure out what number a song you wanted to hear was while you were driving?  Second and more important, this cd full of wonderfully-written songs has the worst liner booklet ever.  Twelve pages of mostly blank space and no lyrics for the fans to follow!  And the credits for the fabulous musicians have been reduced to two cramped inches.  Nuff said about the package.  Musically you can't beat Duffy's perfect pop excursion.  Buy it now and tell all your friends (both of them) to buy it too!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|With Phil Spector's wall of sound and the vocal whisper of Dusty Springfield (not to mention her image) Duffy makes a record that's the polar opposite of Amy Winehouse's brilliant Black to Back -- but with the same stunning results.    Duffy's album is more quiet. The strings and piano on most songs are just as important as Winehouse's growl on her record. Listen to the brilliant break up track \\"Warwick Avenue\\" and you'll swear that it's a lost LuLu track; it swells at just the right places as Duffy's voice crumbles like a Ritz cracker. And the dark \\"Rockferry\\" sounds like some alternate universe of a Petula Clark track. Like Winehouse, she's not just mining a sound, there does seem to be a genuine adoration for the sound she's going for.     If there is one complaint -- this record is short! It goes by fast. But like most great discs, you get a complete story here. It verges very close to a concept album. You walk away with an understanding of Duffy as an artist and that's very hard to get from one album. Her lilting sparrow like voice is seamless to the excellent production and this album is well worth the purchase.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|An EXQUISITE and deeply moving film and an absolute master class in black and white cinematography, all thanks to genius director Luc Besson and his right arm, cinematographer Thierry Arbogast. Toss in two delicately nuanced, courageous, sometimes funny and always heartbreaking performances by Jamel Debboule and Rie Rasmussen and you're left with something very, very distinctive.     The storyline of a statuesque, wise-cracking, slightly sluttish blonde angel with the longest legs and shortest dress on earth (or elsewhere) coming down to rescue a grimy, vaguely criminal street slug doesn't sound all that appealing I'll admit... worthy of a thousand cliches... but if one has ever felt lost as the world comes down on their shoulders, it works and it strikes deep. What a great script. What an intoxicating feast for the eyes and the soul.    Besson has an amazing gift for creating totally believable, riveting  emotional impact in implausible scenarios, as witnessed by the scene in his masterpiece Leon (The Professional) when the young girl says goodbye to her mentor while escaping down a trash shute. In Angel A, the final scene on the bridge and below is even more raw and naked and lump-in-the-throat, but I won't spoil it for the reader. I'll just say that if you've ever choked up at saying goodbye to someone this scene will get under your skin.    And what a lusciously beautiful film to look at, almost every frame able to stand on its own as a piece of art. If there was ever a film that deserved the black and white treatment and burst forth with a rainbow of emotions as a result, this is it.     Don't miss it.
0425223523|4.0|After watching the new PBS production of Persuasion, I was led to read the novel again.  After completing that, I still found myself wanting more...as I always do whenever I read one of Miss Austen's books.  I happened to look and found this book on Amazon.com at about 12:30AM, May 6th.  The book was releasing on May 6th, so I decided I must get it. I was able to purchase the book the next day from a local bookstore and was unable to put this book down.<br /><br />Ms. Grange does a fantastic job telling a beloved Austen story from the perspective of our Hero, rather than our Heroine.  While this book did contain an above average number of typos, and a few historical inaccuracies (compared to the original Novel), I found it delightful to read.<br /><br />In seeing Captain Wentworth's perspective (through Ms. Grange's eyes), I was able to put a new spin on this lost and found again relationship that I had never considered before.  I saw how my own prejudices always aligned with Anne's and was taught to see afresh, how things might look from someone else's eyes.<br /><br />If you are an Austen fan, or just a fan of period romance novels, I highly recommend this book.
B000XT2LMS|5.0|i've had this watch since january 2008, it's taken a beating as i am a mechanic and this is my everyday watch and its still holding up really really well. love the vintage feel of it. i happened to recieve the 7s26b movement which is a little slow, about a minute or two a week but i dont mind. i usually adjust it every two weeks.    the canvas strap is starting to fade and i love how its starting to look like an original military watch.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|what a long, long, long and boring movie!!! i thought it would never end. i didn't want to turn it off as it was so boring i knew i would never put it on again and i wanted to see if anything worth seing actually happened. it didn't. there's 2 1/2 hours of my life i will never get back.
B00026WU64|5.0|What more can be said about Dylan's Freewheelin'? He was only 21 but he already knew what life was going to be like. He sounds as if he's his own reincarnation - he'd been there and back! Wise words pour from his mind and come to us as this life riddle imagery. May the wind keep on blowin'...
B00005YXZH|5.0|I must admit that when I first heard YHF back in '02 or '03, I thought it was interesting but not quite on par with Being There or SummerTeeth.  I actually felt disappointed by it in a way that now seems inexplicable to me, especially since it has become my favorite Wilco CD over time.  Sometimes first impressions aren't the best, and, sorry Ginsberg, first impulses aren't always right.<br /><br />In pulling together the songs that would ultimately boil down to make YHF, Tweedy and company left a lot of castaways behind, including several band members and the 6 song \\"More Like The Moon\\" EP which can now be downloaded for free from their web site in 192kbs MP3 form with artwork.  Working with new collaborators Jim O'Rourke and Glenn Kotche (Tweedy's Loose Fur pals), the band began honing the sonic experiments and melodic songwriting to their purest, often disquieting form.  A wealthy of unreleased material exists from these sessions, and songs like \\"Cars Can't Escape,\\" \\"Venus Stop The Train,\\" and \\"Let Me Come Home\\" would have fit in nicely with YHF's overall vibe.  Hopefully those songs and others from these sessions will get official releases in the future.<br /><br />From here on out, YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT will be regarded as a beautiful, haunting classic, and one that seems to deal with issues of communication, or the lack thereof.  Now it's hard not to hear this album as a looming soundtrack for the post-911 world.  This is essential listening!
0756404746|5.0|I received this book as a christmas gift from my mother-in-law.  I read a lot of books, and did not manage to pick this one up until earlier this week.  I haven't been able to to put it down.  I didn't know whether to be happy or cry when discovering there will be another book, but it is AGES AWAY!<br /><br />I'll just say, as one fantasy novel fan to all the others:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I thought George R.R. Martin had ruined me for all other writers. :)
B0010YSD7M|5.0|As a huge fan of the SG-1 series I was pretty upset over the cancellation of the show, especially with the new bad guys in town: the Ori. Suffice to say, this movie was a great wrap-up to end an amazing series. The only thing that would have been better was if the series was never cancelled and there could've have been an extra season or two of episodes to tidy things up.<br /><br />The one drawback I found with the movie was how the movie seemed compressed in an effort to finish the Ori story in a clean manner. While the movie did a great job of tying up loose ends, it felt rushed compared to 10 seasons of episodes. It's just a shame that Richard Dean Anderson didn't at least make a cameo appearance (at least he'll be playing a big role in Stargate: Continuum[[ASIN:B0017MO10U Stargate: Continuum]])<br /><br />Regardless of the relatively minor drawbacks (which are unavoidable when attempting to close out a series as great as Stargate SG-1)this is a must have for anyone who followed the series)
0316067598|5.0|This book shines the light of truth on how our LIBERAL: MEDIA, POLITICIANS (DEMOCRAT and REPUBLICAN), RETIRED MILITARY, PROFESSORS, TEACHERS and CITIZENS, directly have a hand in killing the finest young men and women our country produces.  The evidence is irrefutable, LIBERAL'S KILL American heroes when they influence military rules of engagement, and we as real Americans should elect strong leaders to prevent their perversions.  This book should be required reading for all teenage Americans, as it clearly introduces American exceptionalism and a hero creation process.  Hero training is a first half of the book prelude to Operation Redwing, straight forward and inspiring, but only hinting at the action to come.  When the actual mission begins hold on to your seats, because \\"LONE SURVIVOR\\" reads like a viewing of the 'Bourne Identity', and will force you to replace your list of favorite Super Hero names, like Superman and Hulk, with the names of real life heroes like Murphy, Axelson, Dietz, Kristensen and Luttrell.  This work of nonfiction will enrage you and clarify why LIBERALS SHOULD BE DESPISED and fought at every opportunity, but you will also smile, laugh, tear up and be forever haunted by the fact these great men are real and their families loss is ours as Americans.  Lastly, read \\"LONE SURVIVOR\\", pass it on, and let us all pray LIBERAL'S will see through their ignorance and stop COLLABORATING WITH THE ENEMY TO KILL future heroic Americans.
B0017U7PT6|1.0|WOW, this is a stupid, pointless, bad, cgi fest.  Horrible acting, DUMB DUMB script.  This makes Bad Boys 2 look like Casablanca.  All the suckers who paid to see this on opening weekend should have been given tshirts that said \\"CGI SHEEP\\" on them. Make a trailer with a cool effect and fill the seats as the people go \\"OHH SHINY\\".   I watched this off a copy a friend of mine \\"acquired\\" and I actually felt ripped off of time wasted.  To quote the people of South Park \\"RableRableRable\\"
B000000OYN|4.0|Musically speaking this cd is fairly good.  My only complain is that the sound output is very low.  In my car stereo the volume level of 7 is reasonably loud, but not to pearcing loud.  Whenever I play songs from the \\"Gold\\" and \\"Good To Be Bad\\" cds that's the level i use.  I made a mix from those two cds and from \\"Saints & Sinners\\"  and whenever a song from \\"Saints\\" came on I had to turn the volume up to 9 so that it will be on the same level as the other songs. It just annoys me when there is a huge disparity in the level of sound output whenever I make a mix. I like all the songs to be at a equal sound level so I won't have to keep messing with the volume control.  Anyways it is just my hang up.
B000088SX6|5.0|If you were to be transported back to 1950s Cuba, you might find music like this coming from the hottest night clubs. The big difference, of course, is that electric instruments were not nearly as prevalent in those days. What is presented here is some of the wonderful Latin rhythms and melodies reminiscent of pre-Castro Cuba, using Fender guitars and a hot, young percussion section. The feel of the album is that of an intimate night club, and you are a guest at the table, witnessing the best musicians in Havana playing dinner and dance tunes in a live setting. Beautiful music and two of the best-sounding Telecasters. You can almost smell the cigars!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is a wonderful book for the reader of any age. It is a quick read that can be finished within about a week (or even two days for some) that follows a great storyline about pursing your dreams. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a classic, light read.
1878424505|5.0|I was compelled to pick up this book a few years ago at a bookstore without knowing anything about it at all, and I rarely purchase books.  I didn't know why then but after I read it I knew why.  No book has inspired me or taught me like this one. I have referred back to it many times over the years.  This, along, with \\"The Mastery of Love\\" by the same author have been such a positive changing force in my life that I am forever grateful for stumbling on them.
0679746323|4.0|If half of the stuff in this book is true, then this is a story of an absolute thug! The book at certain points is revolting and it becomes difficult to read as atrocities are narrated. The CCP should take a page out of their masters, the old Soviet Union's CP after Stalin, and \\"purge\\" themselves (yet one more time) of all of Mao's legacy.   The Chinese must be very resilient indeed to have come this far in this post-Mao era.

B000002GMT|4.0|Here are the hits that didn't fit on ABBA Gold,  a few interesting ABBA album tracks, some B-sides,and one never before released track -I Am the City (recorded in 1982). This is the closest thing there is to a stand alone ABBA rarities/B-sides album.      This CD has often been out of print in various territories . The original version of this CD had liner notes by UK ABBA press officer John Tobler, but the recent remastered editions has liner notes by Carl Magnus Palm.    This album was originally going to be more of a rarities/fan request project,that would feature even more B-sides and unreleased tracks such as \\"Just Like That'. But instead it was decided to go with a track lineup with more familiar tracks. So sadly, only one unreleased track was included.      The previously unreleased 1982 track here, \\"I am the City\\", is not surprisingly,a perfectly good song featuring Agnetha and Frida on vocals, some worthwhile lyrics and great synthesizer work.  This CD has four of ABBA's six hard to find 1982 recordings on it. The three other 1982 tracks available here are \\"Cassandra\\",\\"Under Attack\\" and \\"The Day Before You Came\\".     This CD was released again in 2008 with updated liner notes.
B0007PLLQ0|3.0|There is some hot debate over this dvd.  When I purchased it, I thought I was getting the european version of Legend (the best) with the American version on the other side, effectively the same two-disc edition that I fell in love with at my local North American video.  But buyer beware!  This version of legend (the one that isn't the ultiimate edition) is only the final directors cut, and it is probably my least favorite.  There are 4 versions of this movie out there: the american, the european, the tv special edition, and the directors cut. the european is the best because it has a lot of the footage the american version doesn't without the awful soundtrack or stupid ending of the directors cut which ruined the movie for me. grab yourself a copy of the ultimate edition and look on ebay.uk for the european, my personal fav!

0061537934|5.0|I have finally found a new novel I can stand to read.<br /><br />To my great astonishment, it's told by a dog. (I'm not a pet-lover).<br /><br />It contains many insights about car racing. (I have no interest in car racing, and I look askance at sports analogies.)<br /><br />And the author has described it as \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull' for dogs.\\" (That book is tied with 'The Giving Tree' as my Least Favorite Ever.)<br /><br />So what do I find to praise?<br /><br />The concept: \\"When a dog is finished living his lifetimes as a dog, his next incarnation will be as a man.\\" Not all dogs. Only those who are ready. Enzo, a shepherd-poodle-terrier mix, is ready.<br /><br />Enzo has spent years watching daytime TV, mostly documentaries and the Weather Channel (It's \\"not about weather, it is about the world\\"). And because Denny Swift, his owner, is a mechanic who's training to race cars, he and Enzo watch countless hours of race footage. So Enzo knows about the world beyond the Swift home near Seattle.<br /><br />The situation is equally appealing: Enzo is old, facing death. While he has learned from racing movies to forget the past and live in the moment, this is his time to remember. And he can remember objectively --- as a dog, his senses are sharper, his emotions less complicated. With the clarity of a Buddha, Enzo can see. And he can listen: \\"I never interrupt, I never deflect the conversation with a comment of my own.\\" So he's quite the knowing narrator.<br /><br />And then the story: a happy family, brimming with good feeling and ambitious dreams. Denny loves Enzo like a son. Denny loves his wife Eve, who works for a big retail company that \\"provided us with money and health insurance.\\" And Denny lives for Zoe, their daughter. Then Enzo smells something bad happening in Eve --- the dog is always the first to know --- and you start to brace yourself. But not enough, not nearly enough. Bad things happen to good people in this novel, and then worse things, and soon you are so angry, so hurt, so tear-stained and concerned that you do not think for one second to step back and say, hey, wait, this is just a story!

B0013FNC38|5.0|I have just been playing my new album and I am kinda hooked! I bought it mostly for the track 'I'm Yours' which I've seen on the internet a hundred times. However the more I listen the more I love the whole thing. Stand out songs are 'Lucky' featuring Cobie Caillet, 'Make It Mine' (surely the next single?!), the heartbreaking 'Details In The Fabric' a duet with James Morrison and my new favourites 'If It Kills Me' and 'Love For A Child'. This isn't an edgy album, its an unpretentious set of simply crafted, feel good, grown up pop songs that you find yourself singing or humming long after the disc has stopped spinning.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've only been doing this workout for about a week & I can already feel a difference! I've done a lot of workout videos & I could barely get through the 20 minute segment the 1st couple of times I tried it. I'm feeling stronger everyday... I've only done Level 1 so far, so I'm sure the 2nd & 3rd levels will be even better. Looking forward to it!
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|With accelerate REM brings back the same energy into their music as \\"Automatic for people\\" and \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\". However, Stipe no longer has the weird hairstyle and no longer wears a white sports jacket into a concert.    I have grown up with REM's music, their sound keeping me company - ever evolving, adventurous and experimental. So I loved \\"Automatic for people\\" when I first heard it and \\"Up\\" - on the other side of the scale as far as energy is concerned - which I absolutely loved more than anything else they have produced.    It seems that REM has come full circle; the evolution in their music is complete and its time to go back to the tried and tested sound which made them famous in the first place. \\"I lap it up, I lap it up anyway\\" but I wish there was more left.

B000P12LWY|5.0|Yes, there are inaccuracies, as others have pointed out here.  This is a dramatization and this is elegant popular entertainment.  As an armchair historian, in love with the stories of Henry VIII, I find it absolutely gripping.  The acting is for the most part marvelous, and the idea of doing these great personages as compellingly attractive people is a brilliant one.  I think there is plenty enough here to draw a person into good books about Henry and the English Reformation.  One thing I do like very much is that Anne Boleyn is being presented as the complex woman she obviously was; and Catherine of Aragon has been presented with immense dignity and respect.  But the reason I've signed on here to recommend this series is that I really think it will encourage serious study on the part of many as to what really went on when Henry broke with the Catholic Church, and when popular entertainment invites us to study, to learn more, as well as giving us delight, well, that is worth something. The portrait of Thomas More is excellent, and the actor playing Anne Boleyn's father is quite remarkable.  Finally, let me confess: there is something delicious about this series, something thrilling.  I find myself charmed by it. Of course I wish the Catholic Church was presented with considerablly more understanding on the part of the writers.  But in spite of that I continue to watch the second season, as enthralled as I was by the first.  And I've ordered a whole slew of new books on Henry just because of this series, so I'm proof myself of what I'm suggesting here: this will encourage the serious study of history.  --- The art direction and the costumes are gorgeous.  The lighting is breathtaking. --- The sets are glorious.  I hope Showtime gives us more of this top notch entertainment.
1604244674|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite books of all time.  This is  breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.<br /><br />From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes.  Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished.  Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!<br /><br />Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!<br /><br />Check out this book!  It's a once in a lifetime experience!
B000RZGFZC|5.0|This album kicks so much a$$ one of the best in metal history from one of the big 4.  A true metal classic that cannot and will not ever be matched.
B0009A40ES|5.0|If you are amused by psychotic behavior like myself,  You must buy this movie.  Very entertaining.  I absolutely loved it.
B0013FNC38|5.0|If you like Jason Mraz, this album is a must-have.  I got the extended track version, which costs a bit more, but has 26 tracks, including various live versions.  After listen through, I can tell that this will be my favorite album of the summer!
B000WQW988|5.0|I knew this would be good but didn't realize that they would be doing cover songs which I thought was nice. I assumed they would just be doing accoustic versions of their songs. Kurt Cobain was too cute for words, you could see that he was a little nervous but what a great show. Well worth the money to own a piece of history.
0060935464|5.0|The great American classic, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, is a heart-warming and insightful re-telling of one spunky, curious girl growing up in the racially-divided and old-fashioned South. The main character, Scout, was constantly reprimanded by her relatives, for being too \\"unladylike.\\" She breaks through these gender stereotypes by refusing to adhere to this expected persona of a Southern Belle. Ever her brother and friend engage in sexist jokes and banter, and exclude her from certain activities because of her gender. Despite her dealing with the constant insults to her person, Scout blossoms into an upstanding and determined woman, partially because of her father Atticus's moral teachings throughout her development.                This book is considered a classic for a reason. Not only does it contain beautiful writing and meaningful morals, but it also has an entertaining plot. The book appeals to twelve-year olds and forty year olds alike, with a sweet and humorous story. All different kinds of people, from the more \\"involved\\" Stephanie Crawford's to the sassy and opinionated Calpurnias, can enjoy this wonderful tale of growing up, learning new things, and breaking boundaries that has entertained a nation for over forty years.     by ava, jenny w, lizzy, and rosalie.
B00104QSOM|5.0|This movie was well done from start to finish.  Daniel Day-Lewis did an amazing job.  The evolution of Day-Lewis' character, and the relationship with his son, is really interesting.  I can't really pin point the exact reason why I like the movie other than all the little experiences Day-Lewis' character goes through, and how it all sums up at the end with his rival.  If you have a short attention span (i.e. if you like Michael Bay movies, or anything of that nature), this movie is not for you.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is one of the most promising series to come around since \\"Six Feet Under\\" (also starring Michael C. Hall). This first season is loosely based on the first of Lindsay's \\"Dexter\\" novels, but makes enough changes that even those who read the book will be surprised. What makes this show great? Well-written characters given spot-on portrayals by perfectly cast actors. All the characters from the novel are brought to brilliant life, and many of the novel's more one-dimensional characters (particularly the Maria LaGuerta character, and Dexter's girlfriend), are given extra dimensions here. The standouts are Hall as Dexter, who was so good as the very different David on \\"Six Feet Under\\" it was hard to imagine him even being convincing in this much darker role, let alone making it his own, but that's exactly what he did. Jennifer Carpenter brings a touching vulnerability to step-sister Debra, yet also makes her brave and capable, unlike the book's incompetent caricature.
B0000035E7|5.0|If you like Nevermind you should like this also, I personally think Bleach rocks much harder. If Dave Grohl would have been the drummer back then it would have been even more awesome. All and all it's a great CD.
B000VDDWE2|5.0|I never saw this movie on DVD.  That being said, I cannot imagine the DVD experience being worth the money.  This movie was meant to be viewed in high definition. Absolutely beautiful!
0452289963|5.0|this book will change your outlook on life!  you've got to read it to believe it.  it is a bit slow, but you will realize it is just your old self fighting you as you embark on a great change.
0143038419|1.0|I have to completely agree with others who felt this author was so self-absorbed that it was difficult to read this book.  It was an \\"I feel sorry for me\\" book from the first page.  It became difficult to continue reading about how easily she made friends and how she cried constantly, isn't that kind of incongruous?  It dragged me down trying to finish the book.
0810994739|5.0|My kids (boy 8, girl 11) were THRILLED when I surprised them with these books.  I actually had three days of silence - in the car, at home, you name it!  They read one book, traded and read the other.  Too bad there wasn't more in this series.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it.  In high definition on BD it is even more enjoyable, with the amazing views and cinematography.  I would definitely recommend to anyone with a BD player!
B000002I53|5.0|John Coltrane-My Favorite Things *****<br /><br />This is not an album I would recommend to newer fans of Coltrane's. First A Love Supreme, then Giant Steps, then Blue Train, then, maybe My Favorite Things. For the simple fact that this can be overwhelming at times.<br /><br />'My Favorite Things' the title track which opens the album is one of Coltrane most inspired recordings ever. The reworking of the show tune is done wonderfully. His Soprano Sax solos are to die for, and in fact it is Coltrane's reading of this track that inspired Robbie Kreiger of The Doors to write their biggest hit, 'Light My Fire.' Needless to say this became a standard. 'Everytime We Say Goodbye' is equally breathtaking, though less known. 'Summertime' is a classic and one that people either love or hate. For me personally, Janice Joplen, and Miles Davis did it best, Coltrane did a good job with it but it really, really, really, can over stay it's welcome with its length. 'But Not For Me' is a standard played better than ever by Trane, and is the perfect way to close the album.<br /><br />As I have become quite the Coltrane fan I have realised you can some his work into two categories, craftsmanship/composing and his raw talent. This falls under the latter. His raw talent helps transform this rather dull tunes into something stellar! So five stars...? Without a doubt.
B000VL9XE2|5.0|Dillinger Escape Plan put out another great effort with this album, as of this review their most recent.  There are traces of the previous album Miss Machine, but they also seemed to have gone back more to their older album that essentially defined a new genre: Calculating Infinity.  If you enjoyed these other albums or any of DEP's other albums, you should enjoy this latest effort.  Overall a great outing that may be the DEP's final album on a CD.
0810993139|5.0|Great book.  Kept my kids quiet for three days.  They read one, traded and read the other.  Get both books, your kids will thank you for it!  :)
0446509256|5.0|If you like Arkady Renko, you will like \\"Child 44.\\"  Because I like the Arkady Renko stories so much, I was skeptical when I started this book.  Who would be bold, and foolish, enough to attempt to clone Martin Cruz Smith?  The similarities are there, of course, but I am willing to overlook them.  I'm 200 pages into \\"Child 44,\\" and the plot has \\"grabbed\\" me.  The characters are \\"sinister,\\" and the plot developments are \\"chilling.\\"  For sure.
0785126708|3.0|I love Pak as a writer.  He's great.  However, compared to Planet Hulk, this story just didn't work for me.  Yeah, the Hulk wanted revenge for being shot into space by Stark, Richards, Strange, and Blackbolt, and yeah I'd probably be pretty mad if my wife was disintegrated as well, but compared to Planet Hulk, this story was pretty lame.  It was cool that the Hulk's Warbound allies were included, and the betrayal revelation was amazing and totally unpredictable, but I think the art was the main reason that this didn't hook me.  John Romita Jr. is not one of my favorite artists out there, no matter how many awards and accolades he gets.  In fact, I think the only things that he has done that really worked for me are his Eternals run with Neil Gaiman and his work on the new series Kick-A@#.  I am sorry that Marvel, with the abundance of talented artists that they have out there, had to choose JR JR to do this book.  They should have kept the same artist from Planet Hulk if you ask me.  Anyway, asides from the art, the story wasn't that bad, but it's nothing to write home about.  Peace and Love, Jake  (This is reviewing the paperback version, which is available by the way).
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|I'm not going to use a bunch of pretty words to compel you to accept my review as \\"gospel\\" because I'm smart or something.  I'm gonna just make this simple and plain.      I bought into Portishead when the Trip-Hop movement was in full swing... back when it was pretty much Portishead and Massive Attack on top of the  WORLD.    If this album would have been released instead of Dummy, back in 1994, they would have vanished.  But instead they released something dark and mysterious... something miserable, strange and hip.  The samples, the cuts & scratches, the theremin, the breaks.  It used to be music for the A.D.D. inflicted.  Now, it's so boring I can't pay attention for more than 20 seconds for it to grow on me.  I've moved on to more stimulating sounds now like Architecture In Helsinki and Vampire Weekend now.    Trip-hop died such a quick and painless death, kids don't even recognize it as a genre anymore.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a relief after the numerous tedious pieces of \\"classic literature\\" forced upon us by our county's curriculum. This book interlaces themes related to both adulthood and childhood which parallel the stage of our lives which we currently live.    To Kill A Mockingbird centers around the lives of Scout and Jem Finch and their explorations of the facets of maturity. The two spend there summers with Dill, exploring their sleepy southern town and trying to coax Boo Radley out of his house. The siblings grow apart as the each begin their own transition from child to adult. Jem's changes manifest themselves in his habitual \\"maddening superiority\\", while Scout learns more about the intricacies of the more adult world. Their new found maturity is tested when Atticus takes on the job of defending Tom Robinson. Then they learn the true meaning of growing lies in making the right decision when faced with the wrong.    This novel resonates with teenage readers in a way uncommon to many of the books imposed upon us in school. Everyone should read this timeless classic because it is more that just a classic. It is a catalog of life lessons imparted to the reader through a collection of memories.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Excellent acting,direction and screenplay.  In the Sci-Fi genre, haven't seen anything like this since Rod Serling died.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|*minor spoilers*    I haven't bought the video yet, but I saw it once in theatres and now have it on Netflix - and I've been watching it about every two days for the past two weeks.  (Actually this last couple times it's been good background noise...)  But I rated the film five stars because it is everything you get for the idea Abrams wanted to put on the screen.    The first thing I want to review, however - more address - is the complaint of the shaky camera.  You've got a handheld camera being held by an amateur.  OF COURSE things are going to be shaky.  People who have complained about this I feel two things for.  One: get over it.  It's supposed to be that way, it's supposed to be gritty and real and even annoying, just like a basic home movie would be.  Two: if it DOES cause you to be sick, I'm sorry.  Perhaps you weren't warned about it when you walked into the theatre.  But that's the fault of the theatre, not the fault of the movie.  So stop blaming the director and the camera operator for it.      I thought the camera work was quite well.  You could even tell the differences based on who was holding the camera.  Rob had a fairly steady hand during the flashback scenes, (though it was shaky near the end - but he WAS being BOMBED), Hud's camerawork improved throughout the film. Jason had a shaky hand, period, because he was trying to learn how to work the thing.  For the complaints about how shaky things were - he was walking, running, ducking, and of course there was this huge MONSTER walking around whose footsteps likely caused at least some minute shaking.  We're supposed to see the film through the camera lens, not Hud's eyes, (an argumentative point given how often he zoomed into Marlena during Lily's testimonial).    The camera should not be blamed for 'making this film bad'.    I was mildly annoyed at the usage of 'monster movie moments'.  Of course, it IS a monster movie, so it is going to follow some of the same tracks.  I do wish the annoying little buggers hadn't shown up when they did though.  The moment the night vision was on, they were visible.  It would have been a little scarier if they had shown up sometime AFTER the vision was on so the audience was over their initial \\"He's going to turn it on and the monsters will be there\\", and was just beginning to relax.  Then all of a sudden SURPRISE!    What I am most worried about is that they are planning a sequel (or prequel, not sure which).  This movie caught audience attention from its first trailer running, (which I believe was in front of Transformers?), and sheer curiosity factor made for a huge opening night.  (I say brilliant marketing).  But half of the world seemed to like it and half hated it.  A sequel will diminish the power of the film.
0780622553|4.0|When it comes down to it, a large part of who we are comes from our collective experiences, from our past, from our memories. But what if our memories weren't our own? What if all of our experiences were generic? What if our pasts had been manufactured? Would it then be possible to manipulate us through our memories? Luckily, no one has that power... or do they?    John Murdoch awakens to find himself naked and vulnerable. He has no memory of his past or of his own identity. The only thing he knows is that he's lost in a mystery, a mystery that only deepens when he finds a dead woman's body in the hotel room where he is staying. He quickly dresses himself and checks out (wouldn't you?). But things only become more complicated when eerie people begin to pursue him, accusing him of the murder. Soon he comes face to face with a startling realization: every night, at midnight, the world stops and time is frozen. During this nether hour people's memories are altered, the city literally reconfigures itself and alien beings known as \\"Strangers\\" control everything. But John Murdoch has powers too. Will he master them before he is destroyed? Will he use them to liberate the dark city or to enslave it further?    Director Alex Proyas ([[ASIN:B000059XUO The Crow]]) creates a gothic, expressionist metropolis in this mind-bending thriller. He utilizes his strong sense of visual direction but also creates an intriguing tale of identity. The issues touched upon are timely. What makes an individual? Do people control their own fates or are we slaves to a higher power? Can mankind redeem itself? Is time just an illusion? What makes Dark City so unique is that it raises serious questions but, for the most part, leaves the answers to the viewers. It's interesting to note that this film came out about a year before [[ASIN:B00000K19E The Matrix]] popularized thought-provoking sci-fi films.  Some critics have complained that the acting is stiff (which it's meant to be), while others panned the film for simply being too bizarre (which is why I love it). Regardless, it's obviously a misunderstood film. As for the acting, the performances recall old noir films from the 1940s. Rufus Sewell, William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly would all be right at home in an old-fashioned detective movie. Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, seems to be a combination of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with Victor Frankenstein. As for the Strangers, they seem to be an offshoot of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers' drones. The acting is appropriately awkward as none of the characters are fully realized. They are drones programmed and reprogrammed every night, never allowed to evolve or develop. The screenplay was written by Alex Proyas, David S. Goyer ([[ASIN:0780624890 Blade]] & [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins]]) and Lem Dobbs (Kafka).    The original DVD release features both Widescreen & Full Screen versions of the film, two audio commentaries, numerous essays and reviews, etc. Also included is a hilariously BAD game, Find Shell Beach, which features some of the worst video graphics I've ever seen. But overall if you dig freaky fantasy films, dreary detective tales or surreal sci-fi then Dark City should appeal to you.    Just after writing this review, I became aware of an upcoming [[ASIN:B0018O4YT0 Dark City (Director's Cut)]] edition that will be available July 29 2008. This means that there will be two different versions available in the retail market. Although I have reviewed this version of the film, I also suggest giving the new edition a try.

0321344758|5.0|I'll bet that every person who builds a web site, personal or commercial, big or small, thinks that, even if it has a few faults, it's pretty good.  I'm not certain that people who visit sites have as charitable a view.  Steve Krug believes that the visitors' views could be improved with a common sense approach to web usability.<br /><br />The theme is set out in the title.  Web users don't want to have to think.  In order to incorporate that fact into web sites, Krug sets out some simple concepts for web designers to follow.  I hesitate to list these rules because they are so simple that if you read a summary here, and pay attention to them, you almost don't need to buy this book.  But Krug's skill is in convincing you that you should take his advice, and suggesting how to implement it.  His guidance is simple, including: design pages for scanning, not reading; make sure the user knows where he is on the site through navigation design; and test sites with real users.<br /><br />The author suggests that the book is so short it can be read on a longish airplane ride.  But the points he makes are so important that everyone responsible for a web site, whether designer or CEO needs to be reminded of them.  I know that I consider myself pretty savvy when it comes to usability, but I came up with several tips for quickly improving my web site as I read the book.  (I also saw a few weaknesses in my site that the author identified that weren't so easy to correct quickly, but I'm working on those problems.)  Moreover, while I didn't laugh out loud, I found the book so good natured that it was easy to become absorbed.<br /><br />The book has little of a technical nature about browsers or web authoring software, but instead deals with a few broad principles of web usability.  That's enough reason to recommend that everyone with a web site of any kind should read this book, especially since it is so easy to go through.  I can't guarantee you will find something of use, but I'd love to get your URL if you don't.you don't.
B00006LLLN|5.0|\\"Wow\\" is the best way to describe the experience of listening to this 2 CD set. I can't imagine a better helping of bluegrass and alt country than what I hear on these sides. The instrumentals are blistering, Alison's vocals are breathtaking, and the all around musicianship is nothing but outstanding. There may be purists who know of better versions of the standards in this repertoire, but I'll take these any day.
B00005Y6YB|1.0|This much cut down and butchered version of the Hallmark adaption of  Larry McMurty's great book left most of the meat on the cutting room floor.    Put up on two DVDs it is much shorter that the full six hour version.    In my opinion the book was great for all the detail it provided on the life and times of those living in the West in those days, and I especially appreciated the way the background of the characters and events were presented to flesh out the story. The Hallmark TV series on which these two DVDs are based was true to the book and IMO that is part of the reason it was so mesmerizing.    But in this version almost all the background has been omitted so you don't understand that Gus and Call were once famous Texas Rangers who cleared that part of Texas of the Indians, you are not shown the details of Gus and Clara's youthful relationship so when they finally meet you wonder why. No mention of the young Irish boys fear of snakes, which amplifies his being killed by snakes, almost all the data on July Johnson's search for the killer of his town's Mayor and his deputy Roscoe's adventures with his small, silent rock throwing partner is no where to be seen.    But the omission that I simply cannot forgive is total omission of Blue Ducks taking of the Lori and Gus rescuing her at the cost of Roscoe and the two children's lives. Not only is the action missing you are left wondering why the Lori is suddenly being taken care of by Gus and why she has become so withdrawn. You have been cheated out of the heart of the story.    Plus points of course are the great acting by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones.    I could go on but the best advice I can offer is to give this synopsis like version a miss and find somewhere the original uncut version of this glorious tale of the West.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Sony has finally brought back the vibration to the controller.  To play without one looses that extra dimention to the games.

0452286751|4.0|The Fountainhead is a philosophical journey into the life of Howard Roark, a young man struggling as an architect in a society that can not accept his innovative style.  Set in 1940's New York City, Roark toils in the shadow of a prolific and publicly-favoured rival Peter Keating, and must work despite the crushing power of the influential columnist Ellsworth Toohey.  Roark's modern and efficient style of architecture appeals to a very select crowd of people, but his stubborn self-interest prevents him from bending to the wills of society.  Thus his work is shunned, ostracized, and he is repeatedly put out of work either by lack of clients or by lawsuits against his almost offensive creations.                Under the surface of this straight forward plot lies vital insight to Ayn Rand's philosophical views of society, producing the book's main themes: the importance of self-interest and the strength that individualism possesses over the universally appealing virtue of altruism (collectivism); and the inherent evils contained in a collectivist (almost communist) society, and their consequences to the individual.                   The long and tedious beginning and middle sections of the novel are overwhelmed by the value held within the closing chapters.  Rand takes ample time to intricately develop each character through tiresome descriptions, but this is necessary to understand the events, interactions, and the mindset of different characters at the book's climax; which delivers her philosophical message in one final, exciting knock-out blow.  This novel is very thought-provoking, and is a great read for the politically, ideologically, or philosophically-minded person.  Be forewarned that this book is not an adventure novel by any stretch of the imagination, but is a must-read for every member of the intelligentsia.  I truly enjoyed this novel, as it was an excellent source to develop one's own philosophical ideals, depending on which stance is taken against Rand's blatant presentation of \\"Objectivism\\" (Rand's philosophical adaptation of individualism and capitalism).
B000JVSUS4|1.0|This ranks among the 5 worst movies I've ever seen. Visually appealing, yes. But the story, the acting, the flow of the movie - just terrible. It was so bad, my wife and I actually contemplated not watching the 2nd disc - even though that's the half that has the attack, which I knew would be cool to watch; and yet - I had no desire to waste more time watching this film. The joke now is that if someone tells us they liked this movie, we know that we cannot rely on any opinion they might give on another movie.  Yes, it's that bad.
0307387178|5.0|This was my first book by Krakauer. We were assigned to read it in highschool as a sort of \\"american dream\\" type novel. I heard a lot of bad press about it. I was not expecting to fall completley in love with this book. Many people say that Chris was dumb and should not have done what he had done but for people like myself who have always had that \\"live in the wild\\" call inside them for years this book is wonderful. He has done everything I have wished I could do (other than the dying part). The movie also does justice to the book, very well actually.     Its a wonerful story- very touching and heartfelt. I have read it around 8 or 9 times.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|The greatest movie ever made!!!!!!!    If you havent seen it; you need to.    if you have and you didnt like it, well that means you werent paying attention, because it doesn't get better than this.    I tell ya everyone needs blu-ray you will not want to watch a movie without it.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Paul Greengrass who got a Best Director Oscar nomination for \\"United 93\\" in 2006 helmed this project.  The hand-held camera in the action sequences magnified the sense of unease and chaos.  Matt Damon was nominated for Best Actor back in 1997 for \\"Good Will Hunting,\\" when he came away with the Best Original Screenplay Oscar.  As Jason Bourne, he's tightly wound.  His characterizations vary slightly from what we've seen in films like [[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed (Widescreen Edition)]] & \\"The Good Shepherd.\\"  Julia Stiles again plays Nicky Parsons with a tight-lipped poker face.  She does an excellent job as the sympathetic spy on the run.  David Starthairn who got an Oscar nomination for \\"Good Night & Good Luck\\" plays Noah Vosen, the ruthless CIA director who will break the law in order to protect it.  Scott Glenn who did a nice job opposite Hillary Swank in \\"Freedom Writers\\" plays Ezra Kramer, the big boss who is playing both sides.  Five-time Oscar nominee Albert Finney (\\"Tom Jones,\\" \\"Murder on the Orient Express,\\" \\"The Dresser,\\" \\"Under the Volcano,\\" & \\"Erin Brockovich\\") plays Dr. Albert Hirsch who recruited Bourne into the spy program and remade him into an assassin.  Joan Allen plays Pamela Landy, the agent who does not have an ulterior motive.  Allen smoked the screen for me in [[ASIN:B00005JNP4 The Upside of Anger]] which also earned her Best Actress awards from both the Chicago and San Diego Film Critics Associations.  She shows a complex character on a continual political balance wheel within her agency.  Joey Ansah does a great job as the assassin Desh who flies around Morocco on a motorcycle.  The Film won Oscars for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Sound Editing (Per Hallbert & Karen Baker Landers), & Best Sound Mixing (Kirk A. Francis, Scott Millaw & David Parker).  \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" is an excellent film that picked me up at first frame and deposited me breathlessly at the closing credits.  Bravo!

B00005CDNK|4.0|I first heard \\"The Visitors\\" 25 years ago cruising around w/friends in college, and I remember my friend Diane warning us that this Abba tape would trip us out...the intro \\"sounds like Rush\\", I remember her saying.  And for a guy who preferred hard rock and metal, I was intrigued.  The melodies and the lyrics made you realize this wasn't the overproduced numbers that ABBA was famous for pop audiences in the US; it was mature in lyrics and its styling.  Years later I bought the CD, and I can say it's one of my favorites when I'm in the mood for something somber and reflective - check it out if you don't have it.
B0017U7PT6|1.0|I can't believe anyone who actually saw this movie would give it more than 1 star.  The acting and 'plot' were nonexistent, the 'special effects' were almost cartoon-ish and to top it off you only saw a pack of woolly mammoths, 1 sabre-tooth tiger, and big pyramid thingy.. AND THE WOOLLY MAMMOTHS AGAIN! OMG... it was about as 'BLOCKBUSTER' as a Sci-fi channel made for tv movie.

0060935464|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, details the story of a young girl living in Maycomb, Alabama. this girl must learn to cope with the issues of racism and classism within her community. The novel accurately depicts the strong overtone of racism in the south. Little Scout, brimming with maturity beyond her young years, is faced with racial adversity when her father takes a case defending an African American.  Wee Scout is harassed by peers who call her strong, caring father a \\"nigger lover\\". Scout, being a rambunctious and feisty youngster, is forced to change her aggressive lifestyle due to constant teasing from her fellow classmates. She courageously perservered and sticks by her father's side throughout the trial.  This book, one of the first of its kind, shows the readers the true corruption of the time. Scout must come to terms with the fact that the society surrounding her is blinded by prejudice and stereotypes. Although her and her family know the innocence of Tom Robinson, Jem must face Scout with the unfortunate reality that \\"here are things [she] doesn't understand\\" about southern society.  the detailed accuracy of the racism and injustice within the court system at that time is astounding.
0757307272|5.0|I am not a teen. I am not even in my twenties but this book has already taught me one of the most valuable lessons: to take 100% responsibility for my life and realize that I have more to do with the outcomes in my life than I wish to admit. So far, whenever things didn't go the way I imagined, I always found the reasons why .... I.e. it wasn't the right time, my parents weren't rich enough, my school wasn't prestigious enough and then my colleagues weren't dedicated enough, I wasn't lucky enough, I didn't have the right connections, etc. While all of that may have been true, I finally realized that no one really cared for my explanations. I was spending all this time on justifying my \\"so-called\\" failures, vs. focusing on taking responsibility and making changes in myself and my life.<br /><br />So why was it this book- \\"Success Principles for TEENS\\" - that opened my eyes? Normally I wouldn't have sought out a \\"teen book\\" but I happened upon this one through a friend who has ordered Kent Healy's other book \\"Cool Stuff They Should Teach in School\\" for her students.<br /><br />I must admit, typically I'm simply too annoyed and occasionally intimidated by self help books but this one was different. It was genuine and real. And it was definitely not \\"preachy\\" if you know what I mean. Reading it felt like talking to a good friend, someone who understands your potential but doesn't let you get away with excuses.<br /><br />I only wish I had this book sooner. Who knows what my life would be like now?!<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is striving for a better life. Not sure how much discount Amazon gives today, but $15 dollars is NOTHING compared to what you'll get out of this book. I felt like I owed it to myself to get my own copy and now I am going to order some for my friends too - especially those in their teens and twenties - just to give them a head start :-)
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Granted, this CD isn't an extension of \\"Confessions\\", it still has Madonna's style to it.  Although \\"Confessions\\" was a reintroduction to the times of her more youthful self, this album definately speaks to the control and enlightenment Madonna has gained over the years.  Many people have bashed the album stating that it is her worst in years, but there are many tracks that are one surprise after another, and I think that in time people will grow to appreciate the album for what it is.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Hi, Can somebody please tell me if First Season has something in Spanish?? (could be either subs or audio)    Thanks
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|You can't expect another 'Confessions' by Madonna. She's never done the same sound twice. This time she went for the sure thing and, boy, she delivers. An army of four: Madonna, Timbaland, Justin and Pharrell spawns this hyperpop thing that is impossible to escape. The problem for most people is that it grabs too much of Furtado and Stefani, but actually those two girls borrow a lot from Madonna's pop approach in the early eighties. Stefani's been called the 'watered down Madonna'. So the queen of pop can't go wrong on her own field.<br />Hard Candy lacks the hypnotic aura from her previous 'Confessions' and 'Music', and instead falls into pure hip-hopvselectro ground. This CD is totally danceable and dumb. There are some more mature tracks like Devil Wouldn't Recognize You and Voices, but the drive is mainly the dance floor and the sing along crowd.<br />Yeah, it is like Gwen and Furtado on steroids. Madonna did it better. And that's a fact.<br />Stand out tracks: 'Heartbeat', 'Incredible', 'Give it 2 Me', 'Candy Shop' and 'Beat Goes On'. Purely infectious aggro rythms. Awesome way to end a legacy at Warner.

1401300529|5.0|_The Coldest Winter_ is brilliantly written, insightful, passionately argued, vivid, moving,and illuminating. It combines incisive and penetrating character portraits with gritty field-of-battle reportage.    You might or might not like it.     _The Coldest Winter_ sets out to do a particular thing, and does it superbly. That thing may not be what you're looking for, though.    There are a good many things _The Coldest Winter_ is not. Most importantly, it's not a blow-by-blow straight military history of the Korean War. There's absolutely no attempt to give even, neutral treatment to all the battles. The successful Inchon invasion gets a few pages; the horrific Unsan ambush gets a full chapter.    It also is not a neutral piece of descriptive bio-history. Halberstam has a point to make--maybe even an axe to grind. He's unsparing in his judgements, whether he's describing the vicious brutality of Stalin and Mao or the wooden-headed obtuseness of some U.S. commanders.    What it is, is a story. This is history as narrative, complete with moral. Halberstam has a tragic villain (Douglas MacArthur), a villain's henchman (General Ned Almond, MacArthur's protege), and a sinister cabal of political intriguers (the American \\"China Lobby\\"). He has, too, a hero (General Matthew Ridgeway) and a hero's sidekick (Colonel Paul Freeman). He opens with a narrative hook (the Unsan debacle) and closes with a dramatic climax (the downfall of MacArthur). The battles he chooses to describe are those that are required to move his plot along.    This is not to say that _The Coldest Winter_ is one-dimensional or simplistic. Halberstam gives MacArthur, for instance, full marks for military brilliance and dedication, even while he documents MacArthur's egomania. Truman and Acheson take their share of hits. All of his portraits are thoroughly researched and well-documented. It's all compelling, and it's pretty damn persuasive.    Still, for all its brilliance, this book is an *argument* in favor of a particular set of positions and ideas. Halberstam, as he did in _The Best and the Brightest_, is giving an explanation for why a bunch of really smart people ended up supporting policies that ultimately failed. It's a superb piece of analysis. It convinced me. Whether it will convince anyone who comes to the table with different notions is open to question.    (Aside: The applicability of this question to current politics is obvious. In one case, Halberstam gives in to the temptation to make the connection explicitly. As usual, I think his case would be stronger if he hadn't done so.)    So if you're looking for unadorned battle history, this is not the book for you. If you're looking at a balanced, non-judgemental political history, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for a complete, exhaustive general history, this is not the book for you. And if you're a passionate admirer of Douglas MacArthur, this is *definitely* not the book for you.    Still, _The Coldest Winter_ does do one thing that all readers should applaud: it pays the soldiers of \\"the forgotten war\\" the tribute they deserve. However murky the politics of Korea, young men suffered and died there. Give Halberstam full marks for remembering them--no matter what else you may believe.
B00005O5CM|4.0|In my 4 decades of movie watching, I don't know if I've ever seen one with a more predictable plot than this one.  The writers made no effort to mislead the viewer, unlike movies such as Charade with Audrey Hepburn or Sixth Sense.  None the less, Legally Blonde was quite enjoyable thanks to Reese Witherspoon's spirited acting, some good gag lines, Reese's amazing pink wardrobe, her Chihuahua's amazing and often coordinating wardrobe, and clever supporting characters.  Unfortunately, the supporting characters like the angry lesbian law student and Raquel Welsh as a pampered wealthy socialite only had a few lines and were pretty much background for Reese Witherspoon, but they did add some interest and amusement.  Reese Witherspoon's acting carries this movie and brings it from a mediocre 3 stars to a respectable 4.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Having only read Anne Rice's fantastic novel after watching the movie, I had none of the expectations for this film that plagued the moviegoers who'd already fallen in love with the character of Louis, the vampire constantly at war with his own emotions.  I first saw this film at a younger age, sometime around 13 years old.  It had a profound impact on me then, as I had never had much chance to watch even PG-13 movies per my parents' authoritative rule over the content which reached me.  However, I was able, at times, to find ways in which to view films beyond their reach.  Many of these films I had to get from my older brother without his knowledge; films he adored and was able to purchase without my parents' intervention at 16 years of age.  Interview With The Vampire was one such film, and being such, it had already given itself to me as something special, considering its procurement as something of a long, drawn-out chore.  After viewing it several times over the course of a year, I had committed it to the topmost place in my list of favorite movies.    From the opening credits, I was enthralled.  Every milestone in Louis' life, every mistake he makes, every pang of guilt he feels captivated my interest.  It was at this point in my life that I'd decided Brad Pitt was my favorite actor (since supplanted years later by Johnny Depp), as he conveyed some of the most complex emotions I'd yet seen on film.  The dark undertones of Lestat and Louis' tenuous friendship sent chills through my spine.  Claudia's predicament, eternally trapped in the body of a six-year-old, beautifully portrayed by Kirstin Dunst, was as believable as anything I'd ever known, enhanced to a large degree by Elliot Goldenthal's mesmerizing score.  The film sparked my thoughts about the depths of human emotion, and what it truly feels like to be alone.  I believe it was quite influential in my development as a young teenager, and I am glad that what I took away from it was its philosophical ponderings, rather than the neo-gothic stylings some of my contemporaries decided to mold themselves to.    All in all, I recommend this movie very highly.  See it, enjoy it; if not for its action or drama, then for its music and philosophical value.  Anyone should be able to find something of value in Neil Jordan's cinematic masterpiece.
0783222149|4.0|The opening scenes of THE RIVER WILD show a very buff Meryl Streep rowing in Boston's Charles River accompanied by stirring theme music by Jerry Goldsmith.  This promise of quality is fulfilled throughout the suspenseful albeit rather predictable movie after the setting switches to the western wilderness.  Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon are among Hollywood's most talented and versatile actors and in this outing Streep believably plays a mom who meets extreme physical and emotional challenges (while piloting a white river raft no less)  after she encounters Bacon a cunning criminal psychopath.  The river scenes are beautiful and I've read that Streep actually did her own stunts for the most part. There are a couple of surprises along the way to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.  A good movie for anyone but especially a family with older kids who want a little bit but not too much edge to their viewing experience.
B000VUDSH6|2.0|After regaining some of the ground he lost in Hollywood with his last couple of Hong Kong films, Jackie Chan takes a big step backwards with the overlong Rob-B-Hood, a downmarket three bad men and a baby romp that offers limp gay jokes, comic relief mental illness, family bonding and child endangerment for all the family. There is one fairly good action sequence at the halfway point as well as a neat stunt that sees him jumping down a building via the air conditioning units, but you definitely get the feeling that Chan's no longer pushing himself but is just doing what he knows he can still do while Yuen Biao is mostly wasted in a nothing bit part. He's made worse, but that's hardly a recommendation.     Dragon Dynasty's 2-disc set offers the theatrical version with audio commentary. There's also a variety of interviews and featurettes, but the film is such heavy going you quite possibly won't want to spend any longer on it once you've seen it.
B0016IV2G6|4.0|With his fifth solo album \\"Past In Different Ways\\", Michael Kiske revisits the songs written by him during his Helloween years (1987-1993). Tracks from Keeper Of The Seven Keys I&II, Pink Bubbles Go Ape and Chameleon are re-arranged acoustically. Even though Kiske's vocals are the main attraction of this release, several tracks manage to sound quite powerful and interesting, in spite the fact they are performed in an acoustic manner.   Kiske has received constant criticism concerning his departure from Helloween, his detachment from metal music and his negative comments about the genre. With this album (which was an idea put forth by Frontiers Records) Michael tries to show that \\"...I don't reject my past just because I'm a different person today, and on the other hand it can maybe give people who were part of that past a different view at those songs\\".   Past In Different Ways is arranged in a way that showcases Kiske's incredible vocals. The songs have not been completely changed as the main riffs and melodies are still there. Some passages and solos have been altered, several songs are performed in a different key but most tracks are easily recognizable. Besides the acoustic guitars, which dominate the instrumental portion of the album; violins, trombones, trumpets, piano and accordion are used to enrich the sound of some of the songs.   There are several notable songs to be found here, but the best of the bunch are probably the trio of opening tracks: \\"You Always Walk Alone\\", \\"We Got The Right\\" and \\"I Believe\\". All three tracks have strong melodies, tempo changes, well executed acoustic leads and solos, while they also provide a powerful and epic atmosphere. Other songs worth mentioning are the wonderfully altered \\"Kids Of The Century\\", the up-beat \\"When The Sinner\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"Your Turn\\".   Kiske's voice truly shines on this recording. He has lost very little of the vocal power he possessed during the Helloween days and his voice sounds more mature, emotional and controlled. His singing changes from lower and middle range melodies to crystal clear high pitched belts, complemented by unwavering vibrato. On most tracks Kiske sounds better or exactly the same as he did 20 years ago. Goosebumps guaranteed....   The only downside of this release is the simple arrangement of some songs. 'A Little Time' sounds groovy but too plain, 'Going Home' has lost its main melody, while 'Longing' hasn't changed that much. On the other hand, this is a record with the main focus on the vocals and not the complexity of the songs, so I might be nit-picking here.   The Japanese edition of the album includes a brilliant cover of \\"How The Web Was Woven\\" (Elvis), where Kiske's vocal abilities surpass all expectations.  This album will be definitely bashed by many and appreciated by few. People who only enjoy heavier sounds and despise acoustic rock will definitely hate this. Most hard core Helloween fans will consider this album a heresy, while power metal fans will flame Kiske for not singing metal. In my opinion every artist is free to do whatever he pleases with his music and Michael is free to sing acoustic rock, aor, pop or whatever else satisfies him. People waiting for his return to metal can listen to his guest appearances on the new Avantasia release The Scarecrow and on the forthcoming Revolution Renaissance - New Era album.   \\"Past In Different Ways\\" is definitely worth attention. It is a perfectly produced album, complemented by an amazing acoustic atmosphere. Any fan of good vocals, acoustic arrangements, nice melodies and Kiske's songwriting will love this album.   (Note to Helloween fans: Give this album a chance, these are just different versions of the old songs and Kiske still has that amazing voice)
0452289963|5.0|My experience of Tolle's 'A New Earth' was highlighted by having read it along w/ the half a million other across the world for Oprah's 1st online class. The book truely has a universal message that crosses all borders including race, religion, age, sex, etc. 'A New Earth' provides guidance, courage, & support to every individual whether they are just beginning the soul search or continue to embark on the journey. Too, as myself a recovering alcoholic w/ a disabled mother addicted to prescription drugs, I found (especially in the online lectures & discussions) encouragement & numerous 'ah ha!' moments. Please go get this book & pass it along to your family members & friends!
0743298039|5.0|I am an avid reader.  I was not prepared to love this book but from the first chapter I was hooked.  I did not put it down until I was done. The plot and characters were brilliant.  I can't wait for the next book from this author.
B0015RB72W|5.0|Duffy is the latest Blue eyed soul singer from the UK, following in the wake of Amy Winehouse. With her kohled eyes and bouffant blonde hairdo, images of Dusty Springfield come to mind, and indeed, it doesn't stop at just her image. She has got the voice to match; light, yet soulful.<br /><br />Lead-off single (and UK #1 hit) \\"Mercy\\" is a bouncy retro sounding Motownish organ inflected song that Ms Springfield could have done.<br /><br />The rest of the album is filled with lush, catchy ballads all touching on different aspects of love/relationships; \\"Serious\\" (sweeping strings and lovely harmonies), the sparse cinematic \\"Stepping stone\\" (my favourite), the Blues-tinged acoustic \\"Syrup and honey\\", the sweeping, soulful \\"Hanging on too long\\", \\"Scared\\", the brilliant Phil Spector-ish \\"Distant dreamer\\" (which just seems to keep building up - another favourite of mine), \\"Rockferry\\", and \\"Warwick avenue\\".<br /><br />Great things were already touted of her (much like Adele) last year before she's even released her album and she's already living up to the hype. Her album hit #1 in the UK seems to have set up house in the top 10. Here's hoping she can cross over the pond and crack the US also.
0385334206|5.0|This is Vonnegut's famous \\"50th birthday present to himself\\", and if you ask me, he spoiled himself with it. Out of the few Vonnegut books I've read, this is the funniest, and probably the best. Basically, Kurt here dismisses the entire American nation as racist, materialist, and obsessed with sex, class, alcohol, conformity, and whatever else you could trot out. It would be considered a pessimistic, nihilistic viewpoint if it wasn't a sadly accurate look at the way America worked, and still works today. And for a little note to those who think the book is racist, keep in mind that the black characters are actually portrayed as being, in a way, a lot more intelligent and less misanthropic than the white ones.<br />This isn't an easy book to describe. There's a plot, but Kurt veers away from it on several occasions, offering a wide variety of satiric tangents that make for some of the most hilarious parts of his writing. There are illustrations, crude, simple, and absolutely hilarious. Kurt even sticks himself in the book, makes himself a character, and has discussions with other characters. Choice segments include the scene at the Holiday Inn cocktail lounge, where Kurt has a discussion with himself; every discussion of Kilgore Trout's misadventures with getting his books published by his sleazy publishing house; the uproarious prologue; every illustration; every tangent; and... well, pretty much everything. It's not a book for everyone, but if you're looking for a whole ton of laughs in one place, and some of the best satire known to mankind... whoa. This is it.<br />Oh yeah, the book's about what happens when car dealer Wayne Hoover decides everyone on Earth but him is a robot. But, as I said before, the plot is secondary here.
B000MZHW1S|4.0|There are quite of lot of people out there who are not sold on Leonardo Dicaprio's acting abilites--I am not one of them.  He delivers a strong performance in this topical drama and deserved an nomination for Best Actor as well. The picture and sound in HD DVD is superb and I whole-heartedly recommend you buy this one to show off your system!! Dijmon Hounsou is also superb in this and I believe he was also nominated.  The only flaw I can see in this is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly--she has no chemistry with DiCaprio and the film could have been better without her character. Not to put down her acting ability (remember she did win for \\"A Beautiful Mind\\") but her character just wasn't really needed in this fine film at all!!  Ed Zwick's direction is on target and he captures the plight of the Africains as they are being exploited by the mercenaries and Europeans for profit.  A visual and aural feast for all you HD DVD enthusiasts!!
B0006J28KU|1.0|Somebody, maybe Pauline Kael, talked about the pornography of violence.  In that sense, Michael Mann makes pornographic films: very hard guys, very lovely women, very little dialog, and lots of automatic weapons fire and spattering blood sacks for the jaded audience.  No actual humans need be portrayed, no actual interaction is therefore required; just pretty people banging away.  Only Mann's films, pretending to be something other than what they are (not sure what, though), go on forever.  At least porn's unpretentious and quick.  Honest.  Give it a try.  Rent something XXX and compare it with \\"Heat.\\"  You'll see.
B00151G08Y|3.0|The first listen through left me with a \\"what the f?\\", reaction.  But I've since listened to this album a few times and I have to say, each time I do it grows on me a bit more.      I was surprised to find much more vocals in this than in their previous release.  Another new addition seems to be the use of guitar.  Which, in my opinion totally ruins some of the tracks  Overall it has much more of a mainstream/pop feel to it.  The electronica elements are still there, but I would classify them more as \\"electronica rock\\", or \\"dance pop\\"    There are a few very weak tracks (like \\"9000 miles\\"), but they are offset by some undeniably good ones (like \\"Visions\\" and \\"Midnight Runner\\").      To be perfectly honest, this is probably an album that I'll listen to casually for a few weeks, then forget about entirely.  NOT a classic by any stretch of the imagination.
1594489505|3.0|Miriam is raised with the idea that she not worthy of life's finer things.  Her mother makes it clear that being the child of a wealthy man and a servant has made her undesirable and unwanted.  Miriam grows up thinking that her mother is right.  When her father turns her away and gives her to a much older man for marriage, Miriam goes without having a choice.  She moves with her new husband to an city unknown to her in Afganistan where she has trouble conceiving a child.  After seven miscarriages and failed attempts, her husband has nothing but contempt for her and treats her like a slave, abusing her every step of the way.    Laila is the daugher of a local family who's sons have gone off to fight in the Country's war.  Her father is kind and brilliant and dotes on her every chance he can get.  Her mother, however, is unable to cope with the absence of her sons and becomes completely unglued once she is notified that they have been killed at war.  Laila's biggest ally is Tariq - her childhood friend for whom she is developing romantic feelings.    Amidst tradedy and violence, the lives of these two women become intertwined.  What starts out as a hostile and hateful relationship soon develops into one of love and companionship as both battle the same evil man.  The two grow in their love for each other, Laila's children, and their common fight against oppression.    The writing is exceptional in this novel and really brings to light the suffering of the people, and particularly the women, in Afganistan over the past half century.  The book never stalls and you want to keep reading to see how it turns out.  It is somewhat predictable, however, and the reader will not be shocked at the outcome.  Any other result would be too depressing in an age where we want the good guy to come out on top.  While interesting set amidst the backdrop of Afganistan, the story of the interpersonal relationships between the women and their abuser is not new or original.  This is where the novel becomes simply average.
B0006IIPJ4|4.0|A pretty good high adventure flick.  Not too complicated a plot, and of course, you have to suspend disbelief with some of it, but the action moves right along, and the acting is pretty well done.  It has shades of \\"Romancing the Stone\\" or any of the Indiana Jones movies.  Some of the scenery is quite impressive, and I particularly like the Art Deco feel they put to the whole production. I'd watch it again.
B00005V9IJ|3.0|Cast Awat starring Tom Hanks is a good and sad film but it runs 45 minutes too long. The beginning and middle are the best and satisfying parts, the last hour is a bit of a letdown and the ending is left open so the viewer can ponder what road this man has decided to embark on. Hanks is the best thing in this film, his acting is remarkable, only he could pull off this quiet but intense performance. Helen Hunt is miscast and so is Chris Noth. Cast Away is worth a viewing, so check it sometime.
1416914293|4.0|Yes the writing is atrocious at times (\\"the metal melted like ice cream on a hot day\\" - ugg!) and maybe I wasn't expecting much after City of Bones, but I actually liked the story and thought it was pretty entertaining with plenty of action. I've never watched Buffy, so I can't attest to any similarities - perhaps if I had I'd be more in agreement with the negative reviews here - but overall I enjoyed the story and it kept me engaged enough to keep reading. I thought it flowed better than COB and had better overall pacing.<br /><br />As for characterization, I still found Clary somewhat lacking but I liked Jace much more this time around. He wasn't as cocky and showed more vulnerability which made him a more likeable character. A number of other reviewers seemed disturbed by the Jace/Clary situation and while it's not my favorite plot twist, it's also probably not what it seems.<br /><br />From what I can tell, Clare has garnered quite a few enemies due to the fanfic issue and as a result anyone who rates her books well gets a deluge of unhelpful votes, which is unfortunate. While these books aren't great literature, they're quick, easy reads that would likely appeal to a younger teen audience.
B0013XS8A2|4.0|Like others before me, this album reminds me of a movie score.  It is sweeping, grand, intimate, majestic, and overall just plain good.  The 'overture' Harbinger hits on all of these qualities, while Animus is at once plaintive and contemplative and then tremendously grandiose.  It reminds me of the writing of Basil Poledouris.  Silhouette brings out the closest thing to a lead guitar, while still retaining the classical tone, and could be the love song of the album.  Shabda follows up with a choral section that sounds straight out of Karl Jenkins' Adiemus.  The Tempest blends much of what we've heard together so far.  On My Heart sounds like it belongs in the middle of an Enya album.  Aurora is an uptempo that reminds me of something that would sound good in a desert epic film.  Prophecy has a sinister majesty all its own.  Harmonia Mundi sounds like it escaped from James Horner's Braveheart score.  The Other Side is an exotic, brooding desert piece that could be right at home in Maurice Jarre's Lawrence of Arabia.  Empyrean blasts the trumpet fanfare one more time, and Musica Universalis hearkens back to the end of part one from Tubular Bells to close the album out.    So why the one star deduction?  Because it all follows the Tubular Bells formula, and it has the ghosts from that album appearing constantly throughout, making it almost a Tubular Bells 4.  One has to wonder if Mike can't get his first album out of his head.  Certainly he has done spectacular work that didn't follow that formula, and it makes me wish he had resisted this time.  After all, we have Tubular Bells 1, 2, 3, 2003, and Orchestral.  That seems enough.
0061020710|2.0|I am a fan of the fantasy genre, and also a fan of dry, witty humor, and from what I gathered from my better-read friends, the Discworld series is an exemplary cross between the two.  I therefore dove into this book with very high expectations, which is probably a shame, because it frankly failed to live up to them.<br /><br />It's not that the book failed to be funny; I laughed aloud many times as I read it.  It's not that it failed to be witty; on the contrary, I often felt that an intended witticism might have been so subtly crafted as to slip right by me, unnoticed.<br /><br />What the book failed to do, in my opinion, was to tell a story.  Sure, there is a series of events that take place, but for all intents and purposes, no one event really leads into another in any significant way.  It feels something like flipping through several television channels, all of which are playing different episodes of the same bizarre comedy.  The tragic offshoot of this is that none of the characters seem to have any discernible development, nor are they ever placed in any meaningful danger (as you quickly learn that there are no rules involved and they will always escape in some random and improbable manner).  It's farce, in fantasy novel form, but it's not quite funny or witty enough to feel worth the trouble.<br /><br />However, I know that this is the first book of a widely-read and popular series, and I will give the author the benefit of the doubt that the later books will be better.  So I will continue to read a few more, in hopes that my complaints about The Color of Magic are unique to the volume, and not common to the series.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is a surprisingly good family movie.    Robert DeNiro steals the show.  we really enjoy watching this over an over. You always find something new. Even our 16mth old has to watch it from start to finish.    *The wide screen ed has extra commentaries on the making and casting of the movie as well.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Saw it in the theater.  The movie begins in the mountains and deserts of Afghanistan, as a group of Army Hummers are transporting businessman Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) through the war zone. All of a sudden, explosions begin and shots are fired at the Hummers. US Soldiers are shot and killed.  Stark jumps out of the Hummer and starts running. As an idiot could guess, he doesn't get far before he gets shot and captured.<br /><br />Rewind 36 hours to an award ceremony at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, where Tony Stark is about to get an award for his achievements in the weapons' producing industry. His father began Stark Industries some time ago and Tony took over when Daddy died. Tony was a 6-year old product developer so, at probably 40-something, he is quite proficient now. He remains single and enjoys a romp with the ladies, now and then.  While the award is being handed out, Tony is gambling in Vegas and smoozing the women.  His military liaison (Terrence Howard) comes looking for him in the casino to remind him that he promised to be there for the award, so, you can see the carefree attitude of a stuck-on-himself, filty-rich genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow is his administrative assistant who takes care of everything for him. Stark has an awesome car, his own plane, and a computer system that would probably make Bill Gates drool, complete with holographic imaging. (You will likely recognize Terrance Howard when you see him.)<br /><br />Fast forward back to Afghanistan.  Stark was there to conduct a weapons missle presentation for the US army. Stark was seriously injured. He is hauled off to a terrorist camp.  As he looks around, he notices the camp is loaded with Stark weapons. He begins to realize that his lifetime labors of love have also been going to the \\"bad\\" guys to help them kill Americans.  The terrorists order Stark to build his new missile for them and they will set him free. He knows its a lie but it buys him time to appear to work on the missle. Instead he builds a very special iron man suit.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, with a shaved head, plays an interesting role. I believe he is chairman of the board at Stark Industries, or something similar.  This is a super good action film. Great job by all the actors. Good guys vs. bad guys theme. The computer graphic imaging was great, too. Approximately 2 hrs. Not for young children. (Some people get shot in Afghanistan, and although these scenes were not belabored, I doubt that you want your young impressionable children to carry these images around in their heads.)special iron man suit.

0553213105|5.0|This is probably the most classic romance novel of all time.  I get shivers every time I re-read it and fall in love with the story over and over.  While I love most of Austen's other books, this is the one I return to at least once a year.
0385732554|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry    Have you ever wondered what the world would be like if everything was perfect? What if there was no violence and no hatred? Imagine a world devoid of color and only minor differences exist. Imagine being able to take a pill that solves all of your problems. For the normal person, this type of world seems to be non-existent. There is no way in our world, which is consumed by chaos and violence, could such a perfect place exist. However, if one was to pick up The Giver by Lois Lowry, they would enter a world that is seemingly perfect. After exploring its pages, we begin to question the validity of this utopia. This book is the perfect introduction to utopic societies and leaves the reader wandering, \\"Can a utopia actually exist?\\"    The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in an utopic society. The story begins right before Jonas's Ceremony of Twelve. At this ceremony, all of the students born the same year as Jonas will turn 12 years old and receive their life assignment. Unlike in our society, Jonas and his peers are not able to choose their profession. Rather, they are assigned a profession based off the observations of the elders in the society. Jonas anxiously awaits his ceremony with nervous anticipation. This will be his last ceremony and the most important ceremony of his life. All ceremonies up until this point each presented a new element to Jonas's life. For example, at age one babies leave the nursery and are given to their parents, at age nine students are given their bicycles and become mobile. However, at age 12 students are given their life assignments and officially become adults.    When the big day finally comes, Jonas is told that he would be the new Receiver of Memory. This is the most important job in the community, and only one is selected every several decades. Jonas is afraid and excited to receive his new position. Jonas soon begins his training and falls under the leadership of The Giver. The Giver is the current Receiver of Memory and his job is to hold all of the memories of the world. He slowly begins to give Jonas memories of happiness, love, joy, and excitement.  However, after Jonas becomes comfortable, The Giver begins to give Jonas memories of pain, suffering, sadness, hunger, heartache, and other terrible feelings. Jonas has never been exposed to these things and it becomes very difficult to bear.     Convinced that the community must change so that they too can experience all of the wonderful and painful memories, Jonas and The Giver makes the decision that Jonas will leave the community. After he leaves the community, his memories begin to fade, and it is believed that they fall back on the community which he left. The end of the novel is quite vague. Jonas and baby Gabriel, a child that he has taken with him, are at the top of a snow peeked mountain and begin to ride down on a sled. In the distance he hears what he believes to be music. At that moment the novel abruptly ends. Some speculate that Jonas and baby Gabriel actually die and he is going to heaven. Others suggest that he has returned to his society, except the society now has the memories that he left behind. The author never gives a definitive answer, but it is up to the reader to decide.     This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is written in such a way that it can appeal to readers of all ages. It forces the reader to think outside of the box and dare to imagine a world which is perceivably perfect. It also forces the reader to question their own ideas of perfection and the possibility of a perfect world. I can think of no negative traits about this book. Lowry has truly opened our eyes to a world that is so crazy, that it actually makes sense.
B00104W8T6|4.0|When I saw the movie Juno, I really enjoyed the music.  I also enjoyed the movie.  The music is fresh with  upbeat simple rhythms that compliment the movie and that  also compliment some of the 'not so upbeat' topics the  songs cover...I was very impressed by the fresh sound of  this soundtrack....for the eclectic music collector and for  those looking to hear something a little different than pop radio!

0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart is Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe's first novel. It deals with Nigerian tribal life before and during white colonialism, with particular attention to how tribal culture and white colonial culture come into conflict when white people move in and attempt to convert the natives to Christianity.<br /><br />Things Fall Apart is slow-paced. There is no plot to speak of here beyond antihero Okonkwo's ambitions, and the cultural conflict does not begin until the last quarter of the book. In the meantime, Achebe explores tribal culture in depth, with attention to tradition, religion, ritual, and family structure.<br /><br />Achebe's writing is rather simple (often praised as \\"deceptively simple\\"), and sometimes repetitive. Achebe is a better storyteller than he is a writer, as his protagonist is well-rounded and his supporting characters are sufficiently well-rounded, even though the novel drags at times<br /><br />On the whole, Things Fall Apart is now overrated, but it is still a solid rebuttal to those who glorify white colonialism, as well as an exploration of Nigerian tribal culture.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED

B0000029GA|5.0|This is arguably the greatest hip hop album in history, and my personal favorite.  This is before Nas' mafioso persona and other mishaps (though he's still one of the greatest).  I think the review by Amazon is pretty spot on.  All nine tracks are very lyrical and Nas actually takes the listener's mind on a journey through his surroundings.  The production is tight, ranging from simplistic beats like \\"One Love\\" to very melodic tracks like \\"Memory Lane\\".  I mean, if you're reading this review and you're not convinced or you're still indecisive, just look at the other 500 reviews with five stars, it's not a coincidence.  I highly recommend this to any hip hop fan.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|Mad Men is an outstanding show, one of the high points of the 2007 season and the one I'm most looking forward to returning in 2008.    I had planned to buy the DVD set, but I'm having second thoughts because of the box. It looksl ike it's going to be one of those odd-shaped boxes that looks like an old fashioned lighter. I get the joke, but I'd much rather have a normal box that fits on the shelf with the rest of my collection.     I wish that when companies made these novelty DVD boxes that they also sold a traditional shape. Remember the \\"Homer's Head\\" boxes from the Simpsons Season 6?
B00139W3NE|3.0|This one would have gotten two stars, except for Armored Bears.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I have not read the book, and I am unlikely to, after seeing the movie.  I am glad I waited for the DVD release.<br /><br />The characters were two-dimensional, and we never really get a feeling of WHY they do what they do.<br /><br />The evil is vaguely defined, but not really understood.<br /><br />The bit about a person's soul accompanying that person as an animal sidekick was intriguing, but wasn't exploited, although it was hinted that it was a central issue in the conflict, we were never told why.<br /><br />All in all, the movie seemed to be a collection of favorite scenes from someone's favorite book, but lacked the fabric which connected those scenes into a comprehensible whole.<br /><br />But the Armored Bears were pretty cool!
0131177052|5.0|[...]    This is a must-read for software developers, I think.  It's up there with Code Complete as a must-have, and I think does a better job than Refactoring by Fowler of explaining Refactoring.  I started using some of the techniques in this book immediately and found that coding was higher quality and more enjoyable.  It also helps to understand that the author's definition of \\"legacy code\\" is \\"code without tests\\".

B00026WU82|5.0|From the opening track \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" to the unbelievably deep closer \\"Desolation Row\\", Bob Dylan has crafted what has come to be known as one of his greatest albums, and one of the greatest folk rock albums of all time.  Deceptively complex lyrics, full of subtle meaning and imagery will take you down that lonely highway.  The first album Dylan did with a full band, the music is engrossing.  Dylan's talky vocals are the understating means by which all this is brought to the listener's ear.  I find it hard to describe this album, it takes a few spins to really appreciate the depth of it all.  Anyways, the highlights on this album for me were \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", and \\"Desolation Row\\" but the rest of the tracks are outstanding in their own ways.  If you're curious about Dylan, I think this could be considered a great place to start.  Just be ready to have your view of the world slightly changed by the time you're done.

B00154GEFU|4.0|I've given Phoenix at least a dozen listen-throughs, and feel now that I have enough exposure to write a fair review.     The overall song writing, as well as the musicianship, is excellent. The songs are thoughtful, and a few are down right exceptional. Never Again, Parallel Worlds, and of course Extraordinary Life make the album worth buying. John Wetton, in spite of his challenges and the toll of age, sounds just about as good as he ever did. I measure an album by how many songs I hit the \\"skip\\" button on, and there are only a couple that I've finally decided that gritting my teeth wasn't worth it, and moved on.     The heavy knock that I have to give Phoenix is the poor production. The instruments are all there, but they lack that \\"pop\\" that they should have. Carl Palmer, where art thou? Gone are the days when his thump powered the songs of Asia. There is but one decent drum solo on the whole album, and even THAT doesn't drive into you. I absolutely don't blame Palmer, but the producer. It's a shame, really. Sadly, it's the same with the keyboards and guitars. It's like they're all playing in your living room but don't want to turn up the volume for fear of disturbing the neighbors.     That being said, it's hard not to like the album as a whole. When four musical geniuses get together, it's pretty hard to produce garbage, and there's very little garbage here. If there's ever some enhanced remastering in the future, I may end up changing this to 5-stars.

Kelby reveals the common sense behind the mystery of f-stop, shutter speed, ISO, exposure, aperatures, and every other alien thing that tends to intimidate beginning SLR camera users.  He shows example pictures of what the camera settings discussed will produce, and provides the \\"recipe\\" for many of the common kinds of shots people go for.  It's very readable, even \\"front to back\\" like a novel.  I highly recommend this book!

0553296981|5.0|\\"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\\" is the diary (a non-fiction work) of a Jewish teenager who lived during the Holocaust and World War II.  The book is 304 pages, which includes an introduction written by Eleanor Roosevelt and an afterword, which contains information about what happened to the Frank family after Anne's diary ends.  Bantam published this edition in 1993, although a press in Amsterdam first published the diary in 1947. It was her father, Otto Frank, who went back to the place where the family hid for over two years, found the diary, and decided to publish it.  Originally, parts in which Anne discusses and expresses her romantic feelings were cut out of the book, as the publisher felt they were too risqu&eacute;; but when the diary was published in the U.S., these parts were put back into the book.  This edition also includes photographs of Anne Frank, as well as photocopies of the actual pages of the diary.  By including these, the reader is really able to get a sense of Anne's personality through her handwriting. The Reading level of this book is about an 8.2, meaning it is perfect for 8th graders, or those who read at about an 8th grade reading level, although it is a book you will read over and over, even after you become an adult.<br /><br />The diary is fascinating to read--Anne begins the diary on her thirteenth birthday, weeks before her family goes into hiding.  As the war rages in Europe, Anne is forced to wear a gold star, designating her as Jewish, but her life continues in a relatively normal way.  This all changes when a note arrives, stating that the Nazi's want her older sister, Margot.  The Frank family hides, spending their next two years in a secret annex in the building where Otto Frank worked.  Anne and her family share their space with four other people--Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan (business associates of Mr. Frank), their son, Peter, and Mr. Dussel.  Anne is faced with the challenge of living out her adolescence in such a confined space.<br /><br />As you read her diary, you will be able to relate to the range of emotions Anne displays.  She gets excited about events, she feels scared and nervous about her life, she falls in love and receives her first kiss while in hiding, she feels jealousy towards her sister, and she often feels anger and resentment toward her mother.  If you did not know the context of her life, Anne might seem like a normal teenager you might know.  Yet, as she wonders about whether Peter likes her or not, she also has to worry about if someone will betray the family.  She lives in constant fear of discovery, and everyday, the seven hidden members of their Annex follow the news, praying for the defeat of the Nazis, so that they can once again live their lives.  Ultimately, tragedy strikes Anne and her family, but Anne's words have given generations of teenagers a glimpse into what it was really like living through the Holocaust.  I found this book to be so wonderful that I can't say anything bad about it, and I encourage everyone to read this dairy so that you too can understand what it was like to be a teenager living through the Holocaust.space.<br /><br />As you read her diary, you will be able to relate to the range of emotions Anne displays.

0307265730|5.0|In this brilliant book, Lahiri sustains her control of characters and weaves tight stories.  Her plots and characters move effortlessly through each vignette.  Once again we meet the structured Bengali culture and their American children who never seem to completely belong in either world.<br /><br />The stories emphasize intermarriage between a Bengali and an American but their coming together seems natural and no definitive blame is placed on troubled intermarriages. I had originally thought the stories wold be linked but only two were related directly.<br /><br />Arranged marriages often make life easier .  We learn about the strict, almost inflexible, Bengali families who come to America and desperately retain their sharp divide of women's place and the man's responsibility in a marriage.  Not so when a Bengali girl or boy marries an American.  Many of the alliances seemed anguished and incomplete.  I didn't feel any of the characters could find contentment.<br /><br />What held every story together, whether it was a drunken husband or a grieving wife missing her Bengali mother, was the demanding emphasis on education.  The Bengali expected their American son or daughter to become dstinctively educated at the very best Ivy schools to attain optimum success in their fields.  This theme seem the overriding reason for coming to America.  The Bengali wives remained tied to their Indian cultures and continued their obsequious responses to their husbands.  They remained isolated and out of touch.  Not their children who desperately tried to find a place for themselves in our rich country and liberal culture.<br /><br />This was a wonderful book; she is one of the best authors.  We are thrown into the plots from the very first sentences.  She reminds me of Anne Tyler, taking simple people who live mundane lives, but who are quite complicated and intense.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver  Lowery, Lois  Published by Laurel Leaf (2002)  Reading Level: 6.5  192 Pages  Youth Science Fiction     I remember reading The Giver for the first time as an emerging adolescent. For the first time I can remember, a novel challenged me to do more than just imagine. This powerful novel (to the my delight) forced me to consider and evaluate the circumstances and situations the author describes. Lois Lowry weaves together a provocative narrative that challenges our assumptions about the desirability of a utopian world, and explores the dark underside that so often accompanies flawed human attempts at manufacturing perfection. The story is less about Jonas, a 12-year old boy who is designated to become the receiver of memories, than it is about the twisted modern utopia he inhabits.     The story is set in a world without extremes. There is no pain, no suffering, and no poverty, but at the same time, no joy, no meaning, and no love. The cost of ridding the world of its ills is sacrificing many of its greatest virtues.  By introducing the reader into the sterile world Jonas is born into, and accompanying him as he breaks through personal and societal barriers, Lowry invites her audience to consider controversial issues about freedom of choice, the nature of authentic experiences, the conditions of righteous rebellion, the intrinsic value of human life, and the price of a painless existence.    Jonas's experience reminds us of the simple joys we tend to take for granted in our world, full of endless variation, possibility, challenge, and choice. In the (literally) black and white world that Jonas inhabits, experiencing everything from the fundamental concepts of color and hunger to simple pleasures and pains like sledding and sunburns leaves Jonas profoundly changed. The way Jonas grows and matures through learning about his environment reminds the reader of how important it is to seek out new knowledge to better understand our world and ourselves.    Despite the striking differences between the modern world and the society Jonas is born into, many of the decisions that Jonas grapples with upon discovering the true nature of his utopian existence are similar to those every teenager and adult must make as he or she matures to gain wisdom, and with it, responsibility. It is almost painful to watch Jonas, at a mere 12 years of age, carry the enormous burden of remembering (and experiencing) the imperfections and wonders of the past alone. Jonas's journey, beginning with his passage into adulthood with the Ceremony of Twelve, and culminating with his decision to flee the only world he has ever known (to what end, we will never know...), reveals the incredible range of emotions we all know well as the human experience.
B0013J30XG|5.0|Somebody insisted that this film is only for kids 6-15. I am 52 years old, and I absolutely was blown away by 'Speedracer'.    I did not grow up with the 'Speedracer' cartoon. I know very little about the storylines. I also have learned that, over the years, not to always listen to critics, especially during the summer when films like 'Iron-Man' are dominating theatres. That said, 'Speedracer', from the makers of 'Matrix', is another extremely imaginative film. 'Speedracer' is FILLED (I emphasize this) with: tons of exciting car action (of course), loads of humor, a lot of tender moments, GREAT special effects, and a lot more action. And the music is fantastic. Watching 'Speedracer' is an experience, like a Disneyland ride. You are sitting in the theatre, but the filmmakers somehow pull you into the action (this wasn't IMAX). It's thrilling. As for the actors? Goodman, Sarandon, Hirsch (as Speedracer) and Christina Ricci, not to mention the rest of the cast, are just having fun with the rest of us. The story is good vs. evil, nothing more. What else do we need from a wonderful thrill ride??? Please don't listen to critics. And please consider what this poorly marketed film has to deal with: 'Iron-Man', next week 'Narnia', then 'Indiana Jones'... The list goes on. No wonder 'Speedracer' gets lost in the shuffle. This is a film that may be before its' time, as was 'Matrix'. Go see 'Speedracer'. It's for the kids. It's for the adults. And it is never offensive.    'Speedracer' is so exciting and warm-hearted and funny you will find yourself laughing and cheering all at the same time while you are trying in vain to wipe away the tears in your eyes. See it just once. I guarantee you will want to tell your friends. They will love it!!!
B000002552|5.0|As quickly as I can, the missing material being replaced by throwaway songs from The Band is not primarily a historical issue. It definitely is a historical issue, but the primary concern is of quality.     For those interested, here's a list of some [emphasis on some] of the best stuff missing from this collection:     All You Have to Do is Dream [version one is the better of the two]--one of Dylan's finest. Understated lyrics with an underlying depth that leave you second guessing each reading of the song. Beautifully performed by all involved.     Rock, Salt, and Nails--beautiful Utah Phillips' song. I've never heard a better vocal from Dylan or a more delicate performance from The Band.     Get Your Rocks Off--filthy lyrics, filthy performance. The lyrics remind me a bit of \\"Rainy Day Women\\" in that they front as a series of naughty puns but carry a greater weight. The song is just ideal. Dylan at his bluesy best.     Quinn the Eskimo--very fun song. And the two best versions of the song [un]available.     I'm not There (1956)--now available on the otherwise poor soundtrack for the film of the same title, many say it's the best song of all the Basement material. I don't, but it is beautiful and haunting.     Don't Ya Tell Henry--Dylan's version. Supremely better than The Band's. The lyrics remind me of \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" except, Dylan is having a poke at his own perceptions. I like to think of it as \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" ran through a deeply religious experience. The quirky brass reminds me a bit of some of Tom Waits' 80's material.     Too Much of Nothing V2--better than the version here. Great song either way.     I Shall Be Released--available on the Bootleg volume's 1-3 [disc 2], one of Dylan's greatest songs and greatest performances [the ultimate performance of the song].     Santa Fe--like \\"I'm not There,\\" the lyrics are a bit difficult to make out at times, and like \\"I'm not There,\\" the beautiful performance makes the lyrics almost unnecessary.Silent Weekend--not my favorite, but a good number of people rate it as one of the better songs from the sessions. It's a good song.     Sing on the Cross--brilliant song. Dylan never wrote a more haunting chorus. It's very strange in that the verses and the drunken rant seem to be a good deal of nonsense swirling around that very pointed chorus, but it definitely works together.     I'm a Fool for You--starts beautifully and falls apart. Still worth hearing for said start.     Next Time on the Highway--great bluesy rock song. Clever lyrics, great performance by all involved.     See You Later, Allen Ginsberg--worth mentioning for its silliness.     Big River--after a warm up, Dylan out-man's Cash and out-sneers Lou Reed and Iggy Pop.     Ol' Roison Le Beau--beautiful drinking song. The distortion doesn't hurt any.     . . .    I'm stilling giving this poorly-selected collection five stars for the great songs it does have, but I have to believe that they'll eventually release the rest of the real basement tapes.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This movie has been and remains my favorite movie of all time. I was about Sarah's age when it came out and my quite young mom (34) had just passed away, so my ability to relate to the character was incredible - see Deborah MacGillivray's review, she really nails the emotion/feeling of the film (and YES I DID want that dress!! LOL). It's a really sweet, imaginative (how could anything Jim Henson did not be?), heartwarming story that shows us there is love, friendship and a reason to be no matter how much our 'world falls down'. Give it a look, you'll be glad you did :)
B00004TL2N|4.0|The intriguing combination of Boulez and Bruckner (not quite as unlikely as it may sound given the conductor's credentials in Wagner) yields and Eighth of undoubted interest, though in the final reckoning not one that quite matches the crowning achievements by Giulini, Wand or even Chailly. In the first three movements Boulez offers his signature clarity, and a firm hand on the tiller without unduly subduing the powerful moments. His attention to middle voices is extraordinary; despite the unhelpful acoustics of Sankt Florian church, and without any deliberate spotlighting, he draws your attention to busy harmonic figuration in the violas or second violins. There is a deep sense of the multi-layered canvas that this work is, and rewards are plenty. Nor is the conductor insensitive to the strange, twilit moods Bruckner can conjure up, especially when moving from one theme to another or at the start of a development section. This orchestra is of course naturally attuned to this music, and the solo playing is sensitive and beautiful throughout.<br /><br />The tight rhythmic control makes the first movement sound more purposeful than in some other readings, and the Scherzo has plenty of energy, even if it lacks the last ounce of bucolic exuberance. The complex rhythm that accompanies the Adagio main theme is again articulated clearly and with confidence rather than glossed over as happens too often. Unfortunately, though, Boulez shows little sense of mystery when his violins climb to crystalline spheres - the result sounds too matter of fact. The somewhat glassy-sounding harp doesn't help (much as it didn't in Karajan's famous recording with the same orchestra).<br /><br />It is the finale where the reading falters. The tempo is simply too fast (\\"Solemnly, not fast\\" is Bruckner's indication), and fluctuates too much along the way. The spectacular \\"battle music\\", where the main theme is propelled along by inexorable timpani, apart from being too fast to begin with, is even given an unmarked accelerando, as if Boulez has his mind set on turning the music into Mahler. The final peroration, one of the great goose pimple moments in music, is undone by the unsuitable church acoustics, and comes off like a big, booming blur. Weirdly, the liner notes claim that while church acoustics are often very troublesome, they aren't in this case, because after all Bruckner himself played the organ at Sankt Florian. As if that has got anything to do with it! In all, it is very unfortunate, because here in particular perfect balance is essential to make audible how Bruckner achieved the non plus ultra of the cyclical principle: while Beethoven in his Ninth was content to recall the themes from earlier movements successively, Bruckner has them sound simultaneously. You can hardly hear that in this recording, nor do the trumpets succeed to realize their \\"hervortretend\\" and punctuate the clamour with their jubilant fanfares.<br /><br />I've detected no audience noise in this live recording, but did notice occasional rough edges to the VPO's ensemble playing. The recorded sound is not at all bad overall, quite warm and surprisingly detailed in softer passages - though the bass is a bit thick and lacks clear definition.arked accelerando, as if Boulez has his mind set on turning the music into Mahler.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|It was very entertaining.  My kids loved the music.  The makeup was great and so was the dancing.  I really liked it alot.  I had the video, but it became worn out from watching it so much.  Now we have the DVD.  It sure is a family pleaser.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|Too many movie soundtracks these days are either the symphonic variety kind (think John Williams) or compilations of various artists, more often than not without any particular cohesiveness, other than say all-pop acts or all-R&B acts. Eddie Vedder comes along with his first solo album, and reminds us how great movie soundtracks really work.<br /><br />On \\"Into the Wild\\" (11 tracks; 33 min.) Vedder takes the main themes of the movie and translates them into songs, often short, and often just Vedder and acoustic guitar, but not always. There are a couple of intrumentals as well. To me it's hard to pinpoint to \\"highlights\\" as such on here, as this album is a musical mood companion to the movie. If you've seen the movie, you know what I mean (and if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? rent it already!). As others have pointed out, the last track \\"Guaranteed\\" is actually the same song twice (vocal, and instrumental).<br /><br />In all, this is a fantasic album. No, this isn't going to sell a bezillion copies, but so what. \\"Into the Wild\\" is what a soundtrack should be. It reminds me in spirit of that other seminal soundtrack that came out 25 years ago this year: 1983's soundtrack of \\"Local Hero\\" by Mark Knopfler (which coincidentally also was the Dire Straits' frontman's first solo album), and in my mind one of the best soundtracks EVER. \\"Into the Wild\\" comes close, and I can't wait to see where Eddie Vedder will go from here musically as a solo act.
0439882826|5.0|When I saw this book on Martha Stewarts' program, I knew I had to purchase it as a gift for my son-in-law who collects Star Wars items.  This pop-up book is so creative and my son-in-law loves it , as well as, my two grandsons.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|I admit I hadn't heard of MGMT until I heard them on WOXY (\\"BAM! The Future of Rick & Roll!), the internet-only station that brings you the best indie-music in this country, bar none!<br /><br />\\"Oracular Spectecular\\" (10 tracks, 40 min.) is the debut album of MGMT, and starts off with an exubertant (and radio single) \\"Time to Pretend\\", the best track on the album. The band brings a mix of techno-rock along with more off-center sounds, and it all sounds great. Other highlights on this album include \\"Weekend Wars\\", which starts off acoustic but then evolves just great, a stomping \\"Electric Feel\\", a dizzying \\"4th Dimension Transition\\" and the closer \\"Future Reflections\\", which summarizes the album perfectly.<br /><br />In all, this is quite a nice debut album. I had the good fortune of catching these guys live a few weeks ago at the Coachella music festival, where they brought most of these songs live, and it sounded even better than on the album. They worked the Mojave tent where they played to a frenzy, quite the experience. In all, this debut album is quite nice and I can't wait to see where MGMT will go from here!
B00008WJBU|3.0|The idea of this movie is that some people can steal luck from others.<br /><br />The idea is brillant, but this movie could have been so much better.<br />I'm a big fan of foreign movies and I have seen this one on the shelf for years, but just got around to watching it.<br /><br />The story moves at a good pace, but sputters in several places before a so, so ending!<br /><br />Intacto (Intact) is worth seeing, only once!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Duffy [she only uses her last name] is a new girl from across the pond, and she should have a bright future, indeed. The sound is definitely 60s pop, and Duffy has a most clear, pleasant voice, with almost a \\"little girl\\" quality. Of course, she would have no business dealing with this subject matter were she actually still a little girl. These are ten very well done songs about various aspects of relationship problems.<br /><br />The opening title track sets a serious [not really dark] mood...\\"Warwick Avenue\\", which is my personal favorite, and \\"Stepping Stone\\" deal with communication breakdown, and a perfectly normal wish not to be used; \\"Serious\\" is about a pretty girl's resentment of being just a cute sex object, while the albums \\"big hit\\" \\"Mercy\\", the most modern sounding number, takes the theme a bit further...a girl naturally wants to make her own sexual choices. \\"Warwick Avenue\\" is the only cut in which I picked up the album's geographic origin...\\"tube\\", instead of \\"subway\\".<br /><br />Duffy is a pretty girl, with a fine voice. Whether 37'51\\" is too short, I'll leave up to you...the album seems to go by rapidly, and only a good record does that. What we have here is, hopefully, the opening act of a fine career. Duffy is very good; time, and maturity, should only make her better.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I don't know what to say about this film except that it was absolutely wonderful! I cried alot during the movie, except when I was laughing. This is my new favorite movie to cry along with!!
0440178002|5.0|Great book about the westernization of Japan and the conflict between European and Japanese cultures in the 17th century. The character development is amazing especially between the main character, Anjin-san, and the Japanese interpreter, Mariko, with whom he falls in love. There is also a considerable amount of action as the samurai class slides into a war that will determine the next shogunate of Japan.
B000VDDWDS|4.0|From the opening cannon battle's visceral sound design you know you're in for a treat with this dts-HD Master Audio presentation from Fox. For several years now we've had high resolution digital audio for our music, but only over the last two years has it finally hit the video market. Master and Commander on DVD was a disc I was impressed with for the quality of the 768Mbps dts track, but good Lord the improvement of this Blu-ray track is seven-fold. I continue to be impressed by the sound quality on Fox's discs, including Independence Day, I, Robot, The Day After Tomorrow, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and now Master and Commander. This is what home theatre is about! All speakers are in use here and the directionality is spot on. I truly believe I have cannons beside my sofa, powerful, heavy cannons. Not for the faint of heart is this one at reference level volumes.<br /><br />Where picture quality is concerned there are one or two scenes that I did find to be not eye-popping, but these are few and far between. On the DVD release of Master and Commander there are many scenes in the ship under-deck that are a mess, with mpeg-noise all over the place, a shortcoming of DVD's bandwidth. On the Blu-ray Disc you'll find no such errors. The level of detail watching this movie on a 1080p plasma is incredible and there are no complaints whatsoever of the day scenes. Although this will not compare when stood beside the sheen of I, Robot, one of the most incredible pictures I've experienced so far on Blu-ray, it definitely is a huge improvement over its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />Fox have made very little effort here with the extras, but have included D-Box functionality for those with a bit more money to spend on their theatre seating. That is not something I can afford so I can't comment on it, but D-Box tracks are starting to catch the attention of the other studios and you will see Disney or Sony Blu-ray's coming soon with D-Box tracks. If you want to go more into the history of the time there are numerous special features on the DVD, but with the movie already running 137 minutes this is one reviewer that has yet to ever pop in that second disc, ever. Missing out on porting over the DVD extras is something a lot of reviewers, amateur and professional, gripe about. I do not care for extras if they are in standard definition. I have all three of the Lord of the Rings Platinum Edition 4-DVD sets, I bought them because of the 6.1 dts:es tracks and the extended footage. That amounts to 6 DVD's that have never been released from their plastic teeth. I will likely watch some of them when the inevitable Blu-ray Disc versions come out if they are in 1080p, but otherwise I just don't have the time to watch that much extra footage about each movie I buy. Master and Commander is a pretty incredible movie with excellent performances all round and the subject matter is interesting, but when the movie's over, turn out the lights.<br /><br />I dock Fox 1-star for not including the extras for those that have never bought the original DVD, but this release for the sheer improvement of audio and picture quality and being able to enjoy this on a large screen that even the best up-converter for DVD's cries beside, gets 4-stars.<br /><br />For those wishing to wait for the \\"inevitable\\" double dip, consider renting this title from your local Blockbuster or Netflix, you'll not be disappointed.<br /><br />Picture Quality - 4/5<br />Sound Quality - 5/5 (Reference!)<br />Extras - 1/5y of the time there are numerous special features on the DVD, but with the movie already running 137 minutes this is one reviewer that has yet to ever pop in that second disc, ever.

B00151G08Y|5.0|In all honesty, I did not like this album to begin with. I got into the DnB scene because I grabbed \\"Hold Your Colour\\" after hearing \\"Fasten Your Seatbelt\\" in a flash. I still listen to since grabbing it 2 years ago, it's an incredible album. That said, when I got \\"In Silico\\" a week or so ago(in advance release from a friend), I thought, \\"wtf is with all this singing?\\" and \\"these tracks all sound a little same-y\\". The Pendulum I once \\"knew\\" was dead, in my mind.         Interestingly, as I listened to it in the following weeks, the more I began to realize that this new Pendulum style was actually good, very good! It's geared toward everything being played live, so of course the will use the same instruments more often, and it's to wonderful effect. The singing isn't as prevalent as I once thought, usually it's in the first minute or so, then Rob makes way for the music to take over. Just got the CD today, now I can enjoy some quality rips.     If you're new to Pendulum, grab this, you'll love it! If you're a previous fan of Pendulum, give the album a chance, it will grow on you.
0312360266|2.0|I guess even though I'm still a \\"young adult\\" I've moved passed the high school fiction.  And I don't mean that I don't read books that are based in high schools, I just don't read things that are written in the sort of language and grammer that a high schooler would use in a note to a friend.    The book was a typical high school novel with a mystical side.  There wasn't a whole lot of depth to the story and even though it had an interesting plot it could have been taken a lot further.     Powerful and faultless heroine takes down the evil bully with the help of her always-there, less-than-interesting friends and gets the hottest guy in the school. end of story.     I also didn't appreciate the broad illustrations as the pagan cult of the vampyres as perfect and beautiful while the \\"people of faith\\" are portrayed as generally heartless and uncaring.    Not a bad story for a teen girl or anyone else who wants a light and uncomplicated read. But it is NOT at all compatible with Twilight by Stephenie Meyer.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Great story, great acting, great score, what more can you ask.  A true classic in every sense of the word.
0007271239|4.0|I bought this based on Peter Egan's review in Road & Track. It's a touching story with a unique twist - the narrator is a dog named Enzo. The dog's acknowlegement of his unique ability to think like a human and penchant for philosophical wanderings give the story a slightly fantastical flavor. The other elements are grounded in reality: love and marriage, childbirth, death, racing and evil step-parents. I'd recommend this book to any fan of racing, dogs or dramatic fiction.
B000002MP2|2.0|This was another album I loved in middle school. MTV loved it, Rolling Stone loved it, so I bought it. It's catchy pop music. Sorry, but it's not punk music. Not even close. This is fun pop music but nothing particularly insightful or ground breaking and will not stand the test of time.
B00192IOBA|5.0|I have a pretty solid Jason Mraz collection and this is a perfect addition. Mraz does not disapoint. It's a clear progression from his last album. He's definitely an artist that doesn't stagnate in one music style for entire career. He tries new things and he succeeds! It's likely the best I've ever felt after listening to an album. You can't not smile.
B000003TA4|1.0|Then I grew up and realized that I don't have to buy music just because MTV or Rolling Stone says it's good. Nirvana sucked and had limited, if any, musical talent. The only member who had any talent was Dave Grohl. This album was totally cut and pasted in the studio to be mass marketed and it shows. Cobain couldn't play the guitar, couldn't sing, and his lyrics were nonsensical whining. Do your ears and your mind a favor and pick up some rock music played by actual musicians.
B0001Z363W|4.0|Mr. Wylde has produced a simple, beautiful, understated album that reveals his true talent. I came across this one by mistake, and it was my first Zakk purchase! Well, it really set me up for becoming a fan. This album, even after hearing his work with BLS and Ozzy, is still my fave. As a rock fan and a burgeoning rock guitarist, this album is awesome. Granted, it is for the mellow times. But you MUST hear the beautiful, soulful guitar work on Won't Find it There and the devastatingly accurate flamenco-inspired 40 second song Takillya (Estyabon). This man is a fabulous guitarist, and on this album he shows his true colors, his blue moods, with the amps turned down.<br /><br />I read a Guitar One magazine interview when this was released that Mr.Wylde wanted the listener to know how he feels when the show is over, what's goin' on in his head on the bus in the morning, something the listener could relate to in a soulful way. Well, mr. Wylde, you nailed it. This album, from beginning to end (including a moving cover of Whiter Shade of Pale), is a beautiful composition to enjoy on a nice drive, with a cup of coffee in the morning, or especially late at night when everyone's asleep and you need to find yourself alone and mellow. Enjoy this masterpiece. Personally, I still can't believe it's the same guy that produced those searing shredding heavy metal tones with Ozzy and on albums like Sonic Brew and Alcohol Fueled Brewtality (live!). Good work, Mr. Wylde. This one will keep you coming back.
B000148KK2|5.0|There's no doubt, in my opinion \\"The Girl in Other Room\\" is one of my best CDs I have. Just buy it!
B00104QSOM|3.0|To me, this is a typical PT Anderson film.  It has great sequences in it. It also has incredibly bad ones.  It's overlong (and I love long films).<br />It has great performances, and it has bad ones.  Its dialogue is awful.  It has great cinemtography and production design, but thematically it's a mess.  In other words, There Will Be Blood is an incredibly uneven film, which is consistent with all of PT Anderson's work.<br /><br />PT Anderson is an anomaly in his age bracket.  He's a Gen X director, but has no real sense of Gen X \\"irony\\" or smugness.  He has ambition coming out of every pore of his body.  You have to admire the hell out of him for that.  He wants to make the great, grand picture.  Most of his peers make very shallow films (Tarantino's Grindhouse is a good example).  I can't imagine PT Anderson watching Switchblade Sisters and saying \\"this is a great film\\".  I can see him saying \\"that chick is hot, but I still shouldn't be watching this garbage\\".  Having said that, he just can't make a really consistent film.  This was his first film in nearly 6 years (the last one was Punch Drunk Love in 2001), and overall, There Will Be Blood is a mess.<br /><br />There is a lot of good here.  The cinematography is gorgeous.  It's one of the most beautifully shot films I've seen in a while.  The production design is fantastic (by Jack Fisk, one of the best in the business).  The acting by Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing.  Lewis's face, eyes, and voice are so expressive that you forget some of the bad dialogue that you can't take your eyes off of him.  There are some downright surreal, intense scenes.  When Daniel Day Lewis kills his \\"brother\\", it's one of the most effective scenes in the film.  Music, look, acting, it all gels.  The next scene (in a church) is purposely overlit, and continues the surrealism.  It's very good.  The rest of the film continues the haunted look, which I really liked.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these good things are undone by many bad things.  The dialogue here has to be some of the worst I've heard in a long time.  Andreson has never been able to write really good dialogue, and here it's really bad.  Lewis's monologues are really obvious, and the infamous line \\"I drink your milkshake\\" has entered into movie folklore, but not for the majesticness of the speech, but for the camp value.  There's also a really, really bad line in one of Paul Dano's (Eli Sunday is the name of the character.  Rather obvious for a preacher, eh?) where he says \\"I will gum you!\\".  The townspeople are portrayed as simpletons, something that seems to always happen in period pieces like this.  There is no real motivation for Lewis's character other than he is greedy.  Thematically, his desertion of his son (he does it twice in the film) makes no sense.  One scene he is playing with the boy, then the boy goes deaf, then Lewis puts him on a train.  Then he comes back.  Then later in the film, Lewis tells his son he's an orphan who Lewis just used as a prop to get people to go along with his plans.  This is obviously not true, but there is no explanation, narratively or artistically, as to why there's such inconsistency.  PT Anderson seems to be stuck between a straightforward narrative and a surreal tone, and it doesn't work.  And the final scene, while beautifully shot and designed, is unintentionally funny, much like the frogs finale in Magnolia.<br /><br />Dano's character is poorly drawn.  Many have said he was miscast, but I would argue that he just didn't have a good character to build on.  He's the cliched preacher.  The rest of the character are caricatures.  The music score is another problem.  Sometimes it's perfect (like in the brother's death scene), other times it's so out of place.  Anderson was trying to do someting different obviously, but it just doesn't work overall.  The score is reminiscent of Stravinsky and Mozart, and sounds more like a symphony than a film score.  Many have said that Johnny Greenwood's score would make a good listening experience in itself, away from the film.  They're right.<br /><br />Many have said that PT Anderson borrows (or steals) from Kubrick here.  He does.  The leaps in time recall the abrupt time changes in 2001 and Full Metal Jacket, the madness of Lewis recalls The Shining (he's even walking the same way Jack Nicholson does at the end of The Shining), and the eerie, deliberately uttered dialogue in the final scene is reminiscent of the billard room scene in Eyes Wide Shut.  Anderson also said in interviews he wanted to emulate the Dawn of Man sequence in 2001 in the opening of the film (which has minimal dialogue).  Regardless of whether Anderson is ripping off Kubrick or simply being influenced by him (there is a difference between the two), the whole film still doesn't flow, like 2001, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut do.<br /><br />So, overall, this film has enough great moments in it to view it.  It is not as good as Citizen Kane or Giant.  Those films had a lot of depth and character that this one simply lacks.  See There Will Be Blood (great title, by the way) for Daniel Day Lewis, the cinematography, production design, and, if you're into that sort of thing, laugh at the unintentionally funny scenes.ning experience in itself, away from the film.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Regardless of the enhancements, it is a great box set.  By the way, the minor enhancements were done by George Lucas. He does have the right to change some of the special effects for DVD if he wants to.  The guts of the movie are still the original and the very few changes are hardly noticeable.  He was only trying to incorporate the older versions slightly with the newer 1-3 series and special effects.  Honestly, if you enjoy star wars and aren't a big snob about minor insignificant details, then you'll love this set just as much as the videos with the convenience of the DVD. We enjoyed sharing it with our kids who all have watched the video version and the DVD versions with no issues.  It's just entertainment.  There are a lot more things to enjoy in life.  Star wars is just one of those things to watch and enjoy.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Death at a Funeral is one of my favorite movies of all time! I googled Matthew MacFadyen last summer (Darcy in latest Pride and Prejudice) and it turns out he is the lead in Death at a Funeral. I think this movie is hilarious! I've seen it 30 times now and still roar laughing. One scatalogical scene that I don't care for, but the rest is fabulous.

The cards themselves are very well made, with a plastic coating that has so far proven impervious to wear and tear.     This set has all of the Kanji required for the 4th and 3rd levels of the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test.) In addition to the basic character and it's readings, each card lists several different vocabulary combinations. These include words needed for the lower levels of the JLPT, as well as more complex formulations that will be seen on the 1st or 2nd level of the test. They also list words and phrases that may not appear on the JLPT, but that are useful to know.    While nothing can take the place of a Japanese class or at least a textbook, these Kanji cards are an excellent way to improve you reading and writing skills and expand your vocabulary.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm an Evanescence fan.  This album was recorded while Ben Moody was still a member of the band and he keeps most of the songs moving.  Amy's voice is unbelievable.  This album will become a classic.  I don't think that the band will ever equal it (without Ben).
B000YABYLA|5.0|This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Juno is funny, and  has the Super Bad type of comedy, but is also deeper and has a better plot. Juno gets pregnant by Paulie Bleeker, and can't go through with an abortion.  She picks a couple to adopt her baby, and just wants a good life for her baby.  It is never a question of whether she would keep her baby, she always wants to give it up for adoption.  Bleeker, meanwhile, loves Juno and you see the trials of their relationship throughout the movie. She seems to be the one more scared of commitment. The adoptive parents are obviously not happily married, so the ending has a surprising twist that you don't expect, but realize it's the best way for the movie to go. The movie has a great ending that is heartfelt and will have the viewer satisfied.  I highly recommend this movie.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|British starlet Duffy debuts in the U.S. with a fantastic first outing, ROCKFERRY.  Sure, she doesn't have the throaty vocals of Amy Winehouse, the soft controlled soulful vocals of Corinne Bailey Rae, or the soulful, vocal inflections of Joss Stone, but she does have a distinctive voice herself.  She's not completely soulful, but she's also not completely pop in nature, which makes Duffy quite the viable crossover artist in between the two extremes.  There is enough singer-songwriter about her to allow her to rock (albeit softly), and enough grit and nuance within her vocals to allow her to belt it out.  Coupled with the pop-soul production backdrops, the results in which Duffy yields are great.  I have no doubt she could see success here in the U.S.  Much like James Morrison, she has certain soul to her that sometimes comes up short is contemporary soul in the U.S.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Rockferry\\", a great singer-songwriter tune that is more pop than soul. However, listening to the title track, you can't help but hear a certain caliber of soul within Duffy's vocals.  \\"Warwick Avenue\\" has a certain pop-soul feel to it, similar to Corinne Bailey's \\"poppier\\" songs.  The arrangement makes you reminiscent of a song that Dionne Warwick would've sang in the late 1960s/early 1970s.  The strings are absolutely to die for here, given this track an incredible retro feel.  \\"Serious\\", continues this trend and may just be the most soulful tune up until this point.  Vintage sounding electric piano, lush strings, and rhythmic guitars make you feel like you're enjoying the glory days when all music was connected in the 1970s.  Here vocally, Duffy sounds incredible, with her somewhat whiny, yet overall enjoyable vocals.<br /><br />\\"Stepping Stone\\" proves not to disappoint either, with its subtle, restrained production work.  Here, Duffy's vocals shine strongly over the understated production work.  Again here, Duffy balances pop with soul for an excellent fusion between the two, which is maintained throughout ROCKFERRY.  The following two tracks, \\"Syrup and Honey\\" and \\"Hanging On Too Long\\" are by far my favorite tracks of ROCKFERRY.  \\"Syrup and Honey\\" is by far the albums most obvious soul-cut, which reminds me a track that would be right at home on a vintage soul album or a missing track from Amy Winehouse's BACK TO BLACK album.  Here on \\"Syrup and Honey\\", Duffy definitely earns her vocal credibility, if only for her soulful \\"Baby, baby, baby\\" during the end of the verses.  It is the perfect track in which every inflection and nuance by Duffy is Grammy worthy.  \\"Hanging On Too Long\\" similarly proves to ooze of understated-soul, which may be what truly makes Duffy sound so great.  Vocally, this is another on-point performance, with an incredibly catchy refrain.<br /><br />\\"Mercy\\" continues the consistency of ROCKFERRY,  lifting production work from vintage soulful productions.  \\"Delayed Devotion\\" is another nearly perfect track, which sounds like something that Olivia Newton-John would sing in the 1970s (though Duffy is much better).  Catchy with a great poppy nature, \\"Delayed Devotion\\" is another 5 star track in my eyes.  \\"I'm Scared\\" and \\"Distant Dreamer\\" end this exceptional album just as strongly as \\"Rockferry\\" opened it.<br /><br />Essentially, I believe this album is one of 2008's best.  Duffy could possibly be another commercially successful British import here in the U.S. in my eyes.  Even if she isn't, she has certainly released one of 2008s best albums nonetheless.  That in itself is a gargantuan accomplishment.  Excellent vocals, excellent songwriting, excellent production-work.  4 ½ stars Duffy!!!h is maintained throughout ROCKFERRY.

0792838068|3.0|I was shocked that Nicholas Cage actually won a Best Actor award for his performance in this film. Cage is not a very strong actor and all he did was simply act drunk throughout the entire film; 1995 most have been a pretty slow year. The screenplay wasn't bad although it was a little cheesy. Worth renting, but not buying.
B00006JSS8|3.0|I am a big fan of Stevie Wonder but I don't entirely agree with what songs make up the Definitive Collection.
B000002L9Y|4.0|Things really were falling apart for the classic lineup of Fleetwood Mac when Tango In The Night was recorded.  Buckingham finally got fed up with the group.  Nicks was in rehab or involved with her solo career for much of the recording sessions, essentially forcing herself in at the end.  Despite the turmoil, Fleetwood Mac came away with a record that proved to be a strong chart success and saw them return to heavy airplay.    Much of Lindsey Buckingham's material was recorded only by him with little involvement from the rest of the band.  He committed quite a few songs that he had been working on for a solo effort to the band's album.  His work here is pretty good, though definitely stuck in the 1980s when it comes to production and the overall sound.  Like the rest of the album, Buckingham's songs don't sound as timeless here as the other Mac albums do.  Big Love is Buckingham's big radio standout from Tango.  He definitely did a lot of experimentation with sound on this album and came up with some very unique songs that do grow on you.  Caroline and Tango in the Night fall into this category.  Family Man is a more straightforward 80s pop song.  The album closer, You and I, Pt. 2, is another poppy song that is catchy.    Christine McVie is, once again, magnificent.  Her contributions proved to be the big hits off this album.  Everywhere and Little Lies were radio staples in the late 80s.  Mystified is one of her lighter songs that pulls the album back again but keeps your attention - another pretty gem from McVie.  She then changes it up with the straight up rocker Isn't It Midnight.  Christine McVie is definitely the star of this album.    So if I praise these two then why the four stars?  Stevie Nicks.    Nicks' voice here sounds horrible.  It's too high and nasally.  I'm not sure if it was something that happened because of the issues surrounding her drug and alcohol problems at the time or the production or both.  McVie's voice is slightly higher too but still sounds smooth.    Nicks' contributions are also subpar.  Her big hit off this record, Seven Wonders, is pretty good (aside from Nicks' nasally, whiny voice) but was written by Sandy Stewart.  Welcome to the Room... Sara seems to be a continuation of Sara off of Tusk.  It's really not good, though it seems that Buckingham tried to rescue it with his production.  When I See You Again is a song that had some potential but seems unorganized, slow, and just poorly thought out.  Once again Nicks' voice also undermines the song.    The problem here may have been that Nicks really forced these contributions onto the album very late in the game.  They're not horrible tracks but they do show how much Nicks' contributions had fallen off for Fleetwood Mac since Tusk.    Still a good album, but definitely the worst classic Fleetwood Mac lineup album due to Nicks' subpar showing here.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|In case there is anyone on the planet who hasn't before recognized the talent of George Harrison, there is so much love and good music on this DVD that will keep you singing, smiling, and maybe crying many times over.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|This CD was actually recommended to me by a friend and I'm an eclectic music listener..if you look at my ipod..my music tastes range from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Interpol, Nirvana, Radiohead, to Usher, Kanye West..to Faith Hill and Leanne Rimes, Rachael Yamagata and Sara Bareilles.  Needless to say, I'm not a music snob and I know what I like..and Paramore tops my list!  I love every song in this CD!
0679721037|4.0|My daughter is reading it for a 9th grade class.  I skimmed through looking for the telltale signs of Modern Liberal indoctrination. Unlike her Human Geography book, which is loaded with Socialist thinking, this book is genuine in following several characters as they dealt with their lives after the destruction.    As some other readers pointed out (I didn't read every review), Hersey doesn't dwell on the moral issues.  It's a genuine look at the characters.  It's written in a rather dry style that lets the characters stories speak for themselves and allows the reader to form his or her own conclusions.    (Now, if this book was written today or maybe by someone else, I wouldn't be surprised if the book was more of anti-war/anti-human tome that is typical of today's Modern Liberals.  I'm talking about the now-normal attacks on Western Civilization, American exceptionalism, Conservatism, Bush, etc.  I wouldn't be surprised if they found a way to say Halliburton was involved in the building of the bomb or that one of Cheney's uncles was key.  If you want to learn about Modern Liberals, watch the video at YouTube called \\"How Modern Liberals Think\\" by Evan Sayet. As Amazon pulls urls off these reviews, just go to YouTube and search on \\"Evan Sayet\\" and pick the \\"How Modern Liberals Think\\" video.)     Anyways, if you want a book on the human aspects of some of the people bombed, then you may enjoy this book.  Just remember, the alternative to bombing was many more deaths.
B000127LW2|4.0|I love this show and the imaginitive writing but the first season was off to a rough start.  It's almost like it was setting up the subsequent seasons storywise.  But it's still worthwhile overall if you intend to keep watching.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|For those who want to relive an incredible Broadway show experience, this is the CD to do it with. And definitely much cheaper than what they sell at the show for!
B000ZINGIK|5.0|Haunting lyrics, windswept chorus, power vocals with exceeding clearness and talents from many sources woven beautifully together.  Tobias Sammet is a genius that defies the age that he is born into.  If you love power, melodic metal that blows away classical opera with its story telling and soulful exposure to your deepest center, buy the scarecrow by Avantasia.
B0018CA996|3.0|There are 2 tracks I really like on their new work.  The song \\"Hunter\\" has the most going on musically, very smooth music.  The \\"Rip\\" is also good because it builds on some good lyrics and continues to build with actual beats and rhythm.    If you are expecting this to be anything like the old Portishead it's not.  I would have to label it more experimental at this point.  There are many songs like, \\"Machine Gun\\" that takes the same 7 second sample and loops it for 4 minutes while the singer tries to put a melody over it. There are many songs just like this, they don't really build towards anything or have a structure.    Is the song \\"Magic Doors\\" an accidental rip off of the Bjork song \\"I have seen it all\\" because it carries the same exact melody as her chorus.  You can hear it in the samples on Amazon if you search for it.      Even after repeat listening sessions, the album as a whole is interesting and makes me hope they put out more work.    This is something only the diehard Portishead fans will love.  The ones who don't care if they played one note on a keyboard for 6 minutes while the singer did her thing.    There are a few songs that are worth individual download, but I can't recommend this album beyond that.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is just an amazing documentary and I really wonder how much effort would have gone in making it. Its a must have in any nature lover's collection and a must watch (at least once) for everyone else.   The commentary by David Attenborough is a little dull and boring but the imagery more than makes up for it. Probably the commentary on the discovery version is better but it is encoded in 1080i, so if you have a 1080p TV definitely go for the BBC version.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This is a fantastic film, a sort of study on the character defects we all possess.  The dark side of humanity exposed, flaws illuminated like skin under florescent lighting.  Faith tested and put under scrutiny and later proven.  Tough questions asked but never answered.  Egos bashed and bruised.  Boys turned into men, unwillingly.  These are some of the topics covered in \\"There Will Be Blood\\", subtle and sometimes blatant, it sneaks into your brain like a slow poison.  \\"There Will be Blood\\" is old school cinema.  It's not brainless violence, super hero melodrama.  It's storytelling and character driven.  The score is fantastic as well, casting a sureal vibe to a story that is as old as time, ego and greed.
0316067598|5.0|While reading this book, I felt I was Marc Lutrell and it was me going through SEAL training and fighting along side Axe, Mikey and Danny. Thats how well this book is written. It was an educational, exciting,  painfully realistic, humorous and exhilerating read. This book will wake you up! It opens your eyes about the damage that liberal know nothing media, lawyers and politicians do to our military and war fighting capabilities. This is not a read, it is an experience.

B00151G08Y|5.0|Wow, lots of haters around here.    Quite a bit of a stylistic change from Hold Your Colour, but with the same unique Pendulum sound (especially that snare, kick, and bass.) Can't really be classified as \\"drum and bass\\" anymore, as it seems that Pendulum has decided to develop a more commercially appealing sound. It will be interesting to see how many copycat bands this album spawns.    Overall, the album is superb. From top to bottom you can detect the amount of time and work put into the production and mixing, creating lush textures that define how electronics can be used to take songs to the next level.    My one minor gripe is that I would have loved to see another chill track such as the epic \\"9000 Miles.\\" Other standouts are Showdown, Propane Nightmares, Mutiny, The Tempest, and Granite.
B000P46QIG|1.0|Amazon deleted my previous review on this album. No matter. I decided to give these guys another try to see if they would grow on me. They didn't. I can't get past the first minute of each track before I skip to the next one. I agree with another reviewer who said something like it was just a scrambled mess. The artwork is the best thing on the album.<br /><br />It sounds like they recorded this album in seperate studios, not even listening to what the other member was playing, and then tried to make it fit together. It just didn't work at all. I was a fan of Derek when he was in [[ASIN:B000002HPT Dream Theater]], so I had high expectations from him here. I can see why they got rid of him for Jordan. His solos sound drunk and everything else sounds like synth from a casio.<br /><br />I hope their other albums are better than this. From the samples I heard on Amazon they don't sound any different. Please Derek, go sell used cars or host a radio show. You certainly can't pick band members to play with.
0316010669|5.0|Here the author of the groundbreaking, \\"The Tipping Point,\\" has again \\"tapped into\\" an underlying human ability of the mind to do amazing things, that upon first impressions appears all but impossible -- or at the very least, highly improbable. This book is filled with anecdotes (from the arts, psychology, statistics,  business, and everyday life) of \\"analyses at a glimpse\\" (that the author refers to as \\"thin slicing\\"), which turn out to be almost as good as detailed, longer-term, more in depth analyses.<br /><br />This human ability to perform instantaneous \\"background mental processing\\" is presented here as if it is not just special, but also uncanny and even mysterious, and indeed it is. More appropriately, it is human pattern recognition analysis, an acutely human ability which has evolved in man over eons and in parallel with his ability to reason and to become conscious of his own actions, and thus to be able \\"to preview\\" things in his conscious environment before they happen. As a result of \\"being conscious\\", the human brain has had to learn to process prodigious amounts of information at the subconscious level in the background.<br /><br />One of the most obvious of these abilities (of these formidable background calculations) is the ability of humans to recognize each other by facial characteristics, which although we humans take it for granted, as a formal scientific process, is exceedingly difficult. Scientists have discovered, for instance, that babies as young as only a few days old can distinguish between their parents and others. So, clearly, this ability must have tremendous survival value.<br /><br />But also, if one remembers some of Picasso's \\"minimalist sketches,\\" of Shakespeare, (and there are equally famous computer-generated ones of Einstein and Abe Lincoln, and Marilyn Monroe, in addition to the famous bard) traced out of no more than five or six disconnected lines, the image of these famous icons emerge with unexpected but unmistakable clarity. Picasso, obviously is using the brain of a highly sensitive master artist; in the latter case, the computers are using \\"computer generated algorithms,\\" which by all calculations, is a crude approximation to what Picasso does. Those who have studied pattern recognition analysis and are already familiar with these minimalist iconic images know that they are the result of sophisticated data compression techniques (mostly complexly manipulated Fourier Transforms coupled with other information reduction algorithms). They also know how difficult it is to create algorithms to reproduce these precise images as a formal scientific process.<br /><br />In my own work many years ago at the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), among other problems, I used similar data compression techniques to distinguish between the seismic signatures of earthquakes and nuclear explosions. The objective of course was to develop an algorithm (or a set of algorithms) that preserved the maximum amount of discriminatory information that could be used to separate the signatures of the two phenomena with a high degree of reliability, and of course using the minimum amount of information.  In most cases, algorithms that even approach the skill of humans at recognizing such patterns, to the extent they exist at all, are very, very complex indeed.<br /><br />Thus, as was the case with \\"The Tipping Point\\" (in which non-linear processes having points of discontinuities readily explained by Rene Thom's Calculus of Catastrophe Theory), again it seems that the mystery here, can also be explained thorough the formal scientific process of \\"Pattern Recognition Analysis.\\"<br /><br />But this revelation of the mystery makes this book no less interesting or less important. Again, Gladwell is on to something. Five Stars
0767817478|4.0|It's one of my son's favorite movies. We've worn out the video tape, destroyed a disc and absolutely had to have another one.  We've already watched it 5 times since it arrived a month ago. I'm more of \\"The Hours\\" type of movie watcher, but I love watching this one with my son.  Action, monsters, chases, and pyrotechnics--it has it all. Oh yeah--- it's also a love story. Like I said, it has it all.
0767834739|4.0|The movie itself is good, but the to see a zombified children in school was not good.
044661758X|5.0|Michael Connelly has written a lot of Bosch novels, and Concrete Blonde is one of the earliest. For a novel written in 1994, it is still every bit as good as the more recent Connelly novels. In THE CONCRETE BLONDE, Bosch is on trial for killing Norman Church four years ago. The police, press and Bosch believe Church was a serial killer known as the Dollmaker. His widow is suing Bosch for using improper force in killing her husband. As the trial begins, Bosch receives a note identical to the ones the Dollmaker used to right. The note led them to another victim. The victim was killed in the exact manner as the Dollmaker's victims. Bosch is stunned. The Dollmaker was killed four years ago. Who could be sending the note?<br /><br />Bosch quickly develops a theory and a task force is developed to find what the police believe is a copycat killer. Much of the novel revolves around the trial, and the rest follows Bosch as he tries to formulate leads on new suspects.<br /><br />I loved this novel because it is as good as anything new I've read. Connelly has been good from day one. In THE CONCRETE BLOND, Bosch struggles to keep the relationship with his girlfriend going, and encounters some of the most tormented, demented suspects yet. This is a must read for Bosch fans.
0679805273|5.0|I have to say, who doesn't love Dr. Seuss?  My daughter is graduating high school this year...she is going on to be a teacher and in her high school years she has been involved in RIF (Reading is Fundamental) and has \\"taught\\" at a local preschool during school class hours.  She loves to read to \\"her kids\\" and Dr. Seuss is always a favorite.  I didn't THINK of this as a Graduation gift, but saw that someone else did and I thought it's the PERFECT gift for her.  She loves Dr. Seuss and she loves to read to her kids...this book says it all to her...Oh, the Places You'll Go.  I love her so much and don't know what I'll do without her, but...she will go places...she has brains in her head and feet in her shoes...HAPPY GRADUATION BABY.

B0014YVC6W|1.0|This is not a review of the blu-ray version. I am afraid to spend money on it since it appears to have the same major failing as the DVD version (which I do have)--NO CAPTIONS. I assume that captions are not too costly or difficult since every DVD I own has them. There are several reasons why captions are helpful which I won't labor over, but I think every blu-ray should have captions and a wealth of other extras. My blu-ray player uploads my DVD's so well that I see no reason to upgrade my collection from DVDs to blu-rays unless there is offered something beyond what the DVDs have. FUN MOVIE--worthy of more stars, but blu-ray without captions is unacceptable.
B0010X745K|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie. I loved the short story and loved Darabont's other King films.   However, this movie was a horrible dissapointment. It boils down to 25% monster movie and 75% thinly veiled rant against the evils of Christianity. The monster of the film is not actually the monsters, but the crazy Christian lady: because all Christians are crazy and just this far from being Jim Jones- a comparison actually made in the film. I know that Hollywood is never the least bit respectful of the Christian faith, but to compare its members to a monster like Jim Jones is very bad form. Of course, if you aren't Christian, or if you have no respect for other people's religions, then it may not bother you at all. I am, obviously, a Christian, and I even have a VERY thick skin when it comes to my religion in popular media, but this was just ridiculous.  To further ruin the film is its utterly predictable ending. If you can't see that one coming, you are no fan of the genre.  A bad movie. Just very disrespectful and well worth missing. Check out 1408 if you want to see an excellent film based on King's work-- or one of Darabont's others (Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption).
B0013FXWU6|4.0|I loved this movie and that's why I purchased it but it didn't come in a plastic DVD holder. Instead it came it a printed cardboard envelope which is not as durable over time.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I love this DVD.  I had it first on VHS when it first came out and it helped get in shape when I was 18 and trying to get into the Air Force.  10 years later this is the video that is getting me in shape after having my son.  This is a great workout to build your strength and get nice muscle tone esp. in your arms legs and thighs.  I do it all the time and recently bought it for my younger cousin who also feel in love with it.  This is a def. must have for anyone who wants to get in shape and build strengh too. It has workouts for EVERY body part.  Arms, legs, chest, abs and even your back.  But don't take my word for it...buy it and see for yourself, you won't regret it.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|This movie is somewhat entertaining, but sporatic in it's storyline and pretty bland in the romance department.  And what's all the hullabaloo about Daniel Craig's nude scene?  There IS NONE.  Even the sex scenes are totally G rated.  Pretty dull.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am very happy and impressed with this video.  I have only had the video for a week but I am loving it!  I am a 30 y/o in relatively good shape and this workout makes you sweat!  If you are like me and looking for an at home challenging workout, then this is the one that delivers.  I also really like how Jillian incorporates the strength, cardio, and abs all into one workout.  I workout 4-5 days a week and this is day 5 of using this video and I am not up to workout #3 yet. (she has 3 different levels)  I really like that she gives you something to work up to!  If your looking for a challenge and something to give you real results then this is the one.
B00004RF97|3.0|I really didn't see what made this such a \\"great\\" film.  It was not bad and somewhat entertaining.  However, it was, in my opinion, no greater than many other romantic comedies of that era. I actually fell asleep on it twice.
0634022296|5.0|The title of this book says it all...Complete Chord Songbook. If you love the Beatles and aspire to play their music on the guitar, I would highly recommend this book to you.  If you know basic chords, you will be able to play many of the songs as soon as you pick it up.  If not, each song has chord diagrams so you can easily figure them out. I can't speak for the professional musician, but if you want to play the Beatles, this is the only book you need to purchase.
0307387178|3.0|Though this Jon Krakauer effort is not as thrilling as INTO THIN AIR, it had its moments.  Nature lovers and literature lovers alike will find something to admire in the restless young soul of Chris McCandless.  There's plenty of description of God's Country (Alaska, to us) and of Chris's tastes in authors (Thoreau and Tolstoy figure prominently).  The problem is, at times we lose track of McCandless as Kraukauer gets sidetracked with storylines about other restless seekers from history who misjudged the wild and either lived to regret it or regretted to die because of it.  While somewhat interesting, these chapters break the narrative arc as well as the interest built in McCandless as a protagonist.<br /><br />The story of McCandless was originally an article Krakauer penned for OUTSIDE MAGAZINE.  Transforming it into a full-fledged book required not only the historical asides mentioned above, but even an autobiographical chapter about Krakauer himself (the author justifying it by a similar experience he had while climbing a mountain in his rash youth). If you read the magazine article and craved more details, you'll be treated to some updated theories on McCandless's demise.  If the \\"padding\\" distracts you, however, skip those chapters that experience their own \\"wanderlust\\" and stick to the chapters about the protagonist.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|If you love the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice, don't watch this adaptation, if you love the Book don't watch this adaptation.  The Characters aren't believable as the people they portray.  It's like watching the Gwyneth Paltrow version of Emma... much to Hollywood for me.
B0010X73ZG|2.0|I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE.      I HAVE LONG CONSIDERED THIS STORY ONE OF KING'S BEST AND WONDERED WHY NO ONE PUT IT ON SCREEN BEFORE.  THE MOVIE IS GENERALLY TRUE TO THE NOVELLA BUT AT THE SAME TIME MISSES THE HEART OF THE STORY. WHICH IS THE MAIN CHARACTERS CARE OF AND LOVE FOR HIS SON, WHILE ALL THE HORROR OF THE STORY UNFOLDS.     THE DIRECTOR SHOULD HAVE STAYED TRUE TO THE KING STORY.  HE INVENTS SOME SCENES WASTING TIME THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO FLESH OUT THE STORY AS KING WROTE IT.     FINALLY THE DIRECTOR CHANGES KINGS MORE AMBIGIOUS BUT HOPEFUL END FOR ONE OF HIS OWN THAT IS HOPELESS. YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE ENDING ALONE MR DIRECTOR. UP TO THAT POINT THE MOVIE WASN'T BAD JUST FLAWED.  I HOPE SOMEONE TAKES ANOTHER CRACK AT THE STORY SOMETIME AND DOES IT RIGHT. MEANING DON'T REWRITE STEVEN KING.     I WISH THE DIRECTOR HAD FILMED TWO ENDINGS TO THE MOVIE HIS OWN AND THE ONE KING WROTE.  THAT WAY THE DVD COULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED WITH BOTH. THE VIEWER COULD CHOOSE TO VIEW THE MOVIE WITH THE ENDING THAT WAS TRUE TO KING INSTEAD OF THE DIRECTORS. THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIED A MUCH MORE SATISFYING MOVIE.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|and I really enjoyed her previous works, more than I could have ever imagined, but this record is horrible.  The songs are trite, the lyrics are incredibly boring, indulgent and immature.  The music is pop staple, with forgetable melodies and repetative chorus lines, I feel as if the studio wrote the entire album for her while she was sleeping, this just doesn't speak to any of her previous works at all.  This album fits on the same shelf with a Nickelodeon-themed CD.  Instead of heading in the direction of an artist like Alanis Morrisette, she is going backward and joining the ranks of Hannah Montana and the Naked Brothers Band.  She is a great artist and her first two records are amazing.  She is better than this CD and I am looking forward to her next effort.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|What a Great double-cd set.  I bought this on the strength of the \\"I Don't Want to Write You A Love Song\\" single and was pleasantly surprised by Sara's voice range and songwriting ability.  She's got a great voice and BOTH discs are still in my CD changer!
B0007939NO|5.0|This product arrived very quickly and was just what I expected.  I've been looking for this classic on DVD.  I'm glad I found it on Amazon.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Most gay movies are low budget and cheesy.  This movie has great actors, gream film technique, a good screen play, a compelling plot, interesting characters, beautiful scenery, and leaves you feeling moved and challenged at the end.  I'm glad I live in one of the cities where it is showing in theaters because I plan to go watch it again in a few days.  I'm a bartender at a gay bar and asked many of my customers if they have ever seen a better gay movie. Everyone who has seen it said that nothing they have seen in the gay genre is as good.  Highly recommended!
B000Y35A94|5.0|The long awaited release of the live DVD \\"When In Rome\\" has been reported to be May 27th in the states, and if you go onto the official Genesis site, they have it for pre-order as the release date being June 10th. It's to be a 3-DVD set. 2 DVD's for the complete concert with tons of extras, and the 3rd DVD being a documentary of the tour being planned and executed. I hope that this settles everyone's interest in the DVD release. I am eagerly awaiting my copy to be delivered!!

B0013UN9DQ|5.0|If you are an Air fan like I am and have followed them consistently over the years and have seen them several times live... then I'm sure you already have purchased this item. If you are a new fan you can get just the actual record. If you know Air today it is because of Moon Safari... That's all!
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book, though I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the ending.  It's clear that her life became more important than her writing there.  And that was ok with me.  I cannot get over the people who didn't like the book.  It's her life and her account. Who the hell are they to call her or it vapid.  I'd like to see them write a book.<br />Ok, that's my peace
0810993139|5.0|This was a really good book. It is more for younger kids but even for the older ones (like me, a teen) it gives a lot of laughs. It portrays things that you would think would happen in grade school and puts them in perspective. It does not have a real plot, its just a book for laughs. I love the characters and the illustration. You can tell its from an elemantary school point of view. This book is great so buy it so you can laugh and maybe relive some of your own elementary memories.
B00124DUA0|5.0|...this one is a no brainer, and should be part of your collection.  In my opinion one of the best soundtracks written by John Williams and the additional cues that were missing from the original release of this sountrack alone are enough to add this to your collection!  Highly recommended!!!
080701429X|5.0|This book gives you a very powerful insight in the lives of millions that had the opportunity to be prisoners in the concentration camps. As strange as it sounds, that was an opportunity to develop their love for life, and that love for life was what kept them alive, Victor Frankl is a being full of light that not only thought about his own life but the value of other's lives, specially in such an ultimate experience where survival was critical. You will love it and is such a small book that gives you so much that is incredible that so much light could be put in to such a small book.
B00192IOBA|5.0|This is honestly his best work to date. If you like any music at all I recomend this to anyone and you will not be disapointed. I bought this album in MP3 format yesterday and then went out and bought the CD locally for my friends and family. This is a must for any music collection.
0783227434|5.0|This, the best & third entry in the Evil Dead series, is an absolute blast! It's funny, exciting, scary, well acted, beautifully designed and choreographed, and, most of all, imaginative to the extreme!     Bruce Campbell is fantastic here (as usual), but here he's really allowed to excercise his funny bone, and man does he stretch (in more ways than one). You'll be laughing and cheering along with him the whole way through!     As for plot: Ash, our scrappy hero from the first two Evil Dead movies, is sucked through a dimensional vortex thingy (courtesy of Necronomicon, the demonic book of the dead) and finds himself lost in time...the middle ages, more specifically. Before you know it, he finds himself saving the kingdom and setting things right when the Necronomicon's evil minions, the army of darkness of the movies title, start causing trouble. Epic, silly gold!

0446577391|5.0|[[ASIN:1424172705 Fete of Death]]  \\"Stone Cold\\" is a fast-paced conspiracy thriller starring the shadowy CIA hit man Oliver Stone, not to be confused with the eponymous conspiracy-minded movie director of \\"JFK.\\"  Men involved in Stone's unsavory and violent past are being picked off by a ruthless assassin.<br /><br />Stone, with good reason, begins to fear for his own life.  It is obvious to him that someone out there, most likely a member of Washington's powerful elite who has a dark secret to hide, wants Stone and his former operatives dead.  The only certain way to protect this secret is by eliminating Stone and his cronies who are in the loop.<br /><br />The story moves at a brisk pace and hurtles forward courtesy of plot twists and a plethora of action.  I myself haven't read Baldacci's Oliver Stone prequel \\"The Camel Club,\\" but I found reading it isn't necessary to enjoying or understanding \\"Stone Cold.\\"  I did read \\"Hour Game,\\" an earlier thriller sans Oliver Stone by Baldacci, and, for my money, \\"Stone Cold\\" is an improvement, both in its pacing and story line.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I never thought I'd say this, but this is the worst dance album I've ever heard in years and, unfortunately, it was released by Madonna.<br /><br />From start to finish, the album is just awlful.  The lyrics are lame and the production is just so empty for a dance album.  This is the first thing I've ever listened to by this TImberland (I'm more into rock now vs. pop/dance since most of it has been total garbage since the late 90's)--if this is the type of junk that is on the radio, then I can see why the music industry is suffering and major labels are crumbling!!<br /><br />TImberland's beats are so outdated--it's as if he went to a yard sale, picked up some forgotten disco LPs and mixed them up behind the now DELERIOUS Madonna-who has either ran out of steam to put out quality material or, out of desperation to be \\"hip\\" with the kids, made an album with this fool along with duets with Justin Timberlake (which, though is the only good song on the cd--but the good version is found on the remix single-the album version is so boring, it becomes and LONG 4 minutes) and this Kayne West person.<br /><br />I though COnfessions of the Dance Floor was bad, but this is just junk.  I kept skimming thru the cd to find a diamond in the rough, but came up short handed.<br /><br />This HARD CANDY is hard to swallow and stale.  Madonna, go back to working with the producers that did Ray of Light and American Life and do things YOUR WAY and stop trying to follow trends to act young--Don't let yourself become the fallen leader of Dance Music!
B00192IOBA|5.0|fantastic! If your tired of the overproduced albums like i am this is a breath of fresh air. This is Jason Mraz's best studio release you will not be disappointed. Great guest artists colbie caillat and james morrison both released their first album last year and both duets with jason are amazing. If you have had the pleasure of getting some of jason's live recordings this is the same calibur. After mr. az I'm glad to see jason doing what he does best lyrically driven songs while giving toca rivera tracks to shine with his great harmonies and great alt percussion.  Jason Mraz vocally is one of the best in popular music and this album highlights this by not drowning it out making it radio friendly. This cd will be playing in my cd player for years to come.
B00132D808|5.0|I know that this album is pretty unexpected for all you hardcore Panic fans...but it's fan-frickin-tastic!  It's got a kind of retro feel.  The guitar riffs are extremely catchy and the horn section fits quite nicely.  It's very Beatles-esque.  I have been a fan of Panic for a long time and even though in this album they divert from their signature style, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised :)
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout video.  I've been doing it for about 6 weeks, alternating between Levels 1,2,and 3. I'm getting much stronger, firmer, and it only takes about 25 minutes a day.  It's challenging at any level, and is easily modified for beginner to advanced fitness levels.  Way to go, Jillian!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best work out DVD I have ever owned!! I am really un-coordinated and not able to do any DVDs with complicated moves or dancing....this DVD has NONE of that!! We are talking Jumping Jacks, Push ups, sit ups, squats, etc....  Nothing to have you rewinding the DVD to figure out what the heck is going on.     Oh yeah...and she kicks your a$$ too!!
0061245097|4.0|Keep in mind I am not a  big Vampire Fiction fan...  Still I loved Halfway to the Grave and eagerly anticipated this follow-up.  The first several chapters were a bit dreary for me, probably because Bones took a while to make an entrance.  Once he showed up, the story took off.  He and Cat still have great chemistry and a wonderful relationship. Their interactions are very entertaining and the plot is full of action.      For some reason, I found the gruesome elements of the story more bothersome this time around. Frost does a very good job not dwelling on  gore and violence for the most part, but even her matter of fact, quick moving prose couldn't quite make me read a couple of descriptions.  At one point, I skipped almost an entire scene because I found the activity so repulsive.  As I was thumbing through, I caught a sentence about two people vomiting from what they were witnessing which made me happy with my choice to breeze past that bit.      So I can't give this book the same 5 star rating as I did Frost's first installment.  Still, it was a fun, interesting read with lots of excitement and good character development.  I look forward to Cat and Bones' next appearance -- gore and blood not withstanding.
0743437497|5.0|[[ASIN:0615173926 Six Chilling Nightmares]]  The most evil book that is on the market is the shining. I have read this book several times and have bought and read most of Stephen King books. Insanity is lurking in everybody waiting to be released. I am delighted to have experienced a true feeling of hopelessness and was sad when the cook was axed. Hurry up and die, take a flight rent a snowcap, and be blind-sided by a lunatic. This book is about insanity and terror written to chill you to the bone. In the cold mountains of Colorado that will never be forgotten, a chilling story. The Shining is in a league of its own a step above and beyond any book of its kind. \\"All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.\\" The last thing that Jack was is dull in the Shining; Jack was insane. An outstanding plot and a perfect ending for the Shining.

B000VI70WM|5.0|This album is as close as you can get to the original Duran2 without re-recording the 1st two albums. It brings back the melodic sense as well as the club-catered groove. Arguably their best overall effort alongside Rio and Medazzaland. Hopefully it won't be their last. Btw- see the tour at all costs. The bonus track available on the UK version is as good as any track here, so find it if you can.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Iron Maiden gives us an amazing album. This is Iron Maiden essence: creative, powerful, heavy, and with intelligent lyrics. I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of them, I have always listened the \\"holy trinity\\" of classic Maiden (The Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, Powerslave), but I must admit that \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" catched me as one more \\"trooper\\", is a great heavy metal album with strong progressive influence. Some people are saying that is not classic Maiden but that is not true: all the songs have the \\"classic Maiden\\" ingredients and you will not get tired of listen the album again and again.   All the performances are outstanding, they are without any doubt very talented musicians, but I think Dickinson is out of this world in this album, he is singing better than ever. After this masterpiece, what can we expect from Iron Maiden?

B000VDDWDS|5.0|Master And Commander won two Oscar's for its great sound editing and another for cinematography and was nominated for several more including best sound mixing and visual effects in 2004 and there has never been a better way to enjoy it with this release,the standard dvd had great sound to begin with but this is a much higher level.The picture quality is pretty good as well,I'll have to agree and disagree with other reviewers here.Yes Fox most recent blu's have had pretty bad picture quality(AVP2,Hitman,Predator)even Independence Day was a disapointment but having said that there is nothing wrong with the picture with Master and Commander,at times its as good as anything out.I think it has to do alot with the color the film was shot and the general fim source whenever it doesn't look its best.As I look at it right now a scene in the ship within the first 30min.were the two young shipmates bring a model of the enemy ship to the captain I though wow thats as good as anything I got on Blu.Yes the special features are bare but there are two pretty cool things.First there is a map you can look at anytime in the film to see the ship's position relative to the world and second and really good fact track that runs during the film.I'm not big on special features anymore I look more for performance on Blu Ray and this has it with both Audio and Video,finally Fox put out a good one,now they just to work on price's and we'll be ok.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I requested this for my anniversary. I have to say WOW! Can I just say that Josh really enjoyed himself. He was rockin' it out to many of the up beat songs. You can finally see that he was in his element and the music was exactly what he wanted to write and he felt every bit of it. So did I! Tariq Akoni tore up that electric guitar and the bassist was so good. Ok, I had to rewind this next part. Lucia Micarelli killed it! I mean, she gave me goosebumps. I can't tell you anymore...ok, I will. It was crazy!!! That girl is rock to the core. The celloist that accompanied her was excellent. You'd never think these instruments could be so raw but this showed me another side of it. I really enjoyed this DVD. I was eating while I watched it and stopped chewing (and sometime's breathing) a couple of times. What a great escape from the outside world. Exactly what music should do for you. Josh was on point with all his notes and his sound was never better! I just love Machine and Weeping. He was having a blast and always so kind, earthy and genuine. Never conceited or too good for the crowd. An he could be if he wanted to with all that raw talent! I love that! Love Josh and his band forever! Check out Michael Buble's Caught in the Act DVD. Amazing!!! I get to see it again with my girlfriend tomorrow. I urge all of you to buy this DVD. You will not be sorry. What you gain in an hour and a half is better than anything you can go see in the movies or on television. Stimulate your brain cells, people!!! I love all the instruments they use. This is excellent to stimulate children to want to take up an instrument. Ok, enough from me. P.S. My hubby shed a tear to Lullaby. I think I have got him where I want him! Another convert!!!
0743201140|4.0|A key value and purpose of this book is to link you to a web site to take the StrengthFinder survey. The code in the back cover can only be used once, so if you buy a used copy, that has probably already been consumed.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I just watched this film. I know this is going to sound harsh, but it was so bad I had to write a review about it tonight. At first I was like no way, please don't tell me this is a Blare Witch Rip (film documented from person holding the camera and leaves the viewer believing the film will get better throughout, but does not). Well at least it was in color.  Negatives:   1) Hudd the individual shooting the film was an annoying character  2)You dont get to know the characters in the film long enough to really care about them  3) Film was shot in  first person and it made me feel that if I had friends that were gifted in special effects it wouldn't take much to make this film(subjective opinion)  4)No real ending, and because the viewer did not get to know the characters the irony doesn't mean very much  5)Overall a fake out viewer waits for the film to get better and there are a few fake outs but it does not. It leaves the viewer disappointed until the credits roll  Positives:   1)The chaos is realistic   2)The irony of how the film was shot over a previous tape  3)The idea onwhich the film was based has potential. If remade with a real ending, better writing, and some serious editing it could actually be decent.  -Also I am not in the movie industry nor do I aspire to be, I just like good movies

B000VDDWDS|5.0|I do not care for anything \\"extra\\" in my movie watching so I do not relate to anybody complaining about the lack of extras. I can say that viewing this (rented from Netflix) yesterday on my 60\\" Sony SXRD XBR1 (even with a faulty OB) with my Samsung BD-P1400 bitstreaming DTS-HD MA to my Onkyo 805, I was transported into the Surprise.

B000OHZJKK|5.0|This Year's Model was Elvis Costello's second album and his first with the Attractions. Mr. Costello embodied the angry attitude of punk rock, but unlike most punk bands who were unskilled musicians that thrived on high energy, he possessed a rapier pen and an ear for melody. The album opens with the fierce \\"No Action\\" that in fine punk form clocks in at less than two minutes. \\"This Year's Girl\\" is wry take on the fame machine. \\"The Beat\\" has a catchy organ riff and is about the tried and true subject of self-gratification. \\"Pump It Up\\" is a fiery track as is \\"Lip Service\\". \\"(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea\\" has a manic verve while \\"Little Triggers\\" slows things down. \\"Radio Radio\\" is the most famous off the album, but the album's best track is \\"Lipstick Vogue\\". The song has a thumping bass line that shuffles along until a frenzied close. This Year's Model gave further proof that Elvis Costello may well be the king.

B0018RBN8C|3.0|The fictional biography that the marketing groups created for this girl (\\"growing up in isolation listening to old records\\") did not really take hold in the U.S. for this foreign (American Idol-type) contest runner-up. This is actually Aimée Duffy's second album, produced to sound a bit like Amy Winehouse-lite. But the vocals are a little summery thin and one-dimensional, closer to Norah Jones than Amy Winehouse or even newcomer Adele. The album is just okay. Worth a listen for $6.99 but not much more.

B00005JPNY|2.0|The book is brilliantly written and much more complex than the movie. Of course a 400 page novel can never really condense into a 2 hour movie successfully but in the case of this film, they should have hired a real writer and a non-American director to do it correctly. The \\"writer/director\\" responsible for this mess should never be allowed near a film set again. He was just not intelligent enough to comprehend and distill the material, so instead of an interesting and new work of art we get a lightening-paced mess of superficial action highlights. This is not so much a film as it is a poorly constructed (albeit very long) trailer for a much more complicated and rich story. It isn't that scenes have been removed or changed or seem missing somehow (which is expected in any book-to-film adaptation) but whole layers of thematic nuance and subtext and nowhere to be found. Shakespeare for kindergarteners. It is as if the producers and \\"writer/director\\" found a diamond and were not smart enough to even recognize what they held in their hands, passing it back and forth until all they had were a few grains of shiny sand that no longer held value or even together. Are there no intelligent people left in Hollywood? Surely someone must have seen the script or an early cut of the \\"film\\" and noticed that something was terribly wrong. Did no one even talk to the author (or even Peter Hedges) before the film was in production? What an absolute WASTE of brilliant source material!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|It took fifty-three for Casino Royale to make its way to the big screen (not counting a 1954 TV film and 1967 spoof) and it now seems both fitting and ironic that the first, and arguably best, Bond novel should serve as the first Bond film of Daniel Craig. Even more ironic is the fact that one of the best Bond novels has lead to the best Bond film yet. That fact though, is just the icing on the cake for what looks to be the new beginning of 007.<br /><br />Daniel Craig's debut as Bond is nothing short of stunning. Many wondered if this blond actor better known for his more serious acting roles could be an action hero. The answer: a definite yes. Craig brings a physical magnetism to the part of Bond missing really since the early Sean Connery films and he is believable in all of the films action sequences. But what really sells Craig is his acting abilities. Craig brings a very serious approach to Bond. He is everything Bond should be: cold, ruthless, and capable of being a human being. And when it comes to humor, which a lot of fans were worried about, Craig is just as adept. Any doubts about Craig as Bond, they should be taken away at the very end of the film where Craig gets to say \\"The name's Bond James Bond\\" for the first time. Craig is the best Bond since Timothy Dalton and arguably he has even surpassed Dalton.<br /><br />Eva Green plays Vesper Lynd, the representative from the MI6 sent with Bond on his first major mission as a 00 agent. Green brings a considerable amount of acting ability to this role and she is far from your average Bond girl. While beautiful and truly stunning physically, Green is an actress and she gets to prove it more then really any other Bond girl. Green is truly an amazing Bond girl and a welcomed relief to the stereotypically cardboard Bond girls.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelsen, a relatively unknown Dannish actor, makes an impressive Le Chiffre. Bond villains generally lack either believability or acting ability, especially since in Die Another Day. But there we get arguably the best Bond villain of the series to date. Le Chiffre is a villain, he is after all the man who serves as financier to the world's terrorists. Yet there is a surprising amount of humanity in him. He deformed eye that weeps tears of blood and his sense of both menace and humor make him the most three-dimensional Bond villain and even at times sympathetic. Mikkelson is the new face of Bond villains.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also great. Judi Dench returns as M, the head of MI6. Her scenes with Craig have a sense of menace to them that surpasses similar scenes with Pierce Brosnan. Dench had more or less inhabited the role of M since Goldeneye but in this film she once again makes the role her own. Jeffrey Wright makes a brief, but welcomed appearance as CIA agent Felix Lieter and we can only hope we see more of him in future films. Caterina Murno seems to be little more then window dressing as Solange, a girlfriend of one of the villains, but she leaves one wishing we'd seen more of her in this film.<br /><br />The script is also perhaps the best to be written for a Bond film. Based on the novel by Fleming, the films plot is an update of the plot of Fleming's novel. The plot is realistic and the lack of gadgets doesn't hurt the film at all. The love story, the first in a while, is a nice addition to the film. The lines are well written and time is taken to actually develop the plot to its fullest and Fleming would be, in my opinion, proud of this film adaptation.<br /><br />The action sequences of this film are stunning. From the gritty black and white fight in the opening teaser sequence the to the running sequence in Madagascar to the attempted bombing of Miami international airport to the stairwell fight and the gunfight in the falling house in Venice at the end, the action sequences have a sense of realism missing from many of the Bond films.<br /><br />Campbell, who directed Brosnan's debut in Goldeneye, does anotherstunning job in this film. Working with cinematographer Phil Meheux (who also did Goldeneye) and editor Stuart Baird, Campbell created a visual style that brings a new sense of style to the series. From the excellently done black and white teaser detailing how Bond got his 00 number, to the shaky hand held sequence during which Bond is poisoned, and the darkness and shadows in the brilliantly done torture sequence, there is a sense of realism. The sets and costumes also help thanks to production designer Peter Lamont and costume designer Lindy Hemming.<br /><br />The music score by David Arnold is the icing on the cake.

From the excellently done black and white teaser detailing how Bond got his 00 number, to the shaky hand held sequence during which Bond is poisoned, and the darkness and shadows in the brilliantly done torture sequence, there is a sense of realism. The sets and costumes also help thanks to production designer Peter Lamont and costume designer Lindy Hemming.    The music score by David Arnold is the icing on the cake.

B000024C7W|5.0|Stevie Wonder released his album in 1979. It's a beautiful homage to plants. The coolest funkiest song is called \\"Race Babbling\\" where Stevie emulates the voices of the plants. In the song, the plants put a call to help them help us:  \\"Help me people  Save you people  God's induction  Life's construction  These instruct  Will save every living thing  Can't you see that  Life's connected  You need us to live  Both we don't need you\\"    I hope you'll get it for your collection. And dance like crazy to this song!!    Best regards
B000GCFO0I|1.0|In horror movies, there are several different rating factors.  Sadly, the only one this rated highly in is the one you don't want to: the cheese factor.  Mediocre acting, boring and unrealistic special effects, some hard-to-hear (perhaps mercifully) dialogue and over-the-top 'mood music' are enough to render this movie nearly unwatchable.  Plus the overall darkness of most of the scenes (a trend in horror movies these days, I suspect to cut back on special effects budgets) means that even if you watch the movie in the dark you're still squinting at the screen.<br /><br />I found it sadly lacking in plot (okay, it had one, but not a good one - it was trite and recycled) and with almost no suspense to speak of.  I didn't care what happened to the characters.  At one point I was willing to off the main character myself if it'd just stop her shouting.  Of course, this could be because the sound swung wildly from barely audible to bursting your eardrums.  It had a few moments that might have made you jump, were I not overwhelmed with apathy (for instance, the scene with the nurse corpses would have been jumpy, except I spent the time thinking how much it would have improved the movie if they'd busted out into the Thriller song and dance).  It had no lasting, nightmare-giving spook effect (though I admit to being a hard-core horror movie veteran, it would take a lot).<br /><br />I was even willing to give it credit in that it lacked the gratuitous gore that movie-makers now think is a good substitute for real horror, but then the end of the movie was showers of blood and unnecessary gore, which added nothing and took away any brownie points it may have earned in that arena.<br /><br />The only redeeming factor in the entire movie was the very end.  I'll give it a little credit there for not taking the easy route and leaving you with a little lingering air of mystery.  But that wasn't enough to even come close to tipping the scales against the mountain of badness that had accumulated.  Bottom line, on a scale of one to five popcorn bags this movie rates a fossilized chunk of popcorn you find under your couch.e, on a scale of one to five popcorn bags this movie rates a fossilized chunk of popcorn you find under your couch.

0446672653|5.0|Only Love Is Real explores healing through past-life regression, focusing on the role past lives have in current day phobias and issues people expose on their therapists' couch.<br /><br />Weiss shares Pedro's and Elizabeth's sessions of past life regression, revealing they are soulmates who have traumatically lost each other over and over again throughout time.  Weiss shares his techniques and his discovery in this real life love story of two strangers who sought the same psychiatrist for treatment but ended up reuniting with the one soul their souls have subconsciously been searching for.  No telling if this therapy is truly legitimate, but given Weiss following and success, it is surely intriguing and provokes thought on the subject of reincarnation.<br /><br />Only Love Is Real is definitely worth the read for those who've had the \\"I feel like I've known you forever\\" feeling when meeting someone for the first time.
0061537934|5.0|I picked The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein simply because, being a dog lover and seeing the dog on the cover, I couldn't resist.  It was one of those moments, as a reader, you'll remember for a while.  What a wonderful book.<br /><br />Enzo, the narrator, is a dog and Enzo wants nothing more than to be a man.  Here is the only aspect of the book I might doubt.  Anyone who is aware of \\"man's\\" human nature knows that dogs, as a creature, are much nobler.  To become a man might not be an upward move.  Nuff said there.<br /><br />Enzo is part of a happy family, Denny, the racer; Denny's wife Eve, and his daughter Zoe.  Life is good.  But then Eve develops cancer and decides to remove herself to her parents home along with Zoe.  In the end, the parents of Eve decide to challenge Denny for custody to Zoe and do so in a manner that isn't befitting grandparents.<br /><br />This book will tear at you in so many ways and on so many levels.  Without giving too much away let me just say that I haven't felt compelled to tear up so often by a book in a long time.  Reading The Art of Racing in the Rain is like sitting through Old Yeller as a young boy and not crying. But don't let me scare you off.  The Art of Racing is a book you've got to read, especially if you love dogs (or animals in general).  With a wonderful storyline and characters you become attached to this book is cathartic.<br /><br />Garth Stein is to be congratulated on writing a book that is sure to become a classic.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver  Author: Lois Lowry.  Publisher: Laurel Leaf  Reprinted: September 10, 2002    Fry Readability: mid to late 9th grade.  Number of pages: 192  Genre: Utopian fiction    Synopsis:   This novel chronicles the workings of a utopian society.  This community centers around duty, responsibility, correctness of speech, and courtesy to others.  At the age of 11, each child must take his or her place as adults within the community. On the day of the Ceremony of 11, Jonas gets assigned the mysterious and highly respected position as The Receiver of memories.  His training centers around receiving the unremembered memories of the world. Joy, pain, love, depression, and loss pass to Jonas through The Giver of memories.  These new experiences give Jonas a new range of emotions and appreciation for life. At the same time, it begins to distance him from his family unit and isolates him from the rest of the community.  He realizes the atrocities the community commits on a day to day basis to preserve sameness and to prevent the community from feeling. He begins to plan, with the help of The Giver, to release the memories to his community and allow them to look at life in all its rich colors, its devastating pain, and its overwhelming joy.    Negative aspects of book:    This book has a couple of disturbing moments centering around \\"being released\\" or the euthanization of those who cannot conform to sameness (the elderly, the sick, twins).  My students found these parts difficult to read and even more difficult to understand. However, it did make for an interesting conversation about what a utopian society would be like and where conformity can lead a society.  While I don't believe there are negative aspects of this book, these touchy areas should be approached with sensitivity and caution.  At the same time, the issues that Lowry raises within real societies is unmistakably important for students to study and consider.  We used some of the more disturbing areas in the book as a spring board for some incredible discussion.  We even re-examined our own society in light of Lowry's critique.    My personal appraisal of book:    This book was interesting to me as a junior high student and even more interesting to me as a teacher of junior high students.  It is a classic that holds readers and thinkers to a high standard. Parts of it may be hard to read for students with a lower reading level without teacher support (sentence structure and vocabulary might prove an obstacle to understanding).  However, the story itself interested each student more and more the deeper we dug into the story.  It is thought provoking while its characters are endearing, and its community is intriguing.  It shows that without being taught, there is kindness, courage, love, and choices in a colorless, unvarying world.

1400032717|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I read Curious Incident.  I am a special education teacher and am often skeptical when I see a main character with a disability.  It is so difficult to represent a character with a disability that often times, the character is not portrayed in a realistic manner.  I was especially skeptical when I read that the main character was Autistic.  Being a spectrum disorder, Autism is a disability that is difficult to \\"stereotype\\".  No two people with Autism are the same.  They may share a few similar characteristics, but they are never the same.  So, when I began reading Curious Incident, I was surprised at how realistically Christopher had been written.  He had many typical characteristics of someone with Autism, but he was also different from anyone I had ever encountered.  He had his own personality and he had his own stims (something of fixation for a person with Autism).  Also, the way Mark Haddon wrote Christopher as a character who was very capable of managing on his own was great.  Many times, characters with disabilities are dependent on other people in order to survive or live their day to day lives.  Christopher, while unconventional, was more than capable of taking care of himself (and his father for that matter).      This was the first book of Haddon's that I had ever read.  His writing is fluid and filled with detail.  However, this story did not drag on but was quite to the point.  Haddon wrote from Christopher's perspective, almost flawlessly.  Haddon gave the rest of the world a very realistic peak into the world of a boy with Autism.  This is a book that can be enjoyed by young readers, as well as seasoned readers.

Fans know the story behind Chuck Billy and his ailments and it is amazing he still keeps on today. To have Skolnick back in the band makes this even more of a treat. Like Chucks other project, Dublin Death Patrol, this is pure Bay-area sound like it was and should be. The new cookie cutter metal bands of today (Lamb of God, Hatebreed, Killswitch and the other 10,000 that sound JUST LIKE THEM!) need to look at these icons and see how it is supposed to be done. Tried and true, the sound remains the same when it comes to Testament. Sample the title track and see for yourself...this IS the mandatory CD release for 2008 for any purveyor of metal.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This movie's not worth the time at all, the whole thing with the camera  makes you dizzy as all hell, totally makes you want to shut the movie off and throw it out, good special effects though. Acting is way overdone, and everyone happens to be \\"gorgeous\\", not one average looking person! Film crew tried way too hard on this one. Not to mention that the ending was terrible, I would not see this picture again. Was not even worth the .88 cents I bought it for!
B00005JPD0|2.0|This movie stunk. It was full of time travel and all the twist and turns that come with the possibilities. But of course we have seen it all before a million times (can you say 12 Monkey's?).

B000OVLBF8|3.0|Nick Cage is one of my personal favorite movie actors, mostly because he's so darn likeable, and he's been in some darn good movies, and some not so good. He also doesn't like to not work, so he takes most everything on his plate, and does a heck of a lot more than most other actors. This movie however is a departure for him, because it definitely doesn't seem like the movie, or character he'd play. But in the end, he somehow pulls it through, despite a very weak beginning, and a so-so middle. Darn it, I just gave you a review of most of the movie.<br /><br />Story: Around two or three in the morning on TNT a few months ago(isn't that when all the best movies are on?), I watched most of Blade 3. A generally terrible movie had it not had Ryan Reynolds to pick it up with his quirky and humorous personality. Ghost Rider amazingly has numerous similarities to Blade, from the whole supernatural storyline, hero, and yes, devilish villain (pun intended). But overall, there's nothing really interesting or compelling, or for that matter, original about the story. This is probably because the story, except for background info on the characters, is just background.<br /><br />By the way, superhero movies' back-stories have always been the weakest part of the movies. Not many can seem to pull off how they became a superhero, or their childhood story without boring me to death (think Spider-Man 1). This movie is no exception. Yes, it was very important, but could they have speed it up?<br /><br />Acting and Characters: Nicolas Cage of course saves the movie, with his personality, subtle humor, and just plain likability to an unlikable character. Johnny Depp in no way could have pulled off this role without turning it, well, into a dark Blade type movie, as opposed to a light Blade type movie (besides Depp will always being playing some version of Jack Sparrow in my mind.). Eva Mendes, is of course, as the damsel usually is, one of the weakest characters in the movie. She's a bit bland, unrealistic, and at times just does stuff that doesn't make any sense. Ghost Rider's friend (that guy from all those cancelled TV shows?) pulls off his poorly written role off quite nicely, making the character likeable. However, I don't know whether the guy is dead or not, can somebody tell me? Sam Elliot does great in his mysterious role, in which he doesn't do much, except provide a \\"twist\\" in the movie.<br /><br />Peter Fonda does a good job playing the devil, which may or may not be a good thing. Wes Bentley is very convincing, but his minions are all clearly failed Sci-fi channel actors. Which is about the worst comment you can get as an actor.<br /><br />The Effects: Nothing really jaw-dropping, or wow moments, or anything like that. No totally amazing action sequences. Instead, the action sequences look very cartoonish, and it seeps into the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, an okay movie. Nothing really amazing, nothing really horrible either. However, Nicolas saves the movie in the corny role of Johnny Blaze, in a pretty corny movie. No Oscars are coming out for this movie. But a few Razzies might pay mind. Of course, coming from the guy that made Dare Devil, I would kind of expect it. This movie wants you to think it's Spider-man quality, but really, it belongs back in the 90's. But I wouldn't be opposed to a sequel.<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5at times just does stuff that doesn't make any sense.

B0014I4KIK|4.0|Until a couple weeks ago I had never heard of Duffy, but I caught her on The Tonight Show singing \\"Mercy\\". At first glance I thought it was actress Kristen Chenoweth. The song is quite catchy and I saught out her album. Welsh born Duffy is being compared to Amy Winehouse in that she has a 60's girlgroup throwback sound. Indeed the album does sound like it was recorded in the 60's and just recently unearthed. The difference between Winehouse and Duffy is that Winehouse uses a 60's sound with modern lyrics, Duffy is going for the complete 60's sound complete with the dramatic lyrics. Favorite tracks include \\"Warwick Avenue\\", \\"Hanging On Too Long\\", \\"Mercy\\" and \\"Distant Dreamer\\"   It's a really good album if you like that throwback style. Lately it seems that the UK is breeding all the new artists with something interesting to offer.
B000MX1FE0|4.0|This book recounts an amazing tale of courage, fortitude, and the will to live, despite dire circumstances. The author, Joe Simpson, and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, attempted to ascend a perilous section of the Peruvian Andes. Near the summit, tragedy struck when Joe, up over 19,000 feet, fell and hit a slope at the base of a cliff, breaking his right leg, rupturing his right knee, and shattering his right heel. Beneath him was a seemingly endless fall to the bottom.<br /><br />When Simon reached him, they both knew that the chances for getting Joe off the mountain were virtually non-existent. Yet, they fashioned a daring plan to do just that. For the next few hours, they worked in tandem through a snowstorm, and managed a risky, yet effective way of trying to lower Joe down the mountain.<br /><br />About three thousand feet down, Joe, who was still roped to Simon, dropped off an edge and found himself now free hanging in space six feet away from an ice wall, unable to reach it with his axe. The edge was over hung about fifteen feet above him. The dark outline of a crevasse lay about a hundred feet directly below him.<br /><br />Joe could not get up, and Simon could not get down. In fact, Joe's weight began to pull Simon off the mountain. So, Simon was finally forced to do the only thing he could do under the circumstances. He cut the rope, believing that he was consigning his friend to certain death. Therein lies the tale.<br /><br />What happens next is sure to make one believe in miracles. This is an absorbing read and one of the great stories in mountaineering literature.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|This is REM at its best in 10 years!  REM has (FINALLY!!!) returned to its roots of jangly Buck guitar and divine Stipe/Mills harmonies.  From the very first track this album is channeling LRP and for once in a decade they have an album that can be listened to from beginning to end (think OOT & AFTP).  One where the tracks flow into each other and don't beg the use of the 'next track' function on your cd/dvd player.  While I have plenty of favorite moments over the past three albums none of them gave me the feeling of oneness but more that of individual experiments compiled together.  This is the album REM fans have been waiting for!!!  An absolute masterpiece!

B0001NBMBC|5.0|What Can i say. Three nil to Slipknot for creating 3 off the chain albums. The opening, Prelude 3.0 is the song the band plays when the open up live, and it really sets the mood. However, it is no way near the level of intensity you get when 'The Blister Exists' rocks the stereo. 'Three Nil' in my eyes and ears, is one of Slipknots greatest Hits. The others 'Duality','Vermillion','The Nameless' are other great songs. I am not too bigger a fan of 'Before i Forget','New Abortion' and 'Pulse of the Maggots', but 'Danger Keep Away' and 'Circle' gives you another melodic experience and shows that Slipknot isnt all about Roar and thrash. All in All great album, and for a very late review, cant wait for the fourth!

Alex has raised his level of playing to a new stratosphere, with his classic riffs on The way the Wind Blows to \\"Hope\\" many of the intros are amazing. Geddy's vocals are very polished and Bass is on the mark as usual. Neil, well its the Professor with some heart felt lyrics and his spirit in great and motorcycles rides are good therapy to keep him going.   Robert Stahl
B000UFAURI|5.0|It's been almost a year since E,S,P&G has run the Billboard Charts and more importantly, won the Grammy for Best Rock Album, and it remains one of my all time favorites.  In my opinion, the Foo's are the best \\"Hard Rock\\" band presently in commercial existence.  Track one, The Pretender is an instant favorite, in classic Foo Fighter's format, it's a quiet, demure beginning, crescendo-ing to the rocking, balls-out finish, a storyline to so many of their best songs. It won the Grammy for best rock PERFORMANCE, but it's not even my favorite song on the album.    I love the introspective, \\"Stranger Things Have Happened\\".  It's the formula Grohl uses to succeed with an acoustic guitar and metronome song. We are forced to focus on the simplicity and deep introspection of his lyrical patterns.  Very similar to the wonderful \\"Friend Of A Friend\\", a song he wrote early in his career while still with Nirvana.  It's such a dramatic and underappreciated song.  The sound of the metronome being wound and the subsequent ticking gets your attention, then comes the clean, deep acoustic guitar, carrying the simple rhythm into the lyrics.  \\"I'm breathing in this silence like never before.\\"  We are lead into a likely wasted realationship with a disappointing outcome. \\"I can change, I can change, I can change, but who do u want me to be?\\" is the strongest line in the song, and is so symbolic of a guy trying to adapt to his mate's desires, but falling short.  \\"I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm the same, what do you want me to be?\\" This solidifies the frustration felt by Dave, or the main character in this song, who has done nothing different, but apparently underperformed by the will of his suitor. That's my take on it.  \\"Long Road to Ruin\\" is my Ringtone, and I am probably responsible for selling at least 20 albums by this alone.  It's most easily described as a CSNY song, but it's full of Genesis and other prog rock changes.  Very refreshing and upbeat.  I will end now, as I am sure thatthere will be others to come.  I heard an interview with Dave when he said that he wanted to get out when he turned 30.  I'm glad he has changed his mind.  I actually like these guys better than Nirvana.  Please don't kill me for that statement, I am just a bit overwhelmed with grunge and all of it's countless sound-alikes.  Yes, Nirvana was a wonderful band and I was there for the whole 80's hair-band to grunge musical transformation, but this is the MOST serendipitous thing that has occurred in modern rock.  Cobain's passing (Listen to \\"Too Cool Queenie by STP for their take on this), resulted in the formation of this amazing band.  They are ever-changing, and are currently defining what AMERICAN ROCK IS in this new millenium.  Tell me otherwise.
2067002627|5.0|I purchased [[ASIN:2067002627 Michelin Battle of Normandy Map No.102]] to help us guide ourselves around Normandy this spring while looking for war ruins such as bunkers, and memorials and cemetaries.  The map is very detailed and was excellent for planning the trip before arriving in France.  However, after driving in Normandy, I was startled that I could actually depend on this map for navigation!  Even though it is a map from the 40's, many things have not changed in Normandy!  While some cemetaries that were identified on the maps are no longer US cemetaries (for example, we exhumed our dead from a current German cemetary and reburied them in the US cemetary near Omaha beach), practically every other feature identified on the map is accurate.  These include the memorial markers, gun batteries, parachute drop zones and even the towns which had a lot of battle damage.  The road numbers are the mostly the same so it's easy to get around by using this map.  If you're touring Normandy you will be very happy you brought this map with you and used it.  It's also readily available in many museums in the area.

She loves it so much she even 'takes care' of it, sleeping with it at night and gently turning the pages (all other paperback books have been ripped thus far). If you don't own this, you need to.

0385333846|5.0|Following \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" Kurt Vonnegut swore off novels. In the introduction to his 1970 play, \\"Happy Birthday, Wanda June,\\" Vonnegut quotes himself: \\"I'm left-handed now, and I'm through with Novels. I'm writing a play. It's plays from now on.\\" Thankfully he didn't keep this promise. \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" appeared a mere three years later. An eye blink in time. Maybe Vonnegut thought he couldn't outdo his 1969 masterpiece? His Everest was conquered, so to say. Understandable, because \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" remains his most quoted, chatted about, and revered book. And though it fits square-peg square-hole right into his body of work, he never wrote anything else quite like it. Next year it  turns 40. It has had a difficult life. Some potty-mouthed irreverent language made it anathema to didactic schoolmarms and the straight-laced. But controversy usually bites back, and the book entered the national spotlight. Censorship has always fueled sales. Even back then. Business 101.<br /><br />\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" tells the story of a secular messiah optometrist, Billy Pilgrim. Like Vonnegut, who appears as the \\"I\\" and \\"me\\" throughout  the book, Pilgrim was in a bomb shelter when Allied forces firebombed the cultural haven of Dresden to absolute smithereens. Historical descriptions are ghastly. Though the German government later revised the initial estimates of 135,000 dead to around 35,000, it remains a brutal massacre nonetheless. Pilgrim comes to Dresden via the Battle of the Bulge where he and his companions are captured and shipped in miserable rail cars to a prison camp. There, proud and hearty British officers feed and entertain them until the Nazis transfer Pilgrim's unit to Dresden as laborers. Once there, they sleep in \\"Schlachthof-f&uuml;nf,\\" or \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" where meat was once processed. Soon after, the city gets drenched in flames as the prisoners sit helplessly in subterranean bomb shelters. Horror awaits them when they emerge. Dresden now looks like the surface of the moon.<br /><br />Though Dresden's destruction undoubtedly provided the inspiration for Vonnegut's magnum opus, the story focuses more on the life of Pilgrim and his revelations on temporality. But being a \\"witness\\" to Dresden carries far-reaching implications. And there is nothing linear about this narrative or its implications. It begins, famously, with the line \\"Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\\" Like Christ, on who he's loosely modeled (hints abound throughout the text, though this is by no means a religious book), Pilgrim has \\"good news\\" for humanity. Good news about time and the impact of death. We've been wrong all along, it turns out. After surviving Dresden, becoming a rich and successful optometrist, Pilgrim gets abducted by aliens in 1967. They take him 446,120,000,000,000,000 miles from earth. There he becomes the center of attention, the supposed \\"perfect specimen\\" of humanity. Even his urinating causes cheering. In short, he's in an alien zoo. These aliens, known as Tralfamadorians, give Pilgrim a new view of time. Time isn't linear, they tell him. It's total. Every moment has always existed and always will exist. So we live forever. On top of that, in the zoo Pilgrim gets to mate with a human hottie: Montana Wildhack (as opposed to Valencia, the unattractive woman he marries for money and stability). All of his dreams come true. He no longer fears death (presented as violet light and a hum). He's free, and he wants to tell the world. Of course humanity, including his own daughter, consider him nuts. Pilgrim has internalized this philosophy of time, and he jumps from one episode of his life to another, seemingly at random. Only Kilgore Trout seems to understand.<br /><br />Pilgrim's view of time provides the novel's main tension and theme: the old hoary question of free will and determinism. The Tralfamadorians are deep determinisists. In fact, Earth represents the only planet they know of where talk of \\"free will\\" occurs. They provide the mouthpiece for one of Vonnegut's most poignant lines: \\"Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.\\" Such passages have led to debates concerning the novel's view of free will. Was Vonnegut denying free will? Does he think we have any control over our destiny? The novel doesn't take sides. Instead, it presents a middle path in the form of a brilliant Vonnegut cartoon. A locket hangs between two potato shaped breasts - Montana Wildhack's breasts. It reads: \\"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom always to tell the difference.\\" So are we free or determined? Both. The most important thing humans can do is know the limits of our powers. Some things we can change, other things we cannot. With this masterstroke, Vonnegut also helps redeem the often disparaged medium of cartoons.<br /><br />Finally, no discussion of \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" can ignore the book's most ubiquitous phrase: \\"So it goes.\\" Vonnegut inserts this laconic quip whenever a death occurs. Some have interpreted this move as making light of or as dismissing the impact of mortality. But this repetitive leitmotif can also produce the opposite effect: it can magnify death's impact by simple repetition. After finishing the book, \\"So it goes\\" will likely linger in the head for days. Though \\"so it goes\\" represents and calls attention to death, it nonetheless reads as humor, but as \\"naughty humor\\" evoking hesitant or guilty laughter. Many critics have described Vonnegut's work as a perfect combination of funny and sad. This aptly describes the effect of \\"So it goes.\\" Likely \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" a deceptively easy read, will stand as Vonnegut's major work as long as people continue to read twentieth century literature. Sadly, Vonnegut passed away in 2007. One is tempted to say \\"so it goes,\\" but unaccompanied by laughter.

B0014I4KIK|4.0|Tom Jones and Duffy - both are from Wales, so maybe there's something in the water...    I loathe Amy Wino-house - her \\"Rehab\\" song is like a nail on a chalkboard: she's the worst singer to ever come out of England.    Duffy is everything Wino-house isn't: talented, pretty, modest and real. A fantastic voice with outstanding phrasing, but please don't compare her with Dusty (very different voice)  - her closest \\"voice sister\\" on several of the tracks would be Ronnie Spector. However, it's when she \\"quiets\\" down a wee bit, when the big Phil Spector sound is absent and the sound is more Stax or Motown that she really shines.    \\"Mercy\\" is getting the most attention and it's very good - the video is fab. But the best track hands-down is #4 \\"Stepping Stone\\" - I get shivers when I listen to it.     Sadly, I fear that the hype, the tour supporting this album and the  packaging that the evil marketing people are doing might doom her - people will tire of her fairly soon and move on to the next thrill and that's a real shame.     It's obviously not her fault that she's white and British, but I can't blame some folks if they roll their eyes at the parading of yet another Great White Hope in the soul/pop genre. But: let's judge her for her talent, her voice and her song writing (she writes the lyrics and co-writes the music).      I give it four stars because there's a little too much Phil Spector on it - at times it borders on pastiche... albeit very good pastiche. But there are enough excellent tracks that make up for the Wall of Sound overkill.    As for Amy Wino-House: could someone lock her up and throw away the key, please? Now.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Listen I watch a movie for the movie.  I rarely if ever watch the extras.  Nowadays everything is green screen or blue screen anyway.  All you every really see is some guy on the extras disc sitting next to a computer talking about what he did to make the scene on the computer. I'm sorry but this is not that interesting.  I'm sick of hearing people bitch about it and give good transfers on blu bad reviews because of this.  This does not help someone purchase it. Is this really so important to you 1 star people for the  Master and Commander blu-ray?  There are better things to bitch about.  And for this Peter character to compare Predator to other blu-rays.  Come on dude the damn movie was made in the mid 80's you really think the thing is going to look good as a new release transfer.  Get your head out of the clouds.  Every one of the blu discs I have from Fox I'm happy with this one is no exception.  As for this disc great picture and sound and a good movie to boot.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|WOW.  What a great movie.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat for the whole thing.  As always, you did not know how they were going to save the Galaxy, again.  Wish the TV Series had went another year or two to give Ben Browder and Claudia Black some more time in the series since \\"Far Scape\\".  Which was a also a great show.  But if you have to end it.  They did an excellent job in doing it.  Looking forward to \\"Continumum\\".  When the team time travels and mess all the time lines up.  Really looking forward to see how they will fix that mess.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I saw Dark City at the cinema in the summer of 1998 (a year that was, in general, disappointing) and I was totally blown away. I was already a fan of Alex Proyas' work after The Crow and this was a great follow-up. I won't go into the much-discussed similarities between this and a certain Keanu Reeves starring sci-fi flick that came out a year later (I reckon this was better than The Matrix anyway) but I'm glad it's getting the respect it deserves on the shiny format. If you haven't seen it, you're in for a dazzling treat. A definite buy for my collection.

B00005JKN9|1.0|Daniel Day Lewis should run away with this film, but even he is not fast enough.  He remains an absolute master of his craft, and almost surmounts the dreadful script and supporting cast.  I MUST make an exception for Leonardo Di Caprio, who has greatly improved as an actor since the appalling Titanic. The settings truly evoke old New York in the Civil War era, but that's where it ends.  WHY did they waste Liam Neeson on a role that's over before the credits begin?  As for Diaz...one can only ask Why?
0618918248|5.0|I'll keep it short.    This book was phenomenal.  It reinforced many beliefs that I've already had and it helped me to clarify my own thoughts further.  Having grown up in Europe, I've noticed that here in the U.S., the evangelicals are quite fanatical and are really no better than some of the muslim extremists.  In particular, I enjoyed the argument by Dawkins that people who are not bound by the bible are no less moral than the Christ Nazis.  In fact, personally I believe that a higher level consciousness is much more important that anything the bibles tells us.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|A friend described \\"Rockferry\\" as the greatest debut album released since the first Pretenders album.  Reviewers liken her to 1960's British icon Dusty Springfield, while others term her a new \\"Amy Winehouse.\\"  Duffy apparently was a runner-up on the Welsh version of American Idol in 2003 or so.  If she was the runner-up, then who the heck won?      She's an original and charming performer with a voice that will blast you out of your seat.  All 10 songs on this debut that Duffy also co-wrote with Suede's Bernard Butler are potential breakout hits.  Duffy delivers \\"Warwick Avenue,\\" \\"Mercy,\\" \\"Rockferry\\" and most of the other songs and B-sides linked to the album with total sincerity.      Along with friends, I attended her May 12, 2008 concert at NYC's Apollo Theater, an appropriate venue for a blue-eyed queen of soul (hence the Dusty comparisons). The set was short, only about 70 minutes or so.  But Duffy and her wonderful band rocked the house, leaving the audience in awe of her vocal pyrotechnics. If you get the chance, do not hesitate to see her live.      We liked her so much that I stood in line the next day to hear her at an in-store appearance where she did a great acoustic three-song set.  I haven't stood in line to meet an artist before. But it was a pleasure to have a chance to say hello and wish her well with this awesome CD.  Buy a copy now when it's $6.99 on Amazon. Otherwise, the price is going to jack up as more hits emerge from this beautifully-produced set. Kudos to Rough Trade Records for putting her together with Butler and striking solid gold (do they have gold and platinum albums anymore?)    If you can, also seek out  an Internet copy or check out YouTube to listen to another future #1 hit - \\"Breaking My Own Heart\\" (not a track on Rockferry).      Duffy is the real deal and deserves an amazing career.  She's attractive enough to be a movie star with a voice that comes along once in a generation.  She also seems like a genuinely nice person and someone who really appreciates what is sure to be a devoted fan base.
B00110K3BY|5.0|Just getting into Zappa, I bought this because of reccomendations and the price (2 albums for 1). Apostrophe is a great album, honestly I haven't listed that much to Overnight Sensation; I can't get past Apostrophe. It's such a great album. Like another reviewer wrote, there are mainstream Zappa songs, middle of the road songs, and abscure songs. There is a little bit of everything on this CD. Personally, I think the last two songs on Apostrophe are good (Uncle Remus and Stinfoot), the rest are EXCELLENT (Snow, Nanook, SAPB, FO'B, Cosmic, EF, and the title track)I have recently purchased more Zappa albums, (which are all great) this one is HIGHLY RECCOMENDED !!!! If you need a first, just getting into Zappa, album, start here....it worked for me !

B000YAA68C|2.0|Any movie that starts with a juvenile fight between two lovers should be a sign that it will not be a great indulgence on the behalf of the movie/DVD watcher.  This film is one of those.  Even the assemble of the superior female cast of actresses like: Hilary Swank, Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon cannot save this movie.  Love between two people is universal and we all love differenly.  But the idea of arranging fun outings for the remaining spouse after the other one is long gone, is spooky if anything else.  Mourning is personal and we deal with it in our own ways and having friends and family involved in some scheduled string of fun outings is just plain weird.  If you are a fan of the romantic comedy there are better ones out there that this one.  You can skip this one and not regret it at all.

B000QQH4YS|5.0|Between Amazon's own image, and the user images posted of this DVD release, I was salivating to get my hands on the steelbook case. But, as was mentioned below, Amazon apparently no longer offers that case. Just a regular slip-cover cardboard sleeve and plastic case.<br /><br />That aside, awesome movie. Obviously. And for only $10.99, Amazon is offering the best deal that can be had.<br /><br />So if you're a fan of this movie and can wipe away the tears of not getting the steelbook case, you'll certainly love this set as it's probably sure to become the most complete release this flick will ever see.
B000002C25|5.0|I love Oasis. There I said it. I kind of look at them as a guilty pleasure. Its bombastic rock music. They want to be the Beatles of this generation, all the while knowing no one will ever be the Beatles of any other generation again.     That being said, they are still one amazing band. I absolutely love Whats the Story Morning Glory AND this album, but I feel this one is slightly better as a whole.     First, the album kicks of with a grand rollicking anthem that is catchy and you never even know that you just spent almost 8 minutes listening to rock at its best. My other favorite songs on the album include Dont Go Away, Fade In-Out, and the touching Stand By Me which I have yet to figure out why this song hasn't been used over and over as a movie anthem.    I have yet to buy an Oasis album that isn't worthwhile, but if you are looking to start the collection, this is where to start. There is no filler and every song is top quality.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|I saw the show in Las Vegas last summer, a few days shy of it's one year anniversary.  The music in the theater is played in surround so that's why I bought this addtion.  It contains both a standard CD as well as a 5.1 surround sound disc.  The music re-mixes from the original recordings are beyond belief.  Even though we've all heard these songs a thousand times before, the clarity of these re-mixes makes it almost like they truely are \\"new songs\\".  Hearing alternate versions of songs as well as mixing the drums from one song into the melody of another (how'd they do it?) sound amazing.  Listen to the end of Strawberry Fields and hear almost a half dozen different songs interwoven at the same time.  It isn't for everyone, in fact most Cirque soundtracks probably won't mean as much if you haven't seen the show already, but you don't have to see \\"Love\\" to enjoy listening to these versions of Beatles classics.
0756404746|5.0|I bought it because of the picture on the spine (no kidding). I thought it would provide a bit of distraction for a few nights. It took one. I began reading it and couldn't put it down. It was wonderful, up until about 20 pages to the end when I realized the next book was not yet in print!  I wish I had waited until the next in the series was available, and had bought both at the same time. The anticipation is killing me! I don't know that my reaction to any book has ever been like a first hit of heroin.   I'm hooked -- bring on the next installment.
1932907009|5.0|True Story.  Was killing time at a Borders, waiting for a movie to start, and came across this book because of it's interesting title and cover.  When I picked it up and realized it was a book on screenwriting I literally said to myself:  \\"Another book on screenwriting?  Just what the world needs.\\"  After perusing the other aisles and books I found myself back at the same table.  \\"Alright,\\" I said.  \\"I'll give this guy two pages to sell me on his book.  I skipped the foreward and flipped straight to the intro whose first words read:  \\"Another book on screenwriting?!\\"  Needless to say, I was sold right then and there.  In fact, after reading the intro I bought the book and skipped the movie altogether.  And man am I glad I did.  I've read McKee's \\"Story\\" and a few others on the subject of screenwriting and they each have their strengths and are somewhat useful. However, this one is, quite simply, the best.  More than once I found myself thinking \\"I wish I had read this book three years ago and said to hell with all the rest.\\"  Not to say there wasn't anything learned or gained from them, just illustrating how effective his way of breaking down the science and the art of the screenwriting process is.  Additionally, I appreciated the humor throughout as well as the analysis, examples and the fact that he focus' on the This-Is-What-You Have-To-Do-If-You-Want-To-Sell-A-Script ideology.  Interesting how all the other books dance around this issue and clearly a testament to Snyder's knowledge and success in the business. If you really, really want to learn the way it's done, cough up the cash and buy this book now.  I promise you, you'll be glad you did.
B000I5X824|4.0|I can't say much more than what's already been said by everyone - fantastic piece of work, indeed.  But after downloading, I was disappointed to find that \\"It's Been Awhile\\" was not the explicit version, like the album advertises.  I wrote in and it was explained to me that they don't have the explicit version of this song for download - just the radio friendly version.  I got a credit, and that's fine, but wanted to give everyone a heads up on this.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|One would think that the creation of a movie based on the music of the Beatles would be a good idea.  And, in fact, it was . . . see A Hard Day's Night or even Yellow Submarine.  Although some of the music was well-done in ATU, the plot was very loosely pieced together.  Add somewhat psychadelic cinematography to the mediocre acting and dialogue and chunk hurling will ensue!<br /><br />If only it carried on the tale of those curse-wielding cowboys of the cosmos Memsahib Duran so accurately portrayed in her critically acclaimed The Duke of Shadows?

B00004T9UF|5.0|Anybody who's been listening to rap music for the last 10 years knows eminem.  Following up from his multi-platinum cd; the slim shady lp comes the marshall mather's lp.  Even though this cd came out in 2000, it still gets play from me in my cd palyer.  As my title states, this cd is a lot darker than his first cd.  Probably the most violent song on the cd is kim; where he is talking about killing his wife and at the end of the song strangles her and leave her at the river.  Some of my other favorite songs from this cd is the deep song stan, kill you, the way i am; which has em talking about how he wants to be by himself and not bothered all the time,the hilarious first single the real slim shady, remember me, amityville; which has bizarre dropping a pretty funny but sick verse, marshall mathers; where eminem is talking about boy/girl groups, ICP, and how everybody on his n*** because he is selling records, under the influence, b**** please II, who knew, and criminal.  This cd is an eminem classic and probably the best rap cd that came out in 2000.  If you want some dark, deep music with funny punchlines, then pick up this classic album.
B0010VD7EO|3.0|While I have to say that I was totally overwhelmed by the type of music heard here, the album was a lot more than I had expected. Like another reviewer, I first heard this band on late-night TV, and listening to the album itself made the music sound better. It has less electronic than I thought it would when I read the overview (when I think of electronica I think of more than 4 x 4 beats or a little electronic spinning), and is more of an alternative offspring than I wanted. Still, that did not bother me all-that-much.<br /><br />Off the top, I noticed how the album does not have a constant flow and normally that is bothersome. At first, it actually impacted the way I saw the music, but more plays showed me that the album might be a little out-of-order but that the music was still good. It also jumps around soundwise a lot - in some places it has an older feel and there are nu-er feels in others, with the band trying to span different types of sound while not being boring. In some places that impacted me on the style front, with the type of music not really settling well on me. Still, that is more of a personal opinion and not a fair assessment of the band.<br /><br />Should you buy the album? Well, I think the album is good in places but I really would not have purchased the album as a whole. I like digital downloads and the album falls in that realm for me. That said, if you are a CD collector or just want to try out something new, this isn't bad. It has a nice upside, some downsides, and a bit of in-between.

B000AL5OZK|3.0|This was Agnetha's first solo album to be sung in English. It was released right after the last ABBA records. Released worldwide(even in the USA)this was produced by British pop producer Michael Chapman.  Many of the songs are good vehicles for Agnetha's voice. For that reason, this album appeals to some fans.    This album does not compare well to Agnetha's ABBA's records which was the standard some record buyers were using. Nor does it seem as personal as Agnetha's Swedish solo work ,perhaps, because only one of the songs here was written by Agnetha,the so-so song \\"Man\\". Agnetha found writing songs to be hard work by the 1980's and thus did not write many songs by this time. Yes,afolks she actually wrote most of the music for the songs on her 1970's Swedish solo albums.     The best songs here are probably \\"Can't Shake Loose\\", \\"The Heat  Is On\\" and the title track. But, I don't think any of the songs really impress me on this album.    Strangely a few of the songs (\\"Take Good Care of Your Children\\", \\"Once Burned Twice Shy\\", and \\"Stand By Your Side\\") have a sort of light soul sound.    If \\"Can't Shake Loose\\" sounds very similiar to  Frida's \\"Something Going On\\" it's because both songs were written by Russ Ballard. Oddly, both these  songs got played by American Album orientated rock stations (the stations that would play Van Halen or Led Zeppelin that would never play ABBA)..    The most amusing song here is \\"Mr. Persuasion\\" which sounds like it would make a good song for a exercise video with it's \\"You take me UP, DOWN chorus. It also has a great line-\\"Well have a mind but I put it on vacation\\"...    This album was recorded at Polar in January to March 1983 by ABBA Engineer Michael Tretow. Some ABBA band people like the ever-faithful Bass player Rutger Gunnarsson played on it.    There was some debate as to whether or not to use Agnetha's last name on the cover. Record Companies wondered whether DJ's would be able to say Aggie's last name. In the end she decided that her last name would stay. After all, people probably couldn't her say her first name correctly either and \\"ANNA\\" wasn't an option at this point in the game.    I am amazed that somebody can be the most prominent member of a group that sells 300 million records and still Professional DJ's dont know to say her name!    The 2005 remaster features two songs recorded for a movie called P&B those songs are \\"It's So Nice To Be Rich\\" (A-side, P&B (b-side),as well as two versions of her duet with Tomas Ledin called \\"Never Again\\" and a dance mix of \\"The Heat Is On\\".

B00151G08Y|5.0|Pendulum is back in full force with their sophomore effort \\"In Silico\\"!!  True, the traditional D&B heads who hated \\"Hold Your Colour\\" & said that it was too commercial are gonna hate this one even more, but be a litle open minded & you'll love the album.  The entire band coming from rock based roots, they've switched to live instruments so they can play live rather than just spin their sets.  This has lead to a more rock sound & feel.  Pendulum have taken everything good about their 1st album \\"Hold Your Colour\\" & amplified it times 100!  Every track on the album feels epic much like \\"Slam\\" & \\"Hold Your Colour\\" from their previous album.  Now don't get me wrong, the album is definately different.  As I said before, they've gone with a more \\"rock-y\\" kinda sound with alot more guitar & whole lot more vocals.  The vocals are great though, & sound like something coming from an accomplished artist, rather than the cheezy diva stuff so prevelent in the electronic music scene today.  Also gone are the hard & dark D&B sounds from their previous album with tracks such as \\"Through The Loop\\" & \\"Tarantula\\".  The DB is still their, but they've opted for more of a Breakbeat feel with this album again having to do with playing live instruments now.  One thing for sure though is that THIS IS PENDULUM!!  It's different, but you know it's still them.  The only problem I have with the album is that it's over too soon with only 10 tracks.  I just  hope we won't have to wait another 4 years for their next album.  \\"In Silico\\" is amazing from start to finish with not one dud or filler track & I say \\"Keep it comin'!!!\\"  This is one of (if not the) 1st must own albums of 2008 & something everyone should own.  Buy it right now!!!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that 9 times out of ten i ABHOR musicals.  HATE THEM. I gave this a shot only because my boyfriend brought it home.<br /><br />Guess what? This is one of my favorite movies, hands-down. Ever. I was totally blown away by it. I laughed, I cried (and so did my partner - suffice it to say that after realizing he cried at movies, I fell in love - and perhaps I might be a little biased about this movie because of that).  I was thoroughly impressed not just by the musical segments (yeah, truly!) but by the storyline, too.<br /><br />Buy it, rent it, watch it, love it.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I have NO idea how they managed the special effects while filming with a hand held,but there wasn't a moment that anything looked other than REAL.The perspective in which you are taken for the ride is more effective than any other genre could hope to capture.It is THE BEST monster,screaming,running,dying movie EVER.Period.
B00132D808|4.0|Okay, okay, I'm not going to say anything new, here. It's simple. Panic's \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" was awesome. Great beats, great lyrics. I fell in love with the more punk-ish, rock-ish vibe and the way that Brendon sings (we love him, don't we!). People are absolutely right when they say the \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" is pretty different. Honestly, at first when I previewed the songs online before it came out, I was kind of disappointed because I loved what I considered \\"classic Panic\\"...that upbeat, big band sound. However, I knew that I loved Panic as a band, even if their sound did change drastically on their sophomore album, so I bought it. After a few listens, it kind of grows on you.     I'd say the most similar song to \\"A Fever..\\"'s sound is \\"Nine in the Afternoon,\\" so I liked that one right off the bat. Other ones I started liking were \\"The Piano Knows Something I Don't Know,\\" \\"Pas de Cheval,\\" \\"The Green Gentlemen (Things Have Changed),\\" \\"I Have Friends In Holy Spaces\\". The songs that stand out the most in terms of sounding unique are \\"Folkin' Around,\\" which definitely has a twangy folk-vibe (which is cool 'cause I don't some country) and \\"Northern Downpour,\\" which is a lot softer-sounding and slower(almost too slow for me, really). \\"Behind the Sea,\\" \\"Do You Know What I'm Seeing?\\" and the instruments from \\"When the Day Met the Night\\" are the most Beatles-y tracks.    Overall, a solid album, I think. It's a very different sound, definitely more Beatles-inspired, you can hear the Abbey Road studios influence. Not a bad thing, but I don't know if it'll grow on you as quickly as their first album. If you're dithering about it, just buy the album already, it's a good listen, and after a few rounds, you'll be glad you did, you Panic fan, you!
B0014CQNTK|5.0|When a fine screenplay is written and actors come together and hit all the right notes, bringing it to life, you get something like JUNO. A rarity, too often, in todays cinema.<br /><br />Nothing pretentious, or you might think preachy, about a young high school girl that reluctantly comes to the realization that she's pregant and goes through the gamant of feelings about what to do, all the while trying to maintain her confident, sarcastic attitude like nothing is bothering her.<br /><br />JUNO is real life and charm and you watch the film, forgetting that you're watching a film. You feel as though you're seeing yourselves or your neighbors living their lives.<br /><br />JUNO is written with tremendous wit and heart. The actors involved should all be commended and they will be rewarded with a film that will live on for ages. I've seen Michael Clayton, There Will be Blood & No Country for Old Men and without question, JUNO has been the movie that has made the biggest impact on society and will be watched 10 years from now.<br /><br />Then you throw in a killer soundtrack and people everywhere singing, \\"Anyone Else but You\\". Everything about JUNO is priceless.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I have not lost my mind.  In the absence of any flow of real Christian entertainment coming out of Hollywood, I think it's very important to point out that this is an extraordinarily Christian film.  Bourne is fighting evil; Bourne is seeking to discover those who have enmeshed him in what he knows to be evil; and his conscience guides him as he moves through this rapid paced, wonderfully scripted, wonderfully acted, and wonderfully directed film. His motives can never be reduced to mere revenge.  Others in the film also wrestle with serious moral issues.  But Bourne is the Knight. ----- His mission results in his extracting a moment of recognition from the villain of what the villain has done, and then Bourne proceeds to seek redemption himself in the only way he knows how.  He consciously rejects evil for good.  ---- Whether Christ is ever mentioned in the film doesn't matter. ----.  What matters is that this is a film reflecting deep moral values, and it is also a film you can watch with your children. There is no jarring sexuality, and the violence in the film is actually treated with conscientious respect.  It is treated with appropriate depth for the horror that it is.  ---- Until we start getting some really profound Christian entertainment from the TV and Movie execs who seem for the moment to scorn it, I think it's important to point out those films which reflect deep Christian values, and to repeat: this film is such a one.  I personally love it and have watched it more than four times.  The moments of confession and moral recognition are as thrilling as the action.  ---- Highly recommended to everybody, including families. --- Just a fine, fine piece of profound and wonderfully exciting work.  (Let me add that Matt Damon is terrific here, just as he has been in every film he's ever made.)
B0002I831S|5.0|Nothing like the original Star Trek - even if the special effects are primitive, the acting and plots are creative. And Season 1 is the best of the 3.

B000O77QDI|5.0|Ok, a lot of people hated this movie for various reasons, and everyone who hates this movie obviously needs to learn their history better!! Let me explain...   During world war 2, one of the bloodiest battles took place in Japan on Iwo Jima. This movie tells the TRUE story about the raisers of our nations flag on mount surabachi. They over took the beach on Iwo Jima, and fought their way to mount surabachi where they raised the U.S flag as a sign of partial victory. What i am saying is, this movie tells of what our soldiers do and have done in order to keep our great nation free. This movie is the only movie in year that has told of actual TRUE events on the frontlines- and it saddens me so see a country that cant even recodnize the soldiers WHO FIGHT SO THAT EVERY CITIZEN DOESNT HAVE TO.             PLEASE GET THIS MOVIE IN HONOR OF OUR SOLDIERS PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE- AND WHEN YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE THINK OF HOW BLESSED YOU ARE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE SOLDIERS WILL DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT THEIR COUNTRY AND ITS CITIZENS.    [...]      - Thank you soldiers  - Semper fi

B00068TJM6|4.0|I was well pleased with this watch.  I own a few Seiko watches but, this one is my favorite.  I love it's feel, look and it's versatility.  This watch is attractive enough to be a dress watch as well as it is pratical enough to wear everyday to work or leisurely.  I would recommend this watch to anyone looking to purchase a new watch.
B0013FBTHO|5.0|I have to admit I was a bit scared when the war of HD-DVD vs Blu-Ray came to a halt with Blu-Ray being the winner.  But there are still good HD-DVD movies available out there, and this is one of them for sure!  Has the original movie that was in theatres, and the alternate version!  You get great sound, and a FABULOUS picture on your High Def TV.  This is an item that you shouldn't pass up!
0525950079|5.0|I must admit I don't often read 1,000 page books.  And I don't recall ever reading one in less than a week.  This book however, made it easy to do both.  The pages flew by without an effort.  The plot wove into and out of the lives of each of the four main characters--Gwenda, Caris, Merthin, and Ralph, with a seamlessness that again, is not often found in books that try to spin multiple parallel tales.<br /> As were other reviewers, I too was impressed with the author's ease in venturing outside his own previously established \\"box\\" to situate the novel in the 14th century (his earlier books stuck with the 20th century).  But I was more impressed with how he develops each of his characters' stories and how he interconnects them.  The protagonists start as children, who meet for a game in the forest, and fatefully witness a scene that reveals a secret (a secret \\"with a capital S\\", knowledge of which is dangerous inherently to them, and deemed dangerous by those who share it). The children part ways, but are joined again by fate, by their choices, and by the denouement of the secret itself, as they grow into and through adulthood by the book's end.<br /> Beyond the cleverly knit plot, I found the psychological development of both the main as well as the lesser characters fascinating.  Each starts with clear strengths and weaknesses.  We watch how both sets of traits progress in different ways in each, and how characters grow in virtue, or malice, accordingly. And though the author doles out strokes of luck or misfortune quite \\"equitably\\" among  his players,  he lets each take it from there, to spiral up or down in fortune, guided by his own wisdom or impulse.  In most cases, I gave up guessing which turn a character would take next long before the author was done with him.<br /> `So what kinds of stories does \\"World Without End\\" tell so well?  We read about a town's blossoming on the border between the \\"Dark Age\\" and the early Renaissance, from superstition and witchcraft kangaroo trials, to a better enlightenment and faith, and from rigid to more fluid economy and morality, and tolerance.  We follow several love stories and marriages through some cool turns--from lukewarm to hot in one nice case, and from hot to cold to hot (and a few more back and forths in between!) in another.  We see a mind of a genius at work (Merthin), as he fights the town's retro established interests, and changes the face of the town with his innovative, skillful building.  We see how Ralph evolves from coddled and aggressive (but not evil) boy, to a man, in a way that is chilling but believable.  But I won't give more away...just read and you'll be well rewarded for your 1,000 page marathon!<br />[[ASIN:0451207149 The Pillars of the Earth]]garoo trials, to a better enlightenment and faith, and from rigid to more fluid economy and morality, and tolerance.

B000MRA5EM|4.0|I was fortunate enough to see this film in an IMAX theater and in 3D.  It was absolutely stunning.  Beautifully done.  I had not known that Danny Elfman had done the music for it, but recognized his style immediately upon hearing it.  My family and I all thought that the music was perfect for the film.  The narration was great, as well.  At times I thought Johnny Depp sounded much like Rod Serling, and given what we were watching, it too fit perfectly.     All of this said, when we saw the movie on DVD, we were all pretty disappointed.  I still thought the movie was beautiful, the music was perfect and the narration was good.  But, leaving out the 3D effect on the DVD flattened the movie in all ways, thereby creating a somewhat disappointing DVD.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I am a moderate fan of Radiohead, and while I have listened to most of their older music, I have only owned Hail to the Thief and this album.  As for this album, it is just beautifully composed.  These guys obviously see and music on a whole other level, which may good or bad depending on who you are.  The band continues to evolve and create original music (and maybe it does take some drug related experience).  If you are put off by the music originally, give it another listen, and also try to picture how this band put the music together (or watch a video of it).  I think that is what made me fall in love with this album.  I believe people who have reviewed this album negatively are giving emotionally powered criticisms, like Radiohead is screwing them personally, so just listen to the music and enjoy.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I know I shouldn't like \\"Juno\\" but I did and it was a nice surprise.  It's smart, sassy, funny and best of all refreshingly unsentimental.  Ellen Page plays Juno a sharp-tongued teen who finds herself in the family way after a little hanky panky in a chair with her lovably dweeby boyfriend played by Michael Cera. Juno even deposits \\"the chair\\" on her bfs' front lawn. The best part of the movie is neither teen wallows in self-pity or panic and Junos' father and step-mother take the news calmly without resorting to shreiking and hysterics but are supportive all the way.    Juno decides to look for a married couple to adopt her baby and she finds a childless yuppie couple who are desperate to have a child especially the wife played by Jennifer Garner. Jason Bateman plays the husband who doesn't work but spends his day in his home studio waiting for his big break in the music business. This is where the movie seems to be on the way to creepy.  Both Juno and the husband like horror movies and rock bands but their tastes are different so they begin trading dvds and cds and Juno begins to spend a lot of time alone with Bateman. Then one day out of the blue he tells Juno he's going to divorce his wife. Because of the growing friendship between the husband and  Juno you start to think the movie is heading somewhere that happily doesn't.    The neat thing about \\"Juno\\" is, it treats a serious subject-teen pregnancy-with a light touch and the movie turns out to be both funny and sweet-a little gem.  I'm glad I finally rented and watched it and having seen it I plan to buy it and add it to my DVD library.
B0018RBN8C|5.0|Love her sound! It does sound almost soulful to me, and kind of stripped down to a point.  I like her the most out of the girls so far whom have come over to the US from Europe.

B0013FNC38|5.0|What can I say-I truly did approach the new album with limited expectations. I mean-how many truly great songs can one guy make-he's bound to have a dud occassionally-right?<br />Wrong. Mraz Man is this generation's musical deity as far as I am concerned. I can't put into words how much his music has contributed to my life. The new album is bound for heavy play-and guarranteed to be my summer of 2008 theme album.<br /><br />Also check out Todd Carey for good music is the same general proximitiy.

B000MV9026|2.0|...because he was the only good thing about this movie. This movie had like, 6 plot changes! Mumble as the social misfit, Mumble and Gloria in love, but then things don't work out perfectly for some reason, Mumble being rejected by his people..... and several other little side things. It was really, really hard to follow.<br /><br />Robin Williams played like, 5 characters and they all were hilarious. It was the only part of the movie that was not in line with the stupid enviromentalist agenda that was being forced into the innocent minds of kids. Why would you have a movie(made for humans)about humans being the evil ones? Should we all go hug a tree and ask it to turn us into penguins?<br /><br />This movie is warped. Watch Surf's Up--it's funnier, keeps to the ONE plot from begining to end, and is much more worth your time and money than this brain-cell killing crud.

1897299214|4.0|I am fascinated with North korea so I enjoyed it.  Overall, I thought this was good but not great.  If you think you would like this book, you probably will.  It's a little boring/.  I know North Korea is stiff and uneventful for foreigners but there's just not a lot of story here.
0316067601|3.0|There's much to admire about this book. The detailed description of SEAL training was fascinating, and as the author was relating this experience he had my attention, my sympathy, and my respect. The whole portrayal of the firefight and its aftermath, when the author is being sheltered by the Afghanis, was can't-put-it-down material.    But too often, someone - the author or his collaborator - feels compelled to inject their simpleminded paranoia about the liberal media into this otherwise fascinating story. At this point the whole thing turns into a Rush Limbaugh show, and the entire enterprise crashes to the ground.     And are we really supposed to believe that as the SEALs are heatedly whispering among themselves, debating whether to murder three shepherds that happen upon them, fearing for their lives as they keep one eye out for the Taliban and the other on their hostages, someone in the group actually warns against execution because \\"the liberal media\\" could find out about it and crucify the SEALs? Please...

Our view of reality is just based upon our belief systems, which is based on what the accepted standards are at this time....and until I read this book, I accepted them just like most everyone else does.  As an analytical person with college degrees in math, I found this book to be one of the most thought provoking, paradigm shifting books I have ever read!
B0014I4KIK|4.0|This debut from sultry Welsh chanteuse Duffy is yet another wonderful trip back in time. A Dusty Springfield for our time, Duffy evokes memories of the simple, carefree and optimistic 60s in easy-going songs of love, both longed for and lost. I find her voice and style of delivery totally endearing and the music, some produced by Bernard Butler (formerly of McAlmont & Butler; David McAlmont actually sings backing vocals on a couple of tracks), some by Jimmy Hogarth, some by Steve Booker and all co-written by Duffy and her aforementioned producers, is absolutely top notch.<br /><br />That's the good news. The not so good news is that once again, I feel like I'm listening to a singer I'm not so sure I believe. In fairness, she gets by and takes me with her on most of the songs but when she sings on \\"Mercy\\", just for instance - a wonderfully breezy song that made it to #1 on the UK singles chart with ease and stayed there for four weeks or so - though the song is all about pleading and desperation but she just doesn't sound at all desperate. I don't hear any angst. It's the music that makes the tune for me, not so much her singing.<br /><br />I remember the first time I heard Mary J Blige's \\"Be Happy\\" and being reduced to tears. I genuinely believed that she wasn't (happy, that is). My heart went out to her and I remember questioning my own definition of happiness at the time. It might sound ridiculous - in my defence, I was very young - but when I first heard Donna Summer's \\"MacAurthur Park\\", I actually believed that someone had left a cake out in the rain and that poor Donna was never going to find the recipe again. I felt distraught for her. Even Madonna had me believing her when she sang songs like \\"Live To Tell\\" and \\"Oh Father\\". Eva Cassidy had me believing everything she sang without exception.<br /><br />My point basically, is that I feel that singers, especially those who decide they want to do soul, should either try to sing about what they know or develop incredibly good imaginations and/or acting skills. I have to be able to totally believe what your singing to me about and if you really want to be heralded as the real McCoy, I think that takes a bit more than a just good voice and good music.<br /><br />But like I said, Duffy does impress on a number of the songs here. My favourites include \\"Rockferry\\", \\"Stepping Stone\\", \\"Syrup & Honey\\", \\"Hanging On Too Long\\", \\"Mercy\\" (I might not believe a word she's singing but it's such a catchy, bouncy song, it's impossible to resist it. I also love the video) and \\"I'm Scared\\" - all amazing songs on which Duffy truly shines. Six out of ten isn't to be sniffed at so in balance, I have to say it's a commendable debut album well worth checking out.<br /><br />I just got back from a visit to the US and \\"Mercy\\" has been all over the radio. It also seems quite popular with MTV/VH1 \\"reality\\" shows who've been using it quite a bit either as theme or promo music, which is also quite telling. It went straight in at #1 on the UK album charts when it was released here back in March and she's had considerable success with it. I think she's going to have very similar and well-deserved success with it in America. I say good luck to her.ons and/or acting skills.

1595141715|5.0|Never mind the fact this book has a gorgeous cover, 30-odd five star reviews, and a blurb from Chris Crutcher, a YA big-name. I picked Thirteen Reasons Why up solely because of its clever premise and wasn't disappointed. This is by far one of the most unique, innovative books I've read in a long, long time.<br /><br />Clay Jensen comes home from school to find an anonymous box addressed to him. Curious, he opens it up and finds seven tapes with numbers written on them. So he sits down and pops tape 1, side A inside an old stereo. What he doesn't expect to hear is the voice of Hannah Baker, a girl he had a crush on who killed herself two weeks before, come out of the speakers. She's there to take him on a tour of her life and reveal the thirteen reasons she killed herself--one of which he's responsible for.<br /><br />Quite a heavy novel, this one is. We're taken into an extensive account of little things we do, vanilla sins we commit, on a daily basis and how they impact the big picture. It forces you to think, grill yourself about all the times you've acted a certain way and wonder how the person took it. Sitting there, analyzing every gritty, itty-bitty detail about the past along with Clay was a huge wake up call--to me and, I suspect, to anyone who reads this.<br /><br />I really, really liked this. The characters leap off the page with their development, the writing fits the mood perfectly, the voice is great, and the overall premise is just so interesting. Not once does Jay Asher get preachy or interfere. I think he handled this particular topic so very, very tastefully, and I honestly, unequivocably recommend this novel to any living, breathing being.<br /><br />*Due to its big cast and many important details, I would suggest keeping a notebook nearby to jot down each characters and their role in Hannah's death.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10<br /><br />If you're interested in seeing a Q&A session with Jay Asher or an interview with him, both are posted on my blog. Look at the archives for May 2008.
0634022296|5.0|There is never enough time to go through this book... The Beatles Complete Chord Songbook is probably the best addition to anyone's piano bench (though it will likely not be put away there) or guitar book shelf. Obviously, since it is a chord book, not a tablature book, you won't find how to play the intricates like \\"Blackbird\\" or \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" (I think it warns you of this in the foreword), nor will you find any notes on a staff. I actually prefer the guitar chord boxes even though I've been playing it on piano because it just saves paper and is easier to look at. It is so much fun to go through and play any song that I want to, and play it right. This book is perfect for sing-alongs, parties, &c. I love you Beatles!
B000063DI9|5.0|A lot has been debated about this album, and the prior release, Somewhere in Time.  Many felt Iron Maiden experimented far too much and weren't as metal as they were on their first 5 albums.  But I'm here to tell you about 7th Son, an album I consider Iron Maidens best.  First up is Moonchild, a scorcher of an opener that not only sends the adrenaline pumping, but lyrically sets the concept in motion.  In typical Iron Maiden form at this point, the opener gets your attention.  We then dive into Infinite Dreams, one of my all time favorites.  A slow burner with great lyrics such as \\"It can't be all coincidence/Too many things are evident/You tell me you're an unbeliever/Spiritualist?/ Well me I'm neither/But wouldn't you like to know the truth/Of what's out there/ to have the proof/And find out just which side you're on/Where would you end?/ In Heaven or In Hell?\\"<br /><br />It's a masterpiece, no doubt about it.  Next up we have Can I Play With Madness? At the time of release a bit of contention surrounded this song. For me, the song fits into the album perfectly, but for many, this was Maidens \\"Enter Sandman\\", a song that introduced mainstream Mtvers, and even some radio listeners to Maiden.  It's a very good song, and great to sing along to.  However It's the weakest on the disc.  But me even saying that is misleading since it's still great, and more importantly fits into the album concept.  The Evil That Men Do is a phenomenal live song, and a rip roaring track on this cd.  Also, the lyrics shine here with verses like \\"Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems/The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me/And I will pray for you, someday I may return/Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn/\\"<br /><br />Breaking from tradition we have the title track, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  I say breaking from tradition because it's the longest track at close to ten minutes, and usually those cuts were saved for the last slot on the album.  This song is once again among Maidens best.  By this point you get the message...and perhaps can even gloss some of the story from my admittedly quick impressions.  But the final three songs are where the entire concept comes together with The Prophecy, The Clairvoyant and Only The Good Die Young. The Prophecy is so good from first line to last that most people say this and Infinite Dreams are the first immediate classics upon first listen.  Here's the first verse, and you'll see why:  \\"Now that I know that the right time has come/My prediction will surely be true/The impending disaster it looms/And the whole of the village is doomed/Why won't you listen to me/is it so hard to understand/That I am the real seventh son/Your life or death on me depends/\\"<br /><br />As you can see, there are people who refuse to believe in his prophecy.  After this, The Clairavoyant expands upon the idea and shows that he has died.  And the cd ends with Only The Good Die Young, which is a great capper to a great concept album.<br /><br />Overall I fluctuate on my favorite Maiden Albums.  However, I know this much:  If we are to combine quality of music, lyrics and subject matter, then Seventh Son stands at the top of the list.  You can't go wrong with this album.in among Maidens best.  By this point you get the message...and perhaps can even gloss some of the story from my admittedly quick impressions.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I can't even begin to tell any Beatles fan how amazing this album, and show, is. After a long 3 years of waiting to turn 21, my man took me to Las Vegas to celebrate. I had only seen one other Cirque du Soleil show before, but was convinced I would like it just because it was set to the wonderful music of The Beatles. Was I ever right!! This show is so moving, mostly in part to the strict care given to the show's ever-important soundtrack, a collection of mostly re-produced Beatles songs (a few remain mostly untouched) produced by four gentleman, including George Martin, the original Beatles producer, and his son. Any Beatles fan will more than rejoice in this loving mix of the Beatles' best. Be sure to purchase this, especially if, like me, you have basically the entire Beatles catalogue. There will never be a truer celebration of the world's greatest rock band. I love you Beatles!
B000NPTJ7W|4.0|If you can get past the testosterone-soaked prose--with many references to the military and no references to women in the workforce--you'll find some timeless principles related to managing time, cultivating strengths rather than fixating on weaknesses, and focusing on the bottom-line contribution.
B000YAA68C|5.0|We just finished watching the movie and cried our eyes out. We cried because we were devasted for Holly and then cried because we thought Jerry was so loving and thoughtful to do what he did to help her cope. And then cried when... well you get the idea. It was a great stress reliever and made our hearts smile.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|You probably can't call it \\"trip-hop\\" anymore, but it's still unmistakenly Portishead. The only real difference from the two albums they made a decade ago is that instead of beats and scratches, Beth Orton's haunted vocals and melancholy melodies are dressed in more organic fare. It's all still a little creepy, a little trippy and really, really sexy. And I still really, really dig it.
0471702188|5.0|The book itself is excellent and exactly what I was hoping for.    Amazon Customer services assured me that the CD was included and even sent me a second copy but there was no CD again.....  I thought it was too much of a bargain to be true...and it was !!  I will scrutinise the summary more diligently next time ;)
B000XA5K4I|2.0|I had high expectations for this film and it was just... such... a... let... down.  Tons of style with   ABSOLUTELY no redeeming value.  I really felt some good actors were completely put to waste here.  Maybe a good rental but was very sorry I wasted the money on it for blu-ray.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Slow blues with feeling.  Wow.  My daughter told me about Melody Gardot and she is great.  What's more to say.
B000026I8U|5.0|As always, I love his music. I am delighted it was reissued at a reasonable price.
1844138518|5.0|The internet has changed the way consumers consume.  In his book \\"The Long Tail\\", Chris Anderson explains how the internet has created a unique culture of endless choice, and unlimited demand.  This has created a \\"Long Tail\\", whereby it is no longer economically viable for the big conglomerates to chase the mega-hits (Top 10 music, best selling books, this seasons must-have product), as the bulk of sales has shifted to items that may only sell one unit a month.  It is the sum of all these sales that for the first time in history has surpassed the high volume items and created a whole new market for niche products.<br />Chris thoroughly examines the long tail phenomenon with detailed examples across multiple industries and niches.  Chris has a vey easy to read style, and goes into great detail to support his hypothesis, which in the end I concluded was not conjecture, but actual fact.<br /><br />This was a thoroughly enjoyable read, and I would highly recommend it to anybody who likes to remain on the cutting edge or technology and trends.<br /><br />Leigh Burke<br />Author of Niche Internet Marketing
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I made it through to the end unlike some other reviewers. I found the book to be well written and the narrative voice held my interest in a rubber-necker sort of way. I kept wondering what absurdity might appear on the next page. The story is more about the vacuous boredom some people experience when \\"success\\" means they don't really need anybody or anything. Gilbert lamented her own emotional woes without acknowledging the trail of destruction she left in her wake.
B00005JPS7|4.0|Man, this thing has been advertised like crazy - I've seen way too many commercials, trailers, action figures, and news all over the net.  Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreu have been more than confident they have a winner in Iron Man.  With the amount of hype I think I got burnout and I wasn't that interested in seeing Iron Man afterall.  Everyone I talked to loved it so I figured why not.  Turns out everyone was correct and you can believe the hype folks - this is one great film, and sure enough one of the best of 2008 already.<br /><br />This isn't your typical superhero movie, its better than that.  For the most part I didn't feel like I was sitting through a typical superhero film.  There is almost a realistic feel throughout this film unlike some superhero films (but don't expect things to be believable sometimes).  Details are laid out on how everything is built and works.  There is a definite maturity within the storyline and actors.  In fact, the top four actors in the film have all had some big awards in their past.<br /><br />There are two parts of Iron Man.  First you've got the Afghanistan storyline and the Obadiah Stane story (Jeff Bridges) who turns out to be the movie bad guy (and gives Iron Man one heck of a fight in the end).  The creators have done away with the outdated evets on how Iron Man came to be in the comic books, and placed the film in a touchy present day situation, placing Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) as a captive within Afghanistan.  This has a huge impact on Stark's life and the man he will become throughout the film (not just the superhero he becomes, but the person he becomes too).  Obadiah doesn't like it and next thing you know we got quite a villain to deal with.<br /><br />The visual effetcs were provided by Industrial Light & Magic and the sound by Skywalker Sound, in other words you can expect incredible effects that don't dissapoint.  Accompany that with great comic relief, great actors and characters, and an impressive story and you got one film you can't miss out on.<br /><br />And as a bonus, this is just the beginning.  Iron Man 2 is already in works.  Though I missed it in the theatre, a glimpse of Captain America' shield can be seen in Tony's lab.  And don't forget to watch the new Hulk film this June (ditch the old one with Eric Bana).  There is to be a Robert Downey Jr. cameo in that film...something is happening with Marvel.  Oh yeah, and don't miss the end of Iron Man, like after credits end.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5lm you can't miss out on.

B00003CXRM|4.0|I don't think there is a single thing I can add to the reviews on this film that has not already been said. For the sake that I intended on saying something about each of the Coen Brother's films, I just have to say something however.     Yes, I agree. This film is a perfect, I do mean perfect, film experience. Not only do the Coen Brother's (and cinematographer Roger Deakins) bring us into the Dust Bowl era, they unintentionally bring us a piece which works as a complication for the entire history of film making. The characters, the many styles, the weirdness, the seriousness, the stupidness, the intelligence, the colors, the editing and the the story were perfectly orchestrated into this perfect film. The only other thing I can mention and haven't mentioned is the music. I have been listening to Blues music since I was in elementary school and I must say that this complication of Blues/Gospel/Country/Field work music is simply stunning.    The Coen Brothers, their actors and production team have done an incredible job on this one.
0142000663|5.0|This book will make you look around with open eyes.  I highly recommend reading this book, even if you hated it in high school.  A person cannot appreciate hardship if you are a young adult that has everything you need, and a lot of times whatever you want.  As an adult, I was able to absorb much more of the true meaning of this book.  The Grapes of Wrath will change your way of thinking about what is truly important in life.
0441013597|5.0|A fantastic novel, one of the cornerstones of science fiction.  Along the same lines as Robert Assimov's foundation, but with a more intimate scope.  Dune is a novel everyone who likes classic science fiction should (and probably already has) read.  It is a little jarring at first since Herbert changes points of view repeatedly throughout the chapters, but you get used to it after awhile.
1577314808|1.0|A friend was really excited about this book and asked for my opinion.  Here is my response.<br />I wish Eckhart would just leave Jesus out of his book because he is only using Jesus, incorrectly, to support his own ideas. This may also be true for his quotes from Buddha.  However I am no authority there to give an opinion.<br />Piously Eckhart states, \\"When I quote from the ancient religions or other teachings, it is to reveal their deeper meaning and thereby restore their transformative power - particularly for those readers who are followers of these religions or teachings. I say to them: there is no need to go elsewhere for the truth. Let me show you how to go more deeply into what you already have.\\" (Now, p. 9-10)<br />Since when does Eckhart Tolle have sole insight into truth!<br /><br />Eckhart's god is Now (He wants us to always focus on Now and our self.)  Then he goes on to say that we are god. This is ego to the max! And I thought he was trying to go beyond the ego and to stop allowing himself to be controlled by it.<br /><br />Whatever we choose to focus our energies and thoughts on IS our god.<br /><br />Eckhart is encouraging us to think of ourselves as \\"I am\\" (Now, p. 127-128). If you know the Old Testament, God revealed Himself to the Israelites as the great \\"I AM.\\"  This was to tell them that He was self-existing and could not be compared to anything else. During Christ's crucifixion trial he said \\"I am\\" in response to one of the Pharisees questions. For this he was condemned because the Pharisees well knew that in saying \\"I am\\" Christ was equating Himself with God.  Eckhart is dangerously suggesting that we are \\"I am.\\" This was Satan's error too: to want to be equal with God.<br />Here are quotes from Tolle's writings in which he claims that we are god:<br />\\"...what was left was my true nature as the ever-present I am\\" (Now, p. 5)<br />\\"Yet you are still there - the divine presence that you are\\" (Now, p. 196)<br />\\"The word God is limiting ... because it implies an entity other than you. God is Being itself, not a being. There can be no subject-object relationship here, no duality, no you and God\\" (Now, p. 224)<br />\\"The way of the cross... forces you to become as nothing, to become as God - because God, too, is no-thing\\" (Now, p. 225)<br /><br />Eckhart's books are all about \\"me,\\" and how \\"I\\" am to free myself.  For someone who is trying to escape from \\"egoic delusion\\"(Now p. 200), he is very hung up on himself!<br />It might be very enlightening to count the number of times he uses the word \\"you\\" and \\"I\\" in his book! His books are all about you. As he says in The New Earth, \\"This book is about you.\\" (New Earth, p. 6)  He also states that \\"It can only awaken those who are ready.\\" This is a very egotistical statement to make. He's saying, \\"I'm awakened. And if you don't get what I'm talking about, then you aren't part of this inner circle of special people.\\"<br />Here is the quote from The New Earth: \\"This book is about you. It will change your state of consciousness or it will be meaningless. It can only awaken those who are ready.  Not everyone is ready yet, but many are, and with each person who awakens, the momentum in the collective consciousness grows, and it becomes easier for others. If you don't know what awakening means, read on. Only by awakening can you know the true meaning of the word\\" (New Earth, p. 6)<br /><br />Tolle refers to the Bible and the teachings of Jesus without ever quoting the exact words or giving a reference. All the times he does this, he is misinterpreting the Bible. It is as though he has something to say and then looks through the Bible to support his own thoughts. He does not understand the Bible at all. He twists its meaning to serve his own purposes. Why does he even bother to mention Jesus? Is he trying to give his readers the impression that Christianity and Buddha and New Age are all one big family?  Eckhart writes, \\"When I occasionally quote the words of Jesus or the Buddha, ... I do so ... to draw your attention to the fact that in essence there is and always has been only one spiritual teaching, although it comes in many forms\\" (Now, p. 9).<br />It has been said that those people who say all religions are the same and all paths lead to God have never actually followed any path themselves.<br />Steve Turner in \\"Creed\\" writes<br />\\"We believe that all religions are basically the same -<br />At least the one that we read was.<br />They all believe in love and goodness.<br />They only differ on matters of creation,<br />Sin, heaven, hell, God, and salvation.\\"<br /><br />Here are some specific examples of misinterpreted Scripture:<br />Eckhart writes, \\"You take a journey into the Unmanifested every night when you enter the phase of deep dreamless sleep. You merge with the Source. You draw from it the vital energy that sustains you for a while when you return to the manifested, the world of separate forms. This energy is much more vital than food: `Man does not live by bread alone.'\\" (Now, p. 132).<br />Here Eckhart is quoting from Matthew 4:4: \\"Man does not live by bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.\\"<br />Eckhart misses the last part of the quote which tells exactly what is meant by the first part! Eckhart is saying that the \\"vital energy\\" is what sustains us, not God's Word.<br /><br />Eckhart writes, \\"You `get' there by realizing that you are there already. You find God the moment you realize that you don't need to seek God. So there is no only way to salvation: Any condition can be used, but no particular condition is needed. However, there is only one point of access: Now. There can be no salvation away from this moment,\\" (Now, p. 147).<br />In the Bible, John 14:6, Jesus says, \\"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father (God) except through me.\\"<br />There is only one way to salvation, through Jesus Christ.<br />And the Bible says that you do need to seek God. In Jeremiah 29:13, God says, \\"You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.\\"<br /><br />Eckhart writes, \\"The Unmanifested does not liberate you until you enter it consciously.  That's why Jesus did not say: the truth will make you free, but rather: `You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.' This is not a conceptual truth. It is the truth of eternal life beyond form, which is known directly or not at all,\\" (Now, p. 133).<br />This is a quote from John 8:31-32 which actually reads: \\"To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, `If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'\\" And a little further in the same passage, John 8:36 says, \\"So if the son sets you free, you are free indeed.\\"<br />The \\"son\\" here refers to Jesus himself, not an unmanifested being. Jesus is equating Himself with truth.<br /><br />Eckhart's books clearly lay out a dangerous philosophy that is very enticing to a self-centered world. Eckhart wants to do away with the past and future. If there only is \\"now\\" our faculties have become like an animal which considers neither the past nor the future. The truth is that the past is a valuable teacher and the future is our hope. God has given us the gift of knowing the past and looking forward to the future. The problem for us is that we do not trust God. As a result we worry about things that we have no control over. This is what Eckhart is trying to achieve by centering in the \\"now.\\"  However, he is misguided.  The solution for worry is not denial, but trust in God.<br /><br />The main page of Eckhart's website has a quote: \\"The world can only change from within.\\"  This contravenes Christian teaching. The power to change for the better is not within us, it is from God. To say that we, ourselves, can by our own determination and strength, change the world for the better, denies the power of God and pretends that we are gods ourselves. We are not the ones tochange ourselves. A better quote would be, \\"The world will only change when people's hearts are changed by God.\\"liberate you until you enter it consciously.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|The first single-disc edition of the soundtrack had 16 tracks, 6 from the first deluxe disc and 10 from the second.  This is an extremely engaging soundtrack for those who saw the film and love the Beatles' music.  Joe Cocker's version of \\"Come Together\\" blasts relentlessly with his vocal swagger putting an emotional payload on Lennon's obscure lyric, \\"He wear no shoe shine, he got toe jam football, he got monkey finger, he shoot coca cola.\\"  Evan Rachel Wood sounds like she's having a blast on \\"It Won't Be Long.\\" She makes it sound fresh, \\"Since you left me, I'm so alone; Now you're coming on home.\\"  T.V. Caprio's \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" aches emotionally with the familiar throbbing bass line putting a chronic smile on my face.  The Dana Fuchs Band with Rachel Evan Wood does my favorite track on the CD, the breezy \\"Because\\" with gorgeous vocal harmonies, \\"Because the wind is high, it blows my mind.\\"  Jim Sturgess' take on the John Lennon's title track is excellent with its sense of spiritual exploration and longing, \\"Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, possessing and caressing me.\\"  Dana Fuchs Band blows away the under-appreciated \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" with a powerful emotional wallop.  The deluxe version of the soundtrack takes great material from Lennon, McCartney & Harrison and produces one of the best celebrations of their work.  Enjoy!

B000002UJQ|5.0|What makes a great album? Many things, but you just know an album is great when it is consistent and puts out more than 2 or 3 amazing tracks. I count nine memorable songs in this album that are not filler songs; they are each unique, amazing and have their own following of fans who argue over who's favorite is the best song on the album. If any one of these songs were made by a new band it would instantly be that band's \\"Creep\\" one-hit-wonder.    Another thing I have to say about the artwork: nothing short of spectacular. Several pages of post-modernist abstract and figurative excellence are packed into the booklet and enhance the experience of the album. Kudos to Stanley Donwood.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|Will Smith's performance is incredible, as is his canine companion. But I Am Legend falls victim to two things plaguing Hollywood these days:    - Overreliance on CGI: This movie would have been much better served using live actors than CGI. The \\"uncanny valley\\" phenomenon is epitomized in this film, and the reliance on computer imaging takes away from the experience.    - Bittersweet ending: Those who have read Richard Matheson's novel know that there is no bittersweet ending involved. Instead, the movie took a turn for the worse in the second half with the introduction of a seemingly useless character who serves only as a plot device. The holes punched into the storyline by her addition show the absurdity of changing the original plot.    This is worth a rental, but ultimately I walked out of the theater disappointed by the second half of the movie. My wife and I both suspect, because of the glaring difference in quality between the two halves, that another set of writers took over for the second half. Walking out of the theater on a bad note is the worst way to render a movie!
0446577391|5.0|Well, there are so many well-written reviews of this book that all I have to say is, hooray for Annabel Conroy!  Let's see more of this smart and sassy Irish lady in Baldacci's upcoming novels.  I'm sad for one of the members (no spoilers here), and I just know Oliver/John will rise to the occasion some other day.  Baldacci kind of bored some of us with the initial Camel Club book, but The Collectors definitely brought us some anticipatory goodies.  This sequel will have you hanging onto the edge of your seat like some white knuckle ride at an amusement park.  Hang onto your hats kids, because David Baldacci is going to pull rabbits out of them the next time around if you don't.  And that's a very good thing!
0143039881|5.0|Arendt's analysis of the \\"banality of evil\\" characterized by Adolf Eichmann is a chilling look into how evil can be systematized, how it can be seemingly bureaucratic, and how normal people can be turned into monsters through law.    This is a great book for anyone interested in World War 2, the Holocaust, political philosophy, or getting really really depressed.
B000YABYLA|1.0|I can't believe this was written by a woman.  The dialogue is totally unbelievable, abortion clinics are horribly portrayed, and Ellen Page is totally unrealistic.  She cries once.  And takes pregnancy tests in public, discussing them in an offhand manner with the convenience store clerk.  I found it insulting.  Allison Janney is awesome, and so is Jennifer Garner, but those are the only likeable characters.  Well, and Michael Cera, of course.

Oprah is nothing more than a FALSE prophet that far too many people are buying into and thus sealing their ultimate fate which is eternity separated from God.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|A true timeless classic...  9 discs in the set, and each movie has the original theatrical presentation and the Directors cut.  The additional DVD's included all the special features.  I ordered this on a Saturday, and recieved it that Tuesday directly after.  Superb quality, and joy to watch.  I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a good Sci-fi movie.
1569242739|5.0|We bought this book because our daughter has an egg allergy.  The chocolate cupcakes are perfect (I did use whole milk instead of soy but I'm sure soy would be great too).  Everyone who has tried them can't believe that they are egg-less and it actually tastes just as good as my Mom's chocolate cake (with dairy) that has been a family favorite forever.  I do eat dairy but I would choose to make the chocolate cupcakes over regular chocolate cake recipes any day.  Can't wait to try more!
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|But the truth is that I will probably never listen to it in the future.  If I want to hear Portishead, I'll listen to one of the old albums.  It's not that the album is bad, it's that it's boring.  To me, in trying to sound \\"different\\" from their old stuff, they ending up sounding generic. I feel like I've heard all of this music, the actual instrumentation, before.  They sound like someone trying to imitate Portishead, or trying to make Portishead into industrial, but there's is something very definitely missing from the equation.      I bought the record the day it came out, I listened to it four times, and I probably won't play it again.  It's so disappointing.
B000065BPB|5.0|If you are doing your own recording at home these will help you out with mixing.  Unless you have a grand to spend on monitors these do an excellent job.  I took these over the Sony's for the same price because of the isolation difference. They are comfortable and not to heavy.  Good for listening to music as well.

B000TX7B5U|4.0|This is the album that System of a Down should have released after Toxicity.  Instead, they've released three brutally terrible albums (Hypnotize, Mesmerize, Steal This!),  and now they have finally went on hiatus.  My advice to Serj:  You dont need System of a Down.  This album sounds similiar to System of a Down but improves in all the areas that was making SOAD sound so incredibly dumbed down.  Everything works on this album.  Each song is catchy but also incorporates originality.  You will hear politics on this album but what do you expect?  At least you don't have to hear that horrendous attempt at singing by that guitarist in System of a Down.  Tons of pianos, violins, orchestras, african instruments.....and yes.....guitars!  There's some frantic screaming on this album by Serj but most of it includes Serj singing some really nice harmonies.  If you liked System of a Down but thought there past two or three releases were just utter crap, then I suggest you purchase this album.  Odds are you will be repeating the same advice I present to Serj:  Quit SOAD!
B00132D808|4.0|I just realized today that I am falling in love with this album.      I am a Panic! fan, so I was eagerly awaiting their new album.  When I heard the first single, Nine In The Afternoon, I liked it, but thought it didn't sound like any of their other songs.  The more I heard it, the more I liked it, and wanted more, wanted to hear the whole album.  It was like having a \\"crush\\" on the song...    Got the album, listened to it through the first time...whoa.  It was all so different, so new, and yet so familiar (if you know anything at all about the Beatles).  At first, I was disappointed.  But then I picked up a few gems- the aforementioned \\"Nine In The Afternoon,\\" of course, and the catchy, upbeat melody and harmony of \\"When The Day Met The Night,\\" in addition to the refreshing vocals of Ryan Ross on \\"Behind The Sea.\\"    But the more I listen, the deeper in love I fall.  I love the Ravi-Shankar-esque harmonies of \\"She's a Handsome Woman,\\" and I am sure that as each song works its way into my brain that I will be more and more glad that I gave this album a chance.

B00009W0U4|5.0|The intensity of this film is so ravenous that I don't think I'll be watching this again anytime soon. Gaspar Noe who has given us \\"Un contre tous\\" has raised his shock level once again.  It is hard to shake me up in front of a movie or TV screen, but Irreversible did it. Five rock solid stars for an unforgettable atmosphere, nauseating camera moves, a non linear film structure, meticulous direction and the usual rock solid performance by Vincent Kassel.
0307265730|4.0|This is to my mind the best so far from this talented writer. It is different from the short story collection in her first book.

0316067601|4.0|What a great little book about an amazing group of people who defend the USA from threats many of us are aware of, but know little about.  The author, Marcus, is a Navy Seal who was involved with one of the worst disasters in Seal Team history.  This book goes in depth into how someone becomes a Seal, and what the Seal's do for the military and our country.  The training they go through is really unbelievable - that part of the book is as good as the story of the failed mission where Marcus has to survive for five days while being hunted down by the Taliban.<br /><br />Marcus is a hard-core right-wing Texan - and he does not hide that fact.  He is honest about what he believes about the media, the 'liberal' politicians, and the like.  I may not agree with all of his political beliefs, but that does not change the fact that the story is truly moving.  I honor what he, and others like him, do for the USA.<br /><br />Joseph Valentine Dworak
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I had known about BARRY LYNDON for a while, and it was one of those films that I always wanted to see, yet wanted to wait for the right time to watch it. Well, I just watched it today, and I have to say that I loved it! I would consider it one of Kubrick's best films. However, it seems to be slightly underrated. I have no idea why...the film is perfect in every way, from the direction, the acting, the score, and the lighting (yes, the lighting). It's one of the most beautiful films that you will ever see.     Ryan O'Neill is wonderful as Redmond Barry, an Irishman who falls into high society during his life, which ultimately spirals out of control near the end. This film has the feel of a great novel. At three hours, the pacing is brilliant, and you will find that it flies by in no time at all. The story is so engrossing and the characters so well drawn, that I can't imagine anyone having a hard time sitting through it in it's entirety. Most of the criticisms for this film were mostly related to the pacing. This, I do not understand. A film like this needs to be told in three hours. If you are impatient when it comes to films such as this, which are epic in nature, I would still encourage you to give it a try.    I simply cannot tell you enough: see it! You will not regret it. It is definitely a film that you will never forget.
1402720602|5.0|If it weren't for the fact that this is a step-by-step manual, the causual observer could be forgiven for mistaking this for a coffee-table book.  It's almost too nice for a workbench!  At the risk of sounding like an advertising blurb, the same passion and craftsmanship Bogdanovich displays in his guitars shows in nearly every page.  He knows what he's doing, and it shows; the color photography is excellent, and the text is a pleasure to read - informative and concise without being dry at all.       The beauty of this book is it has something to offer to experienced and aspiring luthiers alike.  While the text deals with building a classical guitar almost entirely from scratch, much of the information given is pertinent to those attempting to go the kit route.      This volume picks up where the classic Cumpiano/Natelson text leaves off, as far as the classical guitar is concerned.  There are a few typos in the text that should have been caught by the editor, but they are obvious and not likely to cause trouble to anyone building a guitar from the book.  All in all, Bogdanovich has kindly shared his skill and knowledge in a very timely, informative volume that I for one am proud to own!
B000YAA68C|3.0|\\"P.S. I Love You\\" depressed and disappointed me.  It was not the romantic comedy that the trailers and reviews led me to believe; it was too dark and depressing.  Instead, \\"P.S. I Love You\\" is a romantic drama that chronicles the year-long struggle of Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank of \\"Million Dollar Baby\\") to overcome the death of her husband Gerry (Gerard Butler of \\"300\\").<br /><br />  Holly is constantly complaining and whining that life isn't good enough for her.  Her husband dies of a brain tumor and she's plunged into depression.  Then the letters from Gerry begin arriving.  They urge Holly to continue living her life, pursuing her dreams.  Instead, Holly clings to her dead husband even more.  When the letters finally cease arriving, it is as though he has died again.  All the while I keep hoping she will fall in love with someone, anyone, even the grungy Harry Connick, Jr.  It never happens.  In the last minute of the film, the viewer receives a glimmer of hope that she might have a lasting relationship with a handsome musician living in Ireland.<br /><br />  Lisa Kudrow of \\"Friends\\" and Kathy Bates of \\"Titanic\\" help round out a great cast.  Kudrow's comic relief was depleted too soon into the movie when she found her beau.  Bates' sour faced character was stern and pious; most of the time, she was dishing out motherly advice.  She never approved of Holly's marriage.  Swank and Butler were too muscular for their roles.  It's quite obvious that they spend a lot of time working out at the gym.<br /><br />  Beautiful New York skylines and Irish farmland and a great soundtrack were not enough to hold my interest.  I found myself getting bored.  \\"P.S. I Love You\\" dragged on and on.  One-hundred and twenty-seven minutes is too long for a romantic comedy.  When Holly received her last letter, I thought, \\"Thank the Lord.  It's finally over.\\"  But her whining and complaining began anew.  Poor Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr. of \\"Independence Day\\") was her faithful lapdog throughout the ordeal.  I kept wanting to tell Holly, \\"P.S. stop whining and stop complaining.  Get over your husband's death (he wasn't that good looking) and get a life.\\"eal.  I kept wanting to tell Holly, \\"P.S. stop whining and stop complaining.

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Overall Impression<br />The CD arrived yesterday in the mail, and it did not disappoint me.  I liked it a lot from the get go, and I think it will become a permanent fixture in my car's CD player for a long time.<br /><br />How does it sound?<br />ORGANIC is the best word that I can use to describe this Portishead release differentiating it from the other 2 Portishead albums.  It is eerie, haunting, dark, but so are the other albums.  In this release, the vocals are mixed harder than the drum&bass tracks.  Also, most of the drums and drum samples sound less electronic and less like loops than before.  The bass, in turn, tends to sound like a vintage 70's synth.<br /><br />What can you compare it to?<br />Imagine if the James Bond movies from the 60's and 70's had been directed by David Lynch.  The songs in Third would be great themes for the films.  If you are familiar with Artie Shaw's music, imagine him producing a Portishead CD and you will hear Third.
B000002GQG|4.0|The Moodies would find out here if they'd succeed in a major revamping of their sound. Most Moodies fans know that they started out with Denny Laine at the helm, sounding like if the Rolling Stones were less punky and more bluesy (try \\"Early Blues\\"). Then along came \\"Days Of Future Passed\\", but that was no indicator of what was to come--concept albums using full orchestra seldom mark a major change. The tend to be a \\"special treat\\". Hell, you take out the orchestral and spoken interludes and you end up with a pretty short album. But now it was back to doing song albums. And this one proved that the Moodies we know today were here to stay--a whole new sound under an existing name. Take a Graeme Edge poem that ramps up in intensity until it ends in hysterical laughter and segue into a driving but melodic \\"Ride My See Saw\\" and off we go. Next is the elementary school folk sound of \\"Dr. Livinstone I Presume\\" where Ray Thomas makes like Stephen Foster. I'll reserve comment on the \\"House Of Four Doors/ Legend Of a Mind\\" medley--it was trendy back in those days to see Timothy Leary as a heroic fugure. Then we open side 2 (vinyl version\\" with Justin Hayward's now-famous baritone in \\"Voices In the Sky\\". Keyboardist Mike Pinder gnext gives us \\"The Best Way To Travel\\", which has an annoying toot-toot-toot figure in the last verse that makes you think there's a bearing going bad in your player. \\"The Actor\\" is by far the best song on the album, proving that you can mix an acoustic guitar and flute and still have a good solid beat. No, Jethro Tull did NOT do it first. I suppose \\"The Voice/ Om\\" can be forgiven--those were days when it was fashionable to think that Western culture was an abomination and Eastern was the way to go. Rather than take the \\"raga-rock\\" direction, the Moodies did like the Beatles and built this song in that ole Subcontinental style from the ground up. But with the exception of that and the Leary hymn, this was the way they were to go over several albums. And thereby avoiding becoming the \\"Also-Rolling Stones\\" and carving a niche with an immediately recognizable sound. Maybe they've never been truly rock and roll in the true sense. Graeme Edge didn't trash hotel rooms. John Lodge didn't get say \\"I'm sick of being nothing but Hayward's tenor harmony\\" and walk out for a solo career--he's still there. Ray Thomas didn't die of an o.d.--he retired like any working man. Which is why I can draw my own pension and still listen to the same act I heard on the radio as a college undergrad. Neil Young once said \\"It's better to burn out 'cause rust never sleeps\\", but that ideology only impresses the very young and very angry.nd thereby avoiding becoming the \\"Also-Rolling Stones\\" and carving a niche with an immediately recognizable sound.

B0014BC3C2|4.0|Rendition, released through New Line Cinema and currently available everywhere. Starring Meryl Streep and Jacob \\"Jake\\" Gyllenhaal (last name pronounced jill-en-hall). Since it's release March 2007, the marketing for Rendition lead me to believe that there were only two people staring in this surprisingly epic movie. With a stellar supporting cast headed up by Reese Witherspoon, Rendition offers a complex back story to one of the most controversial aspects of the so called war on terror.<br /><br />During the late nineties, the Clinton administration under pressure to do something about an ever more active Al Qaeda, changed policy with regards to extradition of international criminals. The bar for so called Extraordinary rendition (and irregular rendition) was lowered. No paperwork, no approval process and no recourse to the law for the \\"suspected\\" terrorist. The target was/is literally \\"disappeared\\". Fast forward post September 11, the word international also has a much looser definition.<br /><br />Although at once apparently ripped from the headlines, Rendition also offers  up a web of intrigue, rivaling that of any of the best of published international thrillers today. At first impression, the\\"government baddies\\" in Rendition, have a mirror component to contemporary high profile figures. At closer examination and my own personal feelings after 9/11, it  is easy to understand thoughtful, family loving adults could make such decisions as to authorize the use of torture. That fear, a fear of unknowns. Uncertainty.<br /><br />The truth is, that it is still a choice. Experts agree, torture if anything, only produces bad intelligence and says nothing for the damage done for anything good the United States may wish to promote.<br /><br />George Carlin recently mused that, why on earth should someone be proud of an event that is/was totally out of your control, such as being \\"Irish\\"? What he left out was, that it is what You do with that station in life you have been presented and how can/much you make a difference. My easy advise for that...just keep talking about it.<br /><br />Growing up in the Seventies and Eighties, I don't think it ever dawned on me that the use of a word like torture or even that of a technique developed during the Spanish Inquisition known as Waterboarding, would ever be used with regards to or associated with something the United States was/is responsible for. In a recent Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing, CIA director Mike Hayden, in the absolute height of politically correct absurdity, referred to torture as, when questioned by Senator Feinstein of California, the use of \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\".<br /><br />As the story will move you and the exotic images and locales will capture your attention, the original movie soundtrack composed by Paul Hepker and Mark Kilian will haunt you. They were able to exquisitely capture the desperation, loneliness and anguish of the moment and the topic as well.e a difference. My easy advise for that...just keep talking about it.

B0010VD7EO|4.0|MGMT's new album [[ASIN:B0010VD7EO Oracular Spectacular]] really is a very good work of alternative fusion.  It's a really good start for a group that I'm just learning a little bit about now.<br /><br />The mix is definitely ecclectic and certainly must be called \\"creative.\\"  As for whether you will think it's good or not is going to be very subjective.  I think there are so many genres here that everybody can find one song they think is good.  Yet few people will really think that every song is good because they are all over the place.  And fewer still will think that this is a great album because there really isn't a \\"stand-out\\" song here.<br /><br />\\"Electric Feel\\" kind of has a 70s disco feel to it, if an electronic alternative song can have such a feel to it.  Distortions are used on the vocals as with most other tracks, and of course there is a healthy dosage of layering.  I like the multi-layered background instrumentals and beats.  This is probably the most \\"radio-friendly\\" song here.<br /><br />\\"Time To Pretend\\" is perhaps my favorite song on this album.  It has a great sound that feels like it could have been on the [[ASIN:B000MGUZM0 Neon Bible]] album that made Arcade Fire so huge last year.  \\"The Youth\\" is a similar sort of song.<br /><br />\\"Kids\\" kind of has that driving beat that [[ASIN:B000GUK5U4 The Killers]] love to play over.<br /><br />\\"4th,\\" \\"Of Moons,\\" \\"The Handshake\\" and \\"Future Reflections\\" all start out with a kind of mellow feel that does fit for the album, though some of the songs diverge.  Still, none of these tracks really stands on it's own as a bona-fide hit.<br /><br />The Flaming Lips have some awesome concept albums, but even they had hit songs on them.  This feels like a concept album without a center.  Certainly good, but it could have been better.  I am looking forward to the next one to see what they come up with.<br /><br />This is definitely one that has to be listened to carefully and multiple times.  This is not an easily accessible album.  Still, if you like experimentation and ecclectic mix of alternative styles, you will find something to enjoy here.<br /><br />So give this a try.  :)<br /><br />Enjoy.nd ecclectic mix of alternative styles, you will find something to enjoy here.

B000VFGSI2|5.0|This was the first classical music recording I remember hearing. I was four years old at the time and I was hooked. 37 years later it is still a favorite. It is true that Gould's performances of these works are unorthodox to say the least, but give the man some credit; his performances work. I am glad that Sony has re-issued this album with its original cover.

Even my boyfriend admitted it was pretty darn impressive (that is amazing in itself!)  ENJOY!
1567184855|3.0|To be honest I got about 2/3 done and put it down. The information put forth is rather interesting.    Being based on the concept of reincarnation, the problem I found is this.    How can it be that these people were born in essentially the same English environment? Sort of like the \\"Star Trek Syndrome\\" where all the aliens speak English. One would think that it very likely that a good portion of these people would be reincarnated from other nations and vastly different times...But they aren't. If they were, under hypnosis as it were...They should be able to speak fluently in their native tongue right?    I don't know all the answers and questions like the above make me scratch my head and wonder as to the validity of these claims. Maybe more explination needs to be given on this mechanic because I just don't get it. Not saying its false, just not evidence at hand to buy into it.     But as far as I got it was an entertaining read.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow!  I've purchased many workouts before but this one is one of the best.  Usually, I jump right to the advanced part, but I haven't gotten past level 1 and I've already lost over 5 pounds in 2 weeks.  This is saying a lot for me because I've been struggling in the last year after having 2 9lb babies within 13 months of one another - both delivered C-section.  That put me about 60 pounds over my normal weight.  Before I bought the workout I had lost a lot of it, but I couldn't lose those last 10 pounds.  Now it's finally coming off and this workout has helped me back into my pre-pregnancy clothes.  I'm really impressed with how effective this workout is for only 20 minutes a day.  Great job, Jillian and thanks!
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|When I first heard sound samples of this CD I thought\\"dumb.\\"  However in a store one day I broke down  and bought it for a lark.  I heard it all the way through and some of the songs caught my interest.  This CD definitley targets the younger set with its hip hop melodies and simple lyrics.  No doubt that there are catchy songs here but nothing that will be remembered in six months from now.  This CD is truly a flavor of the moment.  My favorit song is \\"Miles Away\\" which is the most adult oriented song on the album.  Other tracks I enjoy are \\"Incredible\\" and \\"Dance tonight.\\"  \\"Spanish Lesson\\" is easy on the ear as well as \\"Give it to me.\\"  What I don't understand is why some songs suddnely change tempo halfway through?  It seems like the engineers snorted a little something and decided to go crazy at the last minute.  Madonna says it best in \\"Give it to me\\" \\"Get stupid,\\" and that's what some of the songs sound like.  Yeah, I guess it's all right for a night on the floor but anyone who thinks this is true music has got to get his ears checked.  So I'll spin it now and again, even sing a long but probably it will fade from my play list in a few months.  Try as she might, Modonna will always be remembered for her earlier work which she was actually saying something rather then repeating candy floss lyrics to the beat of eletronic popcorn  sound effects.

B001453LX8|4.0|I like this album.  Most of the songs were good, not mind blowers like some that she has had in the past.  I really like 4 songs on the album, the rest are just ok.  My favorite Badu album is Mama's Gun.      I think that Erykah took her leanings to be more experimental and merged them with what her traditional (Baduizm) fans would like to hear.  But I say she should follow her inclinations and see where they lead.  I did not like every song on the album, but I don't have that expectation.  If artist don't change and test the market then they will never grow.  Instead of people complaining that her album is not the \\"same Erykah\\"... they will compain that it's the \\"same old Erykah\\".  Artist have to complete a project and then they have to sing the same songs at hundreds of events during a year and sometimes for years if the song becomes a hit.  So just like everyone else has asperations to grow, improve, and incorporate change into their jobs... I would say that it is reasonable for artists to feel the same way.      Therefore, I would recommend the album, but only to those that listen to something other than the same old stuff you hear on the radio - traditional R&B and traditional \\"Neo-Soul\\".  Neo-Soul was new over 10 years ago.  She was one of the pioneers then, I think she will continue to be a leader in bringing us new music, if we let her.

This was one of those books. It's well written, so unique, and really carries a message. However, I will warn you. This is about the hardest book to put down. I read it in a couple days and I can't count the number of times I was late for something because I just couldn't bring myself to close it.     I would recommend this book to anyone. I can't really put it into words, but it really is great. However, it's definitely more of a teen book, because it does have a little bit of questionable stuff in it, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone too young.    You HAVE to read it.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Kevin Smith's first movie in \\"The Jersey Trilogy\\" is arguably still his all-time best! Shot in Black & White on a low budget, it features content over flash.  It chronicles a day in the life of Dante Hicks, a convenience store clerk who gets called in to work on his day off.  His friend Randall Graves works at the low-rate video store across the way.  Randall is a bitter, cynical young guy who doesn't like or respect anyone or anything (except maybe hermaphorditic porn).  Through all his trials in this day, Dante keeps whining his tag phrase, \\"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\\"  This movie was everyone's first introduction to the characters, Jay and Silent Bob.  Writer/director Kevin Smith is excellent in the role of Silent Bob.  J & SB are great as minor, background silly, obscene characters to lighten the plot (which is brilliant...but even this heavily real comedy benefits from the comic relief).  But in other movies where Kevin has tried to feature J & SB as main characters (such as \\"Mallrats\\", \\"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\\"), the plots get silly, juvenile and aimed at teenagers.  This is a more mature and real comedy aimed at adults.  Please, Kevin.......for the sake of the part of your audience that has a brain, keep Jay and Silent Bob as minor side characters in all upcoming flicks.  This is a stark, vulgar, real comedy that looks at life from the vantage point of someone who has grown up a little.  It's funny, because it's real.  Kevin's co-producer Scott Mosier also takes 2 small roles in the film.  Mosier plays a stoner who is knicknamed Snowball because of a sex practice he likes.  Scott also plays an irate customer who gets mad that Dante closed the store to play hockey on the roof.  This irate customer bullies his way into the game.  And when Dante gets fined for selling cigarettes to small children (even though he's innocent?) and a college girl accidentally has sex with a dead guy in the bathroom, the authorities are left to wonder, \\"What kindof a store are you running here, anyway?\\"  There is nothing dirty or nasty that happens on-screen.  But due to adult language and frank discussions of adult subjects, this film is not for general audiences.  With the possible exception of \\"Chasing Amy\\", this is by far Kevin Smith's best film (and that includes all 5 or 6 flicks that comprise \\"The Jersey Trilogy\\"), because it is vulgar and raw and very real.  Clerks has become one of my all-time favorite comedies!  In one word:  Brilliant!
0345441184|1.0|I read this years ago and while I don't exactly want to fling it across the room, I was extremely let down.   It is vivid and the characters are memorable.   Unfortunately what I remember about them is that they are all shambling wrecks of humanity.   The main character is weak and indecisive.   She allows herself to be manipulated and blown by whatever comes, never making a stand, never deciding what she truly believes or acting to get what she wants.   I am mystified that this is somehow seen as feminist.
B000GX57YK|1.0|I ordered a new HD-DVD, and the one I received was significantly scratched...so much that it would not play properly.

B000JMKSE2|5.0|Smart, relevant, and on point, this book is a good read for anyone interested in the evolution of product valuing and Internet-based business modeling. Part social and cultural review, part business process review, it speaks to how gone are the days of company driven, long-lasting big hits, which where primarily created from limited availability of information about people and entertainment products.  The digital world of the Internet has created microcosms of connoisseurs who are reshaping what's considered popular, which is, in turn, reshaping Internet-based company business models and revenue sources.  In a digital world, more product can be made available with far less overhead because it doesn't take up physical space.  What the Long Tail says is that this allows a broader range of purchasing options to the consumer, which then results in increased revenue even if a given song, for example, is only purchased by a mere few people.

B0013FNC38|5.0|There's obviously something about May: it was about this time last year that I first heard Amy Winehouse' \\"Back to Black\\"; and it was in May of 2005 that I discovered \\"Begin to Hope\\" by Regina Spektor.  And now, after nearly five months of wondering when someone was going to release an album that might help make life worth living at this apocolyptically unsettled time, comes Jason Mraz with one of the catchiest, cleverest, most joyful albums I've heard in a very long time.<br /><br />I almost wish I could find some fault with this album, because really, how many five-star reviews should one album receive?  But what can I do?  This album makes nary a mis-step.  Artistically, this is his \\"Court and Spark\\"; and if there were any justice in the universe, it would be his commercial equivalent of \\"Tapestry\\".  But if Rufus Wainwright is the Joni Mitchell of the late-20s-early-30s set, Jason Mraz is the mythological love child of Michael Franks and Kenny Rankin (with Paul Simon, Al Jarreau and maybe Kanye West as his fairy godfathers).  Oh -- and that's a GOOD thing.  Thank god for May!
B00005JLPK|4.0|I recently read an article in the New York Review of Books (May 15, 2008) analyzing the work of the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo that reminded me how much I liked this film, especially the performance by Ms. Hayek (who received an Oscar nomination for her efforts and who bore a striking resemblance to Frida in the film). The gist of the article, which included some biographical detail that is also explored here (her various severe mental and physical problems, his stormy relationship with her fellow artist and husband the world famous muralist Diego Rivera, her bisexuality), is that while much of Kahlo's artistic work reflected her strong psychic attachment to Mexico it also placed her squarely in the camp of naturalist painters.     I am not enough of an art devotee to make comment on that above mentioned critique, however, from the several paintings of Kahlo's that I have seen I would argue a little more toward the surrealist school that virtually every Mexican artist in the 1920's and 1930's drew from as they created their work. But enough of that argument for now. This film, in its own round about way, by presenting the various psychic pains (failure to have the children she desperately wanted, her topsy- turvy relationship with Rivera as she tries to make her own space in the art world and the underlying tensions of combining politics and artistic endeavor) gives a fairly decent gloss, for a commercial film, on the trials and tribulations of being a Mexican woman artist in the early part of the 20th century.    Of course, for this political junkie and admirer of Leon Trotsky the names Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera conjure up political connections as much as art. One of the strands working its way through the film is this couple's relationship with the exiled Trotsky when President Cardenas granted him a visa in 1937. All sources that I have read and photographs that I have seen have mentioned that Trotsky was smitten with Frida's exotic beauty (to the furor of hiscompanion, Natalia). However, it was rather startling to watch the episode where Trotsky jumps into bed with Ms. Kahlo. I have noted elsewhere that the old time revolutionaries, especially the Russians, were extremely reticent about discussing personal sexual matters in their memoirs and autobiographies. Trotsky was no exception. Is that scene merely cinematic license or was Trotsky really just a dirty old man? You decide. I will concentrate of his political wisdom. And Frida's strangely exotic paintings.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|After her drug-dealer father and family are murdered, 12 year-old Matilda (Natalie Portman) is effectively adopted by Leon (Jean Reno), the nice man in the apartment next door who just happens to be a hit-man. Leon then proceeds to teach Matilda his trade so that she can exact revenge on her family's killers.    \\"Leon\\" is one of the most unusual films that I have ever seen and also one of the best. Without a doubt, it is the best of Luc Besson's films. In a video store, this film would probably be placed in the action section, but although it contains a number of (very violent) action scenes, I don't really see this film as being an action film in the same sense that something like \\"Die Hard\\" is. It is more a study of the relationship between Leon and Matilda, and a very good one at that. Leon and Matilda are two extremely damaged people who manage to find love (albeit platonic love) with each other. The fact that they find this love through activities that most people would consider to be less than desirable just adds to this film's charm. It is also a study of innocence, contrasting Leon's child-like nature (the look on Reno's face as he watches a Gene Kelly movie is priceless) with that of an actual child.    Everything about this film is excellent. From Besson's script and directing to Reno, Portman and Gary Oldman as the film's three leads. Although made in English with mostly American actors (except for Reno, who, bizarrely, plays an Italian) and targeted at the American/International market, this is, in fact, a French film and is stylistically more European than American, and in my opinion, is all the better for it. I just saw this film for the second time last night and I already want to re-watch it. I cannot recommend this film enough.
B00006DEFA|1.0|This version of \\"Amadeus\\" was fabulously disappointing. The writing in the extra scenes are atrociously bad. They don't flow at all and they are so badly written they make what was left in the theatrical version look bad. It's amazing to see how they made a Best Picture out of this movie.     The extra scenes are also dull, obviously written to flesh out a plot that didn't need fleshing out- you can infer everything these scenes add, or, make your own interpretation of Salieri's motivations and character. In this way, the scenes insult the intelligence of the viewer. And they're boring too! They slow the pace of the movie down, and it's far less exciting. That's something the theatrical version did well - it was very exciting.    For people who know the original well, you're not missing anything with the Director's Cut.    For people who have never seen Amadeus, at least see the theatrical version first.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|You know, I enjoyed this entire series, in all of it's goofiness (even part 12) but this one really takes some stretches from the plausibility of reality.  I mean, a giant super-computer that reads the player's heart-rates, or Ellen Barkin becoming a ravenous, drooling idiot, or the hotel inspector plagued by every conceivable problem (and what exactly was his point in the sceme, anyhow?  The gang is there to heist money - why did they have to torment this guy, anyhow?)<br />The only highlight for me was the wacky sub-plot at the impoverished Mexican dice manufacturing plant.  I thought that was a great story idea, and a very creative distraction and contrast from the lights, dazzle and shadow of Vegas.<br />George Clooney and Brad Pitt are just a great pairing in this series, and their dialog just seems so real (a strange thing to say, considering how UNreal this entire series feels.)<br />Worth one viewing, just to see Al Pacino flustered, but that's about it.
B000VI70WM|5.0|Duran Duran still has it going on after all these years. My friends who haven't heard them in years, were surprised at how brillant & progressive Duran Duran continues to be.  Sensual ballads are very much a strong point on this CD, along with new alternative sounding music with a hip hop influence on a couple of songs.  Even my nephew who is into rap, hip hop & heavy metal really gets into the Red Carpet Massacre tune.  When we went to the concert last week at the Nokia Center, the crowd went wild & crazy as they played their new songs, & of course the classic older songs.  They are still hot!
B00006RAKP|3.0|The song \\"Daniel\\" is an inexplicably messed up master that fades out just seconds before the actual ending. Never heard that before... Another reviewer also mentioned that Honky Cat and Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting were edited (early fades). Other reviewers complain about the flat or EQ'd mastering problems. The credits say \\"various songs\\" remastered by Gus Dudgeon - this would explain the uneven quality (unacceptable from a major label like Universal/UTV).  As many have pointed out, this set is missing the #1 hit \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" (unforgivable) as well as the top 10 hits \\"Mama Can't Buy You Love\\" and \\"Empty Garden\\". There's several lame 90's tunes on disc two to make it even worse.  Universal's Gold series has done many new collections that had EVERY hit by major artists - so it can be done.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I was caught up in this fantasy from the very start until the very end.  So many current movies, even the fantasies, have such predictable plots that you can guess what's coming next from miles away.  Not this movie.  From the very start, the plot turns in ways you don't see coming and you find yourself simply following along.    Claire Danes was radiant as the \\"fallen star\\" whose tell-tale shine gives away whatever emotion is in her heart.  Michelle Pfeiffer goes through an amazing transformation from ancient hag to beauty and eventually back to hag again.  Robert DeNiro is a lot of fun as the pirate with the \\"big secret,\\" and it was pretty clear while watching that he had a big time hamming it up in his role, too.    My only disappointment is the initial meeting of Tristan & Yvaine...she whines a great deal about her predicament.  Thankfully that didn't last too long.    A little scary for the smaller children, though.  Parents should use discretion.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|What can I say? The Story is an amazing cd. When a voice like Janis Joplin meets Natalie Merchant is sung with the sound like James Taylor and the Indigo Girls combined, you have nothing but a winner. She's real, she's raw, she's Brandi. From songs like The Story, whose lyrics rip across your heart with love and friendship, to songs that make you miss your old friends even more, like Turpentine, this cd is amazing. The girl's got something, 'nuff said.
1400082773|5.0|This has been a wonderful insight into one of our democratic candidates for the presidential election.  Sen. Obama's writing style is wonderful and I have a much greater awareness of him.  This is an excellent book for every one to read.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|This album is a headbangers gem!!! It features the return of Alex Skolnic and Greg Christian, whose guitar and bass work make this album soar with feroricity!! I've been a Testament fan since the 1989 Practice What You Preach album, and these guys never cease to amaze me. This band has been loyal to it's fans, and has never sold out!! If nothing else each album they come out with keeps getting heavier, and better!! Metallica should take some hints from these guys! This album reminds me of earlier work such as Pwyp and the New Order, and recent work such as The 1999 album The Gathering. Chuck Billy's voice never sounded better, and it's a good thing he won his battle with cancer. This is a brutal thrash metal album not for the faint of heart. The track that stands out for me is The Evil Has Landed, which tells of the horrifying events of 9\11. This album is highly recommended for fans of thrash metal. Thanks Teastament for keeping real metal alive!!
B00154GEFU|5.0|Saw ASIA in concert last year expecting a semi-cheesy 80s band reunion.  Wrong!  They rocked.  Got the new cd when it came out and went to see them again since.  The cd is reflective and the songs really seem to have personal meaning.  I recommend listening to it more than once before you make your decision about it.  I love it.  They are a very talented group of musicians.  Can't wait to see them again!
0307237702|4.0|In this book, Obama comes across as Mondale or Dukakis with a funny name- a nice, cautious man, but not particularly innovative or imaginative.  He is probably a bit more liberal than Clinton, but much less radical than a Kucinich or McGovern or Jesse Jackson.  He reflexively favors a generous government - and this attitude extends to foreign policy; he endorses an increased defense budget to \\"restore readiness and replace equipment\\" after the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.<br /><br />As a literary work, this book is not as interesting as Obama's first book: there's too much campaign rhetoric that could have just as easily have been written by any of his Democratic rivals.  But every hundred pages or so, this book says something that is just a little bit more reflective than I would have expected.  A few examples:<br /><br />*He describes how politicians are pulled towards the positions of their allies and campaign contributors: \\"You ask yourself, just what does good conscience dictate exactly: that you avoid capture by `special interests' or that you avoid dumping on your friends?  The answer is not obvious.  So you start voting as you would answer a questionnaire. You don't ponder your positions too deeply.\\"<br /><br />*A fairly accurate, I think, description of racial prejudice: though whites still hold \\"the stereotypes our culture continues to feed us ... such prejudices are far more loosely held than they once were - and hence are subject to refutation ... A black man may have trouble catching a cab late at night, but if he is a capable software engineer Microsoft will have no qualms about hiring him.\\"<br /><br />*His description of the liberal elitism that he himself has been accused of: \\"academics, journalists and purveyors of popular culture simply failed to appreciate the continuing role that all manner of religious expression played in communities across the country.\\"
B00005JNS0|5.0|I have been forced to watch this movie at least 20 times and I still enjoy everything about it.  The Computer animation is top notch, the soundtrack is great, and all the top of the line actors do a terrific job, with many memorable lines.  My 2 and 4 year old boys love it over and over again.  What's not to like.
B000PDZFCK|3.0|not enough new stuff.  recent research ignored. arrogant and condescending stick is getting old.
B00005JPS7|5.0|With a meteoric rise from first-time film making Marvel Enterprises, we get to see an action-packed, funny, and eye-popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.<br /><br />To start with, IRON MAN needed a great lead character. Tony Stark is known to be cocky, good-looking, and an all-around bad-boy. So who better to inhabit this persona than Robert Downey Jr. ([[ASIN:B000E1NXJ0 Good Night, and Good Luck]]). I think most people know Downey Jr.'s difficulties and run-ins with the law over the past several years, and I could think of no one better to pull off this character than someone who has some of those very same flaws.<br /><br />You also need a good villain, and Obadiah Stane was the perfect stab-in-the-back. Played very well by the surprising Jeff Bridges ([[ASIN:B000KB4898 Tideland]]), I found myself repulsed by his money-mongering ways that Tony (Downey Jr.) wants so badly to be rid of after considering (and witnessing) the human cost.<br /><br />We get a bit of romantic/sexual tension, too, in the form of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, [[ASIN:B00005JNM3 Proof]]), Tony Stark's life secretary. The drop-dead gorgeous dress that Potts wears to a dance and the subsequent almost-kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic-book-to-film venture.<br /><br />Another huge plus for the film is the amazing CGI. Never once will the audience believe they aren't watching real life. This is, in part, thanks to Downey Jr.'s incorporation into these scenes as he tries and often fails to get his Iron Man suit off the ground. It's also hilarious to watch Tony Stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue:<br /><br />Stark: \\"Okay, seriously, I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest...\\"<br /><br />Jimmy: \\"We can talk, sir.\\"<br /><br />Stark: \\"Oh, I see. So it's personal. Alright.\\"<br /><br />Ramirez: \\"You intimidate them, sir.\\"<br /><br />Stark: \\"Good god, you're a woman! I honestly couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.\\"<br /><br />Ramirez: \\"I'm an airman.\\"<br /><br />Stark: \\"Well you actually have excellent bone structure there. I'm having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?\\"<br /><br />This kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.<br /><br />Plenty of times movie-goers have seen films with a lot of action and no substance, but Iron Man happily -- and easily -- gives us both. It's well-deserving of the title \\"blockbuster.\\" And if you really want to see what lay ahead for Iron Man, please stay til after the credits have finished rolling. You'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest...\\"    Jimmy: \\"We can talk, sir.\\"     Stark: \\"Oh, I see. So it's personal. Alright.\\"    Ramirez: \\"You intimidate them, sir.\\"    Stark: \\"Good god, you're a woman! I honestly couldn't have called that.

0452289963|5.0|This book is a manual for living life at another level. It's simple approach to what one needs to do to make life more joyful and less painful works and is easy to understand. It's language is simple, yet beautiful. It reminds us of who we truly are and how by remembering it at each moment we can stay above the turbulences of this physical world. I have read it twice so far and each time found something new. It is good enough to be kept close at all times and to be read over and over again. Then it will become a constant reminder of the divinity of the reader and how one can stay in touch with that higher dimension of oneself. As the world around us gets more chaotic and the level of violance and destruction rises, we all need to hear such words of wisdom from someone who has risen to a higher level of being and is willing to share its magic with us.
B00000JQFM|3.0|JS was highly recommended by a good friend ... unfortunately, I must say \\"Surfing\\" was not initially for me. Maybe with one exception, I just didn't hear any \\"hooks\\" or emotionally memorable tunes. The playing here was technically good but it just reminded me of a bland soundtrack background. Give me Clapton, Guy, Buchanan, Steve Kimock, or Steve Howe anyday. The cd did get better with repeated listenings, but I think I definitely need to check out other JS offerings.  Update:  SEE HIM LIVE, or check out one of his live recordings!
B0001I561E|3.0|My 4 year old really loves this movie up until when they start fighting... then she becomes scared. I think once she's a little older, she might appreciate it more. The content is a bit much for a 4 year old.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Wonderful story line, great adaptation from human reality to \\"Cars\\" reality.  I've watched this with my son over and over again and still find little tid-bits I missed prior.  He loves it and knows all the characters by name now. Highly recommended for kids under 21 (and OVER)
0452287588|5.0|Even though the subject matter was covered before, this book has its own place and has a timely appearance. The book deals with ego and with what happens when we let ego take over our bodies. Nothing new, right? Well, sort of. After reading this book I began to understand better why some people end up where they are (especially career-wise and personally). I can see how uncontrolled ego can turn a person into an amazing jackass. But, what the book helped me to understand better is why living in \\"now\\" is so important, and why suppressing the ego-driven behavior leads to a healthier you. This is the key: whatever we do, our reactions, our choices in life, how we deal with other people, if it is ego-driven, nothing good will come out of it. Of course, there are times when you have to stand up for yourself and your family because we are surrounded with egotistical personalities and they do nothing but aggravate you. But you can win, if you fight smartly.    This book spelled it all out and that's why I think it is important for all of us not just read it, but follow it.
0618918248|4.0|This book was interesting mostly because he shares many of the same views I have about religion.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Great movie, every teenager should watch this one.  A must have movie for every family.
B0016CP3VC|4.0|This is Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's last great album. It was the first one by the original trio since 1978's dismal Love Beach.  Black Moon doesn't match their heyday from 1969-1974, but it's still consistently good and focused.  The title track, Paper Blood, and Affairs of the Heart are standouts here.  I saw them on this tour, and they were really good. Emerson and Palmer were really into the concert (Emerson destroying his organ, and Palmer's drum solo got a standing ovation...when does that happen!).  Lake's voice has gotten deeper here, but it hadn't deteriorated to what it is today.  It isn't as ambitious or as intricate as Tarkus, Brain Salad Surgery, or Welcome Back, but it's still pretty good. You can really appreciate this album considering the follow up, In the Hot Seat, was a royally screwed up mess (Lake and Emerson not getting along, Emerson suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, Lake's voice fading away), that this album is a masterpiece by comparison. After ELP's heyday, they pretty much self destructed, due to the usual rock star garbage (drugs, egos, tired of the road). They broke up rather acrimoniously in 1997, so future reunions and albums are out of the question, so enjoy the last great studio album they ever did.
B000HT386M|5.0|The world is so full of negative emotions, this movie is a good laugh, which we need to do more often.  Good Buy
B0000844I8|3.0|This movie takes place in another world equivalent to Egypt so we see a lot of sand dunes, which isn't really that good to look at, boring scenery. The aliens make good bad guys, and they seem unbeatable, so it's a good underdog story how the natives unite to fight the aliens, with help from the U.S. soldiers. Kurt Russell plays a tragic tough guy, and it comes out as a good character to root for when he fights the aliens. I think overall it's an above average action movie, with a little romance, but the lasting image is that there's a lot of sand.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|My husband watched this movie during one of his Administration in Education classes, he decided to buy it and use it at the high school. He was very impressed with the \\"lessons\\" in the movie, it is worth the watch.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Although I enjoy the next generation series from time to time and enterprise with the difficulties of working within the constraints of a prequel is outstanding, the original holds that special place that the others can't reach. I watched all three seasons within a week and loved every one. I have read some reviews talking about picture quality and I didn't see. I'm not saying it wasn't there just that I didn't notice it at the time.     The price is high overall, but not for what you get. If you break it down it comes $4 a dvd or $1 an episode. Amazon was half the price of best buy and they had only one or two seasons. A better guide of episodes would make going back to favorites much easier. The control panel to choose the episode is not very friendly either.
B000XLU4D4|5.0|How listening to this album takes me back. Several of the tracks on Hey Jude are not available on any other albums. The first two tracks seem out of place, but the rest are a collection of classics written for the ages. Generations have come and gone and these songs are still relevent.<br /><br />The songs on Hey Jude were written and performed between 1964 and 1968. They are still played today on radio stations across the country and the world. We know the tunes and the lyrics and we all have our favorites. The same cannot be said of music in modern times. Songs written as recently as 2003 have disappeared into the great unknown. They will not be played on the radio forty-four years from now and be sung along with by future generations.<br /><br />Hey Jude is an album that is required listening for rock and pop fans as well as hippies of all ages. Open, play, enjoy.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|1. I hate CGI- BRING BACK MODELS! they have mass and look \\"real\\" ie 3D-CGI looks fake,has no 'mass', and looks 2D  2. Why do directors feel the need to add the 'rumble' of a space vehicle as it goes through space-no air in space=no sound;  3. Even more annoying why do they foley in a \\"woosh\\" when something close goes by: ie: the comm towers,  the title BRAVEHEART, going in throught the window at the very start of LES PACTE DES LOUPES, STAR TREKs bottle of Champagne etc etc etc. juvenile    What a great team of actors wasted in a remake of EVENT HORIZON
B000E41MS6|5.0|This is still my favorite series of the new Doctor Who. Christopher Eccleston is mesmerizing as the Doctor, and Billie Piper is at her most charming as Rose. The pair have amazing chemistry despite the age difference - these two obviously work best as a team, whatever the function of that team may be. The addition of John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness is the icing on the cake. The characters are engaging, their relationships are believable, and the sci-fi is pleasantly easy on the brain while allowing the human element to tug on the heart strings just enough to make it stick with you. In a word: FANTASTIC! Of course.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I bought this CD for my Husband. It was packaged well and came within a few days. My Husband was very happy with the CD.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|An absolute classic, timeless and brilliant... witty and dramatic, funny and engaging, starring two of Hollywood's greatest leading men in an unforgettable and magnificently told tale of two of the Old West's most legendary figures. This is more than simply a must-see movie, it is a can't miss, see it time and time again classic!
B0014CQNTK|4.0|I purchased this movie to watch with my teenage daughter. Thought it would be a humorous way of introducing a topic that is actually not so humorous. It was witty, funny, sad all rolled up into one film. I would definitely recommend watching it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is perfect for a quick, no nonsense, total body workout for all fitness levels. The presented exercises allow you to determine the difficulty of your own workout; even those who are incredibly fit can be drippin sweat. It is fun and keeps your interest. I do it every day, alternating the difficulty levels, and felt results in days. Two thumbs up!
1400097029|2.0|Yes, it's beautifully written prose.  Each sentence crafted by an artist.  I suppose that's the fuel behind its winning the Man Booker prize.  But can you really enjoy reading it when you need to consult a dictionary for every other sentence?  This book seems more like an exercise in creating \\"texture\\" rather than plot.  I've never seen so many obscure words spread around, and for what purpose?  About as much fun reading as it is to watch a modern-day spelling bee.
