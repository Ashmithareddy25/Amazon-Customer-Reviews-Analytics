B002KEZ96Y|3.0|Not bad but I never really felt the flow of the plot. Ending was also indecisive. Having said that, the acting was generally good with some funny scenes.
B0089PJFFY|5.0|I am ten, and even at my young age I enjoy this book tremendously. It is amazing to see through writing the life of a teenage Jew during World War II. I find it very inspiring and even if you are young, I think it is absolutely mandatory to read this book sometime throughout your lifetime. I can't put it all in words. Anne Frank is now my absolute favorite person from history. She went through puberty in an Annex, cut off from the outside world, she went  through a hard relationship with her mother, Edith. She recorded her innermost thoughts in her diary, and it is moving and inspirational to read it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It takes a weird turn after the other weird stuff. Pretty unbelievable considering his background. More like a fantasy book instead of a romance. Too hardcore for me.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really liked the scenes into the background of the Gamemaster and seeing a view of how they made things happen.  Missed some of the story from the book but this pretty much made up for the changes.

B00C061I3K|1.0|You wanta know why I love Spotify? Because I can read all these hype articles and hear radio stories about new albums and then go and actually listen to them and say to myself, \\"Man, I'm sure glad I didn't spend twelve bucks on *that*. This is 80s rehash boring boring boring repetitive drum machine/synth/keyboard stuff that sounds as old and quaint as Dixieland by now. If you like it, you have my blessing. But I find it more boring than watching paint dry in a humid climate.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Loved the author's previous novels, however this one left me puzzeled.  Great story at first, but then it veered off into fragmented tales of other characters lives that were only connected to each other  by a thread. The stories left you wanting more.  Some of them just stopped, leaving you to guess what may have happened.

0307730700|5.0|Eric Blehm's Fearless is a book that I reviewed when if first came out.  At that time, I said it was \\"one of the best books I have read in recent memory.  Adjectives that I would use to describe it are:  riveting, inspirational, gutsy, patriotic, and redemptive.\\"  To this day, I stand by that initial review.<br /><br />Coming out in paperback, Blehm has added a new section at the end of the book called \\"Adam's Legacy.\\"  These few pages are selected comments that were sent to the author and/or the Brown family.  These go on to show how powerful an effect this book can have on people.  They provide a nice book-end to the manuscript as evidence of how character can touch other lives.<br /><br />It is rare that I review a book and do not offer any sort of criticism, but, quite honestly, Fearless is one such book.  The author did a masterful job of weaving together the whole story of an American soldier that ultimately gave his all for you and me.  While the writing demonstrates clear skill of the author, the material is rich and engaging for any reader.  Clearly, the compelling life of Adam Brown carries the reader through a roller coaster of emotions and the story does not end with his all-too-soon departure from this earth.<br /><br />The story traces the life of Adam Brown and shows his intense love for his home state of Arkansas.  A reader comes to understand that his character was forged at an early age including his penchant for danger (i.e. reenacting a movie scene of jumping off a bridge from a moving car) and sense of justice.  Somewhere along the way, due to some \\"friends\\" he associated with, Adam was sidetracked through addictions.  The greatest challenge of his life was overcoming that addiction even though he had the woman of his dreams and pursued his life's dream of becoming an elite Navy SEAL.<br /><br />You learn about the rigorous and grueling training that must be endured to become a SEAL team member.  Although training accidents slowed his progress, Adam's determination moved him forward closer to fulfilling his passion.  He had to step back and retrain himself in many areas to overcome those obstacles.  The author interjects some interesting anecdotes about Adam that quickly reveal why others thought so highly of him - all I can say is \\"fire ants\\" and will leave the rest for you.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, Brown's story is one of redemption.  After hitting rock bottom and sitting in jail, he gives his life to Christ and accepts the free gift of salvation.  Yet, the circumstances of his life do not become prosperous and rosy.  He still struggles with his internal demons related to drug addiction, and he faces multiple setbacks along the way of making it onto Seal Team SIX.  Love, commitment, and teamwork ultimately helped him overcome but the struggle still remained.<br /><br />This book is not just for military enthusiasts.  It can be used to help those battling with addictions.  It can be used to teach leadership lessons.  It can be used to engender a better appreciation for our men and women in uniform.  It can be used to show the powerful meaning behind the words often contained in wedding vows:  \\"in good times and bad.\\"  It can be used to impart tough love needed as a parent.  It can be used to encourage those going through difficulties.  It can be used to provide the importance of enjoying every waking moment of life and those that you love.<br /><br />Please, get a copy of this book.  Read it and share it with others - you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection:  I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

B00BOLFRKW|4.0|THis is a good film, the actors play their roles very well and it seems to be fairly historically accurate.  I did feel that it was a bit verbose and dragged out at times.  Still a great film and it is certainly one of the best historical films about President Lincoln.

B008BU75IQ|3.0|While the book was good, I wasn't really happy with the format.  Archer had the reader jumping back and forth between characters and therefore going back and forth in time.  I felt like I was reading things out of sequence, which made a bit of a disappointing ending for a really good series.

B003F5NSTW|1.0|It felt too easy to just blame the demon child, maybe that was because it was all the mother's perspective, but too much emphasis on the 'evil child' in the early years with no give to allow for neglect or attachment issues was an easy way out. Just felt lazy. If you're going to honestly address this issue, give a little more reality to it, don't just blame the demon child and the hapless mother. I was lost at that stage in the book and was not drawn back in. Which was sad, really, maybe I expected too much to begin with.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Well done.  Dark as one might imagine of the period, war, characters.  Never thought for a moment that Lincoln was really Daniel Day Lewis.
B00CW665VI|5.0|OMG, this book was FANTASTIC! Can't remember laughing that much since reading Alice Clayton books. I really enjoyed the writing style from this author. Such a witty, raw, and honest man's POV. And she's a chick! And yes, the sex scenes were scorching hot! I had to take a few breaks from reading to compose myself. I can't wait to read whatever's next from Miss Chase. I highly recommend this gem of a book.

B003QSLW0K|5.0|This movie is bound to be a classic. It explores a family torn apart by tragedy healing and learning what it really means to be a family. When the little ball of alien genetic fury that is \\"stitch\\" comes into the picture the story really gets rolling into some fun, fast paced, hijinks. Even the supporting characters are remarkably memorable.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|good story....kept my interest the whole way through.  Would highly recommend.  I  Looking forward to the rest of the series
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book illustrated a wonderful, heart-breaking, and heart-warming tale. I loved how Hosseini took us through the entire life of each of the characters. The different perspectives and narrators of each chapter truly made it a unique experience and kept the story engaging. At first the different stories and narrations were a little confusing, but once I saw how everything was strung together, I was able to breeze through the book. Another beautifully written novel by Hosseini.
0743454537|4.0|Last week I finished My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult. This was my first Jodi book and had no expectations going in. I liked it a lot, reading it in 5 days, not a record but for a mom with two kids, a husband who I work for, a freelance job, 5 blogs, MySpace and 2 therapists to work my schedule around not too bad.<br /><br />My girlfriend (my personal book club bud) didn't love the book and had a hard time getting through it until the end hence the late review. I really wanted her to finish before I wrote about it.<br /><br />The book is about Anna, a 13 year old girl who was the product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, who has spent her life giving blood, marrow, platelets and more in order to keep her sister Kate alive. The book is about love, sisterhood, family, and controversial medical science. For those who love a court room story, there is a little of that there although as someone who isn't into those kind of reads, it worked for this story.<br /><br />Anna decides to hire an attorney to fight her parents for emancipation and keep the kidney that they have scheduled to remove, or Kate will die.<br /><br />The story was great and one that will hit a nerve with most readers. What do you do if your child is sick and dying but you are told that by having another, you could save her life. I chose not to have a tubaligation for this reason. Before kids I probably wouldn't have thought this was something that was morally correct. After having my babies, I knew there was nothing I wouldn't do for them, including having another baby.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I had a wonderful conversation about morals and what we would do in this situation. We had very different opinions along with one of her daughters who chimed in that she would never want to hear that she was born to save a sibling.<br /><br />I think that depending on which character you are sympathizing with at the moment your morals will change. You can sympathize with the father, the mother, the dying sister, the ignored brother, or 13 year old Anna and understand why they do what they do.<br /><br />My biggest problem and it wasn't so much a problem well into the book was that each character had their own chapters, making them the primary character. I found that I had to keep going back to find out who was who.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and felt a connection to Anna, her father and to her brother Jesse all for different reasons. My heart ached at the end and I think the ending will stay with me longer than I want it to.<br /><br />While trying to find a picture of the book cover, I found out that the movie will be out in 2009 starring Cameron Diaz, Abigail Breslin, Alec Baldwin and Jason Patric. I am so psyched. I love seeing movies that I have already read.ng sister, the ignored brother, or 13 year old Anna and understand why they do what they do.<br /><br />My biggest problem and it wasn't so much a problem well into the book was that each character had their own chapters, making them the primary character.

0553385461|3.0|A Briefer History of Time is a sequel to A Brief History of time. There are two other versions of the original. One updated and the other illustrated. You need not concern yourself with those two unless you are a collector. Those two in between are to this series as the special editions are to Star Wars.<br /><br />Briefer History of time is touted as a \\"less technical\\" version of the original. Technical means \\" having special and usually practical knowledge especially of a mechanical or scientific subject.\\"<br /><br />So the only way to really reduce it to being less technical is to omit certain things. In this case, jargon and mathematics.<br /><br />It is extremely succiant. This is both positive and negative. Being able to relay such complex ideas is not bad. It succeeds in this regard. The negative comes from the fact that the chapters are too short.<br /><br />I am glad to see chapters dedicated to Relativity and Time Travel.<br /><br />This book is not going to be any easier to read than the original, though. Again, you are dealing with complex topics.<br /><br />This book is an amazing supplement to the orginal, which you should still read along with this book. Personally, I find the original more to my liking.<br /><br />This is a very fine book and worth the buy.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|What a great series! Cannot wait for what is next!<br />This was the best book I have read this year.

B009ZTSPCC|5.0|With that said, i have been an Aerosmith fan since i heard their sefl titled album on tape when i was a kid in the early 90's. I love all of their albums (except rock in a hard place) and this album defiantly lives up to my expectations. If you havent dove into Music From Another Dimension yet here are a few of my favorate tracks. Oh Yea, Beautiful and We All Fall Down. Its a fun Aerosmith album with a lot of rock and a lot of heart. Dont be a critic of one of the greatest bands in music history. Get this album sick back and enjoy. This Deluxe Version comes with 4 bonus tracks and a bonus DVD featuring 3 live persormances, a music video for Oh Yea, a conversation with Steven Tyler and Joe Perry and interviews with the whole band. Get this 3 disc set while you can.

B0052AC8C6|5.0|Nice message and cute characters. Nice movie to watch with the entire family. Plus it was free on amazon prime.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Primarily because my expectations were so low I streamed this on my computer.  There was roughly zero character development and even less discernible plot.<br /><br />The Ice Giants, the sole antagonists, are more than worthy of a backstory that would've fueled a much more compelling plot.<br /><br />This movie at times (Anthony Hopkins scenes) engages, but more often than not (non-Anthony Hopkins scenes) - simply falls flat with a whisper quiet thud.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story was typical in the sense you heard it before. Woman leaves abusive husbands, finds love, husband returns and makes thing difficult. However Sparks makes these stories personal, shows dimensions and adds twist like Jo. Overall I loved the story. Great read despite the typical story of  an abused run away wife.

B00CLOTNLK|5.0|I came to find out about Sound of Contact not because of Genesis, but because I am also a recent fan of Simon Collins having picked up his album U-catastrophe and I happened to be on his emailing list.  I also had the pleasure of meeting Simon at a Marillion Convention in March.  I didn't notice that they were an opening band for Marillion and when I was watching them I was thinking to myself the drummer was the guy who played Phil in the most famous Genesis tribute band; Canada's \\"The Musical Box\\", but as he left the drums to sing it hit me; that's Phil Collins's kid!  The similarities between Simon and his father are uncanny from drumming to singing.  The new Album Dimensionaut is, yes, a concept album, and yes a progressive rock album, but believe it or not, there are many radio friendly songs: Not Coming Down, Closer to You, Pale Blue Dot, Only Breathing Out, and Remote View come to mind.  The rest of the songs are quite progressive and harken to Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel, Hogarth era Marillion, and who am I forgetting, oh yeah, Genesis.  The best song (in my opinion) on an album of very good songs is Beyond Illumination.  The influence of Peter Gabriel is strong here and with the addition of Hannah Stobart it harkens back to Gabriel and Kate Bush duets in the `80's and Simon's voice and singing style seems to fit smack dab in the middle of Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. I don't want to just focus on Simon as it's apparent Dave Kerzner is also a driving force in the band. He is quite talented on keyboards and has that uncanny ability to compliment Simon's heavy drumming that gives this album the hard edged feeling of a rock band with the orchestral element that most Progressive Bands have.  This album is a must have for Progressive Rock fans, but I also feel any lover of Rock Music and true musicians will enjoy this album.

B00COGXX7A|3.0|I read the book and was excited to see the movie.  I loved the book.  I thought the actors did a good job of matching my impressions of the main characters in the book.  But, maybe the movie directors, producers, and even actors care only about the bottom line (revenue) and could care less about integrity, substance, or following the writer's book. (What happened to Alex's grey hair??) Maybe the writer should be questioned about why he sold out.  He gave the movie moguls free reign.  I know little can be done in under 2hrs (normal movie length).  But, I came away from the movie feeling cheated.  Not by Julianne Hough, Josh Duhamel, Mimi Kirkland, Noah Lomax, or Cobie Smulders.  The entire cast was great. They did what they were directed to do and are all good at what they do.  I just dislike the idea of being fed BS for what I though was a very good novel. Maybe I should stick to reading books and leave the movies on the shelves.

B009YN2M7S|5.0|I was involved with the characters from the 1st page through the last.  Sparks has the gift of telling a story from within the story.  It is like he has walked in each character's shoes.  I will read the rest of his works based on my experience with this read.

When you have finished the movie it will<br />leave you with a good feeling!
052118939X|5.0|A good grammar book for Spanish people who are learning English. This book is very usefull. I recommend it for English students.
0547995660|3.0|Although well written, this book MUST NOT be available or required of a pre=teen to young teen.  I would suggest it be restricted to adults only-those beyond college also as today's college persons do not appear to have the discerning ability to process the content.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|As with Sean Carroll's previous books, this was enjoyable and easy to read for me as an informed layman with an interest in science. Both times the Large Hadron Collider made major announcements about their Higgs findings, I was awake in the early mornings, watching the live video stream from Geneva. If these are the sort of events that hold your interest, then The Particle at the End of the Universe is for you.<br /><br />Even though this book is meant for non-scientists, Dr. Carroll doesn't talk down to you, and he flashes some of the deadpan humor that he uses in lectures. That said, you should have some knowledge of the subject material to read this book (and the fact that you're reading these reviews suggests that you probably do).<br /><br />The book starts out with a history of discoveries that led to this point, and anecdotes about some of the giants and characters on whose shoulders Dr. Carroll and other particle physicists now stand. It then goes into the nitty-gritty of explaining how the mechanisms work, and how the Higgs boson becomes the last piece of the Standard Model. The book has a handful of diagrams that are zoomable and easy to see on the iPad and iPhone Kindle readers.<br /><br />The third part of the book is a strong defense of making -- and paying for -- scientific research for its own sake, even when no practical applications are apparent. If you always want to know \\"Where is my jet pack?\\", he tells you that's not what these discoveries are about. But you never know.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Some really dark stuff, but well-conceived and very well-executed. Flynn knows how to build and release tension masterfully and her characters are complex and real.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Thank you everyone who suggested I read this book! I recommend that everyone read it! If you don't find yourself in the pages somewhere, you're not paying attention.<br /><br />At 63 I have all the menopausal garbage going on in my life. The greatest problem isn't the hot flashes. The worst is feeling stupid. Yeah, I know we all try to laugh at those 'senior' moments but I feel the drain of intelligence with each passing year. I know I used to have a vocabulary to be proud of. Now if I can stay within third grade level writing I am lucky. Watching Charlie grow from the operation to a higher than normal IQ and then crashing back to somewhere near where he was in the beginning is heart-breaking, yet exciting.<br /><br />The book continues to be an inspiration all the way through, no matter what Charlie's IQ is. We learn of how people treat other people. If a person isn't like us then they aren't a person? If this doesn't make you stop and think how your treat everyone I don't know what would! It might not be a person of low intelligence. It might be an older person, a child, a veteran -- someone stops flowing with the traffic around them, swimming upstream or stopped completely. Give them a friendly smile. Care, for goodness sake!<br /><br />The author wrote this using the vehicle of 'Progress Reports' so you can see through Charlie's eyes all the way through this experiment. What a great way to tell the story. And yes, bring the Kleenex. Now I have to go find the movies.

044024613X|4.0|This novel kept getting better as I got deeper into the book.  There was one point I was so into this book that I read almost 200 pages in one sitting because I needed to know what was going to happen next.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining read that isn't to hard to get through.  The main character is put in a controversial situation and forced him to decide whether or not to put his family first above everything else, including his career<br /><br />This novel started off a little slow in the beginning but finished off strong.  This is a solid book for the collection.

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|If you have your kids try this game after watching \\"Finding Nemo\\", watch out! They'll be addicted. The aquatic theme is really cute and the little crabs dragging out items to match is pretty funny. The gameplay itself relies much on different varieties of matching. Sometimes it's shapes, sometimes it's different items that start with a certain letter. Teaching with a fun mechanism like this is a great way to start educating kids before they ever walk into a classroom. Early development of verbal comprehension skills is known to be associated with later success in school, so finding a fun way to help them with that is critical. I highly recommend this one.
B00742GBDM|5.0|Great Movie!!!  I wasn't looking for anything in particular however the previews caught my attention. Would highly recommend it to anyone who liked Pride & Prejudice and movies alike.
0762434279|5.0|The neat thing about this book is that is not the size of the book that matters, is the practicality of if it that permit you to take it with you and read it any time that you have to spare.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was always a big fan Google Reader and their simple, uncluttered layout. But Feedly is a well designed app that makes my blogroll beautiful and fun to scroll through, without adding any clutter. It's very easy to use, and the in-app web browser works very well.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My seven-year old loves this set.  Good value for money, with lots of little pieces to make for a fun playtime.  She loves the animals that come in the set, and also the jewels that can be hidden behind a sliding door. Great tree house platform (love the telescope for spotting visitors!)
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This app has more free effect options than some others that I've used recently, and there are ways to fade and boost them, which is nice. The control features for adjusting the filters aren't the most intuitive, but they were easy to use once I got the hang of it. I would  definitely recommend this!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It is interesting how captivated you get while reading it. Very good writing. You feel inside the character's head. i Recommend it for sure.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The kids absolutely love this game. Make sure it is on a device youwill not have to use frequently. Because you may not get it back from them.
B00BPXKWGS|2.0|I'm giving a cautious and somewhat annoyed review here. The extra concert is nice and reason for some to buy, but it is not entirely complete, and even the Record Store Day EP that was limited does NOT complete the entire concert. Absolutely absurd.<br /><br />This one has some overly loud tracks. If I were you I would hunt down the DVDA version with high-res audio. This one sounds a little crushed. Why are these guys making REM records DR5 on certain songs I have no idea. We do have volume knobs. Would I buy this? No, because I have the better DVDA version. And yes it is miles better in sound.<br /><br />The original is DR12 overall. The DVDA is about the same and sounds absolutely phenomenal, the best it will EVER sound except for.... wait for it: The HDtracksversion of this very same 25th set has much higher dynamic range. For whatever reason they decided to crush the CDs, which basically only collectors are buying anyway, and then they put out an HDtracks version with full dynamic range. Yeah, that makes sense.<br /><br />I'm actually really disgusted how the REM catalogue has been remastered. It's been a horrible experience. While Murmur and Document were louder they sounded good still. After that Fables was crushed into oblivion, Pageant was very loud and obnoxious sounding, and the rest kind of followed suit all the way up until the Warner years.<br /><br />To explain: I have no problem with compression. The Murmur and Reckoning remasters have compression but still managed to stay listenable and sounded great to my ears for the most part.<br /><br />Fables was next to awful with weird EQ and way too much compression. Sadly, one of my favorite albums, Lifes Rich Pageant, was also treated like this.<br /><br />From Fables to Out of Time the newest remasterings are way too hot. Both Capitol and Concord totally screwed this band as far as sound quality and for no good reason. It's pretty terrible that a small label like Concord is applying this level of mastering to the new discs. It's pointless. It serves no purpose at all. None of these songs are going to be on the radio. So why pump up the volume to absurd heights?<br /><br />For this release I highly recommend you go to HDtracks and just get the 24-192 download as it has a lot more dynamic range for whatever reason. If you want the packaging it is pretty decent on this release but nothing that special.ll. None of these songs are going to be on the radio. So why pump up the volume to absurd heights?

B009VA1FN6|4.0|Very absorbing and well written. I highly recommend this book. I will be looking for more from this excellent author.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This CD is listened to at least once a day. The music is great and that heavenly voice....... Susan Boyle is one of my all time favorite singers.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Great film that modernizes Iron Man's story (comic fans know his original story is from the '60s). No complaints at all. The movie is great, the packaging is cool, the extras are great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had to finish the trilogy. This book was hard to understand but as you place yourself in her shoes you cry. The emotions are so strong and real. Simply amazing trilogy.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I loved the movie since seeing in theaters, but a lot of fans didn't. The directors cut I believe has enough changes to appease them. It gives a darker, grittier feel to the film and I dare say crossed boundaries that put it on par with the new Batman trilogy. Daredevil essentially is a blind Batman, lots of fun.
B00821OX98|5.0|it is a good show and i want two season 2  also<br />we need more good syfy movies sense all the star gates and star trek movies quit
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This show is captivating. I love the characters, the history, the setting, the accents, and the humor. Makes me wish I could have experienced life in the early 20th century firsthand.

B007WFR1C6|5.0|This is a clear vinyl 2 disc release. The album reminds me of Demanufacture at times. If you want the CD, buy the standard version. The deluxe has a story line which is cool, but the two extra tracks are not really very good.
0765325950|5.0|Don't worry, I am not going to give any spoilers about the book. Like most people I have been waiting years to read this book and it does not disappoint.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is fun and actually took me a little while to solve. Does anyone know if there is a second one?
B005544TRQ|5.0|Snappy dialogue, fun to watch, and it doesn't hurt that there are some pretty people on the cast. Definitely entertaining.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This app is so awesome you can make a giant hungry rainbow beaver I love this app. Worth 99 cents.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|While it was a horrific story and ordeal, the book is written in such an honest way that it reminds us to know our neighbors without causing an abundance of fear. Congrats to her for being able to tell her story.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Always gripping.  The only disappointment I find in Mr Hosseini`s novels is the fact that they end.  Love love love the way so many lives intertwine so seamlessly.  Can't wait for the next one!

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love the game, but I wish you could buy Dozer Dollars with coins.  After completing so many levels, there's nothing else to goal for, you've done everything, reached 9 &amp; more levels on each prize, so now it gets boring.
B00BESNKB8|4.0|Considering the connection the Wu-Tang Clan tried to establish with the whole Saturday afternoon Kung-Fu theater thing, I was not sure what to expect. Throw in a dash of Tarantino and I was still skeptical. I was however pleasurably surprised that the movie was done in that tradition of Shaw Brothers &#34;Peking Ballet&#34; and was very enjoyable. Lot's of scenes from other classics (Man Called Hero, Hero, Crouching Tiger, Come Dine with Me) gave the movie an old -school field. The use of rap & hip-hop in the soundtrack also caught me off guard on how well it worked in a Kung-Fu movie. I think fans of the genre will be entertained and it might get some new recruits as well.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is my favorite game ever. I literally go on it everyday an d like every s ok angle second of the day.  Luv this game so much! And how we can make memes.<3
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This movie was well done. It treated a very difficult topic well. I am glad that I rented it and I would recommend it to others.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Not an easy game. It requires some thought. Very fun game that you can't give up on. Great graphics. Good luck to all!
B00B0A5XQU|5.0|I enjoyed reading about other residents on Blossom Street.  They invite you in and you feel invested in the neighborhood.  A good summer time read.
B004XQO90E|4.0|A man wakes up on a train, disoriented and unsure why he's there. A cute woman sitting across from him chats with him while a passerby spills her drink on his shoe. He doesn't quite know what's going on and excuses himself. Things become clearer when he looks in the bathroom mirror and sees another guy's face. Well, sort of clearer. Pretty soon the train explodes, killing him, the cute woman, and everyone else on board. You'd think that would be the end of the movie, but it is only the beginning.<br /><br />The guy is suddenly in a harness in a dark room. He's suspended in front of several monitors. A woman's voice talks to him, trying to find out what happened, then trying to get him to remember himself. The guy is really Coulter Stevens, a U.S. Army helicopter pilot now works on a secret government project. They've been able to link him to the last memories of a man who died on a Chicago train early that morning. They are using that link to find the bomber, since the bomber has threatened to strike again, and soon. The army scientists send him back to the moment when he wakes up on the train in hopes that he can discover the bomber and his next target.<br /><br />The premise is intriguing, both the mystery on the train and the whole operation trying to unravel that mystery. The joy of the film is in finding out what is going on, especially with Stevens. The twists in the story are good though some are predictable. The end of the film is suspenseful, but not in the best way. The outcome seems (to me) a little arbitrary. Not that it does not make sense; it could go one of many ways, any of which are just as likely as the others. The movie stuck with me for days thinking about it, but in a very good way. The movie is a solid sci-fi thriller that I would watch again.

1401322786|3.0|I love Mr Albom's books. Couldn't wait to get a copy. I had a family emergency so I finally just got to read it.<br />I felt at times I couldn't put it down.The subject matter unique. I knew from his book &#34;Five people you meet in heaven&#34; (my favorite) the story would all come together if I pushed on. The characters were interesting but towards the end I felt let down. Another review called it &#34;cheesy at the end&#34; I respect this author so much I hate to agree!
B001NAT05W|5.0|Great picture amazing special effects! I recommend this movie especially to Halle Berry fans she's smoking hot in this picture.
B004GTLFNW|4.0|This book is full of knowledge for exercising using your own bodywieght. The approach of increasing/decreasing intensity is a vital part of this approach and the book does a good job explaining how to go about it.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|This is a difficult novel to adapt but filmmakers did a halfway decent job. Too many characters diluted the drama, great cinematography setting mood.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing it is better than temple run they are both similar but truthfully I would go for subway surfer I gave this game 5 stars
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app is great it is everything like YouTube except for me sometimes when I watch a video that bar that tells u the time of the video is all the way like it is finished but the video is still going and the screen is black and I have to turn it off and on so it will work again it sounds like a lot of work but it's not it just gets me mad
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the more intelligently written series w/interesting cases presented along with personal intrigue. Leaves you wanting to find out what's next. Really appreciate that this is a good program without the foul language and blatant sex so prevalent today.
B005OK721G|5.0|Its a fun action movie. . .but to compare it to The Professional is hype.  The Professional is an awesome film and this is a fun action movie.

B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Every year during the first weekend of June, residents of the Central New York community of Chittenango, NY hold a three day Oz festival - now called Oz-Stravaganza! - to pay their respects to L. Frank Baum and to celebrate his classic tale, `The Wizard of Oz.' Is there a better way to pay your own respects to one of the greatest American fairy tales of all time than by reading the book?<br /><br />Baum was born in Chittenango, so it is natural for the community to claim him as a native son.  A portion of Genesee Street in Chittenango contains a replica of yellow brick.  The section used to be a real yellow brick road, but the winters of Central New York made upkeep too much of a headache.  The highlight of the Oz Fest is the parade on Saturday afternoon, where you can get your fill of lions and tigers and bears, oh my!<br /><br />Hollywood has as much to do with the legacy of the story as Baum, because people remember the songs from the 1939 movie better than they remember the novel.  \\"We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz.\\"<br /><br />You should certainly see the movie, but that does not obviate reading the book.  The book gives the reader a better appreciation for a theme of the novel:  There's no place like home.  The Great American Prairie was a dreary place in the decade before the novel was published, whether it was in South Dakota where Baum lived for a while, or in Kansas, where the novel takes place.  Yet Baum found a way to deliver such a message without alienating its residents by having Dorothy insist that there was no place like home, even as Baum contrasted the lush surroundings of the land of the Munchkins with the dullness and grayness of Kansas.<br /><br />Winged Monkeys, Golden Caps, Wicked Witches, hammerheads, and a Tin Woodman are either important characters or powerful artifacts in the story.  Most of the dialogue comes from talking lions, scarecrows, mice and storks. This is a fantasy story where it is best to let things be,rather than question their veracity.  A strong dose of incense from those poppy fields might be just what the reader needs to get in the proper mood for this story.<br /><br />The central characters are Dorothy from Kansas, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion.  Dorothy is followed by her faithful companion, Toto, who is one of the few animals that do not talk in the novel. All four are on a quest for something that they ultimately have within themselves.<br /><br />The novel is in the public domain, so you can download it for free at Project Gutenberg.  It is also available for free at the Toshiba Book Place, so you can test out their product if you are so inclined.  It is free here too.  The novel was written for children, so the adult reader might find some of the broad strokes painted by Baum simplistic.  Yet the novel, which moves quickly and ends suddenly, contains some profound themes that make it worthwhile to read.  It is one of the great American fairy-tales of all time.

0982954328|5.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote `The Hounds Of the Baskervilles' eight years after Holmes had disappeared, and was presumed dead, at the Reichenbach Falls near Meringien, Switzerland.  Rather than resurrect Holmes, Doyle presented his newest case as one from the notes of Dr. John Watson when they were first roommates at 221B Baker Street.  The novella was released in serial form through publication in Strand from 1901-1902 and packaged as a novel in 1902.  Doyle would resurrect Sherlock Holmes a few months later.<br /><br />Holmes began his work on this case investigating clues in London. In typical Holmes fashion, he is able to deduce operating assumptions from seemingly meaningless clues.  For example, Sir Henry Baskerville receives a warning clipped from words from a newspaper.  Holmes was able to identify the exact article from which the words were clipped, and he sent the Baker Street Irregulars to investigate the trash of all the hotels in London, to see where the newspaper was disposed.  The Irregulars were explained in [[ASIN:1420925644 The Sign of the Four]].<br /><br />Sir Henry bought a pair of new tan boots, to dress the part of an English Squire, and had one of them stolen.  The next day, the tan boot was returned but one of his older boots had been stolen.  Holmes deduced from these two incidents, seemingly prankish, indicated he was not dealing with the supernatural but rather a real threat to the safety of Sir Henry.<br /><br />Holmes also deduced that both incidents meant that Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville were being followed.  Holmes set out to follow the followers, but was spotted and did not get a chance to pursue the vehicle.  Even in a hectic situation, though, Holmes was able to mark down cab number 2704 in his memory.  He was able to speak to John Clayton, the driver, who said his fare identified himself as `Sherlock Holmes.'<br /><br />Watson continued the investigation at Baskerville Manor, seemingly alone, but one should never underestimate the eyes and ears of Sherlock Holmes, as well as his sense of misdirection.  Watson is able to narrow down the suspects to the small list of four neighbors at Grimpen.<br /><br />Watson also investigates several distractions, such as the escaped prisoner from Princetown who is suspected on the moor, and the other stranger on the moor who Watson suspected may be the bearded man from London that gave him and Holmes the slip.  Later in the case, there was a woman with the initials LL who seems to merit some investigation, but first Watson must determine her identity.  Without very much trouble, he does identify her - and incidentally, she is related to one of the four suspects.<br /><br />The biggest clue for the case turns out to be a painting at Baskerville Hall.  It is amazing that the residents saw that painting every day, but its significance never dawned upon them.  Someone should have given the Baskervilles a copy of [[ASIN:B0083ZR2KU The House of the Seven Gables]] by Nathaniel Hawthorne.<br /><br />'The Hounds of the Baskervilles' was an entertaining novel.  Enthusiasm for the novel had to be heightened because people thought that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had ended the character of Sherlock Holmes forever in 1893.  The book remains popular today.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|As a long-time fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I was pleasantly surprised when the TV show came out. Usually, books to film are dissapointing, but True Blood is very true to the book, but not exact so there's a little mystery.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I have been a fan of NKOTB since 1988.  I love this CD!  All of the songs and catchy and sung well. I wish they played them on the radio so everyone else can hear how good their music is! I listened to this so much that I know all of the words. I love every single song! Buy this!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book was not as good as Dan Brown's other books. I feel his other books were much more suspenseful, and I couldn't tear myself away, while I had to force myself to read this one.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|It plays most everything that the Kindle normally can't play with its built in movie player.<br />I'm really happy with it.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|We (my family) watched Star Trek to freshen the memory. We were prepping to go see Star Trek's new release movie.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Love all of his movies. A lot of action and entertainment. This movie is for me time. Just love it.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I use this with a Mac and it works perfectly. I have a stereo instrument (Chapman N/S) so I can process both signals separately thanks to the dual input. This thing is awesome and suited my needs perfectly.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|A very good movie. Very entertaining. Perfect movie for little girls. Perfect movie for all of those who love Fairies.
0446698326|3.0|Although it is a good book, it is draggy and slow. It is not a book that makes me want to get back to it quickly.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Keeps kids entertained. Good story. I plan on getting the other Toy Story movies. It teaches kids. They watch it over and over.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|People have recommended this series to me and I finally got to watch the first season, thanks to Amazon Prime.  It is well written and the actors do a great job of conveying complex emotions.  The plots are intricate and spell binding.  Great Show
B002ZG999U|5.0|I love Sly and have a lot of his movies. This is adult entertainment. I watch this when I am alone.
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|I liked something borrowed much better. This one seemed to be trying  too hard to wrap it all up neatly. Not bad, just ok.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Very entertaining. Great movie for kids and adults also. Loved the story line. A must see for all. Just loved it.
B003XDZLXW|5.0|FAST Transaction!!! Smooth purchase!!! My daughter absolutely LOVEs them. She couldn't decide which pair she wanted to wear. These are not easy to find in stores for her so THANK YOU!!
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Great viewing for children. Great entertainment. Alwaysys keeps kids happy and quiet.Keeps them smiling all day. Just loved the movie.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Excellent selection of loops.  Easy access and ability to make favorites,  timers,  etc.  Some of the water and fire is a little mechanical/mp3 compression too high,  but very well put together.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|First of all, the 3d effects on this film are phenomenal. By far the best of any movie I've seen. Viewed on a LG 55&#34; 3d LED tv, and it looked phenomenal.<br /><br />The story is equally good, especially if you grew up playing those old school video games like I did.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Been wanting to read this for a while now, and finally did. Couldn't put it down. For all lovers of the fantastic, the magical, the surreal, this is a book you will treasure...
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|If you are a female, young adult, or general lover of Tina Fey and/or SNL: this book is for you!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|If you liked the books and the movies you will love the tv show! Sure the show is a bit gory but the scenery and music and everything is absolutly gorgeous.
B0051OZ564|3.0|The graphics are awesome, but the story line is lacking. Still a good movie, though, and it has leaves some awesome things to think about. I probably wouldn't watch it again, but it was alright.
B0096HL33G|4.0|Good acting but it's not exactly a &#34;feel good&#34; type of story.  Still, I liked it and I recommend it.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I loved the remake of this great series. Although I did not see the original back in the 70's I was able to watch the entire series on Amazon. The remake is true to the feel of the original but brings a new and timely telling of the story. Great acting and wonderful episodes.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|What an engrossing read.  Jack London has that rare talent odd telling a story without  having to use a plethora of dialogue.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging and interactive game that keeps you up late!  Totally bummed there is not another one available and can't wait for a second one to come out.
B00CKQ1092|5.0|Totally fantastic. No really this is Dillinger at their best. Infinity was a long time ago people need to quit comparing every album they make to it. I have every Dillinger album and right now this may be my favorite.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this and played it a week straight in my car CD player !<br />Excellent songs and performances. Loved it!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I've been enjoying this so far. It's deeper than it would seem at first. I'd recommend at least giving it a shot.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|Awesome mouse, shitty software. Lighting is very cool, and customizable. Slightly smaller than the razer deathadder, which is good because it fits my smaller boy hands.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is a few to many drawn out narratives making some unnecessary slow spots in the story. A great read and recommend for sure!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Lawless has everything you want from a Rated R prohibition movie.  You really can't go wrong with a cast of Shia Labeouf, Gary Oldman, and Tom Hardy.  It's a pretty good movie.  I thought some things were a littile iffy, which is why it got 4 out of 5, but overall, it was a good flick and totally worth watching!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I rented. I could not get past the first fifteen minutes of the movie.
030758836X|5.0|The story continued to surprise me, until the end. I love Gillian Flynn and this story was no exception to her greatness. I got to fall in love with Nick through the eyes of Amy's diary. I got to search through Nick's mind to see what was really going on inside his head. Every character stood alone very well. And the dynamics of MO vs NYC were fun.<br /><br />All in all, great book!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I love to see the real things that took place at that time. It help me see just that. Must see!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Good read all on it's own, and great background reading to fill in the series gaps.  I'm only half way through and I regret not buying the last book too.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Wonderful blend of actors to make this a great , bring me back again and again show. When can I get all of season 4?
B008PZYZH6|5.0|Ok so I am a Clive Clussler fan (I wish more of his Dirk Pitt books were movies), and a Matthew McConaughy fan so this is simply a movie I couldn't help but love!!!
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|I still love this season for it's development of the main characters but I was glad when they got back to killing zombies and taking names in the third season. I love the exploration of each person's moral compass and how it relates to this new world that they have found themselves in.
B000063147|5.0|I just bought this CD (again). I like (love) every Avenged album (Waking The Fallen is probably my fave... this is a close second). They all have their pros and cons. Not saying it as if I am a fanboy because I have very varied tastes in music. Nothing like revisiting the original sound of STST. The album has been reviewed enough that I'm not going to get into song-by-song analysis. Nice and lengthy and the kind of \\"screamo\\" I can tolerate (yeah, I'm older than most fans). Some criticize that their influences are way too obvious... So what? They also have an original sound that is all their own. New bands today are being influenced by them. I'm amazed that they were really just kids when they did this.  I've watched and listened to their music mature over the years. I'm looking forward to their upcoming album and the direction their music will go... I'll still keep coming back to Sounding The Seventh Trumpet from time to time though.
B00821OX98|4.0|I personally love Sci-Fi with action and adventure. This has lots of action but lacks the adventure.  Overall, this is a good watch.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My 4 year old grandson enjoys this app. Upgraded from the free app for more characters and different scenarios.  Cute little game.
B006M9NJFG|4.0|This shipped quickly and is a high quality canteen.  After a quick wash and rinse the canteen is ready for use.  I am looking forward to many years of use from this.
1401907725|5.0|This is a great starter set of oracle cards, for someone just learning to use them. Very helpful and accurate. Use them often, along with other sets.
1608955702|5.0|One of the best books I've read on using a flash. I say this because it will save you time in looking around for something to explain the use of a flash with your photography.<br /><br />Besides the basics; it covers HSS, using a flash in broad daylight, and the use of gels. He could have done a better job on the explanation of gels, which can be found in &#34;Digital Wedding Photography&#34; by Steve Sint. I know some other books do cover these topics, but you don't know until you read it. Then it is often too late to find out it didn't come up to your expectation, because you bought the book. He also uses interesting examples, which are easy to understand and grasp.<br /><br />If you want to know how to use a flash, get this book. If you already know, he may show you a few things you don't know, which was my case.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down. What a great..easy read. I can't wait to get to the next in the trilogy. Bring it on!
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss is high level. His content comes from experiences that take place over years and years of intense research. He even teaches you how to increase your vertical jump and how to run faster. He defies traditional knowledge that is outdated and he shows you what works. This is definitely in the top 10 books I've ever read - and I've read a lot.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I like the ability to earn stars as your times lower, but when I got the deluxe I expected more formations that what was offered on the free version.
B00006I53S|2.0|What I have learned over the years is you get what you pay for.<br />This lens is not a sharp lens and if you use it in the studio on a whit background there is allot of ghosting around the image.<br />If you are a professional photographer use the &#34;L&#34; series lens by canon.  These lenses have a red ring around the outside of the lens. L is for luxury.
1616551151|5.0|It's still sitting next to me. I'm enjoying it. A buy.<br /><br />Now let me be less broad. The book is well put together - most of the lore is organized for easier reading. Specifically: the Old Gods, religion, ranks in nobility and even within the Qunari, etc. The timeline running at the bottom definitely gives a better feel of the events happening in Thedas since the beginning (especially for someone who likes the quick review).<br /><br />You can tell they were wary on including details, like Empress Celene and Cassandra Pentaghast. There's enough there to wet your whistle, but not enough to guess what's to come of their fates in DA3. I love/hate the description of the Black City and all vague interpretations of it. If you played DA2, think how much you learned in the Legacy DLC. Yep, that's still it.<br /><br />But for now, the current Volume stands on its own and definitely has filled me in regarding items. There's not a lot about what happened from DA: Asunder, however. I'm curious as to why that is - the Nevarran accord or the White Spire incident. If it's so we read the original book...well, I can understand that. I can't vouch for the other comics. At the same time, however, for a book that came out two years ago I'd figure we would get more information put into World on Thedas. But perhaps I'm nitpicking.<br /><br />Overall, worth it for a person wanting to know more about Dragon Age and before the year of Dragon. I'd probably get this before DA3, however. It will put everything into context.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|If you're into scifi and sweet love stories this is for you.  Love the whole thing till the end, then I just wanted a sequel so I could get it and see what happens next.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Great movie. This is the beginning of four.  I have all of them and hope to watch them in order. The graphics are amazing.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|It's a very bloody and sexual show (extremely graphic) and definitely not for kids. But if you're in need a show that's chalk full of testosterone, this is the one.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|It is great this documentary was made, this man is truly a master I just wish I could eat there some day.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The bible app is great. Easy to use, especially if you need to find specific verses. Has lesson plans if you want to narrow your reading down to specific books or topics. Much better than downloading an entire bible. Much easier to use on and offline.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Poor content - overhyped movie with no real story and messy storyline. Not worth the time nor rental for this movie.
B00899F0G8|5.0|suspenseful entertaining and I could not stop watching it. the girls are very pretty and the gohst,s are lots of fun.
B003U4ZOQ8|4.0|Enjoyed the first 5 seasons.  Great entertainment.  It's getting tedious now.  I watch because my 12 year old is still into it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun but when I get started I want to keep playing. and not put it down. I enjoy this game as it makes you plan ahead.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|An extremely well written story with plenty of plausible science.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and was sorry to have finished it, will be rereading many times!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I never thought I'd find a book that I loved and thought was hilariously funny more than Wallbanger (Alice Clayton). That's until I read Tangled. Reading from the first person, male POV is a new one for me. Guys sure are douchebags...aren't they??? They care about one thing and one thing only! Emma Chase presented this book in a nice HOT little package. Drew is a self-centered, man-whoring pig! I fell in love with him instantly! Watching him fall for someone other than himself was beautiful and the fact that he didn't think it could happen to him? Priceless. There were so many times throughout this book that I was crying from laughing so hard. My daughter looked at me like I had sprouted horns or something.  This is definitely a book I'd read again!<br /><br />So...My words of advice. READ IT!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|God is Love, period. No hell, no devil, just Love. If you are sick and tired of belief systems that essentially say that God is a dick, then this is your book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|its a fun game so you should try it and don't give up on it when you die a lot plz doods download it PLZ doors play it.
0486414124|4.0|My English professor junior year of college recommended this book to me, and I was somewhat skeptical at first. I was asking her a good novel to start on with Jane Austen, and I was surprised when she mentioned 'Northanger Abbey'. I now see why. It was spectacularly written, rarely dull, and delightfully silly at points. I had also just read 'Jane Eyre' which made the part concerning the mansion even funnier. FYI; I'm a guy, so yes it's ok to read fellas.
B0098VXN2Y|4.0|I liked the movie. It was insanely cute. As always Cameron Diaz looks gorgeous so jealous of her body. Good movie to watch to kill time.
159514188X|5.0|I was actually a sophomore in college when I picked this book up for the fun of it. It got me back into reading big time. Everything is here; fully developed characters, plot mechanics, story, delivery, and everything else. I don't think I can gush enough about this book. Easily one of the best novels I have ever read.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Even though I was hoping for a slightly different ending. Jude Law is as awesome as always.  Zeta Jones does a great job in her supporting role.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. I have to admit through some of the games are difficult to win. Them being not supper easy is watch make this game fun. I definitely recommend this game.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I don't know how we'd never heard of this show!  I watched an episode on a whim and we ended up watching every episode on Amazon.  If you liked Boston Public, you'll love Suits.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Umm this app is a gr8 app and I really like the app because I don't have to get on internet
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|One of the best games available in the Amazon app store. Fun merging of runner games and match 3 puzzler games.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I would recommend this to any one, who like wizardry, dragons, deceit. Would not recommend it to be watched with children, there is a lot of soft porn. It's HBO.
B000HZD168|5.0|This is a fun movie and anybody that likes Trek should watch it.  It will tell you the truth about Khan.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|The kindle does not seem secure.  There is also no room for the charge cable to stay connected nor place to store if for transport.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I will qualify my review by saying I am a huge star trek fan, having seen all the series including the cartoon series and movies and owning all of them on DVD.  With that being said, did I like the new Into Darkness movie...well, yes and no.  What I did like, the special effects were great and have continued to get better with the continuation of this new reboot.  The actors in this reboot have also done well at bringing the characters to life without straying from the original intent of the characters.  I especially think that the actors who played Bones, Chekov and Scotty did an excellent job at portraying the original series actors.  The first half of the movie plot I thought was a great way to introduce Khan as the supervillian/terrorist.<br /><br />But here are some of my issues with the movie and the reason why I say Yes and no to liking the movie.  I didn't like in either the first or second movie, the ongoing relationship thing with Spock and Uhura.  Call me a Trek purist or whatever, I just feel there is too much of this in the movie and doesn't really fit into Spock's character.  This half  Vulcan has too much emotion showing through at times. I can give a little on this because we are talking a young half Vulcan mind trying to deal with his emotions..but at times this is way too much.<br /><br />I am still not crazy about the alternate time line thing that still hasn't been dealt with in this movie either.  Unless you totally discount all the Trek lore and history, the time line has to be fixed at some point (hmm maybe in a third movie, we can hope). Also, what the heck has the elder Spock been doing in this timeline??? Just sitting retired? I think not.<br /><br />And finally, where the big let down occurred to me is the second half of the plot.  I had no issue reintroducing Khan in a way that surprises you and adds to the original story, but what let me down is where it strayed into nothing original but a retread of the original Wrath of Khan.  To me, the original Wrath of Khan was probably the best movie and story plot of the original series, Ricardo Monteblan, played an excellent Khan villain with some classic scenes and lines, and I will give the Cumberbatch credit, he played an excellent Khan as well and that is not where I have the issue.  Instead of going somewhere original with this version (like in the first half of the movie), Abrams goes back down the road of telling almost the same story as the original Khan, almost line for line at times, but with one big exception of switching roles between Kirk and Spock.  For those that have watched and enjoyed the Star Trek series and movies over the years, I hope that you understand where I am coming from.  The scenes that were considered classic in the original Khan movie seem less so here.  The classic scene where Spock dies saving the ship and the movie ending with you not knowing at the time Spock was going to come back or not was an emotional tug of war.  I remember at the time sitting in disbelief that they killed Spock.  This version had none of that emotion and had Kirk hopping back up like nothing had happened.<br /><br />I don't mind a retelling of the story, especially when you tell it as well if not better than the original but in this case, I unfortunately don't feel that way.<br /><br />For those that have never seen the original movies or been a fan of the series in the past and are part of the more mainstream audience then you will most likely like this story as well as any other.  I will admit as a fan of science fiction, I enjoyed the movie and is the reason for 4 stars.  But as a fan of the series, I am in an emotional tug of war.  Hmm..., almost like when I watched the original Khan.<br /><br />Alas, maybe Abrams has something up his sleeve for the 3rd movie in the series to make me say Aha, so that was it.  The Trekkie in me sure hopes so.  And maybe that's what Abrams intended.he original Wrath of Khan was probably the best movie and story plot of the original series, Ricardo Monteblan, played an excellent Khan villain with some classic scenes and lines, and I will give the Cumberbatch credit, he played an excellent Khan as well and that is not where I have the issue.

B000FC1CUA|5.0|One of the 100 books on my list that every man should read. Rank this one in top 10. The novel transcends the and allows the reader to reflect onto oneself the meaning of life and the available pitfalls that can accompany the narcissist in us all.
0061122416|5.0|This is my favourite book and I have read it more than 5x. The message it delivers about your true path in life motivated me to leave my desk job and pursue my dream of becoming a physician. I just graduated medical school and am about to start a residency in Internal Medicine. Paulo Coelho is amazing!
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Amazing account f the inner workings of high finance and greed that propelled our country into one of the worst financial crisis in history. M. Lewis has the night and knowledge to allow the reader a clear vision of the complexity and dysfunction that allowed for such events to unfold.
0345803485|4.0|Wouldn't we all like to be whisked away by a gorgeous, rich man with a secret room in his house? While the story is far-fetched, it is still full of fantasy and a wonderful way to escape from the daily ho-hum.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I found this book spoke to me in a way only an overview of ancient text could. The alternative thoughts to what life is about and should be about are refreshing. Inbound the history and content of this writing to be outstanding. Highly recommend.
0307742539|5.0|The third instalment in the series does not disappoint! I found myself at the edge of my seat wondering how the Salandar saga would end. As with the other two books in the series, the excitement is never-ending and the reader is always left guessing as to Lisbeth's next move.
0385333846|5.0|One of the more common high school lit books for obvious reasons. The writing is amazing and any man or woman should read this book once or twice in their lifetime, it is required.
B007Y36K46|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  After all of the wailing and gnashing of teeth when it came out about how bad it was, I put off seeing it.  I'm glad I finally rented it.  Is it campy?  Yes.  No more so, though, than many (many) other space fantasy/sci-fi movies that have made tons of money and gotten better reviews (Jar Jar Binks, anyone?).
B007FH9GA6|5.0|I love this movie and I have watched a lot!!  My only regret is that I did not buy it in HD:(
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game, great pass time when bored. Very additive, almost as fun as candy crush saga. And its free.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I thought I had seen all of the episodes of The Next Generation when they were first broadcast, but there have been a few in this collection I do not remember ever seeing before, and it is great to see them now. I have loved this series since it came out, and by Seson 5 the characters are well-developed, and the actors are totally comfortable with their roles and their interactions. Nice cameos by Spock and Sarek too. A very enjoyable viewing experience.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Fun game.  Kinda like Galaga and a scrolling shooter ala 1942. Some bosses are hard but not impossible.  Fun game to play.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|This has been a fave movie for years. I became aware of the Euro version but was never able to find it till now.<br />If you like this film the extra 24 minutes add a great deal to the store.<br />It is a must have.<br />cmh
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is pretty fun. Our whole family likes to play it. It's a good game to pass the time.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I read another review where it mentioned that the game is close to the actual engineering of the car. So true! I upgraded to 4 wheel drive and bigger tires and what a difference it made! Just like a real car when going up and down hills. This game is addictive. I'm still a beginner, but will go back and keep at it!
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|Not life changing and I hated the Robin character in this one. The batman parts were great but the Robin character felt so hokey, like a B-rated Disney character... and here I thought Disney was only going to destroy Marvel at some point, seems they spiked DC's drink as well.
B0064QNS62|4.0|Like this game, very challenging and fun.  Got this application for free and I have enjoyed playing the game very much
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Well written, keeps you engaged, made me feel like I was there with him, the smells, sounds, heat and freezing cold. I would highly recommend any veteran to read Marcus's account of Operation Redwing.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|This movie was chuck full of great actors and each storyline was interweaved beautifully. However, at times, It was challenging to follow because each actor played multiple characters in multiple lives. This  is like the Matrix in that way...will probably require multiple viewings to fully comprehend and appreciate. Overall, I liked this movie and recommend it to others.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|Shiver is a very interesting book that keeps the reader hooked. When I began reading this book, it took me a while to get into it. I didn't like how it was  written with such an easy level of grammar and writing, but overall I was very pleased.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is the first 3 match game I actually enjoyed playing.  The added element of making the matches at the right time helps make this a fast action thinker.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game I just downloaded it less than five minutes ago and this game is SO fun and easy to play, best of all, its free!!!!!!!!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|pretty fun shooter.  Easy to control.  The only problem I've had is having my fat finger in the way of viewing the action.  It's easily remedied by just moving the ship up some and then repositioning your finger under it.  You still have to be aware of things sneaking up on you though.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|The perfect mix of old west style grit with space travel and scifi. Great mix of characters and actors. Just wish it wasn't cut off in it's prime. I would seriously want to see season 2
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Combining one of the best vocalists in the world with one of the best guitarists in the world and the synergy lifts this work to a very high level. The blues numbers on this collection are not topped in history to this date.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I'm loving it and om non is the cutest thing in the world. I just cant get enough of cut the rope it just makes my world spin around and I always have my kindle with me at all times
B009LMTDL0|3.0|My rating is based on what new stuff I learned that would help me in my career - which wasn't much.  As the primary, and now sole, breadwinner in my two-parent family, I've already lived most of this stuff.  That said, there are great reminders in here about why I do what I do and how to do it better.  What I do think is most valuable are all of the studies which I believe can supply talking points when addressing these issues with people who may believe women have already achieved equality or who don't think women need to achieve equality.  I also think this would be an excellent read for young women - college or younger - who don't have experience in the business world just yet.  I will be giving this to my 16-year-old daughter to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game fun the whole family likes this game. Keep up the good work. More games to come<br />Love it nice game
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is a nice game app. It is not too easy as most tend to be but you can get through it relatively quickly. Don't use the hints and you can make it last a while longer.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One might think that the central question of the drama would be quickly exhaustible.  Is Alicia going to go back to her unfaithful husband or not?  But somehow the writers weave that question into everything else that happens in this series in a fashion that keeps the either/or at bay with never-flagging drama.  We watch it nightly almost, two or three episodes at a time, the closest media experience one can get to a novel.
0770437419|5.0|No, this is not a novel. It doesn't read like one, there is no main character.<br />Max Brooks wrote this inspired by 'The Good War', a set of interviews by Studs Terkel.<br />If you love zombies then read this book, OR listen to the audio book (free from audible).<br />I read the book then, in anticipation for the movie (which is only loosely related) listened to the audio book.<br /><br /> Make up your own mind, but a few bucks is hardly a price to pay for such a well researched, developed, and written book. This book is at times graphic in nature (not for kids), but the realism and factual approach breaths life into this work of fiction. If I didn't know any better I would have thought WWZ actually happened.<br /><br /> Honestly, why worry about negative reviews (you can always resell the book). As a person who loves the zombie genre and a good book the only thing negative I can say about this book is that some stories just aren't long enough, and that the book has to end. (That being said be careful with which version you get. Some are ABRIDGED, you don't want to miss any of the stories.)<br /><br />Don't let negative reviews dissuade you from this great book. To be frank the reviewers who couldn't handle the format or 'voice' of the book just don't have enough imagination. While there isn't really \\"character development\\" you get a sense of global development, the zeitgeist, the spirit of humanity during this crisis. This is NOT a novel. The point is not to make you love or hate characters, but to give an account- an oral history of the war that almost wiped out humanity.<br /><br />  I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. I had to pace myself from reading it all in one sitting.<br />(Make sure you read the FULL version.)
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|The interpretation of the bond between yoga and music is very interesting as well as soothing. This album could be used in a yoga class.
B00BDSRBXM|5.0|I have always loved OMD and this album lives up to what I would expect from a band of this calibre, The DVD is also a great bonus,<br />the guys telling it like it is, Highly recommended for OMD fans.
B00AATV046|5.0|If Cary Grant is in it, then it has to be wonderful.  Yes, this is an old fashioned movie, but it isn't Christmas without sentiment and this cast is wonderful.
B000002JSR|5.0|When you think about it there really isn't a lot to say about Led Zep apart from the fact that they were and always will be the worlds greatest band ( Not just my opinion ) every thing they did was brilliant ( don't worry about the critics they will always find something wrong with anything ) it's their job.<br /><br />I loved every thing they did and this just adds to it.<br />4 Spirits One Mind = Great Music.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|Everything is SO DRAWN OUT . . .  you keep waiting for the characters to get somewhere, but they never do.  It takes them an hour and a half just to eat dinner and trash Bilbo's house.  Then, they travel nowhere for the next hour and a half, get chased by orc's, and wind up on the peak of some mountain . . . which appears to STILL be a 30 mile drive to their ultimate destination, the ancient kingdom of the dwarves.  The eagles should have just taken them to the mountain so we can get the travel channel portion of the movie over with, wake up the dragon (which should take all of 30 minutes) and call it a day.<br /><br />I LOVE the Lord of the Rings, but the critics are right - this should have been ONE Movie instead of THREE - it could have been a spectacular 3 hour adventure.  Instead, it is 2 hours and 49 minutes of my life I will never get back, with more to lose.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Too many calculators are to basic. This one has real depth to what it can do.<br />Already have used it a lot.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|As a fan of many Judd Apatow movies, when  I rented &#34;This is 40&#34; I expected it to be a a fun movie with lots of laughs.  I was surprised when it was somewhat depressing, with few laughs along the way.  One of the few funny things about the movie was Melissa McCarthy, and she was only in it for what amounted to an extended cameo.  The worst part is, that there wasn't really a plot to the movie - basically nothing happens.  Probably the worst movie I've seen in quite some time.  Avoid...
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|For those that continue to wine about JJ version of Star Trek, deal with it. Just cause the movie was not exactly as the TOS was or that some story ideas were incorporated into this one, it has brought Star Trek back to the big screen and introduced new faces to beloved characters and created a new fan base. Yes there will be a 3rd movie and it should be the best one yet, and it just might be enough to bring the adventures back to TV  with what we have enjoyed in the past.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Its a sound track CD, not much more to really say. Listen to it usually during yard work, or in the woodshop.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Fun and entertaining. I'm hoping for more options with the purchased version. Great graphics and callouts.  Easy to wander in circles.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Good game. Controls are excellent. Difficulty is well balanced. Fun! Wish there were more levels to play. When they say 80 levels, they mean 80 waves which is about the same as 3-4 long levels in a traditional top-down shooter.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Really entertaining totally recommend buying it lots of fun. Graphics great. No lag for me anyways. Easy to earn weapons and armour. Probably my favourite game yet.
B008K8U13K|5.0|Sonic Team finally went back to their roots with this side scrolling game.  So many elements and Acts we're familiar with are updated and play beautifully.  Downside is, I can't find a way to use a physical controller as I am not a phone of gaming on touch screen, but despite that. Still loved the game.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|We really enjoy Michael Buble's music, and this CD is a very nice collection.  Some are covers and some are original, I believe.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Finally getting good sleep by listening to one of the binaural beats while falling asleep and all the sounds are extremely relaxing!  Overall really well put together app!!
B00000DHRX|5.0|Very good selection of his music.  Would recommend it to any fan.  This is a multiple CD set of his greatest hits.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My granddaughter is four years old and loves this movie. She is into.princess, mermaids, and fairies movies. I have rented this movie more than five times I am sure of....never gets old for her.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|First saw this on Showtime and kept it on my DVR for months, always afraid I was going to accidentally delete it.
B0012CH350|5.0|Fist my patio char broil great.  needed cover  for patio grill very heavy good for new England wether. Great cover
B009IF8CH6|4.0|The characters are not as obnoxious or showy as before, especially Sheldon and Howard.  Penny has also mellowed out.  She is not the sex symbol as before.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I enjoyed the Black humor of the book.  But in some parts of the book it was very slow moving.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is loads of fun! At first I thought I might be a little put off...eating people 'n all, but so not true! I have actually started looking for folks to munch on, LOL. The graphics are awesome, and the detail in the scenery is amazing. It's a great game for &#34;killing&#34; some time, be careful though, you might just get &#34;hooked&#34;! ;)<br /> Seriously though, give it a try, I think you'll be glad ya did.
0345525558|5.0|Loved this book!  Very ingenious to weave flowers through all aspects of the book.  I would highly recommend this book.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|First off, the picture is the same as the Extreme DVD release from TEN years ago.. Same clarity.. The special features - OVER 8 HOURS (as the Blu Ray Case Describes) aren't there.. When you first insert the disc, unless you have an internet connection (which I do) and an SD card slot and card inserted for downloads (which I do not - not on this device), you get an error message from Skynet stating \\"not enough memory\\".. So, you've already wasted 30 seconds after inserting the disc.. You hit cancel and the Lionsgate intro plays (now a minute has wasted), now since there's no sd card inserted the menu said \\"Not Available\\" all over it. You select the minimal features they do have  - trailers mostly. 2 versions of the film: theatrical and extended..and 2 commentaries, all of which are on the Extreme and Ultimate DVD versions... I forwarded to the chapter where John is being asked by his foster mom to clean up his room (cause I wanted a daylight scene)... Checked it and it's the SAME AS THE ENHANCED DVD... Same quality..<br /><br />My problem here is in three parts: 1) Blu Ray was touted to have all this space to hold hours upon hours of special features, far beyond a single DVD.. From what I remember, they were saying between 3- 5 DVD's worth of content could be stored on a single Blu Ray Disc, however, the special features on a typical Blu Ray are minimal at best, and I've yet to find a Blu Ray where it contains all of the same features as the DVD, let alone, more.. It's always less.. But yet, the studios have no problem issuing these two disc Blu Ray sets, with nothing on them..I know that's just a smoke and mirrors trick to make you think it's a big deal... 2) The picture has been remastered in high definition on DVD, so, really, there's nothing new here... and 3) The fact that I need memory or an internet connection for a friggin' disc to work is INSANE.. I bought the disc, I put it in, it should start up. Blu Ray was supposed to have this fast start technology and feature, however every Blu disc that I have (116 so far) takes it's sweet time, and you can't forward past intros, warnings or menus.. And my Player is a new Sony unit..also, it's kinda creepy that it needs to contact a mainframe in the first five seconds.. otherwise you don't get what's advertised on the package.. Universal Blu Rays have done this too (Casino, the Thing, etc.)..<br /><br />Another note on Blu Ray's operation, the discs are supposed to be more durable than DVD, yet I had a smudge on a new disc and the player froze twice. With DVD, if you turn the power off, it'll remember your place..HA, not with Blu Ray, make a mistake by accidentally hitting the power or \\"home\\", and the whole disc needs to restart like as if you had just hit eject... Then there's the issue of DVD's that weren't produced and formatted for 16x9 screens, 1.85:1 looks criminal by reducing the picture to a widescreen within a 1.33 frame, yet I put in in my up convert Toshiba DVD, and it still fills out at 1.85:1... (T2 is 2.35:1, I know)and if not, I could usually adjust my HDTV's H/V Positions to resize it, this is not available when using the Sony Blu Ray & there's no zoom either... I dunno if this is just the Sony machine that I have, but overall, it's not worth the hassle. And with close to 3,000 DVD's, I'm not rebuying everything, I only intended to upgrade the necessities.<br /><br />So my main point is, if you have an older DVD version of T2, stick with it, trust me, they did a great job on these two particular DVD's; they were testaments to what DVD could do back in the day and were held in high regard.. The Extreme DVD even had a 1080p mastered version of the Theatrical version in that package..and that was 2003.. So for the Skynet Edition I'm only out $5. It was brand new, but I won't be keeping it because of all the unnecessary drama you have to go through before it allows you to select the movie - which I guess is why it was $5, no one else bought it either..... In my humbleopinion, and 116 discs later & into this game, Blu is a BIG Bust..Long live DVD.. Oh, and a similar thing occurred on the Reservoir Dogs 15th Anniversary Edition Blu, but that's elsewhere in another review.
B008133MDK|5.0|Like most Holmes addicts, I had my doubts about the original concept of bringing Holmes into the 21st Century- but boy, was I hooked from the first episode of the first season (A study in Pink). The second season to my mind was even better from Irene Adler in her 'battle dress' to the downfall of our hero. The writers have done it again, every bit of dialogue and character development flows from scene to scene and I am counting the days until the 3rd Season is available for view.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I loved the cast all but for the women who played Mary Todd Lincoln (talk about over acting). The man that played Lincoln was great I have seen him in many movies over the years and he is an ACTOR what ever the role he makes you believe that he is that person. Some facts a little missed but it was a movie and the truth is always overlooked.<br />It took all day to watch as ever scene with the women who played Mrs. Lincoln I just had too turn off and walk away till I could focus again on the film.<br />Thank God I was watching on Netflix would what my money back if I had leaved my house to watch this.<br />Too long, didn't remand true to facts (which I have read about this wonderful man).<br />I could not watch it again.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|I'm writing this review as a public service to people considering buying this.  IT HAS BEEN RE-RELEASED.  Both Samus Aran and Link, in case your interested in that as well, are up for pre-order now both in Japan and the U.S. and will be available in the fall (usually a month or so earlier in Japan ).  There is no need to pay more than $40 to $50 dollars for this. You can probably get it shipped from a Japanese site, SAL, for $40 or less. I hope I can save at least a few people from being reamed on this figure ( and Link ).  As for the review:  It's fun; it has no educational value unless you're interested in articulated toy design and construction; it's moderately durable but intended as a posable representation of a character for teens and adults, not as a toy for children.  Overall I really like it.  Happy hunting.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Couldn't even get past first 15 minutes. It made no sense at all. Had an all-star cast but I'm not sure why they agreed to do this film.
B004H83IM8|5.0|Love the price point for the whole collection of Austin Power movies. Can't go wrong with this little bulk pack.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Am a Star Trek fan and I find this movie entertaining and fun. I recommend it to any Star Trek fan!
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Awesome show. Just when it seemed to repeat ideas a whole new show appeared. Harsher, sexier, and more gritty. Highly recommend.
B008Y79IUE|2.0|Although the acting was good, I thought movie was disturbing and difficult to watch. I would not recommend this movie.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl Strayed is such a good writer that you never doubt for a moment that her totally improbably experience solo hiking 1,100 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail - over glaciers, through snow drifts, without water during 100 degree days and avoiding being attacked by bears, rattlesnakes and creepy hunters - is completely true. The strength of the book is her ability to not only convey the drama of the physical expedition, which consumed more than 100 days of her life, but also her internal journey to find herself after the multiple losses of her mother to cancer and her marriage to divorce.<br /><br />As you hike with her you feel the pain of her tortured feet in the boots that are a size too small, the loneliness of her self-imposed exile on the dangerous trail and also the joy she finds in the daily small miracles of bathing in a cool stream after a 10-hour hike, drinking a cold Snapple lemonade when she briefly stops in a camp or takes the time to take in a breath-taking view of the Sierres. You actually long for her to get to the infrequent camps where she has mailed her supply packages with the meager $20 that she allocated for each leg of the back-breaking hike. And you slowly understand, as she lets you share in past memories what took her on this life-changing challenging walk.<br /><br />It's very unlikely that anyone will follow her onto the Pacific Crescent Trail after reading Wild (and if they do they surely will be better prepared and will certainly make sure that they get good hiking boots) but her lessons of self-discovery are universal - and ultimately quite inspiring. This is a read that stays with you.
B00138KKMQ|5.0|Yes this product stands up to it's name it is filled with Billy Joel's Greatest Hits you will not be disappointed!
B003K07DUC|4.0|Hey- who cares!!! Its a Bourne movie with another title. So they couldn't make another Bourne movie with Matt Damon, so this is for those who couldn't get enough. I have no problems with that- the chemistry is still there. I actually like this movie better than the Jeremy Brenner Bourne film.
B0049VVE7Y|1.0|I love the Walking Dead but I hate this new CLOUD media.  You can't store this on your computer it's out there in cyber space somewhere and you have to have an internet connection to view it.  American's do purchase digital media unless you can store it on any device!  Being able to view it only on any device means that your just renting it!!
B001CDD84Y|3.0|Great vehicle movie for the young man that plays the main character. Interesting concept, but not something that I find gripping.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Yeah this ones really stupid, as I see it George Lucas was sitting on the toilet and looking over his bills mostly his credit cards.  He's strapped for cash cause he's over extended from all that take out Chinese and fried chicken he's been buying!  And he said ok let's send Indie somewhere he's never been and when he flushed the toilet he knew where that place was and so the Indiana Jones franchise went to the same place as George Lucas's last meal!
B0071MV540|2.0|After watching this movie I wanted the time wasted back. Not even a decent heist movie. Sorry- it just wasn't worth it to me.
0545265355|5.0|I spent this Memorial Day weekend reading The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins. By the time I had finished the last book, I realized that I had made an appropriate choice because by the end, everybody, except a few sociopath villains, is struggling with PTSD.  One would think there would be some good treatment for PTSD so far in the future, but there does not seem to be.<br />My daughter-in-law, who loaned me the books, did not like the third book at all, though she loved the first and second books. I think what she missed was the spark of humor in the thinking of Katniss. In the third book, Katniss is so thoroughly broken by all the horror she has gone and continues to go through, that you do not know if she will ever recover. The breaking of Peeta was excruciating to read.<br />I thought the third book was the natural outgrowth of the first two, and followed a progression of events that made perfect sense. The third book breaks your heart over and over again. It shows what civil war is like, and what civil war does. It also shows that taking down an evil government does not guarantee a good government will take its place.<br />The thing I admire most in Katniss is her ability to retain her ability to do what must be done, no matter what. Of course, what must be done is defined by what the end goal is. Katniss never lost sight of the end. What astounded me most about Katniss was her ability to take the tiniest clues and then understand what was going on. Since I am perpetually clueless, the ability to understand from tiny clues looks like a superpower. She exemplified the saying: It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.<br />I had expected the writing to be awful, but Collins is a good writer on many levels.<br />If your books must have a happily ever after ending to justify the time you spent reading it, these books are not for you. If you are willing to have a sorta happy ending with the hero limping for the rest of her life, this book will give you a lot to think about. If you want to know what PTSD feels like, this book will tell you even though the phrase is never used. Warning: a lot of people you really don't want to see die do die.<br />I liked the movie The Hunger Games when I saw it several months ago. It was interesting to see where the movie deviated from the book, simplifying the plot line and reducing some of the gore. I have no idea how the moviemakers are going to handle the third book.<br />I had very few quibbles with the book. I cannot understand how the woods did not get hunted out. Where was New Zealand, Australia, Europe, Russa? They ALL got wiped out? Well, never mind. Bringing them in would have interfered with the morality play.<br />All in all, I'm glad I read the trilogy.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Hey I am a fan of action films, and this was the equivalent of my favorite stars coming out of retirement to entertain me; and it worked. Its a silly film, but very funny with some truly touching moments. We are all getting old, but should never take ourselves too seriously.
B004OUFSMC|2.0|I agree with Michael Wydra's review below: this collection sounds like garbage, for the most part, and for the very reason he says it does: it's over-compressed. Unfortunately, this is true of most modern remasters of old music: they compress it all to heck in an effort to \\"compete,\\" in terms of volume, with modern recordings. This creates a number of problems, not the least of which is the utter inability to listen to it below a certain volume (above which, paradoxically, it becomes ear-splitting) without losing a portion of the music.<br /><br />In addition to being over-compressed, this record has also been subjected to excessive \\"noise reduction.\\" There's an idea in this day and age that analogue tape hiss, which shows up more on compact disc than on record (because the mechanism used to play CDs is itself silent, for one thing, and also because the digital carrier brings out more incidental detail), is somehow embarrassing. (This is also another supposed justification for over-compression: the idea is to \\"saturate\\" the speakers with music so tape hiss won't be detectable.) In my mind, this is simply untrue...and unfortunately, it's not merely an academic subject, as noise reduction also mutes a lot of the wonderful high-end sound that should be such a feature of the Everly Brothers' recordings. Listen (if you can bear it) to \\"Bye Bye Love,\\" one of the great rock-and-roll records of all time: the guitars, which ought to sparkle, sound downright dull, and there's no \\"air\\" whatsoever around the instruments in which they, and the Brothers' harmonies, can expand; therefore the track lacks momentum as well as sheen. Hearing it, as it's presented here, one wonders, \\"What on earth was the big fuss about this?\\" This is a direct result of excessive noise reduction and compression.<br /><br />It's wonderful to have these songs all together on one budget-priced collection...or it would be, if the sound quality was worthy of the delightful music the discs contain. But thisisn't the way the Everly Brothers ought to be experienced, and it's hard to imagine a newcomer to them appreciating their achievement based solely on this collection. Five stars for the music, and none for the sound.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Too many issues with this film to mention here. It tries too hard to be an epic film, yet falls far short of that milestone. There is a good reason editors do not like flashbacks, flash forwards and all those jumpy narrative techniques- handled badly it undermines the narrative. Not to mention the makers should have taken a cue from the last 3 Star Wars movies and stayed away from the made up dialect. in this case it was incomprehensible. Or as Yoda would say, &#34;Understand you I cannot, said I.&#34;
B004UJAOLM|4.0|It is a good book, but sometimes as read it I get confused of which character is which. This book while well written. I enjoyed Jane Eyre more.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I watched it, and thought this was one violent film. I think the Dredd movie from the nineties was better entertainment, because this movie took itself too seriously for my liking. It needed to lighten up.
B005PK553C|5.0|Creepy storylines and excellent acting will keep you coming back for more. Season 2 is just as addictive. Definitely recommended.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|If you're tired of predictable, this movie is for you. Slow at times, this film captures human desire and instinct in the same breath. The outstanding cast delivers a superb performance to bring this story to life. You will not be disappointed.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Very fun app.!!! Have only played a few times but did like it....takes a lil gettng use to- trying to manuever your fighter.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a good game with little challenges spread throughout. Unlike most of my other game downloads, it does not require internet connection to play. Only four stars because it wants you to connect to social media (ie Facebook, Twitter) and I don't have any accounts or want to do this.
B009UZBLSG|4.0|This does just what I expected. When playing YouTube videos to your big screen you should click high def on your phone, which makes it go from very pixelated to looking very good.
B00973902K|5.0|I love this song,the way she sings it is very upbeat and sexy! I will check out more of her music, Im a fan now.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I enjoy reading books about military history, and this one was recommended by my cousin. I am so glad she did. What a touching story of courage and honor! I wish I could have met Charlie and Franz! Although, in a way I feel like I did through the pages of this book. Please get this book. You will be glad you did.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Please heed the warnings of all the one star reviews- this film will leave most viewers wondering why they wasted the time watching this and their money. The film has six different stories in six time periods (1849,1936,1973,2012,2144, and 106 years after the Fall) but the movie is edited so the stories are constantly switching randomly every few minutes. The idea of the characters being reincarnated souls comes solely from the synopsis and is NEVER shown in the film.( unless you count the fact that the actors play roles in each story) This reviewer had to take in the film in two parts as the film was too incoherent to watch in one sitting. The film seems to garner an even amount of five star and one star reviews. The artsy filmgoers seem to find deeper meanings that simply are not there. Please don't tell me that a rotten apple tastes sweet, it doesn't- and this film is rotten. If the stories were separate films then- maybe- the one in the Korea of 2144 could reach for 2.5 stars and that is being generous considering the soylent green allusions. The visual effects in this segment is the only reason this doesn't get zero stars.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|The body count is rising. The plot is thickening. Quality of streaming picture is excellent. Wish they would release new seasons sooner.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book was really good and deep. Your an awesome author and I am about to read the book again!:)
B009NY43NY|1.0|I had to push myself to finish DEA in a timely fashion, since it has 90+ holds at the library. This volume lacked the wit and charm of earlier books. Other reviews have covered the plot and writing style problems well. As to changing the rules of the game, I can't remember how much of Sam could be read and really don't care. I liked Sam in DL, but found him boring and lifeless in DEA.<br /><br />The social and racial insensitivity left me without the words to express my dismay. I'll just have to accept that the Sookie I loved was figuratively staked by her maker.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Miss you, I will love you still, Shine , to name a few-  these songs are special the Album is great,  \\"Miss You\\" hits home after 37 years of Marriage he singing about what I wish I could say.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Enjoyed the series on TV and now can watch any part over and over. Great acting and style to the series. Arrived on time and in great condition.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My Alarm Clock is the best app of any kind I've ever seen. It does wondrous things, it's incredibly easy to use, and, aesthetically, it's a genuine work of art. Some people have complained about having to purchase the 99-cent version. In my opinion, My Alarm Clock is worth closer to $99 than $.99!!
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I both plan to read this to help us discover our personal love languages. I think I know mine, but we'll see!
1476734941|5.0|Received item as described. Package arrived in good time.  Easy to read and follow. I'd recommend it for those who have tried everything to lose weight.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|The first book was great. However, It seems he run out of ideas for the second book. It was work to finish it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free might sound confusing at first, but those of you who don't know it, you could always ask me! It's basically a game that has different kinds of colored dots. The easier packs have bigger dots and the harder ones smaller. The main goal of the game is you relate the same colored dots with each other. Although I haven't explained all of the things yet. There are different kinds of packs-for instance easy packs, hard packs and bonus packs.If you download this app,(Which you should do.)Always remember to have fun playing!
B001F4UHGC|1.0|I know it had a lasting impact on filmmaking, especially the suspense crime genre, but oh my gosh this was so slow and boring. Just watch the car chase on YouTube and be done with it.
B00CATSONE|2.0|It was more of a pamphlet than a book.  Most of the info about Tesla could have been taken directly from Wikipedia.  Beyond that, the author had some kind of a half baked theory about what constitutes genius that he never thoroughly explained, although the life of Tesla actually seems to contradict it.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Very much an enjoyable app. Simulator flying is fun and having dogfight capabilities makes the game most excellent.  Go get some bogeys!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|As per usual, Supernatural never ceases to surprise me. I never know where they're going to go next with the series. It's what keeps me glued to it season after season.
0061124958|5.0|The books came in perfect condition and they were hardbacks which will last longer because I plan to use them each year.
B006X08FDA|5.0|This was the first album I bought after hearing this group this spring.  They are wonderful and  all so talented.
B00AQMQBKK|3.0|I really like the boardgame it is based on, Arkham Horror but there is not much of a game here.  FF games have always been more about story and presentation than complex strategy but this is a little to simple. The presentation is nice but then it doesnt really go anywhere.  I figured the game out easy enough and was able to win on my 3rd or 4th attempt against the easiest guy.  Once you figure out the characters the strategy is obvious enough and then it is all chance.<br /><br />There is little story once the game starts and it is always set in the museum. What is there is great but it is a little thin.  Again, FF is all about story and presentation so a little more during the actual game in text or audio would have been nice. The weapons serve no purpose, a gun has the same value as the cigarette lighter, you just cash it in for another roll. I am a big gun player so this was a bummer.  Also the trophies have little use for most players since most can only turn them in for healing and the game doesnt leave much time for that so it is usually best to avoid monsters. (again, as a big gun player this is another bummer because I am usually the guy running all over the board claiming trophies while the others deal with portals.)<br /><br />The art and presentation is pretty slick.  If you love Arkham Horror (or maybe are a huge Lovecraft fan) and are looking for a quick Arkham Horror fix than it will serve it's purpose.  If you are looking for a good game, this is not much of a game.<br /><br />It could also use some difficulty settings.  Not everyone that plays Arkham Horror is a true-ist that sticks exactly to the rules and loves losing as much as winning.  Most players I know have their favorite \\"house rule\\" so you arent entirely dependent of a good luck streak to win the game.<br /><br />I hope this is just the first of FF's boardgames to be turned into apps because they really are great boardgame makers and it would be nice if their apps of them improved.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great cast, wonderful story.  Got hooked from the very first show.  Hang on to you seat cause it is a bumpy ride with all of the drama, but oh, so very well done.
B002SRQ214|5.0|It is (for me) one of the best AMD Phemon II Xx creations!!!!<br /><br />Best balance, and the only gives you more than what you pay for, it works greatly!!!!
B005H29GSI|4.0|The game is challenging in a good way for developing fine motor skills and it's better for fun group play. My young son prefers this over the electronic version. But this company needs to make a box that's a keeper for storage of the game. They were clueless and/or maximizing profits to the extreme by not making the same kind of sturdy box a board game comes in.
B004UID2LC|2.0|It is hard to navigate through this app. However it is appealing to the eyes and could be fun if you have the time.
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|I like most movies starring Tom Cruise, including all from the Mission Impossible series. It's nice that most of these are currently free with my Amazon Prime membership.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Kid friendly, entertaining and easy for anyone.  It has an arcade feel but with the mobility of a Kindle Fire easy to take with you anywhere.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's a great story line and great characters.  I was happy to see that Amazon prime had the 1st season.  I'd recommend it.  I'd even recommend buying the second season.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|One of the best time management games I have played. The full version is a little expensive, 4.99, but I bought it as soon as I beat the free levels. I highly recommend.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|Very authentic, emotionally accurate, disturbing yet re-affirming.  A rollercoaster of emotion, conflicting feelings, loyalty, and resolution --- following a true path guided by love and respect
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It didn't really take much. I created a thunderstorm and was asleep within 10 minutes! In general, it's fairly simple to get started. But well worth it! Great app!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Wow this book was tough. Being a parent I couldn't imagine being in their situation.. the mother and  the father.  The book was written well, but not enough cliff hangers for me.  The ending was unexpected.  Left some holes. Good but not great.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Fast paced. Difficult to put down. Robie is a flawed but excellent hero. Would have liked more background on the organization Robie worked for.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I think something must have changed since some of these negative reviews were written. I was asked to unlock the bonus chapter but was not charged an additional fee. I found the game quite enjoyable. It's hard to find adventure games where you actually make decisions. So many of them are just a series of ho and puzzles where a &quot;story&quot; is basically just read to you as you go along. To me, those are not really adventure games. This is an adventure game, and comparable to some that cost more.
B007JZGIMS|2.0|The paid unlocker really didn't add much to the free version, but it is always good to reward the developers of the app. I did use the free version quite a bit before opting to purchase the premium unlocker.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Chris Botti put together some of the most gifted musicians around with varied styles and each one seemed to be enjoying  performing as much as I enjoyed hearing it.  I bought this DVD because I  was so impressed that anyone could get such beautiful sensitive sounds out of a trumpet as Botti.  He plays  &#34;Ave Maria&#34; like it was written for the trumpet!  The variety of talent from his guests was amazing. (Who would expect to see Yo Yo Ma and Steven Tyler in the same performance?)  The blending of the voices in the duet of Sting and Josh Groban, the vitality and scatting of Sy Smith, Billy Kilson's drumming together with all his regular musicians made a truly unforgettable show!
B004TI1WME|5.0|Great product. I would encourage everyone looking for a calculator app to look no further than this one! It works perfectly.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|This book accomplishes greatly what it promises, to show you the most efficient ways to fat loss, gain weight and lot of others.<br /><br />I love that it starts with a description of Minimum Effective Dose, as this is the cornerstone of all what's to come: to achieve a maximum with the less effort possible.<br /><br />Totally recommend it!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This album is very well put together. The album sounds like it could have been released back in the old days! I have really missed AIC, and this is some quality work! 5 Stars easily!
B0063M22QO|3.0|again with your word limit requirement... this is why I do not write these things...this game was okay..letters were nice size..ho do you get to the next level...I know deep playing the current level...
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It was my first time playing a G5 game, and I had a lot of fun playing this game.  Some of the puzzles are quite challenging.  Awesome time-killer.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|to much like my bakery story...way to much time...not that much fun...do I really need to write more...I deleted this game after one day
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great show, great writing, acting, directing etc.. The real thing! I wish they didn't have some &#34;sleazy&#34; scenes but that seems to be what audiences want! Sigh!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is phenomenal. It can be a little difficult at times with the touch screen but most Kindle games are like that. I would recommend this game for people sixteen and up at least due to the language (pretty strong in places with the F and S words for people who might be squeamish about those words, but it's a combat game so it can be expected) but other than that, one of the best kindle games I own.
B000069HK2|5.0|I am a huge fan of music and this is my favorite album. Bert McCracken's voice and screaming were at their best here. The whole CD is very raw and energetic, but somehow beautiful. There really isn't a sub-genre to put this album in, it's so unique the only thing to call it is rock. It is really a fantastic album. But if you do not like screaming in any way, look up a song on youtube before you but it.
B0058SNHE0|2.0|too small and too tight. i intend to purches other type.<br /><br />too small and too tight.<br />thank you very much
B004ELSDZK|5.0|The game is easy to learn, and it thankfully teaches you the rules as you go.<br />Very fun to play, it's puzzles are a great challenge!
B006RXQ800|2.0|Unnecessary blood and low lifers, not Historical and no point. Good actors wasted on cheap plot. Save your time & money, go elsewhere!
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|Excellent film, now dated, shows a side of life-now just a memory. I recommend that everyone under 40 check it out to see a snapshot of the time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this book..... it had very good detail! It is usually very hard for me to get into a book and with this one I could hardly put it down, can't wait to read the last one in the trilogy!
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|The first 80% of this movie is pretty depressing, it turns around at the end but doesn't justify sitting through the rest of it. I would pass on this.
B001M1WFAE|5.0|Fascinating Biopic of JPii . . . . It may be a bit mawkish, but is well worth watching and will give you food for thought and might even shake you from any complacency. Dont think it's factual, but will gently nudge you along your spiritual road . . . . .
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Glad the overall SG storyline took a welcome turn with the discovery of Atlantis. Not sure I really like the villians in the new series, but they are bad guys so I guess I'm not supposed to like them. I'm watching the series on Amazon.prime via a 12MB connection, so the HD delivery is nearly flawless so far with only a couple of hiccups. Audio and Video Sync is solid. If you are a fan of SG-1, this next series spin-off is a welcome extension of the story.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I like the option with flipping between mobile and full!  It would be neat to bFacee able to play Facebook games, but free is free and you cant complain there!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Fans of Tom Cruise - watch it. Fans of action watch it... Even fans of cops and the military, and the government getting bamboozled and chasing this &#34;ghost&#34; watch it. Overall it's a fun and enjoyable movie to watch. Don't expect deep character development (it's not a drama), but it's an action film that won't dissapoint. Enjoy!
B006M4F67A|2.0|To hard to see, needs to be able to enlarge, then I would probably like it, but it hurts my eyes now.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|Overall, I like it. It plays like the board game Blockus. Only small drawbacks: No ability to set AI difficulty level. No ability to play with less than 4 players (either via hotseat or AI). Scoring is not relative to Blockus where you get points for what your opponents are not able to play, you only get points for what you are actually playing (which I guess is sort of the same thing, but not). Placement of Orange and Red along same board edge is sort of problematic as the colors are so close and lack proper contrast to make them as distinguishable as they need to be. Overall, I'm still playing from time to time and for the freebie cost, my complaints are also free of charge.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|My daughter loves it & she has a very good time with cooking. She feels like she has her own diner.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Hours shall pass before you know what you are doing and then you are just lost to explain your self and just what you think you are doing playing a game for hours.  Good luck with the boss.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|As other reviewers have stated, I do find the controls a bit difficult; but, after awhile, I found that once you get used to how to \\"control\\" the car, the game does get a lot more fun. Meaning, I found out that at times it's better to tap forward/reverse rather than press down on them to give you better control on the car.<br /><br />The levels for me are challenging and very fun for me. I actually have tried beating some levels many, many times that I don't even notice twenty-thirty minutes have passed by. So, as long as you enjoy this game, it is a fun time passer.<br /><br />The controls are simple: you use the left side to slide the wheel left or right to turn the car left or right. The three buttons on the right control forward, reverse, and brakes. The car WILL continue forward/reverse if you stop pressing/tapping either button (so I recommend pressing the brake whenever you want to completely stop). You also have three \\"lives\\", so if you bump into anything three times, the level will reset itself.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this show. The childhood anticipation is eat at to see who will show up next while the unique storylines tie them all together satisfies the adult viewer in me.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I really have nothing bad to say about this app. It's a great game and fun to play as well, though it wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for a good game for young children and (even after looking at the game pictures) thought that this would be a game they could play. However, I don't think it's a game that would keep their interest enough to play it. And, as I'm not trying to play games like this one at the moment, I probably won't be playing this game much at all.<br /><br />However, the graphics are adorable; I love the opening dialogue; I love clicking on the fish; and I love the whole \\"Nemo\\" aspect to this game. It just wasn't a game that I thought I was getting. I would still recommend this to people who love playing games like \\"Farmville\\" or \\"Happy Aquarium\\".
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This was just a great movie.  Every now and then you come across a movie that just touches your heart and this is one of those.  The acting was simply outstanding.  And the story was perfect.  I am a big fan of Michael Oar.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|Such a cute game! Pretty much, really, all you're doing is moving around penguins (with your previous ice block sinking into the ocean). Your goal is to get as many \\"jumps\\" as you can. I like the graphics of the game and the sounds are OK. You have the choice between four penguins that you can change to either have the space empty, CPU, or another player. You can set the level difficulty as well; and the boards are changeable, too, with you being able to get more when certain things are met (like winning so many games in a row).<br /><br />The kids I babysit love playing this game; and though it's a bit difficult for the three year old to play, he gets the gist of it and loves it! I also enjoy playing the game with them or by myself.<br /><br />Since I got this app for free, I still would recommend it, but if you're not sure you'll enjoy it (and don't have young children), then you \\"might\\" want to save your #3.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am not a big soap opera fan but downton abby grabs you in and won't let go. My wife calls me a chic but I must admit I really love the show.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book has a powerful heroine your heart goes out to, plot twists that thrill, and fast paced plot with action, adventure, and a deeply satisfying ending--though not exactly what you expected. A great story told with top notch skill.
B000QCS8RY|5.0|I never tire of reading this book, it is a short and sweet love story.  Always picks me up when I am down.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Just what I expected from Tina Fey - there were parts I laughed out loud.  She is such a funny lady and this book proves it!!
B008N1V11U|5.0|was a good game and even thlugh a normal dark knight game wasnt around this was a great one awesome
B00881VLCE|4.0|It a pretty good game with the typical advantages of playing the puzzle digitally. You get a lot for free, and the in app purchases are reasonable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is the best game that they have ever made and I think everyone should download this game BEST GAMMMMMME EVVVVVVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I'm proud of his girl who not only overcame a horrible situation but then sat down and wrote about it. Amazing!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun. I recommend to anyone looking for a game to play to kill time.
055358202X|4.0|This fourth installment is just as full of plot twists as its predecessors. There's so much you expect and yet is seems to surprise you every time.
B0070YDOT8|2.0|U need to b rich playing j p<br /> do not exist buying coins do exist when sale on u lose more
B007VTUYWW|2.0|If you make a movie based on a video game, of course this is what you get.  There were a lot of fun action sequences here, which makes it two stars instead of one.  But, unless you are a 13-year-old boy, you probably can find a better way to spend your time than watching this movie.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Hopkins and Mirren are perfectly matched in this biopic of director Alfred Hitchcock who dominated the 1950s and 60s.  At a number of spots I perceived references to Hitchcock films that I was probably missing.  But that makes me want to watch them again.
B00866JL96|5.0|we all can be lucky so we wish can come true, for all of us  less is more stop words
B0026772N8|5.0|...but definitely not a motorcycle book. It took me a while to get through it because I find philosophical concepts laborious at times. However in the end I sincerely enjoyed this thought-provoking story.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Everything you'd expect, and pretty much nothing surprising. Cute but flatter than flat. The acting team makes it fun, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|There is not such thing as the story of something. All you have is versions of it. If you read Steve Job's biography you have one of them. I Wozniak is another one. I had fun reading this one. Wozniak version of the story of Apple is playful and also very sweet.  It's about his life and the meaning he gave to it. Not only through Apple but through his own path to discover what was really important to him.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm not a real fast paced game player, so having to move the kindle all over took some getting used to....
B006ID01OS|5.0|First strategy book I've read in a while that made me really think deeply of where I want to drive my business. The focus on &#34;purpose&#34; will help entrepreneurs truly determine why they're in business. Sooooo many strategy books say the same things over and over but not this book. I highly recomend it and will read it again soon!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This app/game is fun and is great for killing time. It is good that they added some new birds and weapons.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|My first Iron Man movie. I would say Just an OK movie.  The story and villain started out good, but fizzled out towards the end.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Tons of sounds and easy to navigate. Great for people with little children too. Much better than those apps with few sounds and lots of ads.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book helps me to appreciate my innate abilities and quirks as an introvert. And I have to admit learning that others feel the overwhelming need to leave a great party with friends because it's just too much stimulation was a big relief.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this series is wonderful with many twists and turns. very tastefully done time piece.  brings up issues that transcend time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great book from start for finish.. although the ending was quite surprising I would recommend this book to anyone with a family who has had tough decisions to make
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I was not sure when I began to watch this but Mads Mikklesen is fantastic and this version of Red Dragon is very involved with the persons who are working with or for the FBI. Hannibal is more sinister than ever!
B00846REIS|5.0|JUST FINISHED READING BARED TO YOU. GIDEON CROSS IS THE KIND MAN YOU JUST WANT TO BE NASTYYYYY  WITH.<br />Ohhhhhh the SWAG in this man.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Didnt know what the movile was about and I like that about some film. They surprise you at they go along and this one didnt dissapoint me.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Could not put this book down it was a great read and I'm going to look for more books by this author
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|It was a little long for me but still earned the four stars for Tom Hanks and Halle Berry performances.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Excellent read, another great episode in this saga. Can't hardly wait for the next book.<br /><br />Hopefully I'll live long enough to read the final chapters, which are due over the next few years.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was a great story that stayed with me for a long time after watched it. Good acting also so.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|One of best Series. The imaginative prospects still hold for all these years. It one day will not be science fiction but fact.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game ! But when I go to visit friends it takes forever to load. So I have to shut my Kindle fire down. Other than that the game is fun.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|One of best Series. The imaginative prospects still hold for all these years. It one day will not be science fiction but fact.
B0001I562I|5.0|This is a fun movie for kids of all ages, I loved it when I was a kid and now mine love it as well!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. It  is good for any age and very challenging.And I hope you will like it to
B000050FEN|4.0|brad pitt does a believeable performance in this movie,  kevin spacey also does a very good job,  gross at times, but lets admit it folks, doesent a bit of gore just add something to any movie?
B009K86D86|4.0|Much of this was very enlightening and disturbing at the same time. I imagine that was the intention of this documentary. As most of us are consumers, we really need to take note at what we are being subjected to. I would recommend everyone to watch this. In the end, money, power and greed seem to be the theme. I was disappointed to learn how many government agencies are being headed by former employees of these huge corporations. Now making sense how particular laws and regulations have been passed to favor the very same corporations.... Ugh!
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Anyone who like JH or SRV must have this in their collection.<br /><br />Jimmy Dewar's voice is out of this world.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Great!! I used it to teach archetypes to my sophomores. It's an intriguing story for both genders! A must-watch for almost any age group!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|My kids ages 6-12 really love it.  My 15-year-old says there's not much content, so he doesn't care to play it.
B004WO57E4|5.0|My husband and I both loved the original and it is so hard to find anymore.  This includes the original version of HM&M.  We have been able to enjoy playing it while the rest of the family has enjoyed playing the later versions.  As far as game play, this is a turn-based game which I also enjoy as I do not have the hand-eye coordination for the more active games, nor does my arthritis allow me to play as quickly as required.  For those who are not familiar with turn-base, each player takes their turn and the other players must wait until you complete their turn before they can do whatever it is they are going to do.  There is a lot of fun in these games and I would recommend to teens and adults alike.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Period dramas rely on creating the time and space of the era they seek to portray.  Downton does this on all levels!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|No one is able to make tragedy seem beautiful as well as Vonnegut does.  The introduction of time travel makes his format of story telling seem more cohesive than most of his other books.
B004Q7DQLS|3.0|Decent story that lacks finesse. The author used about five obscure words that I had to look up and that the character's wouldn't use and yet, all the other prose was so basically delivered. I made myself finish the book just to see how it all played out. I prefer the dragon stories of G.A. Aiken.
B00BB22GSU|5.0|This album is much more mature than the previous two efforts.  If you like them, you should like this too though.  Best album from a production standpoint, though it doesn't feel overproduced.
0061969656|5.0|Bernard Cornwell tells a great tale, and I have really enjoyed this series. I'm looking forward to the next book in this series!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was the first Marvel movie I saw that I actually liked ( the only other phase 1 movie I saw was Iron Man, which I didn't like).  Before this I'd been disappointed by every Marvel movie I saw (which was everything except for the good ones related to this; & I still haven't seen the Incredible Hulk).  But this was by far the best comic book movie ever (The Dark Knight is overrated)!  It was excellent all the way through.  I kept expecting something really stupid to happen & ruin it but no such luck.  Everybody was prefectly portrayed in thi film, except for Iron Man who was funny but still a bit too much of a jerk for me to like, but that's the only disappointment here.  Highly recommended.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Listened all the way through over and over again. I LOVE this CD and highly recommend it to anyone looking for melody, a little edge and great vocals!
B004A8ZWW4|3.0|Despite a tired old story (told before & probaby better in Rocky & Karate Kid), this is worth seeing just for the fantastic robot fights.  Any robot fan will not wnat to miss this.  And it's much better than any of the new Transformers movies.
B002LANLDK|1.0|I'M UPSET, I WAS CHARGED FOR THE SAME MOVIE TWICE ON THE SAME DAY AND TIME.<br />I DON'T KNOW WHO DO I NEED TO CONTACT TO GET MY REFUND.<br />IT'S $3.24, BUT STILL IT'S MINE NOT YOURS.
B000127LW2|5.0|I've always loved Star Trek.  When I was really little, my favorite \\"adult\\" show was The Next Generation.  Even though I could barely grasp it, there was always something appealing about it.  My favorite episode of the Reading Rainbow was the one with the behind the scenes look at TNG.  Later, we started renting episode of the Original Series from our local libraries, & I loved those too.  They don't hold up as well as The Next Generation does.  While there are some really good episodes, one thing drags it down:  William Shatner.  Everything else is good, but Kirk's acting is so annoying.  I also watched some of Deep Space 9 on TV, which I loved, as well as Voyager.  For a few weeks I went over to my aunt's house next door & we'd watch Voyager together.  It was my least favorite at the time, but now I'd definitely rank it above TOS.  I got this after an acquaintance of mine recommended it to me.  He said that this was his favorite Star Trek after TNG, because while it was never as good as TNG, it had no bad episodes (I've seen 4 bad episodes in TNG season 1 already, & I'm sure I'll see more before I'm through).  I've halfway through season 2, & I'm inclined to agree with him.<br /><br />1-2.  Caretaker:  On a mission to the Badlands, the USS Voyager, along with a Maquis ship, is stranded in the Delta Quadrant, more than 70,000 light-years from home by an incredibly powerful being known as \\"Caretaker.\\"  The best pilot I've ever seen for a Star Trek show.  A<br /><br />3.  Parallax:  Voyager is trapped in a quantum singularity's event horizon, and Captain Janeway must decide between Lt. Carey and former Maquis B'Elanna Torres to be the new chief engineer.  B<br /><br />4.  Time and Again  Captain Kathryn Janeway and Tom Paris are sent back in time one day before an alien planet is annihilated. They attempt to stop the explosion that destroys the planet.  B+<br /><br />5.  Phage:  An organ-harvesting species known as the Vidiians steal Neelix's lungs, leaving him to die.  A<br /><br />6.  The Cloud: The crew enters a nebula to collect samples before realizing it is a living organism.  A-<br /><br />7.  Eye of the Needle:  A micro-wormhole is discovered that leads to the Alpha Quadrant, and the crew make contact with a Romulan ship on the other side.  B+<br /><br />8.  Ex Post Facto:  Tom Paris is convicted of murder on an alien world, and his punishment is reliving the murder from the victim's perspective every 14 hours.  An excellent noir episode, directed by LeVar Burton, proving that any Star Trek actor can direct better than Shatner.  A+<br /><br />9.  Emanations:  Harry Kim is transported to an alien world at the same time a dead body arrives on Voyager.  A<br /><br />10.  Prime Factors:  A race that could shorten Voyager's journey with a transportation device will not share its technology.  B<br /><br />11.  State of Flux:  Janeway and the other senior officers attempt to flush out a spy who is sending information to the Kazon.  A<br /><br />12.  Heroes & Demons:  The holographic doctor must rescue crew members who were turned to energy in the Holodeck, by entering a holodeck program of Beowulf.  I hate holodeck episodes but this was redeemed by a spotlight on my favorite character, the Doctor.  B<br /><br />13.  Cathexis:  An alien mind takes over crew-members' bodies, and Chakotay is left apparently brain-dead after something attacks his shuttlecraft.  A typical plot but good enough & had a good twist.  B<br /><br />14.  Faces:  B'Elanna Torres is split into her human and Klingon halves by the Vidiians.  An excellent episode, featuring one of the most gruesome deaths of a red shirt.  A+<br /><br />15.  Jetrel:  A member of the Haakonians, a race warring with the Talaxians arrives on Voyager, much to the dismay of Neelix, whose family was killed by them.  My favorite episode of the season, apart from maybe Faces.  A+<br /><br />16.  Learning Curve:  Tuvok trains several Maquis members who have not fully integrated into theVoyager crew.  B<br /><br />A good set.  The most annoying thing about the show is that failure is the only option when it comes to getting back home.  Apart from that, it's worthy of the Star Trek name.  I look forward to seeing the rest of the series, especially the ones with Q.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|The book is really well done, as most anything by Neil Gaiman is, and well worth your time to read. If you're not familiar with the gods of many cultures, you're about to be!
B004LWZW42|5.0|Movie spoilers ahead!  Don't read this unless you've seen the previous movies.  As you know, I love the X-Men, but the movies weren't very good.  The first one was okay, nothing to love about it except for Wolverine.  X2 was a mixed bag, it had some really good moments as well as some stupid moments, but it would have been good it it weren't for the contrived ending that killed off Jean Grey.  However, the 3rd movie would've been the best if they had just stuck to the original idea & not killed off Cyclops, Jean Grey (again, for good this time) AND Professor X!  And don't get me started on Wolverine Origins; the only good part was Ryan Reynolds, who was hilarious as Deadpool.  But this movie tops them all.  It was really good, despite being different from what I expected in an X-Men movie.  I just wish they'd forget the other movies ever happened & just reboot it from this one.  Maybe then we'll get an X-Men movie with Rogue done right, or Gambit in more than a came, or any other of the really cool characters done right.  All I can say is Days of Futures Past looks promising.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|At first it was annoying but once you get the controls you are not going to be bored. This game also is cool because it is s good valence of temple run and a video game.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|When I first heard about this movie I thought it would be stupid, but I found it surprisingly watchable.  It wasn't perfect; there were a couple moments that slowed the action down or were just plain annoying, but I am glad I watched it & will watch it again someday.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is a price of history that is new. It is a good story for . All ages and is not to hard or simple<br /><br />Most one star reviews were by accident or the people wrote about a different version or they got it paperback and who cares about the paper quality paper is just a mushed up tree that is then flattened and has ink stuck on it. Read 5 star then 3 star reviews and if you want to read nonsense do 1 star
B0034G4P80|5.0|Naturally I had to see the films that built up to Avengers, so I started with this one.  Not only did it tell a good, strong story it had some great comedy as well.  Here's hoping the sequel will be just as good.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is a sweet game but my person won't move side to side so I die on certain parts (friend's had same prob) wish there were also a few more dangers and jumps
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I checked this movie out on a whim because I love sci-fi stuff & it sounded interesting, & boy it was!  The first half was really intriguing, & the final battle was one of the most exciting climaxes I've seen in a film.  It's a shame that there won't be a sequel.  I read the book it was based on, & thought that the movie was better.  Oh well, at least the book series continued so we can find out what happened to everyone, & the sequels are much better than the first one.  I guess we'll never know if the movies could've improved upon them too.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's very hard to put this game down! Even my children love it we play to see who has the biggest shark
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America wasn't my favorite Avenger, but he was my second favorite.  And this movie is second only to Avengers.  All the actors were perfectly cast, & the atmosphere was just excellent  There was only one stupid scene, but fortunately one click of the skip button will make it vanish (I'm sure you all can guess which one it is).  Folks, this is a must-see.
B008VBYN80|4.0|A fun game will keep you occupied and using your brains to shape your city citymore involed than the sims
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Like the A-Team, my dad borrowed it from a friend, then liked it so much he showed it to the whole family, & we liked it.  Personally, I didn't like it as much as A-Team, but it's still an above-average movie.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Mindful story that keeps you tuned in but also keeps you thinking, lots of action..! Very enjoyable dialogue with interesting new actors and good direction..
B002ZG994U|5.0|I never saw the show, but I heard about how silly it was.  My dad borrowed it from a friend, & so I tried it with him.  We loved it.  It was sort of like Mission Impossible, only funnier.  I loved all the characters, but my favorite was Murdoch.  Later I bought it or a dollar.  One of the best dollars I've ever spent.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Mindful story that keeps you tuned in but also keeps you thinking, lots of action..! Very enjoyable dialogue with interesting new actors and good direction.. I hope Stallone does ten more of these...!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I started to watch this series because I like Debra Messing, who was outstanding in the short lived series, \\"The Starter Wife\\" and  of course, as Grace on the long lived sitcom \\"Will & Grace\\".  What a bonus to find that Katherine McPhee is, if not THE  star, a major role player in this well written, engaging show about a show.  McPhee has an incredible voice, and if you were rooting for Katherine on American Idol, you are really going to appreciate her acting talent as well.  This show has an excellent ensemble cast and though I usually don't watch musicals, I enjoyed this first season very much and can't wait for the second season to become available under the Prime Instant Video program.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Adequate story that keeps you tuned in but also keeps you thinking, lots of action..! Very enjoyable dialogue with great old action actors and good direction, by Sy.. If you like seeing these guys together as much as I do you will love this movie too...!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show.  I cannot get enough.  So much drama and great story lines.  I'm hooked and will keep watching as long as it's around.  I'm a fan.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Mindful story that keeps you tuned in but also keeps you thinking, lots of action..! Very enjoyable dialogue with interesting new actors and good direction..
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Good puzzle and the building of your character is a fun diversion too.  I highly recommend this app to anyone that enjoys adventure/puzzle games.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Mindful story that keeps you tuned in but also keeps you thinking, lots of action, enjoyable dialogue with interesting new actors and good direction..
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It took long enough, but finally Amazon gave our Fire's something other than an icon with a link to the mobile FB webpage.  It's the same functionality as the android apps available, which is leaps and bounds better than the mobile web version.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love the modern Sherlock who doesn't lose his identity in the United States.  I also enjoy how it starts at the beginning, when Holmes and Watson meet.  We learn about them as they learn about each other.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I loved this book and can not wait until the next one in the Clifton Chronicles comes out.  I think everyone should read this series.  Jeffery Archer is a very good author and I would tell every one to read his books.
B0081336FO|5.0|The mysteries continue.  And the cast and writing are not a disappointment.  Just very, very well done.  I thought as a Sherlock fan, I would be disappointed in this modern version, but am not.
B00338QENI|5.0|This author's reporting on the life and family of Henrietta Lack was interesting, educational and horrifying all at once. Students of medicine, science, and any kind of social work should read this book. It is amazing that Rebecca Skloot was able to persevere in order to get this difficult story told.
B00C9QQBA6|5.0|This is one of the best scyfi stories I've ever read!  Neat blend of fiction with actual historical facts.  The only problem is now I'm hooked on the series and can't put them down.  Don't buy the first one unless you want to be hooked....
B007URVZJ6|1.0|Not sure why it's even offered - of no real use whatsoever. A competent book would definitely be of use to authors.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|It was shipped quickly, properly,  and with no damage.  Great shape and as promised.  Love listening to this on my long commute to work.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a book that everyone should read to understand the Afghan people better.  I know it's fiction but most fiction has a solid base in reality.  The idea of selling a child to be able to provide for your family is almost unbelievable.  But I can see there is no other option for some people.  Pari's father loved her deeply and it hurt him a great deal to do this.  A father's love is no different from those who are enslaved in poverty to a father who is wealthy.<br /><br />Sometimes it's difficult to know where this story is going but when it comes together in the end, it just made me grateful to be a part of these people's lives.

B007PVHMCG|2.0|Bought for grandson who loves Mindcraft and Legos. We received the product and was very shocked at its size. Looked on Legos web site to see if there were other sizes and found the product direct from Legos was MUCH cheaper. Felt like Amazon and there provider was a real ripoff. How can a discount internet sales company like Amazon charge much more then direct from the manufacturer. It is like car dealers that sell their cars for more than the MSRP, because they can.
B00CFOXBX2|4.0|If you liked contagion you'll like this movie with the same vibe.  Jude Law is very good and I usually don't like him.  Interesting twist I really didn't expect.  See it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an amazing book about an amazing boy!!!!!!!!  PLEASE NOTE: ONCE PAST CHAPTER 1&2 YOU WILL BE AMAZED<br />This book makes you have a new look on situations in life.  I hope people have the same reaction.

B0029LCJJS|5.0|Exciting and daring intro into the life and history of England during the rein of king HenryVIII.  He and his court were aptly represented and richly decorated as well.  Any history buff would love it too.

B001DM1VXE|1.0|This is one of the most boring movies ever.  And unlike &#34;Plant Nine From Outer Space&#34; or &#34;Terror From Tiny Town&#34; it isn't even campy or entertaining in any way.
1451695195|5.0|A moving testimony to what awaits.i think this book should be read by everyone who might be afraid to die. Don't be.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really well written and addictive, i would recommend this book to anyone. It's definitely worth 4.99, and probably much more
0765325950|5.0|I simply love this series, and I wanted a signed first edition for my collection.  I'm always a little skeptical when purchasing an autographed book sight-unseen, because I've actually had one seller call the printed signature on the cover page a 'signed copy'; however, this book arrived in excellent condition (well packaged) with an authentic autograph.  Thanks!
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|It took a few chapters to become comfortable with the anachronic order of the chapters, but once that comfort level was found each jump into the past illuminated why the Gentlemen Bastards were no ordinary den of thieves.<br /><br />Granted, it does abruptly and pointedly take you out of the action, but by the end of the book my groans turned into true excitement about what would be revealed, knowing I would be thrown back into the fire once the Interlude was over.<br /><br />Don't get discouraged if the early going leaves you disoriented because the last quarter of the book more than makes up for the changing gears in the early going. This is definitely a book worth losing sleep over. By the end you'll get a clear picture of just what it means to be 'thick as thieves.'
B000IONJJ2|5.0|Kevin Kline is so funny in this movie.... I saw this originally in the cinema when it came out... still love it.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Anyone who doubts there are still concentration camps in the world, needs to read this.  It is disturbing to think that the free world allows such conditions to exist.  Hunger is so powerful it will turn humans into robots of apathy.

B001C08RHA|4.0|Even before this film, it appears that Iron Man was a staple in many lives through the comic strip;  by now it appears to be a thriving industry, what with actor and animated movie sequels and I don't know how many other manifestations. Whatever the rest of the Empire can deliver in terms of entertainment (I have seen none of it), this movie was worth watching and can be recommended for pretty much all the family (old enough to know it's only actors who are being killed and they will get up to play again). Downey and Bridges are admirable in their roles and Gwyneth Paltrow does as well as necessity to be a subdued character allows. I don't know that you want to pay much attention to the \\"moral\\" issues which are inserted to differentiate the Good Guy from the Bad Guy; they are there so that the tradition of the Comic Book (and much else in the popular media)-The Fight Between Our Guy (Good) and the Other Guy (Evil) can be manifest. Audiences love, and perhaps need, that. I do too.

B0001US62I|5.0|Angel Heart is my favorite movie of all time. The director Alan Parker has created a timeless masterpiece utilising two great talents of our time Mickey Rourke as Harold Angel and Robert De Niro as Louis Cyphre ... Lucifer.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT - At that time, 1987,  most people did not figure out the obvious (Louis Cyphre is Lucifer) as Mickey Rourke mispronounces the surname Cyphre's throughout the movie. I have noticed that the Amazon summary spoils the \\"secret\\" that Louis Cyphre is Lucifer. These days people divulge fact that De Niro is Lucifer  immediately  spoiling the secret.<br /><br />Angel Heart and The Mission<br />De Niro was filming Angel Heart whilst also filming the epic movie - The Mission. Rumor has it that De Niro flew back to the US on weekends or quiet times on The Mission to complete Angel Heart. De Niro plays the bearded Mendoza in The Mission, and has a beard up until the second last scene in Angel Heart.<br /><br />The story is simple yet brilliant. A man sells his soul for limited fame in World War II New York. We subsequently discover through Harold Angel's investigation that Johnny Liebling, cum Johnny Favorite who was called \\"golden tonsils\\" just prior to WWII with limited fame as a crooner. Like all alleged Faustian pacts with the Prince of Darkness it was short lived and a debt subsequently owed. Johnny Favorite thought that he had a legal occult loophole found in a n old ancient manuscript where there were incantations in Latin and Greek , and tried to avoid the horrific debt.<br /><br />The Devil<br />De Niro's lines are brilliant with my favorite being: \\"Alas, how terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the wise.\\"  An excellent line that was borrowed from Oedipus Rex.\\"  The last juicy tit bit is De Miro's last appearance in Angel Heart. A few moments prior to the movie's ending, De Niro appears beardless Blink and you'll miss it - he is crouching outside Johnny Favorites' hotel room dressed all in black as a nun. Many re-watch Angel Heart again for this scene alone, as they ALL missed it in the repeated viewings. To this day, De Niro playing Louis Cyphre is the best on screen devil or Lucifer.<br />(NOTE: Another memorable actor playing Lucifer was then then relatively little known Viggo Morgenstein as Lucifer in the 1996 movie, The Prophecy)<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES -  As the story unfolds we are taken on a wild dark ride with the dark occult growing. In the SPECIAL FEATURES the director, Alan Parker, claims that the story moves south to Louisiana to highlight this fact that we are moving to the hot swamps of the Deep South which is to reprsent a step closer to hell. I missed the obvious and that is what I love about Angel Heart. Every time I watch Angel Heart I discover something new.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke<br />One of Mickey Rourke's finest efforts. He guides us the audience through the unravelling of the story with the scene with De Niro in a Louisiana church being the crux of the film. Rourke is swearing in church with Louis Cyphre constantly reminding him of his surroundings to which Angel(Rourke) replies that he doesn't care as churches give him the creeps. Angel he that the is coming across too much religion. De Niro then says \\" they say there is just enough religion to make men hate each other, BUT, not enough to love one another.\\"<br /><br />There are rumors that Angel Heart may be re-made in 2013, I don't know why. We saw Total Recall re0made in 2012 and it was a useless effort as it no doubt, will be with Angel Heart. You cannot improve on perfection.<br /><br />This is why Angel Heart is my favorite film as it is a simple story, brilliantly executed.<br /><br />  Five out of five !!!!eight Lousiana detective standing over a naked Lisa Bonet with a gun in an inappropriate part of her anatomy covered in blood asks an almost irrelevant question  \\"Why did you come back Angel? \\"  Even though Rourke says this is my home, we the audience know it is so that Johnny Favourite/ Harold Angel is damned for every sin.<br /><br />Another magnificent line from the film  by Louis Cyphre is \\"no matter how carefully we sneek up on a mirror what stares back at us is always the same.\\" That is not only a line from Angel Heart but spiritually, can almost be considered one of the Noble Truths within Buddhism. Our reflection IS always the same as is that of the outstanding Angel Heart.<br /><br />This is why Angel Heart is my favorite film as it is a simple story, brilliantly executed.<br /><br />  Five out of five !!!!
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Politics may be more about power than public service - however, we were riveted from the start! A must see - Ian Richardson is brilliant.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Wilke Collins spins a fantastic tale of intrigue,madness, and tragedy amidst a powerful love story. Told the through eyes of various characters the narrative tells the tale of Laura and Marian half sisters who share a close bond, and of Walter Hartwright their drawing master who, all three, become victims in a complicated plot with disastrous consequences.
B0000SVW8G|5.0|Leave your judgy mcjudge pants in the closet for this movie.  This is just another  &#34;The holes in my head matched the horns on his&#34; story.  It's not a plot/romance with straight, clear lines.  What I love about the two characters is that they are both damaged, desperate people who find peace with each other.  For some of us who like to color outside the lines, it's damn sexy and poignant.

B004GTKP3S|5.0|I was looking for something to put me in that perfect historical mood, something reminiscent of Austen and Bronte and this fit the bill.  Both the first episodes and this beautiful offering made me cry, laugh, and long for the happy ending it finally gave me.<br />Judi Dench is brilliant, but the rest of the cast is fantastic without exception.  When the credits rolled at the final scene all I could think is I wanted more.

1250012570|5.0|OMG!!! If there was 10 stars to give I would be giving it 10+ stars! This book is the most beautiful love story I have ever read. It felt so real! More real than your typical love story with a happy ending kind of story.<br /><br />This story had everything a young couple go through in high school and at home. I love that the main characters were different race. I really fell in love with Park even from the beginning when he is not the most likable. Every little thing Eleanor & Park go through in this story is magnificently told. I could just picture watching them at my high school and me being there watching them go through it.<br /><br />I want to say more but I can't and I won't because I want everyone to read this book because it will leave you sad/happy. Sad because you don't want the story to end. but more happy than anything. Happy because you lived threw this wonderful and heartwarming love story between two incredible, unique individuals.<br /><br />Thanks so much to Rainbow Rowell. I will forever treasure this book!

B006LSZECO|1.0|Not well written with a ridiculous story plot.  At first, I was very intrigued and then the story really got ridiculous and unbelievable.  The ending was just really stupid.
0345803507|5.0|great ending to a awesome series....there could be one more book though, i would not mind reading another. Def have to read them in order though.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is fun but scary at the same time when you stop to think how easy it would be for the human race to die from one quick moving virus or bacteria created in a lab. Watch as your creation takes over and starts killing off mankind and see if they can race to create a cure before they are all dead. Sounds rather morbid, but the game is both fun and an educating eye opener of \\"what if.\\" Well worth the 99 cents.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is so fun and cool, I enjoy the fun fantasy concept of the game. It also seems to make the time fly by. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the movie and characters.

B000SEHJGQ|4.0|Henry \\"Hank\\" Chinaski, the protagonist of Ham on Rye, is the alter ego of the author Charles Bukowski. Both were born in Germany and grew up in depression era Los Angeles. Both suffered learning difficulties (Bukowski was dyslexic) and were outcasts, prohibited and disinterested in playing with other kids. Both suffered at the hands of an abusive and philandering father, who had always been quick with the strop. Both too suffered the pain and public revulsion of the ugliness of acne vulgaris, enduring excruciating treatments with the same stoic detachment as he came to endure his father's beatings (usually in the bathroom). \\"I didn't hate him. He was just unbelievable, I just wanted to get away from him. I couldn't cry. I was too sick to cry, too confused. The strop landed once again... I heard him walk out of the bathroom. He closed the bathroom door. The walls were beautiful, the bathtub was beautiful, the wash basin and shower curtain were beautiful, even the toilet was beautiful. My father was gone.\\" (HC)<br /><br />Theses life experiences would surely have come off as whiny and depressing in the hands of most authors. But the economy in Charles Bukowski's style resists that, even disdains it. A style described of simple sentences, short bursts of clarity, of emotion and action darkly comic, without extended prose forcing the reader into a tedious reduction to extract the important points. There is no waxing on as escapism. There is no whining, just a scowl and shrug of acceptance. Actually there is sometimes joy, a joy in the appreciation of simpler things forced from the bleak backdrop of his life; a homerun hit in a pickup baseball game (he was always chosen last as a kid, if at all) or the warmth of that first draw of whiskey, the latter being a life-long obsession.<br /><br />Hank Chinaski, like Charles Bukowski, reviled middle class social values, the belief that there was any inherent fairness in the system. \\"All a guy needed was a chance. Somebody was always controlling who got a chance and who didn't.\\" (HC) \\"I am still here, leaning toward this machine.\\" (CB) Hank, like Bukowski, found no answers in religion, or faith in general. \\"Her smell was mixed with the smell of the church, which smelled like piss. Every Sunday people came to church and smelled that piss-smell and nobody said anything. I was going to tell the priest, but I couldn't.\\" (HC) \\"Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.\\" (CB) Bukowski did live to the fullest, and Death surely trembled when it took him in 1994.<br /><br />Charles Bukowski isn't for everyone. Those of rigid and certain values will shout against him. But I shout for him, Hooray for Charles Bukowski! I miss you.ways controlling who got a chance and who didn't.\\" (HC) \\"I am still here, leaning toward this machine.\\" (CB) Hank, like Bukowski, found no answers in religion, or faith in general. \\"Her smell was mixed with the smell of the church, which smelled like piss.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble appeals to my entire family- even to my 26 and 20 year-old.  This CD has a good mix of songs- he reminds me of the Andy Williams of listening to the greats like Andy Williams and Frank with my parents.
B005LAII80|5.0|Resembling the ultra-violent action classics of the 1980's, this is an assured re-launching of Judge Dredd on film. The cinematography is shocking and beautiful, in turns, and the Slo-Mo sequences are unforgettable in their immediacy and visual impact. Karl Urban is a fantastic Dredd, and as befits the character, never takes off the mask. Lena Headey is soft-spoken and off-putting in a wonderful way, and Olivia Thirlby makes the most of her several opportunities to shine. This is a visionary work made (comparatively) cheaply, and something for both adaptations and action movies in general to ascribe to.<br /><br />The 3D version is included on the disc, which is nice to have.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As others have said this is a great game with intricate puzzles and stunning graphic detail. The one down side is how short it is, but for $1.99, I still highly recommend it.<br /><br />I look forward to more in this genre from Fireproof Games.
B00C1S945G|4.0|Doctor Crusher takes a short hiatus from the series, replaced by a Doctor Pulaski who actually was in a couple of episodes of the original series. This season introduces viewers to the Borg and Guinan, key figures in the overall series. It also saw some more development of Data's character, always fun. Overall it's a good season, but there's even more to enjoy down the road.

B002JM1VJG|5.0|I received my collection of Madonna videos and was thrilled. I couldn't wait to pop the discs in so I could go back down memory lane. I can understand why people said Warner Brothers did not put a lot of effort in making the picture quality better but you know what? They look exactly the way they did in the MTV days and if they were good enough for us then, then I don't see the big deal. People today just look for perfection at a cheap price and here, we get what we paid for. Video's of Madonna from the 80's. They were great then and they still are great today. A fun filled collection of some of the best music to dance to. Enjoy! I did
B00A77II0U|1.0|I was really looking forward to playing this game. Tried it on my 8.9 Kindle Fire HD with 32 GB storage. I have had a lot of fun playing other HOG with no problems. However, this game has frozen on me several times. I have cleared caches and memories and did a reboot. Evrrytime I tried a fix, it seemed like it was going to work. The most irritating part is that the jast time it froze on me was right after I ddclinrd an in-app request to rate the game, and I hsd only been playing it for about five minutes.<br /><br />Beyond that, I was disappointed with clunky graphics and a very thin premise--much like a funky role playing game from 1994. If this is what the game is like, I can live without it. As noted in other reviews, it would be unlikely that anyone would ever finish the game without using some of the hints along the way. I think this is partially true because the graphics were so bad that items were difficult to spot--again like the old, funky 1994 New Orleans detective role playing games and totally unacceptable on an HD large screen.<br /><br />I had spent previous hours totally enjoying the much better designed HOG, THE ROOM, with excellent graphics and a premise that was much more compelling. I have learned my lesson and I know which game designers to trust and which ones are so interested in garnering reviews after only a few moments play that ittotally takes you out of the already bare-boned premise.<br /><br />I feel certain that brtween the designers and Amazon, I could get help in resolving whatever problems this app has caused. Fortunately, I did get to play enough of the game to see that it did not rely on the cleverness ofthe player and was, in fact, more like sitting through a bad movie with bad graphics and a ho-hum script that left nothing to look forward to othrr than finally being able to say I msde it all the way through this mess.<br /><br />From now on, I will stick to clever, compelling (and less expensive) games like THE ROOM and developers that can deliver them without the nagging to give a review when I have been in the game for only a few minutes.<br /><br />I take no joy in posting such a negative review,perhaps THE ROOM has spoiled me into expecting excellence without begging and providing a game worthy of the label HD. I am very slow in pecking out a review from the Kindle Fire keyboard, hence the occasional typos are contained above. I just looked foreard to finally having the time to put into this game and waited until I could give it the attention it deserved. I only wish that I had known how very little time this game does deserve.<br /><br />IF ANYONE OUTTHERE IS LISTENING, I SURE WOULD LIKE MY 299 COINS BACK AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE THIS TRAVESTY OFF MY DEVICE (which has never had a problem with the most complex of apps) AND OUT OF MY CLOUD. I will never trust developers who are si interested incheesy attempts to get good reviews based upon only a minutes of play again. Do you mistrust your own work enough you cannot waitto solicite a revrew until tbe end of a PAID GAME, rather than taking the player out of the premise for an early review before problems night develop.<br /><br />I am too gripy. I had just expected a fine game and found instead a buggy regurgitation of a worn out role playing game maquerading as a HD HO game.<br /><br />UPDATE: Finally figured out that even though the game kept telling me to hurry and that I was running out of time, I was searching for hidden items too fast. Remembered reading in the tutorial that the red haze meant it was getting ready to freeze, with no mention that it could not be fixed and go on from that point. I was actually looking for things faster, as the game has so many hints that I t6hought the red haze was one. My bad! To really check the game out after discovering this, I spent 13 hours playing the entire thing, including the bonus chapter. I have to tell you, it is just not my kind of game. I can't blame the developers for making games for which there is a demand. I had just been spoiled by THE ROOM and expected much better graphics and much more thinking needed to finish the game than going from one spot full of hidden objects to another one over and over throughout the game. Worst of all, the items that were difficult to find, were difficult because they were in dark areas. I know some people like this kind of game, but I would rather solve real puzzles and be challenged mentally than spending too many hours just clicking on every dark spot and hoping I would get lucky. Still would rate it only one star for people like me that prefer games like THE ROOM, but I do understand how people totalloy into HOG might like this. However, with the poor graphics and mindlessness of the play, I don't see why this is fun. Might as well be guessing on a game of battleship for no more than an intellect was challenged in this game. I will say, however, for all those that do like HOG games of this sort without challenging puzzles, that the developers did give their customers a lot of the game for the money. It was just about 13 hours too much for me--a day wasted. Feel free to like it; I am happy to agree to disagree!r which there is a demand.

I will say, however, for all those that do like HOG games of this sort without challenging puzzles, that the developers did give their customers a lot of the game for the money. It was just about 13 hours too much for me--a day wasted. Feel free to like it; I am happy to agree to disagree!
B00932A4XE|3.0|I guess my expectations were too high. Thought it would be funnier but not many laughs. Was an OK movie for Mothers Day.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|The game is easy enough for my four year old to enjoy, and yet has harder play options to make it more of a challenge for me.  The graphics are a nice throwback to the old space shooters as well.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Fantastic imaginative story, with wonderful descriptions and vivid detail. It leaves you with the question and a dilemma<br />As to what really happened and how strong Pi was to survive for so long agains all odds.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Besides loving the series it is so cool to be able to watch the episodes back to back without commercial interruption.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|These days its hard to find TV shows that entertain you without agitating your mind. Lark Rise to Candleford is a rare exception. Each episode has an interesting storyline, good dialogue, and wry humor. The content is sweet, but not too sweet. it calms my psyche and keeps me interested. For me, it ranks up there with Downton Abbey for quality TV.
B004Q3UL2O|2.0|This was just a weird movie.  I never understand what makes some of the female characters so alluring, yeah, their pretty, but why?  I thought this was an unhealthy relationship, messed up, didn't enjoy movie.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I loved watching this years ago and was happy to watch it again-very well done-----great story line-----romantic and loved the actors
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This was really hard to put down.<br />i dont normally read these types of books, but the characters were really interesting
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have this app in my iPod and I was looking everywhere for it and then I looked up racing games and then there it was! The thing that is my favorite about this app is I bought every car and I don't recommend that you get the tank because it goes really slow but other that that the app is great and I highly recommend Minecraft players to play this  I don't know why but all of my friends play minecraft and they love this app so PLEASE get this app
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I had to restart because of freezing issues and lag issues but other then that the story line was expected but fun. the scenery was creepy but not too creepy.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This a pretty fun game.... I just wish there were still games where you could play as many times as you want without having to wait for more lives
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I loved this show..saw it with my family and we all enjoyed it. My son loves the books and I also read the book to compare it with the movie..the movie was very close to the book, Give the movie a try..its worth the watch.Loved the graphics and the creatures.
B00847KFDS|5.0|For Fogerty fans, the next best thing to a new Fogerty album with new Fogertunes -- is a new Fogerty album with old Fogertunes!<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers here that I was skeptical about this duets album.  After all, I thought old John had taken a victory NAP on the rather unnecessary \\"Blue Ridge Rangers Ride Again\\" album a while back, lending only vocals and some background guitar.<br /><br />Fortunately, here he seems again fully engaged, as a songwriter, singer, guitarist, arranger, and producer.<br /><br />In short, Fogerty fans will want this album because the Foge and friends breathe new life into some of his best songs.  And fans of good music will want this album because -- well, you're not going to find so many classic songs so well played and sung on any other album this year, unless Bob Seger comes up with another \\"Face the Promise.\\"<br /><br />There's some wondrous stuff here.  The Foo Fighters knock \\"Fortunate Son\\" out of the park, and Miranda Lambert and Tom Morello take \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\" places that lovely ballad has never been.  Brad Paisley and the Foge trade scorching gee-tar licks on \\"Hot Rod Heart,\\" and Alan Toussaint brings his Dixieland magic to \\"Proud Mary.\\"  As for Jennifer Hudson's singing on that timeless song -- lord, but that girl has a set of pipes, and she pulls out all the stops here!<br /><br />I was also thrilled to hear the new rendition of \\"Someday Never Comes\\" by John and a group I had never heard of called Dawes.  This song is a lost classic if ever there was one, from CCR's disastrous \\"Mardi Gras\\" album -- and I don't know if John has sung it for forty years.  I always thought maybe it was too painful for him to sing, given the heartbreaking theme of fathers and sons failing to live up to their promises.<br /><br />At any rate, the song still has the same immense power today -- one of the most hauntingly beautiful ballads this side of Rodgers and Hammerstein.<br /><br />Finally, the two new Fogertunes here, \\"Mystic Highway\\" and \\"Train of Fools,\\" show that our old hero still has a closeup and personal relationship with God when it comes to the art of songwriting.  \\"Highway\\" soars aloft in particular and features a nifty arrangement with a melodious melody, lyrical lyrics, and a glorious gospel break.<br /><br />I should also mention how good the whole album sounds -- this is a state-of-the-art recording, something not possible in CCR's heyday.  You also get an interesting booklet in which John comments on each of these famous compositions.  He pulls no punches when he talks about Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War, and good for him!<br /><br />The amazing thing, as the Rolling Stone review noted, is that John has tons of material for a worthy follow-up album, perhaps even a double. Off the top of my head, I think of songs like \\"Down on the Corner,\\" \\"Green River,\\" \\"Up Around the Bend,\\" \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door,\\" \\"Hey Tonight,\\" \\"Rockin' All Over the World,\\" \\"Centerfield,\\" \\"Rock and Roll Girls,\\" \\"Flyin' Away,\\" \\"Don't You Wish It Was True,\\" \\"Joy of My Life,\\" \\"A Hundred and Ten in the Shade,\\" \\"Deja Vu,\\" \\"I Will Walk with You,\\" \\"Sugar-Sugar,\\" \\"I Can't Help Myself\\"...  the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Last but not least, at just $10 for a full hour of prime Fogertunes sung and played to a fare-thee-well, the purchase of this album is simply a no-brainer and one of today's best entertainment bargains.  And you certainly don't need 3D glasses to enjoy all this multi-generational goodness!

B00B2V66VS|1.0|This is a nice game until it crahsed on my kindle fire. I have the first generation Kindle Fire BTW. It is very dissapointed for so many fans who actually love this game and still waiting in helpless situation. I am very suprised to find out there are so many people complaint about it and Amazon still hasn't done anything to fix this problem. A good company, a very good device and a very polular game can not work together and come up with a solution after such a long time dispite so many complaints from customers. What can I say?
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Writing is engaging and humorous. Interesting culture to learn about. I am an avid competition runner. I definitely would recommend this book for easing reading material.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Nothing but ads... collects info AND SHARES it with 3rd parties. (You agree to) I couldn't get it to work for all the ads.
1579128955|5.0|This is an eye-catching, fun approach to the traditional periodic table.  My students from elementary through middle school are fascinated with the visual take on chemistry and how they can make connections to real-world items they use or see everyday.
B009NY43NY|3.0|First of all, I would like to say that I am a huge Sookie Stackhouse fan.  I have loved the books since I began reading them a few years ago.<br /><br />Now, the review of Dead Ever After:<br />I may be a fan, but I can also be disappointed.  The last few books that have come out since the release of the True Blood series have seemed rushed and under-developed.  The read is too fast, loose ends seem to be tied up rapidly.  Conversation in the book at many places is staggered.  Unfortunately, it just did not feel like Sookie.  The one thing that I can say I am glad about is that the series is over, except for the recap book coming out later.  I pre-ordered that book as well, as I am looking forward to reading about the characters.<br />I liked the book, but I did not love the book.  I don't  know if there was a rush for completion.... but it felt that way.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I knew that this book was the last of the series going into it, despite knowing that there are lots of twists and turns in the book.  Never lets you down, just wonderfully exciting.
B008133MDK|5.0|This show is miles above Elementary, which is still better than most of what is on tv.  I am eager for Season 3.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's truly a great book. If you are skeptical about the context of the book it's more then just what you hear. There is a storyline to the series and it isimpossible to put down. Give it a try!
B00499QUK2|5.0|The acting is great.  I like that the episodes are related to Doyle's stories.  The catch to that is I wished there were more episodes.
B00991TCOG|3.0|The music is interesting, but after I listened to this CD, I fell that I have heard all this young lady as to play. It sounded like one continues sound with little difference between tracks.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watch the Firefly series and Serenity movie every 12-18 months.  I enjoy them that much.  If you haven't seen the series, watch it first so you can fully appreciate the movie.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game gives you a lot of styles to pick from. If you get stuck, you can shuffle the tiles and go on until all the tiles are used. rather than just having the game end.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorites from childhood...magical yesterday, today and always. I highly recommend it for musical lovers of all ages.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Now you can see all the items you are buying or selling. It even tells you when someone is watching the item and when it is paid for. Great app.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Brilliant game completed in just over a day, very addictive :)<br />Will definitely play again. Onto my next mission......<br />look forward to a sequal??
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was fun to read. It was mindless reading (which I enjoy). It is very similar to 50 Shades of Grey but nonetheless, I still loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|They have it on google play they need to get it onto Amazon Android Appstore Since they both are linked stores and kindle fire runs android 4.2 Jelly bean Amazon Skinned
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love it because it is a good game my friends like it to it cool it the moon rlly  cool but I think u should not be a lot of money
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a completly spell binding book.  I love it and am going to find more books by William Landay.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|When the book came out a few years ago everyone said, &#34;You need to read this. It's great.&#34; Well, I didn't read it. Now when the movie came out everyone said, &#34;You need to see this.&#34; This time I decided to watch the movie though I've put it off. I was very pleasantly surprised. The story line was actually quite interesting but even better was the cinematic wonders created by Ang Lee with the animals and the days at sea. The actor who portrayed Pi was very good. But the tiger and the other animals are what really caught my attention. They are just so realistic and soulful. It is a wonderful story that should be viewed by young and old.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I loved this book about teen agers. i would read it again.<br />I like to read books about people of all ages just so I know what is going on.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I've read all three books in this saga and enjoyed them all very much. Archer is a writer who weaves a great story that keeps you interested with characters you want to learn about. Definitely a good read!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Wow!!!! LOVED this book. I can't remember when I have laughed so much while reading a book.  Drew such a character he is. This so would make a GREAT movie!!!! Please do yourself a favor and start reading it immediately. You will NOT be disappointed.
B0016OM3TU|5.0|Any movie that allows you to watch Dexter Gordon, and the other assorted Jazz Greats that are in this movie is a 10.
1400069289|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent read for the variety of examples, and the way the author looked at habits.  The book covered retailers, history, psychology examples as well as sports teams.  I would highly recommend this read for anyone interested in learning more about how we can help employees, or better understand others as it relates to changing or creating a new habit.
0765325950|4.0|Well, it's finally wrapped up!<br /><br />I expected more twists and turns at the end - it was pretty much what you would expect to happen at this point.  But it has happened - maybe that's what I like best.
B000NY12LO|4.0|As usual, I think I won't like it because it goes so slow to start, but then it speeds up and pretty soon I'm so engrossed I can't put it down.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|It's not complicated and not exciting, but why can't I put it down.  If I have a couple hours to pass, this will do it.  I enjoy it.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I love Daniel Craig. I think he may be one of the best Bonds ever. He combines the steeliness of Sean Connery with the humaness of Pierce Brosnan and ends up making the character that much more enjoyable. Of course the theme song is great. Other than that, it's a typical Bond movie with all the interesting technology, fights, etc., although the ending is a real shocker (won't give it away).
B0018BB20W|5.0|Timeless. Tracks one thru seven are great. The remaining tracks were thrown in as filler in my opinion. Still, a wonderful disc.....still reliving the 60's.
B008I43DYU|5.0|easier to use on my kindle instead of finding a calculator or using my phone to do it.  would recommend it
0060245867|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter has this memorized since we read it so much.  We like the other books in the series but this is her favorite!
B000000OQY|3.0|Bought this CD on a whim at Best Buy today. Haven't heard a lot of these songs in years - it was worth the 5 bucks. Music is much more reasonably priced these days. Not quite as good as the GNR release with all the famous songs on it, but still good.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Two killers! Two killers the same night. That would be our luck! Yep, that the central theme of the unlikely event of this book. However, nice prose of humor and angst.
B004KPHQR6|3.0|...of those actors that seems to have disappeared after an interesting and strong start to a career... this sstory is a bit of a far-fetched Sci-Fi adventure... not bad really, just not a total engrosser either...
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and allows you to play by yourself, with a friend, or with the computer on various levels.
B007LE2VDM|5.0|There are some strong empowering songs as well as a few emotional ones. It's a great album to listen to the whole way through.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|good time killer ... kinda boring if you lack great skills(like me)... but nice nevertheless ...<br />good for long waiting. hrs...<br />btw... don't. spend those diamonds to fast... you will need them pretty soon
B0089LOG02|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  I love historical fiction, but this seemed like a strange premise. As I started reading, however, I realized that this was a part of history that I had not heard of before-the Orphan Trains.  I knew nothing about thousands of orphaned or destitute children from New York were shipped to the Midwest to be taken in and hopefully adopted by families.  This book seamlessly weaves together the story of Vivian and Molly. Molly is a 17 year old foster child who has been bounced around the system for years.  She is almost aged out, and is looking at a very uncertain future.  When a small misstep almost lands her in juvie, she accepts a community service sentence to help clean out 91 year old Vivian's attic.  While working together, she learns Vivian's story.  As a young girl, Vivian immigrated to the U.S. from Ireland in the late 1920′s.  When a fire claims the lives of her entire family, the Children's Aid Society steps in and places Vivian along with other orphans onto trains bound for the Midwest.  There, they will hopefully find families that want to adopt them.  Unfortunately, more often than not, these families were looking for free labor.  The story alternated between Molly in the present day, and back flashes of Vivian's experiences.<br /><br />I really loved learning about the orphan trains and seeing history unfold through Niamh/Dorothy/Vivian's eyes. I also learned quite a bit about the Penobscot Indians.  I thought this was a very well written, engaging story and would strongly recommend reading it.  I am so glad She Reads picked such a great selection for the May Book Club.  Please stop over there and see what others thought of this book.<br /><br />I posted this and other reviews at my blog- http://turnthepagereviews.com
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was an excellent and thought provoking game.  However,it was too short. I enjoyed immensely.  Wish there had been more levels.
B009CCBCU4|2.0|Good story, but frequent errors in proofreading...  Skipped words, poor grammar (yes, I know it's supposed to convey another culture, but there were still mistakes). Every time I came across one, it broke the &#34;spell&#34; of the story line.  The 3 main characters were fleshed out well, and the two fathers and the chief, but other than that, pretty thin. I'm glad it was free.
B004H1EAJA|5.0|One of my all time favorite albums of all time. Haven't stopped listening to it since I re-purchased it on Friday.
B00932A4XE|5.0|This movie most definetly surprised me!! I didn't think that it was going to be that good and would probably be &#34;stupid&#34; but it more than surpassed my &#34;expectations&#34; Lol! If you get a chance and are looking for something to watch - please , please watch this movie! It's the best!!
B001I13PM0|5.0|I play this one over and over to relax me at night. Yanni's music helps me sleep and when I wake up I start it again.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|This game looks like fun. BUT, IT WILL NOT DOWNLOAD. I have tried a bunch of times. Contacted Amazon &amp; the person has the appt. Still no luck. Tried rebooting &amp; everything.  Guess won't be playing this game. That really makes me upset. It was free &amp; guess won't be buying the full appt. :-(
B00CW665VI|5.0|A book we've all been waiting for....the guy's POV. Yep, you heard me. everything we wanted to know they were thinking and how their minds work. I came out laughing hysterically and loving every minute of this. Think of it as Wallbanger (Alice Clayton) with a twist on the other side of the country.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love this game, so much fun, addicting &amp; time killing if you have nothing to do. Wish you can add more levels.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I absolutely can't wait for the next one to come out... I was gripping my seat and screaming the whole time!
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|We uploaded to our TV from Amazon.  The sound quality was terrible!  I don't have problems with netflix so know it's not at our end.  We've had this happen with other Amazon movie downloads too.<br /><br />I would say the movie was good but couldn't hardly hear anything even on Max volume!
B000002IJL|5.0|Loved the movie and had to have the sound track . plays well and trouble free . sound is clear and crisp .
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|fast delivery on this set.  I was trying to stretch the episodes out since season four doesn't start until 1/14 but I watched them all in a week!
B004ELSDZK|5.0|The game makes you think to solve the puzzle so it is NOT a game of luck...it IS a game of SKILL.  I find the game is a lot of fun to play because it stimulates my interest and keeps my attention.  Unfortunately, the game is VERY ADDICTIVE and I find myself routinely pulled to try the next level.  Great game, it keeps my attention, it is fun to play, but it is addictive.  Beware...
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Wonderful. . Every actor in this beautifully designed film was amazing. The story was rich and didn't have holes..very enjoyable.  I loved. So I bought it.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Keeps your mind sharp and helps your reactiveness. (is that a word?)  Anyway it was fun. need four more words..here they are.
B0081KTHEQ|5.0|A wonderful creepy victorian gothic ghost movie with an actul plot !!! Beautifully made sets amazing u feel like your in this one. I love it.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|I downloaded this game a couple days ago when it was the free download of the day. At the time of download all the restaurants were open and free for play! After an update, now I only get the first set restaurants free and asked to pay 6.99 for the rest! Love the game but if it was free download it should remain free!
B008220C38|5.0|I've followed Keira's work since she started. She is one great actress. The whole film is beautifully done and is one to see again and again.
B0097A2LTW|4.0|I just got this and I never seen Flight of the Navigator before.<br /><br />I thought it was good for the time it was made. A little cheesy, fun, and funny<br /><br />Come join the Alain Adventure and pick this up and see what it like to fly in a UFO as a child haha
0316017930|1.0|The book is so on the wrong track... I can think of counter examples per argument. What he refers to as \\"accumulative advantage\\" may explain how some ordinary people exceed other ordinary people. When it comes to \\"the outliers\\", however, which the book intends to explain, accumulative advantage, patronage, or parentage are not enough. Out of ten kids with similarly proven intellect and same environment, one grows up to be an outlier - the book needs to explain it. There are many January and February birthday kids in Korea who excel in school even though the school year cut off date is march 1. And about the town in Italy, only because a, b, c weren't the reason for a phenomenon, it doesn't automatically make d (referring to community effect by author) the cause - without testing. You've got to find another sample with d and show the same phenomenon. Plus, there still is a chance for other causes (e, f, g, etc.).
B004TI1WME|5.0|I loved  this calculator app  simply because its visual - in that you can see your numbers as you enter them. in addition, it does differentiate  positive an d  negative with use of colors.  Very easy to use!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|To hardddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd need help and poor graphics than screen shots and very broad and annoying sometimes and sometime it makes me mad
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is one of the most honest heart warming books I've read since The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I loved it.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|I thought this was a great movie cause I always wanted to see what happened at the beginning how the x-men were formed. I give it four stars cause of some little issues like Scott summers younger brother being in the movie but it works so whateva. Overall great movie awesome story plenty of action at a great price
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Must buy if you love Joe.<br />I love the variety of musical sound, buy this for something you don't hear very often.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Big Fish has great acting, splendid directing and incredible cinematography. It tells a heart-felt tale of a passing father and his son's attempts to understand him on a more meaningful level. Very few films have left me feeling so emotional. I would rank this in the top 10 films of the past 20 years.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|this book has so many twists & turns, good for a YA book.. just started the series & I am excited to read some more. you must have an imagination to read these books for sure there is so much detail that goes along with it, well done excited for the movie
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I have read all of the Harry Bosch and Lincoln Lawyer series and I must say this book was both a waste of time and money.  Very poorly written with dialogue bordering on an absurd.  It was as if the author was looking for reasons to use the F bomb and failed miserably even at that.  This will be my last Michael Connelly book and I would advise against anyone buying it.  Go to the library and be disappointed for free.<br /><br />Joe Akin
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I couldn't wait for DVD or Netflixs. It was so convenient to just buy the whole season.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love the look of the game.it is very fun to play with the dragons in the park.it is challenging with breeding.<br />it is very cute and fun.let just put it at that
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is written from the hero's pov. It's completely different from anything else I've read. I love how he's telling you a story with lots of extra narration.<br />I did not like that he continued to sleep with other women. I am a die-hard romantic though and I like it when the hero doesn't even LOOK at another woman after he's met the heroin. He never cheats on her after they get together and the reason he's with ow is the heroin is engaged and \\"he's a guy\\". I love how he shows his emotions. And he knows how to grovel.<br />Can't wait for more!!!!!!!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|A nice continuation of the original game. Blitz style play makes for a fun change, and the ability to allocate tokens adds a strategic element to the game.
1451695195|5.0|This is an amazing book for anybody.  It proves the power of Christ and the promise of the future in so many ways.  Parts of this book made me cry with joy!
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Thia is the first Bonamassa album purchase, but I will definitely be buying more in the future. Great jams, great voice, great acoustics!
B003TTMFCK|5.0|This has been and is still my favorite season. This season had the best story line and character relationships.  You really get to know the characters.
B003CP72QK|4.0|This movie was way violent. I guess I never know what to expect exactly, and I get the message of the movie, but damn.  Vi-o-lent.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Though the book is a little different than Enders Game it is another great book by Orson Scott Card. This was a fun and interesting story.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|I have tapped numerous times on the dropbox icon and nothing happens.  Product does not load.  It seems useless for me and will keep trying a bit more then dump it.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I like B&W movies, I can watch Akira Kurosawa , or Ingmar Bergmann without hesitation. I think Pi was a nice try but it was lack of a more background scientific information. I found somewhat ridiculous the set for the super-computer concept, that could have been overlooked if the story was more based on topics such as the bible code or theories like that to compensate. It left me the flavor like they needed to do more research.<br /><br />The most interesting passage is when the young Rabi explain the concept of Hebrew words and numbers. I found it catchy and appealing. The end is somewhat grotesque and opaque to my taste.  As I said, it was a nice try, but at least I did no hate it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I picked the title up on a whim because I remember catching the trailer for the movie, and I'm glad I did. It had been an excellent read, full of great storytelling. Totally worth it
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|Once again, Lady Antebellum have produced another great album.  Every song is a hit and meaningful.  Keep them coming  Lady Antebellum.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I must say it was a slow start...had some trouble with the first 20% of the book. I'm already familiar with the subject matter of OCD so the repetitiveness of explaining it to the reader was a bit much for me. With that being said, I did enjoy the rest of the read. Good book and would recommend it...especially if you've ever been through an abusive relationship, or in one, or are interested in the dynamics of one.
B002DCLQOW|5.0|Watched this series with my daughter when it was on the air. Watched it in reruns! Love the relationships. It is amazing!
0071762345|5.0|Likeable Social Media provides an exciting philosophy for the use of social media. Dave Kerpen seems to really understand this stuff, and he passes along his wisdom in an engaging, fun to read style.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Reasonably priced headset. Exceptionally light, good sound quality. I am not sure how long it would last as it looks fragile. But happy nevertheless with the value for money
B009K0P10K|5.0|if you value free time.  if you like going to sleep on time.  if you have other things to do.  if you enjoy having a life,  then do not watch this show!  surgeon general's warning: this is highly addictive may cause nail biting and have you consumed with fictitious characters, proceed at own risk to social your social life.  side effects include sleeplessness,  asking others if they watch the show and a tendency to lie to yourself by saying 'just one more episode' .
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love everything about this. I have my Grandkids<br />playing/ and Friends. Was a darn good choice.<br />i love it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game and so do my kids. it's very addicting. I would recommend this game to everyone. love.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This series captures the look, sound, and feel of &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34;. A few of the sets and locations are directly from that movie. Each episode has the production value of a full length movie. This is the &#34;before Clarise Starling&#34; storyline with some interesting additions and twists. If you liked &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34; you will probably love this &#34;Hannibal&#34; series.
B001G9FFKY|5.0|Excellent sound quality, vinyl was clean and scratch free, but I cleaned it anyways before listening.  Nice heavy vinyl, good quality set.  Am very pleased.
B0000844M8|5.0|Wanted to share this movie with our grandkids. Except for the opening credits, which were fuzzy, the movie was pretty clear and sharp. The acting is a bit stilted but the story about Elsa the lioness is still great.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Solid acting, great idea behind it, great pace and connections/logical threads tying it into one big, good story. Liked it more than I thought I would. May improve on second view. Third not so good. But story improves if you approach it twice. It does NOT have the \\"watch all the time\\" quality like Mission Impossible (the first one), or Die Hard (first one), but it is fast-moving, good story, good-triumphs-over-evil story.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This movie took me back to my childhood with all of the references to old-school video games like Qbert. My nephew is having a party with this as his theme and I watched it so that I would have an idea what to purchase for his gift. So glad I did.  Sarah Silverman is absolutely hilarious!
B005KAH7QU|3.0|Good premise, solid actors. Moved a bit quickly such that it seemed a bit more discombobulated than tightly coherent. For example, that &#34;hippie&#34; British couple and their 12-year old going on 'starlet' daughter was poorly developed. And that the little boy betrayed her location because he thought he was the special friend of Hanna, but found out after the weird kissing scene that Hanna liked the 'starlet' daughter better (out of disappointment/spite)...It was too frenetic. Too many stars fighting for face time? Best scenes hit the editing room floor?
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|I thought this ap would help me convert iPhone movies so I could watch them on my Kindle Fire HD. I would love to view the clips my sister sends of my nephew, but this ap either can't do it or I don't have an advanced enough understanding of technology to do this. I thought it would be as simple as opening the file with the ap; but it it nothing like that. Wish I could get my &#34;coins&#34; back.  :-(
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was really good and hard to put down. So many emotions and feelings were brought up in this book. Definitely a must read
B008OM0EDO|3.0|It is just ok, it has some funny moments but silly movie overall. I would not purchase it, no more words required.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|The most powerful movie I have ever watched. It is a must see movie for anyone who enjoys any movies.
B00701QV8W|1.0|JA is a case lesson in sixties groups who took too much drugs and took themselves too seriously. The JA made one great album----Surrealistic Pillow. That album is still one of the greatest albums of the sixties. After that, they went downhill swiftly. \\"Volunteers\\" is simply a load of incoherent, leftist-hippie nonsense. Lines like \\"all your private property is target for your enemy\\" from \\"We Can Be Together\\" and so on must have really made everyone outside their hippie, drug-induced bubble shake with fear. And \\"we are outlaws in the eyes of America\\" was more like they were all nitwits in the eyes of America. The decision after SP to take themselves seriously and go full-bore hippie/leftist political made all subsequent musical efforts junk. There's a reason why they still play \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\" on the radio. They were excellent rock songs with musicality and great singing. Does anybody remember any other songs from JA after that other than \\"Miracles\\" from the seventies? I rest my case. The only sop I'll give to \\"Volunteers\\" is that as bad as it was, it wasn't as bad as the truly horrific \\"Crown Of Creation.\\"
1476712042|5.0|This book was soo good. I couldnt put this book down and i was sad when it was over then i found out there was another one coming. I cant wait!!! These are the kind of books that i never want to end. You will not be disappointed!!!!
B002CMQS1O|5.0|I taught a heavy metal unit in Sociology, and I showed this and had the students list the elements of metal being mocked in this mockumentary. My students loved it, and the movie is good enough and detailed enough, I didn't mind watching it with the three sections I teach. &quot;Goes to eleven&quot; and the Stonehenge stage set broght down the house every time I showed it. Classic!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Inspiring and wonderful in every way. It made me think and it made me cry and the story was lovely. Definitely makes it into my list of favorites.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|confusing no real story a big disappointment. too bad the W brothers couldn't pull this one off. not worth the effort.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|At last Rodriguez is recognized for the writing and performing genius he is!  It's been a long time coming, but finally this artist is achieving the fame and recognition he has so long deserved.  This album is beautifully written and sung and I can't wait to get more of his work.
B004X2M9VY|2.0|I think Matt Smith will successfully kill this franchise after 50 years. Too bad old chap! You just don't emote the complexities of the Doctor.
B0065GC0PG|5.0|Great book. A very interesting spin on Cinderella. I love sci-fi and this is an interesting mesh of the two. Fast paced action with some romance thrown in. I couldn't put it down.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|In order for a movie to mean something to me<br />It has to have character development, I need to see morals and values in the main character, action, and a successful outcome. This movie<br />Will not disappoint you!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Actual game charcters and legit nerd culture references made this film a fun rental for two children of the 80's and their little future gamer alike.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|I have loved this quirky, original series since watching it in the 1990's. I bought the VHS then the original DVD (with the European ending) & the remaining episodes. When I found this on Amazon Prime in HD I was skeptical. Am now watching the series and the detail & coloring is remarkable, almost as if seeing it anew.<br />So, If your a fan of this series watch it all over again with a hot &#34;cup o' joe & a slice of cherry pie&#34;. You won't regret it.
0979019710|5.0|Hal Elrod gives you such positive vibes first thing in the morning. It's a great way to start your day! I'm not finished with it yet, but it definitely brings about such a positive outlook to my day!
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Definitely a start-to-finish album as in you can listen to the whole cd without skipping a track. Alt-J have such a unique sound, I hope more people discover their wonderful music. Looking forward to more from these guys!
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|I thought this band rocks and am excited to get this album so I can check out how they evolved.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I saw this movie opening day with some friends and I was at the edge of my seat most of the time, eager for the next scene. Quentin Tarantino never disappoints and he certainly doesn't with this one. Great acting and overall storyline. Highly recommend!
B008L5FFP6|4.0|First heard this band on the radio and I ordered the album the next day.  Would love to see them live one day soon.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I did enjoy reading this trilogy however I must say that the last installment was pretty gruesome. The ending was sweet but overall this  book was a bit of a downer to read. If there was a fourth book to the series I'm not sure if I'd continue. It's good where it is.
B007PKDW44|5.0|I first heard about this band and thought they rocked.  I can't wait for them to come around to see them live.
193700788X|5.0|This book is so great!  I was afraid it would end with a whimper instead of a bang, but it is just as good as each of the previous books.  I'm not going to spoil the ending, but I was really really happy with the whole book, including the ending.  I think that Sookie makes the best choice possible for her life and love, and I was really proud of her!!  (Yes, I know she's a character in a book.) I'm going to really miss Sookie et al, and I am planning on getting the follow up book,letting us all know what happens after to the rest of the people/shifters/vampires, etc., that matter to us from before.  My only problem is, I read it too fast, now I've run out of Sookie!  Maybe I'll go back and read them all again.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Let me start by saying that I absolutely love this album. I can honestly say that I have a new favorite album, and can't wait for my LP to get here!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I thought everyone did a nice job singing and it was funny along the way. Interest ed to see how they will shape the sequel...
B0026KX5PO|4.0|A clever and intriguing movie, well acted and directed (and beautifully filmed), but not your usual point of view. Novelist Patricia Highsmith, upon whose novels this is based, did not feel the villains in  books (or movies) necessarily had to get their comeuppance in the end, since they didn't always in real life either. So Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a scoundrel, but an oddly likable one, and as the movie progresses, the viewer finds himself rooting for him - and Dickie, whom he impersonates, is a real crud, so one doesn't feel sorry for him as one might otherwise. This sort of reminded me of Dexter, where the usual values get all turned around, but it works. Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but I liked it a lot.
B00846WWVM|4.0|But, it's challenging too.  I have to work at the levels to pass them, and they are not all easy! Try it!
B004IPPINW|3.0|The beginning was slow but then it picked up.  I was surprised when the ending came.  I thought I had another chapter or two.
B00BN2NY48|5.0|So out of the ordinary.  I was very impressed and watched it a second time, which i rarely do! Thanks!
B0055ECA3G|4.0|Every robot lover should watch this movie! This is a classic. I think the second one may be a little better.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This was a good film, and so in keeping with all the other Hobbit films.  I liked it a lot!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Product was described well in the video.  Really like the magnetic switch and the adjustable tilt for reading.  Excellent value for the price.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|I watch an episode when I have time here and there and it's pretty easy to keep track of.  I like that it always has a new twist on every episode!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Though I would agree there are many other amazing books by Grisham available, I enjoyed the change of pace of this book.  Grisham's books are always so serious, that the humor in this book was a pleasant surprise. I would recommend this book!
B005GIS1WA|4.0|When I took my kids to see Rio, I didn't expect it to be anything that I would particularly want to watch again and again.  But I was pleasantly suprised.  The animation was very clear.  The characters were well developed.  The story had a good, positive message.  I also appreciated that the language was clean and the lewd humor was kept to a minimum.  I particularly enjoyed the music.  I purchased this movie for an upcoming road trip.  We had seen Rio quite some time ago, but I knew my kids would enjoy seeing it again and again.
B005544V6A|5.0|I watched the pilot and it sucked me in. Fantastic cast... characters you love to love and love to hate. Great witty banter and perfect chemistry, especially between the main characters. I ended up watching both seasons in one weekend. Highly recommend!!
B007TKT2SK|4.0|This is a great app to use when you need to double a recipe or cut a recipe in half.
B000VWSINI|5.0|He came out swing on this release!!! The  Eminem Show is a great album!! The Marshall Mathers LP is true force to be reckon with!!! It's a hard album to follow!! I love this album.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|I REALLY wanted to hate this band, mostly because they came along during the whole Twilight craze and anything &#34;vampire&#34; was a turn-off. But after seeing them perform on SNL, I figured I'd give them a shot.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Obvious Bicycle caught me right away. And then Unbelievers. And on and on...<br /><br />Really good CD. Really good music. Really good band.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Eighth season of Supernatural is awesome as expected, not to mention, Dean is looking just as gorgeous as ever and Sam not to shabby either.
B009PHRIKE|5.0|Jean-Luc Ponty's first 5 solo albums reflect great songwriting,intricate arrangements,virtuoso performances and great sounding production. H eis one of the greatest all time musicians...and his music spans jazz, rock and classical...great melodies and brilliant playing
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great. Can not wait for the next season. Great first thseason. I might even watch it again before going the next season.
B00CW665VI|1.0|Predictable. Only good if you like lots of sex with instructions. I am not going to pay much attention anymore to customer reviews. Plus, it's told first person and that's not a favorite of mine. I wonder if Amazon would give me my money back.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I Love Based On A True Story! I Love every song on it. It was well worth my money. I would recommend it to anyone that Loves Blake Shelton. And anyone that Loves Country music!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Haven't once watched The Good Wife, during the first 5 seasons.  Now I'm hooked.  With Amazon Prime, I can watch back to back seasons.  I really enjoy this show!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was truly amazing. As a young person in today's world, it is sometimes easy to miss the small gestures of love that others do for us. This book shows the beauty of those small gestures of love. The love that the 2 main characters shared in such a short amount of time is something that only a handful of us will be able to enjoy. Go and read this book. Totally worth it.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Mumford & Sons delivers a great follow up album for their sophomore effort. If you like their first album this is definitely going to please.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|This app is really fun! It is kind of hard to get the controls right the first couple of times you try to fly a plane but after that it feels like a real remote control airplane!
B009R659L8|5.0|Twists and turns and murders galore!  Who dunnit?  Tie all the pieces together and the answer will surprise you.  Another thriller from Mary Higgins Clark.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This app is fun but it gets annoying because you run out of gas for your car a lot which makes you fail the level you are on...
B003L77G38|5.0|Sci-fi drama at it's best, Fringe was one of the best shows on television.  Not much else to it, really.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I adored the book and te movie was a great adaptation. Nicholas Hoult warms the soul, even as a zombie. Not a hard-hitting drama or social commentary by any means, but a great movie nonetheless.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I was excite to own this movie. I own the book and love it, now I have the first part to the movie and can watch it too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I intentionally saw the movie first, and then read the book.  For the most part, the movie followed the book very closely, and I was very tempted to buy books 2 and 3 - but want to wait until after seeing each movie so that I can completely enjoy the movie experience.  Now I know that all the Hunger Games buzz was for real!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book amazed me. It was a ray of hope in a pile of junk I've read lately. The characters are real and heartbreakingly beautiful.
B008ROG1QI|4.0|While not particularly accurate, the 25th and last mission of the Memphis Belle though dramatized is a good view of the famous plane and the crews that bombed Germany even though they knew the odds were against them ever reaching the final mission that would result in their being sent home. The special effects aren't spectacular and the soundtrack is distorted but it's still worth watching.<br /><br /> I still &#34;crank the volume&#34; during the takeoff roll.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|Loved this movie. Full of hot actors, amazing dancing and not a bad plot line! This movie makes me want to stand up and dance and do everything in the movie!
B005HEK3JW|4.0|Classic Star Trek fare for the fans of the series.  If you are not a fan, you won't like it.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I'm happily addicted to this show! If you're a theatre nerd and/or love music, this is the show for you! The singing is superb and there is just enough cat fights to keep it interesting! Great mix of drama and content!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Loved this ending to a great series.  It did tie up a lot of ends too quickly/easily but other than that; thank you Charlaine.  Be true to yourself.<br /><br />***Spoiler***  Never \\"got\\" her continued Eric attachment; I thought she was too smart for that.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I loved this, it is the best of the three so far...Now, where is book number four?...No one can leave you hanging like Jeffrey Archer...Fantastic....Put me on the waiting list for the next book!I understand there will be five!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife, and it is a very nice date movie! It is funny and poignant, and a really enjoyable movie to watch over and over again! Highly recommended!
B002QYNIHU|5.0|THIS FIGURE IS AMAZING! By far the greatest Goku figure out there! Comes with a neutral face and a screaming one. He comes with an instant transmission hand, two blast hands, and two kamehameha hands. I'd also recommend getting cell for the kamehameha wave effect part!
6305451591|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife, and it is a very nice and touching movie! It is funny and poignant, and a really enjoyable movie to watch over and over again! Highly recommended!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Interesting game with nice puzzles and a relatively linear storyline to play. Good graphics and  music.  Certainly value for money.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|If you want to play a wonderfully fun and thrilling little app that won't bruise your kidneys then Hill Climb Racing comes highly recommended. But you better hang onto your watches, wigs, and wallets as you bounce, flip, and grind over a variety of increasingly difficult terrain. And while you're at it, collect gold coins and additional fuel along the way to buy vehicle upgrades to better complete your journey. But be warned, one false move and you can easily flip your ride and break your neck! Overall, this is an addicting little app that provides great fun and is hard to put down. Yer gonna love it!
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I know many of you SACD lovers will disagree with me but I bought this album in LP Vinyl years ago and until you've heard Mark Knopfler's guitar the way it was meant to be reproduced, you haven't heard Knopfler. SACD seems to have fizzled out or at best the titles are limited and it is too bad because I did here some great albums recorded in SACD but for my money Knopfler sounds best on analog vinyl.  Don't get me wrong, I have over 700 albums in CD format along with my vinyl collection but if you can find a good clean vinyl edition of this great album do yourself a favor, have it cleaned either professionally or at least with a spin-clean and treat your ears to this wonderful timeless recording. You'll hear things on vinyl that the compression inherent in CDs rolls off.  Long live analog and long live vinyl.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Time may be irrelevant and this latest Stewart cd is as big as an elephant. It carries that classic Rod Stewart thumbprint all through out it. These tunes that can be categorize from Rock to Pop and Ballads along with a classic rock song that echoes the feel of the Mercury record days. Many songs on this cd have the added depth of being some what autobiographical. To rob a line from Bobby Darin, &#34;Look Out Ol' Rod is BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />-Jimmy Scalia-
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Encompassing all that fascinates us about the history of the British class system in a fully engaging piece of entertainment.
B00000DGUY|1.0|It was too scratched to play. I ended up throwing it away. They didn't look at it at all. jdcennwcn
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|.....that will not disappoint. The story telling, and directing are mesmirizing. You will lose yourself in this script. What a story about Hollywood and the fight for control. Shawn Penn was brilliant! He disappeared into the character.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i loved? minecraft but there are still flaws like the water needs some programing WE NEED BUCKETS and more land some of my freinds maxed out there whole world and needed more space there waiting for the update that makes the land bigger so they can continue to play and you'll need to build a very bright house in this game because when u have a little house and u walk out at night u get swamped
B005HEFB6M|3.0|It's fun to see a Star Trek show where technology isn't quite as &#34;magical&#34; as all the other shows were.  Not to say that the writers still don't see technology as the magic wand that will solve all problems, but this show seems a little closer to home.  They're still recycling all the old themes -- it's &#34;bad&#34; to help people in a bad spot if it might affect their &#34;natural development&#34;.  (This is the writers trying to lay a foundation for one Star Trek's stupider creations -- the Prime Directive.)  I also get tired of the writer's persistent liberal bias -- the last episode we watched was rabidly anti-hunting and pro-vegetarian.  Get real!  I don't watch shows like this because I want to be propagandized!
B00CF2UORK|5.0|We always enjoy watching all of the Shaun the Sheep characters.  In fact, we watch them over and over and over ...
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Needed an alarm while travelling. This did the trick when I left my cell phone at work. Love that the Kindle does so much!!
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Season 1 was more interesting, this Season 2 has some chapters as good as first Season but it seems that the imagination and new  trials have descend in having that light that make us wanting to see more. Hope it improves on next season.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I have read the Redwall series , the Eragon series, the Percy Jackson series, the Inkheart series and the Septimus Heap series. This is an easy read and was just as awesome as the others. Looking forward to the rest of this series.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Pretty riveting drama although a bit slow paced at times.  This series may set a record though for f bombs per minute, most of which are not necessary for effect and demonstrate a low opinion of the highest level of government officials.
B0061QD82E|4.0|The product arrived within a few days of my order.  It was not overly packaged; the mailman was able to place it in my mail slot.  I believe I ordered a used product, but it seemed new.  Pricing was excellent.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|wow this book was really differnt. I have never read anything like it before. I think you know its a good book when you remember it clearly months later. I found the collection of photos throughout the book facinating and on a tablet had no problems seeing them clearly. I really reccomend this book to anyone who likes to be suprised when they are reading
B00000331V|4.0|I'm giving this four stars only because personally I find Peter Wolf's pattering monologues annoying.  Every other aspect of this album is perfect, solid songs throughout, great solos, all of it is well done.  Even the audiences (the concert was recorded over two nights, one in Detroit's Cobo Hall and the other at Boston Garden) are so into the music that they seem to add to the album.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|More challenging than Windows. Part of the problem is the facecards are harder to differentiate so it takes a longer time to finish.
B00005K9QP|5.0|Sonny Boy Williamson once said of the Yardbirds, \\"Those English kids want to play the blues so bad, and they play the blues so bad.\\"  This album proves him wrong.  Former Yardbird Eric Clapton had moved far ahead in that short time and demonstrates his virtuosity on the guitar on every single track.<br /><br />The album doesn't break a lot of new ground, most of the songs are blues standards (and even a remake of Ray Charles's \\"What I Say,\\") what makes it so amazing are Clapton's (and sometimes Mayall's)solos.  This is an album to showcase the incredible musicianship of the Blues Breakers.
B0088W4YTK|4.0|The show has sympathetic characters, and some pretty plot twists.They are not totally dependent on the vampires in space idea.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is the gold standard for all confessional singer-songwriters before or since.  There's nothing that has ever been this open or honest and yet still radio friendly.  The album was written at a tough time for Joni Mitchell, and it shows in the content of the song.  Most are sad, and even the more upbeat ones have bittersweet lines about longing or desire.<br /><br />While Joni takes some cues from jazz here; it's not at all an experimental album.  The tracks have the barest of accompaniment.  It's Mitchell's voice and her lyrics that carries this one.
B004FUPK3I|5.0|The second in the 'three mothers' trilogy,Dario Argento once again plunges us into a dreamlike world where we must simply let go and enjoy the ride!
0307341577|4.0|Good read and shows how Flynn has evolved in her writing.  Also purchased Sharp Objects, her other book.  Good value
B001F4UHGC|5.0|I lived in San Francisco about the same time this great classic was filmed.  It's hard to believe how much it has changed.
0307341550|4.0|Liked seeing hour Gillian Flynn has evolved in her writing skills.  This and &#34;Dark Places&#34; are great starters for &#34;Gone Girl&#34; a very good read.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I enjoyed this book. Being about a shipwreck castaway, the fact that it dragged at times is a testament to the writing. Yann Martel creates an incredibly believable sense of loneliness. Having said that, I spent much of the middle section thinking, \\"Okay, I get it\\" and wanting to move on.<br /><br />If you like adventures, this is for you. I won't likely re-read this one, though.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is very busy,lots to be done. Definitely too complicated for young children,better for adults. Still learning how to battle but so far it's fun.
B006Z949XY|5.0|good movie for the kids... i already had part 1 so i got part 2. hopefully a part 3 comes out
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Awesome, addictive, spellbinding!!!  Couldn't put my kindle down.  Loved every episode.  Can't wait to see the next episode!  Love seeing it on kindle instead of week to week.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  We expected it to be crude and not very funny,  but it turned out to be crude, medium funny, and actually kind of touching in some scenes.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Just like her other CD, she honest and real! Love this one, she's amazing musically and personally. Would definitely buy this CD.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Great, funny comedy, can recommend it to anyone who likes funny movies. It kind of uses explicit language in some cases, but above 12/14 years of age it should be fine to watch for anyone.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game. This game is addicting!  Once I get started I just want to keep playing. It doesn't get boring.
B00BHU9CCO|5.0|cute and fun movie, we had to watch it four times the first weekend.  Our three year old loved the monsters.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love the charactersand their developoing story lines within the season.  Love Peter, quack, quack, quack.  Walter shows great vulnerability and disturbing thought processes, he is fun character to follow.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Got this book after remembering how much I loved reading it to my baby brother years and years ago.  Now, my three year old LOVES it.  The whole family had tons of fun acting all surprised.  Our toddler has &#34;read&#34; it to all of us.
B002QZ399G|2.0|Thought it might be good but just never seemed to get going. Never would watch again since I can't even remember the gist of it. Made no impression.
B00B2DSIAI|3.0|Our 3yo saw the Wreck It Ralph gun in the disney store and had to have it.  He loves shooting the bugs.  We got the movie thinking he would enjoy seeing his gun in action.  Not so much so....  Did not keep his attention at all, but the adults all enjoyed the retro gaming look.
B0084670FU|1.0|It is amazing what these guys can get money to makie. Don't waste your time. There may have been a good idea in there but it never made it to the screen.
B003FSTN52|5.0|I love this series!  I have recommended it to all my friends!!  I have worked in a law firm and thoroughly enjoyed the office politics and the court scenes.  Well written and acted.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|This movie is awesome, the animation is stunning, story and characters grab you. I grinned for the first 10 minutes and usually smile through most of it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I HAVE TO SEE THE HULK IN 3 D I KNOW IT WILL BE GREAT. NOW SOME POPCORN AND THE HULK 3 D. THANK YOU
B008LFY6NI|3.0|I gives u this need to eat food to settle your stomach after a while... I hope I'm not the only one that happens to...
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|It work flawless as expected. The only thing is, the battery won't fit smoothly. You have to juggle it for like 5 min before it fits.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can play this game for hours!!!  Little too hard to get to level 9 though, where u can get the powerful that gives u two gems when u fill up your coin meter...
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This whole series is very well done.  It's addictive as all heck and it follows the book extremely well.  Brilliant screenwriting and acting; HBO isn't afraid of delivering the gore.
B005V20JKI|3.0|This has AWESOME graphics but lacks control. U  can't move well in this game and you can't jump over the sheep so they kill you automatically which makes you have to start the game over a bunch of times. DON'T LIKE THIS GAME.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|I wasn't sure if this would work or not.  I have an iSimple in my car, and I recently got a extra battery case for my iPhone4, which monopolizes the 30pin port the iSimple needs.  I was looking at all sorts of adapters, but couldn't feel confident any of them would transmit audio correctly.  Then I came across this, read good reviews and had optimism.  And it worked fine on first attempt!  Great little piece of technology.  Also, when upgrading to iPhone5, I can still use it (which if I'd gone with a non bluetooth adapter, but a 30pin to microUSB, it wouldn't).
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Good story line with characters that youngsters can easily relate to. Might be a bit too scary for 2-4 yr olds.
B008S8488Q|5.0|MUY BUEN PRODUCTO
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Such a beautifully done movie and well deserving of the awards.  Best movie I've seen in a long time!  Highly recommend.  Have tissues at hand :-)
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Keeps one engaged and interested. Tom is always worth a watch and never fails to entertain.See it for yourself today.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|If you intend to read Khaled Hosseini's third novel And the Mountains Echoed and you're expecting something along the lines of his first two blockbusters (The Kite Runners and A Thousand Splendid Suns), you won't get exactly what you're looking for, but I promise it's going to hook you from page one.<br /><br />First off, Hosseini has a style of writing that can be described as nothing short of poetic. He's a master storyteller, and the first chapter was so beautifully written that I knew it would be a matter of days before I'd end up turning the last page and heaving a sigh of regret at having it end so soon.<br /><br />And the Mountains Echoed opens in a tiny village in Afghanistan in the mid 1950s, where a young father is telling a local fairy tale to his two young children. The next day, their lives change irrevocably when they depart for Kabul, starting off a series of events that takes the reader on a journey across the world and spanning several generations of families.<br /><br />\\"So, then. You want a story and I will tell you one. But just the one. Don't either of you ask me for more.\\"<br /><br />But this isn't just one story. It's a collection of nine interconnected stories, all of which have been woven together along parallel themes of family, dependance, loyalty, betrayal, and abandonment. Each story introduces the reader to new members of this first young Afghan family, and to the people whose lives they intermingle with.<br /><br />All in all, a terrific read, and one that I happily recommend.<br /><br />Throughout these stories, we feel sadness and sorrow for these characters, but we also feel compassion, joy and happiness at seeing everything come full circle. Hosseini shows us time and time again with his writing that Afghanistan isn't a country to be reviled or feared, no matter what the media would have us think.<br /><br />America and Afghanistan may be interlocked in their present day stories of war, but we share a common bond in the feelings ofguilt and gratitude that come with being dependent on the people that we care about most in the world. These are feelings that we all share and understand. As with his first two novels, Hosseini does a terrific job of humanizing his beloved homeland of Afghanistan. It's hard not to see this country with different eyes once you've read one of his books.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha still has it after all these years.. you'd think it was still the 70's when Abba was going strong. beautiful and upbeat cd!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Easy to understand and to navigate. Love the ability to just click and be on Facebook and see what all my friends are doing
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Iloved this movie but I am confused about how the demacrats were against freeing the slaves and the republicans were for freeing the slaves.Now republicans are the the ones who fight civil rights and the democrats are pro civil rights. This movie left me confused abought our party system and what they stand for.Fun for a soap opera,poor for a history documentary. I will stay nonpartisan!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I downloaded this movie to watch on the plane ride home from vacation. I thought it was going to be an okay movie but it turned out to be great. Love Josh Brolin in this movie.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Best sit-com on TV currently!!  Makes me want to go buy a Star Trek uniform so I can be like Sheldon. :-)
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Its okay for like fifteen minutes and then your bored. But it's just a demo so it's okay as info if you've never played mindcraft.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Nothing else can be said about thsi show.  Once you're hookked you want more amd then some more.  I hope it runs at least 6 seasons.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I watched this movie like ten times and I still think its funny. My 10yr old son and I watch it when ever we stop at Panera to pick up lunch or dinner. We love most  Adam Sandler movies. Can't wait for Grown ups 2 to come out.
B00AM0C6YG|2.0|This was one of the worst CD I have ever puchased.  The music is somewhere between folk and a wounded animal asking for help.  I'm not sure what the artist or her production team was trying to make  but what ever it was they missed .  I'd love to return this for a refund.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|I watched this on a flight and I still don't know what all the fuss was about this movie. I was bored and couldn't wait for it to be over.
B009POCFTG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it 3 times just tpo make sure I caught all of the dialogue and jsut to laugh out loud aat soem of the wierder moments.  Matthew M. does a good job as Killer Joe and the rest of cast really bring the movie to life.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like it. Very challenging. Keeps me or my son busy while we are at a waiting room or restaurant waiting for our food.
B009T3AHDE|4.0|The movei can be confusing on a turn off on first blush, but stay with it.  The story and plot lines do come togeather, its pacing gets into the right groove, and you get hooked.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|It has it quirks and issues, but Hannibal is still a very good program.  I had to own it now rather than waiting for the Blu Ray.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Just watched this movie with my g-friend and her mother last night for the 4th time. Denzell and cast are wonderful; John Goodman as a drug dealer was pitch perfect, and the whole idea of going  from Hero and Zero within the space of one drink is well thought out, good pace, and jarring at times.  Don Cheldle and Bruce Green Wood both deliver knock out performacne , but it is Denzell's performacne that take the cake.
B0058SNIC6|4.0|Feel Like the original original style but not so ugly.  I wish they came in more interesting color that an older person might wear.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I don't know what else to say, but, excellent I am unable to put the book down.  A real page turner......
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like this app for our weather.  Had TWC's app & didn't like it at all!  It ate up battery life no matter the settings & I couldn't see the radar.  I like be able to check the radar & forecast on on simple screen but it also has many other options.  Choices for what's on your opening screen in the app & what notifications you want.  So far, I love it.
B006PFC2S2|4.0|You can never go wrong with Gene Kelly, and he doesn't disappoint in this one. A little corny, but still great.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|recommending to all my friends and family-constantly had to stop to read parts out loud to my husband-cool use of data.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I've read a Cornwell, a Patterson, and a Kathy Reich book in the past couple weeks.  What's with the brand naming?  I phone, I pad, Camry????  Once I noticed it, all it did was annoy me, not make me want to run out and buy them!  Otherwise, another great Scarpetta novel.
B008UCDDQS|5.0|This is the classic martial arts movie of all time. Enough said.<br /><br />All other martial arts movies that came after it pay tribute in some way to this one, intentionally or otherwise.
0345803493|5.0|The story was very romantic and sweet, hard to put down. I hope the author will continue writing I look forward to further books from her.
1401937519|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I was engrossed with this true life story, from beginning to end.  Thank you Anita for sharing your experience.  I too in my life have had to deal with some major health issues and in my spiritual quest came to some of the conclusions that were similarly confirmed here in the authors explanation of how she felt with her experience.  I highly recommend this book by Anita Moorjani  for anyone dealing with health issues, rather personal or loved one, or contemplating life itself !
0345803507|5.0|The story was very good, it was a book hard to put down, and very romantic.  I hope the author writes a fourth book.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|This new collection of music by Agnetha is a must have for all Agnetha and ABBA fans !  So cool to hear new tunes from this pop icon.  I love this as much as her ' I Stand Alone ' cd in 1987 which in my opinion was most excellent.  I would have given the new cd<br />'A'  a five star rating if it weren't for the annoying track listing flub up....when loaded in computer the track listing info is for the ' I Stand Alone ' cd not for 'A' ... ?  come on quality control, how did this get by ?
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits is a great show that is under supplied, you always are pissed off that you have to wait a whole week until the next episode and then all of a sudden the season is over.  Can't wait for season 3!
B00846REIS|5.0|I really loved the book, so much emotions to share, so much longing, and final exitment. Real good. I am looking forward to the last book of the trilogy, I need to know that Eva and Gideon will be at peace andenjoying each other happily ever after.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Penelope was really quite clean. There was a few utterances of mild crude language; drinking in a few scenes including at a bar; gambling; smoking; kissing; mild clevage; a reference to ancestors in which a woman had cheated on her husband; and a couple of double entendres and sexual innuendos.  It is rated PG and the Dove Foundation approved it for 12+.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again. Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.  Yes I have to admit that for looking like a pig....well, she doesn't.  You only see her nose.  But really, would anyone want to watch this movie if she really looked like a pig and was &#34;scary&#34; or &#34;ugly.  Also, the suitors screaming and running and jumping out the window to get away...again...really???  It makes for a funny, cute movie though.  The story was about the girl learning to like herself for who she is.  Finding out who she really is.  To love and value herself.  She also found a great guy who loved her, despite her &#34;looks&#34; but wants to see her happy, even if it isn't with him.  She even makes him realize that he wants to be better.  Of course she finds out that she can only be happy with him.  And after the spell is broken and she looks &#34;normal&#34;, oddly enough no one recognizes her. :)<br /><br />Overall, love this movie and will watch it again.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is beautiful and captivating!  If you haven't seen the movie, read this book first!  It is a spiritual journey of how one young man deals with the reality and/or fantasy of tragedy!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm not real good at beating my grandson...but give me more practice...then watch out.<br />Fun game for most any age that understands computer games and such!
B0053O89IS|5.0|I do sometime give a bad review,  but I can't with Bones.  I have been  watching this  series sense the beginning.  You will get to know all the characters in this show too.  It is funny, sad, serious and exiting.  Try it, you'll like it.
B003YUS7GW|2.0|I am a huge fan of Crocs brand soles, but the design of these and the fabric used for the upper portion is a killer.  They crowd the toes and the fabric is stiff and irritating.  I washed them and used extra softener to see if I could make them comfortable.  Didn't work.  I'm going to cut the toe area out in hopes of re-engineering. Sorry, Crocs, but this one is not a winner.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Another great show.  I have watched this until the two main characters have finally gotten together.  It is kind of like moonlighting which I loved too.  But it is a show of its own too.  I recommend it too.
B000I8HIV8|5.0|This movie is great for the whole family. The kids love it and we could watch it over and over.
B0001I561E|4.0|I love alladin but this dvd is very fake,  not made by disney....the dvd works fine but the cover looks like I printed it myself from my computer.
B0050ACYHM|4.0|Before reading Michael Connelly's novel, I passed over Lincoln Lawyer on the big screen and now regret. However, this courtroom thriller plays well as a DVD for home entertainment and does a nice job of mirroring plot progress of the book. McConaughey fit my vision of Mickey Haller, and I'd like to see movie sequels for this Mickey Haller book series. (For those just getting started with Connelly books, Mickey is the half brother of the longer book series starring Detective Harry Bosch.)
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Just what my mom wanted for her Birthday!  She loved it.  It came in perfect condition.  It's a great series.
B000000Y27|5.0|The incredible skills of Wes Montgomery will live on in jazz history. In the mid 60s I became familiar with his music. With this CD he validates the title, The Incredible Jazz Guitar. Which is a more classic straight ahead jazz approach compared to the octaves played in the 60s which became his signature style. Like Herby Hancock and Ramsey Lewis he brought FM music to the AM radio band then. This CD was recorded before  he introduced pop tunes to jazz attracting a young audience to the art form. I knew he was a great jazz guitarist, but was unaware that his skills were so diverse. In a few words...the man was great! I'm glad I added this one to my collection.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This show has it all- gorgeous costumes, witty rapport, tragic love stories... It can kind of drag on at times, but the emotional investment definitely pays off!
B000059TEP|5.0|Guys,cuddle up with your girl and skip the popcorn. And have a large box of Kleenex. This movie will jerk the tears right out of her eyes to the tune of an \\"Unchained Melody\\".(...and maybe yours too). It is highly emotional! Especially for those who  like romantic tear jerkers, buy it and see for yourself. And the suspense is great also.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|I bought this item off B and H since I could not  find it  around where I live ! BIG MISTAKE !!! At first it does look well built but my promblem was the rivet at the back where the back screw secure the top plate pop out ?? The way it s build is stupid there is nothing to keep the thing in ? After 3 h of trying to balance it with my Sony and looking at all the tutorials on the web I finally  used it  and it last about 3h10 min , so 3h of balance and 10  of use?? B and H take care of you for 1 month  ( I am not using a steadycam just for fun everyday ) so it was 2 month when i called they ask me to go to Opteka , 3 weeks later 12 emails, 2 calls  and it took another call to finally have a answer that I had to pay back  transport to send it back and to get a new one ( a new one why ???) and it s going to cost me 1/3  of the price of the item in transport. B and H on there side dont took care of it since the 1 month policy was over and they dont have the item in stock ... Wow !!! I will never buy any other items from any of those retailer. My point is it s not like a pair of shoes that you wear everyday ( even) it's not normal that the thing break in such a short period of time , total rip off and next time I will buy something where i CAN HAVE SUPPORT AND COMMON SENSE.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|This book is a very fast rad. Not the best book I have read but it is good. You can't go wrong with Nicholas sparks!
B001LX2J22|5.0|Though this was the 4th release, it is actually the first part, chronologically.  It is a remake/redo of Manhunter, which did come out first and occurs first chronologically, but apparently did not do well.  This movie helps to fill in gaps of information about how/why Hannibal is in prison; however, it does not focus on his crime spree that lead him there.  That would be a good movie.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|It reminds me of The Goonies but british... with aliens... and weed..  Umm maybe not so much like the Goonies I guess.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Love the album, has a few serious notes that give great, positive messages however their is a lot of fun music on the album. I love the My Oh My song, such nostalgia for me personally. Instead of the hard ass tough guy like Eminem, Macklemore is a fun rapper that loves his fans and shows it. Buy it, you won't regret it.
0865478007|5.0|Ben Goldacre has a nice easy to read and engaging writing style.  The topics found in the book are quite enlightening.  Everything from finding out about the sales of prescription data in the US so pharma companies can see what drugs doctors are prescribing (in order to better sell their drugs to specific doctors) to how Pharma companies influence patient groups, academic papers and doctors.  It's all laid out simply and with specific steps of what can be done to solve these problems depending on your position (industry insider, doctor, patient, concerned citizen, etc).<br /><br />The only thing I think some people might find annoying is that he tends to repeat points in various chapters or sometimes within the same chapter.  It's all done to emphasize and I think to improve the memorability of some of the concepts but some people might find the duplication annoying.
B005IQZB14|4.0|THIS IS A VERY GOOD STORY. I THINK she was selfish by using heroin and her immoral acts. She is a very brave woman. She learns and becomes a better person. She is a very good writer. This book has inspired me.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|This sas a good rent.  My kids liked it and it seemed to follow the same plot as the DSI game.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|The best movie I have seen in the past year. By far.<br />It is surprisingly very very funny.<br />I recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading The Hunger Games to get my friends off my back. I was constantly told I would love the book and the series but was skeptical. In the end my friends were right. I read this book in 26 hours (my family did have to eat) before moving on to the rest of the series.
B002EX7GBC|4.0|I thought this was a cute movie. It was a little dark at times, but the story is a little dark. My 9 year old enjoyed the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not sure I need to explain why you need to read this book. If you've read the first two I'm surprised you're reading this review and not this book! Buy Mockingjay and find out how it all ends!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Just as much fun as the first one.  This game is  crack. I would recommend this game to everyone  it's so much fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games I had no idea how two more books could add to the story. Catching Fire adds a twist and keeps you begging for more. A great read and a great book to return to again and again.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I haven't finished the book yet but am enjoying it.  We all know people like Amy and I look forward to the ending.<br />I finished the book and the ending was dumb.  The story was good but the end was very weak.
B008ROELL0|5.0|Michael Douglas at his best. A real look at a man living out his dark side. Funny, tragic but definitely entertaining.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I really meant to watch this show when it started because I love Chris Noth so I was glad to have the opportunity to see it without having to buy CDs that I'm not going to look at again.  The first season was awesome.  I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline as well as the characters.
B007QVLKI2|5.0|I was initially drawn in by the addictive &#34;Little Talks&#34;, but I'm loving every song on here - they have a great and unique sound, and this has definitely held up over repeated listenings.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  There is an amazing level of detail.  However, it requires a commitment to finish the book because of that detail.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|As long as I'm next to my daughter reading everything that pops up she does not play it. Wish is had audio. The app keeps locking up my kindle too and I have to restart.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I never really liked Pac Man in the arcade- I dug Ms. Pac Man. But Pac Man on Kindle just sucks. Very difficult to maneuver.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Didn't care for it, I thought it sucked! The best part of the movie was the witchery parts! I wouldn't recommend it.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love this series, it really does have it all, drama, humor and inteligence.  Very good performances by everyone and wonderfully directed.  Grown up fare at last.  It's just an awfully good show. IMOP
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love it the game is fun but does not show u the pictures and I wish there were more peoplenbut other wise great and just to warn u its very addicting
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Great to see the original series looking so good!  VERY enjoyable!  This alone is a great reason to be an Amazon Prime member!
B002NNA9N0|2.0|I find this movie rather boring and rude. There is way too much verbal vulgarity for the average movie goer.  The scenes are retro in movie going and there is not too much activity with the scenes.  There are great actors with a narrow subject base to work with. I'm thinking it was probably overpriced to produce and doesn't have the bang,pizazz and interest to hold a snail in a state of interest.  I think 2 stars is still a stretch.<br /><br />Thanks for listening to My Opinion. :&#62;)
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|The following are the highlights of the major differences between the Extended Cut and the Theatrical Cut.  The Extended Cut runs approximately 4 minutes longer and does NOT add any significantly new scenes.  Action scenes remain the same, gore remains the same, and the previously filmed fight scene in front of parked SUVs has not been re-inserted either.<br /><br />SPOILERS FOLLOW BELOW<br /><br />1) McClane shoots at the paper target at the police shooting range a little longer, while cursing his son.<br /><br />2) All scenes involving Lucy McClane have been excised.  So no more beginning scene of Lucy driving John to the airport or meeting her dad and brother at the end of the movie.<br /><br />3) A few extra scenes of John walking through the demonstration at Moscow.<br /><br />4) The highway chase scene is a little better cut.<br /><br />5) A few new quick shots of the assault on the CIA safehouse.<br /><br />6) A few new quick shots of Irina and the ballroom gunfight.  Slightly clearer how Jack is able to retrieve his gun-knife.<br /><br />7) There is now a dead body in the trunk of the car that Jack steals outside of the club.<br /><br />8) A couple extra sentences of conversation regarding Chernobyl between John & Jack.<br /><br />And there you have it, no major changes in the Extended Cut.  Despite ADGtDH's good performance at the box office, I was disappointed by what is clearly the weakest link of the Die Hard series.  From boring dialogue \\"I'm on vacation\\" to generic villains, there is nothing Die Hard about this latest edition.  I liked Jai Courtney as Varro in Spartacus, but the script gives him nothing to work with.  Characters are one-dimensional.  There's very little reason to care about Jack McClane, and there was no real father-son bond other than a few humorous quips.<br /><br />Le sigh.  Let's just hope they don't screw up Die Hard 6.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Back to the expected Connelly novel. Bosch is back on the job; hopefully there are real detectives as savvy as he is.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Hard to win, although it is fun to play.  Different rooms break the monotony.  Not my favorite among all the bingo games I play.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love the sookie stackhouse series so sad it had to end but at least we have the show true blood to tie us over!
B005544TRQ|5.0|My husband would even watch this with me! He liked it much better than Gold Rush.....that's a no brainier. A must see!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like it. It's fun. I have gotten hung up on a couple of the levels, that tookme a while to get. One was the boot.
B00005LAGO|5.0|I was thrilled to reunite with this old friend!<br /> Having had this disk in the early 90’s, and losing it along the way, it was great to find. This has some of the best Pixies tracks.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|tucking hillarious... killing fools... taking cars, more killing... I've got this game on two different devises.... I like it a lot on the kindle fire
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|We have ordered all 3 seasons and love having them at our fingertips to watch over and over. It can't get any better than that!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|the game uses lots of online game play but at least it has offline game play if it had more offline games then i would rate it higher so if you have face book and friends then it is worth your time
B006I1OB0U|5.0|What a wonderful classic the Downton Abbey is, and this Christmas special was great. I bought an extra to give as a Christmas gift!
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Very sweet movie and I would and have recommended to several friends already.<br /><br />Loved, Loved, Loved it!!!!! Best Movie I've seen this year so far.
B002DR3WG2|5.0|I never thought I could fall in love with prose from the 18th century! A book that allows time travel. Love.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Best series ever.  Only one season, but the writing was superb.  If wishes were horses, we'd all be eatin' steak....
0446579939|3.0|I really couldn't wait to dive into the book, considering I love the movie. The characters were unique and struggling with real life issues.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the contrasting events between the book and the movie. IE. The messy crab house first date. The wartime events Logan needs to cope with his friend Victor. Also, the fact that Logan knows more and can tell more about Beth's ex-husband.<br /><br />Though the book held my attention through the whole beginning and middle, I felt like the end dragged. One scene was skipping to another scene and it seemed very choppy. I wasn't sure if that was intended...<br />All in all, I give a 3 stars.
B0091WD4ZQ|4.0|This movie transported my middle-aged self back to the glory days when meeting my soul mate on a train \\"could have been\\". I liked that the characters were so honest with each other and they had great chemistry on the screen. I look forward to watching the sequel.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|has many translations of the bible, most of which have accompanying audio. i definitely prefer it on my kindle fire to reading my eBook bible. navigation is so easier
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is great! It is just great and because it is So low in development but so good I h highly recommend you buy this at once.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app. I use it everyday on my kindle fire. it is a lot easier to use and manage than going on the web browser. I think it is better than it as well. sometimes is can be slow but is usually asks if I want to force quit it and open again, it does not take long for it to reopen.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater (even in HFR), but it's amazing to see on blu-ray on a plasma TV. If you get a chance to see it, do so.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game people call me a geek but I told them to play and they did and they loved it when is your next update
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I absoulutley think this game is a Hay Day!<br />I rated this 5 &#34;Stars&#34; because once you start playing the game you are already addicted to the first day you get the game.  You will want to play when you wake up and when you go to bed.<br />This product is for all ages to have fun.
B009PHRIAE|5.0|The recording quality isn't the finest some parts suffer from this but Brüggen is a legend and so are leonhardt,,Bylsma, Harnoncourt & all the other truly remarkable talents.<br /> Every recorder player, every baroque enthusiast must have this recordings, in case you can not afford please email me I'll gladly share with the files.<br /><br />MDOD1581728@gmail.com
0920668364|1.0|This book was weird!  I felt pretty uncomfortable reading it to my daughter.  If my mother in law drove in her car to rock my husband at night I would freak out.  I felt this book showed an unhealthy relationship between mother and child.  I want my little one to know I support them growing up and value each stage of their development.
B000HKYN74|5.0|I started watching Star Trek: Enterprise on a network television web site, however many of the episodes were completely missing or wouldn't play for one reason or another. I'm glad I was able to watch the entire series on Instant Video, as the episodes were complete, played all the way through from start to finish in one try, and there were no commercials to interrupt the storylines or potentially disrupt playback.<br />Season three is a very well written storyline that I could easily have watched from beginning to end in one sitting, had time permitted.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The author comes off a bit arrogant, sometimes hard to like. In any case, I found myself believing his story. I found renewed faith in the insignificant of this life in contrast to eternity. It's the message, not the messenger.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Amazingly easy to use and lightweight. A must have app since it tells you how long it takes takes to charge to full - great for optimizing battery life.
B00940XIGU|4.0|This whole thing keeps me awake and all I wanna do is dance. What the F*** has the sickest beat I've heard in a while and I love the song Sweat that is funny and nice to dance too.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It pretty much followed the book (other than Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher) but left significant parts out that made the book an outstanding read.
B00CS7Z1W0|5.0|The group has come out with something that was totally worth the long wait. The songs are wonderful and inspiring. Jared has the best voice out there right now of any male lead singer. I listen to this everyday and I really can't wait to hear what more they have in the future.
0374275637|5.0|The experience of reading this book is painful. However memory of reading this book is enjoyable. Very well written book
B00BBW16HW|5.0|A comfortable uplifting movie.  Great  acting great story good story telling.  Even though you know there is much more depth and not so neat, easy and clean as shown it was a nice slice of their lives.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better.  Such a good mix of thrilling yet plausible events, smart characters with smart dialogue, and the broad range of human emotions.  It's a family dynamic with a twist, and Joshua Jackson pulls it all together so well. Loved Season 3's story arcs in particular.
B0094M2ODQ|4.0|Good romantic story. The bad language is totally unnecessary. Had they left that out it would have been a really good movie.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I bought this particular glass cutter because it is eco-friendly. I put my projects on hold for and didn't use it right away. When I got around to use it, the plastic tip that goes into the bottle was cracked. I tried using duct tape to fix it but that didn't work. I contacted the company explaining (past 30 days) and tried to at least get a replacement part. The email reply I received stated they don't sell replacement parts, I should just use the duct tape. Seriously, worst customer service email ever. I ended up getting the Kinkajou Bottle Cutter and I love it.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Loved him since his Hootie days, but found him again with &#34;Wagon wheel&#34; and then &#34;Shine&#34; ... great songs, great album!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was an intriguing game. Going to get the next one. I hope it is as good as this game
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic. This was sort of a One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in the 2000's. Robert DeNiro was outstanding also. Sort of a feel good movie where you are routing for the main characters even though they are flawed.
B00377E5SG|5.0|Sabrina (the 1954 version) was always my favorite movie. Hepburn and Bogart were perfect and wonderful together. I never thought I would like the newer version as much, but Ford and Ormond were spectacular! Ormond made me feel exactly what Hepburn did, and Ford allowed his character, Linus, to have more depth. It was wonderful!
B000002L3P|5.0|The first time I heard one of the songs off this I was in a public place.  I thought this is terrific.  I need to find out who that is and get it.<br />I recently replaced it.  I had it on casette.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Edgy, idiosyncratic, amusing.<br />Seeing the teenage world through the eyes of this strange but sympathic<br />person does indeed give a new perspective.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|They where better than I thought they would be and i'm very happy with the mic! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnTDU4zBupA This is my unboxing of the mic!
B00A25NLOU|4.0|The book bubbles with new ideas and perspectives.<br />The story is unpredictable, moves along quickly and is<br />rounded off nicely at  the end.
B0050OMJIW|5.0|It's usually I like the book from the beginning or I hate the author's style, but not in the case of Catch 22. It's all started with brief description of characters during World War 2, from American perspective. And till the end you can't stop reading the book with all the &#34;life true&#34; situation, black humor, cynic and question of moral.<br /><br />Book has a lot of places of government critique such as:<br /><br />&#34;he was jeopardizing his traditional rights of freedom and independence by daring to exercise them&#34;<br />&#34;it was neither possible not necessary to educate people who never questioned anything&#34;<br /><br />but also universal applied rules:<br />&#34;like Olympic medals and tennis trophies, all they signified was that the owner had done something of no benefit to anyone more capably than everyone else&#34;<br />&#34;some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them&#34;<br /><br />in the overall the book caused the paradox situation name of the catch 22.<br />sometimes in life it's just about catch 22...<br /><br />highly recommend the book to read for all intellectuals.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Always keeps you on your toes, interesting, intrigueing, couldn't stop watching to the very last episode, already for the next season
B008L1DNGI|4.0|The game is fun for a time killer. Difficulty is all over the place with some being solved in seconds and others being real tough. It's a bit repetitive, but for a free download phone game I certainly can't complain too much.
B008Y73940|3.0|I have read the book and now seen the movie.  I like Matthew McConaughey. As usual, the movie makes changes to the book and not for the better. 1) changed ending, 2) failed to explain some important parts.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This was something that was for older children that could read. It was all captioned so nothing my 3 years old grandson could do.
0307352153|5.0|After a lifetime of being made to believe that introversion was inferior to extroversion, I feel vindicated and validated! This thoroughly researched and well written book provides insight into the value of being an introvert in a society that lauds and worships extroverts. The author writes that introverts are \\" highly sensitive, keen observers, philosophical, spiritual, creative, intuitive, feel exceptionally strong emotions, dream vividly, are highly empathic and notice subtleties.\\"<br /><br />Extroverts may do all the talking and chest-thumping, but we introverts are nearby, designing technologies that change the world, writing words that document the human experience, and running the businesses that fuel progress. And we're content to do it all in the background, in a humble, sensitive and conscientious manner.<br /><br />Whether you place yourself in the introvert or extrovert column, you should read this book for the insights into the way the two types can work together and co-exist, because the fact is that we need both types for the world to work and neither is inferior to the other.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Excellent storyline. Talented author. Kept me intrigued until the end. I have recommended it to everyone. I will read the authors other works, for sure.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Finally charged up my kindle again last night. I was on page 100 at 2am and finally had to put it down from exhaustion at 5am. Amazing book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thought this was an amazing story! There was definitely enough excitement to keep you on your toes. The first two were definitely the best of the three. With the third book, forwards the end, I felt the author almost gave up or got bored with writing the story. But it still kept me going. I would definitely recommend this to someone who needed a good book.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Love the beginning, love the idea, love the story, dissapointing ending since I was rooting for you know whom already if you watched the film :(.<br />But almost the whole movie is so good to be true.<br />A lot of surprises as the film goes on.<br />Gerard Butler looks so determined and serious in this film, fantastic.<br />Jamie Fox is nice as well.<br />Good movie :).<br />Go watch it on DVD, so entertaining and satisfying you will be at the end :D.
0345505387|1.0|I am a major fan of the Outlander and the Lord John Series.  I own all of them in kindle and paper.  This book was a major dissapointment.  The rework of the excellent Outlander is not real good and the artistic interpretation of the characters that I have come to love look more Asian or something out of \\"Middle Earth\\".  A total waste of time to read it and a waste of money to buy it.  I hope the author does not continue to spoil her reputation with more of this stuff. I wish I could have rated the book with \\"0\\" stars but I had to give it one because of the way the system is set up.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The story is good for the younger audience. It has many silly moments and predictable. Still gives you moments to think about.
B003UESJDI|4.0|Funny and touching movie. Shows a young woman dealing with major changes in her life in a humorous way including the bad choices our youth can make. Love the insight into the aging married couple and the using and enabling that too often goes on.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Kinda reminded me of my warm, loving, funny family  Should have received more academy awards as the acting was simply fantastic.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Those surfers are nuts but amazing. You could tell it was a documentary not a movie but stil excellent. I loved it but would not pay to see in a theater
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|As anyone who grew up loving this album (and maybe even seeing a laser light show set to it) knows, this is an awesome album.  I, like many, no longer have my album on vinyl, and haven't listened to it in its entirety in quite a few years.  While I've heard songs here and there on the radio, there is something to be said for the way it leaves you feeling after you hear all 40+ hypnotic minutes straight through.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|It was amazing. to think that ity was a true story. Sometimes it was difficult to understand but over all it was excellent
B003097ABA|5.0|Why would you get the &#34;Best of...&#34; when you can have a boxed set?  This is a fantastic package that lets you own all the hits without the loss of some of the &#34;b-side&#34; songs you loved...  It's all here.  Playing them takes me back to high school.  I set up a playlist on my iTunes and these albums, along with a few other late 70s, early 80s tunes are all there.  Now this was music!
B003DFJW9E|5.0|I really love Hans Zimmer, and I needed this soundtrack to do a project on him for a class. I am glad that I could buy it digitally on Amazon because it was much cheaper than iTunes.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|Kairosoft only releases certain types of games. Once you've played one, chances are you've played at least 20-30% of most everything else they've made. Still, this game is as meta as you can get. You play the CEO of an upstart game design company and you design games as part of the gameplay. I repeat, you play a game where you make games that others play. The novelty factor alone in this game is worth the two or three bucks you'll spend to get it.<br /><br />It is, unfortunately, fairly short and very linear. You're able to restart the game after the main campaign is over and retain your research bonuses and quality points, but that's it. The music doesn't change, the same characters take the same crazy amount of time to strengthen and you'll still find yourself firing the same lackluster employees. I'd liken this game to a very scenic and entertaining four-to-five hour drive. It's the same forwards and backwards, but it's one heck of a fun way to kill the better part of a day.<br /><br />Buy this game, but don't expect to have your life changed over it. It's not art, it's one of the best time wasters you can buy for under five dollars.
B0000640VO|5.0|A recommendation by my French tutor, looks very interesting and great not sad like most French Movies but will see it shortly, great seller though
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Jurassic Park fans will get a kick out of the notion that almost the entire original crew has returned(in the same clothes they wore in the first movie) to build another Jurassic Park. The game is essentially no different from anything you'd play on Facebook. It's a game where the only real way to progress with any kind of interesting speed is to get friends involved or spend money. The tasks are repetitive and the game feels as soulful as an office park without any trees. Your kids might like it, you might even like it, but I don't.<br /><br />However, the art and caricatures are very well done. The art for this game is pretty darn good.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to see the movie but the viewer ratings intrigued me.  What a surprise, the movie and storyline were outstanding!  The theme is haunting though.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I was addicted to the browser version of this game when it was posted on Newgrounds. When I saw the changes made to the game and the new game types, I snapped it up right away. The learning curve on the game is a little steep, but once you get the notion of stealth and infectiousness over creating a death-toll in the early stages of the game, it's smooth sailing for the first few &#34;infections.&#34; After that, you have to tailor your strategy to what medium through which you'll be eradicating the human race.<br /><br />The art is impressive and the in-game news can often be chuckle-worthy. The games themselves last from 15 minutes to over half an hour, depending on your play speed and how comfortable you are with the game. It's cheap, it's fun and it's worth your time. Pick this one up.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Hoosers and The Natural are often seen as two of the very best in the sports movie genre. The Blind Side is really much more than just a sports movie, but as such it ranks right up there among the best sports flicks. It is an excellent cultural wakeup call movie as well. I taught school for more than 30 years and I've seen the system save kids and I've seen kids fall thru the cracks as well. This movie tells a good story of how showing someone some kindness and support can be all that a person needs to reach their goals.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Modern update on how to save an historic manor further revealing modern changes in English class issues. More family tragedy.
B003TTCURU|5.0|Love the characters and their drama! Each character's story line will keep you wanting to know what will happen next.
B0010T75W6|5.0|Sad story of a sex change operation simply to get across the Berlin wall rather than any real desire for a sex change.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Tom Cruise always brings it for the Mission Impossible features. I love him in these, and this one was awesome. Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner were a good addition. Thoroughly enjoyed it and the picture and sound quality were perfect.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|history of an English manor revealing a lot about social class and it's change over time, and very interesting view of the impact of World War I on society.
0142419400|4.0|Plot: The plot for Anna and the French Kiss sounds like any other contemporary book and it is, but what saves it from being just any other ya romance is the writing. Stephanie is a very talented writer and she has made the perfect spring/summer book. At first I didn't really like the plot but around page 50 I was sold! I loved the romance between Anna and St. Clair and the location was a great addition to the plot and it added a lot to the story.<br /><br />Characters: I loved all the main characters. Anna and St. Clair were my favorites, but their friends in Paris were great as well. Paris feels almost like a secondary character as well and not so much as a location and I loved how well Stephanie Perkins pulled this off.<br /><br />Overall: Loved the film references in the book and the writing were lovely. The pacing of the book is some of the best pacing I've seen in a book. The only thing that seemed to bother me was how quickly the storyline wrapped up at the end of the book, but I still enjoyed the ending very much. If you love YA contemporary  then you will more than likely fall in love with Anna and the French Kiss. Am looking forward to the other two companion novels! 4.5/5 Stars
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I have really come to love this show, and I'm not in the typical demographic.  Oliver queen is a believable character- he comes very flawed, but knows he can still make a difference. The ensemble cast is amazing.  A must watch!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Some features available through web interface only such as creating folders or organizing favorites.  I added a station using this Android app:  it plays using iPhone app but not Android app even though I added the station with the Android app!  I added another station and  deleted it from my favorites but it keeps reappearing in my favorites.  I have contacted support but they are either slow to respond or will not respond.  Very BUGGY app!!!!!!
B00BHXUC8E|5.0|why are you reading my review?  Stop wasting time - it's whitesnake, if you like them - buy it.  it's worth it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book shows the loss of love life and happiness but picks it back up in the end. how many lives lost . But  in the end everyone gets what what they want. Over all this book is amazing, deadly, and lovely...just like the girl on FIRE
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|Well constructed, thoughtfully written, great acting - it's a crime they cancelled this show so quickly - but at least the showrunners wrapped it up in a satisfying way.  Great show.  I watched it on amazon prime and will be buying it just to own it.  great great show.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Great documentary and the cap center concert from 77 brings back some great memories! Can't wait to see them live again.
B007THA4FI|1.0|A waste of money.  Hate to admit I paid $18.99 for this book on my Kindle.  I wanted to like this book because Rowling wrote it and I loved Harry Potter, but can't say that.  Could not get past the 1st 15 pages, so much explicit details on things that don't really need to be in detail.  I think that she tried to be like Fifty Shades of Gray, but in a political sense.  Failure on all counts.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I was stoked to finally get my DVDs in the mail and I was not disappointed! There are not enough words to describe my love for the television series AND the books. Thanks George Martin for the books, I started reading again and to the creators of the show. good good stuff!<br /><br />My one complaint is that my dvd version came a little scratched but I'm sure that was the person who packaged it and not the fault of Amazon.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was initially afraid to read this book when I heard of the story line, but I fell in love with it from the very first page.  Well written.  Just saw the movie recently and am anxiously waiting for November for Catching Fire!
B0081L391C|4.0|I just love this movie it's so funny n entertaining I highly recommend it! I hope they do a sequel cuz I would like to see these characters grow n expand!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this book.  Still need to see the movie, but the characters are well-written and a very fast read.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Good performances but a tad lack luster, Russell Crowe is quite enigmatic at points and Mark Wahlberg is just georgeous!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read a lot of negative reviews about this book, a lot of which give away key points in the book. You should not base whether to buy this book or not on the negative reviews; you should read it and form an opinion of your own.<br />I enjoyed the book and thought the ending was perfect, sure, not what some readers wanted, but I was happy that Sookie was happy.<br />It is difficult for any author to end a series HEA the way every single person wants the series to end.
B001JU4S44|4.0|Reasonable plot and Thandi Newton's standout performance made me give this movie 4 stars and of course the insults that were routinely hurled at Tom Cruise's character, especially at the end, by the villain, certainly made it all the more enjoyable.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I recommend this book for people who like intrigue, suspense , and action in a book. A story with lots of surprises !
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|heard this song on the radio it immediately got my attention so i decided to purchase.<br />this is now my ringtone.
0345803493|5.0|Yes its true the first book is a little bit of a drag....but this one will have you laughing, tearing up and jaw dropping love it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I resisted buying this CD for a while, but once I gave in, I am completely addicted. Totally devoted to T-Swizz!
0345803485|4.0|It kept me interested enough. I was a little upset with how he treats her at times. But work your way through this book and I promise book 2 and 3 are totally worth it!!!
B0011E9LBI|4.0|Fun alien movie. No human blood and guts, but a lot of alien blood and guts. Fairly violent, but not offensively so. Recommended for kids over 7.
0345803507|5.0|Yes the first book could have used some work on writing the story but totally worth reading to get to this one !!
B008Y73940|5.0|acting was great, good story line, a nice change from other action movies, Matthew McConaughey is awesome.  Would watch again.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|For me, the true test of how good a book is has to do with how quickly I read portions of it. In this case I tore through the first two-thirds (because it was terrific and gripping) and drew to a snail's pace for the final third (as I simply did not want it to end). For me this is the highest praise.<br /><br />From the outset the characters grab you and McCann's writing pulls you in and forces you to care about them - you may not like them but you root for them nonetheless.  His writing is extremely poetic and invokes more imagery - both internal and external - than almost any other author I've read. To take a famous public event and then wrap multiple stories around it is artistic genius.<br /><br />Also, it was appropriate that Dave Eggers had written one of the reviews contained in the book, because this is along the same lines as one of his novels.
B00139XTG4|5.0|With the continued increase of our dependence on and incorporation of technology, our world is moving more into a place in which the highly improbable will have a greater impact on our daily lives.  Due to complexity, there is no way to predict a \\"Black Swan\\" event, but there are ways to make sure you can capitalize on positive \\"Black Swan\\" events and ways to mitigate the negative ones. This is the center message from Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book The Black Swan.<br /><br />The book does read like a philosophy book: a great deal of deep analysis with lots of quotes (even though he complains about philosophers who quote too much).  Sprinkled between the deep analysis is an elitist fervor, especially about economists and their \\"bell curves\\".<br /><br />If you can get past his elitism and sarcasm, this book and its message are truly ingenious.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put it down!  A worthy continuance of the 1st book in the trilogy. My son is going to love this book and I can't wait to get started on the final book.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is so incredible! Set aside some time and have a Sherlock marathon one weekend. You won't regret it!
B00723NWJE|4.0|I personally didnt listen to it but it was a request so it had to of been good to those who like  her and her music
B0081336FO|5.0|I just love this show so much! I spent one weekend a few weeks ago watching seasons 1 and 2, and I've already watched both seasons again. I just can't get enough. Looking forward to season 3!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|This is a feast of non stop fun. Its a well crafted film as it never stops for a moment from fast. Lots of action, twists and cool dialogue. Its hard to fault as its original, entertaining and exciting. The two main characters stay cool, have attitude and take the show to places few have gone before.
B002RVCD6O|1.0|It misses the book by a mile. Which would be fine if the movie itself was any good. Acting, writing, and directing were all terrible.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I enjoyed the story and concept of, what if, if time travel were possible. 11/22/63 was good but not brilliant.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It's good. If u like love stories then u will love this. The ending was awesome! Didn't expect it at all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy Downton Abbey because it's clean. The show is also historically interesting, and the setting, music and costumes are beautiful.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|it is slow and not well explained once you catch on and keep your wallet closed you will find yourself coming back again to play the limit comes quickly.  Spend and you can play as long as you like
B005XLN97M|5.0|Got this for my niece and she loves it.  The best part is the price these Barbie houses are very expensive , but this was a good price.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|I have been trying to download this app for a few hours still have not been able to get it to download on my android phone Very sad because I have the free version and I recommend it to my therapist so he may recommend it to others any chance I can get some help
B000NY12CI|2.0|Ayaan continually misinterpreted the Koran; i.e., (Allah) God approves the beating of your wife...not true.  She generalizes the African customs, i.e., excision, being practiced across the Muslim world...not true.  It's true that a Muslim man can have more than one bride (due to wars, many husbands were killed and men could take more than one wife to care for the women and her children), but only if he  could care for them equally.  She claims Allah is not a caring, loving God...she is wrong.  We don't fear Allah; we can fear judgment day when we will face him and must account for all of our sins.<br /><br />These are just a few of the inaccuracies that really bothered me.  I would hate for the average person to read this book, because their views of the Muslim world and Allah would be wrong.  The terrorists groups do the same thing,  misquoting the Koran to suit their needs.<br /><br />Ayaan was raised in Africa by African Muslims who interpreted the Koran based on their own upbringing and customs.  Based on her upbringing, I probably would also be an Infidel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the way to get the night shift in the night before you can say yes I have to build it takes me back till tomorrow bye
B00633W614|5.0|Loved this family saga.  Hooked me right away.  Characters well developed and story well told. Archer fans take note! A must read
1400034205|5.0|Who knew that this novel by W. Somerset Maugham published in 1944 would be like finding The Holy Grail of American Literature in 2013?  As an English Lit major in the late 60's, I read most, if not all, of the classics--but not one of my classes at UCI had Maugham on the list of required reading.  This terrible gap in my knowledge has now been gladly filled, thanks to my friend Mary who suggested it for our first Book Club meeting.<br />The Razor's Edge has a plot which anyone can google and easily digest--but it is the writing that cannot be put in a tidy nutshell--every turn of phrase, every descriptive detail is so finely honed, the characters seem to pop to life off the page. It is a book that makes you want to read everything this man ever wrote (now on my bucket list).  BTW, just viewed a movie based on another Maugham novel entitled The Painted Veil starring Edward Norton and Naomi Watts.  A must-see for die-hard romantics.

B000O5ZPF6|5.0|Anyone who loves the musical stylings of Jean-Michele Jarre will love this particular album. The song keeps flowing in an unbroken stream from edge to middle on the vinyl, with the only break being between one side to the other. Very much recommended!
B00CDCIQX6|1.0|you can't watch this if you have a mac.  this is BS.  WHY can't they stream reasonably to a mac?  OR download? ridiculous.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|For whatever reason, I had never really read any John le Carre.  Over the weekend, I read an excerpt of A Delicate Truth in Harpers and immediately downloaded the whole book.  A Delicate Truth is, usually, fast paced and entertaining as le Carre continues his decades long meditation on the need for truth in politics and how secrecy leads to unintended consequences and blow back.<br /><br />John le Carre is the polar opposite of Ian Fleming whose secret agent Bond's debonair exploits were always successful and appreciated by the wise masters at MI5.  Le Carre's agent, Tobe, is conflicted and uncertain and his masters are incompetent prisoners of an essentially corrupt military industrial complex which uses secrecy as an excuse to hide its mistakes.<br /><br />Despite le Carre's clear political views, the book does not preach and is very entertaining.  The characters are clear.  The story is entertaining; and the suspense level is high.  I can't wait to see the movie.  Until then, and probably even after, the book stands on its own and is much better than the typical thriller.  I highly recommend it.
B000HZCZZ6|5.0|Classic Star Trek pushing the envelope forward.<br /><br />FX in the film are well done.  The story line is of sufficient depth & twist.  It's not as 'attention grabbing' film Generations is, but it won't let you fall asleep or get bored either.  Directing is well done as are the characters, who the cast know intimately at this point.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I won't go into a song-by-song review of the album -- I'll let the music critics do that.  I'll just say that if you enjoy other music by Jack White (White Stripes, Racconteurs), you'll definitely enjoy Blunderbuss.  &#34;Love Interruption&#34; and &#34;Sixteen Saltines&#34; are my favorite tunes, but I enjoy listening to the entire album.
B000HZD168|5.0|Given Star Trek, which came back to us in 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' was more about gloss than story, *this* is the engaging, attention demanding film you expect from Star Trek.  This is Kirk & Kahn in their private, but all so public, conflict.  The subtleties of their conflict from TOS come to a head WITH A BANG!  A few 'less than spectacular' pauses, but great film none-the-less
B006M4F67A|2.0|Per the Kindle newsletter there was a zoom option, not found. No options to increase size or options to do anything. Tiles too faded.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The season just keeps getting better! Now that the second season is over The third season is on my watchlist.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|This was a wonderful story of dedication, drive, and love.  Recommend to others.  Faith is portrayed in this movie.  Share
B0064MGU98|5.0|Watched and was hooked.  Great series! Have recommended to friends. Look forward to watching season 2 on Amazon Prime can't wait.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|As a Star Wars fan I had to get this as soon as I could. It's Angry Birds with a Star Wars theme what else could I say, except its great. Maybe they could make it not sap your very fragile battery though.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|We'll I bought this CD on release day, yesterday, at Best Buy for $9.99.  I may not have bought it so timely but I did see Alice in Chains at the Rave in Milwaukee Wisconsin two weeks ago today (5-15-13).  Their amazing set and performances of some new songs such as \\"Phantom Limb\\" and \\"Stone\\" get me in the mood for a new CD.  I'd have to say I like it alot.  Parts of me think that maybe it's too old school AIC, but then again isn't that what we want?  Us 30 year olds complain when an old band we like comes back but the songs are weak.  I feel like it really does sound like old Alice in Chains.  If you don't like it maybe you don't like it for what it is today, but this is how they sounded in my opinion.  Slow chunky guitars, somber vocal melodies..  I like it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have been playing this game for over a year on my cell phone and just recently added it<br />to my Kindle games. One thing I have noticed about the Kindle version that is different an that I don't like<br />however is that there are no special words offered for extra points if you want to use one of your bombs.<br />This might be a function of an upgrade though but on my phone I don't recall ever having to upgrade to<br />get that feature. I do enjoy the bigger screen and having a more spatial palate to play on.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Fantastic reboot without killing off old series timeline.  Perfect casting.  The sequel was even better.  3D IMAX was made for this movie.
B00B5P37IG|2.0|There are mainly TV shows that I never watch.  Also, if you need a foreign language station, there are numerous ones.
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|I like it. It helped me to manage my application ion EC2 and cloudsearch. I really recommended to everyone. l
B00C061HZY|5.0|Make no mistake, Random Access Memories is a great album. If you're looking for a remake of &#34;Homework&#34; or a more &#34;dancy&#34; title, you may be left wanting something. For those who love the funk, this album is killer.<br /><br />I really dig &#34;Instant Crush&#34; featuring the lead singer from the Strokes.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I always loved these type of games but they became hard to find. Happy they are coming back. The Room was challenging and made you use your brain!  Loved it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I will admit I would be more inclined to pay for a longer game, but then again this game may some time to solve. The game itself, the design, the interface, the storyline and the context are all beautifully well designed.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|... For the Harry potter fan. Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She never mentioned anything wrong with the DVDs so I am assuming this deal worked well for her. Fast shipping. Nicely put together. Nice addition to any DVD collector.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|cool game.  kind of basic but plays well and is fun.  only complaint is cost of cheats and upgrades<br /> would be nice to have more upgrades in game :-)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I've enjoyed reading the series.  Good writine and plot has alot of twist and turns to keep me interested and engaged with the characters.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great basic alligator game and the ads at the beginning of play are not excessive. The settings allow different scoring an play as well as customizing the look of the game.
B001NLL93W|5.0|story continues with the same characters.  Enjoy the authors writing style and look forward to the next book.  Haven't finished book but so far it's got me hooked.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|This is a great app for me,  since I don't use fractions often. I try to avoid if possible. This is very helpful when I am trying to explain fractions to my son.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I bought this book when it was a self published ebook. To say it was pretty good for a self published ebook is a bit of an understatement, in the sense that \\"the ocean is wet\\" and \\"the sun is bright\\", are understatements.<br /><br />This book is the best fantasy novel that I have read this year. If I had copies of the new \\"Name of the Wind\\" and book 6 of \\"Song of Ice and fire\\" sitting in front of me, and the second book in this series as well... I would not know which one to start first.<br /><br />I have read it about 3 times now. It is just as good as I remember.<br /><br />The 5 star reviews are honest and heartfelt. Amazon needs to do something to differentiate between a book that has 300 5 star reviews from people who think the book is great, and an Author who is giving free copies of the sequel for a good review. Because I passed over this book twice because it looked like the reviews were padded.<br /><br />I read a great many ebooks, many self published. I am okay reading a not so great one every now and again, but this was a stunning revelation.<br /><br />If Mr. Ryan keeps writing like this, he will one day be an example of an author passed over by publishers who went the self publishing route and proved them wrong. Really effing wrong. Whomever read this at a publishing house and passed on it needs to go into a new line of work.<br /><br />Penguin has picked it up, and because of this we will have a year wait for Mr. Ryan to do book tours and conventions and otherwise milk this book for the profit it deserves. Sadly this makes me bitter, if Penguin had not picked it up I could be reading book 2 now. Write book 3 Mr Ryan, before the convention circuit destroys your work ethic.<br /><br />But YOU are reading a review, like you haven't read this book yet. Stop reading reviews, buy this book and start reading. You may lose some sleep.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I have watched this movie several times since it's first release, and each time watching it is like the first time...simply awesome concept of the real world verses the fake, ordinary daily life that most live.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The app works as described. I like how it gives you a list of how much energy has been used by each app. The app also gives you an estimate of how long it will take to fully charge the battery, which the kindle only gives you charging %. it does omit its own energy used however, and since it does use energy it will drain your battery some. Overall helpful and easy to use.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is very good. It is very fun to play. When you play I hope you have fun. It is so fun to play. Thank You so much.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|Good plot, good acting.  Dennis Quaid delivers his usual good performance and the story is edge of your chair action.
B008Y6OJGI|1.0|The audio quality of this movie is terrible. I will request a refund when I figure out how to do that for a digital purchase.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Great comic book like fun, my kids love it and it's ok for them to watch-- nothing truly offensive, just entertainment.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|Good app but has a lot a crash problems I'm sure if I had a iPad 4 and not a kindle it would work a lot better but still a great app only thing missing is cues 3 would be nice.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I originally had this set in DVD format with the Voight-Kampf collector case.  It's one of my all-time favorite Sci-Fi films, and now I have it in Blu-Ray! and even at a great price!  It's nice to have all the versions in Blu-Ray format including the Workprint.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Loving every aspect of this app, the interface is straightforward and the sounds are amazing. Mixing your own sleep sounds is the best feature by far. Endless possibilities.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I just received this magnificent set and was brought to tears by the sheer majesty of the 5.1 The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.  The brilliance was overwhelming and reminded me just what a monster band Genesis was in the beginning...and then I watched the bonus interviews.  What a sad, bitter disillusioned crew the Other members (sans Gabriel)appear to be.  Clearly jealous and envious of Gabriel, Tony Banks comes across like a little school boy whose thunder has been stolen by a rival. He criticizes Lamb because Gabriel \\"wrote all the lyrics\\" and then will throw out the occasional snide \\"compliment\\" (e.g. \\"Pete's little song.\\") Tony what great lyrics came after Pete left the band (susudio)? Gabriel was their Lennon and they basically forced him out because they were bitter about him becoming the star.  Make no mistake they sold out big time after he left despite Collins' pleadings that this is the same band that went on to make other music.  No, Phil it is not.  Genesis ceased to exist when Gabriel left.  Wings are not Beatles.  A group without Gabriel is not Genesis.  Enjoy this box set and buy it immediately. It is the only Genesis you will ever hear. All the other songs (after Pete) filed under the name \\"Genesis\\" are, in the end, only silly love songs.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|If you are looking for an app to interface with Google+ on Kindle Fire, this is not it. Only downloads pictures sporadically.  It might be because Google changed the format recently, but it just doesn't work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so boss I advise you to get the game. Plus it is free this game is so fun that even my dog goes crazy over it I say subway surfers and he runs all around the house. Hahahahahahahahaha that's funny!!!!
B000OSDSKM|4.0|Only Elmer Gentry beats the performance hear. This reminds me of  Alexander Haige and Dick Chenney must have watched this numerous times to fashion their subversive moves to obtain power and influence. All for their gain. I just wish we had a Kirk Douglas minding the store at the time.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|I loved this show when it first aired back in the days, but it's even better now.  Then again, what else would you expect from David Lynch?  I recommend this series to anyone who had not yet seen it, and highly recommend it if you've seen it years ago... there's so many nuances and clues there that I didn't catch before.  Excellent!
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I know some might say &#34;So what?&#34;, *anyone* can do a retro sort of album.  But, not personally being extremely deep into previous Daft Punk material, I went into this very open-minded as I do anything unfamiliar and has piqued my interest.  I'd say that given the fact this duo has every reason to ride their own wave of previous successes and not be too adventurous, doing a Robots In Love concept  album that includes someone as near-obscure as 70's songwriter Paul Williams, or disco producer Giorgio Moroder and keeping a straight face about it deserves some sincere artistic kudos.  As far as listening, it is a mix of fun, weirdness, thought provoking and simply entertaining.  And for anyone who is familiar with the actual music or the era / genre, there is certainly an authentic aesthetic throughout.  I see other reviews that indicate this is a polarizing release for some Daft Punk fans.  But from my very limited research into the band, I'd say their key attribute is a constant reinvention process, so I'm surprised anyone is surprised :)  Recommended.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|This type of movie has been done over and over. The hokiest scene was where cruise throws down arms to fight hand to hand. Yeah, like that would ever happen in real life.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I'va always enjoyed all of Jeffrey Archer's books, and this final in the Chronicles was no exception. The ending however, really left me hanging and hoping that there will be a final/final, to get me off the hook.
B005NFWCSK|2.0|They could have moved this along at a slightly pace and vastly improved the quality of the movie. It had a great story line, but too much time was spent looking at kevin bacon's unchanging s*** eating evil grin and others unchanging expressions.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great drama, great stories, and great acting.  Disappointing the 4th season isn't prime but love that Amazon has 1-3 on instant view.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Everything jj touches seems to turn to gold. Ive seen this several times and liked every character except for spock. He seems so vastly immature that anyone could get him going. Thats not exactly how the character ever acted before and nothing happened to change that.
0307352145|1.0|This book is the beginning of my protest about authors who provide no indication in the text that there is end note information. I refuse to read a book that has notes but no indication of that in the text. If I see an indication of a note, I can decide to read it or not. If there is no indication, I have a choice to skip all notes or go back after I finish the book and re-read pages to see if the note information is important to me.<br /><br />I spent the afternoon looking for a style manual that had information about this kind of citation and found none. Every article I found through Google talked about the number or some indication in the text and then talked of the format of the footnote or endnote.<br /><br />A scholarly book should make viewing citations or additional material easy to find.<br /><br />I would request a refund for this book but I've had it for some time and just started reading. Without my finishing it, it's going into the stack to take to sell at my local book store.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|What a novel and original concept for s film... although some of the individual story lines seemed derivative of other movies like one flew over the cuckoos nest, the china syndrome, bladerunner, the matrix, and mad max. Still it was excellent as long as you can understand the future dialects spoken by the characters.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Although I'm a casual fan of the Star Trek series, I highly recommend this film.  It is a combination of excitement, thrill, fun, and a little sadness (don't want to spoil it).  Many people assume that you have to be a hardcore Star Trek fan in order to love this film.  I'm here to tell you that's absolutely false.  It's an easy film to watch with friends and families.  J.J. Abrams does a great job interpreting this film.  I thought the first film was great, but I loved \\"Into Darkness\\" even more.  I was a little skeptical at first when I found out that Cumberbatch was the villain.  Don't get me wrong, I love Cumberbatch as an actor (Sherlock Holmes), but I've only known him as a protagonist.  Boy was I wrong, he did a great job making his character (John Harrison/ Khan) believable.  He wasn't the typical cheesy villain some of us are accustomed to.  Pine and Quinto did a great job reprising their roles and their character development together.  All in all it's a fun film that will not disappoint.  Must-see film!
B00CW665VI|4.0|*I received an ARC in exchange for my honest review.*<br /><br />Just when I needed a good book to lift me from my heavy reading funk along came Tangled. This book was laugh out loud funny. My favourite part about it was probably that it was from Drew's point of view. Books that are purely focused on just male POV are so rare but the fact this one was funny as well? Pure comedic genius.<br /><br />I loved Drew from the start. Sure if you were a feminist you may have taken offence straight away (the man does not mince his words)<br /><br /> \\"For those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel, or any other generic endearment? Don't make the mistake of thinking he's so into you, he's already thinking up pet names. It's because he can't or doesn't care to remember your actual name\\"<br /><br />But his style is very much tongue in cheek and he tells it like it is. This was not only hilarious but refreshing to me. I loved the beginning of the story, Drew was moping around like he had the worst case of man flu. Turns out that wasn't the case, it was something much worse for a man like him; he had fallen in love!<br /><br />Enter Katherine 'Kate' Brooks, the woman who turned Drew's world upside down. I loved Kate because I live for strong female characters and I loved when she put Drew in his place. For a serial playboy, Drew needed the challenge, he was used to women falling at his feet so the minute Kate turned him down she held his attention.<br /><br />I loved the banter back and forth between Drew and Kate, asides from Drew's inner monologue  their interactions were some of the funniest parts of the story. But then again I loved the tender moments between him and Kate also. It was just a great read.<br /><br />There were also some great supporting characters, especially Alexandra, Drew's sister. I loved her strong will and 'fix it attitude'. But it has to be said Drew's niece MacKenzie quite easily stole the show. There were so many freakishly cute moments with her and Drew.<br /><br />Emma Chase is a great author, I loved the way she captured Drew's mind and detailed it all for us to see. He was sexy, charming and endearing;  that man could sell ice to Eskimos. The pacing of the story was great and I loved that Drew had met his match in Kate. He needed a strong female to balance out his character. This book will have you smiling and laughing like crazy as you read so take note if you decide to read in public ( I learned this the hard way ;))<br /><br />I highly recommend Tangled to book lovers of romance, humour and great writing. ~Ava<br /><br />My favourite quotes: \\"It makes me want to kiss her and strangle her at the same time. I've never been into S&M. But I'm beginning to see its benefits.\\"<br /><br />\\"It finally happened.\\" \\"What happened?\\" \\"What you've been wishing on me all these years,\\" I whisper. \\"I fell in love.\\"ece MacKenzie quite easily stole the show.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is very entertaining, but it can become very expensive.  When people entertain themselves, they do not want it be so expensive that they have to stop doing it.  The prices are not big enough and there should be other types of bingo games like the letter X or a double bingo.  The games should be commensurate with the difficulty of the bingo game.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|What a great movie.  The acting is wonderful and the personal stories compelling.  I'd recommend this to anyone who has encountered mental illness and/or romance at any time in their lives, which is most of us, and who can tolerate witnessing a loving but neurotic family.

B000UX6THK|2.0|This is the most dumbed down show I have even brought myself to watch. Paying about $40 for the set though, I figured we at least should watch it. Each segment gets just a little dumber than the last one. OVER ACTING, NO ACTING, screaming...Some of the scenery is awesome but as for the story line it sucks.
0385742886|5.0|The book the kill order by James dashner that I ordered is amazing!  Definitely five stars! The book looks brand new like it was bought in the store! I can't wait to read it! Not only could I not find this book at any local walmarts, I capfuls by find it at books a million, target, Hastings, and many more book carriers. Amazon was the only place I could find it. Plus it was cheeeeeap! This was a good buy!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Just another average invincible military trained super trooper vs bad guys with an elaborate but easily predictable scheme. Doesn't Hollywood know by now that it is the average man put in extraordinary circumstances that create memorable hero's?
0345803507|5.0|I have read many Negative reviews about this book... I understand that is badly written, but when you get past that the Story is really good, is like Cinderella for adults. I love a good LoveStory and I think that even though we hate Christian as a Control, Possessive freak we all deep down which we were Anastasia. (I know I do). So I just don´t understand if you hated the book so so much how is it that you got this far and read all 3 books. There has to be something that kept you reading. I do have to say that the first two books are my favorite, but what I love about the third books is reading from Christian's perspective Please please o please let there be a book were Christian is Narrating maybe then we will understand what he´s really thinking. When know how Anastasia thinks but we need to know Christian better. When I finished reading 50 Shades Freed I wanted to start over from the beginning. Can´t wait for MORE.

B00BJUQP4A|5.0|Love love love maddie on things!! By far my best kindle purchase to date! If you love dogs and you love adventures then this is the book for you :)
B00C7D3TRO|4.0|Fall Out Boy really gave a good attempt to reinvent themselves but their essential sound remains throughout the album, which definitely makes it more authentic. There is a great blend of haunting classic rock riffs, hip-hop swagger, and self deprecating, emo-pining love lyrics.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Just what I was needing, works great!!<br />I've look at a number of these type of apps but this one is the best
0452289963|5.0|It is not religion. It is not doctrine. It is not political.<br />It is awakening.<br />I have the CD of Eckhart Tolle reading the book. I listen to it often.<br />It is comforting. It is inspiring. It is very sensible. It is, in fact, simple common sense.<br />Before I bought it, I borrowed the book from the library. I suggest you do the same. You will be glad. Especially if, on occasion, the thoughts in your head seem to be limiting your happiness.

B00COHAUD4|2.0|Very strange.  Not a big fan of horror movies.  Pretty far fetched story line.  I would not watch it again
B001XUIBNO|1.0|In my opinion, it was a waste of two hours.  We kept waiting for the conflict resolution, but we were very disappointed in the end.

B005ZMUXDC|5.0|my 3 year old daughter loves this movie, and I think it's pretty good too. definitely worth the money and I would buy it again.
B0070W75NQ|5.0|First off, as most folks have pointed out this is a great album. These guys have aged well and still tear it up, without resorting to tired cliches, recycling riffs/songs *coughMetalli*cough* or making essentially the same album every couple years like AC/DC since 'For Those About to Rock'. I'm not a diehard Overkill fan, there's been a clinker or two; 'Coverkill' comes to mind, but when they're on, they're on and DAMN SON, they're ON for this whole release.<br /><br />After seeing the vid for 'Electric Rattlesnake' I had to check it out. I really dug 'Ironbound', recently picked up the vinyl version of that one after getting a sweet deal on a Music Hall mmf 2.2 turntable. (Amusingly the whole rap/mc / DJ garbage was actually good for something: it breathed life back into vinyl and the hardware that goes with it). I'm not going to go into the whole audiophile argument about cd's version vinyl, but the basic fact that cd's spit out 16 bits encoded at 44.1 khz, and with a good soundcard on your pc you can pull 24 bits at 192khz off of vinyl (the best of both worlds would be DVD-Audio but sadly that format didn't catch on). The trick is, you need pristine vinyl to make it worth the effort. Which brings me to the title of this review: this 'limited edition' is actually 2 picture disks, which, while cool, usually have somewhat inferior sound quality.<br /><br />I see now there are photos of the picture disks up there but I wasn't really expecting anything but good ol' black disk. Ah well. I'm getting pretty good at applying software filters when cleaning up digitized recordings of my old thrashed albums from the 70's & 80's so taking out the additional surface noise from the picture disks shouldn't be a big deal. Just a bit annoying to get something different than what I was expecting.<br /><br />Fave song on the album: 'Drop the Hammer Down'... man, there's more great riffs in that one song than a lot groups put into an entire album! \m/_ Overkill! _\m/
B0043JDUNS|4.0|So if you like this series this is a good second to it.  I like how it evolved from the first.  Thought it was a good action movie and not a lot more.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly with Harry Bosch still has it after all these years.  One of my favorite characters and now am loving the interaction with his daughter.  Looking forward to the next adventure.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|My son and I watched this.  It is full of suspense and adventure.  There is certainly some battle scenes too.  I thought it was a good action movie for older kids.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Either this one or the SpeedCal free app are excellent calulators.  I got both (because they both were free) and I wanted to<br />compare the two what the differences were.  I have no complaints with either.  Hey???? they're both free.
B001KZG99A|4.0|I like this series and stated from the beginning again to remember all the past.  It is not an academy award winning film, but great entertainment.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This short work tells you all you need to know for how to get your work into the Kindle store. And you ca't beat the price.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|ILoved to dance to her music in the Disco era and still love her and even though I can not longer dance I still love her.
B005LAIHGI|4.0|I laughed out loud so many times I lost count.  The humor goes between ridiculously offensive and just ridiculously funny.  The supporting cast is great.<br /><br />A knowledge of world events reveals the cleverness in many of the lines.  His speech at the end reminded me of Chaplin's in The Great Dictator.  Heavy-handed social commentary, but sadly, true, as well as funny.<br /><br />Don't miss the extra scenes in the credits-- more laughing out loud!  Someone had set the safety catch to Aladeen instead of Aladeen!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|What an utterly enchanting book...enormously clever, fast paced, a complete joy to read.  I never wanted to put it down

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Doesn't disappoint as usual. I hate how he kills people off so easily though. Can't wait for the next one!
B0016OMFNY|5.0|I love this disc. I owned it when it first came out but I gave it away to a friend. (stupid mistake)
B002LII6KA|4.0|I'd give it a 3 if it weren't because this is an incredible collection at an incredible low price. So, aside from the inside of the case which came a bit messed up this offer is a bargain.
B00ABMZRVO|5.0|Its an in depth look into the dynamics of gay relationships. Touching while eye opening. A must watch. Love it !
B004132HZS|5.0|Fans of both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman need to watch this series. In my ways i think it's even better than the movies.
B00AI5AQPQ|3.0|I project the drawings while I read aloud so I don't have to try to show tiny illustrations by holding up a paperback for 24 kids to see.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Fans of both Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman need to watch this series. In my ways i think it's even better than the movies.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was a great book!  The protaganist in this book is very unique, the story line is unexpected and really grabbed my attention.  This was one of those books that I found myself making time to read so I could see where it was headed.  The author makes very effective use of blending past with present in two story lines that dove tail.  Great!
B00CL151G4|5.0|I can't beleive the trashing of this series by some people. The ones I read all said that if you have read the stories and novels you will hate this. Well I have read all the stories and novels and watched the BBC Sherlock (whcih was wonderful), and I still think this is a great, fresh, funny, well written and acted updating of Holmes. Jonny Lee Miller is a wonder! Liu is marvelous. Don't miss this series!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but I was disappointed with the ending.  I would recommend it though...first book I read by this author...will have to try her other ones.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|She  definetely is a good woman.  You may be surprised at why.  I love the setting of the 1930's  I love the movie.  I hope you do too..
B00B7XGFO4|2.0|I read the book and decided to see the movie. I liked the book but disappointed by this version of the move. This version has poor quality.
0978545095|5.0|This book in-person is so beautiful & fine, it's really difficult to do it justice. Each of Vivian Maier's black & white photographs of New York in the 1950's is a stand alone piece of art.  Her composition and intimacy with the people and places she encountered shows an innate sensitivity..  in this secret indulgence of hers.  The size of the book is larger than I thought it would be; it's thick and heavy.  This design, of course, lends to an experience of really being able to sit with the photographs, which are splendidly reproduced.  They're large and glossy.  I gave the book as a gift to a friend who lives in New York and has a cursory interest in photography (to inspire her).  She was blown away with this present!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this for my Great Niece and had to try it out. I love it. She will be delighted.
B005HEPN06|5.0|This reboot of the original series started out slow in season one but gained all kinds of momentum in later seasons.  I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Star Trek the Next Generation as the phoenix that rose Star Trek back from the ashes to greater things.
B00B671W6W|5.0|All these songs are great rock songs and Anthrax is a great band and they did these songs with respect and did these songs ,very well !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Best western I ever watched. Full of action, comedy and drama. Would watch this movie over and over again. Very good movie
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Right amount of work/fun games to earn coins for her to associate the games with earning and being able decorate her aquarium.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Its the the Goonies, what isn't there to like? One of the greatest movies to come from the 1980's ever!!!!
B003L77GGK|5.0|Bought for my son to complete his series season and he loved it.  If you're a real fan, you'll probably make this part of your collection.
1449437524|5.0|The oatmeal has a fantastic website with all sorts of funny comics.  This is probably one of his best works, esp. if you own dogs.  Anytime I'm having a bad day, this book will always chear me up!
B009HUB40Y|3.0|It's ok, but you need to constantly buy coins to play. Not what I expected. Would not recommend this item. Isn't very good even for free.
B009NNG202|3.0|A unique and interesting plot of mayhem and serial murder that leads to a weird, improbable conclusion.  Well acted, including lengthy cameo by Dustin Hoffman.  Worth a couple of hours of your time - definitely.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|I started reading the WoT books a decade and a half ago and have always wondered what Tarmon Gaidon would be like. By and large, Sanderson did not disappoint. The battles are well-paced and expertly-written. My one disappointment was the *SPOILER-lite* Hollywood ending.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game and is very fun for all ages! I love this game and its the only game I really play now!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Loved Season 1. The concept, characters and the town. Never seen it when it was on TV. Very surprised how funny it was.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this game very addictive but entertaining as more to do than other games ive played before on my beloved kindle x
B000065K6N|5.0|Everything was up to my expectations. Thank you so much! Been looking for this movie forever and I'm glad it was so cheap!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Dope graphic novel gonna buy the 2nd right now had me hooked for 2 hours and read it strait through just when u think u know what's gonna happen like on the tv show they through a left curve
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Throughout most of this book I thought either the main character was mentally challenged or had murdered this wife of his. It was incredibly childish the way he talked about their apart time. I . Won't read this book again and I'm surprised that it got such good reviews and even had a movie made after it.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|Love this show!!!!!! The drama is spicy, the men are very sexy and the supernatural horror is so jam packed!!!!! This is one show you defiantly need to watch!!!!
B000RIWAVW|4.0|The Evil is back......but it never left. One of the best horror's of it's time. It never dies...nor does Mochael Myers!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I got this game when it was on sale for free, and I have to say it's very addictive. The controls are very maneuverable, and I can tell a lot of work was put into this. Definitely worth 3 bucks!
