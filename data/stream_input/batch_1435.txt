B0054JZC6E|4.0|I wish the point values for winning were less but other then that its very time consuming like if u need to do something in spare time its good it does have a lot of ads though.
0205606288|4.0|Unfortunately, the book arrived with the hard cover unglued on one side. I needed it for a class, so had no time to return it,,,Otherwise, I like this edition. The notes are just what is needed for the modern reader to understand the text. No more, no less. The introductions and other critical material are concise and to the point.
B00005N6KG|5.0|My wife and I needed headsets to take with us to Europe. They had to be small, easy to carry, lightweight, yet capable of producing big sound. We read the reviews and decided to try two pairs of these. Bottom line: they worked great. I was a little worried about breaking them since they were always being shoved into our one carry-on bag that was stuffed with everything, including numerous heavy bottles of water, yet they held up well and performed great. Definitely worth the money.
B005S9EJZA|4.0|A marine in Iraq discovers a woman's photo, and the circumstances of the find save his life. He survives the tour and sets out to find her. Upon locating the lady, a romance ensues, in spite of her jealous ex-husband and the marine's failure to reveal why he has shown up. This is another Nicholas Sparks romance adapted for the big screen, and it is perhaps the best one yet. The film contains all the classic hallmarks of a romance: a handsome hero, a beautiful lady, a villain, and steamy romantic sequences. Men should enjoy the efforts of the film's quiet and strong protagonist to seek out his destiny, while women will like the tale of a strong woman who is struggling with a bullying ex and her feelings for the newcomer. This is a good movie for an evening out with your significant other.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|This was a good movie, especially if you like the Muppets.  People of all ages would enjoy this film.  I really enjoyed it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love playing Solitaire....lots of fun!  This is terrific on the Kindle Fire...give it a try...you will enjoy it too.  Fun
B0055SWM08|5.0|great looking game and very smooth.  it is a game type I have seen done before but they pulled it all together well with a grateful style and controls.  keep up the great work.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Love this CPU! It was easy to install and is easy to overclock if that is something anyone wishes to do. The price was just right too! The only thing I would recommend,and this goes for all CPU's, is to replace the stock CPU cooler with some kind of aftermarket one. Again, Great buy for a fast affordable i-7 CPU!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|works amazing and is there when I need it. very fast in speed and works with minimal wifi or 3g/4g coverage

B007P3TMW2|4.0|if you like the shows \\"touch\\" or \\"six degrees\\" then this movie shouldn't disappoint you. if you have no idea, but like real life with a twist, this is a winner.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is an old black and white production, but it's very entertaining and also has an element of redemption. Based on a true story, sergeant York is a very unlikely hero, but he becomes the most decorated soldier in WW1. It's a keeper.
0375826742|4.0|I found it a bit lacking - not much happened, but then again Paolini wished to elaborate more on the story, which is why he wrote a fourth book. It is better that he chose to divide the rest of the story in two books than compress it into one.
B003Y5H51K|5.0|I dont know why people are saying this is a bad movie.I found it a great movie to watch.so much so i bought 2 duds and one blu ray.But maybe someone is paying them to say this.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Springsteen manages to mature gracefully as relected on his newest release, \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" The music once again touches our souls in ways that leave you scratching your head wondering how he is able to almost read the minds of America's collective consciousness. While digging deep into current social and personal phenomena \\"Wrecking Ball\\" leaves the listener with questions and answers in ways only few contemporary songwriters can accomplish.
0307387178|5.0|I saw the movie and thought it was okay. Few years later I read the book and it blew my mind.  When McCandless wrote that letter to that 80 yr old guy (I forget his name) convincing him to get out on the road, saying something like \\"there's nothing more damaging to the adventurous spirit than a secure future,\\" that was it.  My whole outlook on life changed after that and I immediately started looking up other books about living on the road, off the land etc. I know I will probably never actually do it, but I still can't help feel like I should. My new dream.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was the author's obvious disdain for God. Mentioning, I think, four times that someone or other gave up their faith, the author really tried his hardest to make it work as a theme, as if renouncing God was somehow synonymous with renouncing the system. Kind of silly. Nonetheless, five stars. Like I said, the book changed my life.
0802798225|5.0|Originally on Fiction Freak<br />*Complimentary copy provided. This does NOT affect my review in any way.*<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry was a perfect romance. Not only was their love breaking the \\"rules\\" of the society, they also broke through the bars of racism and stereotypes, and I think that's one of the more important aspects of this book. Alejandro (Alex) Fuentes is part of the Latin Blood gang and is one of the bad boys, from the south side. Brittney is the all-popular Queen Bee of the school and captain of the cheer squad. Both are chemistry partners, and suddenly, despite their many, many, differences, they're drawn to each other, even though they know that their being together will cause problems.  It's a classic love story--except for one little bet: if Alex...end ups with Brittney he gets a car...a bit petty, isn't it? He agrees with it, thinking it as a challenge only...until he starts falling--and hard. Cliché? It should be, shouldn't it? But it's not. Brittney has to pretend everyday to be perfect while her older sister sits at home, mentally delayed. Brittney loves her sister, but she can't bring herself to tell her friends about Shelley. Alex saw his father murdered but can't remember who murdered him and is stuck in gang-business to save his family from harm. So how can these unlikely people be together?<br />Simone Elkeles weaves this romance so thoroughly that you're left with no questions asked. Danger lurks in Alex's life and wariness in Brittney's. \\"A thin line between love and hate\\" is shown in Perfect Chemistry. Alex and Brittney hate each other, and take a jab at each other whenever possible, but of course, start falling sooner than you'd think. Miss Elkeles doesn't rush into the romance as in some books I've read, she takes it gradually as if Brittney and Alex were real people falling into a relationship. Told from both POVs, you get a feel for both their emotions, confusion, determination, and hesitation. Small things, you can expect inthis story, but other things just hit me unexpectedly. The last...fifty pages? made  me just love the book even more.<br />This may be the oldest book I've reviewed, about three years old, but I'm definitely glad I read it. It was just amazing, full of romance, intrigue, and danger. It wasn't \\"dark and dangerous\\" in any paranormal way, but it had its own sense of danger of its own way, one that sent shivers down my spine. Perfect Chemistry deals with some serious things as well, like being in a gang, racism, society, and anti-drug dealing, and, like I mentioned above, I think these are the most important things of this book. I think every teen should read this...if it wasn't for the steamy scenes, that is!<br />All in all, it was a wonderful book and the epilogue with their son made me smile and laugh. I can't wait to read book two, Rules of Attraction, starring Alex's brother, Carlos, and yet another \\"snow-girl\\". I'm sure it'll be a bit cheesy, but those are the best kind of books.
0689859368|4.0|It's best to see The Field Guide as the first chapter in The Spiderwick Chronicles than as a complete book. Not much happens in this book, beyond the routine character introduction. It's more like an extended blurb for the rest of the series. But, even given the intended audience, the book feels dumbed down. I don't think that just because a book is for children, means that it can't be quality literature. This book is very short in length and in content, but further entries in the series bring in plot and action. It isn't really fair to look at this as a book, because it is banking so much on you reading further into the series.  I'd recommend picking up at least the next book in the series as well, because this book will leave you wanting more. It seems odd to say that the plot of the series doesn't come until books 2 & 3, but don't quit reading after book 1. You need to at least read the first two before you can make an informed decision.
0671042858|5.0|this book came to me in great shape almost new looking and arrived very quickly im very happy with this order!!!!
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|I already had Chamber of secrets from its original DVD release, but when I saw that they were releasing a four-disc Ultimate Edition, I was stoked! Much of the new stuff isn't what I would watch. I don't watch a lot of documentary type stuff about story boards and such, but everything else, I ate up. But, I don't see the purpose of having one disc be the theatrical version of the film and then having another entire disc for the \\"extended version.\\" But, I guess that might be a plus to someone else. The neat little art book and cards are a nice bonus as well. If you are a Harry Potter fanatic, I'd say that the new extras are worth the purchase, but the average fan probably won't get enough out of this version to validate the extra cost over the regular version. But, if you find a good price and you have the shelf space for this set (which is almost the size of three regular DVD cases) go for it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very nice animation.  even has a movie theater with scratch shorts.  easy to play and advance.  no issues on my kindle.  just go to the stuff menu, then the arrow pops up at the bottom to exit.  great free app!
0545265355|5.0|People were talking about the movie and I wanted to read the books first, so buying them through Amazon I got them fast and at a great price. Read book one which was great and then went and saw the movie. The box set is the best to buy, cause the way the story is written you have to jump into book two then book three. Great books.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|thought this movie would have been better,it was ok special affects were good in HD must have a big screen with surround sound , made the movie, price was great and I thought it was better then 300
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Anchored by a top rate performance by Robert Downey Jr., this  exciting, well directed take on Iron Man will go down as one of the best comic book movies out this generation.  The respect and love of the filmmakers for the material is evident throughout the film.  Marvel studios could not have chosen a better film to be their first independently financed and produced movie.  The movie set the bar high for all the Marvel films that came after (and it is debatable whether or not any film, including the sequel to Iron Man, ever reached that bar again).<br /><br />The 2 Disc Blu-Ray Ultimate Edition is fantastic. On the first disc you get a 47 minute documentary that explores the Iron Man comic book, from its origins to the current story lines he is involved in (at least at the time of the film's original release).  The writers and artists who have worked on Iron Man over the years take part in the documentary, discussing what changes they made to the character and why.  As someone who didn't really follow the Iron Man comic book, I found the documentary to be fascinating.  Also on the first disc is a collection of deleted/extended scenes, running for a total of 24 minutes.  Most of these are superfluous additions, bits of dialogue or action scenes that don't add anything to the story and were almost certainly taken out for pacing reasons.  There is a feature that focuses on the 4 different suits in the movie.  You can view each suit from any angle, checking out the function/feature of each piece.  I like the concept, but it takes to long to load each section.  What we're missing on this disc is something I really wanted...a director's commentary and/or a cast commentary.<br /><br />The 2nd disc is devoted to the making of the movie itself.  The highlight is a 7 part documentary that runs almost 2 hours.  It covers all aspects of the production, from initial designs, through shooting, and into the editing and special effects.  It was filmed concurrently with the production, so you get a mixture of \\"on the set\\" interviews and interviews done later looking back at the production.  As a whole, it is a well done documentary.  It isn't a classic like Heart of Darkness (which covers the filming of Apocalypse Now) or The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys (which covers 12 Monkeys), but it isn't a pure fluff piece.  I highly recommend watching this.  The 2nd disc also contains a 27 minute featurette on the special effects and Robert Downey Jr.'s screen test,<br /><br />In the end, the movie is the star here, but this is a very well done special edition.  If/when they re-release the blu-ray (probably around the release of Iron Man 3), I don't know what else they could add to make it a better edition, except for a commentary track or two.
0316098515|4.0|I got a copy of this book as part of a tasting dinner with the head chef at a club.  Also provided was a printout of the 5 dishes that we tasted.<br /><br />The lobster dish alone had over 30 \\"fiished\\" ingredients (ie not counting the individual components of some of the sauces, crumbles, oils, doughs, etc).<br /><br />The book is lovely to look at and if you do in fact have access to a huge kitchen with unlimited prep space and storage space for ingredients, it's a fun book to play in the kitchen with.  Note that this takes over-the-top multistep cooking to new levels; we are not talking mere molecular gastronomy but iterative levels of prep and ingredient lists that would make the caterers at Caligula's birthday party blush.<br /><br />Otherwise, be inspired by the \\"idea\\" of some of the flavors and try to adapt them at home. Example:  My takeaway of the Lobster Thing with Spicy Granola and 45 Different Sauces would be a lobster slad served with a curry slant.<br /><br />If you want to go the real route though and actually cook from this book, get ready to order ingredients you never heard of (and this is coming from a very jaded NYer who has never, ever had issues finding odd ingredients--I had no idea there was such a thing as \\"violet mustard\\") and brace yourself for recipes that have steps akin to \\"process in your fusion reactor for ten minutes.  Please note that if you don't have a professional fusion reactor, Williams-Sonoma is debuting a small (3qt) countertop model, the \\"FusiGlow 9000\\" this Spring.  It will retail for $2,777.00 and will be available in white, black, pistacio, and brushed stainless (note:  The black and pistacio are currently backordered).\\"<br /><br />While the recipes may never make it onto your plate, the book is a definite coffee table/foodie gift pick (especially if you can't drop $500+ for \\"Modernist Cuisine\\").
B003R50AW8|4.0|Loved this book! Engaiging characters and a compelling plot. Kept you guessing too. I especially enjoyed picking the progression in writing and concept that becomes \\"The Book Thief\\".
0545265355|5.0|I rarely stick to the end of trilogies, but I did with this one. Katniss is a character anyone should be able to identify with. A person used by the society, exploited by both sides of the politics. Modern tragic character in my view. She had no chance from the beginning. Even though some might say she is a victor, in my eyes she was chewed up and spat out by the society, and the only thing she is, is still alive. There are wounds that will never heal. She didn't have a chance to experience love, to choose who she will fall in love with, to make mistakes, to learn from them. The society forced itself upon her, but so did Gale and Peeta. That's why I liked it when she said she could go on without any of them. She needed time to process what happened to her. A revolution of her own in a way.<br />I pondered whether this would be a 4 star or 5, because of the third book, but I decided to go with 5. The overall feeling is - a great trilogy that will be hard to top.

B004OR1X6A|5.0|This is a very good package and should be purchased by all Rory's fans (and everyone else, too!).  Rory's brother did a great job here in preserving the legacy of this fine, fine guitarist.  The live CD is outstanding, in my opinion.  Rory is absolutely \\"smoking\\", right from the start.  It is comparable to the Live Tour 74' CD in sound quality, and may have even more power.  The studio Photo-Finish remaster also sounds great.  The two bonus tracks are vintage Rory, and both very nice to have (as a fan of who I believe was among the greatest guitarists who ever lived).  Those who were disappointed with the STAGE STRUCK live CD of the same time period (1979) will be most pleased with this package, I am sure.  The STAGE STRUCK CD was marred by a loud buzz on the entire recording.  Play the live CD from this San Francisco package on a good stereo, and you will feel like Rory came back from the dead to play in your living room.  I guarantee it.

B005S9EK1S|3.0|Being the only male in the audience on a Friday afternoon, pretty much tells you what you are getting with \\"The Lucky One\\". As the lights came up as the credits rolled, I turned around to see myself standing among fifteen to twenty women, some were teared up, some weren't. Nicholas Sparks, the writer of the novel, has made a career off of books and movies that touch people's hearts. The biggest of those was \\"The Notebook\\", but \\"A Walk to Remember\\" & \\"Message in a Bottle\\" were notable as well.<br /><br />While most of Spark's novels are tailor made for women, I found \\"The Notebook\\" to be something that everything could relate to with its theme of Alzheimer's. \\"The Lucky One\\" on the other hand, had many opportunities to reach a broader audience but brush stroked over those. I enjoyed \\"The Lucky One\\", but for some reason, it didn't quite affect me like \\"The Notebook\\" did. That may be because it didn't spend enough time in certain areas.<br /><br />First of all, Zac Effron (High School Musical, 17 Again) plays Logan, a survivor of Iraqi freedom who stumbles upon a picture of Beth (Taylor Schilling) lying in a pile of rocks after a night raid. All we learn about Logan happens in the length of the opening credits. The problem with \\"The Lucky One\\" may just have been that the characters were all too interesting. There is depth to the characters, but the montages that are used to get all the information across are empty and unexplored. Sparks also did a movie called \\"Dear John\\" that had so many montages, I thought I was watching a two-hour commercial for Hallmark. I hate montages.<br /><br />In the first four minutes of the film, we see Logan survive some war situations, see him return home with a picture that saved his life and see that he has a lot of post-traumatic stress. All of which is very interesting, but it happens in a montage and we lose all the emotion from it.  Once the movie gets going though, to its credit, we start to see some real emotions coming out, especially from Schilling's character. She does an outstanding job portraying her sadness and her struggles as a single mother dealing with a lot of issues. Effron, on the other hand, is stuck playing a character that had his best parts portrayed in montage and for the rest of the movie, plays the perfect man. What else would you expect?<br /><br />\\"The Lucky One\\" is just an okay movie that gives everybody that enjoys these type movies exactly what they're looking for. It has two beautiful people falling in love. It has drama. It has beautiful cinematography. It has all the clich&eacute;' things that make a movie like this safe from criticism and just outside the realm of memorable. As rich as the characters were, I just wish some of those character traits would have been fleshed out more.ally from Schilling's character.

B000069HK2|3.0|Good album, but the last two songs do not play on any cd player - not in my car or on my computer :( - Don't see any major scratches or anything on the disk.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Randomly heard this book on a late night radio program in bits and pieces, after the 2nd day I had to get this book and read the rest of the story.  So many of the times and places emotionally and literally he mentions are so reminiscent of those '80's years.  I enjoyed the closure to the unrequited love.  The ending was so unexpected, I my heart ached with the hurt. There was just so much to like and love as to characters and story wise, I could see a movie from this book.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|It didn't blow me away the way the first season did.  I think simply bc it wasn't new but the first and third episodes this season are some of the best tv I've ever seen.  This is on par with breaking bad or sopranos I think.  The 90 minute episode format is great and both Sherlock and Holmes will be movie stars this time six months from now as Holmes is bilbo baggins in the hobbit.  I can't rate highly enough this leaves our law and order and csi shows in JV, this show is the real deal.  Great ending too and I love how they came back from last season.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you get to play many different games however it gets difficult to open new levels. some of the directions are hard to understand.

1439127700|5.0|I am sick and tired of reading the comments from idiots who are crying that their e-book version is to expensive, then rate the book at 1 due to cost not content. It is your problem if you got 'sucked' into the latest high-tech device. Suck it up!
B001C3KCSY|4.0|I give the CD 5 Stars, but my overall experience with the length of time to get the item, and no tracking info made me give 4 stars for overall experience...but the CD is amazing...I highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first of the trilogy (Fifty Shades of Grey) I could not wait to start this book.  Each chapter makes it harder to put the it down.  The arthur makes you get lost in the story and stirs passion you did not know you even wanted. Could not wait to start the third and now that I have finished all of them I want more.  I did hear a rumor a movie is in the making.  All I can say is if its close to the books the A/C in the theatre better be on HIGH!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Really enjoying these free games. Very addictive! Play on both my ipod and Kindle fire. So many different games.  Come play!  Trying to enter comments!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Season 2 was amazing! Excellent character development, many twists and turns with the plot, and a ton of surprises. Cannot wait for Season 3.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Many people referred this to me as feminist, but that's certainly not true unless you consider having a female protagonist doing archery immediately feminist (in this day and age, I expect quite a bit more than that from feminism, thank you very much). Any female character other than Katniss is portrayed negatively, is unimportant, or gets fridged (if you don't know the term, look it up).<br /><br />The book is poorly written and exceptionally bad in its pacing. The book wasn't the worst thing I've ever read (though that title goes to the third book of the trilogy--Mockingjay), though I don't recommend it for more than a cursory read. Suzanne Collins obviously did no research on things like archery or survival (crucial to the story). Trust me, it shows. The most egregious lack of research comes on the topic of starvation. Starving is *not* the same thing as being fashionably thin. In addition, poorly fed people don't grow up to be huge like several of the characters in this book (Gale and Thresh are the immediate examples, but there are others).<br /><br />The plot is filled with utterly stupid contrivances and forced plot lines (the romance plot line, for example, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever). Peeta manipulates Katniss into a position of having to kiss him and then is actually upset that she doesn't genuinely reciprocate his feelings. Katniss thinks he has a valid complaint. What on earth is even going on with these people? (By the way: FEMINISM! [insert eyeroll here])<br /><br />In other words, I don't recommend it if you're spending money. Get it from the Kindle Owner's Lending Library or your local library: don't pay for it. It won't hold up to a reread. One thing I will say is that it's a decent trashy read--but do yourself a favor and let the Hunger Games end with the first installment. Don't read the sequels. The quality declines steeply from here, and that's saying something.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the game just wish the energy would increase faster! you cant do much when you run out of energy then it takes 2mins to get one energy!
1416511946|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It gave me hope for someone I love who is a heroin addict :/<br />It was very raw and descriptive and you could feel Nikki's pain and hope.  If he could get<br />clean and sober, ANYONE can!  (I could have done without some of the pics)
B006JTS5OO|5.0|The Muppets is full of catchy music and lots of laughs for our young family (kids are 4 and younger). The three-disc collection was a great value ($26). The only thing I wish I would have known is that the digital copy is stored online at Disney and not directly on our computer. Not a big deal, except we need internet access to watch it (had considered using ipod to allow kids to watch on long road trips). I'm glad the Muppets are back!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This is a fun CD...something new and very different from Paul McCartney.  I think he has the knack that no matter what he sings, it sounds good!
B006ZT47O0|2.0|I really was excited about this album, waiting for it after the masterpiece DESIGN YOUR UNIVERSE. The production of DUY is amazing! It convinced me to buy a record player and get the vinyl pressing, and thank god I did !!! Being that RFTI had the same producer as DYU, I knew this had to be another winner<br /><br />OH MY GOD WAS I WRONG ...<br /><br />First thing I noticed after the intro \\"Karma\\", PRODUCTION !!!! What the hell happened to Sascha Paeth! Is this the same producer, can't be but apparently it is !!!! For those who dont know, Sascha Paeth produced many top albums by Kamelot, Rhapsody, any big symphonic european metal band and never failed to deliver, except for this one. The guitars have a weird tone, buried in the music, (like Epica's first two albums on Transmission Records) and the snare drum sounds like a paper bag. Just listen to the DESIGN YOUR UNIVERSE and how the power and perfect production of guitars & drums kicks in after the Intro into the second song. You should hear that again, if you had the same producer. But not even close !!! Instead, I felt like a deer in the headlights and I just got hit :(<br /><br />Did anyone one notice this besides me? Did I get a defective copy?<br /><br />Ok, so I listened more but my ears wanted to cry. Next thing I notice, and I think some others feel the same. The song structure, It doesn't flow right, the transitions aren't that smooth as it was in DYU & TDC. Simone's vocals are also not a powerful as DYU, there good but they can be better. As for Mark's grunts, they don't balance as well with the songs like DYU.<br /><br />I found some catchy riffs and enjoyed bits and pieces of a few song, but was unable to enjoy a song from start to finish. I believe the songs may of \\"felt\\" better if Sascha Paeth had the same mindset as DYU, then I could of given it another star or two, but what is happening to their songwriting & Sascha Paeth. To me Epica was climbing a ladder to more successful releases, as Design YourUniverse was the top. I was so excited to see what more the God Dethroned new members can bring in at this level, instead I am afraid, with this album Epica is falling down from the top of the ladder. Please grab back on and climb higher!<br /><br />For those who gave this album 5 starts, please listen to Design Your Universe !!! everything in DYU is balanced perfectly, a perfect universe. You will notice a BIG difference is so many things PRODUCTION, SONG STRUCTURE, HOOKS, POWERFUL GUITARS/VOCALS/DRUMS. Maybe you will then have the dear in the headlights look like I had. What is even sadder is that this is the SAME producer, Sascha Paeth !!! Not even other albums that he had produced sounded this bad.
B003IEJZUG|3.0|At first I enjoyed the book.  The middle I did not, it dragged on too long.  The end was disappointing to me.
0670023329|5.0|I don't have the words that could better describe what has already been said by others.<br />My one original thought is why  the news media never highlighted  what was happening in North Korea.  I am aware<br />that our diplomats dare not mention \\"human rights\\" when they meet with the evil ones and accomplish nothing with<br />these monsters.  We should tell them something of Stalin, Hitler and others and if they leave the room who cares?
B005S9EJZA|3.0|At this point, it's become way too easy to track the formulaic path of any Nicholas Sparks adaptation. Vaguely sketched characters lust for love in the midst of barely defined, supposedly trying circumstances, with very little real drama to be found. Those looking for sexual sizzle tend to walk away hot, bothered, and unfulfilled. Doesn't matter which no-name director takes the helm, the creative results are the same and roughly the same amount of people show up.<br /><br />Ironic that Sparks' cookie cutter, conveyor belt brand of romance so frequently revolves around the idea of destiny and fate. The Lucky One stars Zac Efron as Marine Sgt. Logan Thibault, the luckiest soldier serving in Iraq after finding the photo of a mysterious blond beauty buried in the sand. The image serves as his good luck charm, surviving many an altercation that left his squad mates dead. They apparently weren't smart enough to carry photos of hot chicks in their back pockets. They're a real life saver.<br /><br />Discharged, Logan sets out to find the woman he thinks saved his life. After a disastrous stop at home where his PTSD is flared by a pair of rambunctious nephews, he pulls a Forrest Gump and hoofs it(along with his \\"Awww\\" inspiring doggie pal) from Colorado to idyllic, unnaturally sparkling North Carolina, where he meets Beth(Taylor Schilling), the woman from the photo and owner of rundown dog kennel. After the prerequisite misunderstanding and Logan's unexplained inability to reveal the truth, he winds up scooping puppy poop for Beth and her wise old grandmother(the excellent Blythe Danner).<br /><br />Sparks typically ladles on the melodrama like thick gravy. Beth has a precocious 7-year old son who bonds with Logan over chess and playing the violin. She also has a lunk-headed jerk of an ex-husband(Jay R. Ferguson), the town sheriff's deputy who uses his law enforcement and legal connections to make her virtually untouchable to the opposite sex. Did we mention that her grandma is sick, and that her parents died while she was young? The only thing that could make it worse is if she were to fall in love with a studly stranger and invoke the violent ire of her ex-hubby. Oh..wait, that's exactly what happens.<br /><br />If there is a Michael Bay of romance films, Nicholas Sparks has proven time and time again that he is it. He nails some of the bigger emotional moments, especially as Logan and Beth's courtship leads to a surprisingly steamy(for a Sparks film, anyway) shower scene. However, Sparks fails in all of the small details that make a story feel complete. Beth's ex is cartoonishly evil, reminiscent of the bullies you'd see in 80s teen comedies. As usual there are very few real stakes involved, and the resolution is never in doubt even for a moment. One thing in Sparks' favor is that he tweaks the inevitable death of a major character, veering away from his norm and raining hell on the unfortunate victim in a way that was the most unexpected aspect of the story.<br /><br />The only thing that saves the film from total disaster are strong performances by Efron, Schilling, and Danner. For Efron, he's in over his head when trying to act like a hardened soldier, his laughable post-traumatic rages getting the film off to a rocky start it struggles to overcome. He improves later on, showing a real growth as an actor and overcoming a weak kneed script. Sparks novels, and movies for that matter, target the female audience but more often than not feature poorly realized women characters and worse performances. Schilling is a welcome breath of fresh air, equal parts beauty and strength, giving Beth a dignity we don't get to see often enough.<br /><br />The Notebook is always cited as the best of his adaptations, and that is true to some extent because of its mesmerizing stars. However, a look back at it reveals that Sparks was merely setting the stage for a career of weak plots and poorly defined, sappy characters. The Lucky One continues that trend, appealing only to the Sparks converted looking for an easy, comfortable, love story.rend, appealing only to the Sparks converted looking for an easy, comfortable, love story.
B00005ONMO|5.0|I do not own this entire boxed set, but owned the 2nd symphony and song cycle 2 disc set.  Sinopoli's tempos and transitions are slower than many of the established favs, (Bernstein & Solti), but I think they are perfect.  The finale has a more glorious and steady flow and not as hurried as other version seems to \\"rush\\" to get to the end.  Sinopoli savors this moment and it is wonderful.  Fantastic intonation and a very warm tone overall.  Looking forward to hearing his visions of the other symphonies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a fun collection if your looking to pass tine time and a nice little bundle. it's free so why not give it a shot
B007V2UGPE|5.0|thought the start of the game was good. no idea what happens next. good waste of time. oh well. no likely the pay for better stuff part.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very easy to use. I would recommend to all friends. easy to understand directions and User guide.  my kids love to play with me.
6305090564|5.0|Back in 2003 when I was 10 I was flicking through stations and stumpled upon 'Deep Rising' which was airing on abc. Since then it's been my favorite monster movie. The dialog while not the best is fun and includes some cool one-liners. The acting is also pretty good by the whole cast.<br /><br />These days with films being re-released in 3D, I think this movie should be included in the conversation. And why hasn't hollywood pictures given this a \\"special edition\\" dvd instead of just a bare to bones release like it did. Also the only way to get this will be only online, because thanks to Hollywood P. at the end of this month the dvd will be out of print.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|The Lucky One is an interesting, lovable book that explored each characters background thoroughly and then brought the characters together.  The way Sparks had to go back in time to let the readers know why things happened the way they did was creative and made the reader have a better understanding of the scenario. War affects more than the soldier. Even though Thibault had horrific life experiences as a soldier, he maintained a deep understanding of what love could be and used his quirky patience to move in the right direction.  He knew what he wanted and did not want to do something to destroy his trust with Beth.  He was willing to do what it took to do the right thing.  His mystery of the photo was an adventure to find the person who he believed saved his life.  Originally, he had no other intentions but to find that person. He was the \\"Lucky One\\".  Loved it!
0345529057|5.0|This condition of the books are awesome. The books were delivered on time, I am simply enjoying all four of these books. I recommend everyone buy and read them.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I know without a doubt having this case saved me from having to purchase another Kindle Fire. I was stepping onto the freight elevator at work when my Kindle slipped from my hands. There's a space between the elevator and the floor and my Kindle actually slid into that space and fell down 3 floors. I could hear it smacking into the wall as it fell. I was pretty sure that was the end of my Kindle. I had to wait until the next day for the building engineer to retrieve it. The first thing that surprised me was that my Kindle was completely intact. I hit the power button, knowing for sure it wouldn't turn on, but it did! Everything is working just fine. It's almost as though it never fell 3 floors down an elevator shaft. I am one happy customer and would highly recommend this case to protect your Kindle.
B006UG90RM|3.0|One star rating for each good song on the CD.  The rest are all \\"meh\\".  I should have bought a box of Twinkies instead.
0439023491|1.0|Wow. I haven't seen the movie, nor have I read, Hunger Games. Thanks, Amazon, for telling me something in your review of \\"Catching Fire\\" that, I assume, is an important part of the suspense of the story line of Hunger Games. Usually, who is the winner in a story about a game is really rather important to the enjoyment of the story.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|OK I've read the first two books before I started this. Mostly I listened to them with my wife. I don't really like Audio Books because I don't retain what I've heard like when I read it.<br /><br />  For the first book (THE HUNGER GAMES) I just want to compare it to the move that recently was released. The second book (CATCHING FIRE) I want to tell all the things they can't fallow through because of the changes from the first movie. In conclusion I've decided not to write anything on them here.<br /><br />  For this book I fell strait into it without any warnings, I read it in two days. I love how this book picks up right where the second leaves off. You can't really follow along with what's going on if you have not read the first two. In every one of these books something happens that I'm not ready for or I think will happen later. This book series should be a must read on anyone's list. My wife and I listened to the first to together and now we read the last one together. I'm interested to see if Suzanne Collins has any other great works for me to read. The writhing stile is at a high school level for the Comprehension but the reading is around young adult level.<br />  Please read this great work of art along with the other Two.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|as I said before I'm just doing this for points la la la la la la la la la la
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This Trilogy has had me wound for over a week now since I have finished reading. I was lost from the moment I hit purchase. Now I had debated for a month or so on if it was worth the money and my oh my it is for sure! Dont overthink this book...Love it for what it is!
B0078XGJQQ|5.0|This book is truly 'Magic', it has changed the way I think completely. I really am so grateful for everything and each day.<br />Am now reading it again to make sure I have covered all the bases. If you liked 'The Secret' you will love this.  Well worth the read.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I must admit I was hesitant to buy this for my son's 5th birthday. Especially after reading all the reviews and how an architect had trouble building these designs.  Well other than on a couple of cards where you have to simultaneously place objects at the same time all the cards were relatively easy to construct. However, my son primarily uses it as an imagination toy rather than a game. It is his favorite toy.  I'd like to point out that he is actually able to self construct the majority of the cards by himself using only the included game parts(and the remainder with my help). However, knocking them down is more luck than art. Unfortunately, I am no engineer and I do not design houses, roads, or cities just an ordinary Mom playing with her children.<br /><br />If you are looking to add to it Jenga ( a game even my 16 year old loves so dual purpose there) and wood blocks make a great addition especially if you do struggle building with the orginal.  Only downside is your living room may look like mine a city block with massive building structures everywhere that is bombed daily and repeatedly with constant vigor.
0345529057|4.0|If you haven't read the series yet or if you know someone who hasn't this is a good way to get all the books at once at a bargain. The quality was fine. As for the content, I didn't think this would be my cup of tea but I picked up the first one and couldn't put it down. It's a little over the top (I couldn't help rolling my eyes at times), and Martin tends to drag on and on at other times, but the story and characters do suck you in. Pretty soon you have to keep reading (besides, in my opinion, there is never any real ending to any book. Martin just stops writing!) I haven't seen the HBO version of this series so I can't say how it translates into television but I prefer reading anyway. I would say this series offers more than the entertainment value than the cost. Good for all ages over 13.
B005MMYEF8|4.0|I really enjoy this series and watch it over and over in my spare time. lots of action and great acting.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I think this app is brilliant for the Kindle Fire! Fast and easy! Great way to transfer photos from computer to Kindle!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was a great read and a fast read. When I finished it, I found myself looking forward to a 2nd movie being made to see what they did with the characters. Of course the books are always better, but the first movie was good and followed the book fairly well. However, when I got to the third book, I was definitely not interested in a 3rd movie and had all I could do to finish the 3rd book.  Too bad, it should have been a great trilogy!.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I recently purchased a Toshiba NB-500D Netbook to replace my failed Advent 4211C netbook. I was dismayed to find that although these two netbooks have virtually identical specs, processor speeds, disks, etc, the Toshiba was pathetically slow compared to the Advent, and this is because it uses Windows 7 instead of Windows XP, and as Win 7 is a notorious memory hog, with only 1Gb there was very little memory left over for 'real' work to be done - in my case only about 160Mb.<br /><br />The obvious answer was to increase the available RAM, and this is where the Kingston ValueRAM module came to the rescue. I ordered it from Amazon, and within two days it had been delivered from the US to Cyprus. The installation was simple, taking more time to remove and replace the bottom cover than anything else. Do make sure that the module is properly and securely inserted into the socket!<br /><br />After replacing the cover, the power up sequence immediately reported the increased RAM, and, thankfully, the improvement in performance was well worth it. If your netbook is crippled by Windows 7 running in only 1Gb, then try increasing the RAM, and this vendor certainly gets my vote!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|A disappointing third and final book of Hunger Games.  First two were good, but this one I only finished because I purchased it.  Won't see the movie for this one! It was like trying to \\"read\\" action scenes from Starwars.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|read the reviews on the Play store.  people spend money on Glu credits and upgrades and then updates to the app reset all progress.  Glu support is unresponsive!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard about this book I thought \\"who would want to read a book about children killing children?\\" Then I realized it was so much more. Its about what happens when government takes control of every aspect of your life and you lose your freedom. Scary thought; great book.
0439023521|5.0|A captivating read.  My 2 sons couldn't put down the book. They are enthusiastically reading the rest of the series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun game. if you like farmville or cityville you will love it. download it and give it five stars
0553103547|3.0|Before I begin this review, please allow me to make perfectly clear that I am not the sort of person to leave a bad review for a book simply because it contains mature themes or dark thematic elements. In fact, when done well, those are some of my favorite kinds of stories. If I'd read this as a child, I might have either been shocked by this book or else not understood half of what was going on, being a grown-up reading this, however, I should have been part of the target audience so to speak. I love to read epic fantasy books (I never finished Lord of the Rings, but I liked what I did read, and I've read all the His Dark Material books, as well as Once Upon a Winter's Night, Neil Gaiman's Stardust, two of the 500 kingdom novels, and many other fantasy books for young adults and grown-ups), and I enjoy lengthy character POVs.<br /><br />At first, I was completely in love with this book. I was charmed by the Stark children (Sansa, Arya, and Jon Snow all felt like very real and likable persons to me and I thought about them constantly, even when I wasn't reading), with the exception of Bran who, although nice, I suppose didn't chew enough of the scenery, failing to leap off the page the way many of his POV siblings did. I adored the direwolves. I honestly thought I'd never heard of anything more delightful or creative than a whole family of children getting their own direwolf. Even Jon Snow, having found the white one he named Ghost. Even our 'villians' were engaging and fully fleshed out in the story.<br /><br />So how did I go from loving the book so well that I would have easily given it five stars to only thinking 'it's okay' and leaving a mere three stars?<br /><br />Well, it's a bit of a long story.<br /><br />As is the book itself.<br /><br />I understand that it's a series, and I knew from the first that the book would not end with closure, what I was not expecting was to be honesty plain TIRED of the constant mature referrences dropped, originally every few chapters or so, but with increasing frequency I began to be irked by, as the novel went on. We GET it, the adult characters sleep around with harlots! We don't NEED details on the dwarf doing it! We just DON'T. All the more so as we want to find out what happens to everyone. And as a reader, I felt my IQ was being slapped, because it seemed to just hit the reader over the head with the fact that the queen commited incest, and a key character is the result of this. YES, we GET it. Thanks George R.R. Martin, but my attention span is not THAT short. I could have picked it up even if you chose to be more subtle. I half-wanted to scream at the page, \\"Can we please MOVE ON?\\"<br /><br />Really, I didn't mind the incest, or the constant referrences to brothels, when I felt, earlier on, that they were explaining the history and lives of the people involved. When it got to the point where it felt like nothing but pointless mature scenes and f-word drops, I felt exasperated.<br /><br />But to be fair the book is not awful. It is well worth reading for Arya's chapters, as we as her sister Sansa's. They were so colourful, so interesting. They kind of reminded me of Lucy and Susan from Narnia, personailty-wise. Jon Snow's chapter's too are engaging, as are Dany's, and even the chapters that irked me, I grudgingly admit, they were well-written. The author can CLEARLY tell a good story, I just wish he could be more tasteful about it. There is a difference between mature themes and a gross-out factor. If he would only learn when to use them and when to hold back, this book would have dazzled.<br /><br />Early on, reading the book, I had been planning to buy the first season of the show to watch with my grandparents. However, having heard from reliable sources that it was VERY faithfully adapted even to the point of ADDING MORE mature scenes, and very graphic ones at that, I decided it wasn't for me. I'll keep the book, because writing-wise (I am a writer) it's fairly inspiring, butI don't want the show and I probably won't be buying the sequels. I'll pick 'em up from the library, if I'm bored or something. Instead of Game of Thrones, I've just gone and ordered the BBC's Merlin on dvd; because it's creative enough to keep my attention and, unlike Game of thrones, I wouldn't be embarrased to watch it round my grandparents, nor would I have to constantly fast-forward.<br /><br />So three stars for amazing characters. Not a full five stars, sadly, due to the fact that the story was not in good taste enough so that I could readily recommend it to my family and friends.I don't want the show and I probably won't be buying the sequels.

B0040UAYI4|1.0|This thing is a complete piece of s***.  I have built computers from parts and had an easier time than trying to deal with this device.  The instructions don't match the actual software interface, and the help files are nonexistant.  Some people have said that everything works fine.  Not the case for me.  Good luck if you buy this, I wouldn't again given the choice.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|We love our Kindles, but having the option to continue reading our current books on other devices is just too cool.  It picks up where you left off as long as the WiFi is on regardless of what device you are on.  We use it on our Kinles of course, our smart phones, and now our ePads.  The vendor of the ePad said Kindle would not work without a difficult download of an older version of the app; then an update by replacing it with a new app.  None of that was required.  I just downloaded the Kindle app for Android and it works right out the shoot.  It even does somethings better than the Kindle itself.  The battery is much better on the Kindle, but having the ePad option just makes it even better.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These three books were phenomenal! The stories told were well written and kept my interest the entire time. I did not want to stop reading even to sleep. The previews for the movie sparked my interest, but the books themselves kept me enthralled. I would highly reccomend these books to anyone.
B000WQW988|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite cds and now its one of my favorite DVDs very fun show
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love that both the main character, and the man she falls for, are both well described. I love that the author doesn't just tell us, \\"now they like each other\\".  You feel a growing respect, and trust forming between them.  The characters both develop into 3-dimensional realistic people.<br />  I enjoy a strong heroine who speaks for herself and is loved for who she is.  She doesn't need rescuing, she rescues herself.  I really appreciate that about her, and that I can identify with her.  Who hasn't been made to feel stupid, by their own design or others?  Who hasn't read a situation wrong due to lack of self esteen or self worth, and misconstrude a situation?<br />Thank you to Mrs. Kinsella for another new favorite to be re-read and delighted with!<br />Jennifer
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|I enjoyed this biography. I had no previous knowledge of Steve Jobs. I'm in my late 50's and although I use ITC, I do not have an intuitive undersatanding of technology.<br />I found Jobs's biography informative in the development of Apple computers and the now associated tech devices ie, ipads, ipods shuffles etc. fascinating. His thinking intrigued me.<br /><br />I don't think I could have tolerated being in the same room as the man. But I found his vision extraordinary.<br /><br />The competition between Apple and PC developers now makes sense.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, I really know nothing about computers. This biography helped me to gain a picture of one of the most dynamic and innovative people who transformed communication devices in the late 20th Century.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game it plays good no problems just what I was looking  for!!!!!!!!!!! Would recommend it highly no bugs great game!!!!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|There's not a lot of tv shows that I want to spend money on to obtain the series on dvd, but Big Bang Theory is not the usual tv series.  I actually have a wonderful time watching the series and enjoy reruns as much as new episodes.  Comedy shows that actually make me laugh and happy - that's what BBT is for me.  If you're a fan of the show, get the sets and enjoy the fun all over again.  Even better is that there is no commericials.  I'm getting these and will buy the entire series and I'm guessing you'll love it as much as I do.  I have turned friends and family onto this series and they have been converted into fans as well.  Hours of enjoyment - what more can one ask for?
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I hardly know where to begin! It speaks volumes to the talent and poetry of Bob Dylan that his music can cross so many genres and generations of music and musicians. From Johnny Cash to Kei$ha, From Pete Seeger to half of the groups on the CD's that I never even heard of before. With only 3 or 4 exceptions, I like every one of the 74 cuts on these four CD's. The songs cover the length and breadth of Dylan's career, with many renditions true to form and many with a number of twists on the originals. For over 5 hours of music, I'd have to say that @ $23 it's one of the sweetest music bargains I've run across in many a year. Enjoy, folks!
B003L77G6A|4.0|I love Big Bang Theory and will get the entire series on dvd.  I've turned friends, coworkers, and family to BBT fans too.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that some aspects of the girlfriends and plot twists may not always work, but the show is still smart, funny, and a joy to watch.  I hope the writers get it together for more great seasons to come.  It hasn't jumped the shark yet and I have big hopes for more enjoyment in future seasons.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is worth all the hype. I loved the book, and will most likely see the movie as well. Twilight Saga, move over!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I loved the first season and this second season too.  Great writting, funny, interesting characters, a great cast, and smart.  It's a joy to watch and my family and friends are falling for the series too.  If you're not already a fan, you may not know what your missing and should give the series a chance.  I can't get enough of the show.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was surprised I loved this book, could not put it down, ended up ordering the other 2 books in the series
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was more than i expected! I never read books that make it to the yahoo page but i was curious. After reading the first chapter (which usually determines whether i read it) i was blown away. I read a lot of romance novels, they are really sweet with hearts and flowers. However i can't put myself in their shoes, they never seem realistic. Not that I'm saying I'll meet a hunky CEO with a dark side but hey you never know! I like the story because the blueprint of the male character can be placed on a few guys i know. Men aren't perfect, and that's what i usually see in other romance novels. This story Mr. Grey has some serious problems, and it takes some time for him to work those out. The characters don't fall in love in a day and marry the next.They have to work for their love, besides that the heroine stands her ground(in some cases). The sex scenes are very hot,and the romance even better. You won't be disappointed.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|There is a reason why so many people are addicted to this game.  It is fun and challenging.  As you would expect it gets progressively more difficult, but the developers also give the player progressively more effective weaponry, i.e. new mutant birds with more destructive power.

B007549YM4|4.0|This film has gotten quite a bit of love and hate.  For me, the film made me really question whether surviving would be worth it and what would I do or become if I were to survive a horrific event, only to be trapped with other survivors.  I am sure you can read more about the movie all over the internet, so I shall rate the product.<br /><br />There isn't anything very tantalizing about the special features with this movie.  You get the same features on the DVD or DVD/BluRay combo, so if you want to save a few dollars and aren't all caught up in the BluRay craze, I recommend just picking up the DVD.  You get a commentary, which, granted, may add to the knowledge behind the movie, but I tend to feel that commentaries ruin movies for me, so I avoid them. Then you have the Trailer...Which is odd, because I would think, with the lack of other special features, they would put all of the trailers they had on the disk...but regardless, you can watch the trailers online, so it's not really all that Special of a Feature.  I wish they would have put a blooper reel on the special features just to lighten the mood after such a heavy film.  It would have been nice to mentally relax after watching the movie with a good chuckle.  Also, I would have liked to have seen a short or something, perhaps...in comic book style, about what led to the disaster in NYC...though...that may ruin the purpose of the film and the intentional ambiguity of it all.  C'est la vie.<br /><br />For settings, I was pleased to see that there were English SDH subtitles, as my partner is deaf.  English Subtitles are great and all, but it's really nice when they are SDH subs.  It allows all persons to be aware of other sounds rather than just spoken words.  I was very pleased they took the time to put that setting on the disk.<br /><br />The main menu is run-of-the-mill.  We've seen it done a million times, nothing really special there.  And you have your typical scene selection.<br /><br />The run-time at 122 minutes felt very long the first time I watched the film, but perhaps that was because it was so intense and I was holding my breath through much of the film.  The second time I watched the film, I felt it seemed shorter, but that may be due to the fact that I could remind myself to breathe now and again as the movie continued.<br /><br />As for graphic violence in the movie...It's not nearly as gag inducing as Saw or Hostel.  It doesn't find itself in the torture-porn spectrum, but be forewarned...This movie is a psychological film and a lot of the things that occur WILL mess with your head.  I felt very empty...Like I lost a part of myself when watching this film, especially at the end.  The desperation created in the film seemed far too real to me.<br /><br />So, all in all, if you want a movie that really just messes with your head and causes one of those deep anxiety internal conversations, I recommend watching this film, but don't expect much in the way of special features or extra pieces added for depth.  If you are or someone you are watching this with prefers subtitles...This disc will be excellent viewing for them.  The dialogue, as far as I could tell, was not changed/shortened.  As far as I noticed, it was word for word, so those reading the subtitles won't be missing out.<br /><br />I am not saying you will enjoy the film...But at least you know what you are purchasing if you want this movie.2 minutes felt very long the first time I watched the film, but perhaps that was because it was so intense and I was holding my breath through much of the film.

B004XUMRBI|5.0|Amazing show with great character development. It's a great television travesty that this show was cut short.<br />As a testament to how good it was, fans raised the money to support the production of a movie so some closure could be had.<br />Now that's fan dedication!
B0051HNMTI|4.0|pretty good. please add skip to each workout. sometimes I don't like the order of routines and would like an option to skip to next

0345803485|5.0|I am not into these types of books whatsoever! On face book everyone was reading it so my son and his g/f got it for me and I am on day 3 and have less than an hour to go before the book ends. I find the erotic part a bit much but can't put it down. I need to know what happens to this couple.<br />Bravo to the Author!
B007C9N4H8|5.0|was really cool to experience the muppets with her since my husband and i are both fans.  the picture was off sometimes, but not enough to bother us.  had a great cast and a lot of awesome surprise star guests that we both love.  only wish i would have purchased it instead of rented it.  would love watching this over and over again, instead of her current favorite movie the care bears! lol
B003MYYJD0|5.0|I've been a fan of Invicta for about 8 years & they never disappoint. Not to heavy, perfect mix of the black & the gold. Can't go wrong.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I found the story very entertaining, even for adults.  I was pre-reading before suggesting to my grandchildren and I enjoyed the stories and recommended to my grandchildren.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|Works every time. Connects quickly - has lots of options and works great! I use this program multiple times a day for watching my son. It takes less then 5 seconds to open and connect to the camera. You can see more then 1 camera at a time if you want.  In the upper right corner it always tells you the time the date and what camera you are connected to. I love this program.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book!  I picked it up as soon as I finished the first book.  Better than book one, not as good as book two!
B004GFN11A|5.0|I have used this app for a month or 2 now.  I love it. It makes it very easy to post - update - edit- to your blog. You can upload videos or images. It has a drop down for category so you can see which ones you are using. There isn't one for tags though. Something I wish I had known prior to using more tagging then categories on my site. Everything works pretty flawlessly.  You can browse to your gallery and then click share and share to your wordpress blog. My only problem is that if you post pictures through here and you have a lightbox plugin on your site it doesn't seam to allow the images to lightbox out . I have to repost them.
0545265355|5.0|I purchased The Hunger Games Trilogy on Amazon.  I love to read from hardback books, and these books are new and clean and all in a box.  I placed this box on top of my desk and the books are right at my fingertips, no waiting to buy the next in the series.  I just started reading the first book in the set, so I can't give you a description of the story line, but it is a good read and interesting from the very first chapter.  Amazon, received my order, processed it promptly and I had the book set within days.  For this particular order there was free shipping, which made me even happier.  Amazon you are the best!  Happy Reading.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was yet, another great book by Nicholas<br />Sparks.  I am anxious to see the upcoming movie based on this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome series! I am so glad I bought it as a bundle instead of individually because I couldn't wait to start the next one each time I finished one. :)
B007UXTG8M|3.0|This film got rave reviews, but really, it was quite boring.  I actually fast-forwarded through several scenes once I had a feel for the directing and realized that some of the scenes were insufferably over-long.
1450419895|5.0|Wow. I don't know what I was expecting when I requested this book. I had originally requested it thinking I was just going to hand it over to my boyfriend, let him work with it and then review it from his experiences. (I'm not a strength trainee by any means and abhor gyms with a passion - I go the meditation/yoga route.)<br /><br />But this book is nothing short of awesome. Full colour pages, descriptive workouts (even loads of plans for beginners, all the way up to advanced workouts), photos everywhere and these AWESOME illustrations that show what each type of exercise technique is working on - displaying muscle tissue, bones, impact; honestly, this is a miniature, useful lesson in anatomy.<br /><br />Each workout appraises you of the advantages, disadvantages, risks and provides you with handy safety tips scattered throughout the book.<br /><br />Highly recommended for everyone who goes to the gym or has workout sessions at home...or even just for those of us who are artists (like me) looking for a 'different' type of anatomy book to peruse. It really is an invaluable resource.
B000002J1M|5.0|From the first notes of \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" we are brought into the world of Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Steve Hackett, and Phil Collins. Simply the greatest symphonic progressive rock band ever. \\"Get Em Out By Friday\\" is another classic prog rock song and \\"Time Table\\" and \\"Can-Utility and The Coastliners\\" are both just great great songs. If that was all there was to this CD , it would be 5 stars.<br /><br />Side 2 of the original album is just simply the greatest single thing ever done in the history of rock music. \\"Supper's Ready\\" is a 23 minute epic that will never be topped. Being first at something takes balls and these guys had that in spades. Peter dressing up in outrageous costumes for the stage show just added to the reputation of the group. Just 10 years after this came out Genesis had become a commercial classic rock band and a good one. But in 1973 they were a groundbreaking progressive rock band and there will never be another like them.<br /><br />Foxtrot is a moment in time and \\"Supper's Ready\\" is part of the history of rock music. A forgotten history that's for sure, but it can be accessed at any time through the magic of technology. The music has never sounded better and it is never to late to come to Supper. 5 stars isn't enough for this one.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the things I love about the Wool Omnibus is that I had no idea it existed until just before I started reading it. No anticipation meant no preconceptions or spoilers, so the whole experience has been one the most pleasant surprises I have had in a long time. I will certainly keep following the drama of the silo and it's origins as long as you keep writing about it all Hugh. I'm hooked!
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Bought it for my husband's birthday.  He's a big fan of \\"The Boss\\".  He said it was alright.  But he must have had higher expectations, as he wasn't as pleased as I would have hoped.  Didn't change his opinion of Bruce.  He still pops the disk in whenever he's in the car.

B007B4T90K|5.0|The Good Wife is our favorite show on TV, intelligent & realistic.  A strong antidote to the naive belief that our adversarial criminal justice system is designed to produce justice aand that our electoral process is designed to pick the best people.  A great tutorial on the moral compromises people must make when trying to do good in such a system, and the ones they will make when they just care about coming out on top.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|BORING!  I decided to see what all the hype was about.  It was like watching a very boring and badly made porn flick.  So poorly written and almost bordering on humerous. Weak characters and plot.  I just can't understand the rave reviews. I sure could care less about the other two books and do not care to find out how many orgasms Ana has in her Five Thousand Shades of Grey encounters in this dull trilogy. Sorry,  can I have I have my $9.99 back please?

B0050DIWFC|4.0|The story line was good with a twisting plot.  You're never sure whether Jacob actually did the deed or not.  The ending was definitely a surprise.  I recommended this book.

B001993Y2C|2.0|The Blu-Ray disks themselves are great - the visuals are very good and the sound track is great. The collectible Cylon version of the series is a complete mess from a packaging perspective. The outside box is flimsy and mine arrived with a broken corner (like everybody else). The individual season packaging is a flimsy paper box with a fanfold insert holding the disks themselves. The opening is too tight for my hand to pull out individual disks without sliding out the whole fanfold organizer. When you do that, the disk go everywhere because there is nothing holding them on the sides. Several of the fanfold inserts were coming unglued. I just put all of the disks in paper sleeves and will look for some sort of box to hold them. If it wasn't $115 on a Gold Box special, I would return the whole mess. And to add insult to injure, the Cylon is a cheap 10$ toy and there is no episode list or book or anything else to distinguish this set from the reglar complete series set (which would at least have usable packaging).
B0059XTUVI|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />No matter how good an actor's performance is (and in this case, Meryl Streep's performance is excellent), if the script is weak, the movie as a whole, cannot work. And that's what's happened with 'The Iron Lady'. Director Phyllida Lloyd and Screenwriter Abi Morgan want it both ways. On one hand, they have a great reverence for Margaret Thatcher as a feminist pioneer who became Britian's first female prime minister. On the other hand, being liberals, they've got to be uncomfortable with Thatcher's conservative political stance (to many liberals, in her heyday, Thatcher was viewed as a modern day 'Marie Antoinette').<br /><br />On the surface, Lloyd and Morgan have produced a fairly standard biopic--a hagiography of sorts, touching on Thatcher's storied political career. But I would argue that because of their unease with Thatcher's belief system, they unconsciously attempt to disparage her. Lloyd and Morgan end up focusing on Thatcher in her old age, ravaged by Alzheimer's, and a shell of her former self. Thatcher is now transformed into a tragic figure, and whatever Lloyd and Morgan's underlying intentions, the net effect is to constantly remind us that a woman who once was a firebrand, has now been taken down quite a few pegs.<br /><br />It's one thing to deal with the reality of Thatcher's dementia, but to focus on it, as the main focus of the film, that's a big mistake. Why do we have to be constantly reminded of Thatcher's fall from grace? This could be a story about ANYONE with Alzheimer's! The Weinstein Brothers already covered the subject matter with their 2001 film, 'Iris' starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent (note Broadbent shows up here in virtually the same kind of role--the understanding husband who must cope with a wife in sad decline!) . And yes we know that Alzheimer's is a terrible thing but to knock us over the head scene after scene (with Thatcher experiencing hallucinations of her dead husband), that takes away from the material we're really interested in: Thatcher's rise to power and subsequent political career.<br /><br />Granted, it is a tall order to turn the story of Thatcher's political career into compelling drama; but Abi Morgan is clearly not up to the task. What the script lacks is basic conflict, with a recognizable external arc, culminating in a resolution to the protagonist's dark moment. 'The Iron Lady' works best when Thatcher battles her allies in the Conservative party, but those moments are fleeting. Her opponents are underdeveloped--on for such a short time that the film feels more like a History Channel biography than full fledged drama. Instead, we're treated to archival footage, chronicling the frenzied opposition to Thatcher's policies through the years, as well as realistic (but again, short) scenes in Parliament, where we never get to know any of the Labor opponents as fleshed out characters.<br /><br />Individual scenes do occasionally work. When a bespectacled Harry Lloyd (the young Denis Thatcher) proposes to Alexandra Roach (the young Margaret), the young actors capture the unbridled innocence of the young couple about to embark on their life's journey. The two scenes involving violence also work, which include Thatcher witnessing the assassination of a political mentor and surviving an IRA bombing with her husband, while staying a hotel for a political conference. The Falklands War is covered in the style of a standard biopic but we do learn interesting details as to Thatcher's reaction to the conflict (she writes personal letters to the families of each soldier killed). Finally, there's a powerful scene (albeit somewhat clich&eacute;d), as Thatcher witnesses her husband's death, as he disappears into white light.<br /><br />Despite Streep's bravura performance, one feels that she acts in isolation. Undoubtedly, Thatcher's rise was dependent on a myriad of relationships, which are only touched on briefly here. What's more, thefilm's scenarists avoid taking a stand on many of her controversial policies, preferring to retreat to the generic portrait of Alzheimer's victim.<br /><br />In the end, we find out it was Thatcher's obstinacy that led to her political downfall. She ended up alienating her very own conservative party members, who couldn't stand her lack of flexibility and harsh, demanding work habits.<br /><br />Somewhere, there's a story here but not in the confused recollections of a sad woman, plagued with dementia. The rich tapestry of British political life from 1979 to 1990 is glossed over as we're treated to The Iron Lady's career from the outside in, instead of the inside out.s scenarists avoid taking a stand on many of her controversial policies, preferring to retreat to the generic portrait of Alzheimer's victim.<br /><br />In the end, we find out it was Thatcher's obstinacy that led to her political downfall.

0399159029|5.0|I have read all the Bernie Gunther novels before Prague Fatale and just read this one over the week-end. It's not as good as the original trilogy, but it does not disappoint either. The pace is quick and it explores some of Bernie past during the War as well as his relationship with Heydrich.<br /><br />It's a no brainer for whomever enjoys Bernie Gunther...
0439023513|1.0|Given the popularity of this series I guess I expected more from it.  It became a chore to read somewhere near the end of the second book and didn't improve from there.  In fact the ending is so bad that it may as well have been written by a middle-schooler.  As the popularity increased, the quality of writing decreased, just as happened with JKRowling's books.  Another thing they share is their need to insert senseless and pointless deaths of characters close to the 'star' character.  I shall forever hate this series because the author killed off the most likable character just because she could.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I am a Sci-Fi freak! I read it, watch it and thoroughly enjoy it. I rarely watch a movie or read a book more than once. I have watched this movie 8 times. It simply has the best futuristic graphics and vision of a possible future encounter with an alien race I have ever seen.<br /><br />I won't review the storyline. That has been done a thousand times better that I could retell it. I can only say that movie was creative, entertaining and visually outstanding (Overwhelming may be more like it!). More than 60% of the movie was CGI and the quality made it look real. In a scene where Jake Sully, as the Avatar, is tied up you can even see the lines on his skin where the bindings were in place. No detail was not reviewed and perfectly done. The levels of technology shown in the movie in such graphic perfection are amazing.<br /><br />The movie has grossed over 2.8 billion dollars in sales globally and it is still going up. The standard for the next greatest Sci-Fi movie has been set and it may be that the next winner is the second movie of Avatar. The fact that this movie did not win the Academy Award for best Picture, Best Director Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing was in my opinion a tragedy. The movie that won these awards generated 2 percent of Avatar's USA revenue and far less when compared to a global basis. What did the movie goers who buy tickets see that the Hollywood critics and Academy Award voters didn't see; a better movie! James Cameron didn't get the awards but he cashed in at the bank!<br /><br />If you like Sci-Fi and like good stories then this is a must see movie for you. I highly recommend it!
0312641893|5.0|A sci-fi version of the Cinderella story? You decide. Set over 100 years in the future, Cinder is a slave for her stepmother and two stepsisters. She works as a mechanic, highly respected for her skill and she is a cyborg, being only part human (the cover illustration says it all, and is superb!). The romance between Cinder and Prince Kai is tenative and sweet while the bad guys are really bad, particularly Queen Levana. But Cinder, despite her hardware, is a kick-butt type of girl. A heroine we can all root for!
B006T3RM08|5.0|Other reviewers commented that the trackpad wouldn't click properly when placed in the Clique. My trackpad seems to work fine in the Clique I received, but it did take a couple of tries to get the keyboard and trackpad installed correctly. If you have trouble with your trackpad not clicking properly, pop it out, and try reinserting it. Slide the front edge into the Clique first, and then press the rear edge down. Make sure the trackpad is seated properly at all four corners and it should work for you.

Would recommend this seller, and this set of books.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Margret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) is in the final years of her life. She suffers from dementia and often carries on conversations with her husband who has been dead for 8 years. She has many flashbacks to her younger years when she went to Oxford University and had a desire to go into politics. She was the daughter of a grocer who was also the mayor in the town in which they lived.<br /><br />She had a hard and focused personality but she has declined to the point where she needs constant care, supervision and protection. Her political successes came as she won three elections for Prime Minister of England and the leader of the Conservative Party for over 11 years......<br /><br />This movie has a major asset, the acting of Meryl Streep, who once again proves that she is possibly the best character actor of all time. Beyond her amazing performance this movie suffers for many reasons. Hollywood likes to take pot shots at leaders and this is no different. Margret Thatcher hated Socialism and Communism and fought to keep England a democratic and market driven country thriving on the intellect and inventiveness of its people. In the movie she is vilified (as she was during her career) but unfortunately this movie only seems to focus on vilifying her and illustrating her Alzheimer's and dementia.<br /><br />The most powerful women in political history also had as many admirers as those who hated her policies. She broke the unions and fought the government from printing money just to be more socialistic. The unions wanted a 30% pay increase. England was going into debt and high inflation was rampant. She helped lead them back to stability and financial security. She believed in taking action and fighting for what was right. She wanted to do something to make the world better rather than just trying to be someone.<br /><br />This movie was focused on belittling Margret Thatcher and depicting her as an old lady severely ill and as a bully when she was Prime Minister. Over 50% of the film was focused on her dementia instead of the powerful influence she had on the world. She was one of the leaders who helped stop the cold war with Russia but this topic was hardly even touched!<br /><br />The acting of Meryl Streep was superb but the script and story line was shameful. Hollywood does it again! This movie is not worth seeing for the story but the acting of Streep is the hook that will make you want to see it!of the film was focused on her dementia instead of the powerful influence she had on the world.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I found myself often annoyed with Anastasia. Her personality irritates me. At first, I found Christian to be very, umm... well, dominating, which is apt I guess! I cringed at his smug attitude, and arrogant personality. Later, the story got much better. Once I felt like I \\"knew\\" more about Christian, I liked him much better. The story is full of sex scenes, which eventually became boring to read. The author uses the same wording over and over. (I'm talking verbatim.) Would have been much better if the author had been a bit more creative in describing the scenes, and had used a much broader vocabulary. It became \\"same old, same old\\". (yawn) The story line was good, though, and I had a hard time putting it down.
B005KELW26|5.0|This is my second Kindle Fire cover and so far I love it!  It is not bulky, the straps are unobtrusive and hold the device very securely, and I love love love the magnetic tab.  I store my stylus under the tab when I stow my kindle and it's a good fit.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/5/13: After a year and a half of using this cover exclusively, I'm happy to report it is still in perfect condition. I use my Kindle for several hours most days and there have been no issues with any of the straps or the closure piece stretching or wearing out. Really impressive lifespan.
0345803485|4.0|**Spoiler alert**<br /><br />I had no expectations for this book when I started it.  It was recommended by a friend who told me just a little about the plot.  There are sex scenes (lots), yes many of them involve BDSM (oy vey, get over it!), but they are not what the story is about other than to further our understanding of where the two main characters are coming from or going to. Can a virgin deal with a Dominant like Christian? Yikes! What the hell were they both thinking when they jumped into this?  I had to read on!<br /><br />Really half the sex scenes could have been deleted and the book would have been better. I frankly found many of the sex scenes cold, devoid of emotional feeling, or mechanical, especially in the first part of the book. Some of them were like reading a sex manual.  As Christian realizes his emerging feelings for Ana that does begin to change, but not before he ends up seriously damaging the relationship.  Bad Dom, no cookie!<br /><br />I had some issues with the British English the author uses.  She needs to have American English editors to edit books about American English speakers as I had to look up words that I didn't understand her using in certain contexts.  I know it's nit picky, but I don't want to figure out why something is worded so strange like in chapter 5 when she said \\"He's in gray sweat pants that hang, in that way, off his hips and a gray singlet, which is dark with sweat.\\" What?  An American would never say he was wearing a singlet.  There are others too, but I won't get into those here, just know there are weird British-isms that these \\"Americans\\" use.  In the other books in this trilogy the language is better so maybe she got more competent editors?<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this book for the two main characters' development in the series, not just in this book but in the two that follow.  This book really just sets up the others so read it like it's just an intro.  It's worth plowing through sex scene after sex scene to see how this relationship unfolds. I found myself wanting to know more and more about Christian's tortured, twisted past and how Ana learns to deal with his oh so many issues. I'm a sucker for tortured and twisted characters so I gave this book four stars (minus one for funky editing and redundant sex scenes).
B0052UZIFA|4.0|An old favorite. Recent update fixed it and is now playable on my asus eee transformer. The only thing I miss compared to the iphone version was the &quot;zen garden&quot; feature. If it ever gets implemented, you can expect a 5 star review for sure.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is for the non-prude. It is definitely worth what it is hyped to be. Upon completing Grey, I immediately downloaded the 2nd of the triology wanting to read more!

B000NQRR1Q|4.0|The physical violence in Roman Polanski's THE NINTH GATGE is so campy and melodramatic it reminds me of. . .Hitchcock.  Polanski is far too superb a filmmaker to half bake the scuffles and fisticuffs unintentionally; to me, it looks to be a throwback to the melodramatic silliness that Hitchcock presented in his films of half a century ago.  I kept waiting for flocks of birds to descend and add to the mayhem confronting our protagonist, but I digress.  THE NINTH GATE is a quirky mixture of suspense, thrills, and a tongue-in-cheek nod to the occult; with Johnny Depp in the lead playing a bewildered and harassed book collector realizing his current gig to authenticate a rare book is approaching the metaphysical realm, this is one fun ride.<br /><br />Three copies of a very rare, very old, book--a book allegedly co-written by the Dark Lord himself; book \\"detective\\" Dean Corso (Depp) is hired by an eccentric millionaire (a cheeky Frank Langella) to compare his copy to the other two copies in Europe.  Problem is, people start dying as Corso conducts his investigation--and Corso himself constantly faces deadly peril, only to be saved, again and again, by a nameless femme fatale in need of some shampoo (Emmanuelle Seigner).  Corso is stalked, hounded, assaulted, pursued, and then the copy he's been carrying is stolen.  Corso and his companion in turn pursue the thieves, only to find themselves in a country lair with some serious Beezlebub revelers.  Corso's malevolent employer himself appears at the festivities, retrieves the book, and the true deal with the Devil takes place.  The meaning of THE NINTH GATE is revealed, with Corso experiencing a very close encounter with the dark side.  Depp is eccentric, quirky, dazed, and confused; THE NINTH GATE is a satisfying suspense tale, with a possible tribute to the keystone cops physicality of a bygone era.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|kinda like a farmville. kids would really like it. graphics are well done. neat to play and just pass some time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a fun way to waste time when I'm with my friends or when ever my niece is over. She loves watching me play :)
0756405890|5.0|Let me first say, it's not perfect.  It gets a bit overlong in some places, and some devices are not to my likig (the storyteller saying \\"if this was a story...xyz would happen.  But it's not a story.\\"  Really?  Also, if you are thinking it's a fantasy like Lord of the Rings - it's not.  This is all one day of Kvothe telling his past adventures to Chronicler - there are PLENTY of advntures related but they are not occuring so it's a bit different.<br /><br />All that being said, the book is amazing regardless.  Rothfuss obviously delights in storytelling and it shows as his main char (Kvothe) winds tall tales for us all to devour.  There's something about it that's magical in spite of - or because of - its flaws.  Yes, Kvothe is super-intelligent, gifted, talented, etc - but he has problems too and I felt for him, whether it was in his past or his fresh pain/joys as he relived those moments.<br /><br />I am anxious to read book 2!

0345803485|1.0|All I've heard over the last few weeks was \\"fifty shades\\" this, \\"fifty shades\\" that.... so, without knowing much, I downloaded.<br />Its not a \\"bad\\" book - but NOT worth the hype... have people never read a sexy novel before? They can be really entertaining --- character development, interesting storyline, AND sexy scenarios... this is NOT that type of novel.<br />blech<br />I agree with the other reviews that mention the story line/sex scenes/drama is just continuous & repetitive - NOTHING happens in the book - each chapter is all the same - other then more sex. Sorry, but yawn after the first \\"go-around.\\"<br />I don't mind the characters being rather \\"unbelievable\\" (27year old billionaire, 22yr old virgin who has NEVER done ANYTHING sexual) ~ its fiction, I can handle that - but its just boring.<br /><br />Borrow the book if you can, but dont spend your money - seriously - you get the WHOLE impact of the book in the first 50pages --- a

B004LWZW7E|4.0|Interesting.  I have to say I enjoyed this movie.  Justin Timberlake is always fun (Alpha Dog, Black Snake Moan, Social Network).  I'm happy I saw this movie, and I recommend it.  The concept is weird, the \\"social class war\\" theme is current and smart, the acting, score, and cinematography are right up there with any Hollywood film, and the plot twist and turns are film 101.  I've never quite seen a movie like this before.  They had to create their own new world, which is always a challenge, like \\"Inception\\", \\"Watchmen\\", \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" (not saying this film is anything like those, but it tackles a surreal idea and bases it in our reality).  The film is a love adventure, racing against time, freedom, and death with a \\"Natural Born Killer\\"/\\"True Romance\\" type of \\"love conquers all\\" relationship.  None the less, I feel with a script like this you're always trying to find the holes and I do have to say, the holes are slim and far in between.  Don't put this on the top of your list, but find time to slip this little gem into your movie night soon.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire, by Suzanne Collins is the second in the series, but seems more like the second half of the first book until you get to the last page, then like with the first book, you know there is going to be more to follow.  The beginning of the story reminds of \\"Ender in Exile\\", by Orson Scott Card.  After the great battles the veterans return home, but no one really seems to remember that these deadly fighters are still just children!  And like all survivors of violent arenas, they have their own forms of PTSD.<br />The Hunger games has twisted what would have been just another village love story into something so convoluted that those in the Capital watching think it's something beautiful, but those living it find nothing but sheer torture.<br />Catching fire is about being young and in love and in war.  It's about innocence and ignorance, sacrifice and duty and about how the powerful can twist life until they wring all the joy out of it.<br />This story is about about hunger and that one can be hungry for many things; food, safety, shelter, trust, love, companionship, but the greatest hunger of all is for freedom, because without it all the other hungers can never really be satisfied.  This book blunts the hunger to know a little, but doesn't satisfy the appetite.  There is obviously more to come.  Be aware, this book is very hard to put down.  Don't start it on a week night if you have to be in good form the next day, because you won't get much sleep if you do.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fun for all ages. takes some patience if u don't want to spend real dollars. it'd b nice if some rewards were game dollars.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very similar to Super Mario Bros. Fun, easy to play works great on my kindle fire and Ipod Touch.  great for all ages I'm 30ish and my children 8&amp; 10 love it too.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I liked it. I wouldn't say I loved it because I guess I didn't 'get it' enough.  Eva and Gideon have both been abused in their past.  Eva comes clean about her past and tells Gideon all.  Gideon on the other hand doesn't tell Eva why he has terrible nightmares where he 'acts-out' in the exact way that Eva goes to counseling for.  They seem so in tune with the other that it's hard to understand why Eva has ignored the times Gideon has referenced about his having 'consensual sex'.  Shouldn't that put a red flag up in Eva's mind?  Shouldn't she be questioning why Gideon refers to his relationships in that particular way?  I'd be asking him if he'd had 'non-consensual sex' - if he'd been a victim of rape.    It also seems as if they cannot go more than a day without a falling out.  Mainly; it's Gideon's 'baggage' that seems to mess them up and he's anything but forthcoming about what's 'bugging' his sleep.  Does he know?  In the next book I suppose they'll have their first couple-session with Eva's doctor and I hope the result of the sessions (if they happen - unless Gideon and Eva break-up again...) is that Gideon can open up about what happened to him that caused him so much pain that it affects his sleep in bad ways.    I read that the next book in this series won't be out until October.  Too long.    This book shouldn't be compared to Fifty Shades of Grey....(a series).  They have no similarities other than that of the main male character having some type of dysfunctional problem.  This book (series, actually) is unique.  I just wish it'd been one book and not a series.  Just my opinion.    Thank you dear authoress!  It was a very entertaining novel and reading it left me with a query that won't go away until the next book comes out.    Added June 5 2012: I just noticed that the next book in this series due out October 2 2012 is considerably more $$ for the Kindle version.  It was priced right in this book and now almost double the price?  Why?    Added July 7, 2012: Now they've raised the price of this ebook from the $4.99 I paid up to $7.99.  Greedy publishers?  Glad I got it at a more reasonable price which I felt the book warranted.  Publisher's pricing on ebooks is getting out of hand and that is why so many authors are 'self-publishing'.  I'm thankful for the writer's doing this since the self-publishing keeps the pricing down.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome. it is very addicting. I love it. I have fun playing this game every day. its thebomb
0545265355|5.0|Excellent book...You get sucked into the minute you open the first book.After that you won't be able to put it down, and you can't wait to read the next one. You fall in the love with the whole story and the Characters.
B0043U7XJO|3.0|I watched this via Amazon instant Video on my PS3.  I have a 25mbps Cable internet connection yet the movie was very choppy and laggy.  I paid for the HD version yet was forced to watch the regular version.  Not a big deal.  Maybe just cable internet was bogged down, but Netflix was working just fine at the same time, so not sure what to think.<br /><br />Either way, the movie was a bit slow at times and hard to follow.  It seemed like the movie relied on your prior knowledge of the characters and who they are to really appreciate what the movie was trying to do at times.  My Girlfriend had to explain characters and who they were in order to make it all come together.  I started falling asleep after about 1:45 in, so I can't rate how it finished.  I can tell you that it's nothing like Gladiator as one of the reviews stated. lol
0316123587|5.0|This book is fantastic!  My teenage kids cannot get enough of it, and as a Gleek myself, I admit I love it too!  The yearbook is charming and fun, well-written and entertaining.  Any Glee fan will go nuts over it, because you truly feel like a student at WMHS while you enjoy reading it.  I'm buying this as a graduation gift for every kid I know!

B0076NAWWA|5.0|cd reviews are subjective by nature, so you have to take this, and all CD reviews, with a grain of salt.<br /><br />that being said, i'm a long time fan of Steve Morse and Dave Larue, an aging baby boomer and long time guitar player in his 60's. Purchased this CD because Mr. Morse and Larue were involved; to be honest really never heard of the other musicians.  I knew there would be vocals on the CD, unlike Mr. Morse's solo projects. Got it anyway. Glad I did.<br />I really like this CD,and I think any fan of Steve Morse and/or Dave Larue (no disrespect to the others on this CD, just don't know them) should give this a listen. You might like it. I do.

B003O86FMW|4.0|These books have captured the imagination of both young adults and old ones!  I was reading in the airport and several people asked me what I was reading and when I told them, they were reading it too!  I can't help equating this to the current rage for reality shows that are popular now....I wish we could get rid of them too!
0525478817|4.0|While I wasn't blown away by this one as so many other were, I did really enjoy it. I read it through in three sessions, interrupted only by sleep and classes. I didn't cry which probably makes me a horrible person, especially since I'm a total cry baby, but I was stilled moved by Hazel and Augustus' story. The Fault in Our Stars deals with a very tough, sad subject, but overall it didn't feel sad. There were some very sad parts, hence the expectation to cry, but there's the theme of hope weaved throughout the whole story.<br /><br />I've noticed that all of John Green's main characters seem to be quite pretentious. Hazel is no exception, but I like that. She may be dying of cancer, but she still displays humor, cynicism, brains, and caring. She even falls into some of those stereotypes of how people treat cancer patients, which she hates. I absolutely loved Augustus from the moment we met him! He's hilarious and sweet and just completely loveable.<br /><br />The one thing I did not like about this book was the whole Peter Von Houten plot. He played an important role in the story, but at the end I found his actions very unbelievable and just irritating. I know a lot of the plot couldn't have happened without him, but I still just didn't like it.<br /><br />I'm never really sure how to review Green's books. He's obviously a talented writer, and I do enjoy his books. I just don't know what to say without spoiling anything! The Fault in Our Stars is heartwarming, funny, sad, moving, so many things in one. I'm not familiar with the cancer process, but it felt like a very realistic portrayal with ups and downs.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. lots of little random games. a little addivcting trying to get points to open all the games.

The CD has amazing production. Its not overly engineered and the songs are really great! I think two of my favorites right now are Aquarius and Jane Doe.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is an awesome game! A must play. The only downside is waiting for energy.  but this game cycles fast
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I didn't read the book, and I am almost glad I didn't. I didn't go in with expectations at all. Very touching and redemptive.
0375704027|4.0|I read this book and i will read more of this writers work who seems well versed with not only his own culture but europe as well as he's travelled around and taken in various places and locales. There is nothing i like more than a novel no experience can compare with picking up a novel since it rebounds and echos many of the thoughts and experiences and memories floating from our past and directs our gaze to future experiences and opens them up. So many people like this novel,and it has gained a large readership,and many people the odd person after havbing read it are not that satisfied...but they just dont like the characters. They are more sensualist and realist,and though university educated and bright and thinking there are all kinds of amous writers,and talk of being cool,there sensual overtakes their thinking selves,in all ways everywhere,and thats why i find them unsatisfactory. Yes they are all too familiar...and that may make it a good novel and resonate with many people and it does with me too...but we've all met too many if only the thinking self and the experiencing meet in a more satisfactory way..not a world where women are 'suicides' and men limp on in life...an ode to modernity and fractured lives...and the people we meet are all too like this but i shy away from girls and guys like this...a man whoose wife/spouse commits suicide presents a problem for me 'disposed' of,and perhaps the writer is commenting on life here and modernity...but i will read more of this writer a book i like good writing,sensually depicted....but people lacking a controlling ego to frame experiences more satisfactorally
B000VFGQUC|5.0|Just as I remembered them live. Though they seemed to be playing at a small venue. It was what they did best, play to their fans. I seen Thin Lizzy 5 times with 5 differnt leads from Brian Robertson to Snowy White and the great Gary Moore (RIP). When they broke up it was like losing a friend. When Phil died it was like losing a brother. No better show men, no greater toons. They were the true meaning of Rock & Roll, and this video brought it all back. I smiled from ear to ear, and almost cried to see the final run of such a great band on the extas video. Thank you Thin Lizzy, thank you.<br />Marty Ocha, Lake Geneva, WI
B00005K3NY|5.0|This is another great thriller from the 80's, starring Michael Ironside. I loved this filme because it has that what if this could happen factor. I know a lot of people hate science fiction, but this is a movie that has that creep factor. I think any movie made about individuals who have teleekinetic powers is creepy. I would recommend this movie to any horror fan and especially to all you sci-fi lovers out there. It has that shock factor and it will make you think what if that could happen.<br />THX,<br />Kris L.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games was an amazing book! Once I bought it and started reading it I couldn't stop! I love the romance ad action! I used to be in to the twilight saga.... Not anymore... The hunger games are going to be huge!
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This is an inspiring book full of amazing examples and case studies. This book is life changing for anyone individually or in business.

B0065GC0BA|5.0|What a great book,its a while since i picked up a book that i could not put down, and not many books give me a lump in the throat but this one certainly does, i will be reading some more of this authors books.
0345803485|5.0|This book is a must read. I encourage everyone who loves intense, romantic, and erotic tales to pick up this book. E L James has created characters that are so in depth that will pull you into there world. You will be on the edge of you sit until the end want to find out every detail about each character. I could not ever put this book down, because I fell in love with Christian Grey and wanted him and Ana to work their love story out. Christian is such an erotic and troubled character and he is someone that is messed up, but also someone you cannot get enough of. I assure you this book and the rest of the series is a must read.
0345803485|5.0|While I was hesitant to read a story involving the BDSM topic, I found I was pleasantly surprised by how the subject matter was handled. The passion and complexity of the sex scenes leapt off the page, but made me like the love scenes all the more for their tenderness and simplicity. Ana and Christian are characters I instantly fell in love with and I read the entire trilogy in one weekend. I simply could not put the books down.<br /><br />Christian's mercurical moods and his passion for Ana draw the reader in. You become invested in the outcome and want to see him allow \\"more\\" into his life. Ana's innocence breaks through Christian's shell and opens him to the possibilities of a true relationship of give and take, not just order and obey.<br /><br />I was enchanted and completely smitten by Christian and his \\"fifty shades\\". I was a cheerleader for Ana to help Christian accept more and find love. Best books I've read in a long time!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome! !!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl; love it it is very reciting and fun and useful info love love it needs more buildings tho
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is a fast read.  It took me 5-6 days to read on my Kindle Fire, which is the fastest I've read any book.  That's how interesting it is.  But, I do see some issues that I think parents should know about before letting their kids read this story.<br /><br />Before I start on that, I'm an aspiring writer, and for the most part, don't believe in censorship.  But I do believe in self-censorship, within reason.<br /><br />The author has a unique voice, and writes well (this being the first book I've read from Suzanne Collins, I've read plenty of other authors).  There's no denying she has talent.  However, given this particular story is marketed toward 12 year olds and up (7th grade +), I think certain scenes should have been omitted as inappropriate.  For example, when the protagonist Katniss Everdeen (a 16 year old girl) reaches the Capitol, she is made to strip completely naked in front of two stylist assistants, before Cinna comes to look her over for styling.  Cinna is an of-age male stylist who lives in the Capitol, and requested the, \\"Tributes,\\" as they're called, from District Twelve.  At this point, Katniss is still completely naked, and stripped of excess body hair.  She doesn't cover herself up in front of him, and is not sure if she should.<br /><br />For me, this is a main sticking point.  As prudish as it may seem, I don't think children should be made to stand naked in front of strangers.  Even in a work of fiction.  Life imitates art, exaggerates life.  A story geared essentially for teens may give an impression - regardless how subtle - that this kind of thing is okay to do.<br /><br />I was talking to a friend of mine, who's main concern was not this, but the amount of violence shown throughout this story.  I agree with her that this is excessive.  While death and murder is a part of the real world, society struggles to keep it to a minimum, if not eradicate it altogether.  Showing how 12 - 17 year olds are forced to kill or be killed, for theentertainment of its rulers - and a country which is forced to watch - is something to be questioned.<br /><br />Yes, there are horrors in this story.  I'm not one who is shuns horror stories, as I grew up on stories by Stephen King and Dean R. Koontz.  I've watched the Friday the 13th movies, and other similar movies and shows growing up.  I say this here to tell you that I am not opposed to horror stories.  But this is a different type of horror, and I write this review as an adult.  One who still reads Stephen King and Dean Koontz, as well as various authors (both male & female) across this and similar genres.<br /><br />Would I recommend this story?  To most adults, probably.  To anyone under 18 years old, probably not.  If you pre-read your children's books, consider what I've written here in addition to pre-reading this one.  Ultimately, the choice is yours.
1466311649|1.0|I purchased this item NEW from Amazon. They need to pull the item down. The publisher should have this product recalled. The broken up pixelated images are partially obscured because they literally transferred to print from an ancient computer or telephone facsimile. The material may have been promising but it is absent in this failed printing. How could you allow ANY drawings to misprint. Less than 1/8 of the illustrations printed properly. This is sloppy plate preparation. The images are supposed to be everything! I was shocked. Most of the pages that were supposed to be covered in sketches are literally blank! Page after page is blank with a notation referencing nothing. If you are looking for illustrated examples do not purchase. This was an absolute waste of time and money.
081297381X|3.0|The Black Swan was a good book and I think I agree with most of Taleb's philosophy.  I wanted to like this book more, but the reason I gave it a lower star ranking is because, while I understand most of the concepts, I find it difficult to summarize the main points, or to intelligently discuss it with anyone else.  I would still not hesitate to recommend it to most readers though.<br /><br />The one quote that I took away from the book, which I think best summarizes Taleb's ideas was this:<br /><br />\\"Remember that for an event to be a Black Swan, it does not have to be rare, or just wild; it has to be unexpected, has to lie outside our tunnel of possibilities.\\" (p. 213)<br /><br />Taleb does some delving into the reaction his ideas have sparked (in the included essay \\"On Robustness and Fragility).  Many people - very smart people - think that what he is saying is that a Black Swan is just an unexpected event that blindsides us.  That's partially it, but also important in the definition is that it is the \\"appearance of a highly unlikely event outside the realms of expectations.\\"  \\"Expectations,\\" meaning ones that we set for ourselves.  Taleb takes aim mainly at economists, academics, forecasters and statisticians who think they have come up with reliable means of prediction, but who he feels have neglected forecasting the potential for extreme events.<br /><br />I think it's fair to place The Black Swan in the category of a modern philosophy book, along with the likes of Malcom Gladwell, or the Freakonomics books.  These books all help us to see the hidden world around us, to step outside the tunnel vision of everyday life and to look at the world from a completely fresh perspective.  I found that Freakonomics and Gladwell's books were easier to grasp though, and had stories which were much easier to remember and discuss with people.<br /><br />I'm not taking a swipe at Taleb's writing here.  It was an enjoyable enough read, and he writes in an interesting and oftentimes humorous manner, but I felt like the information provided was a little over my head.  That's not his fault though.  None of the contents were incredibly technical or hard to grasp, but he floats so many ideas and concepts, that you have to hold on to them and compare and contrast them with several other complex philosophies.  There are even parts in the book where he will graciously tell the reader (in a footnote) that if they are a non-technical reader, they can skip to the end of a particular section.<br /><br />The included essay \\"On Robustness and Fragility,\\" was written a couple of years after the book's initial publication.  In it, Taleb discusses some of the reactions to his book, and how his life has changed after its popularity.  He also talks about the 2008 financial crisis and the relevancy of his book (written before the crisis) in regards to the crisis.  The essay was an insightful postscript about the book and the reactions it provoked.

B005CMGKTG|4.0|The vendor I ordered this DVD from was quite prompt in their delivery. I had this DVD roughly a week after ordering.<br /><br />This is an import from Malaysia. The picture was quite good and the sound was great, especially the DTS track. The movie itself could've used a little editing at the end to tighten things up but was otherwise a quite enjoyable film.<br /><br />I do have one problem with this disk. Before the DVD menu popped up my guests and I were forced to sit through nearly ten minutes of previews and various product commercials from Southeast Asia and Australia. On top of that, after setting subtitles and desired audio track on the DVD, it restarted the unskipppable previews. Because of this, I awarded this disk four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is this is a 'movie only' DVD...the only extra is the movie trailer.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I'll be honest.  With new authors, I get very skeptical about how a novel will go. I've read novels by new authors and wondered how they managed to get published.  This is not the case with The Forever Girl at all.  Rebecca definitely worked her magic (pun very intended) in creating such a beautiful and dynamic story about Sophia.  She's a character that you can relate to because the human condition is splayed out all over the page and you worry with her and for her several times throughout Rebecca's telling of her story (with the extra element of the supernatural side of things). My favorite part about this novel though was the fact that I couldn't exactly predict what the outcome would be in the main plot or any of the sub-plots.  And sometimes you don't really want to know the ending before you get there.  It was so refreshing to sit down and get lost in this story and when it changed course I was surprised every time.  I think that it's safe to say that this series will definitely be one that I'm looking forward to reading when other books make their appearance.  Excellent job, Rebecca!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The book seems to cover the entire gamut of habits.  Many apply to myself.  Some are more foreign to me.  I was a little disappointed that those habits that required a more detailed method of avoidance (procrastination - which could be summed up by Nike's sales slogan of \\"Just do it!\\").  That was not very helpful.  I intend to reread the sections dealing with procrastination.  But it will probably be tomorrow or later when I get around to it!
0545265355|5.0|Product was exactly as stated, arrived in great condition!! Can't wait to read!! Thank you very much!! I highly recommend this product

B002ZG994U|4.0|Here is a nice big expensive remake that is oodles of fun. Lots of fist fights, lots of gunfire and LOTS of blowie uppie stuff! It is a great big overblown cartoon brought to super-exaggerated but entertaining life.<br /><br />Plot? Nah. These are the standard war vets framed for something they didn't do, so they have to get out of prison and clear their names. You know the drill... There are so many crosses, double-crosses and flip-flops that I lost track. The dialogue is very funny, the situations are absurd, the characters are easy on the eye and we laugh out loud right on cue. After you get the DVD from Amazon.com, call a friend, buy a six-pack....<br /><br />Here are the players:<br />  * Liam Neeson (\\"Clash of the Titans\\") is the team leader, creative and clever.<br />  * Bradley Cooper (\\"The Hangover\\") is the handsome one, sexy and funny.<br />  * Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson (\\"Never Surrender\\") has a spiritual crisis to overcome.<br />  * Sharlto Copley (\\"District 9\\") plays crazy better than anyone.<br />  * Patrick Wilson (\\"Watchmen\\") is everyone in the CIA named Lynch?<br />  * Jessica Biel (\\"Valentine's Day\\") shares a past with the handsome one.<br />  * Gerald McRaney (lots of TV) is a beloved general.<br /><br />Is the ending ever in doubt? Nope, but you'll sure have a good time!

1568363931|5.0|I found the matching blog (by the same author) before I found the book, but Just Bento has lots of recipes to keep your lunches interesting and colorful AND TASTY. I tend to make almost all of mine the night before, which is not the recommendation in the book, but I find that I like to sleep later in the mornings and waking up to cook just isn't for me. I make/cook the night before, and then heat them up in the morning for the bento box. I often do not reheat the veggies.<br /><br />Great recipes that you can easily make for tasty, homecooked lunches.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|This movie documents an important step toward equality in the U.S. military. It is based on the exploits of an Army Air Corps wing staffed by African American men from the Tuskegee training program. We see what a challenge it was for them to find acceptance by fellow military officers, the frustration they encountered because they were issued equipment discarded by other groups and the pride they developed as a much-decorated and highly honored American squadron that contributed to the Allied victory in WWII. I'm happy to see the DVD is available with Amazon.com.<br /><br />Based on a story by John Ridley (lots of TV) and produced by George Lucas (\\"Star Wars\\"), this well-meaning film has plenty of action and humor, but the weak dialogue by Aaron McGruder (\\"The Boondocks\\") left me shaking my head. Anachronisms abounded: \\"Man up,\\" \\"Get your mojo back,\\" and \\"Stay with me\\" (to a wounded airman), sounded more like 2012, not the 1940s.<br /><br />This cast did a fine job despite the script's many shortcomings:<br />  * Bryan Cranston (\\"Breaking Bad\\") does a quick cameo as a racist officer.<br />  * Cuba Gooding Jr. (\\"The Hit List\\") smokes a pipe here to give his character gravitas. He is a fair-minded officer who wants his men to succeed and understands the importance of morale.<br />  * Terrence Howard (\\"The Brave One\\") is the officer who does battle for his men at headquarters. He negotiates for new fighter planes and meaningful assignments.<br />  * David Oyelowo (\\"The Help\\") brings dash and sex appeal to his character; he's the daredevil who wants to fly that extra sortie and who can spot a beautiful woman from the air. This British-born actor is sensational!<br />  * Daniela Ruah (\\"NCIS: Los Angeles\\") is the lovely Italian woman our eagle-eyed lover boy spots.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I'm a former pilot, so I saw illogical scenes that bothered me, but those same scenes might very well be thrilling to a less picky viewer. This is a war movie, so expect male bonding, blood, plenty of dogfights and LOTS of blowie uppie stuff.<br /><br />Executive producer George Lucas (who personally funded this movie) said in an interview that this project is to celebrate heroes largely forgotten by America, and to offer an opportunity to a galaxy of black actors too often ignored. Kudos!
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay was an amazing close to the Hunger Games Trilogy, and even two months after reading it, I can't stop thinking about it.  I read it in 1 day, which I rarely do with any book.  In my opinion, Mockingjay is, without a doubt, the best book of the series, and is both touching and suspenseful.  It puts you in a sort of limbo where you have no other choice but to keep reading, and yet you don't want to finish it because the series will be over.  Rest assured you will finish it and have trouble resisting the urge to flip back and begin it again.<br /><br />Have a buddy read it with you so that you have someone to talk to, otherwise, you'll go crazy.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Some parents will never learn! Just because Disney/Pixar is associated with a film is NOT license to expect one- to four-year-old toddlers to enjoy this film. Parents of toddlers will have their hands full and will have to give up before it's over. Here are some reasons why:<br />  * Abandonment issues are too complex; tots don't understand why the toys are angry, confused or traumatized.<br />  * They don't understand why Buzz Lightyear speaks Spanish after his reset button is pushed (and they can't read the captions).<br />  * They don't understand how that trash bag mix-up caused such a huge misunderstanding, or what the misunderstanding IS.<br />  * They don't understand how recycling facilities work and might find those scenes scary: the incinerator, the shredders and the magnets.<br /><br />Older children and adults, on the other hand, will relish the lessons in teamwork, loyalty, vanity, resourcefulness, tenacity, and good old-fashioned love. The final scene when our college-bound Andy, voiced again by John Morris (\\"Toy Story 2\\"), has to dispose of his childhood toys is poignant and heart-warming. Pixar can convey so much with a slight intake of breath or a sag of the shoulders as tension eases. In the theater, you could hear grown men sob. Watching your DVD from Amazon.com won't be quite so traumatic.<br /><br />The story is logical, as eleven years have passed since Toy Story 2, and the same terrific voice talents have returned: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, John Ratzenberger, and Don Rickles (among others). New players include Ned Beatty as the misleadingly cornpone huggy bear and Michael Keaton as Ken, who lives in Barbie's Dream House. As Andy, no longer a little boy, prepares for college, the toys are boxed up for the attic. Things go awry and they are sent to a daycare center instead, where the story really gains momentum.<br /><br />What they do about it and why, is the gist of this wonderful story; but do NOT expect a child under seven or eightto enjoy it... Please!
B000LGZHDS|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I am an adult Spongebob fan... call me a dork if you must! One of my favorite characters is Gary the snail, so I thought that this is a must-have for a decoration in my room. I love it - it is soft and durable. I would definitely recommend this to any Spongebob fan!
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I grew up with the Muppets, watched them on TV all the time when I was a kid, but definitely wouldn't say that I have some kind of soft spot in my heart for them.  I reluctantly watched this movie just because my wife insisted on it.  By the time it was over I was saying \\"We are going to have to own this\\".<br />The writers did an incredible job bringing the Muppets into this era.  If this had been a standard Muppet movie, with all of the Muppets being the main cast and centered around another \\"Muppet Caper\\"  it would have been a straight to DVD release.  The writers were very smart to bring the Muppets back by making the story ABOUT bringing the Muppets back.  Another great aspect of this was the balance of nostalgia and new material.  I'd say, off the top of my head, that the music in the movie was split into thirds, one part classic Muppet songs, one part new material and one part popular songs of this era performed by the Muppets.  It was a perfect balance of \\"Oh man, I haven't heard that song in decades\\" (and then not being able to get it out of your head for days) and listening to new songs that give the movie a fresh feel.  It was heartwarming to see the Muppets \\"get back together\\" throughout the course of the story.<br /><br />I will say that it was only my wife and I that watched this, no kids.  I believe she liked it because of the nostalgic aspects and I liked it just because it was damn good writing.  To be able to balance nostalgia, bring an otherwise outdated concept into a modern context and breath some new life into it with original material couldn't have been an easy feat, but these guys did it.  I can't comment on how kids would feel about this movie though.<br />The parallel story of the two humans in the story is pretty basic.  I would have loved to see more out of Amy Adams, I believe her to be a great actress, but it was a Muppet Movie so it's not like there was room for heavy emotional conflict.<br /><br />The one thing about the movie that I didn't like was the main Villain.  I hate to say it, but part of me buys into the whole idea of the evil oil baron being written into the script as a stab at the political right.  I personally don't care, but it was a little out of place to think that an oil rig would have been built on half a block in Hollywood.  There would have been so many more plausible scenarios for that.  I don't believe that it was a conspiracy to brainwash our youth, as some apparently do, but I can't see it as anything other than a conscious political decision.  Still, at the end of the day I think I could watch this movie 5 more times before I even start getting bored with it so I'll keep it at 5 stars.
B004A8ZWWO|1.0|This movie had so much potential to be funny, but it just never really got off the ground. Very disappointed and glad I only paid $1.05 from Redbox.
0898159156|4.0|The Savage Garden by Peter D'Amato is a wonderfully detailed and elegant book; it has both basic and in depth descriptions of various carnivorous plants as well as viable information on keeping and cultivating the exotic flora within, its only flaw is that it only deals with temperature in Fahrenheit, and so as the majority of the world works on Celsius conversion is needed.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|When single mom Taraji P. Henson (\\"Date Night\\") wisely decides to take her fatherless boy, played by Jaden Smith (\\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" 2008) and move from Detroit to Beijing, the little guy is understandably reluctant. We are already familiar with \\"The Karate Kid\\" (1984), so we know where we are going, but Jaden's parents, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have co-produced a winning re-imagining of this upbeat story for their son. You'll enjoy the extras on your DVD from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Their smartest move is to star Jackie Chan (\\"The Spy Next Door\\") as the maintenance man/kung fu master who becomes our young hero's mentor.<br /><br />This is a high-dollar, mainstream movie shot in China, complete with colorful scenes of the 2008 Olympic Village, the Forbidden City in the center of Beijing, and the Great Wall. It is always fun to watch someone master a skill, and this film is no different. We see the boy's frustration at the inscrutable demands of his tutor, his slow mastery of skills, and the maturity and wisdom he finally achieves. And we relish his defiance of the school bully.<br /><br />Of course we can expect the championship martial arts match and all the excitement that promises, but this is a feel-good film all the way. In their son Jaden, Will and Jada Pinkett Smith have produced another winner.

0553573403|1.0|Game of Thrones could have been a fascinating look at the moral grayness of royal politics. It could have been a wonderful epic seen through many different eyes and perspectives. I found myself particularly liking a couple of the characters, so I pushed past the violence-against-children parts as well as I could. I thought that, once Martin had established that both sides had serious moral flaws, he would let up on the most ugly parts of his political and social \\"realism.\\" I was pretty sure that he was going to continue killing off well-liked characters, so I ended up reading with emotional detachment: why get invested in characters that are likely to be brutally killed? Still, I've heard a lot of people talking about the series, so I pushed on. By about page 200, though, it became clear that murdering children and animals is going to be Standard Operating Practice.<br /><br />Are we, as a culture, really so jaded that we need these terrible, graphic depictions of murder and rape to feel we're reading something \\"real?\\" Thanks, Mr. Martin, but there is enough violence in the world without creating this much more for amusement's sake.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana's voice is very unique as I'm sure you can tell. Throughout the whole album she shows off her spectacular range while still adding her signature slurred words that makes the listener hold onto every word. I love the whole album and this is how I would categorize the songs in order from fantastic to great:<br />blue jeans, off to the races, video games, born to die, dark paradise, this is what makes us girls, million dollar man, diet mountain dew, summertime sadness, national anthem, carmen, radio
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|First time watching Game of Thrones,and I was apprehensive,as I always am with anything popular but...wow...Just wow. Engaging & mature story. Deep & intelligent. Intriguing and genuinely likable characters. I was mesmerized,and this is coming from someone pretty much jaded by modern television!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who appreciates dark fantasy.
B0034G4P94|4.0|Here's a review I never dreamed I would write, for three good reasons: 1) I don't like blood sports. 2) I avoid sports clichés. 3) I'm not fond of Nick Nolte. I don't think I would have liked this 2011 movie quite so much if I hadn't watched the extras on the DVD. They provided some insight for a rabid MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) non-fan (ME!), which helped get me past the blood and the pain those folks inflict on one another and try to understand the underlying skills. Sorta like football: Two teams of over-grown hulks pummeling each other into hamburger, but there IS some skill involved, right?<br /><br />Sooooo... Bottom line: 1) I still don't like blood sports. 2) Clichés become clichés because on a very basic level, they work. 3) I still don't like Nick Nolte. But the wrenching final match stayed with me long enough to warrant a review for Amazon.com.<br /><br />We have a pair of brothers. When they were children, one split with Mom when the marriage broke up, the other stayed with the alcoholic father. Neither had an easy time of it. Now, one is a returning Marine vet, the other is a physics teacher with a wife and children. Through a series of clichés, they both end up back in the MME cage, fighting their way toward the championship. By the time they have come this far, we want BOTH of them to win!<br /><br />We have:<br />  * Nick Nolte (\\"Three Fugitives\\") Let's get him out of the way first. He hits all his marks and delivers the goods, I just don't like the goods he delivers. You know, the contrite former alcoholic who is really, really sorry. I agree with his sons: Talk is cheap, but the damage is done. We can't un-ring the bell here, folks!<br />  * Tom Hardy (\\"This Means War\\") is the former Marine. The American accent used by this British-born bloke convinced me he was from Pittsburgh! This war veteran seethes with hostility and rage: perfect for the MMA cage!<br />  * Joel Edgerton (\\"Kinky Boots\\") no trace of Down Under in this guy's American accent either! His character is sweet, a much-loved high-school physics teacher with a loyal wife and two sweet little girls.<br />  * Jennifer Morrison (\\"Star Trek\\" 2009) is that loyal wife. She understands the very real danger her husband is exposed to and does NOT want another ride in an ambulance!<br />  * Frank Grillo (\\"The Grey\\") is a long-time family friend and coach who knows the family dynamics at play here. He has a good reason why Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\" is the entrance music for his fighter.<br /><br />There is a lot of showmanship involved in MMA matches and this movie manages to capture it. Luckily the matches only bookend the REAL issues at stake here and both of the lead actors are skilled enough to capture our attention and our allegiance, to the point that we actually CARE what happens in the cage.<br /><br />It was that last round that got me!
B0000UJDLM|5.0|This movie is so cute and adorable! It appeals to any one of any age and has a great message. It might not be appropriate at times for younger kids, but I think anyone of any age will enjoy it.

B003EYVXXW|4.0|Director Alejandro Amenábar (\\"Abre los ojos\\" and \\"The Sea Inside\\") brings us a sword and sandals melodrama that is based on the life and times of Hypatia, a singular woman who lived in the late 4th century. She was a highly respected philosopher, mathematician and teacher. The 2010 Seattle Film Festival audience, sitting smugly in possession of 20/20 hindsight, smile as she struggles to ascertain if Earth is round, is the universe heliocentric and what the devil is gravity? Her experiments are creative and interesting.<br /><br />We see the brutal persecution of early Christians in Roman Egypt. Then, when the Roman Emperor converts and the Christians prevail, their enthusiastic persecution of the Jews. After the Jews are driven from Alexandria, the Christians quickly turn on the pagans and continue their blood-letting. Religious fervor is NOT pretty!<br /><br />Hypatia, played by Rachel Weisz (\\"The Lovely Bones\\"), is the central character, but her slave Davus, later freed, has the most interesting story arc. As depicted by Max Minghella (\\"Art School Confidential\\"), Davus evolves from callow youth with a crush on his mistress, to smoldering adulthood, still in love with her. Oh yeah...and a pretty good Prefect, as played by Oscar Isaac (Prince John in the latest \\"Robin Hood\\").<br /><br />Of course we might expect lots of Computer Generated Imaging, swordplay, floggings and incinerations (as we already know, the library at Alexandria is burned for containing heresy), plus a few bits of artistic license. In my opinion, Weisz is gorgeous but Minghella steals the show. Get your DVD from Amazon.com and see if you agree.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|Our 5 and 9 year olds really like the game but it allows them to spend real $s on your account without even realizing that they did. In one day they racked up over $65 worth of add-on features. There is no simple setting to prevent purchases. You need to disable the WiFi which can be inconvenient for other users. Until they incorporate an easy setting to disable purchases I recommend you stay away from this one. We will be deleting the game from our Kindle Fire.

0553573403|5.0|This is the first book from G.R.R. Martin that I have read, and without comparing it with other authors, it is serious fantacy with lots of action and drama. The author describes everything well, but personally would like more detailed description on the fighting scenes. This is not a book that I would recommend to young teenagers (like my sons) due to the complexity of the language and the grammar as well as the use of old english words giving the atmosphere a medieval feel.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm a lover of the classics; Jane Austen, Bronte Sisters, Thomas Hardy, Hemingway etc. and romance novelists such as Nora Roberts, Patterson etc. This was genre was completely new to me with regards to BDSM but there was so much more to the story.<br /><br />I was a bit reluctant, at first, to read this trilogy as I am a novice when it comes to BDSM; although, I've read my share of romance novels. A good friend had recommended the book and so I thought to myself, \\"It's on the NY Times bestseller list, I'll give it a go\\".  I was not privy to any other information/background of the book except by word of mouth, which was a bit discreet(probably due to the fact that we were in a a Zumba class at the time and I had no need to sweat more than I already was!). I was left to the Amazon description, my friend's secretive recommendation and one of the most fun reviews from a \\"male senior citizen, a semi-retired gynecologist whose customary literary fare is spy novels and military techno-thrillers\\" which left me laughing and wanting to read this new genre.<br /><br />I downloaded the book last Wednesday, began it on Thursday and couldn't put it down. I was up to the wee hours of the night reading and quickly found myself downloading the 2nd and 3rd book of the trilogy to see what would happen to our protagonist, Anastasia Steele, and the beautiful, sexy, charismatic, charming, billionaire bachelor, Dominant, Christian Grey. I've now read more of this trilogy's history with regards to the author and background of her story and it's relation to the Twilight Series.  I had read the Twilight series before they were popular; this is NO TWILIGHT. As a forty-four year old married woman of three, I found myself feeling like a 20-something and wanting more and more...in so many ways. I learned so much about BDSM, not that it's for everyone but in no way did it make me uncomfortable. On the contrary, I wanted to learn more about this strange world, the couple and how it would come fullcircle. I COULDN'T PUT THE BOOKS DOWN(reading in between carpools to lacrosse practices, school, helping with homework etc)!<br /><br />They say her \\"prose clunky\\", I found it to be twenty-first century and easy to read. James' verbiage was succinct, sexual in nature and equally romantic.  At times, \\"Ana\\" can be quite vexing but Mr. Grey will have you obsessed and possessed with each turn of the page.<br /><br />Have fun and enjoy the pages of the these books.  Keep an open mind and I promise the story line, the characters and the prose won't you let you down. Maybe it'll even spice up your \\"love life\\"...<br />xo<br />P
B000ICZD4I|5.0|I had not seen the movie in years.  Was surprised at how young Kathy Bates looked.  It was like seeing a new movie to me.  My husband had never seen it and he enjoyed it.  I think anyone would enjoy it but that is my opinion. Want to watch it again when I have time and am alone.

B005ZOCFCW|5.0|I've stated it boldly - \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\" being the best by the best. More realistically, it is a close thing among le Carre's body of work. Certainly within the George Smiley Karla-trilogy this is #1 because it sets in motion the arc of a narrative that leads through \\"Honourable Schoolboy\\" and on to \\"Smiley's People.\\" Yet it is fully capable of standing on its own. The latter runs a close #2 in my estimation, but \\"Honourable Schoolboy\\" only is a tad less enthralling because Smiley spends more time off-stage than on. I'm still adjusting to Gary Oldman as the face of Smiley. But on a Kindle it hardly matters. If you haven't indulged yourself before now, dive in. You owe it to yourself. You will be in the hands of a master storyteller who gives your intellect and facility for discernment credit. Your struggle to \\"understand\\" and make sense of the narrative threads are an echo of Smiley's experience. My favorite, read and re-read at least once a decade for more than 30 years since its first publication. It always has been richly rewarding.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is a 1993 film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. The film was directed by Steven Spielberg, and based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS)-officer Amon G&ouml;th, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.<br />The film begins in 1939 with the German-initiated relocation of Polish Jews from surrounding areas to the Krak&oacute;w Ghetto shortly after the beginning of World War II. Meanwhile, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), an ethnic German businessman from Moravia, arrives in the city in hopes of making his fortune as a war profiteer. Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, lavishes bribes upon the Wehrmacht and SS officials in charge of procurement. Sponsored by the military, Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits. Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise, he gains a close collaborator in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), an official of Krakow's Judenrat (Jewish Council) who has contacts with the Jewish business community and the black marketers inside the Ghetto. The Jewish businessmen lend Schindler the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced. Opening the factory, Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his newfound wealth and status as \\"Herr Direktor\\", while Stern handles all the administration. Schindler hires Jewish Poles instead of Catholic Poles because they cost less (the workers themselves get nothing; the wages are paid to the SS). Workers in Schindler's factory are allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed \\"essential\\" to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or being killed. SS-Lieutenant (Untersturmf&uuml;hrer) Amon G&ouml;th (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in Krak&oacute;w to oversee construction of the new P'asz&oacute;w concentration camp. Once the camp is completed, he orders the final liquidation of the ghetto and Operation Reinhard in Krak&oacute;w begins, with hundreds of troops emptying the cramped rooms and arbitrarily murdering anyone who protests or appears uncooperative, elderly or infirm. Schindler, watching the massacre from the hills overlooking the area with his mistress, is profoundly affected. He nevertheless is careful to befriend Goeth and, through Stern's attention to bribery, Schindler continues to enjoy SS support and protection. During this time, Schindler bribes Goeth into allowing him to build a sub-camp for his workers, so that he can keep his factory running smoothly and protect them from being randomly executed. As time passes, Schindler acts on information provided by Stern to try and save as many lives as he can. As the war shifts, Goeth receives orders from Berlin commanding him to exhume and destroy the remains of every Jew murdered in the Krak&oacute;w Ghetto, dismantle P'asz&oacute;w, and ship the remaining Jews--including Schindler's workers--to the Auschwitz concentration camp.<br />At first, Schindler prepares to leave Krak&oacute;w with his fortune. He finds himself unable to do so, however, and prevails upon Goeth to allow him to keep his workers so that he can move them to a factory in his old home of Zwittau-Brinnlitz, in Moravia away from the Final Solution, now fully underway in occupied Poland. Goeth eventually acquiesces, but charges a massive bribe for each worker. Schindler and Stern assemble a list of workers who are to be kept off the trains to Auschwitz.<br /><br />\\"Schindler's List\\" comprises these \\"skilled\\" inmates, and for many of those in P'asz&oacute;w camp, being included means the difference between life and death. Almost all of the people on Schindler's list arrive safely at the new site. The train carrying the Jewish women is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz. The women are taken to what they believe to be the gas chambers; they then weep with joy and immense relief when water falls from the showers. The day after, the women are shown waiting in line for work and being inspected by the camp physician, Dr. Josef Mengele. In the meantime, Schindler rushes immediately to Auschwitz. Intending to rescue all the women, he bribes the camp commander, Rudolf H&ouml;&szlig;, with a cache of diamonds in exchange for releasing the women to Brinnlitz. However, a last minute problem arises just when all the women are boarding the train. Several SS officers attempt to hold back the children and prevent them from leaving. Schindler, however, insists that he needs their hands to polish the narrow insides of artillery shells. As a result, the children are released. Once the women arrive in Zwittau-Brinnlitz, Schindler institutes firm controls on the SS guards assigned to the factory, forbidding them to enter the production areas. He permits and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath. In order to keep his factory workers alive, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shells from other companies, meaning he never actually produces working shells for the seven months his factory is in business. Later, he surprises his wife while she is in the village church during mass, and tells her that she will now be the only woman in his life, a concession he had refused to grant previously. She goes with him to the factory to assist him. He runs out of money just as the Wehrmacht surrenders, ending the war in Europe.<br />As a Nazi Party member and a self-described \\"profiteer of slave labour\\", in 1945, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army. Although the SS guards have been ordered to liquidate the Jews of Brinnlitz, Schindler persuades them to return to their families as men, not murderers. In the aftermath, he packs a car in the night and bids farewell to his workers. They give him a letter explaining he is not a criminal to them, together with a ring secretly made from a worker's gold dental bridge and engraved with a Talmudic quotation, \\"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\\" Schindler is touched but deeply ashamed, feeling he could have done more to save many more lives, such as selling his car, and selling his Golden Party Badge could have saved one more. Weeping, he considers how many more lives he could have saved as he leaves with his wife during the night.<br />The Schindler Jews, having slept outside the factory gates through the night, are awakened by sunlight the next morning. A Soviet dragoon arrives and announces to the Jews that they have been liberated by the Red Army. The Jews walk to a nearby town in search of food.<br />After a few scenes depicting post-war events and locations, such as the execution of Amon Goeth by hanging for war crimes and a brief summary of what eventually happened to Schindler in his later years, the film returns to the Jews walking to the nearby town. As they walk abreast, the black-and-white frame changes to one in color of present-day Schindler Jews at Schindler's grave site in Jerusalem (where he wanted to be interred). The film ends by showing a procession of now-elderly Jews who worked in Schindler's factory, each of whom reverently sets a stone on his grave--a traditional Jewish custom denoting deep gratitude or thanks to the deceased. The actors portraying the major characters walk hand-in-hand with the people they portrayed, placing their stones as they pass. (Ben Kingsley is accompanied by the widow of Itzhak Stern, who died in 1969.) The audience learns that, at the time of the film's release, there were fewer than 4,000 Jews left alive in Poland, but more than 6,000 descendants of the Schindler Jews throughout the world. In the final scene, Liam Neeson (although his face is not visible) places a pair of roses on the grave and stands contemplatively over it.<br />The film concludes with a statement, \\"In memory of the more than six million Jews murdered\\"; the closing credits begin with a view of a road paved with headstones culled from Jewish cemeteries during the war (as depicted in the film), before fading to black.  The impact of the Holocaust was that millions of Jews lost their lives during World War 2 and it is an import story to remember. So that something like this never happens again.  Anti-Semitism caused this to happen and  one important element of the Holocaust was that the Nazi genocidal machine was aimed not only at the destruction of the European Jewish Community, but also at the Jewish seed itself. It was a war not only against the Jews racial existence, but also against the Jewish procreative potential. The very number of individuals imprisoned and murdered in the concentration camp network challenges one's ability to comprehend the enormity of the suffering. The repeated exterminations that had already begun in the ghettos, continued on arrival at the camps and were repeated again and again at every medical inspection. Anyone with any sign of physical disease was eliminated. The suffering and deprivation were enormous. Mortality after liberation from Bergen-Belsen was so great that many of the physically weak died almost immediately after the liberation they had longed for. At war's end, tens of thousands of survivors found themselves in Displaced Persons (DP) Camps, waiting to immigrate to Israel (then called Palestine). These survivors included Jews from Germany, Austria, Italy, and in particular, Poland, where they no longer found a viable Jewish community, and moreover, the Jews who had survived were still the objects of hate and murder by Polish nationalists. The survivors of the Holocaust were condemned to wait many times for long months and sometimes even years until they were able to immigrate to Israel. Their determination to reach that land and rebuild a homeland was a major contribution of the survivors to the eventual independence of Israel and to the renewal of Jewish life in the Jewish State.them, together with a ring secretly made from a worker's gold dental bridge and engraved with a Talmudic quotation, \\"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\\" Schindler is touched but deeply ashamed, feeling he could have done more to save many more lives, such as selling his car, and selling his Golden Party Badge could have saved one more.

B00000AFDW|4.0|I did not hear the songs from this Cd until a few years after it came out and got back into Kiss in the mid 2000s. I was a Kiss fan in the 70s with the orig line-up and then as an impressionable religious child heard about the rumored acronym back then and it threw me off track. Years later I found out it was just a rumor and had no basis in fact and started listening to Kiss again but not only for that reason. In '98 I was still heavily involved in church so back then I was probably more into contemporary Christian music. When I realized that as a Christian I was not under the law per se I started listening to secular music mostly. Anyways, afterwards I started listening to Kiss again at some point. So the natural progression was to listen to the older stuff and then dwelve into the in between years stuff.<br /><br />This brings me to this Cd/album. As a whole I generally like it but still was disappointed when I heard that all four did not play on all of it. Notwithstanding, that is the history of Kiss after the late 70s anyway. After starting to rate these songs individually,I decided to leave the 4 star rating the same overall because of the fact that all did not play on it and rate the songs higher individually for different reasons.  Let me just state for the record that back in their original line-up days, I was a fan of the \\"Catman\\". I wish he had been featured more on this album and Ace also but be that as it may, not a bad album. On to the songs one by one:<br /><br />1.Psycho circus 5/5-The title track is a good rocker with the right hooks and kind of brings back the glory days with the exception of the session musicians instead of the originals on it.<br /><br />2.Within 5/5- A very good Gene song. Not a dud imho.Innovative and creative.<br /><br />3.I pledge allegiance to the state of rock and roll 5/5-the first of the anthem songs on this cd. good one. Paul's best individual performance.<br /><br />4.Into the void 5/5-Because of the fact that all members apparently played on this one, this kicks it up a notch for me. Plus, this is an Ace song also. A cool song and a good one.<br /><br />5.We are one 5/5-I like the chance of pace of this one and generally like it. Kiss acoustic, pretty cool.One that is dedicated to their fans as well as others on this cd.<br /><br />6.You wanted the best 5/5-Cool drums. As I understand it, all members sang on this. ramps it up for me. A good rockin one.<br /><br />7.Raise your glasses 5/5-Rated high for the coolness factor,fun anthem.<br /><br />8.I finally found my way 4/5-good song written for the \\"Catman\\". The weakest song on here but i love it. It is definetly not \\"Beth\\" or \\"Hard luck woman\\" but for the sentimentality factor glad to hear from the \\"Catman\\".<br /><br />9.Dreamin 5/5-The 2nd best Paul performance and pretty cool song. Not bad at all.<br /><br />10.Journey of 1000 years 5/5-God of thunder II. Good one from Mr. Simmons and a good closer.
0553801473|5.0|An awesome book that continues a tale that has been and continues to be inviting and exciting.  This book draws you in to the tale and makes you want to find out what is going to happen next to the continually changing and enthralling cast of characters.  I can't wait to see what happens in the next one.
0545265355|4.0|Received the books quickly which was what my daughter had hoped and she loved them - so satisfying all the way around!
B0026772N8|4.0|This book contains more than enough positive reviews from more eloquent writers than me. Therefore, my brief contribution/warning is regarding the Kindle Edition of this book. I'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as I can.<br /><br />In the forward to the 25th anniversary edition, Pirsig writes that he used sans-serif type to indicate when Phaedrus speaks. He believes that doing so changes the ending significantly. This font distinction is missing from the Kindle edition.<br /><br />I haven't seen the paper edition, so if owners of that could clarify when Phaedrus speaks, that would help tremendously.<br /><br />Otherwise, a great read. My real rating would be 4.5 stars, if half stars existed. The deducted half star is only for the formatting issue detailed above.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It's anawesome game at first. Then comes the glitches that are really irritating. Sometimes it just shuts down when you tap on one of the pioneers with mail. You can't complete two simple planting tasks without the screen changing zoom because something you need to hunt shows up. Then when you've done all your tasks and in the unlikely event you still have any energy left nothing shows up. A couple of times the program glitched while I was in a menu and my energy disappeared. This last time I had 18 and poof!,  all gone. The most irritating glitch is the timers. They reset on their own at times. It started out small at first. An extra 20, 30 minutes. Then a couple of days. Today it glitched and reset everything to 228 hours! Do you know how long 228 hours is? At level 48, I'll tell you how long it is. Long enough for me to lose interest in this game and delete it. When it works it's awesome game, but until they fix the glitches I wouldn't recommend it. It's more frustrating than fun.
1451648537|5.0|This is my first review on Amazon. I felt compelled to write one because this book deserves it.<br /><br />I have always thought Apple products were for sheep who are willing to pay more for the brand. But reading this book and understanding what Steve's vision was for his products, I began to appreciate his painful need for perfection for his products. I will now see every Apple product in a different light (although I will stick with Android). Steve's vision is just amazing.<br /><br />The man himself is hard to deal with. I would've wanted to punch him had I had to work with/for him. But he also had a little bit of humanity in him, especially when it came to the women he loved, and his family. Of course, his love for Apple was greatest. And as much as I hated him, I felt as if I understood the man because I am a perfectionist as well. I understood the way he saw the world (although he saw forwardly, I saw backwardly).<br /><br />I've always loved reading about great men. This book is about one of the greatest.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Awesome game. Worked well on my kindle and was very entertaining. The hint guide was a great addition to the game, too. Definitely worth the money.
0345803485|1.0|This story was crap when it was Twilight fanfiction and it's crap now. Why are people paying for it when all you have to do is search \\"twilight + master of the universe\\" and you can read it for free?<br /><br />There is good fanfiction out there - there's even great fanfiction. This is neither. Wake up, people.
0345803485|3.0|This book, which I read in two nights, is not what I would call a love story, rather it is pure erotica but written from a more emotional and romantic female-in-charge point of view playing a submissive role so the degradation aspect loses that usual in-your-face pornographic negativity. The plot is crappy, the prose and dialogue wanting and the whole content is in dire need of a proper forensic proof and copy edit. However the characterisation work is quite good, a strength of the author's writing and it has some pace about it but in the end it's just pure escapism and fantasy, what I would call porn with a better story, although I seriously disliked both main protagonists. But I suppose there is nothing wrong with that if it nets you a million in a few months with a film deal in tow. Congratulations to E L James for catching the sudden viral and digitally driven zeitgeist of non-paranormal erotica, but there are a lot of better written books out there in this genre vein, which you can also read on the train, on your Kindle without anyone knowing.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|This  is better than the default browser: runs as fast, has better viewing, same but asier to use functions, better streaming, and responsivenss. Best alternative browser ive used too!

B004SRNH10|4.0|Download it if another app you have says you &quot;need adobe air to run&quot; the app. Otherwise its just an unneeded waste of space. It is JUST to help run some apps, it doesnt do anything else.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I thought it was very entertaining, but I really wish it were longer. Very addicting game, but will be completed in a few hours. Maybe less.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book!!!  It was so sexy and it made me giddy and smiley through the whole read...I just downloaded the next two and can't wait to see what's next.<br />It's not the best written book, but I think that's what I loved about it.  It was like a friend telling me a steamy story, yeah, a REAL steamy story.<br />Now go buy this book!!!
B003YL4KS0|5.0|The book was an easy read, I finished it within less than a couple hours and I'm SO happy I decided to purchase it!<br />I've shared it with so many other friends already who all also love the outcome of their curls. :) Would definitely recommend it to anyone who's in need of a little guidance with their hair
0785814531|5.0|It's thick, like an encyclopedia, but it contains many stories.<br /><br />It starts of with a pretty good introduction that describes Edgar Allen Poe in a analytical and entertaining manner. It talks about his life, love, and sanity, among other things.<br /><br />Then there are 73 stories to read including Poe's greatest stories like \\"The Tell-tale Heat,\\" \\"A Descent into the Maelstrom,\\" \\"A Black Cat,\\" \\"The Cask of Amontillado,\\" \\"The Pit and the Pendulum,\\" \\"The Masque of the Red Death,\\" \\"The Fall of the House of Usher,\\" and \\"The Gold-bug.\\" Unfortunately, the book also contains some of his most mundane and boring tales, but if you want to go deep into the mind of the Author this is the book for you.<br /><br />Now if 73 stories weren't enough, the book also comes with 49 poems, which includes \\"The Raven\\" of course.<br /><br />With this much material you can guarantee that you will have something to read for a many nights.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Started out as a great and entertaining game.  Now the glitch of the super long 300 hour clock and no energy has hit. Hope it is fixed soon so I can continue to play.

0553582038|5.0|The entire novel of A Song of Ice and Fire is awesome, and if you've read this far, might as well get the book and see how the story continues. You won't be disappointed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i downloaded this game for my kindle. this is a great game and is flexible to however you want to play!
0439023521|5.0|I got this book after all of my friends raved about it and insisted I read it before seeing the movie.  I am so glad I took their advice!  The author writes with enough detail to engage the imagination, but does not get bogged down in excessive details and descriptions.  I stayed up very late to read it, but didn't mind the \\"Hunger Games Hangover\\" the next day at all!
B005I4JG80|5.0|I am a Mom of 4 kiddos aged 2-12.  I have read several parenting books and was an elementary teacher for 14 years.  All that under my belt and this book still gave me some great ideas to try!  It was a very enjoyable read with funny moments that any mom could relate to.  I liked the style, sharing anecdotes and frank discussions that she had with friends.  Some parenting books can feel preachy, but this one not at all.  I have already put several ideas in to practice with much success.<br />I also like the meal/eating guidelines.  I have started to serve the fruit or vegetable \\"course\\" first with great success and think that following the 3 meals and one treat will help me lose the last of my baby weight.  I would recommend this to any Mom, new or veteran, it is a great book and sometimes it's just nice to hear you are not in the trenches by yourself!
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|Have both movies and enjoy watching them. To me they are a more realistic Sci Fi series. Like the characters.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|kind of boring but great graphics. I wish it was a little more interactive. the sound is so so.  but it is good for a free app. it is better than some I have paid for.
1594203334|4.0|Bringing Up Bebe is an interesting book for several reasons.  One, it's a cross between an autobiography and a parenting book--meaning that it's chock full of the author's own personal experiences of trying to be an American mom to three young kids in Paris.  But the author mixes plenty of parenting research, interviews, and advice in with her experiences, which gives this the flavor of a parenting or self help book as well.  But the book never went to far in one direction for me, which made it interesting to read while being informative.<br /><br />There are certainly big differences between French and American parenting styles, but I think for most this book will be interesting, and a way to introduce new ideas into your parenting style.  Particularly interesting to me was the idea that a child is part of the family but not the focus of the family, and that adults need their own adult time, even when they have very young children.  I certainly think these are things I would one day like to work into my own parenting philosophy.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have found this. app to be fairly accurate. it also looks really nice and easy to read. I would recommend
0345803485|5.0|I am 2/3 of the way finished with this book and just ordered the next two. This book is amazing, there are many parts that make me go 'Ewe...Oh!....Hmmmnnn....That's hot.' It has put the spark back into my own life. I'm loving every minute of it. My only worry is when the series is over.
0385738773|4.0|********This review contains spoilers!******<br /><br />First, I loved the book, but not as much as the first two. The first two really kept me guessing as to whether WICKED was really good or evil. The third one felt a little rushed, but I loved the ending!<br /><br />****Spoilers****<br /><br />I knew Right Arm wouldn't be as righteous as they claimed they were. Vince should have waited to set off the bombs, I am thinking he had more up his sleeve than stopping WICKED just as Thomas' hinted.<br /><br />What I got from the ending was this:<br />Chancellor Paige planted Jorge and Brenda to help Thomas rescue as many Immunes as possible to repopulate the earth.<br />AND... the solar flares were a means of population control that the original founders of WICKED created. The new WICKED was trying to make amends, that is why Paige insisted WICKED is good.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Well I did some research prior to buying this CD. So I was not surprised with the outcome. However, some may be surprised that an over 30 y.o. male would actually appreciate the music of some young UK boyband. However, this CD just has a vibe of good times. Hence, it makes sense that they named it \\"Up All Night\\". The stand out songs are of course, the break out hits include \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\", and \\"One Thing\\". However, the CD has more for the buck than that. The upbeat song \\"Tell Me a Lie\\" should definitely be a single too. However, they also have great flow and for me I believe two other songs from the CD could be singles too. They include \\"Taken\\" and \\"Same Mistakes\\" which were co-written by the five lads. I am big on if a group can write, so their future looks promising. However, I was disappointed that they only offered I think their best song \\"Moments\\" on a MP3 download. Overall, this is a great start for a bad that could have put out a mediocre CD, but they put out an epic one. May many others gets OneDirection infections. Kudos to the band individually too which consists of Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Zayn Malik, Luis Tomlinson and Niall Horan. My only request is that Niall and Luis can get more solos so that are five can sing on all the songs. That would make the band much different than all the other boy bands in the past.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is one of my most used apps, I love it! it is so cool how it reads the verses in an actual voice, not a computer

B004EPYZPS|4.0|While Super 8 is reminiscent of Spielberg's past films, and pays homage to the big 70s or 80s sci-fi hits, it still is a film that stands on its own.  The film's main characters are developed for the most part, and the coming of age theme fits in nicely with the story. The action and sci-fi elements are there, yes, but they don't take precedent over the characters and the spirit of the film.  As others have stated, Super 8 does have a Stand by Me/ Goonies kind of vibe to it, with a bit of teenage crush thrown in.<br /><br />A group of kids in a rural Ohio town witness a horrific train wreck while they are out filming a scene for a film contest.  One of the boys, Joe, however, notices that a car had also been in on the disaster. The driver of the vehicle, who is badly hurt, has puzzling and ominous warning to the startled children. This message has more meaning as odd supernatural events begin to take place in the area. The military comes in, but there is the sense that all is not right in the small town. Joe's father, Police Chief, begins to look for answers to the odd happenings.<br /><br />One of the things I liked leading up to this film's opening last year was that the trailers held back on revealing major spoilers, which was kind of refreshing in a day and age when we are given too much during previews. The producers take this a step further by showing the \\"creature\\" minimally, the \\"less is more\\" approach adding more suspense the plot.<br /><br />If there is one weakness of Super 8, it is that the ending was a little weak. It got a bit over the top, and sort of felt a bit jumbled, like the film lost steam as it headed to the finish.<br /><br />Still, Super 8 has that summer blockbuster feel to it that makes it a treat to watch. There are also some standout performances by Elle Fanning (Alice) and Joel Courtney (Joe).<br /><br />Super 8 is definitely one to check out.
B003T0G9Y4|2.0|Once again our heroine Becky  spends too much, lies to cover it up, gets in trouble and miraculously is bailed out with absolutely no consequence to herself.  And is in fact rewarded at the end of the book.  Umm hasn't this been done... a few times?  I'm not the only one that thinks this is no longer cute.  (Isn't it time for the characters to grow up a little?)  And then there's the child.  Does anyone who has read the book wonder if perhaps Ms Kinsella had a stroppy (albeit slightly ridiculous) two year old at the time of writing this book.<br />I wish I'd believed the other reviews because I wouldn't have wasted my money on this.  Please don't waste yours.
1612130283|5.0|This is a fantastic book. The author is such a great writer with a great imagination. She just pulls you into the book. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put the book down, nor did I want to. I was so engrossed in the character that I wanted to be \\"Anatasia\\" and wanted to be with the sexy Christian Grey. I couldn't get his image out of my head of what he looked like and what he sounded like. I hear there is some negative thoughts regarding this book, and that some do not like it. Well, my feeling is then don't buy the book. This book is about imagination, erotic fantasies and having an open mind. I found myself very aroused and couldn't wait to be with my husband. It made me want to have more sex and bring our sex life more alive. This is not a book I would recommend to teenage girls, but for the older woman. Great story, great read and I for one cannot wait to read the 2nd book in this trilogy. Thumbs up to the author. Keep on writing! - Laurie NY
0061124958|5.0|In the book Charlotte's Web, a pig is born a runt.  A girl named Fern begs her father not to kill the little pig.  Her father agrees and lets her raise it.  She names him Wilbur.  Once Wilbur is bigger he moves to Mr. Zuckerman's barn where Fern sometimes visits him.  Wilbur is lonely in the new barn until Charlotte, a friendly spider, introduces herself.  They become true friends.  When an old sheep tells Wilbur the farmer is going to butcher him, Charlotte promises to save Wilbur.  Can Charlotte keep her promise or will Wilbur become Christmas dinner?<br /><br />The characters in this book are fun to read about.  Each animal has its own unique personality.  Templeton, the rat, is greedy, and grumpy.  The geese are funny and they love to repeat themselves.  The old sheep is very wise.  Charlotte is good at making speeches and kind-hearted.  And Wilbur is humble and emotional.  But the book isn't just about the animals, it's about Fern and the other children too.  All of the characters are interesting to read about.<br /><br />This book was perfect for reading while I was studying cycles in school because it has so many different cycles in it.  The seasons are described with lots of detail and the characters progress through different stages of their lifecyles throughout the book.  I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to children who like animals or are studying cycles.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|although it says you need to buy some stuff with real money you don't have to wait that long at all to gain the coins. plus this game has awesome feautures like being able to watch clips of ice age while playing the game. totally worth the download!

B0055Q5F36|5.0|I figured I had to rate it another 5 to bring the rating up for the amount of people who were rating it zero... after reading all their reviews, I almost feel sad for these people who bought obviously, the WRONG case, for their phones. this case is for the international version (i9100). if you have that phone, this case fits great. the screen protector included is great too. if you use the swype keyboard you don't want a sticky screen protector like the invisishield one.
B00753MBHA|5.0|Once again, Accept shows the world how it's done! Nothing really to add to the other reviews here except for one important thing - I think the song order could have been better.<br /><br />The album \\"flows\\" much better if you put the songs in this order:<br /><br />The Quick And The Dead<br />Against The World<br />Stalingrad<br />Flash To Bang Time<br />Hellfire<br />Shadow Soldiers<br />Twist Of Fate<br />Never Forget (Bonus track)<br />The Galley<br />Revolution<br />Hung, Drawn, and Quartered<br /><br />By putting the songs in this order the album itself sounds much more cohesive, even, and complete.<br /><br />The way \\"Hung Drawn and Quartered\\" is structured as a song (the intro sounds like a grand finale) it is definitely a closer...not an opener.<br /><br />And remember....\\"There's two kinds of people - the quick and the dead!!\\"<br /><br />Rock/metal album of the year

B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie Raitt's new CD pops & sparkles with a string of tasty tracks.  The CD starts with an electrified new Randall Bramblett song \\"I Used to Rule the World.\\"  The second track is Gerry Rafferty's \\"Right Down the Line\\" with Luis Conte on percussion and Ricky Fataar on drums creating a bubbling bounce over which Bonnie's great guitar and her aching vocals throb, \\"'Cause you believed in me through my darkest night, put somethin' inside of me, You brought me into the light.\\"  Loudon Wainwright III & Joe Henry's \\"You Can't Fail Me Now\\" is a slow smoking blues, \\"I bit off more than I can chew; It's something that I tend to do when fewer words are what we need and how.\\"  \\"Down to You\\" rocks the house with a great shuffle, \\"Step out on the track in the pouring rain and when you get run over, well, you blame the train.\\"  Currently #1 in my personal top ten rotation, \\"Take My Love With You\\" smolders with a sexy seductive beat & an upbeat lyric, \\"I'll be your talisman; I'll be your lucky charm; Put it in your pocket; Put it in your heart.\\"  It's SO good I can't stop listening!  \\"Not Cause I Wanted To\\" is a tear-in-your-beer weeper for every blue heart in the local universe.  \\"Split Decision\\" is another stunning rocker with smashing electric lead guitar and Ricky Fataar's drums unleashed.  \\"Slipstream\\" is so strong it will undoubtedly be on many \\"best of's\\" lists for 2012!  Enjoy!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game to just chill with wish it had more videos with it. Also I like that it is not asking for money to be able to play.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games held my interest from the first paragraph of the first book.  I enjoyed the characters and how the author maintained their integrity throughout.  Vivid descriptive writing.  More than enjoyable and much better than the Twilight series!
0439023513|5.0|The parallel to the impact of real wars is perfect.  There really are no winners, are there?  People scarred for life...memories of those lost...simply picking up the pieces and moving on as a fragment of one's self.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|I am a huge Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake fan, but even they could not prevent this movie from being an epic fail. This movie is just awful. I tried to figure out why, as I was watching it -- and there was time to mull this over, as I was completely unengaged in the stupid story -- and I came to the conclusion that it's not the actors' fault at all. It's a repugnant story to begin with, and an unfunny, soulless, pointless script.<br /><br />Think \\"School of Rock\\" without a shred of wit or charm. Think \\"Stand and Deliver\\" (the movie this teacher shows in class day after day as she sleeps off last night's binge) without any drama, heart or morality. Cameron Diaz plays a hugely unlikable witch with a B, who hates everybody and everything, including kids. She's borderline abusive in her teaching duties. Of course all the good and decent people, you know, the good teachers, who enjoy their careers and love kids, they are of course made out to be morons.<br /><br />So the main character is detestable, and her behavior as a teacher is unbelievable. What teacher sits in the car in the parking lot and gets loaded, even having a conversation with a student while hitting the pipe, and is allowed to just keep working as a teacher? She sits at her desk and ignores the kids, swears at them, mocks them, throws things at them...and these are young, middle-school-age kids. It is ridiculous, unbelievable, and disturbing, but on top of that, the movie commits the worst sin for a comedy: IT'S. NOT. FUNNY. I don't think I even smiled in in the hour and 15 minutes I gave this dreck before turning it off.<br /><br />Recommendation: Oh good grief, no. If some night you have a choice between watching \\"Bad Teacher\\" or staring at a blank wall, choose the wall.
B006Y5BWQG|5.0|I find myself waiting anxiously for each new episode! The music is fabulous! The characters are fabulous! I absolutely love it!
0553582038|2.0|I agree with many others reviewing this book, and the series as a whole. I was really into the series with the first two books, though I was very angry about the Red Wedding (was the book 2 or 3?) and the knocking out of Robb and Catlyn from the game of thrones. They were wonderful characters that deserved more ink. By the third book I was getting bored with the plot, which seems to have gone very far astray, as has many of the characters, and began to wonder why the author was introducing so many minor characters that add nothing to the original story. Speaking of too many characters, and the lost plot, killing off interesting characters and not speaking of some others only left me wondering what was the point of book 4? I'm almost at the end and feel cheated. I will not bother continuing on. Mr. Martin, I just don't care anymore.
B00785P2QC|3.0|this game is that bad just like virtual city but not at different levels....same place its Mindanao like cityville on facebook
B007PTJOV0|4.0|It's nice but a lot like Mario. Otherwise it's very addicting and fun to play. I would recommend it for people who are big Mario fans.
0547258305|5.0|Couldn't put it down- hard to find a novel that captures you completely and Graceling was addictive! Absolutely loved it- great writing and character development to die for. Read this if you love a literary adventure!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I purchased AS5 in hopes of avoiding yet another motherboard replacement in my laptop (XPS M1530). I have seen temps decrease on my CPU and GPU by up to 10 deg C, and even when the computer is not my laptop cooler, I only hear the fans after very extended use or while streaming media or playing a DVD. Great stuff if you take your time while applying it. Would definitely recommend!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I am a fan of all the angry birds games but space is really awesome.  Lot's of fun and I get to explain gravity to my kids with it!
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Legend has it that a reporter once asked JFK what he did for relaxation, to which he responded that he enjoyed Ian Fleming's spy novels. Just in time for Hollywood to launch the James Bond craze. Eleven novels and several movies later, in 1967, along came The Spy Who Came In From the Cold by John LeCarre. A decidely grim anti-Bond novel.<br /><br />Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, came along in the 1970's. It was a classic spy novel. Intricate and based on real events. The Kim Philby scandal had caused harm to the UK and US. Philby, a second generation British spy, didn't defect until 1963, leaving a trail that went back to WW II. He died in 1988.<br /><br />The six part TV series starring Alec Guiness was a great success in 1979. The Cold War was raging and the novel and series were far more sophisticated than most spy fare.<br /><br />It is rare for a classic to follow a classic, but this version, in just two hours pulls it off. No scene is wasted, dialogue is brilliant, the party scenes are genius. Notice the songs. Sammy Davis Jr. followed by Julio Inglesias? Spies left in the cold at the end? Brilliant.
B005Q1W10A|3.0|Ordered this DVD and had to exchange it because of audio issues. The replacement had the same audio problems. Amazon should recall this lot of DVDs.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty good overall but some of the games are not that good. then all of the others are really good.
B005HET488|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this episode! TNG gets better and better as the seasons progress!<br />The Romulans are a very well thought foe, and this episode shows their more human side.<br />A classic!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was fantastic!!! No words can describe the beauty of this story! From the first chapter to the last you feel every situation and the poetry moved me to tears! Colleen is brilliant! You owe it to yourself to read this book!

B000H6SXMY|5.0|My older daughter loved this show. So for her birthday got the whole series. She love's it. Watches it all the time!
0375869026|5.0|Back before this book was released, everyone at my job got an ARC (That's Advanced Reader Copy, something publishers send out to book stores so that  buyers and book sellers can get an early look at upcoming titles and see which ones they like best. That way we can tell everyone who comes and visits our stores about new and exciting titles). The box was HUGE - more than enough to go around, but when I picked this one up I was told that I had to bring it back IMMEDIATELY after finishing it which I knew could only mean one thing - competition had gotten so fierce for possession of the copies that upper management was trying to prevent fights over who got copies. It's only happened a few times before over the best books, so I knew from the beginning that Wonder would be something special.<br /><br />Wonder is a book so wonderful, so amazing in general, that I wish I could box up copies of it and send it all over the world for people to read. This is a book for kids that manages to deal with a tricky and often very painful subject in a matter of fact tone that never shies away or seeks easy answers. The struggles these characters go through feel very real without being overly saccharine or smarmy. Each character's story reveals and ends its self in a way that feels very satisfying and pleasurable to read.<br /><br />My biggest fear going into Wonder was that the book would be overly depressing, dark, and would leave me feeling either so choked up with anger I couldn't speak, or rolling my eyes. Thankfully neither is true. While I did cry at the end, it was the type of crying that is caused more by pure joy and gratitude than any kind of sadness or despair. Wonder is the type of book that not only leaves you with a set of well written instructions on making life better for both yourself and those you love, but also with a deep feeling of thankfulness for having some into contact with something to gentle and uplifting.<br /><br />A true marvel of children's story telling - if this one doesn't end up eating up awards left and right when the time comes, then I don't know what's what.- if this one doesn't end up eating up awards left and right when the time comes, then I don't know what's what.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I've finished Game of Thrones and bought the Blu-ray series.  A pure joy both reading and watching.  I'm midway through A Clash of Kings and will order the fifth book which I think is titled Dance of Dragons.  As long as Mr. Martin keeps writing, I'll keep reading.
B006BQI1V2|4.0|This movie is different from the book. I enjoyed the book so much more but the movie is done well.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|the game has has graphics and it doesn't make sense at all.  some parts are cool but overall this is a waste of time. this game bites and don't get it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These three books were amazing. Very hard to put down. I would definitely recommend this trilogy. Read the books before seeing the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great book, I couldn't put it down.  Was always wondering what was going to happen next.  Have started on the second book now just to find out what continues to happen.
0811875040|5.0|I wanted to put my 2 cents in because I think this book having errors in its first edition has hurt its reception. Personally, this is my favorite baking book I own, and I have read it cover to cover. I purchased this book after the errors were fixed and have made quite a few of the recipes, specifically:<br /><br />- Hot Milk Cake<br />- Lemon Debutante Cake<br />- Double Chocolate Cake<br />- Tomboy Cake<br />- Cheesecake<br />- Gingerbread<br />- Chocolate Wafer Cookies<br />- Crème Fraîche Scones<br />- Vanilla, Raspberry, & Lemon Buttercreams<br />- Cream Cheese Frosting<br />- Lemon Curd<br />- Simple Syrup<br /><br />They've all turned out fantastic - particularly the stout beer and cardamom laced Gingerbread which I can't get enough of. The recipes are easy to scale. Most of them I've cut in half (because the base cake recipes yield 2 cakes) with no problem. It's a book for people that are passionate about baking and like to take their time in the kitchen. The results are worth the extra effort. The Double Chocolate Cake stays moist (even after being frozen) and is now my go-to recipe for chocolate cake. I've been to their shop in Hayes Valley and it's one of my favorite bakeries in SF. The book is equally charming.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|ok this game is a little bit of a game where u really aint got to do any thing it would be better if they had energy and how the heck are u spose to finish this one.mission i mean it says visit 2 neighbors and ive done it so many dang times boo im sorry if i hurt ur feelings people who made this game but u need to add energy and longer time to it so it will go longer please take my advice not saying its bad or anything but please do this
0470876417|5.0|The approach of this book for the business model is unique and well presented. I appreciate the non-linear approach. Business is not a linear world and this book presents tools that reinforce the real world of business.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You either love or hate the book!<br />I have to say that I love it. BDSM aside, I love how the relationship between Christian and Anastasia developed. Yes, there is a lot of sex in the book and they can be a \\"little\\" rough, but I think that they were done well.<br />I can only say that before criticizing the book, you first have to read it.<br />I really hope that E L James does something else with the story.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This is perfect for Kindle Fire.The corner anchors are very snug and may be a challenge to secure,but they are strong.<br />This my second cover by Marware, the first has protected my Kindle DX for several years. The bookstand feature allows you to sit in your desktop.<br />I reccomend this product highly and hoped your're enjoying your E-books.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|would be a very fun game except it will not let me add friends and when I try to go visit other villages it tell me I need to update and restart.  I cant get past certain quests because of these issues. fix the problems and id give it a better review.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I enjoyed the book and read it in a couple of days.  It's the type of book that you always are wanting to know what happens next.  Yes, it does have some plot twists that aren't too hard to figure out and the story is a little disjointed in the two plots going at once, but overall, it's a good read and well worth the time.  I believe we'll see his main character, Assassin Will Robie in future books.  It would be a crime to waste all of that character devlopment, etc. for only one book.
1610660242|1.0|I did not intend to order the (comic book ) version of this book.  Disapointed when it came. It was not clear that I was getting a comic version.
B006DDO1D0|5.0|I am on my third \\"listening\\" of this book.  The reader is incredible.  The main character is \\"all of us\\".  As much as I have loved Stephen King over the years, his recent books have left me unhappy and dissatisfied.  This one has the depth and ending that will make one satisfied...and still with a bit of wonder. As in The Dark Tower (and other novels), we are in Stephen King's world.  We see characters who we have previously met.  We are alerted to \\"19\\".  We go back to a world which we have been in and enjoyed.  I loved it!  Hopefully, eventually, I will move on to other audio books I have purchased, but right now I just \\"keep listening\\" AGAIN! I can't seem to leave.  Maybe I need to go back to the Dark Tower just to \\"leave for a bit.\\" Even my sister-in-law, who would never read Stephen King was entralled.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|The problem that I have with this and other Gameloft games is they expect you to use REAL money to purchase materials in a GAME! I don't even see why anyone would bother to do so! Without using real cash, the game not only takes too long and,therefore some \\"tasks\\" can not get completed, but after I got to the 3rd level, it crashed my Kindle Fire...twice! When I rebooted the game, businesses which previously took 1 hour to provide cash, now took 147 hours! I didn't wait that long, but when money didn't appear after 24 hours, I removed the game and reinstalled it, only for the same thing to happen. The game looks great, and could be greatly enjoyable, but in order to play the game without the frustration of continually waiting to energize, replant, rebuild, whatever, you would probably wind up paying desktop computer game prices or $40 & up, for an app that's free, so it kind of negates the purpose of an app in the first place!
0307888908|5.0|I would recommend this book to just about anyone. My goal was to learn more about using social media for networking. I learned some things in that space but this book is more broad. It focuses on networking building generally, with social media being a channel. It also challenges readers to continually network and to do it in an intelligent fashion. Whereas other books cover a similar topic, this book has \\"street cred\\" due to Mr. Hoffman's background. This includes his involvement in PayPal, starting LinkedIn and in VC investing.<br /><br />His book also has a heavy emphasis on various sociology studies. So it's not just some informal stories that the author experienced in his career. It's backed up by research. The case studies described throughout the book are about people and companies that we've all heard of. It makes it very inspirational to learn about the persistence that so many successful people had in building their start-ups. Finally, this book was written with great heart and passion. I appreciate the authors taking the time to write it.
B002RKRV4Y|4.0|I read this book last week on my Kindle app.  Interesting book.  Makes you think a lot about the meaning and purpose of life.  Not quite sure what to believe and what not to believe.  I guess one thing I took from this book was that my life journey will be by own.  I will have to make my own mistakes to learn from them.  Not sure if this is what book referred to.  Recommend folks to read for themselves and draw their own conclusions.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I don't know too much about Victoria, as this time period is out of my knowledge. So, I cannot comment on accuracy. However, this is a very visually beautiful movie. If you are like me and want to see scrumptious clothing and beautiful people in panoramic scenery, then you will enjoy this movie! This is a nice piece of cake.
B00656C6KK|5.0|Come on, how can you go wrong with Doris Day? My Heart is a great album. I hope that you enjoy this as much as I have.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|My favorite adaptation of Jane Eyre is the Orson Welles version. All subsequent versions have a lot to answer for, so I make a few comparisons between previous versions.<br /><br />Pros:  The casting of this film was a major selling point for me.  Though Jane was not quite as fleshed out as I would've liked, I didn't mind so much given how taken I was by Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester.  True, Michael Fassbender is far more handsome than any Rochester should be, but I think he was just tortured and arrogant enough to pull it off.  The scene in which he puts his hands upon Jane and describes here as a mere reed in his hands was pay-dirt for all of us romantic-drama junkies.  That scene alone was worth the price of admission.  Fassbender had all of the intensity and wounded soul interest that William Hurt couldn't pull off in a previous version of the film.  There was a lot more implied \\"heat\\" between Jane and Rochester that I really enjoyed as something different from other films.  It took some liberties, I think, but never so much that I felt it was untrue to the book.  I think this film did an excellent job depicting Jane's time spent with St. John's family, and gave me a perspective I hadn't had before.<br /><br />Cons:  The ending sucked.  Period.  Yes, yes, I know how it ends, we all do.  But the ending was abrupt to the point of being absurd.  The William Hurt film had a better ending.  Jane's childhood is the launch pad for getting the viewer (or reader) to get in touch with Jane on a personal level.  I felt that it started out fantastic, but her time spent at school was so rushed and skimmed over it didn't have a chance to develop.  Again, the William Hurt film had a far superior childhood depiction, the Orson Welles version even more so.  T
B007UXT6T6|1.0|Tom should be totally embarrassed by this production! I want my money back! It was horrible! It looks like they shot this movie with an iPad!  Cheap!
1402786360|5.0|As other reviewers have noted, this is NOT a typical how-to-bake-a-cake book (although if you need help with that, you'll certainly find it!). Heather is a true artist, and brings a unique perspective to the world of sugary confections. Her stunning (and tasty!) creations are creatively presented and impeccably photographed, but also approachable enough for someone who has zero baking skills or instincts (*ahem*, ME). If you're a fan of her whimsical, colorful, lighthearted blog, you'll find even more to love in the version on paper, because Heather takes you through all the foundational elements of art and baking so that you can apply those techniques to ALL of the delightful recipes both in the book and on her blog.<br /><br />So if you're looking to move away from standard cupcakes, then you'll love trying out such inventive recipes as Sweet Coconut Sushi with Chocolate 'Soy' Sauce or Matcha White Chocolate Cheesecake. And if you've ever wondered how to take inspiration from design and pop culture and apply it to the art of baking, then look no further than the Marikmekko Cookies, Dale Chihuly-Inspired Candy Nesting Bowls, and Mad Hatter Marshmallow Pops.<br /><br />And the icing on the proverbial cake is Heather's down-to-earth writing style and sweet Southern disposition. Trust me, you WON'T be disappointed!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome this game is a lot of fun and I really love playing it. however the music is annoying after a while and I hats the cut away scenes that pop up. I wish I could skip over them.

B000AP04L0|5.0|Mike Judge is a comedic genius. Yes, Idiocracy and Extract, are NO WHERE near as funny, as Office Space, but that's totally ok. Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill have\had excellent writing and as Judge's first live action feature, Office Space has become one of the top comedies\cult favorites of all time.<br /><br />ALL of the actors\characters are fantastic, especially, \\"Bill Lumbergh\\" and Stephen Root's \\"Milton\\". SO MANY memorable lines and scenes. You just have to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />And of course, the famous, copier smashing scene.<br /><br />Ron Livingston plays \\"Peter\\", a man who is tired of his job. Being constantly, hounded about TPS reports and dealing with his cheating wife, as well as watching his co-worker friends being treated unfairly by his company, Peter decides to come-up with a scheme to leave his job in a BIG way. Along the way, he meets\dates a cute waitress (Jennifer Aniston), who is also having problems at her work of showing \\"flair\\" to her boss (Mike Judge).<br /><br />Comedies and humor, really depend on a person. Not everyone is going to laugh at the samething, so if somehow, the humor of Office Space doesn't make you chuckle, that's fine. It's not your kind of comedy.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|I'll keep this short as there are already many reviews here.  Nothing on tv last night, flipping between this and another movie because I HATE the majority of end-of-the-world movies, but got sucked into this one.  It was a solid story line, amazing special effects and the actors didn't over-act.  Even the child actors were not annoying.  Bottom line - it was pure entertainment.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|This game is fun but my game froze at wave 17 so I can get past it because of it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think you should make more stuff based on this because it is very fun I think. Plus I love Ice Age.
B005S9EJZA|5.0|Ok so I am going to start this review off by saying that yes I did read the book before i saw the movie so i will be taking the book into account a couple times throughout this review. Ok so now for the review, this is literally one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life, and i watch movies daily, yes i am a teenager who thinks Zac Efron is a total hunk and would honestly make watching a documentary on the life-cycle of a grasshopper interesting but still this movie is perfection. I believe they cast the perfect people for every character, although i did picture Ben a little differently i got used to him and ended up loving him by the end. They did make a lot of changes from the book to the movie like why he went to find beth, the ending, and the picture but i believe they pulled off every single change they made perfectly. I was so engrossed in the movie there was a part where i almost started clapping but stopped myself before i did cause i was in the audience of the theater and the the church. I cried about 5 times, yes i am a baby in movies, but they were mainly tears of happiness and that is how i know if a movie is good, they developed the characters so well that i got teary eyed when like touching things happened with Beth and her son,Beth and Logan, and also Beth and her brother. Honestly this movie is a perfect adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks book and I am not going to lie I personally liked this movie so much more than I liked the book, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who liked any of the other Nicholas Sparks movies or read the book, it is pure perfection.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|What can I say? I loved it! I've been a Yamato fan since I first saw \\"Star Blazers\\" in eighth grade and have followed it all throughout the years. To finally see a live action version is great. They were respectable to the source material as far as the characters and designs for the most part. I personally wouldn't have changed the Gamilons (Gamilus)as they did, but it still worked pretty well. And in this day and age I suppose you couldn't expect Yuki to just be an innocent damsel. I appreciated that most everything in the movie happened in the show at some point or another. So overall, a must see for Yamato fans and also a good movie for those that are new to it.
0756405890|5.0|Extremely absorbing, extremely fantastic book. Character development is top notch. Rothfuss is a master at painting the scene and drawing you in. This is one of those series that I will be anxiously waiting the next installment and I'll be very sad to see end.<br /><br />I've read a lot of fantasy- Goodkind, Hobb, Haydon, Weis & Hickman, Sandorson, Card, etc. Rothfuss deserves to be mentioned with the greats. I hope book 2 is as good as the first.

0545405777|5.0|The copy I receieved was a very nice boxed edition of The Hunger Games.<br />I received it so fast that I was very surprised and pleased.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|Had it not been for HBO police procedural drama \\"The Wire,\\" I'd like never have really gotten to know Dr. John beyond hits like \\"Right Place Wrong Time.\\" It was that show's creator, writer/producer/showrunner/genius David Simon who - through his latest show, HBO music drama \\"Treme\\" - pushed me to deeper investigate the music culture of New Orleans. \\"Treme,\\" in a very honest, authentic way, celebrates and documents pre- and post-Katrina NOLA, using musicians, both fictional and real, to fill out its cast. Malcolm \\"Dr. John\\" Rebennack, Jr., one of the city's most successful and celebrated songwriters, has turned up on the show four times now as himself, almost always framed by Simon as a living legend. A character that almost reminds me of Spike Lee's Da Mayer from Do the Right Thing. Now, with a new wave of energy and eyes, Dr. John he has a new studio album out, titled Locked Down, that he recorded with Black Keys' frontman Dan Auerbach. Youthful energy continued.    The result is a sweaty, swampy, funky and soulful set of 10 new studio songs that at once feel classic and modern. Auerbach, who has suddenly become \\"The New Jack White\\" (and so Locked is his Van Lear Rose, I suppose), seemingly learned much about production while working with Danger Mouse on 2008's Attack & Release, and he hasn't been the same since. That record, as well as 2010's Brothers, last year's great El Camino and now Locked Down, features a production style that I don't quite have the language to describe. It's hot and modern sounding, not at all unlike the sound Mark Ronson gave Amy Winehouse's Back to Black. It's old and new, familiar and fresh. Perfect for introducing Dr. John to a new generation of listeners. And while those Black Keys platters are surely great collections of IPB (that's Indie Power Blues, baby), I can't help but think that the labors of Auerbach's time spent producing those discs with the Mouse is most full realized - and successful - here, on this collaborative record.John's voice is as gritty, funky and soulful as ever it was on Locked Down, and the songs are lean, clean and hugely accessible. The record, recorded in Nashville with a young crew of players (including, of course, Auerbach), is tight and groove-based while the lyrics are as spiritual, poetic, mystical and primal as you Night Tripper fans could ever hope for. The sound, and songs in general, just feel fat and funky, driven by John's voice and keys and words. His personality and one-of-a-kind moodiness. A soul record that's at times creepy and always weird. Happy but serious. Hopeful and real. Just like NOLA. Just like all the great Dr. John records from the late 60s and early 70s. Records like Dr. John's Gumbo, In the Right Place and, of course, Gris-Gris that I hope this new generation of listeners will investigate. And, even if the kids don't come around, all lifer fans of the Doc should be more than happy with this very solid, very memorable set of new tracks from The Night Tripper. There's not a bad one in the bunch and, amazingly, John and Auerbach never repeat themselves while digging through past sounds and ideas. Chalk Locked Down up as one of the great old-meets-new collaborations of all-time. A new classic, even, I'd say.    Read more of my music- and film-focused writing at [...] Thanks!
B003ELY7PG|5.0|This book is a complete mind changer. It changed my perspective of how to do business, how to face work, goals, clients...<br />Jason and David don't lose any time on \\"expensive talk\\". The book is really easy to read, very direct, very focused.<br />One of my best purchases ever!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have to start this review by saying this my now my FAVORITE book! I started this book yesterday AM and I couldn't put it down from the minute I started it! I was up til 2 AM reading then finished this AM. I am in LOVE with Travis and Abbey.<br /><br />I must say the characters are AMAZING. They are true and rough. They are toxic and co-dependent. They should never be together but they should never be apart. I was having a hard time dealing with how co-dependent Travis and Abbey were but I could understand. I loved them. I was fighting for them the whole book even though it truly seems like a bad idea.<br /><br />Travis is an obsessiveness stalker who got over his one night stand days for Abbey. Even ounce of my body wanted to hate him but I couldn't! I actually LOVE him. I understand him and how he works. The writer makes you get it. Abbey is trying to get rid of her dark past with her dad and being with Travis only reminds her of those days. But how can you feel so safe with someone you aren't suppose to be with? They were made for one another. Travis's whole family saw that. I saw that.<br /><br />This is not a healthy relationship in the real world but things like this happen. One the pages of a book it was truly Beautiful to watch everything unfold. I felt every emotion while reading this book. I was happy, I was sad, I was hurt, I was overjoyed, I was pained, but most of all I was in LOVE. The title of this book is appropriate for the relationship between Abbey and Travis. They needed each other. The ending to this book had me on edge and when it was over I wanted to start all over again. I NEED Travis and Abbey the way they need one another!!!!! I want more. I was so emotional the last few chapters and with how it ended I couldn't have been more pleased. I hope we get more from them.<br /><br />The other characters in this book I loved was Abbey's best friend America and her boyfriend (Travis's cousin). They were amazing together, but what made me appreciate the book even more was Abbey's relationship with America. She has been by Abbey's side since day one they are truly sisters. I loved them just as much I as loved Abbey with Travis.<br /><br />I don't know how I can read another book right now because I am so overjoyed with this book and my mind can't get away from it. This is a feeling I have not had in a long time while reading a book and I thank Jamie McGuire for reminding me while I love reading so muchthe book even more was Abbey's relationship with America. She has been by Abbey's side since day one they are truly sisters. I loved them just as much I as loved Abbey with Travis.<br /><br />I don't know how I can read another book right now because I am so overjoyed with this book and my mind can't get away from it. This is a feeling I have not had in a long time while reading a book and I thank Jamie McGuire for reminding me while I love reading so much
B0079XNWQA|3.0|the cd is awesome. i love Jason Mraz. but the paper/cardboard fold out case the product came in was ripped in half ...im not sending it back or anything but i had to get a new case for it. i am somewhat disappointed
B00002N9ER|1.0|I bought three sets of these. Broke one side of one clip pulling out the flashlight two days after installing them in my Jeep. I had two more sets so I changed out the broken one.  Same deal when I pulled out the flashlight and broke the other of the first set two weeks later, and replaced it. Considering the price I just chalked it up to poor manufacture. Yesterday I pulled the flashlight out and broke the side off of another one. I will remove these clips from my Jeep and look for something more dependable. I wanted to mount a light in my Jeep, RV, and my truck, but these clips are way too brittle to be dependable. I have one brand new set still in the packaging but I will not be mounting them anywhere. I expect a lot out of my tools and Maglite makes a very high quality, dependable flashlight. I am disappointed to see this quality does not extend to this product. The plastic is too brittle for this use.
B0020NH94A|4.0|An excellent book for anyone who has had or had to care for someone with traumatic injury on the challenges of restoring normal life. I loaned this book to a friend with a severe concussion as a result of a driver running a traffic signel and totalling her car. She relates to not remembering things she knows that she knew in detail before the concussion and how her memory and speech functions have slowly returned to 90 % over a 6 month period

B0073U2F2Q|4.0|This movie is as well done an alien invasion movie as the genre will allow.  The moscow scenery and special effects of destruction are first class.  I thought all of the acting was excellent with a little Russian patriotism thrown in for good measure.  I certainly believe it was better than Battle: Los Angeles or Skyline.<br /><br />Like others, I wish they had used the technology developed in the movie to defeat the invaders.<br /><br />One star missing for no real monsters.  I need monsters.  Unfortunately, there has been little to create a really good monster in the last 20 years.  Every monster in recent science fiction films all look exactly the same.

0788160443|5.0|An excellent account of the Roswell Incident with well documented sources, cross referenced with material. Colonel Corso walks us through the night he was able to view one of the Extraterestrial Biological Entities (EBEs) in person, immediately after the Roswell UFO crash, to his military career and major assingment of disseminating the recovered materials from the crashed vehicle for military and civilian use. Looking into different aspects of his account does indeed verify his claims. One example is the night vision goggles and telescopes which took an abrupt turn in approach at the very time Colonel Corso said the alien technology was inserted into the development process. Other aspects too can be independently verified. Of course some will dispute and try to debunk Colonel Corso's account, but in cross referencing with other publications unrelated to UFOs, these indirectly further substantiate his claims. Additionally, someone like Colonel Corso, having been in the top levels of government with the highest security clearances, has nothing to gain at his age when the book was published, and everything to lose. My only regret was not being able to contact him to express my appreciation at his candor while he was still alive. Godspeed, Colonel Corso!
1594203334|5.0|Oh, how I wish I had read this book when my son was a baby! He's starting kindergarten next fall, and we've muddled through after reading plenty of advice from Parents magazine and several good American books. We are blessed with a healthy, lively, and bright young boy. But he didn't sleep through the night until he was 9 months old, he won't touch vegetables and most \\"adult\\" meals, he would never sit still in an upscale restaurant, and he constantly demands my attention. My husband grew up in France and Italy, and he often tried to get me to spend less time focussed on our little one. I thought that was just \\"him,\\" and little did I realize that my husband's philosophy on raising children represents that from an entire culture. Bringing up Bebe explains that thoroughly, drawing on everything from French history, psychology, famous French children's experts, and insightful anecdotes. Ms. Druckerman truly has a talent for observing children and families, and drawing the most useful information out of people she meets and the sources that she reads. I visited Paris with my son last year, and I was incredibly self-conscious as my relatives took us to an upscale restaurant for lunch, and my son was the only child in the restaurant raising a ruckus. How thankful I was when he passed out on the bench next to me with jet-lag before he broke any of the fine crystal! So it was a delight to read Ms. Druckerman's book and say to myself, \\"Oh, that's SO true,\\" when she described her experience with her daughter in a restaurant. Then I found myself saying, \\"Oh, that's SO true\\" throughout the entire book! I particularly relate to this book as a working mom, who often feels guilty about how little time I have to spend with my son. This book has given me a much better perspective on child raising, that has helped in my relationship with my son, as well as confidence in myself as a mother.

B00005U2LM|5.0|This album was put out very soon after \\"The W\\" and there was hesitance to listen to this album because \\"The W\\" had alot of hit or miss tracks that were experimental (not saying \\"The W\\" wasn't good at all because it had some tracks that were really good).<br />Anyway, \\"Iron Flag\\" kind of perfects the mistakes of the album before it and continues to be innovative in beats and backing music.<br /><br />On this album, RZA reigns in the experimentation some and let's the basic sound that made Wu-Tang originally shine through more. At the same time, he builds on the original sound and almost updates it for the times. Some people saw that as making everything more polished and taking a step backwards, but without growth of some kind, the Wu would begin to sound out-dated and I've got a feeling RZA realized that.<br /><br />As far as the verses from the members, not all of the Wu members get equal amounts of time on the mic but the important thing is that the album sounds good the way it is. ODB was nowhere to be found on this album but I was impressed that they could hold everything together still (while ODB is missed, I can't deny that the members who did get their time in the spotlight did a great job). The only tracks I couldn't get into were \\"In the Hood\\" and \\"Back in the Game\\" because they felt disjointed to me.<br /><br />The Wu Tang rap really hardcore on this album mainly focusing on the struggles of the streets, post 9/11 attitude towards everything in general, and sometimes trying to explain how it's difficult embracing fame and explaining how they've changed how they see things.<br /><br />I'm glad that RZA was able to help strike a balance of innovation and experimentation while making it easier for the other members of the Wu to flow with what his vision was.<br /><br />If you love the Wu, give this album a chance and don't expect to hear the old sound of 36 Chambers or even Wu-Tang Forever. This is different but good in it's own way.<br /><br />If you're just getting into the Wu, start with \\"Enter the 36 Chambers\\" and go from there.getting into the Wu, start with \\"Enter the 36 Chambers\\" and go from there.

B005KR6OBM|5.0|THE BIG BANG THEORY is a sitcom about a group of Cal-Tech physicists who can unlock the mysteries of the universe but are too socially inept to connect with most people here on Earth. Even though she doesn't always appear to have a terribly high IQ or an affinity for quantum physics, Penny's looks and willingness to befriend them has the geeky guys trying their best to charm her with their limited social skills.  Penny, it sometimes puts forward the stereotypical \\"dumb blonde\\" image (though women with brains and awkwardness to match the guys' have been introduced as the series has progressed). But in the end, this show is about a group of nice guys basically having fun and looking for love.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Innovation at it's best. This app opens up music to music lovers by providing a central hub to access the tunes. Nicely done.
0307352145|5.0|Brilliant book. Contains a lot of amazing research that just made me feel better and better about myself. For many years, I struggled with trying to be a team player - I was a management consultant so that was one of the highest values. But it's just not me. A few years ago, I embraced my introversion and started to understand my energy levels and how they worked. I particularly like the section on how introverts can act like extroverts when it is important to them - this is how I do public speaking. But I need at least a day to recover afterwards. This book will help you if you are an introvert,  or if you want to understand those people in your lives who need solitude and silence. Fantastic.
1612130283|1.0|I just could not stifle the laughter reading this book. My small inner goddess refused to talk to me thinking that my IQ dropped at least 50 points. This is an embarrassing writing.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not sure what the fuzz was all about with this book. I found that it was very highschool level as far as the excitement level as far as the \\"uhh's and ahh's\\" about the sexual content. Maybe because I am european and do not have a puritian background, but this was by no means a \\" daring and sexual explicit\\" book. A 21 year old virgin, meeting a S & M kind of high roller ? Not very believable, not enticing and quite frankly there was just no plot other than \\"is she , or isn' she\\" going to give in. Safe your money. Of course if you have never had sex, or only had sex with one, boring person, then maybe this book is for you.

B006Z21ZGK|5.0|This is a solid performance from one of the most important hard rock bands in history. Though in their mid-late 50's, they still get it done. Smith and Murray can still shred. It is impressive to say the least. Bruce is still a solid front man, Nicko still plays barefoot, and Steve Harris still mouths the lyrics. If you have Live After Death on video then you know what Maiden looked like in their prime. They may jump around a little less, look a little older, and not wear spandex these days but musically they are just as strong as ever. The new songs in this concert are solid Maiden tunes. Due to the time, they will never replicate another 2 Minutes to Midnight or The Trooper, but that doesn't mean the new stuff isn't as good. Sadly, it's just not in style these days like it was in the 80's.<br /><br />If you're a true Maiden fan, you will not be disappointed. Get this.
1468161660|5.0|I have a hard time even expressing my thoughts for this incredible book. It was a ride of emotions from start to finish. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me upset and it made me feel things I didnt know I could from a book.<br /><br />The story of Lake and Will is one if friendship, love, hurt, loss, and so much more. It'll blow you away and in all the good ways.<br /><br />Ms. Hoover did an amazing job. Bravo to her and her writing abilities.

B003EYVXV4|2.0|The Hunger Games: what a stupid film! This is a typical Hollywood movie where one can guess an hour in advance how it is going to evolve. We have to say thank you to these screenwriters, producers and directors if cruelty and violence become a normal ingredient of our society. A number of young people who have already seen 100.000 murders on TV before they get 20, might have nothing else than such rubbish to compare their life values to.<br /><br />The characters in this film, and the whole story, are too silly to spend more words on them. There's many films where characters fight against injustice and violence, they don't play passively with it. I don't know how people really believe that this is a film against violence and totalitarianism... it really takes much more than this! If you write such a poor screenplay, and in my opinion this is clearly the case, the result is the opposite of what is supposed to be, fostering cruelty and violence. A blockbuster that goes well with pop-corns. People like to see violence, more and more violence so their adrenaline goes up, and that's sad.<br /><br />Two stars just because from a technical perspective, it must have been challenging to shoot a film like this, and the outcome is not that bad.

1847879071|1.0|I bought this book as recommended by a colleague for dissertation help and for me found the book to be as the title of this review states, disappointing. The authors try to use humor when explaining statistics and when providing examples but I found that it was kind of tedious and the concepts I was looking for was kind of lost. I found myself thinking: \\"get to the point!\\" at times, which is too bad because I was really looking forward to this book. I think its a difference in style preferences. When it comes to statistics and SPSS, I like my books to be a little more to the point without all the extra \\"fluff\\" it you will.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List shows how one person who was a non-Jewish descent can care for those who are different.  History tells the story of the holocaust as one of the darkest part of human history.  As true as this is, the movie impacts how Oskar Schindler, a follower of the Nazi leaders, had tried to save the lives of approximately 1,100 Jews during the holocaust.  The way Schindler did this was by employing Jews to work in his factory which kept the Jews from being deported out of the city where they lived and possibly sent to a concentration camp where they possibly were murdered.  There were some scenes in the movie that showed what happened to some of the Jews who worked for Schindler.  If the Nazi army did not agree with Schindler's choices, some were shot in broad daylight in front of many others who were in the middle of working.  Schindler did not agree with this and even mentioned how killing some of his workers had delayed production and was making him lose money due to not enough work staff.<br /> As for the Jewish side of the movie, they depicted the truth as to what the Jews did in order to survive the holocaust.  Some went into hiding and some had friends who worked for the Nazi leaders that tried to help them escape.  The movie also depicts how the Jews were treated if they were found in their hiding places and deported to concentration camps.  It shows the incarnation of dead bodies in some of the camps and Schindler's reaction to this treatment.  Even though all the bad things were shown, the movie also shows how Schindler was kind to all Jews but in particular the movie depicts how he liked all women, including Jewish women.  This causes Schindler to be looked at a different way by the Nazi leaders.  Even though Schindler went through a lot of pressure, he still makes a list of 1,100 Jews near the tail end of the movie of who he wanted to be saved.  He saved them by having them go to his hometown and work at his factory.<br />Even though Schindler may have risked his own life and possibly be looked at differently for saving Jews during the holocaust, it was something that he felt that he needed to do.  The movie is a great example of explaining that even during the worst part of human history where there was mass murdering of innocent people, there was one person who really did try to make a difference in preventing more innocent people from being victims.

Highly recommend The Forever Girl for those looking for something supernatural, something new, something great to read.  Fantastic work!  Can't wait for the next one!

B000002V1D|4.0|This is a good hard phase of the band using more keyboards and dance music. This disc also features bassist John Taylor and at this stage, along with Notorious and Big Thing are the best albums. There are songs like Ordinary World, Come Undone and Femme Fatale are the band's successes to date. There are other good songs on the record as Too Much Information, Breath After Breath, Shelter and Sin Of The City. Those who like the band can not help but listen and buy. Very Good!

Got this one, version 6, and had no difficulty seeing that the user interface is better, easy on the eyes and things seem to be cleaner and quicker than Docs to Go. REALLY like this one and LOVE the fact that I got it for just $7.50.

1603429999|5.0|My grandmother taught me to knit on straight needles, but, when I discovered that circular needles were so much more useful, I gave away all my straight needles and never looked back.  It wasn't all chocolate and roses after that, however.  There were certain imperfections I just lived with - after all, knitting in the round was much more pleasant than knitting and joining flat pieces.  But now, after devouring Margaret Radcliffe's newest work, \\"Circular Knitting Workshop,\\" I've upped my knitting skills by several levels.  Wow - from good to great!<br /><br />Here's my take on \\"Circular Knitting Workshop.\\"<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  This is a book about techniques - lots and lots of techniques that will boost the quality of your finished products.  Of course, there are patterns, many of which are very cute, but their main function is to demonstrate how to use a specific technique. Most are quick and/or small, so you can try them out immediately.<br /><br />I've already learned several techniques to get rid of that pesky \\"jog\\" that shows where a round starts anew.  That's always bothered me, and I am so pleased to learn how to avoid it.<br /><br />2.  Knitting with double-pointed needles has never been a favorite with me, but sometimes it cannot be avoided.  You'll find a good section on using double-points that will be invaluable when, for example, you want to make seamless sleeves or flat round objects.  The color photographs take you through each step so you'll come out with excellent results.<br /><br />3.  Binding off is covered in depth.  There are many instances where a tight bind-off detracts from the quality of your finished garment, but now you can choose from a number of stretchy bind-offs that will enhance quality and making wearing the garment a pleasure rather than a trial.<br /><br />4.  If you're like me and like seamless garments, you'll love the section on converting flat patterns to circular.  Isn't it great to come to the end of a pattern without having to do all the finishing work?  And, be sure to see the section on knitting in loose ends - more ways to avoid that annoying finishing duty.<br /><br />5.  I've always carped about knitting books bound as paperbacks, but the paper in this book is so heavy that, when you open the book, it will stay open where you're working. Overall, the quality of the book itself is excellent, and the photo illustrations are truly helpful.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />I find nothing to object to in this book.  It's filled with \\"essential\\" techniques that I'm pleased to master.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />This book belongs in every knitter's library.  Get it.  You'll be so glad to have it as a handy reference!  Don't even ask to borrow my copy; it resides in my library permanently.<br /><br />Five Stars Plus!hout having to do all the finishing work?

B004UID2LC|4.0|I listen to a lot of old rock music, and when I download them as no3 files they sound terrible. Although, these days nobody really cares about sound quality, but I do, make an option to download higher quality mp3s (yes, downloading it as an AAC file is better, but it doesn't work on my device)
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Firstly, I need to say. Sylvia Day, I blame you completely for the dark circles under my eyes today. And for all of the readers out there, a warning: DO NOT start reading this book late at night. You will not be able to put it down. You will not be able to stop thinking about the characters, and it will interrupt your sleep. I started this book last night and dropped everything else to finish it this morning. What a great novel! And for all of the fans of Fifty Shades of Grey out there, you especially will love this book. It's similar to Fifty Shades, but still different enough to love it.<br /><br />Similarities:<br />A male character who tries to negotiate a relationship: There is no contract but Gideon's approach to Eva is very Fifty-ish. I loved it though. I was posting quotes from this book at 10% in, 12% in, 15% in, and finally I decided to stop before I drove people crazy.<br /><br />Stubborn heroine: Eva's reaction to Gideon was very Ana-ish as well, but no less amusing. Quote: \\"Are you kidding?\\" I scowled. \\"Listen to yourself. Why even call it a f__k? Why not be clear and call it a seminal emission in a preapproved orifice?\\" She is equally affronted and intrigued by Gideon's approach. The negotiations kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Tortured Hero: Move over Christian Grey, Gideon Cross has just taken over the role of favorite, bad boy tortured hero. And did I mention he's smokin' hot? Still, I love that Sylvia Day evens the playing field by having a troubled past for Eva as well. They are both survivors fighting to find a way to have a normal relationship, even though neither of them has the first clue how to go about it.<br /><br />HOT, HOT, HOT: as much as I hate the dreaded \\"Mommy Porn\\" label Fifty has been given, the book is hot. And if you think Fifty Shades is hot you will find Bared to You positively scorching.<br /><br />Still, with all of the similarities I didn't feel in any way that the book was a copy. It is a great book with its ownplot. The characters are well developed and engaging. Sometimes they make you mad, but their faults make them all the more endearing. Gideon's and Eva's relationship was consuming, I was sucked right it. It was just the right amount of dysfunction. So far, this is my favorite book of 2012.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is kinda a copy off of city story. But it is still totally fun, but I did have troubles getting out of the app but it is very fun and appropriate for the younger kids in this continent the Usa.  Where I am visiting for the year. I believe every thing in America should be more appropriate do any other mummy's agree with me I think English are weird and British are not. I think all apps should be this appropriate. AGREE WITH ME!!!

B001LM1456|1.0|The positive reviews were saying that this movie takes the old comic books and TV shows and combines them to make the best Hulk incarnation yet. All I can say is, if this is Hulk at its best, thank goodness I never wasted my time on the old stuff. I don't care whether it was a good adaption of a comic book or not, as a MOVIE, it completely sucked. I didn't care about the one-dimensional characters, and the plot was nothing more than a rush from one far-too-long action sequence to the next.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed the other movies in the Avengers series. Iron Man has been brilliant, and Thor was pretty good. Captain America was only okay (poor villains can take a lot away from a good film), but I'd probably watch it again. However, I was severely disappointed by Hulk. It does not live up to the rest of the franchise. In fact, for the whole film I was doubting whether I was even watching the correct Hulk, until the appearance of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in the last scene (which, in my opinion, was the most interesting scene in the whole film).

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Initially I had no real interest in reading this book - it's a bit out of my normal genre of books.  But everyone was talking about it so I thought why not?  So glad that I did!<br /><br />This was one of those books that once you start reading it, you just can't put it down!  Certainly it's an easy read, but it is a fast-paced read.<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much that I suggested that my husband and daughter read it!

B003O86FMW|5.0|It's not often that you can say that the second book in a series is as good as the first was.  But in this case it is true.  This book is another page-turner that had me avoiding everything and everyone until I finished reading the book.  The storyline continues smoothly and keeps you interested.<br /><br />This is another must read.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is easy to play and it doesn't take an extremely long time to get enough money to do things, the way some games do. Scrat's mini game is addictively entertaining and the mini movie is cute.  The only thing it's lacking is an exit button.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I have to admit that this is my least favorite in the series.  In the first two books the characters were likable and you rooted for them.  In this final book I lost my vested interest in the main characters.  The storyline didn't seem within keeping with the characters earlier beliefs.  Sad to say, I was actually glad when the book ended as it was a little bit of a chore to finish it.
B005FFW46S|3.0|Snuff is a good read.  It lacks some of the humor of his other stuff but I feel it is a little lost. There are some true Pratchett moments like a children's writer who writes books about Poo. Some have said that this book is darker than the rest, but I am not so sure that darker means lacking in jokes.  What I think was missing through was the hero.  Grimes was always the cynical police sergeant who ended up doing the right thing. Here he seemed less focused.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I think this book is a great read, not only for the Young Adult market as an introduction to Sci-Fi/Fantasy, but also for adults who appreciate an engrossing story.  I had to buy the next two books to see how the story ends.  I saw the film but I preferred the book, and I have recommended it to my two teenage daughters.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Good little time killer,  even though I do not like the part where certain options in the game were blocked off until you paid actual money for them.

B0074YVW1G|4.0|For years (and years) society has beat up introverts for not being 'normal'. If you're not a natural team player, or salesperson, something must be wrong with you. If you'd rather be alone and read a book, you should see a therapist.<br /><br />Susan Cain's book, 'Quiet - The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking' changes all those pre-conceptions.<br /><br />This thoroughly researched and enlightening book covers how extroversion had dominated psychology-think for decades. Then, explains that those people who are extroverts, generally jump into things quickly, without thinking much, whereas introverts take their time and make more considered decisions.<br /><br />In an interview, Susan Cain explained why she wrote this book. \\"Many introverts believe that there is something wrong with them.\\"<br /><br />\\"The bias against introversion leads to a colossal waste of talent, energy, and, ultimately, happiness.\\"<br /><br />To think that you have to be, or pretend to be, an extrovert to make it in this world is just plain wrong. And narrow-minded. Many introverts have turned out to have created extraordinary gifts for our lives. Numerous renowned historical and currently living individuals are self-proclaimed introverts, like Warren Buffett,  and Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak.<br /><br />Extroverts crave external stimulation. Being surrounded by people and lots of noise. Introverts embrace the 'Power of Quiet.'<br /><br />Ms. Cain writes how in brainstorming sessions and meetings, the more thoughtful and intelligent thinkers are often participants who get drowned out by the more verbal extroverts, which ultimately can harm an organization.<br /><br />She also writes that, \\"Some companies are starting to understand the value of silence and solitude, and are creating \\"flexible\\" open plans that offer a mix of solo workspaces, quiet zones, casual meeting areas, caf&eacute;s, reading rooms, computer hubs, and even \\"streets\\" where people can chat casually with each other without interrupting others' workflow.\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, she makes reference to a study, \\"of sixty-four traders at an investment bank, found that the highest-performing traders tended to be emotionally stable introverts.\\"<br /><br />The book covers the introvert psyche from birth, through personal relationships and how past and current organizational structures inhibit more than a third of the world's population, who may be classified as introverted.  \\"Our schools, workplaces, and religious institutions are designed for extroverts.\\"<br /><br />So, it turns out that it's OK to be an introvert (and an extrovert). More importantly, that people should understand that it's alright to seek solitude and time alone. You don't always have to make the most noise or to try to fit in all the time.<br /><br />The author puts it best when she writes, \\"If there is only one insight you take away from this book... I hope it's a newfound sense of entitlement to be yourself.\\"ther without interrupting others' workflow.\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, she makes reference to a study, \\"of sixty-four traders at an investment bank, found that the highest-performing traders tended to be emotionally stable introverts.\\"<br /><br />The book covers the introvert psyche from birth, through personal relationships and how past and current organizational structures inhibit more than a third of the world's population, who may be classified as introverted.  \\"Our schools, workplaces, and religious institutions are designed for extroverts.\\"<br /><br />So, it turns out that it's OK to be an introvert (and an extrovert).

B007UXSDYU|1.0|Why would anyone go to so much effort to make such a good looking man (Milo Ventimiglia)look monstrous? Michael Biehn also had to have his good looks turned into a grizzled mess. This could have been a very different movie, if you ladies know what I mean hehe. Even the wimpy foreign guy was pleasing to the eye when he wasn't crying like a lost puppy. Other than the eye candy, it was depressing, dark, and seemed meaningless. Nothing original or creative, just the standard rape-to-death sicko fantasy world for guys that want society to end. This movie played like someone gave a basic outline and the rest was impromptu, without anyone knowing or caring how it ends or any of the details along the way. The characters were all very flawed or very weak, or both. Would not watch again, would not recommend.
B003N5VOUO|4.0|Enough of the previous reviews here have discussed the plot of My Name is Khan, so I won't rehash it here.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Bollywood movies, but my interest in My Name is Khan (a movie I had never heard of before) was piqued by an article I recently read about Shah Rukh Khan following his recent detainment while entering the US. Rather than the usual garish musical spectacle, it sounded as though My Name is Khan would be a serious film that explored some important issues of relevance in post-9/11 America.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was that the protagonist of My Name is Khan is a man with Asperger Syndrome, a form of autism. This was something the article I'd read failed to mention, giving his statement \\"My name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist\\" quite a different context than if it were coming from a \\"normal\\" person. That is, it became less of a political statement, and more of the kind of obsessive attention to a subject that is frequently cited as one of the signs of Asperger's.<br /><br />Oddly enough, watching this film illuminated for me some of the conceits of Hollywood films through its own conceits. For example, some of the portrayals of Americans in My Name is Khan are rather stereotypical; then again, Hollywood has portrayed people from other parts of the world through stereotypes for decades. Another example is the television news graphics, particularly the ones connected with the election of President Obama, whose name is strictly avoided; thus, we get the oddly worded \\"First African American President\\" on-screen graphics, which I never saw on any actual broadcast during the election. The inauthenticity of this actually took me out of my suspension of disbelief--as did the depiction of the fictional town of Wilhelmina, Georgia, which looks like no American town I've ever seen. Here again, the television news graphics depicted, with their references to \\"Georgia State\\", briefly took me out of my suspension of disbelief. And, let us not forget the absurdity of any group of Americans having no problem whatsoever understanding a speaker who is speaking primarily in Hindi--which is really not so absurd when you think of any number of Hollywood movies in which Europeans converse entirely in English, albeit sometimes with accents.<br /><br />Those distractions aside, I found My Name is Khan to be a surprisingly moving story. Despite my best efforts, I became teary-eyed in a few spots towards the end of the movie, something which rarely happens when I watch movies.<br /><br />Some have complained that My Name is Khan is \\"preachy\\" and \\"self-serving\\", and one review on Amazon actually (if improbably) reduces it to \\"feel-good leftist pro-Muslim anti-American pro-Obama anti-Bush Bollywood propaganda that successfully rivals 1930-s Soviet state propaganda films.[sic]\\" Granted, in many ways, the movie is a bit simplistic. But, in that respect, it is no less offensive than many Hollywood movies that have been less than subtle in trying to convey messages. (Actually, the comparison made in another review to Forrest Gump is probably more appropriate.)<br /><br />At the same time, though, the movie does not exempt its own characters from examination. Witness Khan's brother's objection to his marriage on the basis that his bride-to-be is not Muslim, which echoes the Hindu-Muslim tensions witnessed during the brothers' youth; or his wife's emotionally fraught conclusion that the tragedy which has befallen them is because of her husband's Muslim name. Though perhaps not as obvious to American sensibilities, it's clear that the makers of this movie aren't limiting their awareness of prejudice and intolerance to Americans.<br /><br />It is worth mentioning briefly that the casting of CNN commentator Fareed Zakaria as a radical Muslim cleric is a nice bit of casting against type. And Zakaria does surprisingly well as portraying the anger of the character.<br /><br />At its heart, though, My Name is Khan is alove story. The main character's narrative consists of letters he writes to his wife as he makes is way around the US in hopes of meeting the president so he can tell him that \\"my name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist.\\" This journey, of course, is the one he has undertaken in hopes that his wife will take him back after the tragedy that has torn them apart.<br /><br />I really have only two criticisms of this movie. One is the Wilhelmina, Georgia subplot. Though I understand how it fits into the movie, it often feels like a gratuitous diversion. The other is that it's probably 30 minutes too long. Particularly during the Wilhelmina sequences, I found my attention starting to wander.<br /><br />But, overall, I found My Name is Khan to be quite good. I would definitely recommend seeing it at least once.love story.

0446572993|4.0|While The Innocent has some small flaws, it really measures up to my first criterion: \\"Did i get my money's worth of entertainment out of it?\\" This modernized version of 007 \\"Licensed to kill\\" opens with a sniper hit and then drives into the action of the novel. It's the sort of hook that makes this novel a kind of salted peanuts read. The complexity of the plot almost gets in the way of the action a couple times and some anti-climactic scenes may have been better served by earlier reveals. The tangle of characters is a bit tenuous. Some situations are just a little too pat (the lacking star) but this is almost textbook on how to compose a thriller. As a sort of side issue, maybe I think along the same lines as Mr. Baldacci, but I seem to spot his villians earlier than a reader really should. I will not spoil it, but after reading I think many will agree.
B00729Z782|5.0|I came to this album through Marillion, as keyboardist Mark Kelly was a special guest. I wasn't expecting too much, but was surprised in a good way. From beginning to end, this album is one of those rare ones where every note just falls into place. Influences appear from Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, and Mike Oldfield, but at no point is the sound unoriginal or dull. Riveting stuff. The highlights are Marty and the Magic Moose - Oldfield pastiche with a metal twist - and the whole King of Number 33 epic. Sweet, charming, and terribly sad. As to the lyrics: if you can seamlessly work in words like regicide and Elysium, you have my undying respect.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game is great, and then it breaks. When it is working, this is my favorite app on my Kindle Fire, but every once in a while all of the building, crop, and animal timers go up to about 200 hours. When that happens you can: A) delete the bugged items and rebuild, B) hope for random disasters that \\"restart production,\\" or wait out the 200 hour timer to use the item again. Option A is very costly, and lumber is limited (there are only so many trees to cut down to build the same building again and saplings aren't working correctly) Option B is the best bet, but just dumb luck. Option C is futile because they will bug out again long before that timer ever runs out.<br /><br />This game was great until I got to about level 15 and the timer bug started happening. It is unplayable in its current condition.

B000654YK6|3.0|THE GOOD:<br />More than a music doc, this is a relevant, illuminating and moving music film. I knew most of the big north-west bands but I had no idea of the context in which they developed, circumstances and the deeply american nature of the whole thing. Hype! quickly turned into my most replayed doc ever. This film captured a pop-culture explosion from within. As Art Chantry put, &#34;It's fascinating to be able to see it for yourself&#34;; I was transported to Seattle circa 1988-94. its plot has all the ingredients of a great play: humble beginnings, a great struggle, a moment of ascension, a tragic crash-and-burn, and a bitterly optimistic aftermath.<br /><br />the bands involved offered amazing insight and were very entertaining to see and hear live. Some of them were low profile, bands that didn't break; some others were de rigueur names offering down-to earth and quirky commentary. I have since acquired albums by FASTBACKS, FLOP and MUDHONEY thanks to this doc.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />no extras. it seems this film went under the radar, judging from the poor digital offering here. The doc is great, this DVD is not. While it's commendable that the publisher digitized and released it, It has absolutely no extra content or bonus material. The yards of unedited footage that must have been left out of this cut makes me froth at the mouth. Take for instance The Year Punk Broke, the bonus features nearly doubled the length of the main film. Hype! deserves this treatment. I give it three stars solely on its digital shortcomings. You might as well watch it on Youtube in the same quality.<br /><br />Will we ever see a BLURAY release? I doubt it. The quality is there, the cinematography of Hype! is impeccable, it was shot in glorious 16mm. Watch Nirvana's Live at the Paramount in BLURAY and you'd see how incredible Hype! would be in 1080p. But it's probably never going to happen. the 90s was a disaster for future-proofing video. Similarly to the X-Files tv series, Hype! must have been transferred from film rolls to VHS tape for the editing process; BIG MISTAKE. This resulted in miserable and constrained 480i transfers that cannot be restored or improved in any way.<br /><br />Here's hopping that 2016 sees a properly remastered release of Hype! when it turns 20 years old, with an extended 2 hour director's cut, deleted scenes, and extended interviews.

Here's hopping that 2016 sees a properly remastered release of Hype! when it turns 20 years old, with an extended 2 hour director's cut, deleted scenes, and extended interviews. It might not happen but it's sure fun to imagine.
B000RJMQRE|5.0|I was introduced to this story from the movie of the same name.  This graphic novel is wonderful.  Very fun, captivating, illustrated beautifully.  A must read!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Good on the phone. But needs to be available over internet or the computer for longer notes where a keyboard would be preferred.
0761169253|5.0|Easy to read and full of great insights. It's the perfect motivational speech for young creatives. I highly recommend this book.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great game for kids.  great for killing time for adults too.  I bought for my four year old and he loves it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my first review after many years as an Amazon customer. I felt that strongly about this book. I started with the first installment, which stands alone as a great short story, then went on to buy the omnibus edition. The rest of the story expanded on the original idea marvelously. I am a big fan of apocalyptic fiction, but it would still make a great read for those who aren't fans of the genre. The apocalyptic setting is incidental to the story, though I don't see it happening without it as a prerequisite. It would make a great film! I'll be looking for more titles by this author.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|Jill Taylor explains her experience in a way that provides profound insights about the brain and brain health. I didn't have words to express certain things that I see in others and myself, and her book has helped me to realize that I'm not imagining things; Some silent, invisible injuries are as powerful as any other kind and that the body has a way to help heal itself.
0684857219|4.0|I bought this book because I wanted to get serious about working out. Arnold's Schwarzenegger book is one of the best book I read. It's easy to follow. It also shows illustrations of techniques that you might want to work on. It also describes nutritional value which is as important as working out.  I'm getting a lot of useful information from the book. I'm glad I bought it.,

B000A0GP0Y|5.0|I purchased this DVD through Columbia House as part of my agreement with Columbia House DVD and I love this movie.  I rated it a 5 star because it's awesome.  I removed from my wish list only because I purchased it already.
0596007124|4.0|I really liked the first chapter in the book - some advice on how to learn and retain the material. Every book should have this - author's suggestions on how to retain the material the author/s spew. The book is very very good in helping to retain the patterns in your head. But to achieve this i think some of the illustrations used are contrived. Perhaps the examples could've been more drawn from some real world applications ? Very good book nevertheless.
B005UG542S|3.0|The streaming was smooth, but the entire film was dark on my screen. Some of the scenes were so dark all I could see was Voldemort's pale face - the background was almost completely black. I set my screen brightness as high as I could, and even tried recalibrating my screen to see if it was a problem with my computer. I thought it might have simply been how the film was shot, but once I received the dvd and played it on my computer I didn't have a problem with it being too dark. My conclusion was that it was a problem with the streaming video. It's a lovely concept; not having to wait for the dvd to arrive in the mail, but it was almost worth waiting for the dvd to arrive so I could actually see entire the film.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I was in shock when I saw that it takes up 138.8 Mb. that is a lot of space I could never fit this app on my kindle fire
B007NYODBS|5.0|One of those films that seems more like an intense dramatic stageplay than an actual movie.  Which is good in this case.  Sends up a lot of liberal cliches, while the convervative social agenda doesn't look that pretty either.  Fine acting by all parties, with very funny interludes among all the intensity.  If you share some of the life experieces of these characters, e.g. professional/high achieving,competitive, etc. you might recognize yourself and break out in a really hard laugh.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I got the white iPhone 4s because I really liked how sharp the white on metal looked. So, what was the point of buying a case that completely covered it up? It took me a while to find a case that was clear and was NOT a hard case. I wanted a case that would be clear, yet also provide at least SOME kind of shock protection in case of the inevitable drop. The case is a flexible, clear rubber, which was just what I was looking for. The case is perfectly clear, with the exception of the circle pattern on the back. I wasn't thrilled with it when I saw it in the pictures, but for the price, it wasn't enough of a barrier. Now that it's on my phone, it's not as bad as I thought. The center circle is placed so that the Apple logo is centered and shows clearly. The cutout for the camera and flash is wide enough so as not to reflect the flash into the pictures you take. One thing that kind of annoys me, is that it says \\"Amazon Basics\\" at the bottom of the case, on the back. It's not huge, or really even that noticeable, but if you know it's there, then you tend to notice it more than others would. The other cutouts for the volume buttons and the port at the bottom are nice and big so that if you have larger fingers, you can still get to the buttons. The top edge of the case comes up enough to provide protection if you place your phone face down. The overall fit of the case is pretty secure. A nice \\"throw-in\\" feature of this purchase is the screen protector. I have a Zagg Invisible Shield on mine, so I did not use the included one. Speaking of the Invisible Shield, I wish I was a little more careful when I put the case on my phone. During the process, the lip of the case must have caught the edges of my Invisible Shield, because it started to \\"bubble\\" at the sides. So, if you're a fellow \\"Zagg\\" user, beware. I'm going to get the shield replaced so I'll be interested to see if it happens again. I'm not sure if having a larger shield that extends to the edge of the phone would help, or if one that is more centered on the face of the phone would be better. Overall, though, I really like the case, and for the price, you can't beat it. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't have \\"Amazon Basics\\" on it, and didn't rip up my Invisible Shield.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoy it. it is fun and educational. my younger siblings enjoy it as well. this game is very addictive. I cant put jiffy down.
B00000I07P|5.0|There are albums worth owning and being part of everyone's collection regardless of what musical genre they belongs to. If Glam/Hair Metal has such an album it's definitely Bon Jovi's acclaimed and widely successful third album Slippery When Wet. This album alone has \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\", \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\" and \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\", three solid singles on their own enough to rise any album to top sales on their own in 1986 and they're all here on one album. Slippery has very glossy, pop production and a slick sound. Not every song stood the test of time (Social Disease is one that comes to mind) but a lot of them have and as a whole Slippery When Wet is a Glam masterpiece. Simply put Bon Jovi's finest hour. They recruited songwriter Desmond Child to help make them into the superstars they wanted to be and be successful. Obviously it worked as SWW sold over 12 million copies in the US alone, over 28 worldwide.  I'm not saying that this album is groundbreaking by any means but it's highly enjoyable, well crafted songs with rock guitars (and ok, keyboards) and a pop edge.<br /><br />\\"Let It Rock\\" is very reminiscent of Def Leppard (in fact they even have a song with the same title that predates Bon Jovi by a good five years).  Good slow-rock tune to open the album, nice sing-along chorus yet there's still a little heavyness. Then after come the monster hits. \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\". \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\" is probably the definitive Bon Jovi song and rightfully so, it's everything the band stood for then and now. It's incredibly and undeniably catchy, almost impossible not to sing along to and has a badass bass line. \\"Social Disease\\" has a comical beginning but other than that little entertainment value I consider it not much more than a filler track, the beginning is very cheesy. \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" is the proof that the band aren't just pretty boys and that they have musical talent. John's lyrics on that song are as amazing today as they were in '86 an Richie Sambora's guitar playing is masterful, the far-west sound he is able to achieve on that sound and the things he does here validates him and the band as musicians worthy of the name.  \\"Raise Your Hands\\" is a cool song that shouldn't be forgotten. The catchy and VERY pop, upbeat keyboard driven \\"Without Love\\" is another excellent tune that's worth a few listens, borders on sappy.<br /><br />Bon Jovi went on to adapt their sounds to the times in usually succesfull attempts to stay relevant, they were in during the 1980's matured during the 90's and even went for a country sound later in their career. They prove they could adapt and expand their sound but their definitive album and the one that still sells concert tickets is Slippery When Wet. For the record, it's not my favorite Bon Jovi album but it's one that got me and millions of other into them and serves well as an entry point. I respect Bon Jovi as artists who evolved and changed with time but to be honest those are still the songs people want to hear when they pay to see the band live and those are still the Bon Jovi songs most often played on the radio, there I said it. I can't think of a better place to get into the band, start here and build your way up. My real rating is four out of five stars but for nostalgia values I'll nod it up to a 5/5.ichie Sambora's guitar playing is masterful, the far-west sound he is able to achieve on that sound and the things he does here validates him and the band as musicians worthy of the name.  \\"Raise Your Hands\\" is a cool song that shouldn't be forgotten.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was hesitant to read the third installment of The Hunger Games trilogy because of all the negative reviews. As someone who must finish what she starts, my curiosity about how this whole thing ends took over. I completed the book this morning and I'm very glad I did. It ended as this series should end - dark, sad, yet hopeful. For the naysayers complaining that this book is too depressing - have you read the first two books? What did you think this would be? The Hunger Games is one of the most haunting, stomach-turning series I've ever encountered. You feel for these characters, you root for them, you become attached to them. The atrocities perpetrated against them affect you as a reader. You finish these books cherishing your family, your friends, and your free will just a little bit more. I applaud the author for not sugar-coating the ending, for not demeaning the spirit of the books by tying a nice little bow on the last page. Do not let the negative reviews deter you from finishing this series - Mockingjay is worth your time. Bravo to Ms. Collins on a series well-done.
B00005YJ5Q|5.0|If you have never listened to Can before, I would highly recommend giving Tago Mago a whirl.<br /> Definately Krautrock at it's best.
055357342X|1.0|Has anyone but me noticed that most of the female individuals in the book are either underage or being abused and disempowered? Very weird... What kind of sadistic and sexually repressed mind would write this stuff? Who are the readers that give these books five stars and actually \\"like\\" this mess? Besides the strangely negative, sadistic and perverse text, this material is soooooo repetitive and boring. No commitment to anything of substance like story or characters. With no imagination or creativity the author is jumping all over the place like a preteen with untreated ADHD and attachment issues. I can't believe this soapy-simple stuff was up for an award, ever! I recommend some therapy for potential socio-sexual issues and focus. I am certainly not touching this trash again. One would have to be a masochist to keep reading this cruel nonsense.
B0034IJ7M2|5.0|Even though this a work of fiction, it is a very accurate depiction of how crippling addiction is. It is a real eye opener to those who don't have a clue about addiction.  I've marked several pages for future reference - to look back and ponder some of the more poignant information.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Like so many others, I had seen the full versions of all three movies as shown on Swedish television.  I said I was not going to watch the American remake.  I am glad I changed my mind.  I will not go into a lengthy review comparing the movies but I will say if you have not seen it, do so.  You won't regret it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I watched this mini series last night and I was so disappointed when it was finished. Story is amazing in developing the characters, their personal growth, and the struggles and progress towards a modern future.<br /><br />I think I fell in love with Mr. Thornton. He's a man of morals and righteousness. He's such a contrast to the other men in his station because his own struggle to get to the position where he is today. He's a man who respects his employees even though he sometimes struggles to see them as equals. But he knows that their happiness and ideas are the key to his success and their livelihood.<br /><br />Can't help but adore Ms. Margret Hale. She's somewhat naive but of pure heart and good intentions. She struggles not to place judgment on the methods on the North but learns that there's much to be learned from them. After the loss of her mother and father she finds out that she has to let go of the South and its blissful ignorance. And in doing so, she finds love.<br /><br />And then you Nicholas. A man who gives voice to those of the lower class in society. He's a honorable man who does not want to take advantage of the wealthy but fights to be given the chance to work hard, earn fair wages, and be respected as men. And he wants to dispel the belief that the lower class of society are uneducated savages. He fights with non-violence and smart strategies. Throughout the movie you can't help but root for him.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the movie and really want to see more like it.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|After all the waiting, what a true disappointment! Seems that no skill is needed. More like playing pinball and it was also very short. Sure hope the next one is better.
145210655X|3.0|I agree with the other reviewer. This is an adorable concept, but I'm not sure it's worth a whole book. Most of the comics take about 1 second to look at and absorb. Some of them are pretty funny, such as Luke trying to get cookies from the top shelf using the force. However, few of them are really memorable. Overall, 3.5 stars.

B004AYCWY4|5.0|In this book Dawkins shows the massive amounts of evidence for evolution. Very Very easy to understand. I was skeptical to the idea of evolution before reading this book. But after happily finishing it, I have no doubt in my head everything on this planet evolved. Dont take my word for it. Make your own decision after reading this book and seeing what the evidence says. I doubt anybody with common sense will doubt the fact of evolution after reading this book!

0618918248|5.0|This work is stunningly interesting to read. Anyone who encounters the weightless arguments from creationists should read this book - It will equip you to argue all of them intelligently. It will enlighten you to lots of evidence that suggest god probably does not exist. Dawkins style is very entertaining. With the way he describes things, I find it hard to believe anybody with a brain in their head not to have doubts about the \\"surveillance camera in the sky\\" after reading this book. I highly recommend this book to both believers and non-believers alike.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I do not usually read books set in an Utopian society. I first read this because it was assigned reading in school. Since then I have read the book I read over and over again. The characters are strong. The messages are strong. It would make an amazing movie.

0375704027|4.0|The Japanese have a word for sentimentality for one's past-- natsukashi. It's full-blown nostalgia for everything that has happened, both good and bad. It means remembering everything, not as it was, but as one would like to remember it. Americans young love, innocence lost, and undying relationships. The Japanese have natsukashi.<br /><br />Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood is about a man named Toru Watanabe, who begins looking back and reflecting on his life when he hears the Beatles' song \\"Norwegian Wood\\" while on an airplane. From the very first pages of this novel, Watanabe's sense of life, love, and loss is clear and present-- as is his natsukashi. Toru has suffered a lot.<br /><br />The writing in this novel is perhaps the most flowery writing of Murakami's career (at least-- of the books/stories I've read by him). From the get-go, it is clear that Murakami isn't building an exact replication of the real world, but instead, a dreamy, emotional narrative. The tone of this book is the type that makes you want to curl up next to a fire place with a blanket and cry for what you have lost.<br /><br />Noticeably absent from this novel is Murakami's signature surreal, magical occurences. In some ways, I believe, this novel is almost based on Murakami's life ( I know *parts* of it are). I don't necesarily mean that everything in this novel happened to Murakami, but I feel that the emotional part of it-- the way Toru responds to his past-- the natsukashi-- is real and true.<br /><br />And that honest integrity is flowing throughout this novel. The pages breathe life and truth. There are no conveniences or contrived plot points. The text is genuine, something I cannot say of most novels these days.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, due to the accuracy of a real world atmosphere, parts of this novel drag. It never gets to the point of ridiculousness, however. The pacing just adds to the mood of warm, restful, relaxed. IT's just that, about 3/4 of the way through the book, the plot looses a lot of steam. It eventually gains parts of that back, but it never fully recovers.<br /><br />Even with the slight pacing problems, this is still a fantastic story. If you're emotional, then know that this is a sad book. Not sad like a Nicholas Sparks novel or a best-selling Mitch Albom book instead, the sadness and emotion in this book is something much more profound, much deeper. And that's part of the theme, that there are differences in emotions, opinions, memories. But the important part is how we respond to them-- that natsukashi-- that keeps us going each and every day.k, the plot looses a lot of steam.

1423101499|5.0|... but it just keeps getting better and better!<br /><br />The Battle of the Labyrinth by Rick Riordan is the fourth volume in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. And it is the best yet! Action, revelations, character development, everything. In this book, all the characters continue to develop along their paths, and the series grows up a bit.<br /><br />In this entry, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are shocked to discover that there is an entrance to *the* world-famous labyrinth, hidden right there in Camp Half Blood. Due to some outside circumstances, the trio's talents are required to enter the Labyrinth and fight their way to meet Daedalus for some help.<br /><br />I don't like to spoil much when reviewing series books, but let me just say that new characters are introduced (Rachel Elizabeth Dare, anyone?) and some of the adult-ey, romance aspects are played it up. But this book still holds on to the series roots while growing off into different directions.<br /><br />Riordan's writing is always humorous and witty, and he has again captured the voices of *all* the characters. Like the great series writers past, Riordan has a strong ensemble cast and uses them all deftly and appropriately, without getting too confusing or contrived.<br /><br />What's so great about these books is that they truly can be enjoyed by all ages. Meaning: I'm 17, I love the whole series. My little brother, 13, was pleased by them as well. And I can tell that I wouldn't mind re-reading them all in the near future, either.<br /><br />Although this could have fallen victim to Two-Towers \\"middle-of-the-series\\" syndrome, it doesn't. Plot lines are introduced, resolved, and, like I mentioned earlier, the conflict is deepening again. Riordan is taking a universal battle-- good vs. evil-- and zooming in on it to cover finer themes of love, loss, and growing up. And it works.<br /><br />Obviously if you've read this far in the series, you're going to continue with the fabulous [[ASIN:1423101472 The Last Olympian (Percy Jackson & the Olympians, Book 5)]], which ties with this one for the best book in the series.

0425221806|3.0|Although a good read, Koontz could have cut out about 1/4 of the text content to make for a more taut thriller -- one that raced without interruption towards a breathless ending, rather than being sidetracked innumerable times by issues and scenarios that, for the most part, seemed unimportant.<br /><br />I also had a bit of a problem with the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" that should be part of any sci-fi read. Because the plot setting was so ordinary, I had a hard time convincing myself that the events that played out could have actually happened.<br /><br />Anticipating a blockbuster conclusion, I was sorely disappointed. The book ended with more of a whimper than a bang.<br /><br />Still, I would recommend this as an engaging read, albeit one that stretches the bounds of credulity a bit much.
B000AP04L0|4.0|I haven't seen this movie since I was young. I think high school years.

B002VPE1X4|5.0|For $4 bucks, this is hard to beat.  It is well designed:  there are pockets for flattish items both in front of and behind the main compartment.  The neoprene is adequately thick, and the stitching seems solid.  This is ideal for protecting small items while adding very little bulk.  I've already purchased a second one.<br /><br />(As a size reference point, it's a little too snug for instant retrieval of my Panasonic LX5.  It's perfect for protecting that camera while tossed in a larger bag, though).

B001C4CI8U|3.0|Fringe Season 1 is a campy-clich&eacute;d concoction of sci-fi, horror and conspiracy theories. The show lacks the brainpower and the highly ominous atmosphere of The X-Files, but with each chapter, it has developed its own...personality. Just keep in mind to suspend your disbelief *before* firing up the DVD - I mean, KICK your disbelief out the door and lock tight. It might help you deal with questions along the line of \\"They're not seriously transferring that unintubated critical patient to the mad scientist lab?\\", or \\"Did Walter just say he was inserting that big-pointy-plug into Agent Dunham's BRAINSTEM?\\", or \\"Isn't that long, long blond hair going to interfere with the raiding?\\", or simply, \\"HUH?!\\"<br />So, yeah. Where was I?<br />The FBI, apparently, has a Fringe Division, dealing with all sorts of weird stuff that falls within the territory of fringe science. Agent Olivia Dunham mostly takes point in the investigations. She answers to tough, Senior-Agent-In-Charge Broyles. The team also includes Agent Charlie Francis, mad fringe-scientist Dr. Water Bishop, Agent/lab assistant Astrid, and Walter's son, Peter Bishop. Each chapter has its own plot, while a common plot thread involving parallel universes unites the entire series.<br />I really like Walter.<br />And, oh, don't watch the liquid-brains episode right BEFORE or AFTER having ingested any sort of food.<br />Will I watch the second season? Yup.

B000MV8ABS|5.0|When writer/director/producer/editor Don Coscarelli made a little film by the name of \\"Phantasm\\" in the late `70s, little did he realize that he was creating a cult-classic, let alone one that would spawn a series which would endure for multiple decades.  Somehow, with a minimal budget of $300,000, Coscarelli managed to make the wildly imaginative film stand out from other films at the time while at the same time holding up over the years.  The film is a true testament to the power of independent horror films and what happens when a creative mind is allowed to run free. Studio executives who don't know how to bank on anything other than remakes and sequels should really watch the film and take notes.<br /><br />Mike and his older brother Jody are left to fend for themselves in the wake of their parents' passing, which puts a particular strain on Mike who has a nagging fear of separation. His instincts are correct, as Jody plans on sending him away to live with his aunt so he can perhaps have more time to play guitar on his porch with the local ice cream man, Reggie. Such fears are cast aside quickly, however, when it is discovered that the mysterious Tall Man at the local cemetery is repurposing dead bodies as dwarf slaves in an effort to take over the world. \\"Huh?\\" You may say. \\"Huh?\\" is right.<br /><br />While it certainly isn't a film for everyone, \\"Phantasm\\" gets by with enough bizarre visuals, jarring violence and broad concepts to reel in even the most cynical of horror fans. It also helps that the film is packed with loveable characters brought to life by charming actors. Michael Baldwin (of no relation to 30 Rock's Alec Baldwin) plays the young Mike Pearson, while Reggie Bannister (who could pass as a doppelganger for 30 Rock's Scott Adsit) plays Reggie the ice cream man. Likewise, Bill Thornbury (Sorry, 30 Rock reference not found, please try again later) brings big brother Jody to life with a likeable quality that almost makes you forget you're watching characters in a movie. Then of course there's the great Angus Scrimm as the Tall Man. This single bit of casting almost serves as the linchpin of the whole film. Scrimm's stage presence combined with his uber-creepy vibe is a big part of what makes \\"Phantasm\\" work.<br /><br />Like something straight out of a dream journal, \\"Phantasm\\" is completely out of this world and off-the-wall.  Despite its lofty ambitions, the film works. Not only is it as creepy as anything you'll see, it's also gruesome and genuinely tense. This is of course balanced well with its characters who you will certainly want to follow in the adventures of the next three films (here's hoping for a \\"Phantasm V\\" while everyone's still young). It's a film that works on multiple levels and as time goes on, it seems to be holding up even better than before. \\"Phantasm\\" isn't a nightmare so much as it is a dream come true.aracters in a movie.

0307592731|4.0|It had to have been a shock to 26-year-old Cheryl Strayed to realize she couldn't lift her backpack one inch off the floor mere minutes before commencing on a two-month wilderness hike. She found a way to crawl into her backpack and struggle to her feet. And thus began Strayed's wilderness adventure. The ultra-heavy backpack (including a surplus of condoms) was the first of many harsh reckonings on her 1,100-mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail from Mojave, Calif., to Cascade Locks, Oregon, a town that borders Washington state.<br /><br />Though Strayed had lived in what she called pioneer conditions, she had never actually attempted backpack trekking, much less trekking up and down any of the nine mountain ranges that lay before her. She persisted, facing down isolation in remote regions, high elevations, extreme temperatures, hunger, thirst and times when bears and men became threats to her safety. Add to that a coming to terms with her own sexuality. And to heap yet more misery onto her burden, add the utter agony of horrible boots and torment of water purification equipment that barely worked. She lost not just one boot over the edge of a cliff but gave up six toenails to boot abuse. Then there were the rattlers, warning her off just in time.<br /><br />By the end, Strayed had acquired a hard-earned trail name: Queen of the PCT. She was one of the few female solo hikers in 1995 to tackle such a long stretch of the trail. And we have touched only on the physical challenges. Strayed took to the trail a messy lot of problems having nothing to do with over-packing or exhaustion. She had just divorced a man she loved, she had been sexually promiscuous, she had lost her beloved 45-year-old mother and was struggling to make sense of the loss, she had become enamored of heroin taken in all forms and she was looking for answers.<br /><br />\\"I'd set out to hike the trail so that I could reflect upon my life, to think about everything that had broken me and make myself whole again,\\" she wrote. But, she goes on, \\"I was consumed only with my most immediate and physical suffering.\\" And though the suffering doesn't lessen considerably as she becomes conditioned and acclimated, she does experience a process of letting go that includes a deeper, more accurate understanding of herself. She started out as a woman \\"with a hole in her heart\\" and by the time she reaches Crater Lake at the halfway point in her journey, she could draw parallels between that caldera -- a mountaintop gutted by a cataclysmic volcanic eruption; \\"a mountain that's had its very heart removed\\" -- and her own broken heart. It was then that she contemplated some of her mother's last words: \\"I never got to be in the driver's seat of my own life.\\" A long wilderness solo trek with 2 cents in your pocket and bad boots and surprise bear encounters ensures that's not going to happen to Strayed.<br /><br />`Strayed,' by the way, is a name she gave herself. She responded to associations with \\"stray\\" and \\"orphan.\\" But there are lots of upbeat moments in this book, too. There are moments of \\"trail magic,\\" where a kind of spiritual euphoria takes hold at the grandeur and beauty of the surroundings, and there is one erotic adventure that lasts almost two days before she heads back to the trail.<br /><br />At the end of her impressive trek, Strayed uses her last two dollars to buy herself an ice cream cone. An attorney greets her and says, \\"It's an honor to meet you at this momentous juncture.\\" So true. It took Strayed 15 years to produce this book, but readers will no doubt feel that it's an honor to be given this carefully considered and very well executed story of hardship and growth and terrific adventure. In the end, she delivers up many thank yous to the universe as she realizes that not all reckonings have to be precisely articulated. A thank you back to Strayed for articulating so much of interest and value. She writes, \\"How wild it was, to let it be.\\" Perfect.le again,\\" she wrote.

0812974611|4.0|Robert Harris did a very good job researching day to day life in and around Pompeii around the time Mount Vesuvius erupted. Toward the very beginning of the book, you hear of sulfur in the area's water supply, and then a blockage in the aqueduct, and the aquarius (aqueduct engineer) spends most of the book trying to figure out what went wrong with the aqueduct. I knew as reader, but the characters did not know, that sulfur in the water supply is a sign of an upcoming volcanic eruption.<br /><br />I visited the Pompeii site several years ago, and ever since I have always wondered what it would have been like to have actually been in Pompeii almost 2000 years ago when the volcano erupted. When reading this book I really felt like I was there. Robert Harris did a very good job making you feel like you were there with everybody during the eruption.<br /><br />I did deduct one star because in my opinion it took too long to get to the actual eruption. The first about 2/3-3/4 of the book was devoted to the aquarius trying to figure out what was happening to the water supply, and the last 1/4-1/3 was the actual eruption. I know some readers enjoy the build up like that, and some authors like creating it, but I thought it was too much buildup with not much going on.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to others.

0385534639|4.0|Reading this book gave me a little bit of hope that Amazon's compilation of \\"Best Books of 2011\\" actually has some books worth reading - after reading a few others on their list, I wasn't sure.<br /><br />This book was fun, imaginative, and whimsical. I felt pulled into another world, one where wonder and magic are par for the course. The setting and fantastical elements are perfectly done - not too ridiculous, but not too serious either. The plot and characters kept me interested throughout, with just enough foreshadowing to leave me guessing as to what would happen next. The story moves forward slowly and persistently, leaving you enough time to savor the imagery and beauty of the prose.<br /><br />Some have compared this to Harry Potter. I don't see the similarities (other than the use of magic, obviously), but this is just as enjoyable in its own ways. I felt the world the author created was more similar to that found in this book: [[ASIN:0765356155 Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell: A Novel]]. The world of The Night Circus is not nearly so detailed as the world of Jonathan Strange (Jonathan Strange seemed like a book centered around a magical world with the plot being secondary whereas Night Circus was exactly the opposite), but they have a similar feel to them.<br /><br />I didn't find anything deep or profound in this book, nothing that made it stand out as an amazing piece of literature. It is not destined to become a classic. But it was a good, fun, easy read - perfect for a relaxing and enjoyable romp through another world.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Twilight Saga and Hunger Games Trilogies. So what's not to love about another great trilogy, right?<br /><br />So wrong. (Spoilers ahead)<br /><br />I don't know where to start with my critique, there so many areas to cover. I stopped reading at about page 130. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Let's start by saying that the writer E.L. James is British and chose to make her characters American. In my opinion, she fails miserably at this. I heard British accents in my head while reading because Americans (for the most part) don't speak in the manner in which she wrote. All these, \\"We shall drink tonight to celebrate\\" and very formal ways of speaking. The heroine hates coffee but loves her English Breakfast Tea. And her love of British classic authors. She should have made her characters British, I found this very annoying.<br /><br />Then how about how the heroine prefaces every swear word with a \\"Holy\\"? Did E.L. James not have an editor? If so, they need to be fired. Horrible. Just say the curse word lady, and leave off the \\"Holy\\". Or the amounts of \\"Oh My...\\" the heroine says, sometimes 3 times to page. And how both the main characters apparently \\"Gasp\\" a lot. Bad, bad writing.<br /><br />Now...onto the so called romance?? This is not that. It's just straight up erotica and that's fine if that's your thing. Instead of watching a porno, you're reading one. I'm actually judging all the people who love this book simply because \\"it's hot\\"...not a good enough reason for me to care about the characters or finish reading it. At 22 she's supposedly beautiful but she's never been kissed, gotten an alcohol buzz, or done much of anything. I'm sorry, but unless it's for religious reasons or she suffered some sort of abuse, I'm not buying it. Then to want to jump right into an S & M relationship and do whatever makes him happy and be at his beck and call to please him? She supposedly saved herself for this, simply because he's sexy??? Talk about low self-esteem. Total nonsense.<br /><br />So no, I couldn't continue reading. I think the movie will be better for sure on this one.

1612130283|1.0|I got this book to see what all the hype was about, and reading it actually just left me baffled as to why it's so popular. After reading the entire book I learned that it started as Twilight fan fiction- I just kept thinking it was an absurd ripoff. Like Twilight, it takes place in Washington/Oregon (an area the British author is obviously totally unfamiliar with and didn't bother to research prior to writing an entire trilogy and choosing it as the setting). The main character is Ana; like Bella, she is dark-haired, pale, clumsy, shy, quiet, unaware of her own beauty. She meets Christian, who like Edward is unbelievably beautiful, rich, and sophisticated. How could he possibly be interested in plain little Ana?? Of course he is- all men in Ana's life are, but she is unaware of it. They are wildly attracted to one another despite their differences. He warns her to stay away but they just can't keep apart and so embark on a cheesy, sickening love affair that consists of a lot of gasping, lip-biting, and blushing. And emailing. Lots and lots of emailing. Nothing is kinkier or wilder than the mundane emails of two vapid idiots. The sex is supposed to be craaaaazy kinky and wild but is mostly just regular sex with some light bondage and spanking. Seriously, the kinkiest scenes involve explicit period sex and Christian trying to finger Ana while at dinner with his parents. Both those scenarios strike me as odd rather than kinky. In fact, if you asked me to describe things that are NOT sexy, I might say period sex and getting fingered in front of my boyfriend's parents.  Neither character is well-developed or particularly interesting; Christian just looks amused a lot and calls Ana \\"Ms. Steele\\" (this shows how genteel and old-fashioned he is, despite being kinky), Ana pretty much just agrees with whatever he says and bites her lip constantly. And I do mean CONSTANTLY. It REALLY turns Crazy Kinkster Christian on when Ana bites her lip, so he's constantly \\"growling\\" at herto stop. Yep, he growls a lot- oh yeah, sexaaaay! Ana also constantly \\"peeks up\\" at Christian. And once again, I do mean constantly. She peeks up, peers up through her lashes, blinks up, grins impishly up- even when they are side by side in bed or across a table from each other, she still peeks up at him. Is she a hunchback?? A midget?? Why is she constantly peeking up at him like a baby playing peekaboo? Other reviewers have commented heavily on the repetitiveness of the writing so I won't be repetitive myself by going over it all again, but suffice it to say, the writing is VERY repetitive. I'm not a regular reader of erotica but am fairly certain you could find it a lot better written than this. The sex scenes are repetitive and gratuitous; what might have been sexy once grows tiresome the 20th or so time. It also might be sexier if Ana didn't frequently say \\"holy moly\\" and \\"holy cow\\" to herself during the sex scenes,and maybe if she were a big enough girl to refer to her vagina as such, rather than \\"down there\\". This seems like a thirteen-year old's idea of sexy and risque.I'd skip it if you have pretty much anything else to read.

B005DKLPQ0|4.0|I love the Smiths. Obviously. I cannot imagine anyone who is a partial fan of the band really thinking to themselves that they need to purchase an entire boxset of Smiths music. I say this because I feel that I need to preface this entire review by stating that I am reviewing this product as much as the music that is contained within the box.<br />Musically, well, this is all good. Or it's as good as you remember it. Johnny Marr had a direct hand in the remastering of these records and they all sound great, especially the groups self titled debut which sounds miles better here than tit did on my original CD version. Though most of the times I tend not to like remastering all that much, this one is done pretty well. The sound is opened up slightly and the bass is a little more distinctive, which is a definite plus because the Smiths have one of the most underrated rythym sections ever.<br />The records are slightly different to US listeners since they are based around the original UK Rough Trade releases. This might bother some people who want it to be replicas of what they already have, but it doesn't really bother me all that much. You also get for the first time on these shores \\"The World Won't Listen\\", which is nice to have even if I tend to go back and just listen to \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" out of habit.<br />The packaging is strong though not flawless. The box itself is sturdy and sit nicely on my bookshelf and is attractive. The CD's themselves are in replicas of the original LP's. This leads to many of the lyrics being difficult to read which also might be a problem for some people.<br />And that leads me to the biggest fault I have with this record: the liner notes. Lyrics are only printed on the replica LP sleeves and not included in the stunningly short booklet, which includes a two page essay on the band and some basic catalog information on the band. It would have been nice to see the lyrics reprinted, some more pictures of the band, and surely they could have found someone to write something about the impact of the Smiths or a more detailed history.<br />But for the price, if you are a Smiths fan or know someone who is, then this is a product well worth seeking out. The sound is great, and it is attractive. Even if it's not quite all that it could have been it is certainly still a worthy addition to your Smiths collection.ve found someone to write something about the impact of the Smiths or a more detailed history.<br />But for the price, if you are a Smiths fan or know someone who is, then this is a product well worth seeking out.

WHY?<br /><br />Well to answer that, I saw the last episode of these anime series and was like glued to the t.v.<br />This was one of the most intriguing anime series i've watched and liked. I liked it so much that when i found out there was an artbook for it, i wanted to get it. AND it was in HARDCOVER. you don't get that often with some artbooks that get published these days.

0439023483|4.0|Sports stores around Northern California are sold out of archery supplies. Store clerks said The Hunger Games were behind the surging enthusiasm for the sport. I had to find out why!<br /><br />This young adult story's theme is that goodness can stand up to evil. You may not prevail but you can survive without stooping to the same level of savagery as your opponent.<br /><br />Protagonist Katness Everdeen, a mid-teens female, is admirably developed as a character early in the story. Her family is poor; her father dead from a mine accident. She is smart, quiet yet assertive and courageous. She is a skilled archer and small game hunter willing to break the law by hunting and gathering in the off-limits forest to feed her mother and younger sister. Other characters are not so well developed. Those close to her who survive get more attention than those opposed who die in the Hunger Games. Even though this is unsatisfying to some readers it may be intentional on the author's part to avoid having to kill off characters with whom the target audience (young adult) has bonded.<br /><br />The basic conflict is between a central government (the Capitol) and 12 provinces (the Districts) that lost a war with the Capitol. This too is not well developed. There is insufficient background given to explain their source of power other than references to various technologies they employ to catch you out if you are a \\"traitor.\\" Their enforcers (\\"Peacekeepers\\") are corrupt. Peacekeepers prefer to turn a blind eye to the protagonist's illegal hunting in exchange for the opportunity to buy a squirrel or rabbit for their table. Seems food is scarce for everyone outside the Capitol.<br /><br />From a technical point of view the book has quite a few literary flaws. Yet it is \\"a page turner\\" for those of us interested in entertainment. I like the personality conflicts and relationships in any story to be believable, even when a large stretch of imagination is required (e.g. Tolkein). Most of this book meets those criteria until you get close to the end, when some scary fantasy creatures inexplicably appear out of nowhere. Before that event everything that happens seems possible in a real world of the future.<br /><br />I am torn between 3 and 4 stars for this book. In the end, because it was a good read and fun, I give it four.his book meets those criteria until you get close to the end, when some scary fantasy creatures inexplicably appear out of nowhere.

What a shame that something like this is what young women are reading to spice up their lives!  Ladies, wake up and get a life!
B00004T9VY|5.0|I have this album, but needed the CD. What a great collection of songs, it really brings back fond memories
B007MNV5WU|2.0|This game started out fantastic until I realized I got through the whole game for the first time in roughly an hour. I paid three times the price I had for any previouse version of the game and two worlds is all you get. (Don't release a product before it is finished).  If you are used to the old versions that takes days to complete all levels you will be totally dissapointed. Honestly I just came away feeling ripped off.<br />PS I gave it two stars because what little of the game is there, is fun.
B002BWP49C|5.0|this was the perfect addition to my growing Twilight library...love the series. I can always count on Amazon to have what I need(want)
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is great. The blade is solid and fits in the sheeth very tight, the knife will not fall out. I did put a tek lok belt loop on it and cary it scout style. Holds a grerat edge and well worth the money. I will have this knife for a long time, if not for life. Fast shipping and good packaging.
B007PBKG5G|3.0|Every time I hear the single, \\"Hold On,\\" I think that Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Down on the Corner\\" is about to play.  Furthermore, I'm a little disappointed when it doesn't.  However, with that being said, \\"Boys and Girls\\" is not a bad album by any means yet it's not a great album either.  Instead it's a throwback and an amalgam of many other great bands and artists that have already been mentioned in previous reviews.  So, after a couple of listens this is the record you'll throw on in the background when you don't want to pay attention to what you're listening to yet don't want complete silence either.<br />Their music isn't different or new per se, it's just not the music that's currently being played on the radio.  It's delightfully retro with a late sixties rock sound (ahem, Creedence, ahem), though with a little bit more control and maturity the singer could totally ditch the band and have something potentially unique that would set her apart from the artists she obviously pays homage.<br />Overall, I think the Alabama Shakes are a bar band with pop/rock sensibilities that will fade away because I don't think they can make a second record that will garner any interest. Once their fifteen minutes of almost fame is up I think they'll continue to be a great bar band, but beyond that there's nothing really special about this album aside from the fact that it's different from what's currently played on radio. Now if they can invent a time machine and travel back to the mid to late sixties they'll have a career and not just a segment on VH1's One Hit Wonders 2010s Edition.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|05/2015 UPDATE:<br /><br />This bag has finally reached it's limit.  One of the shoulder straps has started to separate from the top of the bag.  This bag served me well (since 2011).  I recently bought a Lowepro fastpack...and I'm finding it wanting in terms of size.  The Lowepro doesn't accommodate like the amazon does.  The most I carried in the amazon was a D7000 body, 24-70 f/2.8, 70-200 f/2.8, 35 f/1.8, and charger.  Even though mine is coming apart, I would still recommend it with 5 stars simply because of its function, durability, and cost value.  As an amateur or enthusiast, you will not make a mistake with this bag.<br /><br />SOLID camera bag.<br /><br />Excellent value.<br /><br />If you want to trek the jungle, swim the creek, use it as a seat, eat off it, burn it, run over it with a car, recover it from a building demolition...look elsewhere...and pay more money.  The video reviews are accurate.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I really love this game it's a great time killer when work is slow or you're just bored at home.
0143119680|5.0|I started reading this book because Amazon suggested it based on my previous reading tastes (All things supernatural and post-apocalyptic).  As soon as I started it I was instantly hooked and became more and more involved with the characters.  All the details and locations that the author takes you to are so vivid and easy to imagine.  It's full of romance, adventure, mystery and supernatural beings, what's not to love?!  I stopped talking to my coworkers and husband, because all I wanted to do was continue to read this book!  When I got to the end of the book there were so many loose ends I ran around the house screaming \\"What?! THAT'S IT!  YOU'RE KIDDING ME!!\\".  My husband laughed and proceeded to inform me that this was the first of a trilogy and relief swept over me.  :)  Now the only problem is going to be waiting for the other books to be released.  I CAN'T WAIT!!!

B004J4WNL2|5.0|In a world were exuberance, fast-talking and charisma is highly valued one-third of the population is introverted.  Introverts prefer small groups or solitude, are better listeners than speakers and tend to be labeled as quiet or shy.  Cain looks at a number of introverts throughout history and points out how their quite style has contributed greatly to society.  In the second half of the book she looks at psychology and neuroscience to reveal further differences between extroverts and introverts.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a very interesting book.  As an introvert I often feel undervalued because I prefer quiet and solitude.  I thought Cain's explanations about the differences in personality were spot on and well researched.  I think this would be a valuable book for managers, professionals and parents.

B0067LXQAW|5.0|If you are fan of The Cranberries or the 90's music, you will like this album, the sound is nice and fresh, is the Cranberries sound with a little of modernism.<br />Is what music should sound and not the brainless noise that is so mainstream.
6304163029|5.0|I'm to old to use these letters but OMG! What an amazing video. Bonnie Raitt, Buddy Guy, BB King, Robert Cray, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Vaughn all doing a tribute playing Stevie Ray Vaughn songs. Each performer doing their own rendition of a Stevie song. I ordered it in VHS by accident and now need to purchase it in a DVD. The last two songs are all the entertainers on stage together doing Six Strings Down which will bring a tear to your eye. Followed by Tick Toc with all the performers still on stage with each star coming forward playing lead. A star studded show playing song's of one of the greatest musicians that has touched our lives.
0545265355|5.0|I really enjoyed this Trilogy. Just finished the third book a couple of days ago and was pleased with the ending. My interest was held throughout the entire Trilogy and I would recommend this to anyone.
B0059XTUXQ|1.0|I can't believe the callousness the Production Companies exercised making this film. It's an insult to Mrs. Thatcher as a person and as the greatest Prime Minister of our times. If it wasn't for Meryl Streep and her superb impersonation, this movie would have been doomed to failure. If they had any sensibility and compassion they would not have portrayed her as a senile, hallucinating old woman who talks to her dead husband, which was totally demeaning and hurtful at best.  Granted they touched lightly on her Political life, but unfortunately it came through as part of her hallucinations.<br /> Frankly, I was expecting something more in the line of \\"A Woman Called Golda\\", where Mrs. Thatcher's lifetime of work, her Political career, her numerous challenges, her victories and defeats not to mention the enormous changes she brought to UK would have been portrayed in their glory, without taking away foibles of her humanity. It should just have been a tribute to Thatcher years not the imaginary impressions and conceptions of the production staff, who wouldn't even take the time to research their project properly.  All I can say is when one does a biopic on such a famous person, they should stick to facts and portray what truly was instead of taking artistic license and producing their erroneous notions.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|I knew nothing of the Trilogy, so this was new to me and I was not disappointed in the least.  Fantastic acting by Rooney, great directing, editing and cinematography.  All in all a fantastic thriller.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|The game is great! I just wish it was easier to earn restaurant bucks. A lot of items end up costing real money.
0062082353|2.0|I enjoy reading real-life war stories and this one disturbed me, so much so that this is my first review of a book.  Mr. Kyle has no respect for Iraqi \\"savages\\", particularly their culture and religion, but that's the least of his problems.  He is a bully who belongs to a gang.  The countless bar fights, the \\"choking out\\" of initiates (this is how street gangs \\"jump in\\" new members), putting the Seals before his family (gangs substitute the gang life for family) and even the tattoos are all part of gang ritual.<br /><br />That being said, I'm really happy he is on our side and that he has been supplied the best weaponry on the planet.  I felt sorry for Taya, his wife, as she strives to have a partner, husband and a father to her children while he would rather go back to battle than hold his newborn son.  I also think he'd rather have a bar fight and have his SEAL buddies jump into the melee than relate to his wife and he would rather be a \\"bad ass\\" (how many time did he refer to himself with this term?) than a father.  How many bar fights does one need to establish his bona fides?<br /><br />The two most recent books which I read before this were [[ASIN:1400064163 Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption]] and [[ASIN:0061988359 Lost in Shangri-La: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II (P.S.)]].  Save your money on \\"American Sniper\\", instead buy one of these inspiring books.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great freaking game as far as mini village games go. glad its not a slow build game. fantastic in almost every way.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three of these books! I am so sad that they are over! I wish that the epilogue that James adds at the end would have been longer, or possibly write another book from Fifty's POV. This book still had the typical bdsm, not as bad though, there was definitely more drama in this one, with some twists that surprised me. Great read, all three were a great read!!

B005SIATR8|5.0|Although Feist came to fame in 2005, she officially made her debut in 1999. Her debut \\"Monarch (Lay Your Jewelled Head Down)\\" was a self-released album that had garnered a little attention. That same year, she ended up working alongside electronic musician Peaches. A little while later, she became part of the ensemble group Broken Social Scene, where she appeared on their 2002 album \\"You Forgot It In People\\". From there, she collaborated with the producer Chilly Gonzales on a project that eventually became her sophomore effort- and major label debut \\"Let It Die\\". The album was critically acclaimed for its jazz leanings- despite the fact that nearly half of the album were cover songs. She then followed it up with her next recording \\"The Reminder\\" in which she went into a more folk oriented direction. Surprisingly, the album became a big hit after the song \\"1,2,3,4\\" appeared in a commercial. However, she lost interest in making music and stopped recording for a couple of years. She returned to the studio and emerged with her first album in four years- the fourth in her career \\"Metals\\".<br /><br />On this new recording, she is joined by longtime producers and collaborators Dominic \\"Mocky\\" Salole and Chilly Gonzales. This time around, her new album sounds polished and very much like a successor to \\"The Reminder\\". She starts off the album with the folky ballad about a fighting couple \\"The Bad In Each Other\\". She sings of deceased family members on the acoustic driven \\"Graveyard\\" and sings of of sailing at night on \\"Caught A Long Wind\\". Feist also points to signs of an inevitable breakup on the first single \\"How Come You Never Go There\\" as well as the haunting \\"A Commotion\\" and on \\"The Circle Married The Line\\". She also makes it a point not to go back to a past relationship on \\"Bittersweet Melodies\\" and tells of a woman's acceptance of losing love on \\"Anti-Pioneer\\". The album closes out with the acoustic ballad \\"Get It Wrong Get It Right\\". Most of the songs on \\"Metals\\" deal with the subject of break-ups and heartache, so the album has overall theme of sadness. Despite the melancholic undertones of the record, Feist makes another great album in her extensive body of work.al with the subject of break-ups and heartache, so the album has overall theme of sadness.

0439023521|5.0|I read this of course after watching the blockbuster movie of the same name. While reading it, it felt like a whole different story. The reason because there a lot of elements in the book that was left out of the movie, including some differences. I heavily enjoyed the book as much as I did the movie even though I dont care much for these types of stories. Plus it felt more detailed then the movie itself. Of course the book came first but I enjoyed it more for the fact I saw the movie first.<br /><br />There a lot of plot twist that gave the book suspense. We learn more about the backstories of the characters. I would suggest seeing the movie first and then read the book. The reason is because if you do the other way around, you will feel like the movie wasnt a whole as much if you read the book second.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great book<br />-Featured a lot of different things not in the movie<br />-Very detailed<br />-Plot twist<br /><br />Cons:<br />-None

0345803485|3.0|I surreeee wish the people who recommended this book would have warned me about its insanely graphic nature! Lawdy! I felt dirty reading this with children...scratch that.. I felt dirty reading this with ANYONE in the room! I shut my iPad so fast, so many times. But I finished it! This is a trashy romance novel on steroids... You have been warned.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love it but it will say no internet even when connected so it won't let me go to other villages also it won't let md watch the &quot;movie&quot; at the theater.  It is awesome just needs the kinks worked out!!!
0399159029|5.0|Phillip Kerr's latest Bernie Gunther novel, Prague Fatale, is a very much welcome addition to the Bernie Gunther series.  For those new to the series, Bernie Gunther is a cop, a detective.  But he isn't just any detective. He's a Berliner and he has been working the streets from the days of the Weimar Republic on through to the regime of Adolf Hitler.  Like most `hard-boiled' detectives, Gunther likes to toe his own line and has a fierce independent streak.  Of course independence is not a prized attribute in Nazi Germany if you want to make it until your next birthday.  As a result, he has made his own comprises, compromises that render him at time close to suicidally depressed.  But he carries on.<br /><br />Prague Fatale is mostly set, no surprise, in Prague.  Gunther has been called to Prague by none other then Reinhard Heydrich, one of the architects of the Holocaust, serving in Prague as the Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia.  He was a butcher to be sure but, unlike the Eichmanns of the regime who may rightfully fall under Hannah Arendt's \\"banality of evil\\" umbrella, Heydrich was in many respects cultured and sophisticated.  Heydrich, getting ready to celebrate his arrival in Prague commands Gunther, who he has run into in previous books in the series, to serve as a bodyguard and general house detective.  No sooner does Gunther arrive than the murder of a high-ranking adjutant takes place.  It is an old-fashioned locked-door scenario.  The book follows Gunther as he walks through the maze of intrigue and deceit surrounding the murder.<br /><br />Although the book is very well-plotted and suspenseful, I think Kerr exceeds in the characterization of Gunther and the players in these dramas.  Kerr acknowledges Gunther's complicity in the system but manages to leave the reader with no small amount of sympathy for the choices Gunther has had to make.  Clearly one could argue that Gunther suffers from the guilt of surviving and Kerr makes good use of it.<br /><br />Prague Fatale was one of the more enjoyable books in the series.  I think it stands up on its own, but I think the new reader will be well-served by picking up some of the earlier books in the series first.  Either way, I can only say: highly recommended.<br /><br />L. Fleisig

B007R21JJK|5.0|built my first computer in over a decade this weekend using this mobo. I could not be happier.<br /><br />Very well laid out and the new mobo material is really stiff and rugged feeling.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Purported to be able to download to Kindle, but doesn't happen. Disappointed.  Have seen it on Droid phones and really enjoyed it, but it didn't work for me on a Kindle Fire.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I'd like to start out by stating that I, like many other readers, thought the first two books in this series were fantastic. So I'd really like to know what happened to the author once the third book was started? I feel as though she got bored with the story and couldn't come up with anything to keep us on the edge like we had been while reading The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.<br /><br />  This third and final book dealt too much with the minor details and skipped right over the crucial moments. Introducing too many new characters just brought on so much confusion that it was hard to keep up with the writing. The story could have flourished and, like the first two, satisfied us. Instead she spends so much time spewing out every detail about characters that are going to be killed off in about 20 pages, anyway.<br /><br />  I understand that this book is supposed to show us how much a war can affect our lives and the people around us, but this book is meant for young adults and should focus less on the gory details and more on tying up loose ends at the end of the novel. If war can change a person so much then why did Katniss end up exactly where everybody knew she would?<br /><br />  I was happy when she ends up with Peeta.. like everyone else. He tugged at my heart strings from the very beginning and I think it was a huge mistake to have him trying to kill Katniss in one scene to ending with their picture-perfect marriage on another with no explanation whatsoever. The fact that Gale is just tossed aside at the end of the novel makes me hate the protagonist all the more. If the friendship the author worked so hard on maintaining can't sustain a minor setback then it shouldn't have been so prominent in the first books.<br /><br />  If you liked the first books, and you are like me, you will read this conclusion to the trilogy. And you will be very disappointed, like me.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|Personally this is the best science fiction series of all. While most os the sci-fi series are worried about graphics and special effects, this series focuses more on the complexity of the characters, with amazing detailed and non stop drama. The actors are amazingly well selected, the soundtrack is epical, the non stop tension during each show, all the ingredients for a perfect tv series, even if you are not a sci-fi fan.<br /><br />The blu-ray edition is a giant step forward, the improvement on video and audio are definitely worth it!!! The perfect way to collect and enjoy this master piece.
B004EPZ0AC|4.0|I took my 11-year-old daughter to see this during Thanksgiving (2011) break. We argued about whether to see this or The Muppet Movie. She won. We both loved HF1 and she thought this was just as good. I bought the DVD to accompany HF1 and I also sprung for the Muppets while I was at it.
B0043M4OTE|4.0|Enjoyed 80% of the book.  Like being able to go back and see into the past.  Did not like the romance in the book.  Do not care for those details.  Could have been left out.  Not for younger than 18 eyes.
044024367X|3.0|I'm having a hard time with some of the low reviews of this book (one and two stars). This was clearly not Lee Child's best book -- in fact, it's easily the weakest I've read, and I've read all of the recent ones and all but a few of the early ones. But Lee Child on a bad day is still a far better writer than most, and this was absolutely no one star book. I've read a lot of books by a lot of authors, including many in this genre, and many are far worse. This book was still above average at worst, maybe well above average. I think Lee Child is still the best author out there for novels of this type.<br /><br />If you are a Lee Child fan, I think you can still read this book with confidence that you won't be wasting your time. If you are just starting out with Lee Child, don't start with this one.<br /><br />The issues that I had with this book are the same as most of the other reviews. The plot was bizarre, the commentary was overly politicized and preachy, and the pace was ploddingly slow and repetitive. But it still contained all of the usual Jack Reacher elements, and it was still a decent read. If Lee Child's other novels were this \\"bad,\\" he'd still be one of my favorite authors.
0743277708|4.0|Watership Down is a great book and worth reading or giving to your kid over the age of 10.  Just like The Hobbit (which this book reminded me of) there are several characters that get hurt and/or killed.  If you like fantasy adventure books then this book is for you.  I am not sure why I did not read it before.  I am looking forward to when my kid is older so I can share it with him.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Such hype and tv buildup that I couldn't wait to read this first book.  Well, it was a hugh disappointment!  Clearly, a first novel for Ms. James and I have no intention of getting the next 2.<br /><br />The relationship was not believable after the first few days of being with Christian.<br /><br />Although the book was said to be \\"HOT\\" it was boring after the first few encounters!!! Same old stuff and unless you are int S&M no love or sweet happiness to be even imagined.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not much to say about this book except that it is completely as-advertised. It's a tautly-paced YA novel that is un-put-downable. I'm eager to start the next one.<br /><br />I have a few weird reservations. First and foremost, I hated how one-dimensional Effie Trinket and Haymitch were. They were introduced almost as comic relief, and I found that a little cheapening. Also, I realize that it's a YA novel, but the sexlessness of it was a little off to me. I would think that teen pregnancy would be an issue in an impoverished town and that this would weigh in somehow on the Games. Can a girl compete if she's with child? Katniss eventually concedes that the idea of ever raising children is highly distasteful to her, but I would think that's the exception rather than the rule. Not a big deal, but something that could have been addressed slightly more thoroughly? (Perhaps childbirth is forbidden to anyone below tribute age. See, I cleared the whole thing up in a single sentence.)
B004KX5KQC|4.0|Personally i dont like Nick Cave. i have heard most of his albums and i find him extremely boring and i feel pessimistic feelings after hearing his music. Well this is an album that i really like. It has amazing songs like: Do you love me 1+ 2 - Nobody's babe now - Loverman (The best song on this album) - Red Right Hand ( The most famous songs - i remember hearing it in Scream 1 movie). The songs are very rhythmic with a mystical atmosphere and a very good variety of musical organs. The production is amazing and i really like the way the guitars in these songs sounds. If you like gothic or atmospheric metal and rock then buy this album and you wont regret it. For me it is by far his best album.

0385738765|5.0|My 13 year-old devoured this book as well as the Maze Runner. He's reading the last of the trilogy and completely enjoys it. He's a fan of the Hunger Games and he says it definitely falls into that same category. . .The book arrived very fast; earlier than expected.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|katy's album Teenage Dream was a big succes, and katy herself felt that the teenage dream chapter wasn't ended yet because there were 3 songs that didn't make it to end up on the record, so she made the complete confection. it's a must have for katycats or people who just like katy. i love that katy said that this isn't her 3th record, but a extensive version of teenage dream.<br /><br />it's definitily worth your money !

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I watched the movies first, admittedly a bandwagon-joiner. I found the book to be well written with a fantastic pacing. Their is violence in there, but not so over the top as to be distracting. Intimate scenes are sparingly written so as not to be too embarassing (something I greatly appreciated as a dad!!) The rage against the system theme is prevalent enough to notice, but not as overbearing as say.... Ayn Rand or Terry Pratchett.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this book for kids from 12 up. The ending leads me to believe that this will be a series. I imagine I will be pre-ordering as soon as it's available. Congratulation Ms. Collins!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was a little hesitant to read this book having heard how brutal it was.  But, I got past the brutality and enjoyed the story.  I liked it so much, I've starrted reading the sequal, \\"Catching Fire\\", and like it as well.<br />Sunny

1451629184|5.0|I absolutely love this sling. My puppy tends to follow me around wherever I go and so now I can carry him around in the sling and keep him close to me which he loves as he's super affectionate. It also helps when I am doing my house chores. He can see what I'm doing not feel left out. It also less bulky than the carry case we have so when I take him to the store or to the mall its really easy and quicker. He is super comfortable in it and now jumps straight into when its time to go. If you love to keep you puppy close, this is the product for you :-).
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I absolutely loved this game the first few days I played it. Within the first week though, the game ceased to work. When I opened the app I would get one of three results:<br />1) The game would get stuck on the learning company logo and I would have to restart my Kindle<br />2) The game would close out as soon as it opened.<br />3) The game would load, but all my buildings, plants and animals would have a time of 200-300+ hours until they could be collected. This was on things that should only take minutes at longest.<br />I even uninstalled the game from my device and tried to redownload it, but still got the same results.<br />If they patch the game to fix this glitch, I would change my rating to 5 stars, because it really is a great game. Unfortunately, right now it is a game that I cannot play.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've had moments as a book reviewer where I was unsure how to rate a book. Wool Omnibus by Hugh Howey is my easiest 5 star rating since A Game of Thrones.  This book was five star, without a doubt. There is so much to like about it, but I think my favorite aspect is the philosophical gems that Hugh interjects through each character's voice. This unique aspect of Hugh's style allowed me to see them as more than just real people, but a representation of humanity. This aspect of his style fits perfectly with Wool's theme of survival. Some characters believed segregation, hidden truths, and murder were the key to survival, while others believed the exact opposite. Part of what makes this story feel so real is the diversity of perspectives on what is absolutely necessary to survive in such a life or death scenario. Seeing what humanity would be like on the brink of extinction helped make me question what I'm doing to help those around me survive, or if I'm only interested in my own.<br /><br />Hugh's unbiased narration keeps the reader on their toes because either side could reasonably succeed. Hugh adeptly portrayed each character's struggle to survive in a way that made me root for them, put myself in their shoes, and experience their emotions as they fought to survive. Even his antagonist is sympathetic. No spoilers here, but Hugh makes a strong case for this character's motivation. Hugh does a great job of raising the stakes, interlacing conflict, and surprising the reader at every turn. Hugh's writing is as rare a gem as his characters, and is diverse enough to appeal to anyone who wants to know what it feels like to hope in the midst of overwhelming doubt.
0345803485|5.0|This book as well as the 2nd and 3rd consumed me its all I did for a week. Not only is this trilogy a GREAT romance its also a great suspense. I would recommend these books to anyone! I am now a huge fan of E.L James!!! I couldn't put this book down! Ive never read a romance beforeso wasn't sure what I would think of it. I always teased my mom for reading romance novels! Lol!!

0525478817|5.0|Well I just finished the book and I don't think I'm quite ready to write a review yet but I'm going to go for it anyways because I don't want to forget anything. The Fault In Our Stars is a story about a girl named Hazel who has Lung cancer I'm pretty sure it is. Well she goes to a support group for cancer patients. This support group is where she meets the love of her life Augustus Waters. Now normally I don't fall for guys in books right away and if i do I don't stay in love with them but this boy I fell for and didn't lost the feeling throughout the whole book. This book I swear was so amazing and heartbreaking. Near the end I didn't want to keep reading i had to keep putting it down to compose myself and not because it was bad but because it was so sad.<br /><br />Hazel has had cancer most of her life and she knows she is dying. She doesn't know when she'll die because she has her good days and then her bad but she knows she will at some point. She is such an inspirational character all the way because she's so strong even when her life was fading away. She decides to let Augustus into her life because she knows that he loves her and that she loves in.<br /><br />Augustus is a very smart, and also inspiring young man. He also got cancer when he was very young and he lost his leg. Luckily though when we met him he was cancer free. He fell for Hazel as soon as he laid eyes on her which mad me fall for him. He knew that at the time she would probably die first but he accepted it and he was there for her until he couldn't be anymore.<br /><br />The two of them loved this book so much that ended randomly and they wanted to find out what happened. Together Hazel & Gus tracked down this author, using Gus's cancer wish and they fly to visit him for answers. I won't tell you what happened on that trip because of spillers but I will say jus before they left Hazel got some very bad news but in the end the two of them dealt with it together as best they could until they couldn't any longer. They were both very strong up until the end.<br /><br />I give this inspirational story 5 out of 5 stars because it kept you turning pages until you couldn't anymore. It reached out and grabbed you before you even finished the first sentence of the first page. I must say i'm extremely glad that The Fault In Our Stars was my pick for my first John Green book. I hope to read more by him in the very near future.ldn't any longer. They were both very strong up until the end.<br /><br />I give this inspirational story 5 out of 5 stars because it kept you turning pages until you couldn't anymore.

0553801503|2.0|After the first three books I was expecting a lot from George R.R. Martin.  In the first three books of his series he managed to make characters that were interesting, felt real, and continuously added to the overall story while expanding the plot in ways that no one could have expected.  While there were a few minor side plots going on he managed to keep them in check and keep the main story at the front.  All of that suddenly changes in this book.  The first big change is that there are at least a dozen annoying minor characters who each get one or two point of view chapters.  These chapters, for the most part, go absolutely no where.  They seem to exist only to expand the universe of the books and add absolutely nothing to the main storyline.  Oh, and about that main storyline, where is it?? Did it get buried under the mountain of insignificant and pointless character side stories?  There are only a few chapters concerning the Lannisters at King's Landing, Little Finger & Sansa at the Vale, and the people of the North.  As for the rest of the focus characters - Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon, Bran etc. they just completely vanish and don't get any mention.<br /><br />This book does have some redeeming qualities:<br /><br />While it is a major disappointment in context (fourth book in a series), it is a decent book by itself.  Most of the minor characters and their side plots are fairly enjoyable.  The chapters devoted to the Iron Islands and its inhabitants would make a great short novel on their own, as would Brienne's travels through Westeros.  Just pretend you're reading a companion book to the series, that may make it more enjoyable.<br /><br />The few chapters that you do get about Cersei, Jaime, Sansa, and Little Finger are outstanding.  They are probably some of the best chapters in the entire series.  They're also the only part of this book that adds to the main storyline.<br /><br />Still, I would not recommend this book to anyone.  I was so disappointed in it that I've quit the series and will not bother with Dance With Dragons.  If you're just now starting Game of Thrones I would recommend reading the first three books and then just stopping.  Pretend Stannis and the Lannisters have decided to split Westeros evenly and rule over both portions separately or whatever you can imagine and move on to something better.  If you're a bit of a masochist though and still want to continue with the series I would recommend just reading a summary of this book and then skipping on to the 5th one.<br /><br />(Excuse the bad grammar, I'm still annoyed after spending one incredibly long week on this book)
B007BVOF8E|2.0|The plot involves the hunt for a highly placed Soviet spy at the top of the British intelligence service (the circus).  George Smiley, former number 2 at the circus loses his job following a disastrous operation in eastern Europe.  He is secretly re-hired later to uncover the identity of the Soviet spy.<br /><br />Although the film makers deserve credit for trying, it simply is not possible to do justice to le Carre's incredibly detailed and nuanced story in 2+ hours.  We know that the Soviet spy must be one of four men who run the circus.  Unfortunately, there is no time to give them any kind of back story or character development.  When the spy is discovered, we know as much about these men as we did in the beginning; that is, almost nothing.<br /><br />A spy procedural with no action sequences must rely on character, mood and details of the spycraft to tell a good story.  There is plenty of mood in this film, but it comes at the expense of everything else.  Massive amounts of story detail are thrown around, seemingly at random, without any explanation for their significance.<br /><br />Le Carre's novel remains one of the best spy stories ever written.  This movie sacrifices far too much detail in trying to condense the story down to movie length.  My recommendation is to watch the 6 hour BBC miniseries with Alec Guinness.  It remains the definitive film version of Tinker, Tailor.

The Mission: Impossible franchise has run the gauntlet as far as successes and failures go; I thoroughly enjoy the original Mission: Impossible, I despise the sequel, and I'm relatively indifferent to the third film aside from its fantastic villain in the form of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  The franchise returns to the screen five years after M:I-3 and an entire fifteen years after the original hit theaters in May of 1996.  After the somewhat disappointing box office returns for M:I-3 and the lackluster performance of Cruise's Knight and Day there was talk of Tom Cruises's days as an action star being over.  Ghost Protocol proved to be just the boost Cruise's career needed as M:I-4 went on to be the most successful film in the franchise so far.<br /><br />Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol isn't my favorite film of the franchise but it is certainly the best of the sequels.<br /><br />While Ghost Protocol is a relatively good film where it really gets to shine is on Blu-ray. It is simply put one of the best demo discs you can add to your collection as it is as close to video and audio perfection as you're about to find.  I can't find one technical flaw with picture quality.  Black levels are inky across the board, flesh tones are accurate, and I spotted no instances of edge enhancement or artifacting even during the tricky sand storm sequence which could have been a disaster.<br /><br />My only gripe with the video presentation of M:I-4 has nothing to do with the actual disc released, which again is fabulous, but concerns the fact that there isn't even an option to purchase a version of Ghost Protocol that includes the astonishing IMAX footage.  After the success of releasing The Dark Knight, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and Tron: Legacy with their IMAX footage intact I'm dumbfounded by the studio and director Brad Bird's decision not to at least give fans a choice to purchase an IMAX version.  The advertising for the theatrical release of Ghost Protocol leaned heavily on the IMAX footage angle and received a lot of praise critically especially for the Burj Khalifa tower sequence which was edge gripping to say the least.  The lack of IMAX footage obviously didn't affect my score of Ghost Protocol but it's still disappointing that the nearly 30 minutes of IMAX footage was unceremoniously left out.<br /><br />Like the video transfer the 7.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is also demo worthy.  From as soon as the Paramount mountain disappears the audio assault begins; gun shots, explosions, car crashes, and everything in between will give your surround speakers and subwoofer a real workout.  Not only does the track come alive during the many action sequences but even during the calmer moments the track is full of subtlety and precision.  The revamped theme sounds better than ever, the Dubai dust storm is an auditory tour de force, and the fight scenes pack plenty of punch no pun intended.  Even with all the action the dialogue is always crystal clear and the front sound stage is well balanced.  Ghost Protocol simply sounds amazing; even with the volume turned up high it never gets out of control and you shouldn't have to fidget with the volume level at all.<br /><br />The special features included on this release are a little light surprisingly with all the extras being found on the main disc with the second disc being a DVD copy of the film.  An UltraViolet Digital Copy & a normal Digital Copy are also housed on the DVD copy.  Four  HD documentaries of varying length are included; Heating Up in Dubai (17 min), Vancouver Fisticuffs (12 min), The Sandstorm (3 min), and Props (3 min).  Also included are 15 minutes of Deleted Scenes with optional commentary with Director Brad Bird also presented in HD.  Strangely there is no feature commentary with Brad Bird which seems like a glaring omission.<br /><br />This newest entry into the Mission: Impossible franchise is the best film of the franchise since the original but is easily the best Blu-ray of the series.  The included special features are a little light but that can be overlooked because of the amazing video and audio presentation which is flawless.  Inclusion of the IMAX footage would have been a nice bonus; I simply don't understand why it wasn't included but perhaps a future Blu-ray release will include it.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to enjoy Tom Cruise's best film in almost a decade before he \\"self destructs\\" again.ttle light surprisingly with all the extras being found on the main disc with the second disc being a DVD copy of the film.

B000PMLFRA|2.0|I was so excited to get this for all the obvious reasons. The quality of the video (and I don't know any of the technical details about transfers or saturation, I just know it looks good), is pretty awesome, and the audio is outstanding. However, as I started watching and then I realized that there were no bonus materials other than audio commentary. I looked in the box, hoping to find more cd's in there but there were none. Just the three blurays for each one of the films. No bonus materials, nothing, zero, nada! So, befuddled beyond measure, I went on bluray.com and found out that there was no mistake. The original trilogy HAS NO BONUS MATERIALS WHATSOEVER. If you want the juicy stuff (like the casting auditions, deleted scenes, etc.) you MUST buy the complete box set with the 6 movies (that is, the original trilogy AND the newer trilogy). Very disappointing. Shame on Lucas and shame on me for thinking Lucas has a soul.[[ASIN:B000PMLFRA Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]]]

B007UQRW62|5.0|Now, I'm going to be honest: this is technically not a review of the set itself, though I will discuss it. This is more of a review for the film itself, Singing in the Rain, which is one of my favorites. The film stars the absolutely superb Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood, a silent Hollywood star who is sucked into the advent of sound films along with his partner, Cosmo Brown, played by Donald O'Connor. Their is just one problem: Don's leading lady Lina Lamont, whom he despises, has the voice of a thousand cats screeching at the top of their lungs. A miracle appears in the form of Kathy Selden, the love interest, who has a beautiful voice and dubs Lina's dialogue, but when Lina hears that the studio wants to replace her with Kathy, she brings up her contract, which prevents the studio from doing such a thing. It's a classic conflict, and it leads to a wonderful plot, but the real show is the music. Along with the classic \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" routine, there is also \\"Good Morning,\\" \\"All I do is Dream of You,\\" and my favorite, \\"Make 'em Laugh!\\" Gene Kelly was a notorious perfectionist, making Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) dance until her feet bled, due to her inability to dance, but it was worth it (mostly) to see some of the most spectacular dancing and singing in film, nostalgic of the old days when showmanship was all that mattered. The only flaw I can find is the \\"Dancing Cavalier\\" sequence, which sets up the plot for the film they were making. It is a bit too long in the tooth (30 minutes), even if it is spectacularly staged. A minor complaint, though, that doesn't detract from an amazing film. The film itself gets a five out of five. Now, onto the extras. From what I can see, it has the usual: documentaries, deleted scenes and outtakes, production stills, trailers, and, not surprisingly, a  small collectible umbrella (GET IT?). It all seems well and good, even above and beyond, but what I'm excited for is the transfer. This is the first time it's on Blu-Ray (that I'm awareof), and, this being a very visual and colorful film, I am excited to see how they spruced it up. So, overall, if you haven't seen the film, or want to have the ultimate experience with the film, then pick this up, because you do not want to miss this classic.<br /><br />EDIT 4/27/12: I just found out that the film has been marked up to the original 80 dollar price, so I'd like to point out I wrote this when it was only around 50 dollars, which I though was pretty good for a great film and nice extras. Still, $80 is a bit much, so I'm going to say, if you haven't seen the film, or are on a budget, WAIT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BLU RAY RELEASE! If you have seen the film, then perhaps get this when it is cheaper, because the extras seem really nice.
B000SEFNMS|1.0|This is a terrible book and waste of money! Half of the book is about the author's dysfunctional life, and the rest glorifies a messed up kid who did something stupid. And paid the ultimate price. There wasn't half enough of a story to write a book about, so the author threw in his life too.....DON'T waste your money on this book......
B00068V384|5.0|Be it warranted or otherwise, it seems impossible to review one of Ingrid Haebler's performances without using the word `ladylike' at some point or other: it's a dreadfully unfair epithet. Similarly, is it possible to comment on a Celibidache recording without using a word that is an antonym of `Fast'? Let's see!<br /><br />Conceptually at least, this is a Requiem whose eschatology is less concerned with Death, Resurrection and Judgement in a Christian sense and more to do with the Bhagavad Gita: I am Became Death, the Destroyer of Worlds. There is little in way of consolation here: even the Recordare is a cistern of darkness and the Benedictus is restrained. On a stylistic level, this performance is diametrically opposed to the likes of Jeggy, Savall, Hogwood, Christie and Sperring, all of whom are in my collection. One could almost declare it is actually beyond Romantic in its grandeur and span of gestures. In the absence of a performance from Klemperer, it is sui generis (and that's assuming such a comparison is valid). Listen to Celi's Dies Irae: mere velocity is not synonymous with visceral excitement and this is thrilling beyond measure. More widely, Celi spurns a Karajan-style homogenisation throughout to give the orchestra full rein; consequently, the introduction of the Requiem Aeternam and the Confutatis are mesmerising in their detail. Speaking of which, I have always thought that a `continental shelf' exists in the Requiem: the opening six movements were penned by a Mozart at the height of his powers who was grateful for the commission: but come the Confutatis and Lachrymosa, a different game is afoot: the composer is staring oblivion in the face. It is one of the strengths of this performance that Celi recognises this demarcation and responds accordingly: the choir excel themselves in the Confutatis and the Munich Philharmonic, at one with the conductor, do justice to the serrated figurations for the strings. Wow.<br /><br />One could aver there is insufficient contrast to the movements: the one tempo largely prevails (for instance, the Rex Tremendae Majestatis would benefit from greater impetus); if you are allergic or immune to Celi's wizardry, dormition beckons.  Those of us who are somewhat jaded by 626-itis and are open to the ministrations of the Hair Gel Warrior will be galvanised by this overhaul of a masterpiece.<br /><br />The soloists are somewhat squally (the women) or lacking in resonance and projection (the men) but are concert-grade nevertheless. The recording is pretty damned good - just listen to the Dies Irae. The five stars here is an approximation. I don't often reach for this disc but I would not want to be without it. And whenever I listen to it, it has my full attention.<br /><br />And yes, it is s . . . . s . . . .  snail-like. Not that it matters.fficient contrast to the movements: the one tempo largely prevails (for instance, the Rex Tremendae Majestatis would benefit from greater impetus); if you are allergic or immune to Celi's wizardry, dormition beckons.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Its perfect it lets me know whether I should wear a short soever shirt or a long sleeve or shorts pants cspris or a skirt.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Even though I had read the book I was not able to stop watching the beginning of this saga.  The actors are great, the costumes, sets and cinematography are top notch.  The only thing  some might find disturbing is amount of nudity, but don't be put off the story is so complex and the tale will capture your imagination.  I absolutely can not wait for season 2 to come out as I do not have access to the original airing.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I absolutely love, love this show. I have the first and second season now and that just leaves the third. It is one of those shows you will watch over and over and it is still as funny as the first time!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a lot of different games give it some variety. the kids like playing it and trying to open the locked games
B006OKOZGU|5.0|I had waited for this movie to come out on Blu-ray and it was worth the wait. I found the color's to be very bright with very good picture quality. Amazon had a great price for it so picked it up along with some other movies.
B005F6NA56|5.0|Outstanding album that will keep the songs running in your head.  It grows and grows on you.  This album should be a candidate for multiple awards.
B005HESLNW|5.0|I can't believe Captain Jean Luc Picard pulled the race card!!! LMFAO! I guess that makes Data the new black!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I'm not sure whether to review the book itself or the story.  The book was used, considered in very good condition, which it was.  It was mailed in a timely manner.  I also recommend the story and the author.
B005HET2L2|5.0|I'm beginning to think Riker is the only awesome character in this show. Picard is always either snapping at somebody, which is amusing, or having some crisis of character. Data is retarded. Jordy is a nerd. I want to slap troy every time she opens her stupid mouth, and wesley is weak. This episode and the episode Riker was offered a place in the Q continuum are the only two episodes so far that are worthy of even being rated.
0345803485|1.0|Wow....just wow. I was looking for an Anais Nin of the modern age and found...God knows what. I just don't see why so many people are wild about this book--I can barely make my way through it the writing is so bad and the heroine so unbelievable. If I didn't find myself laughing over the sophomoric dialogue I wouldn't be getting any enjoyment out of this.<br /><br />The billionaire (yes, he's perfect in everyway) begins his seduction....she's prepared to leave her virginity behind, he's just flown her to his luxurious home in Seattle (In a helicopter?!?!? Across the entire state of Washington), the reader knows, with the subtly of a frying pan to the head, that the debauchery is about to begin only to be hit with ridicules dialoque such as the following:<br /><br />\\"I don't make love, I f*** hard....I want to show you my playroom.\\"<br /><br />\\"You want to play on your xBox?\\"<br /><br />Somehow the most niave girl on the face of planet Earth has tempted this billionaire with her ability to fall on her face at every turn...have a drunken tequila night which ends in her vomiting outside of a club...and her exquisite grasp of the phrases \\"Oh Jeeze..\\" \\"Oh Crap...\\" and an inability to refer to her girlish bits as anything but \\"...down there...\\" But at least she usually wear her \\"best jeans\\" while doing it.<br /><br />Subtle and sophisticated erotica this is not--this is the \\"literary\\" version of a porn mag. You don't read it for the story...
1401300529|5.0|It was suggested I read this book for a graduate history course I was taking. I can understand some of the negative comments from veterans and amateur historians who feel slighted that the book does not cover the full war experience/years. However, David Halberstam was a brilliant writer. The book is essentially about cutting down General MacArthur, who was seemingly a legend in his own mind. The way Halberstam writes made me crave for more and more information. Likewise, Halberstam was trying to show the mindset of politicians , and how that mindset crippled them fifteen years later in Vietnam. I just found the book fascinating.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|a lot like mario games :) I am happy to say my kids love it and its easy enough for my 3 year old to control.
0345803485|2.0|If my review were based solely on the books literary merits, I would have given it 1 star but there is no denying that E.L. James writes a great erotic sex scene, so if that is your reason for reading this book - go for it.  Her prose, however, is next to awful and the plot offends.  Why would a handsome charasmatic rich man spend so much time and energy trying to convert a \\"vanilla\\" to BDSM?  Is it even possible to find a college educated woman who doesn't smoke, has never been drunk, and is a virgin who has barely had a kiss?  This plot offends on many levels.  A young woman, Anastasia Steele, is seduced by a dominating wealthy man, Christian Grey, who barks, growls, threatens, scowls, and scolds - yuck!  The man's proclivities are explained by his damaged childhood.  So does the author also believe that an abusive mother makes a man gay?  Sex is sex.  What turns a person on in the bedroom doesn't need to be explained.  I'd guess 99% of women/men enjoy light bondage and playful spanking.  A significant percentage might enjoy more intense bondage or discipline and only a minority of those people had abusive childhoods. Because Christian Gray expresses his childhood abuse though his actions towards women, Anastasia should run for the hills not try to save his damaged soul.  The idea that a woman can save a man - yuck!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm very happy with this app. It's accuret and I'm very happy it can be put on my sd card!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love, Love Fifty Shades Trilogy!! I am reading it a 2nd time. I hope Ms. E.L. James writes about Christen Gray side of the story... I would like to read about what is in his mind... But all and all it is a HOT HOT story...
B006H3MIV8|5.0|Better than expected! And, I might add that it's about time Bob takes the title 'The Bard' from Shakespeare. Will is a somewhat swell writer but Bob in shear volume alone has outwritten Bill many records ago. Also, a good way to hear how great Bob Dylan songs are, is to hear them interpreted by other artists. This CD does it magificently.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|This is a great movie inspiring people to have dreams and work hard for them. Also, great way to learn basics of golf
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I cant find any directions, but its easy enough to figure out ....very addicting... I recommend this game. the only reason I did not give 5 stars is the games cost too many points too unlock.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|An inspiring story told in this documentary. The way the music helps the storyline is amazing. It is a must see for everyone who has a soul.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Despite the poor reviews I enjoyed reading this book.  I missed all of the main characters from the previous books but there were just enough chapters to keep me reminded that these other chapters (of lesser characters or new up and coming main characters) are needed to tell the entire story.  To provide back ground or more information to the things that have been suggested in the previous books.  This is quite the epic tale and I am just now starting book 5 and am taking my time because it will be a few years before book 6 is released.<br /><br />So read this one with a grain of salt, it won't be as page turning at the others but you will feel satisfied when finished.  Its like the bread during the meal, needed to wipe up the juices and completely fill your belly.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Cool game. Not as good graphics as tiny I suppose, but I love the whole ice age concept. :)  I will be playing this a lot just like I play tiny village!!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|For anyone who has not read the books, each movie in the series gets a little darker than the one before.  This movie is darker still.  It shows their struggle and sacrifice.  It can be quite sad, and yet, it is a fantastic movie.<br /><br />I highly suggest watching the entire series and reading the books.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is soooooo much cooler den the regular version. I mean so cool. INSTALLED ALL DA WAY BABI. Omg downland install do wateva just play
0385344228|4.0|Surprise and shock!<br />The book was a little slow in the beginning, but once the trial started I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Awesome surprise ending!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love ice age the movies and even love scratch more his continental crack up is hilarious now its in the little theater awesome
1878424319|5.0|Easy/fast read book, Powerful messages and stories, Very thought provoking. It would be worth rereading. It is a book for anyone, no matter what belief system they may have.
B004Z1896C|5.0|Stumbled upon Rory Gallagher due to Amazon's \\"Customers Who Bought This Also Liked...\\" recommendation.  They were certainly right.  Almost nobody else I know had ever heard of him either (except one friend from Switzerland), though everybody liked him once they heard this CD.  He's right up there with Peter Green, as far as I'm concerned (Rolling Stones Magazine has him ranked as the 57th best guitar player of all time, with Peter Green at 58th).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many games and my little sisters love it! although the coins and stuff is a little bit different. maybe cheaper? but still love it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun for me and my friends to play I love to help animals and I love this movie so much it is so funny and cute
B007SYWFRM|5.0|disney's version of garden of time. Lot's of fun building your ice age village. easy to build up your money supply to builb.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun addicting game. cant stop playing!! I got it for my kids and I play it more than they do.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|great game. it's not hard to exit just go to the menu.  but i don't like how it won't  let you access the kindle controls.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This was as fun as any puzzle game I've played. The game play is intuitive and the difficulty was hard enough to be challenging but not impossible.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|Let me begin by saying as a long time diehard Metallica fan I wasn't sure what to be expecting when I heard the release of this 4 tack EP. With this it featured songs that did not make the final cut for the Death Magnetic tracklist and it amazes me 2 out of four did not make the album. Nonetheless it is the best $5 bucks I've ever spent every song is great the riffs, solos, lyrics are all badass! What really amazed me was the song \\"Rebel of Babylon\\" James sings that with such raw emotion and Kirk has some amazing guitar solos in that song and in \\"Hate Train\\" as well to me those two are the highlights of the EP they should be hits as far as I am concerned. Many people can say what they want about this release that it being a money grab as many have put it or making up for the release of \\"Lulu\\" that got heavenly ridiculed by critics and fans alike. My opinion I believe Metallica wanted to give a little to thier fans and for once let us hear some rare tracks that you wouldnt normally hear I'm glad they did I love it! This is just a taste whats to come from Metallica in the future as they work on their 10th studio album and continue to please us diehard fans and that I say thank you. If you love Metallica you know what to do PICK IT UP!!!! Besides its a great collection of rare unheard bonus tracks from this great band if I had to say even tho these songs wont become hits its still alot better then what you hear nowadays from bands such as... Avenged Sevenfold, Seether, Three Days Grace, Shinedown, Godsmack, and Linkin Park and thats a fact!!!! Lol
B004TTMYQG|5.0|best calendar I found with useful widgets! Works great with Gmail calendar. The main app could use a different color theme, but other than that a wonderful little helper.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Great - does what it says! Highly Recommended! Very helpful and saves time from having to plug it up via USB.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|not useful to me if I get to the store and can't see the grocery list I worked on - glad it was free at least
B00006RAKP|5.0|Great songs and wonderful piano misic.  I listen to it over and over.  I highly recommend this cd.  If you love Elton John you will want this cd.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I am a Baldacci fan and expected this to be a good book.  What I did not expect was this to be one of his best ever!!  I was hooked from the very beginning and could not put it down.  Baldacci almost cannot be matched as far as his writing and he never, ever disappoints.  The book held your attention throughout and the only 'oh, no' is when it is the last page.  Totally worth buying.  If only Mr. Baldacci could write fast and give us more books, that would be just great.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've noticed that Stephen King's books have been hit and miss for awhile now (since his accident, in my opinion). But, since I love the guy's writing and have had many hours of suspense, horror and joy reading his works, I don't let that stop me. This is a good thing, because he did his usual best in this book, 11/22/63.<br /><br />There are, essentially, four and a half significant characters (the half being the Man with the Card). It's a book about time travel, which I don't think spoils anything...it's pretty clear on the cover. Jake Epping takes the bait to win the ultimate game changer and save one of the metaphorical Kings of the 1960s. Based on the potentials and my own high regards for the target, I would have as well. But that is mostly a convoluted backdrop to what makes the book the most interesting to read. What life was like on an every day level in the late 50s and early 60s. The good, the bad and the rest. Mr. King does an excellent job describing the world and it's backdrop, it's viewpoints and quirks. It almost made me wish I could go find my own little hole in time to sneak through. Almost.<br /><br />{SPOILER POTENTIAL}<br />The ending was a bit anti-climatic for my tastes but was not a disappointment, just something that had to happen in some way and did. As I write this, I guess any other option would have been a let-down to a much greater degree...but part of me always wants the Disney ending. Regardless, it still supplied surprises that seemingly had nothing to do with what was going on, but of course, did when you think about it.<br /><br />I ache for George, for that special dance. I fell in love with the clumsy blonde and should be so lucky if she came along in my world. Yes, I was that affected by her.<br /><br />So you Stephen King readers, and fans of a turbulent time in our history, and of time/mystery suspense...trust me when I say that this book is well worth the read. Just give it a little patience in the first few paragraphs, you won't regret it.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. King.n't regret it.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. King.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is so covenant. It picks up where you leave off, book marks,just like the kindle, and surprising it is easy to read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I fell in love with this book from the moment I began to read it. She wastes no time before the mysterious and sexy Mr. Grey captivates your imagination.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is quite honestly the biggest pile of trash I have come across in a long time.  Don't waste your money on this one.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is one of the best ones yet. Keep them coming but maybe they should add a boss to finght.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Book 1 brings more depth to the story than the movie. The movie was very good too. Book 2 is bringing a lot of surprises and sofar is very good reading.
0345803493|5.0|The second book of the \\"Thrill-ogy\\" kept me on the edge of my seat, couldn't put the book down and finished it in less than two days. The author takes you on a journey of heart felt emotions, and makes this novel flow so well that it reads easily. The novel reads with such intensity, that you feel every pang of ache,and every soaring emotion. I cannot wait to open book three tonight !
B0044DE906|4.0|Its a very good novel. I enjoy reading it. I recomend it to everyone who is interested in family issues.
0345803485|5.0|Easy to read, keeps you intranced. I read this book in under 3 days could not put it down. Better book than all the reviews said...read the second book in the series in under two days. I hope to read everything this author produces !
0545305497|4.0|fantastic service, my books arrived within a week and at less then I could go and purchase them from any of my local retailers
B005NN4PPU|5.0|This is such a great album! A friend recommended it to me, and I am so glad he did. There is so much soul and emotion in the words that it really is a work of art.
1847879071|5.0|Provides a thorough explanation of statistical concepts before using SPSS. Quite often users just use SPSS without understanding what they are looking at or why they are using this function. This puts it all into perspective very simply, succinctly and practically. Uses a lot of examples which is great. Also provides a step by step guide for using SPSS. It is really the best two in one book I've come across - explains stats concepts and then how to use SPSS. I would enrol in Andy Field's classes if he was teaching at a university near me.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|good value, I have no other comments, need 20 works in review to say which is VERY annoying for customers
B0011ZWF6K|5.0|The Last Kind Words has to be the best CD Devildriver has made to date. Solid riffs, vocals are outstanding and just brutal. Recommend to any fan of Devildriver.
B004H4XLR4|1.0|Way of packing is very bad. Is terrible. Have also lost the box, there is a trace like bump somewhere, the first part of Shidore plastic was cracked. I was disappointed. I think so long-distance transport, it is necessary to carefully packing.
B00005JKGO|3.0|\\"all you want is food and bed\\", what a sweet life but niente, not enough for Marcello... and Sylvia's mega ADD scene was noteworthy for cultural references but 1960 and Fellini wanted to have fun and make sure he payed dues for the catholic audience... Steiner and Marcello dialogue on the art review was scripted seemed a miss mash of hackneyed terms BUT provided the only attempt to demand attention to the concepts translated, is Italian that hard to comprehend so higher level constructs could never be appreciated??? \\"My daughter asks who is the mother of the Sun, so adorable..\\" or something to that effect. Not sure why this would hint at the serial killer in him but that kid would annoy me to no end with more of that nonsense, I think Steiner made it up to make us think his life was better, like the abused g/f viewed it... satisfied I hung in there as the end scene was fitting with yet another night of party 'till dawn and Marcello hooks up with the young virgin, what is she doing up that early??  Think I will have to watch another time for ultimate review, but three hours of chasing a high gets mega tedious... Fellini's other work is otherwise most appreciated.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a diverting little game that runs nicely. A more hint function that didn't just solve the puzzle would be a nice addition however.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the last of the Fifty Shades trilogy and I have to say it was my least favorite - but only because I knew it was the end and I wanted more!!  The story ends in a satisfying - sort of fairytale-like ending - which in my opinion is what was needed (this is happy fantasy after all and needs the happy ending).  I recommend this book for those readers who have started this trilogy and love the characters - start at the beginning if you haven't read the other two books yet.
B0058VW36U|5.0|it's soooooo fun!! since their is so many levels in the game you can keep playing it over and over.. but the cut the rope expirements isn't as good as the original game though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was truly captivating!  It wasn't just erotica - it had characters that were developed, interesting and with such tension between them.  I literally had to make myself put it down occasionally just because I wanted it to last!  The sex / bondage scenes were well written and very....ummmm exciting!  I would highly recommend this book if you are looking for something beyond the 'typical' erotica.
0802473156|4.0|I'm not finished reading the book yet, but so far it's great.  I'm not married, but I am in a relationship. Everything in the book makes sense, and is relevant to every day life and situations. My next task will be to get my boyfriend to read it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow book two!  I was so glad there was a book two after I finished the first - I still wanted more!  I think this actually may be a bit more exciting - there is some suspense, relationship tangles and resolutions, and of course more steam!  If you enjoyed the first book you should check out this one too!
1423140591|5.0|Okay...so I liked the Percy Jackson series just fine but it wasn't my favorite so when I got to this series I figured I would give it a shot and aren't I glad I did! The Second in a series that brings the best from the Greek side of things and adds a whole other Roman side is just...well...AMAZING!  The new friends that we have coming in and the new enemies just suck you in and personally I think I like the Roman aspect a lot more then the Greeks and so this book brings that to the forefront since we finally get to the Roman camp and our new friends are the best and brightest of those! New battles with new tricks and lots and lots of action that brings laughter and tears....I'm just so amazed!
B00634GHJA|5.0|So many other ways to transfer photos then needing such a large app to do it with. Just takes up a lot of space to do what I could already do.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Well, this is definitely a must see...and you will want to see every little bit so this edition is great because you have everything from extended scenes to deleted scenes and much much more!  Avatar is one of my favorite movies and if you want to see were the movie industry can take us now with all the coolest gadgets and gizmos then here is your movie...Enjoy!
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I was amazed and pleased with series 1, especially how close it followed the book. I base this review on the first 4 episodes of series 2. As others have already pointed out that HBO  took some liberties with the source material and added scenes that were not even mentioned  in the book and changed some characters completely mostly to titillate the audience. It is still a great show, however I wish they would stay true to the original story. I just reread the 2nd book again and it is pretty clear in my memory. (SPOILER AHEAD) - nowhere in the book do you find any mention that Lord Renly is gay. Nowhere in the book is any description that Joffrey (as evil as he may be)tortures 2 naked prostitutes - one apparently to death. Arya's escape with the assistance of the black brother does not come to a sudden halt by being captured (and most of them killed) at their first rest stop, as a matter of fact they beat the Lanister's knights back and NOBODY was killed - what happens later is another story. And there are more of these inconsistencies just in the first 4 airings of series 2. The story also gets a bit ahead of itself and I have to agree that viewers who did not read the books might find it confusing to figure out the new characters, which where not already introduced in series 1, since there is no explanation of relationships, different houses, loyalties to one or the other, etc., which might become clear later, but by then a few uninitiated viewers might very well have given up trying to figure it out.<br />All in all I enjoy the series so far - just hope they do not get too far away from the original story - which happened with \\"True Blood\\", which is not recognizable any more in relationship to the books and frankly is getting just awful after a promising start.
142311339X|5.0|Even if the Percy Jackson series wasn't your favorite pick this book up and you wont regret it! The prophecy will be fulfilled and enemy's of old are now allies and friends are more then what they seem in this new tale of Greek mythology.  We get not only the best of this world we saw grow in the Percy Jackson series but we also get introduced to a whole other side of things when we see the Roman aspects of our Greek friends....Flying metal dragons, gods going after gods, and of course in the middle of it three ADHD, lost kids doing there best to get over there perceived weaknesses in time to save the world! Welcome to the 21st century...Riordan style!
B005LAIGPA|5.0|This is a defined 5 star movie. I went and just expected a little action but instead I got a pleasant surprise. This film kept me on the edge of my seat having goosebumps. I couldn't go to sleep about what Matt try's to do to save his brother. It's unbelievable. A definet buy. I promis u it will be worth it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a story about heart, emotional growth and awareness. The author portrays the characters with honesty, humor and insightfulness so rarely seen in books. I fell in love with Christian and cheered on Anastasia in their personal quest for growth, knowledge and love. Without a doubt, one of the most amazing, well written, and well edited (which is important to me) books I have read in a very long time. (By the way, I read anywhere from 80-150 books a year. 8-14 at any given moment) This book made me put the others I was reading on the back burner until I finished it. BDSM doesn't have to be your cup of tea. This book is so much more than that.
B0025KVLU6|2.0|Of course this is one of the greatest albums, but I have problems with vocal tracks missing on several songs. You can faintly hear the track, but this is serious. Very disappointing!

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I had been using DocsToGo.  It is MUCH faster in uploading and downloading the files. I do mean MUCH.<br />Other than that, this is a FAR superior program.<br />The interface is much prettier, and it has access to more remote files.  DocsToGo only works with GoogleDocs. GoogleDocs will not work with password protected files.  Box.net does, and this intergrates perfectly with Box as well as Google.<br />Not only does it interface with them,  it allows access to them from the &quot;recent&quot; files, which DocsToGo does not.<br />I didn't use this for a while because it didn't support formulas in my excel spreadsheets.  Now it does.<br />I wish it had the loading speed of DocsToGo, but it is a FAR superior program.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this for a &quot; real time&quot; game! yes you have the option to spend real money but there is no need to at all. everything fills back up really fast!!  fun little game!!

It's like she's a 12 year old drooling over Justin Bieber.<br />After reading \\"holy whatever\\" for the millionth time I was ready to vomit.<br />I am still reeling over the fact that the author has insulted most women with this crap. I don't care who's into BDSM, it didn't matter. The main characters were at best stupid.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|What a great show!!..I'm enjoying the whole DVD..enjoy the special features and audio commentaries as well..Anxious to get caught up which i won't think will take very long!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Good product, works well, not that expensive.  Bought a more expensive one for my wife, this works just as well.  Would recommend to others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book had a slow start to me but once it hit chapter 5 I was glued. I work at a hospital and I overheard Doctors and Nurses (I was one of them) talking about how good the book was. I'm half way done book 2 and I'm in love with the trilogy. I already ordered book 3. I might get a Kindle because lugging around and iPad is cumbersome......
1609611543|2.0|The highest rated review here convinced me to buy the book because it sounded like just the ticket for myself and some people close to me (that last 10 or 15 lbs miraculously disappears just by removing wheat from the diet!).  OK, I need to lose more than 15 lbs, but this really sounded like \\"the silver bullet\\" -- and so easy.<br /><br />I went on the Belly Fat Cure (another low carb diet) last year and lost 20 lbs over 5 months.  I was very happy with the sense of not dieting, not being hungry, and even the slowness of the weight loss was not disappointing because the inches went too and I didn't have to deal with looking washed-out while becoming slimmer.  However, I refused to go through fresh fruit season without fully enjoying fresh fruit in unlimited quantity (which probably wouldn't have hurt) but that stimulated my sweet tooth and I returned to my bad habits -- but not completely.  I learned from the BFC experience that maybe I wasn't cut out to eat grains; they had always caused me discomfort: I liked eating them, but never felt full, and would eat until I felt like the food was backed up to my throat and still not feel satisfied.  So there seems to be something to this thing about wheat and perhaps all or most grains.  While I was on the BFC, after the sweet tooth cravings went away, I still craved buttered toast -- multi grain bread.  Yet when I was off the diet, I don't eat it anymore, perhaps because I didn't want to feel the discomfort it caused -- same with triscuits, and all the other wheat snacks I used to fill up on -- I hadn't decided to avoid wheat, but can't recall the last time I ate any of those things.  But naturally, I gained back all the weight that I lost.  That should have been my first clue that what this book advertised on the surface: \\"stop eating wheat and all your problems disappear\\" was not quite real.<br /><br />The introduction and first chapter is quite compelling: same thing we've all observed -- all the really FAT people, evenchildren!  How did this happen?  When?  Something did it, and he really makes a case.  Then in the following chapters he gets into too much technical detail that I'm not particularly interested in, and I admit I skimmed a lot to get to the part that tells me what to do -- that's when the scam is revealed.  What he basically says to do is to go on a low carb diet -- which I truly believe in, but I already have several low carb diet books and don't need another and don't need to be fooled into buying one that pretends to be something else.<br /><br />At the same time I purchased this book, I purchased a gluten free cookbook thinking this would get me started on this miracle.  Well, this book tells you NOT to eat any gluten-free products or fruit or other grains (even those gluten free) or beans or legumes, etc.  Like I said, get an old Atkins diet book from a used book store or whatever flavor of low-carb diet you like, it will be more interesting and straightforward and save you money.<br /><br />I would have given him 3 stars because maybe everything he says is true (who knows?) but presenting it as simply wheat elimination, then switching about 200 pages in, so what he's really saying is restrict all kinds of high carbs (which is probably good advice, but I don't need to pay him to tell me, I already paid 3 other authors to tell me over the past 20 years) seems like outright trickery.  Also his hostility towards wheat seems too aggressive resulting in perhaps some exaggerated statements and outlandish remarks like this one starting at the bottom of page 17 \\"...As a result, wheat has undergone a more drastic transformation than Joan Rivers, stretched, sewed, cut, and stitched back together to yield something entirely unique, nearly unrecognizable when compared to the original and yet still called by the same name: wheat.\\"  I find that unnecessarily rude and he loses credibility just like someone who has punctuate his arguments with cuss words.
1451648537|5.0|My livelihood has been in computers and business since 1975, and I've never been an Apple products fan.  After reading this book, I'm not only a believer, but I realize how much I wasted my own life trying to maximize profit and make money rather than great products.  If I could only live the last 40 years over again...
B004SIP9RO|4.0|It's Christmas time in New York and two people reach for the same pair of gloves in the last minute gift-buying rush at Bloomingdale's.  The sparks fly as they spend the evening together, but Sarah (played by Kate Beckinsale) has strong opinions on fate and devises a plan to see if she and Jonathan (played by John Cusack) are really meant to be together.  As you can imagine, things don't go smoothly and both characters spend the next several years apart, but will fate eventually bring them together or was that one night just that, one night?<br /><br />Ms. Beckinsale is totally charming in this movie and Mr. Cusack does an excellent job of being loveable while not being perfect.  Great cast and storyline twists that keep you interested.  A great date movie or any-time movie when in the mood for this type of film.
B001E45XT4|5.0|For the price given, this headset is definitely worth it. It's more than comfortable, and the mic works really well. An awesome headset.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very great game I love it!!!!!!!  the only thing is it sucks down your battery! but I really recommend it I love it a lot
0345803485|1.0|Pee-U. This is the most poorly written book I have ever attempted to read. Couldn't make if past the first chapter. Unbelieveable that people will actually pay for this dreck.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I bought this game and I absolutely love it.....only problem is that ive beat the available stages but there is no new upgrade......I would suggest buying this game in a few months when there is more to it.......but overall the game is a blast!!!! :o))
B002MQYOFW|4.0|My grandchildren have read this series and have given mixed reviews for the movie so decided I'd give the book a try - actually enjoyed the book - fast moving - futuristic as many of the popular 'young adult' novels are - would not want to see the movie - too much violence for me - may actually read the rest of the trilogy.
0553386794|3.0|It is a well-paced book, once you get past the slow beginning.  well written, generally.  there is some humor in the first part, particularly involving Tyrion, the dwarf, but even he becomes very serious as the book moves on.  GRR Martin (ok, just this book, I can't judge the man) is extremely misogynistic, and seems to be writing for a readership of teenaged boys.  I want to see how some of the secondary characters turn out, so I guess I'll get the second book.
1439153663|5.0|Although it dealt with some horrible times in the history of colonial America, telling of the atrocities of the slave period, it made the reader yearn to learn more.  The characters were well developed and the author made the reader feel for them and what they had to go through.  Well written, but sad.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|A Military Sci-Fi novel that draws on Heinlein's Starship troopers. In fact it draws inspiration from several other novels by several authors which Scalzi is very clear about.<br /><br />For me the novel, and in fact the same was true for the second novel and as it seems the third one as well, was about new situations. Sure it's about war, but it's seen through the eyes if a man from a world in much the same level of advancement as ours and when he leaves it's spaceships, star travel and shooting aliens in the face.<br /><br />That said the novel isn't entirely about war and spaceships. It's also about humanity's place in the universe and how this is seen through the eyes of the soldiers. It's also alot about the main characters own situation when faced with this more or less new reality, which I can't really go into without spoilers.<br /><br />All in all, it might not be perfect, but it's close enough to warrant a rank of more than four stars.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|While it is true I naturally had some awareness of the techniques described by Robin Dreeke in 'It's Not All About Me' and naturally used some of them, consciously putting it all together makes a huge difference.<br /><br />After reading the first eight chapters I decided to put the techniques into practice and enjoyed three back to back, one hour, effortless, in depth conversations with two friends and one person I have met once before. This is not something I normally do as I tend to just mind my own business. It was quite amazing to me how much more I uncovered about what these three people knew at it was really interesting stuff.<br /><br />I'm very happy I bought this book (Kindle version). The process Robin describes is simple and effective, the techniques clearly explained with everyday examples, and it's short. In 45 minutes or so you will understand what to do and start getting the benefits. It is fun to practice the techniques and they are genuinely useful for ordinary and professional life.<br /><br />Martin Simson
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have read all of his books and this in my opinion is one of his best yet. I know its a good read when I cry at the end and Nicolas Sparks never fails to deliver.
0143121421|5.0|Like others, I read this book shortly after its initial publication. I was in college. My recollection of the book was not favorable; it was lacking in action. Now, in my 70s, my reread of the book led to a far different reaction. I realize now that as a young man I could not relate to the reflections of older men nearing retirement. Or the experience of people with doubts about the usefulness of their careers or the wisdom of past choices. I heartily recommend this book for the more \\"Mature\\" reader.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|This book I thought was outstanding. It is pretty hard writing a survual book on something people cal fictional. (I believe they are real) This book totally will prepare you with awesom techneques and smart tips. i would recommend this for maybe 11+. After reading this book, also try a sample of the Zombie Survival Guide: Recorded Attacks. The sample is basicly the whole book. After it comes just previews of World War Z and this book.<br /><br />This book was awesome!!!
1400052181|5.0|My son's class was given this book as an assignment for his Biology class and am I glad he suggested I read it as well. As my son and I read this book, I crossed reference with my mother who grew up on those days.<br />This non-fiction story of science and a \\"not so well to do\\" humble African American family is one of the best books I have ever read.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Looks real good but will not load on my device for some reason don't know why. So as far as I'm concerned this sucks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this book. I had just heard things about it and saw the previews for the movie. Now that I've read it and am now almost finished with the third. . . I LOVE THEM!! Great buy and one of my favorites!!
B000URWYTS|5.0|If you liked The Paris Wife you'll love Loving Frank.  Mamah Borthwick's character was masterfully developed based on limited recorded information and creative speculation by author Nancy Horan.  I highly recommend it for its beautiful prose and interesting historical insight.  Along the way you'll learn a lot about Wright and his Prairie Style and the struggle the couple endured.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|PLUM SPOOKY is another great story by Janet Evanovich.<br /><br />Once again, Stephanie Plum is on the hunt for a very weird person.  This time it's a guy named Munch.  Hot and very mysterious Diesel pops up to help, bringing a nice edge to the story, as well as some excellent sexual tension.<br /><br />I laughed my whole way through the book...and I think I now have a crush on Diesel.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|luv it it is a great game never. boring will continue to play this game. Gethsemane entertaineing. I would say so myself
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Yet another attempt to rip off consumers by getting you to pay ungodly amounts of money on virtual coins and nuts to advance further in the game.  What makes these games down right unethical is that they are cartoon games pointed at kids and there is no way to block unwanted purchases!  All games such as this should be banned from app stores! This has been deleted from my device and account.
B000RJW1Y2|3.0|It is fully functional wheel to play racing games, but for the simulation it is too small.<br />The user has a filling driving, but the small size of the wheel keeps a distance from the reality.<br />The wheel and pedals functionality is satisfactory; making the wheel size bigger would convince me to offer 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I prefer this game cause.you.don't have to download.a lot only.one game which has.many games in it which is 124 best app I have seen that holds that.many games in it
0385342063|1.0|I am a big fan of Sophie Kinsella's books. Sadly, this one didn't hold up. It reads like a rush job; not much happens and the \\"banter\\" is tedious. Part of the problem is that the premise is clever, but the execution means one character reading texts and emails for the rest of the book. That's not funny and it just doesn't work on the page (or as an audiobook).<br /><br />Part of the problem for me is that her characters are seeming less attractive, too.  Her characters mean well, but they lie -- a lot!  This one lies and also doesn't know how to mind her business.<br /><br />I'll try the next one, but would advise others not to waste money on this book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is great! It makes saving my favorite knitting patterns and recipes that I find online a breeze. Highly recommend!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Fun game. Great time killer.  May consider paying for the additional features although you wont need them to enjoy this game.
B00634GHJA|5.0|this does just what it says. very simple and quick. glad it was free :) but worth $2 in my opinion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thank you Amazon!!  I really did enjoy reading this book.  It was everything that people said it would be and more.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|Having been a fan that started out watching the 3rd season first, I have to say it's a little different how everyone started out. Talk about the modern family of today...and this show pretty much sums it up. You have the father that in his 2nd marriage marries someone younger than his own daughter, his son has a gay partner and raising an Asian baby...that's just the start. It's hilarious - if you're looking for something to take your mind off your own family, take a look at this show. It's definitely worth your time!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I joined The Hunger Games phenomena upon the release of the film. My curiosity got the better of me, wanting to read the book to decide whether to see the movie. Within a few pages I was captivated and often had to force myself to put the book down at night; otherwise I'd be exhausted at work the next day.<br /><br />It is refreshing to have a strong female hero who also possesses a fair number of typical teenage quirks. Growing up as a tomboy I would have relished a character like \\"Katniss\\" to help me understand boys and the ways of the world. Most importantly, as an archer in an era when it wasn't cool or popular, I am delighted to have archery revealed to be a great sport and useful hunting implement, if not survival tool.<br /><br />This book is compelling, well-written and an interesting sociological study of a dystopian society on the brink. The parallels between the \\"Haves\\" and the \\"Have Nots\\" with our own society was truly involving and rather frightening.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a great read, sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The concept of all the games is simple but some of them take a little skill.  I wasn't very far along before updating it so I didn't care too much but if you update, you DO lose all of your progress so keep that in mind.  All in all, it's a good like game playing app to keep for those days when you are bored and have nothing else to do.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this game is extremely AWESOME!!! This game rocks! hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great little puzzle game but super frustrating when you get to stuck on a level and can not figure any possible way out.<br /><br />The only thing that I would add is some sort of hint feature.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|a truly unusual and compelling story, for all young adults and over. It delivers in every way, from the gut wrenching moments to the stark fear, she brings her characters to life.<br /> Even better, as a male, even though the main character is female, it's not a girlie story. Very much readable for anyone, (outside the young children), in fact, as hard as the storyline is, as much as it assaults your senses, it never steps over the line to gross, or unneeded descriptive deaths, yet, the danger and death is there in plenty.<br /> All told, it's a very good book, and well worth the read.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Angry Birds Space adds a whole new level to the Angry Birds challenge!  Applied physics in a video game - AWESOME!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Though it deals with a difficult subject, it felt like a privilege to get a glimpse into Hazel and Gus' relationship. For the reader it was a short time, but for the 2 main characters it was and always will be infinite. John Green said in one of his vlogbrother videos \\"All I could think about, as night fell, was how much you could love made-up people and how much you can miss them.\\" This is how I feel about the two main characters. As I think back to write this review it's impressive that in a relatively short novel, I could feel that I knew someone well and lost them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great game very exciting and there are lots of games to choose from it never gets boring I love it
B0063IH60K|5.0|User friendly. Great graphics. Very engaging &amp; lots of fun.  I have gotten more entertainment from this app than any other I've downloaded!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is the best app ever!I'm going to make my room a replica of it!in fact I'm going to make my house a replica!I will name my cat and all my future kids lep because I love him. he is so cool fighting off all of the ugly creatures and stuff.don't get this app though because its mine. when I get rich I'm going to buy it and own it over all of you. hahahaha!bye luv ya!
0345803485|5.0|This book is hot as hell.  If you don't have an imagination then don't bother picking it up.  This book takes you to another place and makes you believe that a man like this exists.  The author does a great job pulling you into the story.  I love that they *spoiler altert* concentrate on these two and don't mess with their relationship by making a love triangle.  I read all three in a weeks' time and can't wait to read them again.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Wow!  I plowed through the first and most of the second book this weekend, and can easily say this series is cheesier than block of Velveeta.  The storyline is more fantasy than romance:  What girl hasn't dreamed of being swept off her feet by a hot millionaire who can give countless orgasms?  Even better - lining up only 2 interviews and still landing the perfect job right out of college!  My favorite part was when Ana told Christian she was a virgin; I had to laugh out loud at the image of his facepalm.<br /><br />It's only a matter of time before this series is made into a movie starring the smelly guy from Twillight.  Read the books before that happens - they are worth your money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book because of the subject matter (kids fighting kids to the death). I had several friends recommend it before giving in. Boy, am I glad I did. It is so well written. You will find yourself still reading well past your bed time, just to see what happens next!! I haven't read a book this good in a long while. Make sure you have the second book on hand when you finish this one, or you'll be making time to get by the bookstore before work!! My husband and son have both enjoyed it as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game can be challenging for some, but we fond it amazingly fun for all of us. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Just finished watching this movie on streaming, and I couldn't be more pleased. Played to perfection by everyone in the film.  Intelligent, taut, mesmerizing until it builds to the climax.  And the film does stand on its own, without knowing the book or previous series.  The use of light and shadow in the cinematography is astounding and saturates the film with its deep emotion.  It does require close attention and patience, but I'm ready to see it all over again right now.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This app had all of the fun of the original Oregon trail game but there are some serious issues that need to be addressed. Waiting 109 hours for one of my buildings is ridiculous. I am patiently waiting for an update to correct some of these annoying issues. It really is a fun game... But it needs to be fixed!
1401937519|5.0|This book is really amazing! I hear about Anita's story just a few weeks after my Father lost his long battle with the cancer. After watching an interview with Anita on internet I decided to purchase her book. This book really comforted me and I highly recommended it to anybody who just lost their loved one....
B0071R43MG|5.0|Satriani has now released four solo concert films but this is the one that beats them all and is an essential purchase for Satch fans!<br /><br />Clocking in at 2h20, Satch puts in a career-best performance across a carefully balanced set that showcases his latest material from the \\"Wormhole Wizards\\" CD along with the early 90s classics and everything between.<br /><br />The playing is technically astounding but Satch and his band still remain relaxed throughout, engaging the crowd in the intimate venue and allowing room in their performance for some playful improvisation. At times, Joe subtly reinterprets the older material, keeping things fresh with added keyboards and some classy melody / time-signature / tempo changes. It's a fun vibe, and a real collaborative effort - this is a true band performance, giving it their all and having a blast!<br /><br />Production-wise, the blu-ray edition looks and sounds incredible and thankfully the gimmicky production that marred the disappointing \\"Live in Paris\\" has been dropped. The direction on Satchurated is of the highest quality, achieving a great balance between close-up and long-shot that allows you to sit back and enjoy this amazing performance by Joe and his band.<br /><br />Overall, this is a concert-film that meets and exceeds expectations at all levels and should be on every Satch fan's wish-list. Just brilliant!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I knew early on in this book that I would always think of the first one as the best. However I couldn't find many reasons to like this one at all. The two biggest scenes are cut short and confusing to the point that there is no true climax in this book. The author missed a great opportunity to save this book and series but punted and ended it leaving us all feeling unfulfilled. I give it two stars because it is worth reading if you are invested in the series, but the writing is choppy, confusing, and void of the true suspense that could have been.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I will now always read reviews to save downloading trash like this. Disappointing and sad reflection on current human  trends, that this rates in Top 50. Delete, delete, delete and warn parents that this is so available to our youth. This book should have some kind of warning classification because the content is offensive.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is really really fun and entertaining it will keep you coming back to check on all of your animal families and works great on my kindle fire
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is better than harry potter in the sense that Suzanne Collins was a great author before writing this book when J.K.R was not. What J.K.R has going for is creativity and making a seres 7 books long. what S.C has going for was making a good book with out magic or vampires.
B004MC0FO8|3.0|I had to uninstall it because it was taking up WAAAY too much space on my phone's memory. It's cool to have the app though in case you find a song you like, but don't know what it is..although I ran into a few times when it didn't hear it or some other problem. Especially in low 3G areas, it would have a hard time finding the song (which it looks up here)
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Really makes you think and be creative when playing.  Not really a \\"pull and smash\\" type of game.  Best of the series.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Launching the Amazon appstore with the free version of AB Rio was a brilliant strategy, and its what made me get the app store in the first place. Although Rio doesn't get near as many updates as Seasons does, it's still quite a lot of fun, especially the boss battles which are more or less exclusive to the Rio version.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The item arrived in two days. The packaging was in pristine condition and was very unique which surprised and delighted me. The item was in excellent condition and exactly what I was expecting and more. I would most definitely purchase from this seller again and would strongly recommend them to other people
B004SBX112|4.0|When Seasons went up on Free App Day, I immediately downloaded it. And I'm glad I did; the ad version makes playing a chore, especially on older smartphone models.<br /><br />Seasons is really fun, and Rovio does a great job at keeping it updated. All the new levels you get are always worth the 99 cents you'll pay.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I finished this book, which I don't always do. Fortunately, I only paid $3.99 to download it onto my phone. I'm sure I won't read the two sequels. I suppose in fairness, it was written for young people, which I'm not. However, I cannot understand for the life of me how this book has remained at the top of the best seller list for so long. It's average at best. The author spends a huge amount of time describing every morsel that the main character puts into her mouth throughout the story, yet apparently never had to go to the toilet the entire time she was living in caves and trees. I always get a kick out of the writings of people about living in the wild who have apparently never actually spent much time living in the wild. She writes about land mines, with obviously no clue as to how land mines actually operate. I guess if you're writing for a ten year old, that's fine, but if you're an adult, forget this book.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I love the Angry Birds series, and Space is a perfect addition to the group. What sets it apart from other Angry Birds games, though is that it has new gravity features. It really makes you think rather than just mindlessly launch the birds into the structures.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|This was a good movie for hubby and I to watch together.  Little far fetched at times, but hey...its Batman...LOL
0439023491|5.0|I loved all 3 books, but I have to say the 2nd book was by far my favorite.  I read it in 3 days, which is a huge record breaker for me.  I could not put it down, as I could not believe what was happening to these poor characters!  If you think the trouble for Katniss and Peeta is finally over, think again.  Trouble is back, and bigger than ever.  President Snow must be one of the most evil characters ever written!  You can't stop reading, you HAVE to know what is going to happen next.<br /><br />It's amazing how detailed these books are written.  I've never felt so part of the action with a book before, and this book is non stop action.  Not to mention how well we get to know and love these characters.  It's almost like you get to  know them personally.<br /><br />I do have to say that I'm not sure I agree with these books being \\"yound adult\\".  These are very emotional books, and I think the subject matter might be rough on less mature audiences. Kids killing kids is a topic not for the weak at heart, so I would recommend adults only.  But having said that, truly up there as some of the best reads ever for me.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Please update so that I don't have to wait 100+ hours to collect on food and buildings as well as complete quests.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not my cup of tea. It's just a bad book pretending to be deep. If you want true SM with deep feelings read the life of the The Marqués du Sade, he was the first person in the history with a SM syndrome and was executed because of it. He wrote several books, but his life is the real novel!<br />[[ASIN:B007J4T2G8 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B006DHASYM|5.0|If you consider yourself to be a super critical, cynical type, than go ahead and read the 1-star ratings of this movie.  If, on the other hand, you are just a fan of the romantic comedy genre, you will love this movie.  There are lots of laughs, the acting is sincere, and you come away happier than when you sat down to start with.  Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  If you like to laugh, you'll like it to.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I was very disappointed with the game, it sure didn't live up to all the hype it got. There aren't many levels and I just didn't find it fun to play.
0545265355|3.0|I'm sure the books will be a great read. Can't wait to dive in. BUT<br />The advertisement says (Hardcover). They are not.<br />As in all things if it seems to be too good to be true, well, you know.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|The Hype about Richard Castle as the author is as much fun as reading the book. It was well written and enjoyed it very much.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I bought this for my girls. I'm not just an any one genre fan, but Ms. Clarkson does well with this one. The girls wanted the \\"Stronger\\" song and I wanted to hear some of her other ones.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Great tv show, great premis for series of detective books. Enjoy the stories and the writing. If the gost writer ever comes out of closet and writes his or her own books I would enjoy reading them.  Naked Heat great story that did not give up who done it in the first few chapters.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game. I love it, especially to just pass the time. fabulous game that everyone should play
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I really liked this book, it sucks you in and keeps you entertained.  The author is a good writer and I will check out some of her other books.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Who doesn't love the Godfather movies?? This is a great collection to have, especially the blu-ray disks. Highly recommended this collection - great gift idea as well.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its the most amazing game I have ever played on my kindle fire who ever wants to get this game don't wait get it now
B006OV7RQ4|4.0|It's not an action film: it's a psychological movie.<br /><br />This is one of the most intelligent psychological movies I've seen. I was riveted to my seat to see where Martha's decision to leave the cult would take her: the movie concists of a series of revelations about what she does and doesn't understand now that she's outside of the cult. In spite of her escape from the farm, it's as if her mind is under water, struggling to emerge into clarity and complete rejection of the cult, but her mind is still controlled by the cult's influence. It's pretty horrifying for the viewer to grasp just how delusional she has become in the company of psychopaths, and I was not at all disappointed by the end of the movie. Are we surprised that she is as passive as she has been throughout the film? No: her will has been just about completely broken by Patrick.<br /><br />After it ended, I said to myself, That is the scariest film I've seen since \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Amazing!!!!!!! I love this game! It is FREE unless you want more cash (The cash is to buy cooler things and help your town easier).<br /><br />This is a very fun game. It kinda teaches you what it was like for people in the olden days.<br />The game is mostly about making a pioneer town. Sometimes, people get hurt or sick and you have to heal them and if you don't heal them in time, the worst comes.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is a wonderful game. :o)
B001E45XT4|2.0|My boyfriend purchased three of these headsets for himself, his brother, and myself. They were amazing, comfortable, good-looking headsets. Two months after, his brother's broke much like other reviews have stated. They start fracturing along the arm where it meets the telescope until they break completely. We thought it was an isolated thing, maybe he has a big head or something, but shortly after mine broke in the exact same spot, and then my boyfriend's set broke just like the other two. I think many reviewers are saying these headphones are \\"sturdy\\" but what they actually mean is that they LOOK and FEEL sturdy but in application they are not.<br /><br />I Macguyvered mine back together with electrical tape and an old membership card for stability, but I would not recommend purchasing these if you don't want to put that kind of time into fixing something you shouldn't have to fix. Just go with a Koss or something with a little more flexibility.<br /><br />In summation, The sound quality is great. They are comfortable before they break, (and they will break). Don't let the look of them fool you because they have a major design flaw.
0439023521|4.0|Bought for my grand daughter, didn't think it seemed like a very appropriate book with all the bullying but apparently many many kids are reading it. It was delivered quickly as everything I order from Amazon.
B00634GHJA|5.0|great app for kindel fires because my kindle does not have or take photos. I think it is really great
B007R41E8O|1.0|I bought this app about 4 hours ago and,  like others,  I'm having the hardest time getting through the second part of the download. I'm now on the third time. To say it's a little frustrating would be putting it mildly.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is amazing and is worth it!! the game is not like any other village or city building game. the graphics are amazing on the kindle fire.. to those people that claim they have to shut it off in order to exit the game, its not true. to exit the game click on stuff then options and the black bar will pop up so don't listen to other reviews
B007LB1O3I|2.0|Let me just start by saying that I LOVE Madonna.  I'm 39 and have loved her since her early days.  I think I've liked or loved every one of her albums except American Life and now, this one.  I've seen her in concert twice.  She puts on a great show. And I have tickets to her upcoming 2012 concert.  But ugh, I'm not looking forward to having to endure some of these new songs.  My sentiments are probably along with the other reviews.  There are a couple \\"OK\\" songs on this album.  I like Girl Gone Wild, Masterpiece, and Falling Free.<br /><br />For the most part, it sounds like she showed up for the recording of this album, recorded a few lines of lyrics for each track and they put those lines on repeat and autotuned the hell out of her voice. I could have recorded Gang Bang if all the lyrics were just spoken.<br /><br />We all know she is her biggest fan and is completley narcissistic.  But dang, she should have spent a few more hours per day on this album and few less in the gym turning her body into a machine.<br /><br />Her voice on the \\"Ray of Light\\" was AMAZING!  That album was more age appropriate for her age NOW then when it was released in the 1990's.  I don't need to hear her dropping the f-bomb or cussing constantly to think that she is provocative.<br /><br />She will always be queen of pop, no argument there.  But this album was disappointing.  And I loved Hard Candy and Confessions...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|love the game but seriously needs the Dangerzone update. come on rovio! make the magic happen! other than that the game is legitimately awesome.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|its a great start but is very laggy o. the fire and has poor video quality. No option to log in to see who you are following.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a very good game and kept me busy for hours you should check it out and just try it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app....you can read different versions of Bible bookmark highlight and it has a audio so it can read to you. easy to navigate.
1416550542|2.0|I had high hopes for this book as it looked like one to sink into. I very rarely give a two star review and in this instance it's not that the writing is bad it's actually good but the story is not well told. It's much too long and too many timelines and viewpoints. I only enjoyed Eliza's section and found myself skimming the 1975 and 2005 timelines to get back to the only character I cared about, Eliza. The other characters were not well developed enough to care about them and in fact were just unlikeable. The story was thoroughly depressing and just became more so as the book dragged on. The ending was not at all satisfying. It was just disappointing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game has been a lot of fun. I found it when I purchased my kindle. I plan on getting it on my phone also. highly recommended!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is really. fun and enjoy able.my daughter loves go play and it gives us something to sit and do together that isn't boring and too kidish
B0006J28L4|5.0|MALCOLM X was an interesting movie. I give Spike Lee his props for making a movie during tuff times. But I would have rather Spike Lee give over the rights to use the X to Dr. Betty Shabazz when she was alive. That's why it's crucial to own your own name. So BEWARE of any filmmaker even the ones who are African/African-American who want to reap the cashflow from your biographical life story or any screenplay you submit to their production companies.<br /><br />Ernest Dickerson did a wonderful job with the cinematography. Denzel's acting was superb along with Delroy Lindo and many others in the film.<br /><br />The sound in the movie was all that. The sets were outstanding for the location scenes.<br /><br />A MUST SEE!
B002LLE3PY|3.0|Well, I have to say that the job Steve Wilson did on the work of this album and \\"Wake\\" was stupendous! The music sounds wayyyyyyy better than before. It;'s probably obvious I like the fist installments of the group. As the line-ups changed through the years, the \\"evolved\\" I believe also. In spite of Roberts great guitar work all down through the years, I still loved the whole \\"Crimson\\" soundk, especially the Mellotron. Without which Crimson was just simply not Crimson. Good job with the anniversary editions so far, I'm waiting on \\"Starless\\" now to come in the mail. Also, I get the whole personality \\"thing\\" between Fripp and Peter Sinfield, but REALLY NOW! Best lyricist other than maybe John Anderson. I recently received \\"Wake\\" and \\"Lizard\\" and the sounds are great! But, I can't seem to get the DVD's to play in my DVD recorder/player. On both all I get is the menu and then the music. I've decided to keep both of them anyway, and just look around for the right type of dvd player. Does anybody have a clue about what type of dvd player I need?
0439023491|5.0|book came fast. my daughter loved it. said it was a very good book. read it in two days! would order anytime.
0439023483|5.0|This book arrived on time and pretty fast. And, the book was a page turner. I could not stop reading it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Awesome game!!!! full of non-stop action. You will not get bored! Prepare to get hooked on this game cause its gonna be hard to quit playing. Once your in the zone your in it!
B00006I53S|5.0|the IS is amazingly helpful. I took a handheld  (leaning against wall, but still) exposure at 0.5\\" and it came out sharp! If you are looking for an inexpensive lens to bide your time before you can afford an L, then this is it. I picked mine up on eBay for $210, and so far the results have already gotten me an offer to do a wedding, not to mention numerous complements on my pictures. Highly recommended, but be aware that this is a slightly older lens, and isn't an L, but it works.
1401937519|5.0|This is just what I needed right now.  It takes ideas in previous works by Neale Donald Walsch and Echo Bodine and really drills down on them.  If you are ready, this book can really make a difference in your life.  I suspect that those who don't like this book are simply at a difference place in their spiritual development, and that is OK, too.
B000FA5STS|3.0|I ordinarily like Balducci a lot but this book was rather pedantic and not up to his usual suspense level.  It took quite a bit of \\"control\\" for me to even finish it...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am so hooked on this game I can't put my kindel fire down. You must down load this game.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Absolutely interesting, thoughtful and a reading must.  However, there are entire chapters dedicated to maudlin reminiscences of personal memories which are totally out of place.  Incomprenhible how the editors allowed that material to be included in this extraordinary book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was an excellent continuation of the Hunger Games. It had a surprising \\"non-ending\\" which lead me to read the Mokingjay.
B006OB3K56|4.0|Remember all those Cecil B. DeMille biblical epics in which CB graphically illustrated the sins he was supposed to be condemning? This film takes a similar approach. The moral is clear. Sex addiction is bad. It is a form of spiritual death. And just to make sure you get the point, we are going to let you spend two hours staring at Michael Fassbender's naked quivering backside as he penetrates a succession of nubile young women. As a cure for sex addiction, it needs work.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. The film is extremely well made. Fassbender is a compelling, eminently watchable actor. Even when he has his clothes on. But several scenes in the film are nothing short of pornographic. If this is the antidote to sex addition, then Jack Daniels is a cure for alcoholism.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found this final book slow at first and a little hard to get addicting. However, half way through is when it became a raging forest fire. I like the ending and how the \\"star struck\\" lovers actually materialized.

B001EOOQEC|5.0|I Remember when this was first released in 1992.I was surprised that Dio had joined Black Sabbath after a 10 year period, however for some reason i passed this one by.<br />I recently bought this one to complete my Black Sabbath / Dio years collection as i also have Heaven & Hell and Mobs Rule. All the songs on Dehumanizer i have not heard before so when i first played it my jaw virtually dropped after a few seconds of playing Computer god....This is one awsome Black Sabbath record has everything from the over the top vocals from Ronnie to the heavy quick guitar riffs to the monstrous drumming !!!. My favourite tracks are Computer god, After All, Letters from Earth, Master Of Insanity, Time Machine and I. Generally there are no fillers whatsoever here. They have certainly created a masterpiece here and they have also blown away their previous albums. It is my favourite Black Sabbath / Dio recording. Anybody that likes Dio(solo) or Black Sabbath post ozzy buy it now!!! you will not be dissapointed !!!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|If you like a lot of action in a movie,  this is the one to get.  It keeps you right on the edge of your seat.  From the beginning to the end, absolutely exciting!!  Denzil Washington and Chris Pine are excellent!!  Thank you, Linda P

B00466HN6S|4.0|great movie... kids loved it due to the Easter bunny and then relating it to real life person.  Would recommend it to all.
B00753MBHA|5.0|Wow, who would have thought it was possible? Accept have now managed to put out 2 back to back albums that rival or exceed even their pinnacle works in the 80s, this type of solid output is almost unheard of in a band that is OVER 30 YEARS OLD ! I actually prefer Stalingrad over BotN ,I think the songs are skewered more to the \\"metal\\" side of the equation,which suits my tastes,whereas BotN had a few more \\"rock/groove\\" oriented tracks on it. Excellent production by Andy Sneap, and Mark Tornillo sounds even more comfortable in his frontman postion now. Most bands when they change singers make you long for the previous singer (Nightwish, etc.) but in this case I think Mark is an even better fit for the sound of the band than Udo ever was and seems to have really lit a creative fire under their a#* . I actually had to pull out my old copies of \\"Balls to the Wall\\" and \\"Metal Heart\\", largely considered their two most legendary albums, to compare back to back with Stalingrad and I would say Stalingrad is the better album, certainly better than Metal Heart and at least as good if not better than \\"Balls\\",and obviously due to better technology it has much better production than either.  ....Now, if only Mark Tornillo would shave that aggravating-to-look-at pubic hair off his chin.
B007SGM084|1.0|........like others have posted, the Kindle version is entirely priced too high.  I saw a Friday night news program where they interviewed the author of these books.<br /><br />The news program's reporter said this book set is taking the world by storm, and I am extremely curious to read it.  I guess I will just bite the bullet to get the set for my Kindle.....as it is much cheaper than the paper version.<br /><br />Amazon!!!  Please lower the prices of the Kindle version!!!  PLEASE!!
B006ZT47O0|1.0|Look,I have been a fan of this band since their inception a decade ago and own everything they have done including the classical album, I have tried giving this multiple listens to see of it grows on me, but unlike \\"Divine Conspiracy\\" which grew on me to become my favorite album ,this one only gets more aggravating with each successive listen. The songs are all disjointed with no cohesion and no \\"identity\\", there are so many time and tempo changes it becomes impossible to get into the \\"groove\\" of a song and one must wonder whether Mark Jansen suffers from full blown ADD and is off his meds, ther are LITERALLY 20 time changes within 2 minutes on certain songs, that is not \\"progressive\\" it is just downright aggravating.<br />Simone sings every song the same and sounds tired like she is just dialing in her performance on this one. The lyrics are so sappy and nauseatingly Left wing I was half expecting Jane Fonda to make a guest appearance.<br />The production is lackluster as well. There is not a truly \\"heavy\\" song on the album, as soon as things start to speed up there are tempo changes and slowed down again, it just plods along with choppy mid-tempo numbers and ineffective semi-ballads. The only song I REALLY like on here is \\"Twin Flames\\" , which if you knew me you might find ironic since I usually prefer the ultra heavy songs like \\"Mother of Light\\" , but Twin Flames ,a bonus track no less, is the only song that has any cohesion and can stand on it's own as a \\"song\\" with an identifiable melody, it sounds like a good Broadway number that could have been in \\"Phantom\\" or \\"Les Miserables\\".<br />...as for the rest of the album, Epica really needs to get back to the drawing board because this was a complete mess.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I really enjoy these type of games. I down loaded this app from Amazon for free. The only hold back from it getting 5 stars is the screen is set in landscape only. Graphics are very good sound is a bit redundant but you can turn it off or down. Thanks Amazon!

B004SUWR2C|5.0|I believe this app is reasonably priced and fun to use. Plus it is a good time wasting game while waiting at the doctors. I just wish I could have waited a little and got it at .49 instead of .99. (lol I'm frugal.)

0345529057|4.0|Great deal for the price. Print is nice and clear. Shippment was not that fast, but it was what promised and arrived at time.
0439023521|5.0|product was as described--arrived very quickly, but as I've recently read magazine articles concerning online ordering warehouse jobs, I would like to express my concern with working demands.  I do not need super speedy service as purchases usually do arrive.  If they arrive a few days slower so the warehouse workers don't have to bust their chops, that's fine with me.  I don't order online for the speedy service, but for the convenience and specificity of products.  Thanks for the consideration for the workers in the distribution centers!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I truly don't understand the success of this book and why it was suggested to me as a must read.  It is not.  The writing is extremely juvenile.  The characters are woefully shallow.  Anna seems to speak in cliches.  The author must think so little of the American educational system as to cast such a dimwit in the lead role during her senior year of college[[ASIN:B007FZRQW8 Deadly Acceleration (Enforcement Division)]].  I am embarrassed for those who recommend this book.
B004XIQIPQ|5.0|These guys are so talented they can do no wrong. This album is so good it only takes one listen to get hooked. All the songs have catchy melodies, with the exception of Brick by Brick. This song seems of out place, and its not something you would think Arctic monkeys would have ever written. But still overall the album has a sort if relaxing vibe to it. The songs are well written lyrically and musically. Some standout songs are 'Suck it and See,' 'Shes Thunderstorms,''Reckless Serenade.'
B003RV43X4|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. I was not even a third of the way through it before I started to question whether the director/writers wanted us to take this movie seriously or whether this was a tongue-in-cheek spoof; however, when I realized the director/writers were serious, I was appalled.  The characters were flat, the dialogue would insult a child in kindergarten, and the story was non-existent.  The only reason I gave this a one star was because as soon as my mom and realized how bad it was, I started to make up alternative dialogue for the scenes, and we laughed our way through the whole movie.  Unless you do that (which is highly entertaining but not what the creators were going for I'm sure), don't waste your money.
0375704027|5.0|Norwegian Wood is as lucid and vivid as a book could ever be. Taking you to an unbelievable journey of growing up, love, lost love, new love, understanding life, and dealing with loss of the loved ones. Murakami started the book with a hint of mystery, continued the story with a realistic portrayal of a young man with his young, heroic love, along with a lot of humors that are actually very funny, then finished the book with a lingering feeling of mystery. This is the book, that will stay forever and will always be an amazing read, no matter what generation you are.
B0030GCZO0|5.0|One could say that \\"Casablanca at its core is about love and romance\\", Rick and Elsa's time in Paris is at the core of their wonderful love affair. But Casablanca is much more then an ordinary romantic fling. The lovers who met in Paris found things about each other that excited them and made them yearn for an even more intimate relationship; but ironically what they didn't know about each other set the stage for a far more profoundly consequential development one which neither of them would have initially chosen.<br /><br />The conclusion of Casablanca can be characterized but Rick words to Elsa, \\"remember we will always have Paris\\"; for it the essence of what this extraordinary movie is about and that is that the passion and feelings that the two  lovers felt for each other paled in comparison to the profound cause that Elsa's husband was fighting for i.e., the defeat of the Nazi cancer that was sweeping across Europe, and that it was ultimately the extraordinary character of Rick, cynical, selfish  Rick, that moved him ever reluctantly and sadly to conclude that Elsa's husband needed her to continue his cause and that cause was more important and profound than an even a loving relationship between a man and a women.<br /><br />One could say that \\"Casablanca at its core is about love and romance\\", Rick and Elsa's time in Paris is at the core of their wonderful love affair. But the core theme of Casablanca is much more than about an great romantic interlude; it about the character of man who was moved to give up the love of his life for a cause, that sadly he found far more worthy.<br /><br />You don't see that strength of character very often in so called \\"real life\\" and this is what separates Casablanca from other great movies and makes it perhaps the greatest in the history of cinema.
B003JTHTZS|4.0|I have to admit I wasn't that interested in reading this book.  It didn't seem like a serious book, and the idea of modern Russian master novel is pretty ambitious.  BUT, it's actually a really good book.  It get's better the more you read it, and ultimately pretty much is what it sets out to be.  It tells the life story of the title character from her early elite school days as an idealistic school girl who falls under the spell of her pre-Bolshevik revolutionary uncle just before and at the time of the 1917 revolution.  The story then moves to her Soviet glory days in the height of the \\"cult of personality.\\"  Of course, no great Russian novel is complete without a bathetic descent, and fortunately in Stalinist Russia that happened every day.  The story closes in the mid90s after the fall of communism, but not before its secrets have lost their power.  It's really well down and worth a read.  I gave it 4 stars because of the company it keeps, which is pretty heady stuff.  If you are looking for a \\"real\\" great modern Russian novel read Life and Fate by Grossman, that's a true masterpiece I'd say one of the greatest books of the 20th century.  Just the story of how the book was published is worth the price of admission.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I got interested in reading the series after I first watched the movie, which I was reluctant to do because of the Battle Royale copycat comparisons. Being trapped on an island and having to kill eachother (young adults) that is actually a television show, that idea has been used before. However that's when the similarities end.<br /><br />The first book is by far the best of the trilogy. The characters appeared so realistic, the battles were dynamic and entertaining. The cliffhangers were jaw dropping, and I could not just stop reading. The first book had me excited to read the rest, I wanted to find out what happens to the characters I rallied for. The plot, while there are comparisons to the 10+ year old series Battle Royale, I enjoyed the character's history as well as the SCIFI/futuristic feeling the series gives. The setting, the characters, the plot twists, the romance, the action--it was epic. I felt the first book is a million times better than any fad novel series than before, I understood the hype.<br /><br />In the third book, The pace is slow, the plot line becomes uninteresting, the main characters I fall for lose their likeability and become annoying--just like Harry Potter. The series that I couldn't stop reading finally becomes a series where I question if I should read the rest. The world Katniss and the world she lives in, it loses its fire and spark. I feel that Collins ignored the first book she wrote and completely altered the characters, the world, and everything about it in a poor, rushed manner. If Collins had stopped after book number 1, that would have been one of the best books I have ever read. But instead, it'll be a series I will probably forget.<br /><br />I hate when authors play god in their books, for no pointless reason, they turn the world they create in a manner that contradicts the first two books. What happened to strong Katniss, who was tough, but sweet, kindhearted, and noble? By the third book she is complaining whiny 17-year old girl who goes completely nuts. Peeta, the baker's son, I loved him. He was the best character from the book, he was quick on his feet, strong, and compassionate, he was so likable! By the third book, he goes crazy and hateful and especially weak in morale. Gale, Katniss's support system, they're fighting all of the time! \\"Let her pick the man she can't survive without\\", what a joke! . However, the rest of the deaths, what significance was it? I understand the theme of the final book, revolt, war, and change. However when I read a fictional books, I want to be transformed into the writer's world. People die in wars and revolt, but I could just pick up a banal newspaper or step outside. The fantastic world she created shattered in the finale. By the end of the series, some o the character's I root for meet their death, I don't experience sadness or sympathy like for Rue, I feel anger. I am angry because she has to kill every character to make a point. Rue's death sent a signal to the reader, that the Hunger Games are real and that people die. Her death was beautiful, significant, and moving. We don't need a watered down version 1000 times over. I know that in war and revolt, people change. But the characters lose their originality, their spark, uniqueness, and every aspect of themself. You can tell she was hurried in the final book to end the series, as a reader I definitely felt rushed. There was no real conclusion to the book.
145470246X|5.0|I waited a long time for this book and it was so worth it.  Lots of romantic beading projects with clear instructions and diagrams.  The pictures are fantastic.  I enjoyed the author's unique character and wit as she describes her style, techniques and inspiration. Full of encouragement to every beader who wants to grow in their beadweaving skills.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|This and the original quell are both stimulating to play. Anyone looking to take their mind off of things but not just zone out will enjoy the workout this game provides for the brain.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game has it all lol it had my attention right away very good. the only thing i wish it had is to were u didnt have to get glu coins to keep upgrading
B000FC0O7M|5.0|Excellent Read - a must for anyone who was interested in the space program in the early.  Gene Kranz & Kris Kraft were household name when the Mercury Program was alive.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app about three years. First on my blackberry and now on my kindle fire. I mostly enjoy the bible plans. I usually read the KJV but if I need a clearer understanding of verses I can easily switch to a more recent vervsion. l also send verses chapters and some of my daily plans to my friends. Great app!!!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This game runs well on android. It is very challenging but not so challenging that you get frustrated and stop playing. Every level presents unique challenges to overcome. I really love this game and will be disappointed when I finish it. Great concept great fun.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Bared to You: A Crossfire novel by Sylvia Day was absolutely fantastic. At first I thought that it would be a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey and although their are some similarities I enjoyed this book much, much more. I cannot wait for the sequel! October is too far away.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. very addicting. I'm 23 and really enjoyed it. defiantly recommend. its a great game for ages ten and up.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Used this app to transfer photos from my Razr to a Win 7 laptop and an iPad. Once you select the photos you want to send, just enter the URL as it shows on the app and voila...it just works
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love watching Ellen on her show. However, I have never read anything by her so I was skeptical at first. Some parts were funny, but it was not what I expected. For some reason, it just didn't do it for me. I think I would find it more enjoyable if I saw her saying her thoughts from this book.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I have mostly given up trying to use this app.  It may work better in some other locations.  It was free, so I guess I can't complain too loudly.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Great movie. I have been to Sweden and also watched the original foreign film. This remake is very good and a good thriller.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Absolutely must see film, with great undertones of gangster films, humility, compassion, love and humanity. Loved it and the soundtrack.
B005VGWT2K|5.0|I'm a Beatles fan since tenth of years and have been looking for the George Harrison DVD in Italy for several months, but it was impossible for me to find it, so I submitted an order to Amazon, because noticed that it was in your product list. After watching it, I can say that I am enthusiastic about the product, both because of the excellent content of Martin Scorsese movie and the high quality of the media. I am proud to have in my catalog a so important document about a musician I love.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|A window opens up every 2 seconds with the title &quot;test placement&quot;, shows the ad, I hit the &quot;close&quot; burton, and another one pops up.<br />Galaxy tab
B004XZ99LO|5.0|Cirque du Soleil: Journey of Man [Blu-ray 3D] is outstanding. The next best thing to being there. Highly recommend. Wish it was longer. They are simply amazing.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game was really fun at first.  But not so much now. Too many glitches! All of my stuff that is only supposed to take 1 minute to regenerate is now taking over 24 hours to regenerate. What's the deal? I'm learning that free games = crap! Fix the glitches &amp; I would change my rating.
B003L1Z474|5.0|The perfect selection for my first grandchild.<br />What better way to introduce reading to the next generation than with the popular New England tale.<br />I can't wait to begin reading  . . .
0385342063|5.0|This is officially my favorite book written by Sophie Kinsella, with \\"Remember Me\\" coming in second. I think that the character development in the central characters is very well written and I enjoyed the plot twists and turns. This book reads as intended: a humor-filled romance that keeps you guessing. Readers should recognize Kinsella's writing style and her heroine, Poppy, reads similar to the Shopaholic books. I have read other reviews that criticize the lack of \\"sensuality\\", which I disagree with. Kinsella focuses on character development and includes small moments of sensuality which in turn feel more grandiose and significant because of their rarity. There are fun additions to Kinsella's typical writing style, including Poppy's addiction to footnotes, which provides an additional facet for her humor to shine. Overall, I would highly recommend \\"I've Got Your Number\\" by Sophie Kinsella. Excellent read.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|If this second season is anywhere near as good as the first, it is well worth buying. Somehow they've managed to put Sherlock and Watson into a 21st century setting and you know what? It works. The writing is outstanding as it the acting and fast-paced direction. Benedict is a worthy sucessor to Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett. Not only are these outstanding but you'll pick up more if you watch each one a second time.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Addicted!  I like this game a lot more than the other frontier type games! Woot! I definitely recommend it. Even my nine year old enjoys playing. :)
B006XBSAP2|5.0|this is the best album i have ever listened to! Thank You So much Katy Perry for existing <3 Hugs And Kisses from your good friend KatysKisses <3
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its lots of fun and great annimations . great little story line. love when Sid pops out. and scat RUNS across the screen which keeps it funded
B003O86FMW|5.0|Continues to keep the reader engaged and surprised! A quick read and emotionally engaging ride that left me wanting to immediately buy the final book.
B004DK49DW|1.0|I first started listening to Social D with Mommy's Little Monster. Yes, I'm that old. When Prison Bound came out, it was obviously different from the first stuff, but it came to really define them and their sound and to me, they've kicked ass ever since. Even a song like \\"Angel's Wings\\" was a pretty hardcore love song off the last one. But I downloaded \\"Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes\\" without even playing a preview of a track because, hell, it's Social Distortion, right?? I hit play after it all came down and said to my computer, \\"What the hell is this?!\\"<br />It sounds lame. There's an edge missing from the guitars, from Mike's vocals, from the songs in general. I guess like all bands that have been around for so long, they reach a point where the sound just sort of fades. Rolling Stones, The Who, Van Halen, Kiss, Alice Cooper, The Misfits... maybe Social Distortion has reached that same plateau.
B0050PYNP8|2.0|Very funny Sci Fi spoof, based upon Roswell crash. Obscene language, no nudity, not suitable for young children. If it weren't for the obscenity children should enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is an awesome game because it has all of the games that you could imagine at your fingertips. They are also not easy butnot hard games so that you can unlock the games without getting annoyed and throwing your electronic on the floor in frustration. This game is the best game in the universe!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a good interactive game. if you are bored this works. try it if you like Mario but cant get on kindle.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Very intuitive but several categories I've created keep disappearing a week or more later.  Wassup with that?  If the developers could fix this and other bugs that people note, it would be a 5+ star app.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|This series makes Twilight look like a shabby, poorly crafted Mary-Sue piece of fan fic. Oh . . . wait . . .<br /><br />Instead, take Stephen King's word for it. This is a post-apocalyptic tale that calls to mind his earlier stories; The Running Man and The Long Walk with the dystopian reality show themes. Yes, the main character is a teenager and this is sometimes a little too evident but overall it's an enjoyable and easy read that pulls few punches as you would expect from a series featuring children killing each other.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie coming out and I just knew there was a book associated with it so I went to look on IPAD in Ibooks but I found nothing then off to the kindle store I went I download the first book loved it halfway thru I had already bought the second book and then I the third read them all in a week and started over again!! The first book is so great fast easy read keeps you guessing building up the suspense loved it!!!! Hated the ending but into the second book I went!!! All books were great wish there was more!!!!
0802473164|5.0|This is an excellent book. My husband and I have been together for almost nine years. We read this together early on in our relationship, and it really helped a lot. It offered a lot of insight for both of us and we definitely came away with a better understanding of ourselves and each other. A couple years ago I gave that copy to a co-worker. We recently decided to give ourselves a \\"refresher course\\" and were perfectly happy to buy it again.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very fun game to play. good time killer<br />nice graphics as well . there's nothing to lose<br /><br />its free
B007CKNX28|4.0|It's hard to fathom that \\"Blunderbuss\\" is the prolific Jack White's solo debut. Sonically, it's not far off from his day job; catchy Blues/ Garage Rock, though most songs fall in the mellow bracket. Opening cut \\"Missing Pieces\\" (with a squealing guitar solo, nice piano riff and the line \\"I was in the shower so I could not tell my nose was bleeding\\") is a fine example of oddball Rock.<br /><br />\\"Sixteen Saltines\\" is a raucous rocker, followed by a slew of more laid back songs; the stealth-like \\"Freedom At 21\\", the acoustic Americana \\"Love Interruption\\", the beautiful lush ballad \\"Blunderbuss\\",  \\"Hypocritical Kiss\\",  And \\"Weep Themselves To Sleep\\".<br /><br />Upping the tempo is the gritty Blues Rocker \\"I'm Shakin'\\" before going more mellow on \\"Trash Tongue Talker\\".  Closing are \\"On And On And On\\" (with chiming cascading keys), and the waltzing Hymn-like \\"Take Me With You When You Go\\".<br /><br />No blunder here, but a winner!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I normally don't give out book reviews too often.  I think reading is a matter of personal likes and dislikes.  By book 3, I couldn't imagine  how many more times these two could have sex!  I thought it would get dull.  It didn't.  I was expecting this to fizzle, it never did.  EL James, if you are reading this...you nailed it at the end writing from Christian's point of view.  I didn't expect this and it was incredible - there is your next book, Ms. James.
B007CKNX28|4.0|Last year Jack White suffered two break ups, the first being the break up of his band The White Stripes who after six albums called it a day, the second was the breakup of his marriage to Karen Elson. So it's fair to say Jack White might have a few things he might want to get off his chest and what better way than to it by releasing his first solo album the wonderful \\"Blunderbuss\\" Which is an album of many varying styles and finds one of the most gifted guitarists of his generation on great form throughout.<br /><br />Anybody who misses The White Stripes will be delighted with the opening combo of \\"Missing Pieces\\" and \\"Sixteen Saltines\\". Indeed the opening and middle parts of \\"Missing Pieces\\" sounds reminiscent of \\"Dead Leaves and The Dirty Ground\\" and has rich sounding organ and a familiar Jack White solo. \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" is the closest to a White Stripes song can be without the irreplaceable Meg White. There's a brilliant cover of the Little Wilie John (written by Rudy Toombs) song \\"I'm Shakin'\\" which has White raising his vocal range and is accompanied by excellent background vocals and keeps true to its 1960 roots.<br /><br />The title track itself is a wonderful low key affair with a White's voice providing the emotion for the song itself as he sings over an organ and strings. On first single \\"Love Interruption\\" White's is brilliantly backed up by Ruby Amanfu on backing vocals. On the song \\"Freedom at 21\\" White waxes lyrically and features a trademark Jack White riff and solo. The final track on the album \\"Take Me with you When You Go\\" which starts out tame enough before changing pace at past the two minute mark into a frenzied assault of fast paced vocals, it's a great way to close out a superb debut album.<br /><br />Yes The White Stripes are missed big time and there is no way Jack White could create the on stage/studio chemistry that he had with Meg White with anyone else but on his first solo album White has come up trumps delivering an album full of wonderfully wired sounding songs with heartfelt lyrics that reflect his state of mind coming off a tough year personally. Just for good measure his ex-wife Karen Elson provides backing vocals on the album, it also features the drumming of Carla Azar from the band Autolux. \\"Blunderbuss\\" is an album that deserves repeated listens and shows even on his own White can deliver music that is essential listening.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Before I purchased Game of Thrones (\\"G.O.T.\\"), I read the first 2 books in the series.  WOW!!  I couldn't believe I had never read them before, they were so good.  By the time I purchased the G.O.T. television series, I was absolutely hooked.  Watching the series was like jumping into the first book itself.  The show followed the book very closely, which was surprising since there are so many intricate details.  And although I already knew what was going to happen, I still found myself screaming at the television as I watched each episode (especially when it came to Sansa), which I watched straight through.  Well done, HBO!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Trite, salacious, not a compelling story.  I got as far as the second book hoping the story and writing would improve.  It did not and I have not bothered to finish it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book. Once I started to read it I couldn't put it down. I finished it the after a day of reading, and then quickly moved on to the other books in the series. After reading the book, I understand why there was the hype surrounding the movie.
0439023513|5.0|I just finished reading the book Mockingjay. The third book in the Hunger Games trilogy, this book is less about the actual Hunger Games portion in Panem, but rather the book focuses on the spark of the rebellion that came up the first time Katniss and Peeta won the Hunger Games. And the fire that grew into the rebellion was fueled by them winning the Games again the next year for a second time. The last time rebellion forced the Capitol to bomb the now non-existent District 13, or so people were led to believe. Actually District 13 is real and is an underground city living entirely without the Capitol. The rebels are fighting against the Capitol and it actually looks like they are succeeding. Until, at the end of the book, when the Capitol gets all the children in District 12 in the town center and they bombed the children. While they were sending bombs down, Prim, Katniss's sister, got killed by the Capitol.<br /><br /> I don't think this book could be written in any different time setting because in this part of the series, the author is trying to symbolize that the ruling of the Capitol is coming to an end. Therefore, the time setting of the book is post-apocalyptic. However I think that the area that the book is set in geographically isn't important. I think that the District that the main characters come from is important because I think that the author is trying to symbolize that even underdogs can do something big and important.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I usually don't go for true stories but this one will grab you and touch you and make you applaud! Clare Danes does a great job as Temple Grandin. I hope everyone sees this story and takes away a valuable lesson from it!<br />DVD arrived in perfect condition also.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|works very well.  I wish it had better Support for windows 8.  it does work with 8 but I need to enable the scrolling option and use the menu with the start button.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|I love this movie! A must for anyone's collection! Brought back so many memories! It's crazy and a bit violent, some rough language, but never should be forgotten as one of the cult classics of our time!<br />The DVD arrived in perfect shape also.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app!!  the games are challenging enough that you have to use your brain but ar e so much fun to play.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I really wanted to like this game but you are limited by an energy pool which runs out quickly which forces you to either wait for it to regen or pay the devs real cash for more. also did anyone else notice the rediculous permissons that you give the app? be wary.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it. its fun and easy to play. my son can also play it. has really good graphics as well.
0061743526|1.0|I waited 52 years to read this book. I should have waited 52 more. A real snoozefest. I don't see what all the fuss is about.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|omg if your kids love to build and like the ice age characters then this is the game for u I loved it and will never stop playing it.I hope u enjoy this game like I did get it soon for an amazing price.hope u have fun.:)
0439023491|5.0|This is my all time favorite book and is a great continuation of The Hunger Games. I think Suzanne Collins is a magnificent author and multiple times in the book I paused just wondering how she came up with some of the stuff in this book. I mean I myself love to read and write, but, I know for a fact that with years of training that I could never come up with something this AMAZING! When I start reading it I just can't put it down. It is incredibly detailed and well thought out. Usually I can never finish a whole series including: Harry Potter and Pretty Little Liars but with this book I could not put it down. I ended up carrying it everywhere I went like: the mall, restaurants, doctors appointments and even to the bathroom and Catching Fire is by far my favorite book in the series. I don't think that I can ever in a million years forget about this book I will read and reread this book over a hundred times I'm currently rereading the books just within a month of finishing the series. I can just talk about this series forever but I just want you to know that this is an amazing book and would suggest it to everyone I meet ( within a certain age ). I LOVE THE BOOKS!!!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if u like Mario then u will like this game its for kids and adults pick this game up right away its great
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVEEEEEEEE THIS MOVIE. I have seen it three times and want to see it again and again. I can't wait to see Catching Fire and Mockingjay. This is so my all time FAVORITE movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For me its like every movie in one its action,' romance ( I am team Peeta all the way) and it is just an amazing movie you should totally see it. I love it so much I started a Hunger Games fan club at my school I could go on and on but I just want to get my point across. ITS THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!
B007SSEBCU|2.0|Wow - I had heard this film got mixed reviews, but this was worse than my downgraded expectations.  Meryl Streep's performance is, of course, up to her usual standards.  Wonderful work, and I'm glad she was recognized, wondering if her award also hints at her body of work that's been \\"un\\" awarded.<br /><br />That said, I give a big thumbs down to the approach the writers/director took to telling Thatcher's story.  A previous post suggested that perhaps those who made the film strongly disagreed with Thatcher's politics.  I think they're onto something.  There was no emotional connection, little attempt to humanize or show a believable personal struggle beyond a silhouette of Streep resting head on clenched hands at a desk.  There's simply no evidence that the filmmakers liked any part of this woman or her story.  The nearly two hours was little more than snapshots of historical moments that are already known...no insight or revelation about her, her cabinet, her family.  It felt like watching a lazy book report that basically retold too much of what we already know.  And yes, love or hate her, I think it disrespectful and odd to anchor the story in the present day -- while she's still alive -- with the assumption that she's wandering around her home passing her days in dementia-induced flashbacks being whispered and worried about by caretakers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book. I am glad i was able to read the book before looking at the movie and it was very helpful
1416596585|4.0|Journalist Steven Levy's previous books about Macintosh computers and about hackers make him the perfect insider-outsider, with the knowledge to write a detailed history of famously private Google. Granted unprecedented access, Levy appears to have insightfully interviewed everyone about every moment of Google's history to present this canonical version of the company's saga. Levy seems a little too close to his subject, so perhaps his book is not a warts-and-all chronicle, but most of the stories are fascinating, and it is all well reported. getAbstract recommends this heavily anecdotal history to readers who are launching a start-up, intrigued by computers and cultural history, or interested in a nice, detailed dose of the truth behind all those Google rumors.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I dl'd this for my little boy, who loves any of the Angry Birds games. This is a great 'time filler' while we're travelling in the car. I refuse to succumb to the handheld video games that seem to suck up so much of children's attention and time these days, but this is a simple game that he enjoys on short road trips. Plus, it didn't cost me a fortune like the DS or any of those others would.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Picked this for the Kindle because of the high marks it was getting from fellow readers. I was not sorry. Great read as you move from a short story format to a complete storyline. Very enjoyable, and the follow up book was even better. Great!
0439023513|4.0|But I still couldn't put it down. A brilliant conclusion to the trilogy, Collins kept my attention throughout the entire novel, and while it made me really mad at some points, I found myself crying at others. I highly recommend this series to anyone.
B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather is not a bad app, the basic problem with most apps like this is they do not cover my zip code which is 57754 in the middle of nowhere in the Black Hills, of South Dakota, the closest I can come is Spearfish, SD.  We live in an area that has 5 to 6 different happenings a day, i.e. it could snow in Lead (promounced Leed) and three miles away it can be sunny and bright, go a little more north and the weather can change again in Spearfish, which is 17 miles North from where I live.  We can do the same going East to Rapid City, it can be snowing in Lead and sunshine in Rapid City, so for this program it works pretty good when the weather in the whole area is about the same or close to it.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|This episode SOLD me on the whole series. Be prepared to add \\"Game of Thrones\\" to your 'LIKES'! Quality was great. My only regret was to be so skeptical when it was suggested. Buy it now. Watch. and enjoy!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this app even my brother does the gravity is what I like and the new adventrues that it hase
1612130283|4.0|I am a fan of all literature and was surprised to find that I really enjoyed this book. I mean I really enjoyed it. Really. At first I was embarassed to admit that that I was, in fact, not only reading it but enjoying it and after having finished I had to know what would happen to Ana and Christian. Does he love her? Could she conform for him? Should she? I told my friends about it and lent them my copy and so it began.<br /><br />It may not be the best written or most creative, but James seduced me with her story and I am forever grateful she did.
0439023513|5.0|The fact the Collins had the plot in mind from the beginning is evident by the end and is highly pleasing since many of my favorite epics and trilogies have not always been so clearly constructed (i.e., The Matrix, Lost). I disagree with the readers who think the characters fall flat in the end and that the story isn't satisfactorily concluded. I don't know if anyone writing a review of this book can even begin to relate to the horrors the characters experienced. The nightmare episodes and metal confusion some of the key players undergo is perfectly logical. Expecting them to be fierce heroes throughout the entire story is not only unrealistic; it also does not adhere to the formulas of classic fiction. The characters are dynamic and evolve or de-evolve in exactly the ways you expect if you read closely. Katniss and Peeta ending up together was inevitable and clear to me from the beginning, precisely for the reason Katniss gives: why would \\"the girl on fire\\" need the influence of rage and violence projected by Gail?<br /><br />I love that fact that while the story is told through Katniss's eyes and she is more obviously painted as the heroine, Peter is, in fact, the real hero, who understood and professed several of the book's themes (the importance of maintaining your own identity and dignity, the unabashed violence of war that destroys humanity). Peeta is the only character who sticks to his convictions throughout the book and has a genuine sense of self and purpose; thus, if any character would be able to overcome the mental tortures inflicted by the Capital, it would be him. The fact that the book ended happily at all attests to Collins' commitment to optimism on some level. The importance of family is highlighted as the major reason for existence, despite the cruel and imperfect nature of humans and the societies we build. I would suspect Katniss would have ended up wildly different were it not for Peeta's recovery. Gale and Peeta were right that Katniss wouldchoose who she most needed to survive, and I am sure both Gail and Peeta were aware of this. Isn't that what most of us do?<br /><br />Some reviewers were disappointed that Collins did not give us more elaborate details concerning the fall of the Capital. Considering the book does not advocate the rebels as pure good and the Capital people as pure evil, the overthrow is not as significant as one might expect from the first or second book. The story is also unveiled through Katniss's eyes; consequently, we are given the details from her point of view. Collins suddenly shifting point of view this late in the book would require a distinct purpose. She chose to write the book in 1st person for a reason. I for one appreciate an author who knows how to plan a book and fully commit to the structure; otherwise, the book becomes sloppy and less precise.<br /><br />While I would have liked Katniss to explain her reasons for killing Coin, in the end, disseminating this information would have only caused more violence. This was probably Katniss's most heroic act where she sacrificed herself for the cause rather than for a specific person. The theme that a society is fragile cannot be forgotten, and Katniss becomes aware of this point. Keeping her knowledge of Coin's motives to herself further distinguishes her as a hero, as this knowledge would dismantle the not-even-yet constructed society that was emerging. It is her final act that authentically characterizes her as the mockingjay. I like the irony that she fully becomes the mockingjay by destroying the person who demanded she be it in the first place.<br /><br />The use of symbolism and foreshadowing throughout the book is inarguable and more proof that Collins was in control as a novelist. I give this book five stars for both its entertainment value and its literary merit.
0307946711|4.0|I attempted One Day several times. The beginning was difficult to get through and I had to put it down several times only to come back a few days later. However, Once I did I was hooked. I love the concept, love Em and Dex together and apart, love London. Thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
0756404746|5.0|This book (and the second book as well) are masterpieces.  The best series I have read in many years, and that includes everything from Brandon Sanderson and George R.R. Martin.  The characters are very deep, the magic system is complicated and immersive.  The \\"slow\\" parts of the book are slow like a lazy Sunday on the porch with a beer and cigar, rather than the usual necessary but torturous plot building of other books.<br /><br />I maintained a constant internal argument as I read this book.  One part of my brain was saying \\"slow down, you need to savor this\\" while the other part of me said \\"Go faster, I need to know what happens\\".<br /><br />The worst thing I can say about this book is that it will leave you desperate for more.  Everything you read will be washed out, your fantasy life will feel so empty amidst your deep need for something similar...that just does not exist.  This book is the heroin of fantasy books, everything you have read before this book will be a joke and everything you read afterwards will lack flavor and meaning.<br /><br />Damn your beautiful mind Rothfuss, you have ruined me...damn you.
0345803507|5.0|I need to reread it; I know I sped through some parts too fast to fully appreciate them. It was...more than I expected, already, though.<br />Best book from the Fifty trilogy by far. This story, those books, they grabbed me and ran... fast and I haven't looked back. So glad I picked them up. So glad they are now a part of my life. Loved them.<br /><br />It may not be the best written or most creative, but James seduced me with her story and I am forever grateful she did.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Hard to put down, I became involved with the characters as they were friends.  I was disapointed when i finished the series that the story could not go on.  The book is so intriguing it was a real page turner.
0345803493|4.0|Honestly, I don't remember much of this book because I raced through it to get to the third. I could not put it down. Yes, the sex is repetitive and yes, you could kind of see where the plot was going but this book was so much more than the sex it's infamous for. So much more. I will be re-reading it and probably re-reading it a few more times. Fifty has become a part of my life and I am not ashamed to admit it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I couldnt put this book down, only because I wanted to know what else could possibly happen. I dont like how the story drags a little bit and i dont think their scenario is very believable. But I highly recommend these books. It does get a little old and you find yourself only reading them to see what else could happen in the bedroom, at least that was my case. Ive never had a book be so meh, yet I couldnt put it down!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app so much some of the games r really challenging but they r funnn its a good app just to sit on the couch and play!!!!(;
B0028RXXE8|5.0|If you haven't seen Rome then you can more or less ascertain that the series focuses on the tumultuous period in history where Caesar overthrew the senate, rose to power, and was inevitably betrayed by those around him. It's a classic, historical tale told here in a manner that is unlike any other. Rome has a take-no-prisoners mentality and it's not afraid to show the raunchier side of the ancient capital. Aside from the blood, boobs, and sex there are thankfully solid scripts and powerful performances backing every scene and action.<br />Once you start watching it you'll be unable to put the show down until the final episode brings about the bloody conclusion.
0345803493|2.0|I got the 3rd book in this trilogy and I ordered the 2nd book.  What do I do now?<br />I need the 2nd book!  PAT
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun to play but I wish you didn't have to buy actual money inside the game,which of course I will not do but it kinda sets you back.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|almost like super Mario brothers for wii. except it's. way awsomer and the best part is that it's. free!!!!!!!!! I could play it all day!!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The writer has a very unusual way of story telling. I got hooked onto from the first page. This is a trilogy and am reading the second one now.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Definitely an interesting and fun book. Unevenly paced, however. I wish that the writer would remove about 30 pages of overly-worded descriptions. The ending was a bit strange, but I'd say that the last 25% of the book had a really nice pace, filled with some cool twists and turns.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I as mother, decided to read this after my seventeen year old daughter purchased the trilogy on MY KINDLE! I have to agree with her it was an \\"Awesome\\" book!  Between the \\"starving\\" District 12 and the \\"elaborate, over the top\\" Capitol, really makes our young people of today think! Although, it was very disturbing with the killing of children, I believe that is what grabbed our young readers. Who am I kidding, it also grabbed an older reader, I will be starting the second book a.s.a.p.!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|While the product isn't perfect (the touch-bezel technology isn't I-pod technology), this gadget has made running even more fun.  It takes only moments for the watch to synch with the satellites.  The heart rate monitor - I expected the strap around my chest to be uncomfortable - I hardly know it's there.  It tells me how fast I'm running - either in MPH, KmPH, or minutes per mile/kilometer.  The virtual partner is an excellent motivator, and the auto scroll gives you all this information in a relatively short period of time (which you get to set).  Battery life is better than I expected.  I wish I'd bought this item years ago, and I'm recommending it to all my running friends!
0345803485|5.0|This book was absolutely FANTASTIC! After hearing the media talk about this book for the past few months, I decided to download and begin reading. This book was so engaging that I had the hardest time putting it down.....even to sleep....I couldn't wait to finish. I literally finished this book in less than 24 hrs.<br /><br />I wish I could articulate how the book made me feel. I felt as though I could feel Ana's anxiety, apprehension. I could feel her desire for Christina. I related so well to the characters....although clearly Christian has some issues. Their affair was HOT HOT HOT! There was so much hotness it almost became overwhelming for me.  I'm glad that although this book is considered an erotic romance there was actually a story line. Most often that's not the case. Additionally, the book provided some insight into a different lifestyle that I know nothing about. I found it very intriguing which I guess was the intent ;-) At any rate, I encourage everyone to read the book. It's a quick read and you are definitely in for a wild ride.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the different reading plans and devotionals there are to choose from. with this app I can read anywhere.
0345803493|4.0|I clearly enjoyed the first book so much that I could not wait to start the 2nd. I must say that I didn't enjoy this as much. I got overwhelmed by all of the drama in the story line that made me constantly wonder \\"how can Ana stay in this 'relationship'?\\"  While I was captivated by their love story, the drama just became too much for me which made me wonder how realistic could this be. That being said, the way the story ended I will immediately start the 3rd one. I just have to know what happens!!<br /><br /> It's still a very HOT book and I would recommend.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I love the game but one of my challenges is to visit another village when I try yo go to it I am told I need to update it will not update please fix this.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|To me, this is a near perfect album, with only a couple of weak spots.  I am not that crazy about the song \\"Knights of Shame\\", but the remainder of the album is solid.  Like other reviewers, my interest in the group was piqued by the song \\"Sail\\", which sounds so new and different when compared with just about everything else that you hear on the radio.  I was somewhat disappointed to learn that the song is about alien abduction, but I believe that the lyrics actually have deeper meanings.  And I believe that this is also true for much of the album; the meanings behind some of the lyrics can be difficult to tease out, but that's what great music is all about (like R.E.M. for example).  The song \\"It's Not Your Fault\\" is another of their hits from the album, where Aaron Bruno combines falsettos with screaming singing in a way that is fascinating and infectious to listen to.  Aaron seems to pour his soul into each song; I read an interview where he supposedly wrote every song on the album.  The songs range from raging party dancers like \\"Burn it Down\\" to sweet touching ballads like \\"All I Need\\" that incoporates choir voices.  \\"People\\" is another of my favorites, along with \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Kill Your Heroes\\".  Another professional reviewer was \\"confused\\" by the album because it went in so many directions, and didn't know whether to rate the album as potential genius or potential disaster.  My opinion is that it is closer to genius; the varied directions of the songs are refreshing and exciting.  I get tired of buying albums for one song, and finding out the rest of the album consists of weaker and lamer variations of the same song and they all wind up sounding the same.  Perhaps the \\"schizophrenic\\" nature of the album can be blamed on Mr. Bruno's A.D.D., and let's hope that it continues.
1594484805|4.0|This book is excellent! I bought it because my thesis director recommended it and I'm more than happy. The only thing I didn't like was the material of the book. It seems very cheap paper, for sure not the best edition, but still ok.
B00634GHJA|5.0|One of the most useful things I have on my phone. Galaxy Nexus is not direct connection friendly and some apps are just too much of a hassle to use. This is very straight forward and quick. Highly recommend especially for nexus phones.
B00003CXAT|5.0|For a thrilling action adventure movie for all ages you can't get much better than this original Steven Spielberg classic.  For one of the first times, dinosaurs look real.  Mixing animatronics and CGI every carnivore is menacing as hell.  The opening sequence will definitely get your attention and once everyone reaches the island, the suspense is sustained.<br /><br />Adapted from Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, multi-millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park on an island near Costa Rica unlike any other.  He and his scientists have found a way to clone extinct plants and animal DNA using blood from mosquitoes captured in amber millions of years ago.  He brings dino-diggers Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to the island to help him convince his investors represented by attorney Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) that the idea is solid and that is successfully nearing completion.<br /><br />Several monkey-wrenches are thrown into the mix to put everyone at risk from the meat eaters.  To complicate matters further Hammond's 2 spunky grandchildren are along for the ride adding a different element of risk.<br /><br />For those who have a decent home theater, I would urge you to watch this on a Blu ray disc.  It is only available as of this writing as part of the \\"Ultimate Collection.\\"  It will give the dinosaur's roar and foot stomps the proper treatment, not to mention a beautiful picture.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Did not think I would enjoy this game at first, but now I can not put this game down. It is way to addicting. Atleast give it a try, you never know you might enjoy it. I know that I have.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|I downloaded it no problem and then it wouldn't let me play due to no Internet connection even though I do. stupid... I was really wanting to play too
B004WR125O|5.0|Love this little adapter. Great feature on the Onkyo, but we returned the receiver and did not need this. It is low profile, and worked flawlessly.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun and addicting to play. I play it with my 4yr old son who loves the movies. The game is challenging without being to difficult for kids. Only watch out if kids are playing. They can buy items with real money if you don't set parental controls. I use kids place. Also to exit game just go to options and the arrow at the bottom of the screen appears so you can exit it. Enjoy!

B005723JSQ|5.0|Great! I stayed glued til I finished it. I laughed and could relate.<br />I hsve read othrr books by this author and will continue to check out new releases.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is a great book, a must read for any runner, wanna-be runner, or any individual interested in expanding their horizon. A great story about lifestyles and motivation.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love playing though takes some time to build up the town wish that it didn't take so many whacks with the ax to chop a tree down depletes all energy too quick
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is great. my kids an I play daily I would recommend to everyone and I have not had to spend any money.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|She bites her lip, she rolls her eyes, her inner goddess?  Pretty corny, not sexy.  There isn't much of a story line just a lot of erotica.  I was very disappointed with the weak characters and lack of engaging scenes.  Very disappointed.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I loved this book, no doubt about it.  The title is a little deceiving though, as the story is not really focused on `the girl with the dragon tattoo,' Lisbeth Salander, but paves the way for some fantastic sequels that are focused, almost exclusively Salander.  She is one of my favorite characters that I've read in long time.
B007CKNX28|4.0|It's a bit surprising to think that Blunderbuss is Jack White's first proper solo album, coming as it does at an age where people start to think less of what's coming next and more of what's been left behind, especially given White's indisputable figurehead status. Few would consider acts like the Raconteurs and the Dead Weather as bands that just happen to have Jack White in them, and fewer still would associate the White Stripes with Meg. Yet here Mr. White is, at age thirty-six, releasing an album that turns that iconic, rock-god-on-a-pedestal status on its head and in the process unshackles him emotionally in a way that has to be incredibly freeing and, for his audience, particularly engaging. Blunderbuss has no problems hitting a visceral note again and again: it's his freest record, musically speaking, and in its bloodstained lyrics, which run the gamut from cautionary to vindictive to self-loathing, it opens up a side of White that previously has been impenetrable, wrapped up in his own self-mythologizing persona as he was. There's nothing opaque about opener \\"Missing Pieces,\\" which starts off with White realizing he has a nosebleed and wondering if he has a disease within the first few couplets and only gets worse from there. \\"I woke up and my hands were gone, yeah / I looked down and my legs were long gone / I fell forward with my shoulder, but there's nobody there,\\" White howls, and if it's a bit of an obvious metaphor for the loss of a relationship, then Blunderbuss is perhaps the most straightforward break-up record in recent memory. \\"Someone controls everything about you / and when they tell you that they just can't live without you / they ain't lyin', they'll take pieces of you,\\" White sings near the end of \\"Missing Pieces,\\" and it's as good of a thesis for this record as any.<br /><br />White is in full take-no-prisoners mode here: at one point he equates love to twisting a knife in his guts (\\"Love Interruption\\"); at another, he tells off a lover and leaves no room for an argument: \\"you broke your tongue talking trash, and now you try to bring your garbage to me / I got some words for your ass, you better find someone else off the street\\" (\\"Trash Tongue Talker\\") - you can almost see the sneer on his face as he spits into the microphone. There's the recent divorce from singer/model Karen Elson and the early retirement of Meg White, easy signposts to point to here, yet Blunderbuss is more universal than any of White's personal problems. \\"No responsibility, no guilt or morals cloud her judgment,\\" White describes an unidentified female on \\"Freedom at 21,\\" and this is the warning that Blunderbuss so liberally dispenses - Beware the Heartbreaker. Yet wrapped up all of this is White's own guilt: his headstrong, irrepressible desire; how he wants \\"love to walk right up and bite me\\" on \\"Love Interruption;\\" how he ends up \\"throwing up, a lifesaver down my throat\\" on \\"Sixteen Saltines.\\" White remains eternally complicit in his own angst. It's the typical two sides of the coin, his unflinching look at his own romantic failures adding a fulfilling dimension to the warding off of the she-devil that White seems perpetually engaged in, and it's one anyone whose had a relationship turn on them can sympathize with.<br /><br />It's an intimacy that is bolstered by Blunderbuss' forays into R&B and boogie-woogie shuffling amid the usual touchstones of blues and classicist rock `n roll. A song like the playful, jaunty \\"Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy\\" rightfully sounds more like the product of his fellow Raconteur Brendan Benson, yet White sounds comfortably at home in the carnival-esque tinkling of the keys and the jostling bar room atmosphere the song conjures. In its thinly veiled lyrical takedown of Meg, it continues a theme of Blunderbuss in shifting moods and amorphous soundtracks, adding another emotional layer to a highly emotional album. While \\"Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy\\" is undoubtedly retaliatory, that festive mood those bouncy keys create cements the song as a celebration, not just mean-spirited revenge: \\"And you'll be watching me girl, takin' over the world,\\" White croons, defiantly getting in the last word. Other songs are more direct, like first single \\"Sixteen Saltines,\\" whose trashy stomp is perfect for the \\"lipstick, eyelash, broke mirror, broken home\\" characterization of its female antagonist. Through it all, White doesn't waste a note, and his dexterity is something to marvel at.<br /><br />Last track \\"Take Me With You When You Go\\" is a fitting end for the album - it starts off as a beseeching two-step, lightly accented with backing vocals and careful drum brushes before doing a 180 on its apology with an insistent riff and a bone-rattling guitar solo. It's a nice little capsule review of what's come before, uneasy and raw and slightly unhinged, and it's just what White has always been: hard to pin down. That final refrain, though, where White begs \\"take me with you when you go, girl / take me anywhere you go,\\" is disarmingly forward and even has a touch of the hopelessly romantic, continuing the lyrical unveiling of the man behind the curtain. White has always stood for a certain ideal, a reminder of rock's history and the careful construction of a persona that has always gone hand-in-glove with a proper Rock Star. On Blunderbuss, it's as bewitchingly difficult as it's always been to tell where White is going, but Jack White the person has never been as close to his audience as he is here.s create cements the song as a celebration, not just mean-spirited revenge: \\"And you'll be watching me girl, takin' over the world,\\" White croons, defiantly getting in the last word.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I have to admit that I'm a minority here, but I didn't really like this book.  I thought the writing was juvenile and simplistic (and I know that it was intended for a younger audience, but there is a definite difference between this and the Harry Potter books, which were also intended for a younger audience, but contained prose that was much more challenging for the younger readers.)  Certainly the subject matter warrants a book for an older audience than the writing in this book seems to indicate.  This would be like the `Dick and Jane' books being rewritten as `Dick kills Jane' (with his bare hands, no less).<br /><br />Now, that first paragraph addresses the subject matter, not the actual `violence.'  Although this book is `violent,' the violence is glossed over--both in description and in the impact on the kids.  These are kids killing other kids, for heaven sake, and the psychological impact on those doing the killing and witnessing the deaths of other youngsters, is not delved into in any great detail, such that it was not realistic at all.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|it started out pretty fun....til it reset on me and now the time on all my buildings &amp; items etc are now 456 hours. boooooo!!!!
B00319ECGU|5.0|Even if you've already seen the series, this is a must for any collector. The Blu-Ray is very sharp, with both video and audio remastering. Special features include some featurettes & behind-the-scenes input, and the packaging itself is pretty nice. Whether you've seen them a hundred times, or never got around to them, the Dirty Harry collection is a great addition to your Blu-Ray Library, especially at the price (I paid ~$26.00).
