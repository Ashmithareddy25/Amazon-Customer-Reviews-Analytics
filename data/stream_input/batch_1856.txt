B002GMNLKQ|5.0|Delivered on time, and CD is brand new in good condition.Would purchase again from this seller. Can't give feedback on band since this CD is not for me, it is a  present for a teenager that likes this group.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I love the game but the updates come late. I mean I have waited for an update but they never come. I mean my mom has already tri-gnomed the new doofensmirtz level pack and not to mention the new level pack that is supposed to be here! So just bring the updates!
0805080120|5.0|I found this book to be a fascinating read. The book is about how language develops. Early on, the author mentions three forces are responsible for the way languages change: economy, expressiveness, and analogy. The rest of the book then goes into detail about how these forces work.<br /><br />For example, in explaining economy the author writes about how ancient European languages tended to use p's in a lot of the places that we use f's today. The reason that we have changed to f's-- like pisk--> fish-- is because f's only require you to move your tongue half way up your mouth in contrast to p's which require you to block your mouth completely.<br /><br />Other sections in this book, include an extended discussion on the role of metaphors (basically every word starts out as something physical, and then sometimes get abstracted into prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs) and a discussion of the templates of the Semitic languages. Both of these sections are thoroughly engaging, and very well written.<br /><br />I think that this book would be best for people who already have an interest in language. There are frequent discussions about Latin and French, and although it's not necessary to know how to speak these languages, I found it useful to at least have a high school exposure to them. In general I feel like I have a much better understanding of language having read this book-- it's truly an incredible story!

034580404X|5.0|I find getting into books really hard I generally don't read, but I must say these books are really good. It does contain a lot of sex but it's the story behind all of that. There is a real love story almost fairtail like.  I hope that she continues to write stories simular to this
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|My son likes this show. He will be happy to have them on dvd.This one was hard to find.I was glad it was on here.
B00664AM5C|1.0|While I didn't see this particular blu-ray version of the film (caught it on TV) I was completely let down by this movie.  I've recently gotten back into the zombie/infection/end of mankind genre.  And this movie just seemed to have such good potential, but never really seemed to deliver.  I think it suffered from too many side stories and didn't develop any of them fully.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Never before have I been so pleasantly surprised by the actual quality of writing in a zombie-themed book. Go, Max.
075669812X|5.0|I bought this book for my 6-yr old grandson (he is an advanced reader).  He absolutely LOVES it.  What's more, his 3-yr old brother likes it too.  The book seems to cover all the bases and it is well put-together, not cheap or shabby.  If your child is into Ninjago at all, he or she will come back to this book again and again.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I really like this album from Coldplay even though I had to play it several times for it to grow on me. I believe their best music hasn't been created yet, but they will pull it off. There's not one bad song on this album, and each song reaches a higher melodic quality when I listen to them all over again. When I listen to this album when I work out, it feels as if the band is standing all around me playing live as I ride my stationary bike. Coldplay really knows how to be extremely melodic and catchy. I hope they continue too see how perfectly melodic they can really be like Def Leppard and Queen.
B008220D5K|5.0|I liked this better than Knocked Up, and I loved Knocked Up. I took my girlfriend to see this because she too loves Knocked Up. I think every time the E channel plays it, she watches it. So I walked into this movie knowing I would at the very least find it funny.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Judd Apatow since I watched Freaks and Geeks when it was on the air. At that time I was in High School with my sister and was able to relate to that show and its characters. This movie is no different and I found it very easy to relate to this couple, minus having kids. All of Judd Apatow's work seems to be very character driven. Some have complained that this movie is just a bunch of characters and no real plot, I disagree. Granted it may not have the typical and conventional structure that most films have with a first, second and third act, but this movie flows well and seamless as one scene segues into another. That makes it very easy to watch and also rewatch as it isn't so typical and usual in that regard. This movie has similar scenes to Knocked Up which I thought was pulled off well without coming off as formulaic. Both have drug induced hotel scenes, a birthday party, kids fighting in a car, a club scene, and unexpected pregnancies. There is also a great fart scene which I found very easy to relate to as my girlfriend also finds it disgusting when I do it in bed.<br /><br />Paul Rudd tends to play the same characters a lot but this is easily my favorite performance of his to date. Leslie Mann also gives her best performance in this movie and also gets naked, but I fear her nude scenes maybe CGI which is to me a new and scary Hollywood trend. At any rate, they play off each other very well, are very real and easy to relate to and most importantly, they are both very funny in This Is 40! All the supporting cast is great too, although underused. John Lithgow gives a believable and great performance as well as Albert Brooks. Lena Dunham and Chris O'Dowd and Jason Segel are underused but great in their roles. Megan Fox is watchable and actually gives a passable performance which I would attribute to Judd Apatow's skill as a director. I was kind of bummed that there wasn't a brief cameo by Seth Rogen or Katherine Heigl, but it didn't really bother me that much.<br /><br />This movie is paced well, doesn't drag, is funny, has meaning and really is just a great movie. Judd Apatow's real life kids play the kids in this movie just as they did in Knocked Up, and also are really great and believable in their parts. If I believed in the whole Oscars bulls#@* I'd say this movie deserves some. It achieved the rare feat of being a comedy with real heart that establishes mood, intent, meaning and purpose. It tells the story of what love is. Everything from family love to the love between a married couple and what it takes to make a marriage work and that marriage actually takes work, as does the love that comes with it. Relationships aren't easy, but they're worth it which this movie does a great job of conveying.<br /><br />I loved the show Lost and oddly there are a lot of references to that show in this movie which surprised me and I loved it.<br />I thought this movie would be funny and good, but I was wrong. It was hysterical and brilliant and great. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed Knocked Up. I liked The 40 Year Old Virgin, Funny People and I think this is his best film to date. Telling another story about different characters from the world he created with Knocked Up was a great idea and focusing on the most interesting characters from that movie and giving them a movie of their own was a brilliant move and any fan of Judd Apatow should enjoy this movie. I highly recommend this movie and it was a great date movie. Most directors seem to do their best work early in their career and it's great to see that that isn't the case for Judd Apatow. This isn't really a Christmas movie but it does take place around the holiday so it is a fitting time of year to see it. I wonder if this will get turned into a trilogy? Even though I typically hate sequels (Ghostbusters II, worst sequel ever) I think this is best sequel I can think of in recent memory.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />There are great special features on this set:<br /><br />* 44 min.

B00AJRQLTI|2.0|Okay, you've got all these big movie names singing live.  Guess what?  They're so busy &#34;acting&#34; that they and the director forgot that it is about the music, not the acting. Some of them are passable, Jackman and Redmayne, but the rest just don't have the chops to sing this near operatic score.  Jackman belting out the last note of Let Him Live is joltingly off the mark.  It also seems too much of a strain on his vocal chords. Hathaway just can't sing very well and Siefred is just plain awful.  Maybe it all works while watching the film, but is sure doesn't only listening to it.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I bought this video to replace one that went missing from my collection of dvds. I also bought numerous others at the same time.
067144901X|5.0|My son LOVES Sandra Boynton's books, we have almost all of them in our collection. This one doesn't disappoint! It is a cute story with a fun rhyme. I have bought so many Boynton books as baby gifts I have lost count!!
B000MVIAUY|5.0|Nothing more to say, it is a wonderfully fun series and worth the purchase price.  Sam and Dear are our favorite go to on a boring evening!
0399230033|4.0|This is a fun story, but be warned several pages have no words and are simply pictures. My husband loves to &#34;read&#34; it to our young toddler as he can tell a different story each night. The pictures/artwork is nice.
1401223176|5.0|Wow, what an excellent comic. First and foremost, the artwork is beautiful and the scenes picked to show the story are astounding. These guys did their homework to bring you one of the best comics for the dark knight. If you are not completely familiar with Batman's history, be prepared to be a little bit lost with some of the details but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. This story is not for children so only get this for your kids if you are comfortable with them seeing action movies. There are no curse words but there is a little blood. Great gift for the batman fan in your life. They will be happy with this one. You know a comic is good when you wish that it had been longer and it is lengthy title.
0062086529|3.0|Was looking for some new board books for our toddler. Friend recommended this one....cute story, but it is not good for my young toddler as the story is a little too advanced with imagination. I m sure he will love it hn he is older, but I wouldn't recommend it for under 3
1401229921|2.0|Hush is not intended to be read like this. This lacks the colors and detail of the original. Some of the panels are extremely detailed and this pen and ink look only detracts from the depth that comes with colors. Only get this if you are a die hard fan and have the original
0140120416|5.0|I started Russian study from scratch at my local community college.  Russian is tough, period.  Our teacher (a Russian) wanted us to use this book.  I found the progressive instruction well laid out and at several points you were allowed to \\"catch your breath.\\"  No, the book does NOT give complete detailed instruction  of  each case system with all the inflections, just the basics, and yes, complex case levels are somewhat split up , more complicated material later in the book.<br /><br />  Russian has strict \\"comma rules\\" and of all of my five texts, this is the ONLY one that carefully describes these important rules, in ch. 26.  Not even the Schaum grammar, which is massive, addresses comma rules.<br /><br />  But here is a goody that is surprisingly overlooked:  The Table of Contents and Index are the most thorough I have seen in this type of text, and the reader is referred to specific pages and/ or section of chapter, not just to some vague reference that leaves you thrashing through dozens of pages.  There is an excellent Eng/RU dictionary, enough text and conversation material to be helpful, and nice grammatical tables although there are never enough of these.<br /><br />  Changes since Russian political restructure can  make  bits of dialogue out of date but this is not an issue with me.<br /><br />  I also use PIMSLEUR'S excellent CD system , and have used Complete Russian by West, and Colloquial Russian I and II, by Le Fleming and Kay;  each has merits, but I keep using this Penguin book by Brown for reference and help - it is physically falling apart now!<br /><br />  Finally,  Excellent practical, friendly supplementary books are 501 VERBS, 5000 RUSSIAN WORDS, and Schaum's RUSSIAN GRAMMAR  ( The latter book is scary but good reference, loaded with exercises)  Finally, the RUSSIAN 750 VERBS by Zauber is superb, sort of a written Pimsleur, with about 3,000 sentences, easy to use, in English alpha. order, and with wonderful tables of prefixes and other goodies.  All these books cheap.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I don't understand why they can't incorporate special features on just one blu-ray disc. It is annoying and disappointing, no wonder digital media is winning but i digress. Also, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight should have a menu instead of just starting the movie. It isn't a deal breaker but is very annoying. On a positive note, trailers for other movies are removed which is wonderful. The films are spectacular and you could tell when they incorporate the IMAX scenes for some of the bigger scenes. The audio isn't super as a standalone so if you have an audio system, set it up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This third patt compliments the first two parts with holding the reader's full attention to the end. You cac't put it down until the finish.

B001AGXEAG|5.0|I liked this movie for it's innovation as far as a blend of comedy and horror. Though Michael Keaton is never too scary!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|great package and movie experience, well worth the purchase and price. can't wait for the sequel and tv show that is in production
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Worst image I have ever taken, app sucks, the picture is fuzzy and you cannot really see what you are taking a picture of. I should have looked at the app closer before I bought it.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|best horror show ever and even better it has zombies. well directed and great creator with well thought out characters
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Wow this girl has some pipes! Didn't really know what to expect from this album because Ellie Goulding dances between genres a bit, which is what makes her music so unique. I'm not really a lyrics girl, but I've listened to this album enough times to deduce that it's a breakup album-a very, well-written break-up album. Every bit of it is as sad as it is great!
B007TK77QE|5.0|An excellent story line. Well written with good use of English language. Hope J k continues to write more adult books.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|very good story line all the way thru all five books, i would recomend series to anyone who likes adventure.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I read this as a kid and I've enjoyed it more now as an adult. It is much easier to understand the language now.
B000HZD08M|5.0|highly stylized,  female futuristic and thankfully not all about violence,  though there is some violence .. they are revolutionaries<br />in a future time when people no longer have children.  The connection between she and her ex lover lasts through time...<br />and her fantastic abilities save the world.  Charlize is a great actor,  and statuesque woman,  perfect for this super woman<br />caught in a troubled life...  Much better than say, Angelina Jolie in Laura Croft.  Charlize is a bit colder,  and so is perfect<br />for this character.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Great movie came really fast, it was sealed just as expected therefore I think that this deserved the stars which it required.

B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I recommend this book to someone who is looking for a funny book it is a very good. Children novel I loved it and I bet you will to
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This is one of the better movies, full of action and heartwarming thoughts.  The stars are excellent actors.  We will probably watch it again and again, and have already watched it twice.
0865478767|2.0|Cute title, but if you are not a translator or such but just someone curious about languages, you might find this book painfully boring. There are many nuggets of general interest, but buried in a sea of blah, blah, blah. I'm not returning this book because after paying return postage there would only be enough left for a burger and fries.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|This series is really a glimpse at what goes on in WA that most of us don't even suspect.  I want to get the second season and watch it on DVD .
B004IV32HU|4.0|As sometimes happens to biopics, the story is somewhat straightforward and simple-minded. Landau and Depp are brilliant as Bela Lugosi and Ed Wood.
B005CMSDLE|4.0|Great movie with a twist you don't expect. Love the soundtrack, too! An enjoyable way to wile away a couple hours.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|another gadget!  works well with both Kindles.  Now while one is charging, I can read on the other one! Love both.
B003297I1U|5.0|We received this crane and were very pleased with it. Our grandson is probably going to sleep with it, it is so great!! It also came in so quickly, I thought it was shipped 2 day air or somehow else special like that!!
B0091LS07E|5.0|My brother who's in the USMC loves this Singer/Song Writer so i bought this for him and he is very happy with it and listens to it often. I recommend this to anyone into R&B !
B000JMKO3C|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I am a fan of his writing. The only thing I didn't like was the ending seemed a little abrupt.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|If you have a Kindle you have to have this cable to connect the Kindle to your computer.  Why it isn't included I'll never know!!!
0399215921|2.0|I was so looking forward to giving this to my toddler nephew, but very disappointed when I received it.  The mini size (4\\" x 5\\") should be included in the initial description, not buried under \\"dimensions\\" at the bottom  Though I love the story, this is not the one to read with a kid on your lap.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Another fantastic movie.  The only thing wrong with it is there won't be any more HP books or movies, unless JK Rowling decides to add more.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Wonderful story of adventure and growth.  It touched me deeply and I felt the power with which the author wrote this parable.  It has great meaning to those who are seeking the road to their higher selves.  Thanks Paulo Coelho for this wonderful book.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|A fantastic movie.  You can't go wrong with anything Harry Potter, not now, not ever.  Books, movies and games are great.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating for this dvd.Sound quality, action and overall quality was great! All the actors did a fine job,only I wished Jet Li had a larger part.
B001DB0HG2|4.0|It's ok, not the greatest read, but not the worst either.  Guess I was expecting something different.  But again it's ok.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I gave this product a 5 star rating. The audio really gave my theater system a work out. The plot was great ,a regular screw up in the military later becomes a hero. The joint training exercises of the Navy were truly realistic. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys seeing the Navy in action.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This is another great HP movie as they all are.  Everyone should see and read all the HP books and movies.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|4 - Hour Chef is a must own book period. It will transform how you approach cooking and overall life completely.

B0063IH60K|4.0|if there was a paid version I would buy it immediately<br /> i hate all the ads but the game is worth it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great book. It truly tied everything together.<br /><br />At times I felt like the author started to rush the book to get to the end. Some things didn't seem to run smoothly.<br /><br />But overall, it all came together at the end. I wanted more....I did appreciate that the author gave another version of the book from another point of view at the end. But that only made me want more.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Seriously crap! I can't sync apps and the news feed is awful. It only shows the first dozen entries and then they get retarded and  blue. I didn't pay $200 to have cheap crappy apps. Please fix!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So intriguing from the first chapter.<br /><br />I was so upset with how the first one ended, because I of course want them together. This book picks right up from where the first book left off. That I appreciate. Didn't leave me waiting 4-5 chapters before they started talking about where there relationship was going.<br /><br />Grey is sooo complex...so complicated...but the one thing that is simple, is his love for her.  I just love how he shows it.<br /><br />I would read this book again!!
B00867GHS8|5.0|Willem Defoe is a bit more appropriate here than in Antichrist.  Probably better for children in this one.  Not sure.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  Love it. Great Quality.<br /><br />Definitely a worthy purchase as a collectors item.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B000AL5OZK|3.0|I bought this CD for one song, \\"Can't Shake Loose\\" which was (to me) the only hit on the CD.  The recording that you have on this CD of that song is a live version (which I didn't know before I bought it), but it sounds pretty true to the original.  You can't buy this one song on MP3 songs of Amazon (I tried); the rest of the songs are of varying degrees of pleasurable listening (but  didn't put any of the rest on my ipod collection).  She is a Swedish singer (used to be part of ABBA is my understanding), and her individual CD sounds just a pinch like them.  (So, if you like ABBA, you might like this CD).  I don't mean to bad mouth the CD, it is fine for what you get. Usually, with Amazon, you can preview the first 30 seconds of the songs to see if you like them, so you have no excuse if the CD doesn't meet your expectations.  However, I believe for this CD  I didn't have this option, so you just have to know the songs before you purchase.  I knew the one song and that is why I bought the CD (pretty expensive for one song).
B0074JODP8|5.0|If you like blues and rock melded together and performed by an extrordinary world class guitartist and complimented by an amazing band, playing so tightly together..........You won't be dissapointed with this concert. Great tunes, great feel, great execution, dynamics all add up to a true musical experience that you will watch over and over again.
B00062PN6I|4.0|After se some reviews and looking for a good head phones with low price, i could see a good price by amazon. I bough, i like a lot, but just one thing i do not like, i can not hear the low frequencies like the bass in the songs with quality it's so weak. For studio its not good but for your home devices yes.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|It was easy to become addicted to this series.  To see it on Blue Ray without commercials and breaks in the action is much better than watching it on cable.  Awesome.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is so funny, it is by far my favorite movie! Far Amy makes this movie the best movie ever!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works like a charm. I use it every morning. I get multiple alarm settings. Used it out of the country as well. Never had to worry about catching the bus.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|A great action movie with a surprise ending. It's kind of a sequel to the movie Lara Croft, Tomb Raiders
B008FPZQQU|1.0|In regards to the replacement of the cuts \\"Clotho,\\" \\"Lachesis,\\" and \\"Tank\\" from the DVD-A 5.1 Mix, to me it is also strange indeed, more so by the fact that when Steve Wilson re-mixed KING CRIMSON's [[ASIN:B003XTUZIC In The Wake Of Poseidon]] for 5.1 they also were missing multi-track reels for \\"The Devil's Triangle,\\" but were able to \\"painstakingly (remix it) from a stereo version.\\"  I guess Robert Fripp has more patience and regard for his past work......
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|A poor job on the Batman series.  I was not really existed about the movie.  It just did not have all of the things that make Batman work as a hero.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I am still reading this book and it has been holding my interest.  I have not completely figured out who the villians are, which is unusual for me.  Good read!
B002NWXRYY|4.0|It was really funny, you have to suspend reality, but that is what these films are for to help you forget.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Awsome, soothing and exciting all in one. Play it everynight to go to sleep by.  Best purchase I've made in a long time.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I was able to watch the first season on netflix and I enjoyed it enough but was relieved it was free because it didn't really grab me that much.<br /><br />However I was genuinely curious about what happened after the season finale so I bought just the first episode of the second season on Amazon and then the next...and the next. They really stepped up their story progression and I care about the characters more and  I really love how they keep creatively weaving in more and more fairy tales using them to make old and new character connections.<br /><br /> I am hooked now and have the whole second season.
1455809381|5.0|But...Don Corleone does not sound like Marlon Brando, as he does in &#34;Family Corleone&#34;<br />Often the 'voices' come out of nowhere to yell a curse or a phrase, and with 15-20 different voices, it is a bit disconcerting.<br />The book, of course, is a classic, and tells a wonderful story about thoughtful, precise, management of a business.  (Yeah, that's right...Godfather is a study in management techniques)<br />You see the way the story moves along, Vito's reaction to it, as well as pre-action to events yet to come.<br /><br />The item itself here:  the MP3 audiobook.  I love it.  There are only two discs, and they each run over 8 hours without having to change them.  The audio is perfect, and I highly recommend this method of buying.  Family Corleone, which I also review here, had 12 discs for about the same length of book....a lot of shuffling and changing.  MP3 is a nice way to go.<br /><br />The book itself, is the same as if you read it: unabridged: every word written by Puzo is here.  The difference becomes the tone of the characters.  I am still in the process of listening, but believe it will be a fine experience.<br /><br />WOG
B009GEFXLC|5.0|My roomate has been watching this from the beginning and I am a huge Nathan Fillion fan so I would catch it with him occasionally and fully enjoy it but I never cared for the unrequited Mulder/Scully thing between him and Becket so I never made an effort to watch consistently before.<br /><br />Then I caught the Season finale last year and saw they were going to just have them together and I was curious to see if it would work or descend into Moonlighting. I have to say it works very well and really fixed the show for me. I have been following all of season five and I make sure I never miss an epsiode. I think it is still very funny and interesting and having them together help not hurts.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Very nice takes good pictures and the pictures are clear. The video is great looking and stays on point, color real clear.Please keep up good work making the camera for the kindle fire, I love working on the kindle fire.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|The comedy in this is great without being too crude! It's just a feel good movie with an awesome soundtrack.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This was a gift for my grand son and I'm sure he will enjoy playing the game a long time.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|The Meta learning part alone is worth the money. What else do you want?<br /><br />It has 600 pages of useful information, ranging from learning stuff to cooking.<br /><br />I'm not really into the cooking part, i only bought it for the meta-learning,<br /><br />which was more than enough for me.
B001HN694K|5.0|Mia Wasikowska is the perfect Alice.  I love that Tim Burton didn't just do the same old story and I enjoy his quirky style.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was funny and cool I laughed hard and I want to read more of diary of a wimpy kid
B008VBYN80|3.0|Fun, but choppy interface for quests. Could be more streamlined. At least the items are not to expensive for expansion in storyline.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|If you like Rod Stewart, this album will not disappoint. Nice renditions of both old and new Christmas Classics.<br />Love Rod's voice. Favorite song on album Red Suited Santa.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I believe this is one of the best series I have read. The first two books were very exciting.You never wanted To put them down. Having seen the movie prior to reading the books,  I had a good review of theIr surroundings in the sectors from where they came.<br /><br />I would suggest this read for all ages.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|A classic for Christmas movie buffs, and movies in general. This is the original version before Ted Turner got his grubby hands on and colorized it.  Colorized version has nothing on the b&w.
B008J34466|5.0|This was. Christmas present and the receiver loved it! I love Pink and her music. I would recomend this CD to everyone.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I can not stop reading this book! Riordan has done an excelent job. I love the plot and all of the great details.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|This is a nice little piano game, in Guitar Hero style, but some songs require pressing three keys at once. With the Kindle Fire's limitation of only two presses, it is impossible to play the game. However, you can still listen to the songs.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />Just got this set and had a chance to watch a few favorite episodes. I also checked a disc from each season on my PC to see if indeed they were using single layer (4.7 Gig) DVD'S Or the correct Dual-Layer Disc (Approx 8.5 Gig) they are all Dual Layer disc! I read somewhere on the reviews that they used single layer disc, that reviewer is Wrong!<br /><br />I don't think u could even buy 32 blank Dual layer disc for under $25.00, so this may be one of the best deals I have ever got off Amazon.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Um...Where is A Little Fall of Rain? That's a really important plot moment in Les Miserables. If this isn't in the movie either, that's really upsetting.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Mostly nasty dancing. Crotches in faces. Like going to a strip show. Not as funny as preview indicates it was.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This app works well, my complaints would be I lost about 30 books when I had to reformat my tablet.  So that was a big bummer.  Secondly, it doesn't put the book you are currently reading at the top of the list.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|this was really a cute game it was one that even adults can enjoy it beings i am an adult no problems at all with the game was easy to  follow
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Chose this book  on a whim. It actually was a book that held your interest throughout. Predictable but happy ending!
1451688091|4.0|I am working my way through it. Nice to read that politicians used to work.<br />5 more words required. dumb
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I love a good zombie story. This book had good zombie stories. Its starts out slow,with some the stories being repetitive. However overall the stories vary. The stories at the space station,Yonkers, and northern Canada were my favorites.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I gave it 4 Stars only because Jason Bourne was not there. It was a sure 5 Star if his character was there.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|Engrossing from the very beginning. I love the concept of the calories companies, and the devastating result of genetically modified foods. The political intrigue and personal crisis of the characters are very well done. I found the ending very satisfying. I'm hoping there is more of this story in the future.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|batman once again is a brooding pussy who can't get it together, Bane was cool, but that was it, too far fetched.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I was concerned that these tracks would be \\"live\\" tracks but loved the music in the movie so much that I was willing to put up with it. These tracks were not \\"live\\" and some were even reworked for the album. If you loved the movie then you will love this album!
B009MO5ES8|2.0|I went to go see this at the movies and I have to say that this movie was a waste of time. The entire movie is JGL on a bike trying to deliver a package. No real action, suspense, nothing. Just a man on his bike! highly wouldn't recommend to anyone.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|This is one of the better piano apps I've seen, and it's fun, but it does have a few drawbacks.  To explain, I've listed 10 pros and ten cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1.  There are a lot of songs to choose from.<br />2.  It's a good device to encourage interest in studying music.<br />3.  The songs can be listened to prior to playing.<br />4.  There are different skill levels (easy, normal and hard).<br />5.  The piano keeps track of the grades you earn on each song, at each level (beginner, apprentice and expert).<br />6.  The different levels keep the app from getting boring.<br />7.  The piano uses chords, so it's more realistic than most piano applications that allow only one note to be pressed at a time.<br />8.  Although the product description indicates you should play this on a device that is at least 4 inches, it worked fine on the Kindle Fire.<br />9.  If you finish, the audience gives you a very nice round of applause.  If you get an \\"A\\" they clap with more enthusiasm!  :)<br />10.  The background picture on the menu is very beautiful.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.  If you make a mistake, the song will not advance until you hit the right key.  That's good for learning the right key, but it's terrible for helping you to learn how to keep time.  If you're playing a song, and you make a mistake, you're supposed to keep playing to maintain the integrity of the song.<br />2.  Actual note symbols and rests are not used, so you can't learn those.<br />3.  The duration of each song is posted.  However, if you make mistakes, it can take much longer to finish the song.<br />4.  Once you select a song, you're stuck in it until you finish it.  There is no escape key!  If the song you picked is too hard for your skill level it's frustrating.<br />5.  If you play one note of a chord correctly but another note incorrectly, the piano gives you credit for playing one note correctly, and makes you play the other note separately.  Since chords require the notes be played simultaneously, this isn't a good way to learn how to play chords.<br />6.  Since I'm on the subject of chords, playing three notes at one time is very challenging.  Getting the timing right when striking keys at the same time is not this difficult on an actual piano.<br />7.  As you press the \\"keys\\" you get comments such as \\"perfect,\\" \\"good,\\" \\"too late!\\" etc. floating up from the keyboard in vibrant colors, and with stars. If you play the correct \\"key(s)\\", a star floats up the screen, and if you play an incorrect key, a big red \\"X\\" floats up.  These graphics are a bit distracting.  (You can, however, turn these off in the options.)<br />8.  The note names (A, B, C, B flat, etc.) are on the piano \\"keys,\\" but the blocks that drop down from the top do not have the note names printed on them.  The game would be better if the app had the note names printed on the blocks, too.  At times, it is hard to tell where the note is headed, and having the note name on the block would help to teach the musical concepts.<br />9.  There is a narrow band, right above the \\"keys,\\" where the \\"note\\" must be positioned to have the computer acknowledge that you've played the note.  If you press a key too soon, the computer doesn't register the note.  You've gone on to play the next note, but the computer expects you to play the note again.  I guess two wrongs do make a right (ha, ha).<br />10.  The game doesn't have an option for more than one player, so if more than one player plays, the progress features become meaningless.ed simultaneously, this isn't a good way to learn how to play chords.<br />6.

030758836X|1.0|I got through about 19% of this book on my Kindle.  It took six months to read that much!  The story is slow and plodding. The characters are both unremarkable and unlikable. More to the point, their vacuous and vain in their own special ways. The story contains no message and it's not an entertaining read or one that you'll feel good about afterwards.  Book group members will probably have one question: How do I get the time I spent reading this drivel back?  Spend your money on something better.
0307346617|5.0|I enjoy Max Brooks work, and I really liked this book. If you are into the walking dead or the zombie genre you will too.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Great album. If you the greatest hit of this great artist you find it in this compilation. Not only for fans
B00005N6KG|1.0|the head phone doesn’t stay in my ears. the sound quality is just horrible. I hate this. Just put it in a box and never use it. don’t waste your money on this.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|This game is not as fun as the other angry birds games.  The space idea was just not exactly for me.
B009H442DG|5.0|I bought this for my wife. We are old enough to have seen Grease the first time. I gave it to her as an early Christmas present (she like Christmas music). She liked not only the songs, but the fact the proceeds were going to help others.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|got this for my grandson to play, I am not so interested but he likes it so, so far so good
B007SGLZP8|4.0|One of his better tales...you will love it! Great twists and turns and interesting characters kept me up late reading.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is nice to be able to get local weather at a moments notice, this makes it very easy to do that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't take credit for this line: The Walking Dead is bascially a soap opera with zombies thrown in for action, but it's true and I read that on a Netflix review. Then again, it's so much more. Almost every episode leaves you gasping for breath and wanting to immediately know more...the cliff hangers are almost unbearable. The cast works together beautifully to make you really care about the characters and how the situation they are in is going to affect them emotionally and physically. You will find yourself wondering how you would react if you were in a similar situation. I don't know how many of us would survive without our Internet and electricity. Shoot, I don't even want to try. And living vicariously through Rick, Lori, Carl, Daryl, Carol, Glen, Hershel, and Maggie every episode is more than enough. My hats off to the writers, producers, and directors who make this such an incredible show!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is OK to use but I still prefer the laptop or desktop for working as I c an't see well enough to use the tablet for working. That said it is easy to get updates and reviews from the tablet wherever I am instead of having to take the laptop with me when I am out and about.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Well what is there to say.  This is one of my favorite childhood movies. It stands the test of time it manages to make me laugh and even some suspense. Good for and adults.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|This app does not teach you to play the piano. Instead it's a game where you can make some really fine sounding Christmas music using one, two or three fingers at a time by watching where black and white bars that drop from the top of the screen are going to hit, anticipating them, and pressing the keys at the appropriate time.<br /><br />There is both positive and negative visual reinforcement as you progress through the songs like \\"Good!\\", \\"Great!\\", \\"Perfect!\\" and also warnings like \\"Too Late!\\" or a red \\"X\\" for mistakes. At the end of the song you receive a round of applause, a letter score A, B, C, D, E or F and some point and combo statistics about your rendition of the piece.<br /><br />If you think of this as teaching you to play the piano and you know you don't know how to play the piano, you will easily be discouraged. If you view it as a game where you must just synchronize your one finger, two and three finger combo screen touches with the moving bars, you will see that this is indeed JUST A GAME with the sweet reward being that you WILL be making music.<br /><br />It's fun and there are 28 different songs, but it does get harder as there are 4 difficulties ranging from Very Easy through Hard. The one thing that it does have in common with learning to play the piano is that it takes practice. Each time you do it you'll get better.<br /><br />Varied choice of classic songs, although there's a few pretty obscure ones that I would have liked to see replaced with more popular ones. The games is fun to play around with. It takes up only 3.05MB installed. It will be easier and more fun on devices with bigger, wider screens that enlarge the keyboard. Controls worked well and the songs sounded pretty impressive on my Fire 8.9 HD. Since some of the harder songs require you to touch 3 fingers to the screen at the same time to play chords, both of the new Fire HD's will handle this since the screens allow for 10 point capacitive touch. Some devices including the regular Fire will only recognize 2 of the 3 touched keys.<br /><br />I think some kids could really impress Mom, Dad or the grandparents for Christmas with this app by PRACTICING up on a few of these songs. I liked the game and the music. I hated the \\"trap\\"(See below).<br /><br />THE TRAP:<br />Once you pick a song to play, you're trapped in it until you finish playing the entire song all the way through. There's an option to just \\"Listen\\" to the song but even if you pick that, you will be in a loop of listening to just that ONE song or forced to play it through to get to different song.<br />The workaround is to cheat: Select to play the song on \\"Expert\\" because then it doesn't stop and wait for you to hit the correct keys and once the song finishes you can start over with a different one.lar Fire will only recognize 2 of the 3 touched keys.<br /><br />I think some kids could really impress Mom, Dad or the grandparents for Christmas with this app by PRACTICING up on a few of these songs.

B0049J3QNG|5.0|There is nothing to dislike about this movie.  If you have not watched it yet what are you waiting for!
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I love the musical but not the long-length book.  Ordered by mistake, but fine since it is free.  Thank you!
B0001I562I|5.0|My nephews and nieces enjoyed the whole program.  Great viewing and I'll order more itiems as the weeks ahead require it.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Too much time spent setting up next movie and looking at logistics of how Aaron Cross comes to be and functions rather than seeing him at work.  Should have started with him on a mission and ended with him firing a warning shot at those coming after him.  Weak transition from Bourne trilogy but still worth watching.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This product is a Christmas gift.  Love that I could shop from home and receive products at my home before Christmas
B0064BWDRW|4.0|Good quality work from Nesbo - continues but possibly brings to a close the Harry Hole series. Maintains the suspense but probably gets a little far fetched in some of the scenes. Good reading though.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have this app on my iphone & love it . I got it for my kindle fire hd & it never loads anything more than  the most recent 4 status.<br /><br />I recently noticed that someone fixed all the bugs. Love this now more than ever. Couldn't ask for better. 5 stars *****
B001E75QH0|5.0|Harrison Ford is at this best in these 4 classic action/adventure films; just wonderful to watch over and over again as Indy goes on one adventure after the next -- uncovering the ark of the covenant, recovering mystic stones, searching for the holy grail and getting mixed up in a mess with the crystal alien skull. Great mix of adventure with comedic elements and also family friendly. I grew up watching these films and love to watch them over and over; they are so good they never get old. The best of the 4 is Last Crusade, then Raiders of the Lost Ark, then somewhat of a tie between Crystal Skull (weird alien thing going on) and Temple of Doom (weird voo doo stuff).
0241953235|5.0|The book was better than described. A favorite from my childhood - just as great as an adult :)<br />Hopefully a new favorite for my daughter.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I've always enjoyed watching STAR TREK, but this new take/twist on the STAR TREK franchise took it to a whole new level and new generation of fans. I was actually crying during the opening scene of the film -- it was THAT powerful/impactful -- and I still cry when I watch it now. Saw it in the theater and have watched it 2-3x since buying this DVD. Very well-acted, well put together, fresh plot, tons of action and excitement, lots of dry humor from Bones -- just an overall great film. The best part was showing the flashbacks of Spock and Kirk so you really got a sense of the trials they faced as children and how it defined the men they became. This is a must-have, must-see movie for any action/adventure/sci-fi fan.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|I wish I was Thomas Crown.  Rich bored and exciting.  As long as the world keeps turning he can keep ticking
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I've enjoyed both new Bond movies (Casino Royale & Quantum of Solace) with Daniel Craig as a &#34;rougher&#34; Bond; not as polished and more physical. He's believable as the type of guy that could punch the living daylights out of another agent, whereas Pierce Brosnan looked like he might chip a nail. Quantum of Solace is an interesting film that raises issues about power and energy and natural resources, plus the new Bond doesn't sleep with as many women and doesn't even get involved with the main character (woman) -- she's portrayed as more of a strong co-fighter of crime than a brainless bimbo. Strong action film; I plan to collect all the Daniel Craig Bond films.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Great movie,  I will gladly recommend this movie to any and all my friends interested in a classic Steve McQueen movie
B003U0AHBO|4.0|This is a solid action movie with an interesting twist on the Robin Hood story. In this tale, Robin Hood is a commoner who returns posing as a knight and then picks up the knight's lifestyle. It's enjoyable to watch, especially if you are a Russell Crowe fan (which I am).
B00003CX96|5.0|Dennis Quaid is here!  Didn't know how ripped he was his ENTIRE life.  The movie is such a classic.  Bad in all the right ways and great in even better ways.
B001EAWMGA|3.0|Although I am a huge fan of Jim Caviezel (loved him in Count of Monte Cristo and Passion of the Christ), this movie is just OK. The sci fi monster is a bit unbelievable with it's sparks/lights and the plot sort of plods along in parts so maybe the script is more to blame than the actors. The concept is good & pretty interesting that a futuristic guy with superior fighting skills lands on a more backwards planet & helps them face a fierce monster. Wasn't horrible to watch/decent movie, but not sure I'll watch it again (in other words, I probably wouldn't have bought it, more like something I would rent). We watch a lot of action, sci fi & fantasy movies, and this just isn't in the same class as Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, Count of Monte Cristo, Gladiator, etc., etc.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A great marvel movie. Great casting,  Great entertainment and Great Action!  Can't wait for Avengers 2. Also liked Iron Man and Thor.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|GI Joe is a fun action movie I like to watch over & over so glad I bought it. Channing Tatum is very believable as a solider (though his sidekick is not; more of a doofus and not believable as a special ops/superior fighter pilot). Enjoyed the fast-paced action sequences, excitement, love interest/romance with a twist, the gray of some characters not being all black or white (not just good & evil), etc., etc. I grew up watching &#34;GI Joe...American hero&#34; (can still sing the cartoon song) so really enjoyed seeing this in the theater, and it does not disappoint on DVD either. I've already watched it twice. Also, really love the back stories that give the characters depth and demonstrate their childhoods/motivations/past; gives this movie more than the typical action flick with two-dimensional characters.
034580404X|5.0|I was absolutely amazed that there could be that much sex in 3 books. I am wonderiing how they will do a movie with sex almost the entire film. I also believe that Chris Hemsworth is absolutely the best person to play Christian. He has everything they described in the book.
B003YL4KS0|2.0|didnt get much from this book. just a bunch of hype. a waste of money. facts it did have, you could have gotten on internet.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love the facebook app. it is wonderful. It has come in handy for when I watch tv and check it .
B0053O89IS|4.0|Bones #7 is typical of the series. You are so used to watching Bones, you forget how entertaining it is!
B001P5M7QE|5.0|This Movie is hilarious!  I've seen it years ago and I needed a good laugh so I decided to watch it on Amazon instant que.  I had no problems with the picture or sound.  It was a nice way to end a very full day.
B003NVN1C2|5.0|Overall as a fan of post-apocalyptic movies this one was really good. The acting in the movie was first rate as the emotion on screen translated to the viewer in a tangible way. There was never a moment in the movie when you were not emotionally invested in the plight of the two main characters. This movie really made you have to examine yourself and ask yourself a question &#34;to what lengths are you willing to do what is best for your child, to protect them and keep them from harm?&#34; Charlese Theron acted well in her limited role in this movie and added to the emotional component that helped form the characters. Viggo Mortenson really took this role seriously as witnessed in the physical transformation he accepted as a part of this role. The child actor in this movie was also very good. His lines really embraced the innocence of a child and made you want to jump through the screen to protect him from the harsh, cold and violent afterscape that this movie portrayed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love Colleen's writing style and her other books so I was ecstatic about this one.  First off, you need to know this is not a YA book.  There is heavy material in here.  There is some swearing, sexual scenes, and abuse.  Knowing that, I still wasn't prepared for how this book affected me.  I've never read a book that could melt my heart and break it all at the same time.  Sky and Holder were amazing and very real.  They've been dealt things in their life that no one should have to deal with, but they find in each other trust and comfort that is missing from their other relationships.  Holder helps Sky with shocking and horrifying things that she soon realizes about her life.  I loved this book, but I had to distance myself from it at times because it made me so sad.  It's sad because what happens to Sky happens to people every day and it breaks my heart.  However, even though it was difficult to read in parts, I would highly recommend this book.  It is written so tastefully and you can really feel the emotions from the characters.  This became an instant favorite for me and I would gladly it more than 5 stars!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This would probably be a very good movie if I wasn't so familiar with the original. Maybe it's just me, but the first Total Recall was so original that I would call it a classic. Part of that was due to plot twists which are tough in a remake, because they're already known.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It's a bit buggy but it's getting there I think. Just a fun town building type of stress relief. I like it
B005LAJ1H2|4.0|B day gift for my hubby.  He loves this program.  Started watching the series when we had special cable channels but had to eliminate them.  So wanted to catch him up on what was happening
B007SGM084|5.0|I read the entire trilogy in  less than two weeks. I was tired every morining but couldnot put my tablet down at night. Easy read story line was great.  Heck I want me a Christian Grey... the entire package. LOLOL
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|This has become one of my favorite concert DVD's of all time.  Quality was outstanding, song choice just right and staging, sets and lighting were all fabulous.  I live in the Colorado Rockies and this will be a nice way to spend a snowy, cold winter night over and over again.
0061650994|3.0|This is an entertaining version of the story with great illustrations, but I did not realize there would be a minimum of text.  However, the thrust of the story is there.  Is a good book for children.
1401937519|5.0|this book is one of the two most important books i have on my bookshelf. my other most important book is the original book by max gerson (a cancer therapy: the cure of advanced cancer by diet therapy).<br />i need to read anita's book over and over again to help what she says to sink in to my soul (i forget to practice what she preaches pretty easily). i've bought other books that are trying to send the same message but all of them pale in comparison to hers. i think it's because of her excellent communication style. she explains everything so that it all makes clear sense and is logical.<br />anyways, i recommend this book to everybody i meet now. it was a gift to my body and soul - (as is max gerson's original book).
B007SGM084|5.0|The best Romantic book I ever read. Ill be waiting for the film to come out. Ill be the 1st in line! ;)
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I am certainly a fan of how Amazon makes things easy for the user. I have used Amazon store more than Google because of that.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I like this game alot it's fun and I spend time playing it and not watching tv<br />The only thing is I don't like the part where you have to pinch the screen to see
B006TJXZ30|1.0|It does not work. I can't seem to be able to sync properly. I have to shut it down all the time. uninstallation is the solution
1426209584|5.0|I love this book!  The images are extraordinary, but what I loved as well are the treatments of the history of discovery, the habitat, and the avian biology. This book makes me burst into sentence fragments:  My, to see a passage between islets that Wallace took!  To see species discovered by Mayr!  To see the authors in their camps and in their photo blinds!  To glimpse field notebooks of first-realized behaviors!  And darned near coolest of all, to have and to be able to study lovely maps of the species' distribution!  The text is spare but essential to the book.  The whole package is a voyage of discovery.  Give this book to your family and to everyone you know.  I received a book such as this as a child, with text then much beyond my ability to understand--but I grew into it, and that book inspired me for a lifetime.  So--inspire your loved ones.  And, by the way--support field biology expeditions!  There is much yet to learn about our world.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|This game is addictive. It is so easy to learn and it grows on you. It is interesting how a free game can go so far in levels w/o asking to pay X to buy the premium version. Really good for short periods of time when you do want to get into strategy games and such. Recommended for everyone
0812993357|5.0|It has been a very long time since I have been completely engaged with a book after just a few pages. I started reading, intending to finish just one chapter, put the book down and come back the next day to read the next and so on. However, I just couldn't put this down and burned through it. Delightfully illustrated throughout by the author, her writing style is casual, almost breezy with enough detail to be interesting, but not overpowering. Keep your smartphone or tablet handy, because you will want image research of some of her references. I had suspected this would be a somewhat grandiose biography of someone likely full of self importance, but nothing can be further from the truth. A wonderful fashion journey from the 60's through present day from an eye witness in the eye of the storm. I can't wait to see \\"September Issue\\" as a post script to this book.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|It is what we have come to like in Marron 5. I do not give it a 5 only because they did not surprise me. I guess this is hard to do now after many years...
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Andy Weir does a great job of spelling out exactly how tough it could be for the next generation of astronauts. The hero of this novel, Mark Watney, gets stuck on the surface of the Red Planet when disaster strikes his expedition. The others bail out. He's knocked out and his suit punctured but somehow survives. The book chronicles his attempt to survive. It's almost as if it was written by an engineer because of the attention to detail. But this engineer can write.
B005R32L66|5.0|We have been using it in our Samsung Tab 2 and works nicely over wireless. No hick ups. I would recommend to everyone

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Left you unable to put the book down, a wonderful story about life, love and family and hope that there are actually good people out there!
B009KHCRVO|4.0|Somehow this movie managed to deliver the farcical without slipping into the painfully stupid. Perhaps it was the novel combination of traditional WW2 role caricatures, steampunk  technology visualization, and a variety of cultural, political, and sci-fi allusions?<br />The special effects were variable in quality, but surprisingly good overall.<br />Whether this one hits your funny bone is sure to be a matter of chance, but if \\"(modestly) intelligent farce\\" is a label that makes sense to you, \\"Iron Sky\\" could be for you!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is an amazing series and season four was no exception. Definitely worth the time and money. You wont be dissapointed.
0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart is an ideal read to discover the voice of African tribes whose worldview was irreparably altered by  internal change and subjugation to English and English culture in the early 1900s.<br /><br />Okonkwo, an Igo tribal leader in Nigeria, is an angry, at times rage filled man whose desire is to become great in his village and overcome the shame caused by his lazy, mediocre father.  Each chapter gives insight into tribal cultural life through the religion, folkways, and ethic of the collection of tribes represented. Achebe  masterfully chronicles the cultural clashes and misunderstandings between the British and the Igo people, and writes of a life that was giving way to the westernization of missionary work and industrialization.  The book shows strengths and weaknesses in both cultures, yet leaves one appreciating what the Igo people had to offer.<br /><br />Okonkwo's  pain-filled existence and tragic conclusion is caused by both his choler and a way of life that cannot be sustained.  The loss of personal meaning that came through social cohesion, tribal values, tradition and acceptance of hierarchy is seen through  communal and personal misfortune.  As well, ideas about what is \\"primitive\\" and \\"advanced\\" are reconsidered as Achebe artfully narrates a tribal strength and wisdom that could not sustain itself in the face of western advance and modification.  Meaningful is the way Achebe concludes the book anticlimactically, yet in a way that shows the advance of the West to the detriment of much of what African tribes had to offer.<br /><br />I look forward to reading Chinua Achebe's other works that continue the saga of Africa in the modern age.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So glad I finally read this book after hearing so much about it. I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie with a friend. Once I started it, it was really hard to put down. Now I am looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|Was so nice to revisit this wonderful movie with my little boy. He saw it for the 1st time! Glad we got it again!
B007V65R54|4.0|My background is in mathematics with only a smattering of statistics courses, but my children recommended this to me and I was not disappointed.  This volume tells a story from beginning to the present with entertaining real-world, meaningful examples (including the author's analysis of his stint as a professional poker player).<br />Those interested in the use and misuse of statistics as well as people who question TV commentators' political or sports predictions, will enjoy the thoughtful and powerful reasoning and explanations.
B000148KK2|5.0|I love the music of singer/songwriters and I love this album.  I get a greater impression of how Diana feels than in any of her other releases.  The music communicates to me in the way I like.  It is not for everyone and may not be to the taste of many of her fans, but the only Krall album I will keep.
B00AC8ZJ6K|1.0|You have to be a player to understand this at all. But for someone who was interested in the concept and whether or not I might play, all I can say is...HUH? Starts and ends somewhere, with something going on, but neither of us could figure any of that out, or what it had to do with anything we just saw, etc. Left me clueless. Not interested in the movie or the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is s0 awesome!!! I luv luv luv this game!! it is so addicting!!!! I will never quit playing!!!!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|***update***<br /><br />I am reducing my review to four stars because with further use we have noticed a problem !!!<br /><br />The hand strap is putting dark marks on our screen protector.The marks ( lines ) wont come off so I have to replace our screen protector. Im not sure if it would be an issue if you don't use a screen protector.<br /><br />My brother just added a Kindle Fire HD to our family.He travels by train to work and wanted a protective and professional looking case for the Kindle Fire HD.This case looks great.The leather is soft and looks rich.The case is a bit bulky but considering the protection that it provides the trade off is fine.If your looking for slim and sleek this is not the case for you.We like the hand strap and the rotating features are nice.We L O V E the instant on feature !!! You simply open the case and your Kindle is on! Close the case its  off ! Provides a small thrill every time.I have used it horizontally in bed to watch a movie very comfortably.Overall I think this case is very well built and a good choice for a person looking for a protective case. We just got it but it seems well built and looks like it will last.<br /><br />My only minor quibble???? We would have liked a small flap inside to place a card,papers or a stylus. We got to try this case at no cost but I viewed the selling price and I think its worth about $40.00.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously.  It was the best story I've read in recent history.  Didn't want the book to end.
B000XR4OC0|3.0|I purchased these TOMS as my first pair back in 2011. To tell you the truth, they are pretty overpriced for the quality. The sole of the shoe gets worn down easily, the canvas fabric rips over a short period of time, and the inside smells if you don't wear socks. If you do purchase them though make sure NEVER to wear them in the rain. As for the sizing they do stretch a little. I have other pairs (glitters and desert wedge), but probably would not purchase the canvas slip-ons again.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|if you are a SYFY fan you will love this. full of actions and fun, good story and a lot of laughs
B001DWNUCO|1.0|What a waste of time and money . . . Instead of releasing it on DVD they should have buried it!! There is NO story line . . . a bunch of people running around in colored scarves substituting for costumes . . . (That must have saved on the movie's budget) I've seen better pornography that I'm sure had a budget a lot less than this . . . no wonder the people involved never wanted it referred to in their credits. I remember when it first came out but don't remember Gore Vidal denigrating it on late noc TV. You could tell it was shot on a sound stage by the echoes that could be heard on the sound track. I couldn't even finish watching it . . . should demand my money back . . . Amazon should be ashamed even listing it for sale!!!!
B0079J27JW|5.0|Amazing!  Oistrakh, Rostropovich, Richter:  Three of the greatest virtuoso legends of all time... and together to perform Beethoven under Karajan's baton with the BPO. Oistrakh's performance of the Brahms Violin Concerto with Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra of the 1960's is also incredible.  Oistrakh, a Russian master, was passionate about the Brahms and achieved many triumphs with the piece during his lifetime, some of them in the U.S.  This particular performance is indeed a triumph.  The Brahms Double Concerto....Oistrakh and Rostropovich....what else can you say?  Possibly the best violinist and the best cellist ever to come out of Russia and arguably anywhere else. This EMI Signature Collection CD is a walk through music history in elite company, as well as a wonderful listening experience.  The CD, itself, remastered from the original master tapes, is also technically superb.
B0074V3712|4.0|I saw E.O Wilson on Charlie Rose and got caught up in this brilliant inquiry into how humans evolved social organisation, the expression in art and music.

8866130915|1.0|I normally LOVE this product as I am very picky about my planner, wanting both a monthly calendar and weekly pages.  I have used this planner for 2+ years now and ordered again from Amazon, only to have the small/pocket version sent to me and not able to find the med/large size on the site.  I had to go to B&Noble for it (and paid more) and then was disappointed to see that the monthly calendar layout at the front of the planner had changed and was no longer the traditional American calendar layout but a monthly list, European style.  Had I not discovered this by opening the product, I would have returned it but now no longer can.  I'm disappointed with both Moleskine for changing it and Amazon for not sending me the version that I ordered in the first place.
B005HZJ2UW|5.0|I have read this book repeatedly since high school. It was a requirement then but now it is a pleasure.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|tying all the old universal monsters together like this is a great idea. the only complaint I have is that kate beckinsale doesnt get to come back for a sequal...it wouldnt have hurt if they showed her in a sex scene with van Helsing like in underworld series. the movie was in excellent condition and arrived ahead of schedule.
B009MO5960|4.0|It's a little overrated to say that this movie is the best from Resident Evil series. It is not, and acting was not bad, but I found it to be a little weak and not convincing. It was also disappointing to see shaking weapons in Alice's hands. The story was okay and I look forward for the next movie. I hope directors will do it differently this time. I can feel that the next movie has an actual potential to be not just better, but maybe even to be the best from the series.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|It is really hard to find which character I like the best, they are all wonderful. Dyson makes me want to be a werewolf haha, He is really cool. on the other hand Lauren makes me wish I was a lesbian or she was bi...what a beauty! great acting too, she can be vulnerable, sexy and I bet even dangerous and probably all at the same time. She is even better in season 2.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|This watch is big and it's got some weight to it, but if you wear it all the time like I do after a day or two you get use to it and you can hardly tell you are wearing it
B000YHG72E|4.0|Great movie! I showed it to my high school students the day before winter break; they loved it. Very funny.
B0020M99LC|2.0|The character of Bond is unclear, undecided and for that reason seems poorly acted. I found the first 20 minutes of action without dialogue or real plot development quite boring. The female characters' lives were not explored at all so they seamed to be caricatures.
B000001FFR|5.0|This was the first album of the thrash metal genre that I heard in early 1990.  Before this the most intense bands I have heard included Guns N Roses, Motley Crue, and Skid Row.  I'm glad that this was my introduction to the thrash metal scene as it is a very good album.  This is the first full length album with Joey Belladonna on vocals and Frank Bello on bass.  Joey sings on the higher end in a style similar to Bruce Dickinson and much less rough than the other thrash metal bands coming onto the scene such as Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer.  While I enjoy both this album and Anthrax first \\"Fistful of Metal,\\" they sound almost like two different bands.    This album is the album that defined what Anthrax would sound like for the next 7 years.  If you like \\"Among the Living\\" you'll probably like this album.  The album kicks off with the straight forward metal song \\"A.I.R.\\" and keeps handing out the hard driving songs throughout the album.  The closest to a ballad on here is \\"Armed and Dangerous\\" but even that only is slow in the beginning.  If you like fast and heavy music with high end clean vocals you may like this album.  Fans of old Overkill and Death Angel may find this album appealing.  I consider it to be Anthrax's best next to \\"Fistful of Metal.\\"    [...]
B005ZUR724|1.0|I really do like this game, but not as of late. This is the second update that has effed me out of being able to play on my kindle. I log in then it says I must download new update to continue playing..an update that is not there. Mythical. Invisible. BS! It does not even show my toons on yhe character page. Im just upset at how poorly the android version of this game is taken care of by gameloft. And it is a very popular one too, which makes even less sense! NON-SENSE!! Please....Gameloft....pretend that we are ipad/iphone users or something! No, but for real though...please...PLEASE fix these issues asap. All the kindle users are feening out! Twitching and withdrawing! We need our fix! Please don't give us the cold shoulder any longer!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|the movies is very enjoyable and  fun to watch,not shure if it should been seen by small children it does have a lot of violence and shooting and killing but overall it is well worth the money to but the dvd
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has a lot of information. It is well designed and reliable. The 15<br />day forecast is really helpful.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I thought it was stupid. Great cast, just needed better script. Had some good moments but, not to watch again.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Extreme winter sports. It's funny, you would think that any IMAX film re-transferred to bluray would have the greatest video and audio but that's not always the case especially with older films. I'm happy to say that &#34;The art of Flight&#34; shows off the best that Bluray has to offer when it comes to the 2 most critical elements - video & audio.<br /><br />G. Gordon
1250010489|5.0|I wasn't sure how these computer science spy novels would be.  After reading Mark Russinovich's books, I can't get enough.  They have some technical aspects that they are interesting to consider as a computer scientist, but also enough action to make my heart rate rise.  Very interesting and quite a thriller.  Keep writting Mark!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is my favorite author and this book definitely doesn't disappoint. I enjoyed how the story unfolded gradually...how the pieces of the puzzle didn't really come together until the very end. It really kept me engaged and wanting to continue reading just to get more answers. I appreciated the development of Malcom's character...he was much more shrewd and cunning as the story went on. Having the narrative done from his view was important to the story in my opinion. An excellent piece of fiction!
0316228532|2.0|First of all it would be hard to change genres after the success of Harry Potter. I wasn't sure what to expect after such a successful series of books that were so well-written and clean since they were aimed at a younger audience. Also I did not finish the book, I stopped after part I. Good things - some wonderful phrasing and descriptive passages; really insightful renderings of human nature. JK Rowling is so very talented and the Harry Potter books made so many youngsters into readers. It's always fun as an American to read from the British point of view, I am fascinated by the subtle cultural differences and words for things. Things that made me bail before the book was over, (which is extremely unusual for me) - all the way through part 1 I had hardly met a character who wasn't manipulative, selfish, predatory, promiscuous or abusive, to include the children. Although these characteristics are typical of the human race, you don't read a book to roll around in it, it just got to be overwhelming. There needs to be at least one character who is likable and decent enough so that the reader doesn't feel creepy stepping into their persona. Maybe the person who passed away filled this role and I didn't stick around for it, but after the last scene in part 1 I didn't have the stomach to continue. Also I agree with some of the other reviews that the characters were hard to keep straight, I had to review a couple times to figure out who was married or related to who. There were a lot of people introduced very quickly.
B0040GR01M|5.0|Three Days Grace is one of my favorite bands.  I can relate to the lyrics which makes the it my go to album when I want to zone out of my work environment and just plug away at my computer.  My favorite song is Never Too Late.  It just reminds me that in tough situations tomorrow will be a better day.  I also love Animal I Have Become, it reflects how we all change, not always for the better but human nature makes us change.  Pain is another of my faves.  There isn't a song that I dislike, and I can listen to the entire album over and over.
B00AO1W39G|5.0|Killer Joe is a raw, relentless film that is a welcomed return to form for director William Friedkin. Like his gritty earlier dramas (The French Connection, To Live and Die in L.A.), Killer Joe dwells on the seedy underside of human nature ... and like one of his most controversial works (Cruising), it's certainly not shy about upping the ante for sex and violence. But it's also riveting to watch -- anchored my a stellar cast led by Matthew McConaughey in another standout performance. One of the best and bravest films of 2012!
B00AHSF4AQ|3.0|The movie is great, one of the all time great movie, I was concerned about the product. The first time I played this product, the quality was great. After that the video does not match that of HD.

B0053O89YM|5.0|IT was nice and new. I really enjoyed it.  I already have seasons 1-2. This is one of the best shows out there.
B004NDVJA0|5.0|I heard the song Avenue in the end of one of my favorite TV shows Revenge (which I also highly recommend you watch). For the first time in my life I actually went online and searched for the song. I have never done this before but there was something about the song, the melody and the voice that forced me to find it. Once I found it, I was able to listen to more songs by Agnes Obel, and as they say the rest is history. I immediately fell in love with the soft and almost mysterious voice that Agnes possesses, as well as the amazing melodies and construction that goes into each song. The best word to describe this music is addicting. I have not listened to any other musician since I heard Agnes for the first time three days ago. Listen to the samples, but I assure you that every song on this album is unbelievably great. My favorites are Riverside, Avenue, Just So, Beast and Philharmonics. However as I stated before they are all amazing. Another thing I must point out is the length and genuineness of this review. This is the longest and most heart felt review I have written because after hearing the music of Agnes Obel, I feel that it is my responsibility to share her music with the world. I guarantee you will not be disappointing with this music. My only caution is that before you purchase this CD, be prepared to become addicted :) I literally cannot stop listening, and am actually listening to her while writing this haha. Anyway, I highly recommend you purchase this CD and tell as many people as you can about Agnes. I am shocked that she is not more famous, however all that matters is that I have discovered her for myself, and I hope that this review will help more people discover the wonder that is Philharmonics by Agnes Obel. I'm a guy by the way, a few people I have showed her music to have thought this to be \\"girl\\" music, I must say that this statement is completely false. It doesn't matter what gender you are, this is beautiful music plain and simple.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|well captain america is tha *** so that alone is more than enuff reason to buy along with he fact that the movie is great marvel really is doing an exceptional job with all there hero movies and this doesnt disappoint

B0091REZMW|2.0|This app kept freezing on my kindle fire so that I had to reload it to continue play. The find objects were so small that some could not be seen or found, even after using a hint. The app eventually makes you buy diamonds to continue play, so it isn't really free after all.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|I did like this movie, but I have seen Dwayne Johnson in other movies that were much better. This will not be one of those movies that I will watch over and over again.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This is just a movie that did not have to be made , trying to follow on something that is not there. Pretty poorly made the whole plot just not making any sense.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|This is a great find and enables me to copy photos from other peoples scan disk.  Valuable for sharing photos.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This felt like is not at all going with all the rest of Bourne movies and with ending be so open , we all agree this was just very poorly made

0307743659|5.0|I read this book at least once every year or two - I can never seem to get enough of it.  Each read is fresh and exciting, as if reading it for the first time.  The HOTEL, still remains one of the most riveting, interesting, fully-fleshed \\"characters\\" of this book.  I've truly never seen a movie that did this book justice, but the basic story line goes:<br /><br />Jack Torrance who previously was a drunken louse who lost his job and was semi-abusive to his timid, mousy wife and sensitive son, gets the last job he still qualifies for - a winter-over caretaker at a Grand old hotel.  Only the hotel is haunted with very much alive \\"ghosts\\".  As the guests depart and the hotel becomes more and more \\"alive\\", Jack and his family (especially his psychic son whom the hotel \\"feeds\\" off of) must somehow learn how to survive the brutal winter alive.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|If you looking to have little fu,n in fat noon watch lot of things blow up and some gun fights this is it. Not a very deep story but good movie to take mind of.
B003008RWA|5.0|Great movie, gives you a lot to think about.  Only issue I had with the movie is they didn't explore how the other countries with &#34;free&#34; medical care pay for it (i.e. likely with higher tax rates than the US).
B009IA9OLE|4.0|Amusing diversion, yet somehow hauntingly accurate. Great for passing time in the bathroom. See if you can figure out who inspired each of the prosecutors.

I wish Amazon would put on app out for the kindle that is like flash browser that actually works and is supported!

B002C949KE|3.0|Ariely relates a number of unusual experiments and interesting findings, but usually in a cursory manner, so that's it's impossible to know whether obvious confounds were adequately addressed, and if these curiosities have any meaning outside of the laboratory.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I gave this to a friend/co-worker as an early Christmas present and she has played it every day at work.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy this app.  it's pretty fun and helps the time pass at work.  I'm still trying to unlock the next levels.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Very good service on a great product, I always recommend Prime membership and the one-click option.Give this one 5 stars!<br />Mike Read, USMC(Ret)
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was okay, but not the sort of book you just can't put down until you finish. Good short book.
0316123587|3.0|I actually purchased this book for my sister who is a bigger gleek than I am.  I thought she would have enjoyed the photos and such, but having watched Glee from episode 1,  I was expecting and hoping that especially Rachel and Kurt's messages to each other would have been included, even though they were cut from the episodes, so for that reason alone I was disappointed.  Apart from that it is fine.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Ive never been a trekie but I really liked this movie. Definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good adventure.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book, having read so much about it and heard so much about it, but was finally convinced to give it a try.  Well I can say that every time I walked past my kindle I picked it up which I found terribly inconvenient,  as I should have been doing something else.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and the following two,  as have most women who have read it.  Whilst some might think it kinky it appeals on many levels.  The love story we all love, the challenge of making the relationship work, the characters, the flaws in their natures,  I love them all, but Christian and Ana are special.  I've heard people say they couldn't read it, because of the sexual side of the story, but to be honest I think most women who have read it, would have enjoyed it immensely.  I hope the author writes many more.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I got amazing results with jillian Michael's video and I am completely happy with this purchase. I definitely recommend it.
B0000714BP|4.0|This was just as full of humor as I thought it would be but the plot was even better than I expected.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This game is doesn't even seem like it was made by the makers of angry birds....I was really disappointed in this game...
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I really enjoyed Jaycee's courage in writing this book. Her ability to overcome and persevere is amazing. Her courage is great and her future will be bright! Keep up the struggle Jaycee you are special, I hope you and your girls find peace and joy in your futures!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This was a pretty good movie, but I kept waiting for Jason Bourne to be involved.  There are lots of sticky situations for the main character to get out of, and many chases.
0547884591|2.0|This heavy doorstop of a book is beautifully designed and filled with great information.<br /><br />That's the good part.  Unfortunately, if you had a psycho scout leader, this would have been his dream guide book. Sure you can find the smoking points of every cooking oil you ever heard of and  ten pretty unusual coffee brewing methods with fancy yet minimalist gear.  But then Mr. Ferriss goes on to tell you where to hunt squirrels, and the right guns to help turn them from fleeing to feast.  Or how to make wonderful meals of grasshoppers* or beef hearts.<br /><br />*The result looks like a REAL crunchy nutrition bar.<br /><br />Each topic is as beautifully photographed as you would expect a modern cookbook to be which in the case of preparing beef offal is not a good thing.<br /><br />The lists of recommended cooking equipment suggests you may well be reading this in a limo while you wait for your spouse to finish at Bergdorf's.  The pricey gear list is kinda funny as some of the recipes feature tin cans as the cooking vessels.  I skipped the survivalist equipment list, figuring those pages had wandered in from another book.<br /><br />Undeniably informative, but bring gold bars and a strong stomach.  Two stars for the good info. This would be five stars in a non-gross-out edition.<br /><br />See books by Michael Ruhlman instead, including the science-in-the-kitchen classic, [[ASIN:1439172528 The Elements of Cooking: Translating the Chef's Craft for Every Kitchen]] For  a good encyclopedia about cooking, get Mark Bittman's [[ASIN:0471789186 How To Cook Everything: Simple Recipes for Great Food]]
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|...you must be living in a cave!  Another adventure movie that tweaks the adventures into something corny.  Only for the shear enjoyment of a fantasy movie.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|This is Taleb’s answer to the questions raised in his previous books: What do we do in a world where randomness and the unexpected play so large a role? He gives many examples of systems that—instead of being destroyed or damaged by change—benefit from it without having to predict it. It is striking how he explores matters of great importance and wide application, generally overlooked, and develops elegant and entertaining discussions of them.
B0053FANS6|4.0|Well there are some rather corny scenes. But these are just fun movies to kick back and watch every once in awhile.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I had never watched this when it was shown on cable but totally hooked after watching the fist season. Excellent show, does contain some suggestive erotica as well as some scary death scenes so be sensible, this is NOT for kids.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Don't want to give to much info that might spoil the movie. But if you have not seen &#34;Alien&#34; you might want to after watching this.  And if you have seen &#34;Alien&#34;, you might wish you hadn't seen this?  For me it was a rather weak connection.  The woman who comes up with the major questions in the search; well I felt she, as a lot of archeologist, was way off base.  Mainly from the opening scene, then reflecting that on the over all way the movie ends.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I am a huge Mark Wahlberg fan. I am sorry to say that this move is horrible. It goes places it really should not have. It could be funny, but I found it raunchy and trashy instead. What a shame.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it love vit love it love it ccouldnt live without it to much fun... always playing it ha ha
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|It was a decent movie. I wasn't thrilled about the chemistry between the two. I have seen better from both.
0316023744|4.0|I have always been fascinated with any and all things to do with World War II. From the rise of Hitler, to the bombing of Hiroshima, this is perhaps the richest time in the history of the world. Due to the staggering scale of this time period, most books, both fiction and nonfiction, choose to focus on specific events or characters. In this hugely ambitious work, Antony Beevor attempts to provide a narrative overview of the entire war.<br /><br />In the book, Beevor effectively introduces the early onsets of the war for each nation that was involved.  Spanning from the German invasion of Poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 45, Beevor manages to provide a research filled account without ever straying from his strong narrative flow. He finds a convincing balance between broad tellings of significant battles, military strategy, and intimate insights into the main personalities of the war.<br /><br />At nearly 900 pages, this book is no small undertaking. I'll admit, I read bits of the volume between other novels over the course of three months. Despite the length, I felt like Beevor never sacrificed the telling of the story in favor of dry facts, so the book maintained a consistency that easily places it above other historical works. Overall, WWII enthusiasts, history buffs, and any lover of large scale stories is sure to enjoy this book.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Delightful Spielberg classic. Might be a bit scarey for very little ones because the goofy bad guys are pretty menacing. I'm guessing maybe 8+ might be about the right age. Adults will like this one too.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An interesting story of determination and  innocence. Great read. Not action packed but very thought provoking. One of those books you wish wouldn't end!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is worth every single penny you pay for it! If you love Rick Riordan you'll adore this, and if you read the Percy Jackson series then this series will be great as well! It's got a lot of action, adventure, humor, conflict, suspense, and also some romance too. =) A great read for anyone who can read it!
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I'm probably being generous with 3 stars. Only so-so as something worth listening to for the music itself. And Russell Crowe's singing is embarrassing---what a disaster. Not only does it sound horrible and flat, but it lacks emotion or depth, too. Yikes.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|it is fun but it needs more levels to play. l get bored sometimes playing it because there is only a certain amount of levels
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|If you want the ads gone on your kindle while playing this turn off wifi. Great game if you get rid of the ads.
1416955070|2.0|I decided to read City of Bones after seeing the movie preview screened at Breaking Dawn Part II. So yeah, some young adult fiction is a guilty pleasure. This particular book felt a little more guilty than pleasurable, though. I have to say I didn't think the writing was particularly good. Now, I thought Stephanie Meyer improved a bit on the journey from Twilight to Breaking Dawn, so I'm hopeful Cassandra Clare will improve as the trilogy goes on?<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot. There have been plenty reviews that have already done it. I'll just weigh in on the fact that none of the \\"surprises\\" were really surprising, except the brother-sister reveal which was just icky and not that original. Despite all this, I felt compelled to finish the book. While I found myself skimming what were supposed to be some pivotal, action-packed scenes (enough already), I still enjoyed it. Will I bother with the second or third book? I honestly can't say at this point. Maybe if I'm going on vaca or just need something really light to read.<br /><br />I'm hopeful that City of Bones will make a better movie than book--much like I'm thinking of The Host. Didn't love The Host, but the movie preview looks really interesting.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This novel started out with a clever plot line that kept me guessing. Ms. Flynn is very discriptive and oringinal in that sense but the plot seemed to weaken and then fizzle. I doubt I will be reading any more of her work. This is only my opinion.
B0091THRCU|1.0|I found the case was very tight and the stitching broke as I tried to put the phone in for the first time. I could probably have re-stitched it but I felt that a new product that is described as durable should not break the first time I used it. I've sent it back and requested a refund.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is Disney/Pixar's best movie yet. It has a great message for children and adults alike. You'll be captured first by the incredible scenery and music, and then by the heart of a young brave girl trying to find her own way in life where her choices are limited by the culture in which she was born.  We have watched it over and over with our grandchildren ages 6-9 and pick up valuable lessons each time.
0547260695|5.0|My kids loved this book, very very cute one to keep special, so glad I bought this book for them
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awsome but I wish in multiplayer if u get disconnected u die so u can't lose all your items for ever
B001AQO3QA|5.0|New and improved is all that needs to be said about this. I think it's a must see so see it.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|She has been bugging me to see this movie since she saw the ad of tv and now she has.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I wanted to get the CD version of what I already owned on vinyl and this was perfect. The price was great, too.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Several times it has told me to click for an update but when I click it, it never runs the updates.
B00452J5EG|5.0|I have Midnight Boom,which is afantastic album.I had no idea that the kills earlier album would be so good. Mossheart is so cool,cool cool.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love this app because my friend has it but $6.99!!!!? That's crazy!!! But also if you want to pay six dollars one of the best games!!!!!!!!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this book and I love this series. I started reading this series after watching Game of Thrones on HBO.  This series is just a tour de force. The plotting, the characters, the richness of the settings is just breath taking. This book has a few unexpected plot twists which I think some readers found upsetting. To me the unexpectedness made me that much more of an admirer of Mr. Martin as he is not afraid of actually having his &#34;art imitate life&#34; so to speak. In the words of the great Langston Hughston &#34;life ain't no crystal stair&#34;, and Mr. Martin puts his characters through their paces.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like it. it is a very quick and easy way to manage my battery limit when I need it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I simply don't understand some of the poor reviews that this book received. This book focuses on some of the peripheral characters of the first three book. Martin takes his time, fleshing out not only the characters but the landscapes and cultures of these characters. We learn a heck of a lot more about Dorne and its culture, and thus some of the motivation of the Dornish charcaters spoken of briefly in the previous, specifically Prince Oberyn. We learn about the culture and topography Braavos and what it means to be Braavosi, why they are such good swordsmen. We learn more about the Iron Islands, about Asha, and it s culture through the introduction of a new plot line. In short what this book offers is MORE, more characters, more information about the cultures about the world that the book inhabits. Some say that this book is similar to Lord of the Rings in terms of sheer detailed world building. I would say that this book far surpasses Lord of the Rings in that category.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Regarding Pac-Man-Lite, I did not receive this item even tho I downloaded it.  Showed as having downloaded on my account page but never showed up on devise. Cannot make a written review.
B007WFQZF0|5.0|ALBUM OF THE YEAR (2012) - LIARS' \\"WIXIW\\" - (MUTE)<br /><br />Call it Liars' 'Gone Electric Album' minus the motorcycle accident. From the music releases I've heard this year, in the borderless world of boarded-up bodies, LIARS' 'WIXIW' is the album that stayed with me like a life-vest. Under-reviewed and undersold by most of the music press this year, \\"Wish You\\" is an album worth rejoicing for. It refuses the easy pop-single and jingle dandruff, even though 'No. #1 Against the Rush' and the 'Exact Color of Doubt' might suggest the opposite. It twists with its own sense of Los Angeles belonging. Recorded under Highway 101--from a road that entrances and disenchants its night-riders with ease--came the sound of this brand new world. Seemingly modest in contrast to Liars' masterpiece of 2006 ('Drum's Not Dead') and their other, more abrasive albums, 'Wish You' grows over you like a wet cloak of its own dark making; it rises in shadows while hiding its wearer's countenance; it's all atmosphere, all the time. The woozy, slurred synths, bird calls, echo loops. For a band known for its no wave guitars, vulcan drumming and pagan chanting, Liars retransmits Gary Numan and Aphex Twin with their own left-hand designs. They drop the noise of their Art Punk past and go wildly into the night streaking Daft Punk, transmuting alabaster surfaces into echo chambers. 'Wish You' is a warm, brave and spectral beauty, showcasing--in the most singular fashion--Angus Andrew's most fragile of falsettos. As their first electronic album, it's 'Kid A'--but with all of the warmth and grandeur of 'In Rainbows.' And of all the albums I heard this year, this one came calling back to me like someone I had lost once but still loved. It dialed back to my phone, my car, my computer, and even into the dreams of the unseen. [100/100]
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this! It's really fun and I get to play with my favourite ponies! If you like MLP, you gotta try it!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|The character leverages the addictive behavior of the novel character.  It's different than the BBC Sherlock, and I like both.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|One of his best in years!  A definate buy for all of Van's fans.  I think this is one of the best cd's he has put out in sometime.  Very easy on the ears and worth the money.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I started playing all the Story games a very long time ago. Very limited merchandise or menus or whatever.<br />I stuck with them. I even spent alot of money on the games because I enjoyed them and they do come out with some very nice stuff.<br /><br />My problems are as follows:  The dang popups. Honestly, I cannot handle all the popups, they are endless. I counted 6.<br />You cannot move or do anything unless you acknowledge the popups. If you think it's not annoying try logging in every couple of hours to check your food.<br /><br />It is a free game and I played for the first year without spending a dime. Now everything is paid for. Used to be 25 gems to buy an expansion slot, now it's 49. Yes I know game developers and those that bring us entertainment need to be paid. I have to paid too. But really? 99.00 for some gems so I can look good? I'll go back to skyrim.<br /><br />Love the games but I think they may have gotten too greedy? Not sure. but I won't be back.
B004BCNVOA|5.0|I love Pink's music.  The more I listen to her the better she seems to get.  This is a good collection of songs and a must have if you don't want to buy all the cd's.
B008602KQI|5.0|A great movie following after a great book. Looking forward to the next installment. Even worth repeat viewing. Great charaters played by the right actors.
B005N95JA4|5.0|It only gets better with age.  The bonus songs are a nice addition but the original content only gets better with age....like me I hope!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a well written, well acted, well directed series. Great characters that come to life by the right actors.
0345803507|1.0|Truthfully, I expected this book to really understand the inner workings of BDSM and the lifestyle behind it.  I found instead that the author made it seem to be wrong and inappropriate as usual.  There is enough judgment in society that concurs with this.  I also found it rather repetitive and the characters somewhat ridiculously dwelling on issues that shouldn't matter further. It was somewhat insipid.  I would much rather read ANYTHING by Cherise Sinclair!
B0034G4P4O|4.0|You can see Indiana Jones in this adventure. Non-stop action and really fun. Great for the whole family to see.
0930289234|5.0|Such an awesome story. Came in better condition than expected! This is of my favorite graphic novels/books in general now
B005BCE7II|5.0|This movie is really funny. The whole family was laughing. Bucky was my favorite character, the dude is really gung ho, and not to smart, so he is a really fun character to watch.<br /><br /> 3D was ok, really expected more pop outs. Depth was really nice. No ghosting at all on this so that is always a plus.<br /><br />Overall you need to see this one the kids will love it, and if the price is right pick up the 3D, there is a few things that make it worth it, but its not a must have 3D movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Very easy to read and highly visual. I felt like I was in the arena with Katniss.  Well done.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Viewed it as streaming HD video on my Kindle HD tablet; currently free for Prime Members. Great veteran cast that had good chemistry in this fast-paced comedy/partial romantic comedy. Would have liked to see Harrison Ford's grumpy character re-develop earlier than so close to the end of the movie. Overall, really enjoyed this movie!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Still one of the best free games around. Plays great on kindle fire hd awesome grapics and smooth gameplay. Still challenging seasons keeps it fresh
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Great movie, a classic. I'm pleased with the condition, a little skippy but just great around the tree rape scene.
B005HSL626|1.0|Did not play well with kindle fire hd quit working alltogether deleted it redownloaded still didnt work not sure why. Needs fixed
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I'm not one for musicals or glee but this was actually pretty hilarious so it was a good mixture of everything. My coworker suggested it and when she said \\" fat amy\\" was in it I jumped on it. Overall good movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I choose the rating 5 because this book made me cry my eyes out ! The simple straightforward language makes it truly believable that this is a narration by a teenager. The big takeaway from this book for me was to remind myself of carefree childhood days and to look at things using my own lenses rather than through the filter of years of experience which age inevitably piles on us! A very easy read too .. finished it in about 4 hours. Its fast pace never lets you keep the book down.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Jeremy Renner is today's Charles Bronson.  Ruggedly handsome good looks and plays action heroes convincingly.  Movie plot was great and great transition to the Bourne series.  Especially enjoyed the motorcycle chase through Manila, Wow!!!  He and Rachel Weis were absolutely fantastic in this movie.  Can't wait to see the next movie in this series.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Close your eyes and enjoy! We love the Piano Guys! If you open your eyes and watch the face of the cello player, you will see how much he enjoys what he is doing! I sent this cd to my granddaughter to encourage her to continue playing the piano and she loved it!
B001HN694K|5.0|Great movie.  I like Johnny Depp and loved the special effects in this movie.  Kept to the old story plot .
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this for my grandchildren. They have never played the game as the directions say, but they have used it for hours and hours to create designs and play games of their own creation. Love it!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Grrrrrrrrrrrr.  Eye candy and a good actor too.  What's not to like.  Great movie and have enjoyed this whole trilogy but this was the greatest to end it too.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I haave not heard about this movie yet but assume it will be very well liked and frequently watched by my grandaughter when she opens it up on Christmas day.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This works well for making quick notes. And it can be useful for longer messages as well. I especially like how you can change the colors of the notes, as if you were using real sticky pads. It is very easy to find and reference past notes.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Great movie and follows the bok well.  the color and quality are greast.  I is one those movies that is fun to watch several times because each time you get something more out of it.
B005LAIHE0|4.0|In some ways this is like your typical comedy, with those jokes and scenes that will be funny to reference with anyone else that has seen the movie(but will be impossible to explain to those that haven't...though you will try). But there is also that true to life aspect of it, in which things don't always go perfectly in life, and people will be able to relate. It also gets a little dark for awhile. I will admit that when I first saw it I was a little worried that i might not turn back up. Then it would have fallen into that category of movies that seems to want to rub your face in the fact that life sucks. I would say it is not bad to acknowledge that life is not always perfect, but being that people go to the movies to escape reality to a degree, it is not a good message<br />But this is a good movie for couples to watch, and Segal is hilarious in it. It is funny enough to watch more than once. And considering that it does not have a cast full of comedic superstars, I would say it does quite well.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|What a great movie.  I can understand why it is on so many people's &#34;Best 10&#34; list.  A phenomenal cast who play it sweet and low.  They let the kids shine, yet make the movie as wonderful as it is.  Bravo!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Like all books worth reading, it takes a few pages for this one to really snag you. But after that you will find yourself thinking about the book even when not reading it. I finished this book in only a few days, and that is unusual for me.<br />The way it is organized, really gives you a feeling that you are almost observing the case and investigation as it is going on. The author also does a good job of giving a believable voice to the teenagers in the book. Sometimes that type of thing seems really artificial in books, even when other aspects are not. The relationships in the story feel very real, and the characters are easy to get attached to. I liked this book enough that I immediately considered buying the other two works of this author. But I have held off based upon two factors. Mostly, just as I had suspected, this book is widely considered to be his best work. Also, the other two plots did not sound nearly as interesting as this one. Give this book a read, and I don't think you will regret it. Even someone who is not typically interested by this genre will enjoy the book. I have found myself thinking about this book several times since finishing it.
014241722X|3.0|The book is not meant for an adult reader, but it is valuable in pointing out to adolescents and pre-adolescents that  not all lawyers specialize in the same thing.  For example, Theodore's father is a real estate lawyer, whereas his mother is a divorce lawyer.  He also tells his fellow-students what to do in different situations.  It is primarily a teaching tool, and probably very enjoyable as well as instructive to the young reader.
B000SP1SEO|5.0|This movie is so different than everything else out there, it is almost worth watching based up that fact. But the characters are also so well developed, and the story is just plain old fun. I never get tired of Pitt's gypsy accent, and the look into that underground culture. It is also fun to see Stathem before he was such a big action star. He is a little more subdued, and relies on his acting more than muscles. Definitely a must own.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I recently downloaded Fb for my new Kindle Fire and love the display of the pics and the timeline works fine but.. it only displays around 10-12 of the friends activity in the news feed! Other than that works fine, but you cannot display more updates and feeds, a limit that is simply nonsense. I hope this to be fixed soon, please.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|This works very well for organizing and playing movies on tablets; even the fire HD. I use it for digital movies that I have on my laptop. I just drag and drop them, and they are all organized when I open the app and go to movies. MP4s are the only ones that work on the fire, but there are free programs to convert other files if need be.<br />The quality is good when using this app. One of my favorite features is that there are several options to crop and stretch the screen when watching movies. Definitely a must have if you watch movies on a tablet device.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I recently downloaded Twitter for Kindle Fire after experience using it in Android cell phone. It worked perfectly, easy installation and configuration, easy and fast updating of new tweets... its awesome and I fully recommend this app!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I liked this movie because is so true to life and funny.  The actors are splendid as they play their parts so well.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|veramente ottimo prodotto, prezzo buono inferiore al negozio locale , spedizione un po' lenta...30 giorni sono eccessivi dall'Inghilterra all'Italia. Grazie
B001N4Q4MA|1.0|My granddaughter ordered this without my approval. Quite frankly after the free snippet she decided she did not want it. Buying was made too simple. One click is not always best. Need another safety check.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this story just liked I loved Collen Hoover's Slammed & Point of Retreat. I like how I couldn't predict what was going to happen midway through the book. I loved the main characters of Sky and Holder. Their story was both heartbreaking and beautiful. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Butterflying Awesome!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series ever made! Can't wait for new episodes to start. This show will be hard to beat! Awesome! Best!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|No issues. Reasoable price-best buy for the moneyu  Would buy from this seller anytime.  Delivered ahead of promised date.  Great product.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. Great graphics. New uploads. My son enjoys playing and he is five. I recommend this game to anyone.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is my first review of a book that I have purchased from Amazon. I am compelled to write it because it has been a while since I got swept away by a story such as I was with Blood Song. The first few pages had me a bit 'ho-hum, where is this going?' but I was soon dragged into the story and couldn't put it down. I don't know if my ambivalence was due to coming straight from reading a Sylvia Day book to this one (major change of genre LOL) or the writing. I suspect it was coming from another genre back to epic fantasy. Anyway, this is a great book, the characters are beautifully formed, the action is perfectly balanced, the world built in a solid manner. I am a fantasy reader from way back, when I discovered The Belgariad in my school library last century. In my opinion, Anthony Ryan is most definitely of the same calibre as Eddings, Jordan, Sanderson et al. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be following closely for the release of book 2.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. Great graphics. New uploads. My son enjoys playing and he is five. I recommend this game to anyone.
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a great writer.  When he tells the stories of the individual<br />people I enjoy that. Waiting for the next chronicle to come out.
0547884591|1.0|Man, this is one fricken big book.  Too big if you ask me.  And it's not really about cooking.  I tried to find something of value to takeaway from it after spending 4 days reading this monster and to be honest I can't.  And, no I don't Tango either.
B000AP04NI|2.0|As others have noted, in very technical terms, the quality of the remastered HD version is miserable.  But, this is a two disc set, so if you didn't pay through the nose for it, skip that disc and watch the other, normal one---even on a big screen it's pretty good.<br /><br />People dump on the movie, so one can only imagine what the play must have been like as the movie is, by todays standards, astounding.<br /><br />We live in an age where adults long to be children.  You go into a theater to see a pre-war or mid-century movie and for ninety minutes you're among sophisticated adults, having adult affairs, going to adult night clubs, dressing like grown ups.  Then the lights come up, you leave the theater, the zippy music still bouncing about your head and the audience is all in their hoodies and sneakers like kids.  The quality of our entertainment has been dumbed down accordingly.<br /><br />&#34;Oklahoma&#34; was made when people dressed up to go to the Theater;  long before people wore flip flops to the White House or a three star restaurant.  It's a love story complicated by violent jealousy.  It's a musical where every song is hummable, and often, like an opera, moves the plot along.  And, right in the middle, there's a fantasy dance number, a ballet, exploring the dark side of the story.  Musicals for adults, intelligent entertainment for people who didn't consider their brains to be surplus equipment.<br /><br />&#34;Oklahoma&#34; is beautifully filmed, set to a wonderful score and makes for a great couple of hours in front of the TV.  I'm not so thrilled with &#34;South Pacific&#34; but it's interesting to watch them close enough to see the similarities in the songs---how they almost pair off one to one.<br /><br />No, the expensive anniversary two disc collection is not worth the money---the HD is dark and grainy.  Get a respected copy of the original and wait until the studio stops making excuses and delivers an HD version that is as good as the film itself.

B007QA3AH2|4.0|I saw this when it first came out, and recently bought the DVD;  it bears rewatching quite easily.  I never would have thought a Tim Allen movie would have been much good, so I must have read the reviews before going to see it.  I was wrong, it is.<br /><br />Simple plot, the cast of a long cancelled, second rate Sci Fi Tv show, now relegated to SciFi geek conventions, meet outerspace aliens who've received transmissions of the show and mistook it for &#34;historical documents&#34;, in other words, reality.  They actually built the ship, but since it was based on what they saw on the show, they aren't as effective in using it as they could be and a killer alien (who destroyed their planet) is after them, so they want the crew to help them fend off the villain.<br /><br />It could have gone wrong in so many ways, yet it went right at pretty much every turn.  The result is a very engaging and entertaining SciFi adventure as the cast of the TV show step into their former roles but in real life.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|I really like this movie. Acting may not have been the best but it was Ginas first film. I am hoping she does more action films .
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Much better than the movie and quite thought provoking; a wonderful book and a must read for almost all ages
1568490119|5.0|This book literally made me re-think my behavior. Not depressing at all, very up-lifting. This book can teach you how to be more compassionate toward others...
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Where do I start with this one?  Season one was phenomenal, but season two is even better!  Everyone has their memories and you'd think there'd be something to go back to, but there isn't.  And magic in our world isn't the same as in the Enchanted Forest.  But... what do you do when there's nothing left and there's still trouble in both worlds?
0132350882|3.0|When someone at work organised a screening of a video of a Robert Martin speech it wasn't long before people were chuckling and nodding and even putting their hands up when he asked who in the audience had to deal with \\"turgid, viscous architectures\\". It's similarly easy to find oneself nodding when reading his book. For example, here he talks about developing with a dependency on an API that had not been developed yet:<br /><br />\\"Though mists and clouds of ignorance obscured our view beyond the boundary, our work made us aware of what we wanted the boundary interface to be.\\"<br /><br />Thus his solution: create mocks and stubs that capture assumptions about what the dependency will provide, and away you go. As a bonus this decoupling makes it easy to mock the dependency for unit tests.<br /><br />Except in my opinion those assumptions are going to be wrong and move the task of integration testing to the very end of the project because the team developing the dependency has tasks other than exposing the API and the dependant team can \\"progress\\" without it. The situation I am imagining reminds me a bit of a company Martin Fowler described at a ThoughtWorks event I attended. This story he told had taken place prior to the broad adoption of continuous integration software, and in this story he came into a company that had completed a project and was left with \\"only the integration work\\". The only problem was that nobody knew how long this integration work was going to take.<br /><br />Having said that, the approach has its merits - I remember getting quite far with an agreed-upon database schema that was to be populated by a service that integrated with a different system and was still in progress, and it worked out reasonably well for the most part, notwithstanding a few integration bugs where assumptions based on data types and names of columns turned out not to be true. On a related note, I also really like the James Grenning chapter (even though the cover says \\"Robert C Martin\\" there are a lot of guest chapters) in which he presents the idea of approaching a third-party API using \\"learning tests\\", which is where we learn about a third-party library by writing unit tests for it rather than experimenting with it in an adhoc manner. When I was messing around with Facebook programming, TDD was the first thing to go, as I waded through often inaccurate documentation and used trial and error to find out what API calls did, but of course my learning is now only captured in the software I wrote and Facebook are notorious for making changes that break their API, so automated tests would have value. But I think the chapter goes too far when it says that unit tests of the third party API should give us confidence about upgrading. We'll write the unit tests when we first start learning the library, but the way we use it in production code is going to outgrow the functionality we initially tested, so I say unit tests of the API cannot substitute for integration tests that excercise the API the way the production code excercises it. Integration tests aren't given much attention generally; in the chapter after James Grenning's there's a chapter on unit tests that says \\"You should be able to run the<br />tests in the production environment, in the QA environment, and on your laptop while riding home on the train without a network.\\" Doesn't make much sense if you followed the previous chapter's advice and wrote unit tests for third party libraries you depend on, which might be exposed as web services.<br /><br />I am suspicious of anything that is presented with too much confidence as some sort of panacea, and while there is much in this book that is useful a lot of it does seem to be common sense about what is bad practice mixed in with dogma about what is best practice. For instance, Bob does not like something I've been guilty of in the past, which is writing a while loop with an empty body. The problem being that it can confuse you intothinking that code below it is executed inside the while loop, so he'd like you to put the semicolon on its own line like this:<br /><br />while (dis.read(buf, 0, readBufferSize) != -1)<br />;<br /><br />But is that semicolon on its own line really that noticeable or would it be better to do this<br /><br />while (dis.read(buf, 0, readBufferSize) != -1) { }<br /><br />The problem is real, but the solutions are more arbitrary than the writing style makes it seem.<br /><br />And for a book that presents itself as a sort of elements of style for coders, it's odd to see some fairly startling typos. For example, in the chapter on concurrency we are told that \\"Attempts to repeat the systems can be frustratingly.\\" Huh?<br /><br />I realize this may be seen as nitpicking, but nitpicking is the mindset that the topic of the book puts the reader in. In fact, I am being harsher in this review than I meant to. The chapter on good and bad comments (and the idea that we should favour \\"self-documenting\\" code over comments) I found quietly revolutionary in a world where the coding standards of lots of companies and universities regard comments as intrinsically \\"good\\", even when they are the kind of comments that a tool such as ghostdoc could generate automatically.<br /><br />I guess my only objection is to the tone of the book that seems to regard itself as some sort of bible, which is the same way the person who introduced it at work seems to regard it.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|i found wikipedia.com on the net ages ago and use it a lot. it is the 'go to' site for nearly everything you wish to confirm and for tidbits you never knew, so when i heard that it also comes in the kindle fire form, i downloaded that app asap.  i have never known wikipedia to be anything other than accurate for for those rare missing pieces of info wikipedia hasn't got, there's always the broader net as a go-to.  two apps belong on a kindle fire: a dictionary and wikipedia - all others are of personal choice.
B00APUQJLO|4.0|This movie definitely had that Cronenberg strangeness - which is very taste specific. I enjoyed this film and appreciated the eccentricness of it. You had to pay close attention to follow the plot and the cast supporting was in and out so quickly (which was a bit disappointing considering the talent), with the exception of course of the main characters. I was pleased with Robert Pattinsons performance - it was nice to see him in a more adult, less twilighty roll. Sarah Gadon did a great job in my opinion - she was fantastic as being a distant, strange person and I enjoyed the relationship between her character and Robert Pattinson.<br />This movie gives you a very odd ride - which I presume was its intent.
B00AGH6FD8|4.0|Cute and fun. Couple of more adult themes. Two cuss words d*** and one horses a**. All in all a lot of laughs
B003O86FMW|5.0|I never read the first book but after watching the movie I couldn't wait to start reading the second book. It was amazing
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|My two favorite Wayne movies are The Searchers and El Dorado. El Dorado is one of those classic john Wayne movies.Love it. The only issue I have is this movie and Rio bravo are basically the same movie lol. Love them
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A feel-good movie that is not sacharine, but respects aging as a difficult but potentially liberating transition. I would recommend it for all ages!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I never really paid attention when this movie came out and was hesitant to watch it.  Wow was I surprised how great this movie was and I know that I shouldn't be surprised.  All Clint Eastwood movies are great and this one can be added to the list.  I want to see it again.
0316223239|5.0|I love this book.  Jack's view of his limited world is fascinating...he is totally human but totally lacks some knowledge due to knowing only the \\"Room\\" he grew up in shared with one other human being, his mother.  For example he doesn't get that there may be more than one of most items.  Also, his Mom has tried to shield him by saying stuff on TV is all fiction, and only their room is real, but obviously as he grows he can detect more inconsistencies in what she tells him, and she will have to tell him more.  It's beautiful how much we get to know his Mom through Jack's descriptions.  It's heart-wrenching to read Jack's matter of fact descriptions of what turns out to be a tragic and frightening situation.  He is not all that scared because it is all he has known and he has the most important things in a child's world, his Mom's love and presence.  The pathos made me cry a few times in the first half of the book and then a lot in the second half.  When the book ended I was upset that I couldn't stay with Jack and his Mom for more of their journey, and be inspired by their strength and resilience.
B00013M6NK|5.0|The battery is just like the one in my camera, which is several years old, but a good camera I want to continue to use.
0470876417|3.0|I would have given this 5 stars based on content and cleaver design.  But, if I had seen it in a bricks and mortar store, I would have not purchased the book due to its text visibility.  If one is over 40, I think they may have issues like mine.<br /><br />I would recommend waiting until a Kindle edition is available for the over 40 folks.
B0062P3392|5.0|In my opinion this is a good movie, but then with Jason Statham, you can't go wrong, and throw in some Clive Owen and it's a hit!
1455523003|5.0|A very brief book, which is a credit to Hitchens for not padding it out, since he really only needs a handful of key points to demolish the Mother Teresa myth. Most devastating is her plea for clemency for savings and loan swindler Charles Keating and her subsequent failure to respond to the prosecutor's very respectfully written letter requesting MT return the $1.25 million of innocent savers' money Keating handed to her. Even devoted Catholics who agree with Teresa's speech (when receiving the Nobel Peace Prize) that abortion is the greatest threat to world peace must concede the inconvenient truth that Teresa's willingness to take cash from the likes of Keating and Michele Duvalier is not worthy of a &#34;saint&#34;. As ever, Hitchen's writing is superb and frequently very funny. Thoroughly entertaining and enlightening for any reader with an open mind.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My daughter, who is two months shy of her 3rd birthday, whipped through the puzzles. She loves them, and the extra bonus of popping bubbles and balloons, spinning boats is super fun for her. She has mastered all the puzzles very quickly and my only complaint is that there are not enough of them and they don't progressively get more difficult so that she's more challenged.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Serves it's purpose for my basic calculating needs. Seems to have more features that I have not needed to explore
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I have used this app to find files on my kindle which are invisible in the Kindle's menus. Also great for installing other android market apps (.apk files) which you've downloaded and drag-dropped into the kindle from your pc. I also recommend their task manager for killing annoying processes which run in the background. (Unfortunately it seems there is no way to get rid of the Audible app which always runs in the background.)
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is an okay game for a city type game.  It's a little more involved than most and at least gives various ways of earning city certificates other than spending real money for it.
B005IQZB14|4.0|A reflective piece that allows us to see how the authors choices helped her reach a better place. A must read ofr those who are looking ofr a better time and place in their lives.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|They're just that good, I can't say anything else.<br />Pentatonix just rocked this album, it was so beautiful that when I shared it to my friend she cried.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great Movie-I was thoroughly entertained! I think I need to own this one! Animations were Amazing! Great Story Line! Five Stars!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Serves my basic alarm clock needs. I am not a super heavy sleeper, so it wakes my up easily enough and I like that it has multiple &#34;sleeps&#34;
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Great album. Bruno Mars nailled it on all the songs. My favorite tracks are Locked out of Heaven, When I Was Your Man, & Guerilla. It's a must have.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Went to a recent concert of hers and heard many selections from this new album. The album keeps the music alive and fresh in my memory.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|You won't want to put this down. Great story. I don't want to write more because I don't want to give away any spoilers...but you will not be disappointed.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The overload or starts and the subtle comedy makes this a good movie to watch. You get what you would expect from this one.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie for families. Funny, great graphics and just fun! Taylor Swift and Zac Effrontery are awesome and Danny DeVito, awesomeness!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Excellent visuals. Not just for children.this is a must see ; and a must hear. A great fairy tale. Hooray for Disney
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Just like the PC version. Well worth the money!<br /><br />I was looking for a scary slender man game, scanning reviews on every single slendy game on the market. Most of them had 2,3 stars overall, and 50-80 reviews. Not so good. One was even 3 dollars! Slender Man! Chapter 1: Alone was the one that was the highest rating, and not so expensive. Perfect! So I went ahead and got it, prepared to see my good pal slendy once again.<br /><br />And boy, what a scare! I dropped my kindle fire and barked out a full forced scream!<br /><br />Gameplay is fantastic- excellent graphics and easy controls! Notes are fairly easy to find, although if you don't have the guts to sneak around something, it's a fun &quot;I gotta play it again!!&quot; moment. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, which I love.<br /><br />Since this is only the first chapter, I give credit to Digital Code Works for not making this too challenging, since there is obviously more to come!<br /><br />I highly recommend this app for anybody who wants/needs a little scare, or a waker upper! This is perfect for slendy fans, geeks, nerds, electronic device hoarders, ANYBODY! Well worth the money- I can't wait for Chapter 2!
B007C7UZIG|5.0|When I first encountered Steam, I was hesitant.  My experience with retail download services had left me with mixed feelings. I had been confronted with the rip-off practice of download insurance. By that I mean that once you buy a game the link to download it is only active for a certain short period of time, after which it expires. One game in particular I have purchased three times. Every time I need to re-install it I am stuck purchasing it again. It does no good to store it somewhere since I cannot use the activation key to reactivate it. I understand the desire to discourage pirating, but how many people are willing to pay for a game more than once?<br /><br />Steam doesn't pull any such nonsense. I have been able to download games I purchased several years ago. Using a product key, I can activate many of my non-Steam games. There are numerous player driver forums (fora?). In addition, there is an entire section devoted to showcasing indie games in development. There are groups for people who play specific games. Steam hosts most multiplayer games. If your friends are gamers, you can purchase Steam gift certificates at venues like EB games. You can also gift any Steam games you wish via email or directly through Steam. There is solid support through Steam as well.<br />As if that isn't enough, there are also numerous sales. The best of these sales occurs around major holidays when the prices are unbeatable.<br /><br />If you are wondering about Mac: yes! Steam is beginning to offer Mac titles.<br /><br />My one concern is what happens if Steam changes hands or goes out of business? For the longest time I only purchased games at stores where I could buy a hard copy on CD. This has become less an issue as more and more sites offering digital downloads only.<br /><br />If you are a gamer who hasn't tried Steam - what are you waiting for??

B0076DCT2G|5.0|This novel answered all my expectations from a DeMille novel;  a strong male character, witty dialog, a peek into an exotic culture, and plot twists and turns that kept me guessing.  Hope DeMille is half way through his next book.  Donna Nemsick

B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Lots of humor & good story. Animation was very fluid. A great testament to the human spirit and the will to protect others.
B008Y1YJ90|4.0|I'm a little biased since my daughter worked on this film, but it's a fun telling of the Santa Clause lore.  A must add for your Christmas viewing.
1401307787|5.0|I had borrowed a copy of this book from a colleague and had to have one of my own. I read it from cover to cover several times and now use it as a 'dip into' book for inspirations, affirmation and realisation.  Kabat-Zinn writes in a way that appeals to a broad range of readers who can learn from his suggestions which are developed through examples and narrative.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|my hubby has watched this quite a few times. lots of action and adventure. It is a guy movie and they will love it.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Not quite as entertaining as Pride and Prejudice, but well worth reading.  The language alone make an Austen novel worthwhile.  Austen would have been quite at home in the Women's Lib movement.  However, her books are a testimony to the fact that there have always been women who pushed the boundaries of their society.
B009O07NBQ|4.0|Howard Shore once again manages to compose an epic score that perfectly compliments the films that came before. I was worried he'd go the Hans Zimmer route, the way most composers have, but he stayed true to the sound he established for the series a decade ago.<br /><br />I like the new themes and motifs; Shore doesn't completely rely on his old themes. The only real complaint I have, and this doesn't affect the rating, is the harsh recording quality. There's just too much treble. The music is harsh on the ears at times, and there are times when the bass overwhelms the music, distorting it. I miss the '90s, when film music was perfectly mixed. Nowadays, it's just harsh, sharp treble. Oh, well....
B00992CF6W|5.0|I haven't played this on the kindle because it cost $7 but I have played mincraft pocket edition before and its really fun but I wont buy it because of the cost but if the free version comes out I'm buying it

B0007VCZ50|5.0|This is a true classic early rockumentary (or I suppose jazz-rockumentary).  Younger kids of today may think everything was always shot in &#34;reality&#34; style, but it was not.  That said, it is quite amazing how pretentious it is compared to something you'd expect to see today.  Sting came up from a humble background to create a persona that developed into that of a modern day self made Prince or Lord of sorts and self proclaimed Champion of Worthy Causes. So why not have a vanity piece for your new project shot in a French chateau? Thankfully, his musical brilliance made this precious behavior tolerable and this video covers his arguably best solo album (his first), which was a very bold and brave departure from his starring role in the biggest band in the world just before this (The Police). It is fun to watch the powerhouse band develop songs during practice jams and the self importance of the between segment chatter (including  Miles Copeland's frenetic rants, themselves worthy of a Spinal Tap style parody) is all forgiven as soon as Sting hits the stage and belts out fantastic versions of his songs in concert.<br /><br />Any Sting fan must have this! I find the audio and video quality of the DVD to be excellent, and from looking at the reviews here, it doesn't seem like the Bluray version represents much of an improvement, so I am content.  This is Sting at the height of his creativity and in a great period of discovery, something fans will watch again many times over the years.
B00000IZOR|4.0|the item was everything i expect it to be, it is so cute the only thing is that the phone cord is too short. overall i like it
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It's too bad that history has to be defined by war, but the second World War was a defining point in the history of the world. The Nazis had hijacked the government of Germany.  They succeeded by terrorizing those German citizens who saw the Third Reich for the morally corrupt government that it was.  It is a balanced story of the brave, the evil, and those just trying to be survivors.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I don't even know why anyone would have to write a review for this. Game of Thrones is by far one of the best shows out there right now.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|I love every song on this album. If you have enjoyed Maroon 5's recent radio hits--the ones that have played in the past year or so like Payphone, Moves Like Jagger, One More Night, and even Adam Levine's part on Gym Class Heroes' Stereo Hearts--you will love the songs on Overexposed.<br /><br />This is my first Maroon 5 album purchase so I can't compare it to their earlier releases, but if they keep turning out hits like they have recently, I expect I'll be making many more purchases in the future.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Surprising good adult novel by JK Rowling. I think the bad press, is a personal grudge against her, at not giving ' ad nauseum, numerous interviews to promote her book' by the press.<br /><br />Mysterious, sexy, actually very sexy...<br /><br />I felt transported to , this 'small town, in England, with small mind mentality,' I was born in the UK, so these places really do exist. Especially south england.<br /><br />A good novel, to get her out of the legacy of Harry Potter, so the critics out there, 'take the wood out of their eyes', and give it a fair review.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|There are very few contemporary writers whose work I closely follow, but McEwan tops the list of those I do.  I looked forward to every word of this novel; while reading it, I had trouble enjoying anything else that was going on in my life!  I thought the main character, Serena, was amazingly intelligent and insightful, the plot was satisfying on all levels, the language was gorgeous, and I am also quite intrigued by McEwan's statement in an interview that this novel is a disguised autobiography.
1586217194|5.0|I loved this exploration of the human brain and it's capacity to do things without us noticing.  I's the good news and the bad news but it is important to understand.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|I say \\"hmmm\\" because Rush has always been my favorite band, but in all honesty, after \\"Signals\\" their albums have just has not impressed me, although the musicianship is always awesome. But awesome musicianship can also be very dull and boring! Strange but true! I did like Roll the Bones well enough and it was a bit later. It's only my opinion but their later stuff just doesn't do it for me, and I'm going way back in the early 90's when I mean \\"later stuff\\". From their beginning up to Signals, all these albums were great from start to finish. Grace Under Pressure and Power Windows had a lot of good stuff too... But I was so disappointed especially with Counterparts, then another disappointment after another, and so on, I'm sure I don't need to list all their albums..... I thought Vapor Trails really sucked. Again, being my favorite band since I was 16 (I'm now 52) I just ignored the disappointing albums, and appreciated all the live stuff that kept coming... Well Clockwork Angels is just that again for me~ very disappointing. Still great musicialship, but it just doesn't have anything catchy and appealing like their earlier stuff. Heck I even own a Geddy Lee signature bass because I do play, just to give you a true idea of how I love Rush. All the live stuff is always great, and I have everything imaginable on dvd as well. Maybe I just miss their epic songs they used to do? I'm still hoping for something like to XANADU, or something that has the same flavor as Moving Pictures, or the amazing 2112. I always wonder why they never did some of their great songs live, like \\"Losing It\\" from Signals, or The Twilight Zone from 2112, or side two from Caress of Steel! Yeah, I miss the old RUSH from the days I saw them in the 70's and 80's. This is just my opinion, I'm surely not meaning to offend anyone who likes their later stuff. I just can't make myself like this album very much even after several listens. I still gave it as much as 3 stars just because it is after all RUSH.H.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are wonderful if you're waiting somewhere like the doctor's office or you're on your break at work.  With so many games to choose from, you'll never have a hard time finding one you like!
0307887898|5.0|This title has been extensively commented, but I thought I would add a simple statement of my own. As a first time start-up member, this was a game-changing methodology for me. This methodology may literally save your start-up, its that effective.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|2nd season - Everyone needs to buy this PBS series & watch it. Excellent acting; good storylines. Keeps the watcher entertained & wishes there was more.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game but it shew uld have better control if it is going to be a touch and slide game and all because the touch and slideness stinks. but it also rocks too....
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great read funny, entertaining, shocking, makes you want to read more.  Parts of the book will make  you laugh out loud.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome. I can do anything on there and I can build anything I imaging. Its the best game ever it should have 5 stars.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This is probably the best free movie I've watched on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />A legal drama, involving a street-wise lawyer who is ultimately honorable, with many twists and turns (which I won't detail here to avoid spoiling it).  Kind of like Saul from Breaking Bad crossed with Atticus Finch.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Five stars here because CCR's sound is just so great. This is a wonderful collection of some of their best. Great for driving, great for any time. Especially great for the price. Recommended for pretty much anyone who enjoys good classic rock with a bit of classic country sound and rhythm as well.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|this is a great read even after reading the 50 shades trilogy. Can't wait for the rest of the series to hit stores
B00004YA66|5.0|Good price, quick delivery.  I enjoyed the movie since I am a new Ham Radio Operator.  Although it was a fantasy it was an entertaining story.  Thank you.
0340203161|4.0|This novel only covers a time span of about 2 years if you exclude brief flashbacks, but it is otherwise epic in its scope.  There's many classic themes combined in this one giant book (over 1000 pages in 2 volumes).  It starts with the \\"Fish out of water\\" theme, which can be taken almost literally in the case of the main protagonist, an English sailor most at home on the ocean who is stranded in Japan not long after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in the reign of Elizabeth I.  While I can't vouch for the accuracy of the cultural descriptions, they are fascinating nonetheless.  Also, if there's a book written in English that contains more ritual suicides, I'm not aware of it.  It also touches on themes of forbidden love, religious intolerance, racism, loyalty.  I found it to be a page turner and a quick read in spite of its length.
B005HSL626|3.0|My boys like this game and with them there is always that victory dance when they win. Well, the game keeps them busy (heck it's karate isn't it?)and the graphics are nice so you can't lose!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Great series - drama with a touch of humour.  I can't wait to purchase the other seasons!<br />Cast is really great.
1428144552|5.0|I read the book and bought the Audio version for long drives.  It keeps my personality Happy and Energetic thinking of all the blessings waiting out there for me, just because of the way I THINK!<br />:)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book deserves so much more than five stars.  It was love at first page, as crazy as it may sound. I did not read the previews or the synopsis for Hopeless.  I just purchased it simply because I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat. And let me tell you Colleen did not disappoint.  Hopeless should have its own category because there's nothing like it out there.  There were parts where I laughed out loud and parts where I could not stop crying.  It broke my heart in little pieces but by the end of the story it was whole again.  Hopeless doesn't even need a review.  If you've read Collen Hoover's books you should just go ahead and purchase this because you will not regret it.  I'm not going to give you the typical synopsis; I'm just going to tell you that you will enjoy every minute of this read and you will always remember it as a wonderful, entertaining, and moving love story.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Very helpful, some new ideas that can be applied to what I have already learned. Great for beginners to start their journey.
B009YQJ322|4.0|The film takes place in a futuristic society after much has been destroyed with atomic radiation. Law enforcement officers are called Judges as they act as judge, jury and executioner. Society is attempting to regain law and order, but is losing. Drugs compromise the largest aspect of law enforcement. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) whose face we never see, is cold, calculating, and strictly by the book enforcer. He is assigned a rookie (Olivia Thirlby) who is a mutant and has special mind reading powers.<br /><br />When a triple homicide happens at a block high rise, our duo goes to investigate only to uncover a large scale drug operation. The drug is called \\"slo-mo\\" and gives one a slow motion sensation which adds to the special effects as we get to see plenty of slow motion killings.<br /><br />At this point the feature becomes akin to a video game where our two judges must ascend a a locked down high rise clearing out levels in order to reach Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) the leader.<br /><br />There is plenty of action. In fact the film is almost all action. The sound track was fast paced. Along with the heavy action and blood, one could claim this was similar to a Tarantino grindhouse. 5 stars if you don't care for drama or characters.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs, brief sex, brief distant nudity (?), lots and lots of blood and some brain splatter.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The movie's story is about service to others in a world where people are commonly tempted or bullied into passivity.  George Bailey though is unafraid, curious, an activist, and is drawn to see and get involved with everything in the wide world.  It's just that no one can replace his services in Bedford Falls, and he feels his duty is there.  The story builds to the moral that George's investment in his native town pays off well for him as well as for others -- an early illustration of the advice to \\"Think globally, act locally.\\"<br /><br />The story is told in microcosm in the scene where George's mother sends him to Mary Hatch's house.  This is one of several scenes where George's frustration seethes and boils over, but it's here that he knows it's finally done for keeps.  More surely than the angel Clarence Oddbody, Mary Hatch represents salvation in this funny, terrible, iconic moment.  James Stewart and Donna Reed are splendid in it.
0316227706|5.0|I am such a dog person and this product is for everydog person out there. It is funny and so sweet, It surely will make anyone happy! 5 Stars
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey trillogy, you'll like this.  Just remember to read all three in the series.
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|They are modern acapella harmonics to perfection.  Now I will have to look into the rest of their albums for more.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Before reading this book, I had heard it described as \\"mommy porn\\", but it's not too dissimilar to Penthouse Forum. Well written porn.
B008FOB124|5.0|Lisa and Brendan are back! Fantastic DCD CD! I recommend it to anyone who likes their previous CD's or those who like Lisa and Brendan's solo efforts.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|Two things you should know about this film.  The Directors Cut is the way this film was meant to be experienced and clearly defines why a studio should never butcher a film to met film run times for theater showings.<br /><br />Lastly, Edward Norton's uncredited performance as Baldwin the 4th or better known as The Leper King is nothing short of Oscar caliber.  Although you never see his face because he always wears masks due to his condition, his physical presence, mannerisms, and vocial performance are what make this movie special.  Why Norton did not receive more Oscar consideration is a travesty.  A good comparison of Norton's performance of The Leper King is what Heath Ledger did for the Joker in the Dark Knight, both movies achieve more with these character performances.
1250006341|5.0|I love history and having the background to the series is great. Really enjoyed reading it. Of course, the pictures were an added bonus..
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I laughed the entire time. Every episode is funny in the series and on it's own. I'm excited to see how things unfold.
0763644765|5.0|For weeks and weeks, this was my toddler's favorite book. He loves imitating the various facial expressions and claps his hands with excitement. We bought it used for 5$ shipping included
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book, it holds a large portion of story line within it. As the second book of the trilogy, it serves its purpose as the middle book. While not quite as fast paced as the others, it is still full of action and page turning excitement.  I definitely reccommend this whole trilogy. Especially to fans of the hunger games and other stories like it.
B00009YUPY|4.0|This mouse is the same as the one I use at work. I ordered a spare to keep at home so I wouldn't have to pack up my mouse every time I left work. Seller deliver the product on time and as described.
B00992CF6W|3.0|survival craft is made by one man is3.99 and has way more stuff than this the graphics look better and it has electricity and buckets unlike mojang they have a whole team and they cant even get buckets to work. also the world never ends so you can creat forever
0670022705|1.0|If you can stomach chapter after chapter of left-wing ideology smeared over fascinating artifacts, you'll adore this book.  If you are an intelligent, well-read, well-traveled & reasonable person, you'll be doing a lot of eye-rolling -- which will interfere with your reading.  Which may be a blessing...
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I first read this book at 12 (lots of years ago!).  The second time around it is still a great book that keeps you turning the pages.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|It was weird seeing one character that died in the first movie, then the return of two.  Looked more like they were trying to rewrite the first movie in a different aspect.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|I have watched this movie numerous times on UVerse, and wanted to get a copy the I can show to others. The more I watch it, the more I enjoy it. Your product was without any defects, and delivered as expected. Thank you
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works perfectly. How about a scientific? Four function math is nice but<br />Hey, we live in a scientific complex world.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|this game is easy and fun. its like your a lap rat and you get treats for pushing the right buttons at the right time. I am so glad I have spent hours honing my hand eye coordination to become a better rat.
B004MPEVWC|4.0|I don't like rape scenes, but I like to see abused people get their revenge. It's interesting to see what the girl transforms into in order to go through with her actions.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The songs are awesome. I love their version of bruno mars &#34;just the way you are.&#34; It was quite entertaining
B0000931QA|5.0|A milestone of modern music. The muisc, lyrics, and concept of the album are truly Epic! A must have for the library.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The film itself meets the test of time.  It was as good today as it was all those many years ago I saw it in 70mm.  The restoration and Blu-ray were magnificent.
0345525558|3.0|didn't like the jumps in time, was confusing. The education about flowers was great. Didn't have too<br />much patience with Victoria, too depressive without legitimate reasons, it could all have her fault.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|Love the performance, love the content. Streep was remarkable in this role. She is such a treasure. The direction and script were solid, but without Streep it may not have held together.
0307744434|1.0|I am not sure why or how I finsihed this book, except that I wanted to see what a young book club was reading. It was much too long for such a story--perhaps a short story would  have been enough. I could see no point to it and nothing to discuss that would be meaningful as it was not based on anything real--but everyone has his own taste.the last part just dragged on and on-one could have talked about how much it needed some more editing.<br />Perhaps it is because I have just finished reading several books by Julian Barnes, a wonderful writer.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Reads like LeCarre, very well done and reads like a leCarre novel. Excellent use of description, and plot. Storyline keeps you guessing.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|The movie is fun, but watch the specials. The special on Jonathon Larson is heart-breaking. Five more words are required.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|My son loves opening a door everyday.  The builds are straight forward.  My only complaint would be that there are a lot of space ship builds that all look very similar.  My son, who is six, says they are not the same.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Found the whole premise of the movie really disturbing. Children being sacrificed for the amusement of the elite was not something that made any sense to me. I don't see how this qualifies as a great movie.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|i have download this for hear music, and it works perfect in my pandigital nova tablet. i love it.  i recomend it./
B005LAII94|5.0|its an excellent example of mr stones work ! good for adults not kids benicio del toro always worth the price and selma hayek channeling griselda blanca! nothing but violent but well done violence!
0547884591|5.0|...if you want to commit the time and energy to do it.  It overwhelmed me, and I am not doing at this time. Maybe another future time.  I still have to rate it a 5 star for what it is, and that is an excellent program....just not for me now.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Bought this for my 7 year old niece.  She has been watching it over and over again. Very gentle and sweet story.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|it's terrible!!  You can only view like ten status updates at a time .  Please fix this problem or I am going to delete the appapp :(
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Long, predictable, tedious .Did I say long and one big yawn.<br /><br />This movie could have wrapped in an hour and the story would still have been the same.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this application on my kindel fire, it's convenient more than my cell phone. just it for Christmas present.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Fast-paced action movie, no non-sense. Good script and acting. IMO, the only flaw is the last section of car-chasing scene, it's too long.
B002MW50KO|3.0|The one star reviews of this are hilarious.<br />Karaoke at a nursing home just about sums it up.<br />Or Little Town of Bethlephlegm.<br />It is definitely a great gag album.<br />What next? Dylan Sings Liberace?
0446554995|5.0|Preston and Child did it again. Another great read.  Good mystery and good plot line.  Love this series.  When is the next book?
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|It was as good as I remember in the movies. I loaned to my son so he could reviw it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|One of the easist shapeners to use.  This product is keeping my knives in perfect condition and is small enough to carry in any pocket.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just finished Hopeless and I loved it just as much as Slammed and Point of Retreat!  I love the turns Colleen takes with her writing.  Thank you for writing this amazing story!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great story . One that lives in those who serve in our service personal today. Thank you all for your service and being our captain america. Now america get off your butt and make a difference today.
B001AITGWE|5.0|This movie is Excellent. It involves issues that are timeless. Highly recommend. This movie. Is really for adults and should not be shown to children.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|if it didn't consistently freeze and / or crash during game play.  I have also had several instances where I open the app only to find my progress was not saved and I'm several levels, quests, and achievements behind where I left off.  It is a difficult proposition to get me to spend time, much less pay to play,<br /> when all the units you have built, coins collected and missions won are gone from time to time.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I have watched the movie twice and passed it on to be enjoyed by others. The movie was delived as promised.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|My husband introduced me to your vampire books. I loved them all and finished them in 3 weeks. So when this book came out I was so happy to read another book of yours. I am a mom to 2 wonderful kids and stepmom to 3. With my life being so crazy with 5 kids and working fulltime. I need some \\"me\\" time to relax and your books provide that for me.<br />This was a fun fast pace book. I was hooked within the first chapter of this book. I even was reading it at work in between phone calls. I am hooked and can't wait for the next book. I even have tried to come up with ideas on how to help get him out of the dungeon. I am desperately waiting for your next book and will pre-order it as soon as it's available.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|One of my fav shows. Bluray looks amazing and the dragon egg is cool :) Can't wait for season 2 to be released!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Play this daily.  It's fun and addictive.  Great way to keep the mind occupied during lull times of the day.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|it is the most funny movie ever. I laughed like crazy when I saw it. all the booby traps where really a sucsses
B00009Y3L4|5.0|Great purchase! Bob Fosse's film version of the Kander and Ebb stage show is stunning in every way! Liza Minnelli leads a sterling cast with no weak links whatsoever,everyone shines.I never get tired of watching this film,it improves with each viewing!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This Facebook app is awesome! I can see what my friends have posted just like I'm looking at it on my bigger computer at home. Helps me keep with people during my long 10 hour days at work!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't get enough of this game. Its fun and addicting. More you play without crashing it gets faster and faster. Play it on my amazon kindle hd and can not get enough of this game. A must play..
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Maybe because I grew up watching Star Trek on TV; hitting my &#34;teen-ager-movie-stride&#34; as the movie trilogies were released, this is how it all started. Great movie!
B004DHUAZQ|3.0|Entertaining move about old &#34;macho&#34; men, still trying to keep up their image.  Not a &#34;chick&#34; flick.  Was an enjoyable movie.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|To me it's not bright enough, i'd like have narrowed light and stronger with better design, it must be cuter.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|i loved this movie and thought it was very entertaining, i would recommend it to all my friends, it also had some funny parts it in too..
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is classified under young adult fiction, though I wouldn't let my 14 year old read it. It is about college age students who have an obsessive love hate relationship. It was hard to put down, I really loved it.
1452101248|4.0|Beautiful and fascinating.  Many many great ideas.  But many of the recipes are a bit too exotic and probably not useful.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It ok, I like it more on the Ipad 2 but you are able to use it on the Kindle Fire
B004B63M1S|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Got it for a great price. It shipped very fast. Works great. I'm very pleased.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|what starts out so simply winds its way into a truly modern tale depicting love and loss<br />give it a chance and you'll be surprised
0547884591|5.0|I am familiar with Timothy Ferriss' work, and reputation, so I was ready when I found out this work was published.  I was drawn to it because it is formatted in a way that is similar to what I do when I produce a recipe.  This, however, is much more thorough and innovative than anything I have done. A total cooking klutz could produce a five star dish with ease by following the way that Timothy writes and SHOWS the reader how to prepare a fine dish.
B008K8U13K|3.0|This game says it only takes up 1.2 MB, but if you buy it it says to run an extra 100 MB. It is a waste of storage, but otherwise, it a great game.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Love the scenery, the music is upbeat, and just got to love Meryl Streep. How are some people born with so much talent and I can't do anything. Anyway, I just think it will be fun to have around when I am feeling down
B005VR91UW|5.0|This is Little Richard's debut album. in which his rollicking boogie-woogie piano and falsetto scream ignited the unfettered ossibilities of rock &^ roll.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Got it for a great price. It shipped very fast. Works great. I'm very pleased.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Harry is always good for a light quick read;  and I am hooked on Harry so go for another episode.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I will never forget the first notes that susan sang on her US debut, or the look on Simon's face.  This album is a good mix of variety and reveals more of Susan's diverse talent.  Personally, I don't much care for the religious songs, but they are easy to skip.
B004YM6JLO|4.0|Well acted, Plot good seems a little repetitive in action sequences could be alittle more action orientated.overall a good show
0547569653|4.0|Really 3 out of 5 stars, but I'll give Scott 4 stars because he<br />does seem like a nice enough guy.  This book was as slow as<br />molasses at times, but it picked up momentum towards the end.<br />But at times, I must admit, I felt as if I was running my own ultra<br />readathon in attempting to overcome my boredom with this book.<br />It was a hardcore snoozer at points, folks.  Right when I was about to<br />nod off when reading about another ultra Scott was telling us<br />he'd ran, I'd sit up and scream, \\"Are we there yet, ma?\\" and<br />then realize I was not in fact on a long trip with my mother,<br />but in my bed with Eat and Run.  Okay, not really.  But you<br />catch my drift.<br /><br />I almost, almost, almost gave up on this book when Scott proudly<br />proclaimed that he read Noam Chomsky and listened to Amy<br />Goodman.  Ooooookay.  So, in other words, you despise Israel,<br />detest Judaism and Zionism, and embrace the totalitarian ideology of the<br />hardcore Left.  And that has what to do with running?  At times<br />I felt Scott was trying to elevate himself, and that to me is<br />just boring.  And if I had a nickel for every time he rapped on<br />about veganism, I could buy that new computer I so desperately<br />need.  I definitely got a leftist, I'm above-it-all, hippie<br />vibe from certain parts of this book, and that did nothing to<br />endear this read to me.<br /><br />Be that as it may, and despite himself, Scott seems to be an<br />alright guy.  If it weren't for his continual bashing of his<br />father throughout the book, his subtle ways of sneaking in his<br />political agenda, his proclivity to tell all about the private<br />lives of his friends and family (gossip is gossip even when it is<br />in written form), and his obvious obsession with himself, his running,<br />and his journey in life, I liked this book okay.  Scott loved to remind<br />us that he was valedictorian of his high school class and how<br />well he did incollege.  Not so subtle.  Toot, toot.  What he's really<br />trying to tell us, folks, is that he's right and we're wrong and we<br />should listen to him.<br /><br />I did take away a few good things from this book, like when<br />he writes about what it means to be dead tired after a run and<br />get up the next morning and run again, even if you don't feel like it.<br />And little tidbits like what's more important, staying home and<br />watching TV or going out for a run?  Motivational gems as such is what<br />keeps me going when I don't want to run, and I wish this book had<br />more of it.  You'll see a lot of very subtle ego in this book, folks.<br />The devil is in the detail, but I guess for a person to succeed in this<br />sport, one has to have an overinflated sense of self.  In other words,<br />Scott can't help himself.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, 2 and a half stars.....
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|I laughed lot while playing this game or the first time!! my son just got me a new Kindle  Fire for Christmas and I'm learning how to use it and I thought I would try a game. I obviusly have to get better at controling the kart but it ws a hoot!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I rented this first because of the mixed reviews, but I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. I'm a fan of the original series with Matt Damon, but I encourage first-time viewers not to begin by comparing this one to those, because there are some differences. First, I thought Jeremy Renner did an excellent job. He's a much different actor than Damon, so he brought something new to the Bourne series. The on-screen pair up with Rachel Weisz was genius--I thought they played excellently off each other and their chemistry was just right. I suppose I didn't dissect the script too much because I was looking for a great action movie and that's what I got, but I didn't feel the writing was bad either. The scenery in the beginning of the movie was breathtaking, which is always a bonus for me. Those looking for another Bourne movie like the originals may be disappointed (though I honestly don't know why they would be), but those looking for a fun, non-stop action movie with some drama, and great acting by some great stars, would likely enjoy this movie. It's also clean (discounting the violence). I'll definitely watch and buy any other movies Renner does for this series--they just need to recast Weisz with him!
B007HACDLK|3.0|Held my interest for the first few chapters but then it became labored and very hard to relate to any reality.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I can't wait until number two comes out this summer! My Grandson calls this the &#34;bouncy movie&#34;, because of all the minions that jump around in this movie; they make the movie not only different, but fun!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|One of the better action hero films –– script was well written, lots of humour, well acted, and very well directed.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I find it an easy to use handy app. Love it.<br />When I get too busy to remember to charge my kindle, the voice notification reminds me.

B0070XFNDE|5.0|This is a beautifully written and atmospheric work in true Ruiz Zafon style. A mystery that captivates you through exscuisite use of language and description. Beautiful.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this little gem has saved me many headaches from not remembering to plug in my fire. it's simple and functional. love it.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This is a must have for anybody with a collection of Christmas movies. This is by far my favorite Christmas movie ever!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app,  it has done all i have needed it to. use it to help with paying the bills each month. large numbers. make it easy too.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|I thought this was a great film. Is it Oliver Stone's best film? No, but it's definitely worth seeing in my opinion. The negative reviews I read seem to either have higher expectations that they didn't feel were met, complained about the ending, or thought it wasn't realistic. I'm not sure what part they didn't think was realistic, but those reviewers must not be very familiar with the violence of the Mexican cartels.
0618871713|5.0|How is it to grow up in a funeral home?  This book will tell you that and a lot more
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love it... just wish there was a way to resign games that were accidentally started. otherwise fun game! love playing it!

B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is so funny with a twist of educational sarcasm. If you are interested in some science with some boy and girl relationships, it's yours
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I've seen the order Ice Age movies and they always make me laugh.  This was no exception.  A little scary I think for small kids.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This movie was hilarious and the animation was just amazing. I would recommend the film to people of all ages.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|A wonderfully entertaining app! At first I was afraid I'd have to invest lots of money to actually play, but you get free plays every day! I play with my 11 yr old and have LOADS of fun together. (She explains the technological parts for me :))  It's really alot of fun! The only part I don't like is the foul language that many of the players use. But, I simply &#34;hide&#34; the &#34;discussion&#34; panel and that puts an end to that issue! I highly recommend this ap!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app has a lot of features.  I only use it as a simple notepad.  I've tried others and bond of them have good interfaces.  Evernote has a good simple interface.  And my notes sync between my phone, tablet, and online.
B004WGIXX4|2.0|THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL. VERY BORING MOVIE THAT IS EXCRUCIATINGLY PREDICTABLE. I COULD NOT WATCH THE ENTIRE MOVIE. PORTMAN'S ACTING COULD NOT SAVE THIS TRASH. THE OTHER ACTORS CLEARLY DISPLAYED THEIR SHAME TO BE IN A MOVIE THAT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PAY CHECK FOR THEM.
B009POCFTG|5.0|A great movie, a great cast and not for the squeamish. This is black comedy at its blackest! I really liked the movie and it is a credit to the actors that you really don't like their characters. They are scummy, nasty, vicious and pitch perfect.<br />I believe this is a modern masterpiece and shows just how great William Friedkin can be. He nailed this and made a movie for adults. Well deserved NC-17. Appropriate for sure. Just once in a while Hollywood can make a truly awesome piece of cinema.<br />Matthew M., who I never warmed to as an actor, was stunning! What a wonderful performance. Sick, creepy, debauched, mean, charming... I could go on. The other cast members were superb!<br />While this will often shock folk and make them squirm for sure, it is movie making at its best. A must see! Don't take the kids.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Another great movie.  Watch it whenever I need a pick-me-up...and now with the music I can 'get here' easily.  Great music!
B00A0ZMBAW|5.0|Even in cable they even cut this movie. Very surprised about that. But here.. The HD is great and sharp. Its uncut and saw a lot of parts that I haven't saw at all.. Great movie!*
1419705849|5.0|Great book for kids, bur seeing it's a gift for Christmas for our 7& 8 years old son and daughter, this review is early. I know they will like it, they have all the other books.
B008M34INW|3.0|The trailer was good, but the video was not what I expected, although I think Mel Gibson has made some good movies.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Outlander has everything I love in a book, its a very well-written adventure-romance-time travel-historical novel.  The characters are complex and surprising, the plot twists are engrossing and the history is personal and lively. The intimate relationships are both sweetly romatic and baudy. I also enjoy the medical background and the ways medicine is practiced in different times. Its kept me going so that now I'm on the 4th novel in the series.  Its also a hefty chunk of writing so I really feel I'm getting my money's worth. I would highly recommend the Outlander to all my reading friends, I want to follow these characters where ever they go.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Funny and teaches love and respect for others. Great family film. I have watched it many times with my children and grandchildren. It is our favorite Christmas movie.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Gave this as a gift as well.  This will join my library of baseball movie classics.  Brad Pitt is getting older with no attempts to hide it..which is even more sexy.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box<br /><br />I really like Connelly. Harry is ok. But I really like Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer. Bring him back, Michael.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Am very happy with this CD. Felt it was one of her best yet and hope to have many, many more of this quality.  They picked the kind of songs she is good at and they could pick more that show the quality and extent of her voice.  Will buy more when available.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I am a huge fan of comic book movies & Joss Whedon did an amazing job making this movie! I had huge expectations for this movie and was not disappointed in the least! I can't believe how funny this movie was. All around excellent movie!
B001F12J48|1.0|If you are new to 3-D and have a 3-D TV -- This is not the product you want....The effect is not intended for 3-D with blue ray players....  It is not real 3-D and will not work at all.  Get the Blue ray version...In fact always make sure you are getting blue ray 3-D and even this is no guarantee that the effects will be 'spectacular' ....as you would expect. (check reviews and some will give you the scoop for most films)  I will not say that this item is a marketing 'scam' as the paper glasses that are provide may provide a small 3-D effect on a standard HD large screen but EVERYONE I spoke to about this 'type' of 3-D hated it ....and most ended up with a headache, (as I did)  trying to make it 'work'.!  Good luck!!!,  IG...
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is the first time my husband and I watched this movie - at the insistence of 5 of our grandchildren who recited most of the dialogue throughout the movie.  Really good message of the power of family.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Bought this for a gift for a friend of mine.  Have mailed it to him, so I'll have to wait to see if he likes it, as much as I do.  Have seen it many times, and think it's great!
B005AC65TS|5.0|If you like John Hiatt's music, this album comes in as a &#34;must have&#34; album.  Well worth the cost.  Buy it.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Was very ahppy with this DVD. Will buy more of Phantom when available.  Have all but one that have been made and can't find that one.  This was a very well done Phantom and even a little better than the ones that I have seen at the theatre.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is the walking dead first season got for xmas gift for my bro. Its in perfect condition and everything you expect from a blu ray.
B00447G2PM|5.0|If you are new to 3-D ...you will like this ....Overall - Real 3-D, lots of good (off-screen) effects....if you have a 3-D TV w Blue Ray....Overall - Good 'action move' for the entire family
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Seasons..<br />Lots of different games and levels.  keeps you entertained.  My grandson loves it. easy to access and fun to play
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|The movie is iconic, but the book is the source.  Truman Capote wrote such great characters.  Light-hearted banter does not necessarily mean superficial feelings.  Read this novella for yourself.  You will be surprised at the details and depth not revealed in the movie. Additionally, I purchased the Kindle version which came with more Capote short stories after the novella.  Wonderful.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Nice charges and protects the headset. I wish the case will locked in place when the lid is closed, but still better than no case at all.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|This is a most powerfull music of this year, the old band blows out All the younger crews with its passion, energy, freedom
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I prefer nonfiction to fiction.  SEALS amaze me.  it was good and despite the press I can't imagine what operational details were included.  Certainly nothing that I didn't already know.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Building your book for Kindle is an extremely comprehensive and well detailed way in which you can format your book for sales on Amazon. In fact, it takes me anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes to format a book. And that is going slow and snail like! I really liked the screenshots, which helped me where there were no instructions.<br />Here are some other formatting tips, which I use to format my e-books. Writers are going to find them useful.<br />Save a copy. So Book A, save as Book A Formatted. That way, if something goes horribly wrong, you still have the old, pre-formatted book.<br />This is for word 2007. Under View, set it to Draft and press the show all button. This is going to help in spacing.<br />Select the entire document with ctrl + a. Change the font to Times New Roman. Don't care what your personal favorite font is. Just need the document uniform, and a standard font. TNR does the trick. While you're doing this, go ahead and set the font size to 12.<br /> While everything is currently still selected, right click -> paragraph. There's a couple things to do here. Under spacing, set `before' to 0 and `after' to 10 pt (do not leave them blank).  Set the spacing itself to Single. Hit ok.<br /><br /> Still with whole document selected, go to your ruler up at the top (if you can't see it, go to the view tab up at the top and click the checkmark `ruler' to make it visible). You should see the little marker used for indents. Drag everything all the way to the left. Then, adjusting the top triangle only (the one for First Line Indent) drag it forward to .5 inches, which forms a nice first line indent on digital devices.<br /> Hit ctrl + f to open up the Find menu, then click the Replace tab. In the find tab, type ^t while in the replace tab, leave it blank. This will delete all the manual tabs (which you should never, ever use). Hit replace all.<br /> Clear the find tab, and type in ^l (that's a lower case L) in the find, and in the replace, ^p. This is going toformat your paragraphs.<br /><br />I found this particularly useful, especially when there were plenty of spaces between the words showing up as double dots where a single dot should be.<br />Clear the find tab, and then put in two spaces. In the replace section, hit the spacebar once. This will find any hidden sections where you accidentally hit the space bar twice while typing. Hit replace all. Hit replace all again.<br />Next, in the find tab, type in \\" .\\" That's a space followed by a period (don't type the quotation marks, just using them to help show the spaces). In the replace, type just a period. Same idea, except for accidental gaps between words and the period at the end. Hit replace all.<br /> Some of you might have underlined instead of italicizing things. Well, we want them in italics now. So clear the find section, and with cursor within, hit ctrl + u. In the replace, again clear it out, put in the cursor, and hit ctrl + i. Hit replace all.<br /><br /> Moving on to ellipses. In the find, type in \\"...\\" while in the replace, this is what I want you to do. With the cursor inside, hold down your alt key on your keyboard, and then on your number pad hit in order, 0133. Let go of the alt key. Hit replace all. Now in the find, go ahead and write \\"...\\" while leaving the ellipses alone in the replace. Hit replace all.<br /><br />10. Dashes, em dashes, all evil! Okay, in the find, type in \\"--\\". That's two regular dashes side by side. With cursor in the replace, hold the alt key and then on the number pad hit 0151. When you let go, you should have: - instead. Hit replace all.<br />11. Still using the find/replace. We'll do two more here, both similar. First, in the find, type in \\" ^p\\", and in the replace, just \\"^p\\". Do this again with \\"^p \\", leaving the replace part still as \\"^p\\". This will get rid of any spaces before or after paragraph breaks, which can jack up formatting on certain devices.<br /> Okay, go ahead and close the find and replace tool. We're movingon to the next (very) common problem. Do not, under any circumstances, try to form new pages by doing anything other than hitting ctrl + enter on your keyboard.<br />All right, now start scrolling through your document, specifically going to each individual chapter break. If you see the evil line of P's, delete them, and use ctrl + enter to place in an actual page break.<br /><br />I am indebted to a good soul on the net who posted these instructions. I am passing them on. Three cheers for keyboard shortcuts!
B009FBX5M0|5.0|We love this soundtrack.  The movie was excellent, and the music really added to the experience.  This was bought for a Bond fan and a fan of Adele - so it's the perfect combination.  Adele does a great job with the title song - it reflects her unique sound, but still remains true to the Bond tradition.
B003OFHMKO|3.0|Not what I thought it would be.  She won an award thought I would like this.  Not so much.  Sorry
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I very much liked it.  It reminds me of some of the earlier books he wrote.  It held my interest throughout.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Awesome book recommend it, dragon of happiness flew out of my eyes after reading this book,my brain is exploding with happy clowns
0307352145|5.0|Read this if you are an introvert or want to understand almost half of the people that will surround you
B000NDMRDW|5.0|Exciting, interesting and stimulates thinking.  Makes one think about first Ice Age and is another possible. What about a Heat Age from global warming?
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Great DVD of the first season - no problems with it and have been enjoying watching. Highly recommend as a gift or as good addition to your DVD collection for rainy nights!
0783229526|4.0|Son had this on Christmas list.  He was Happy, and so was Mama.  I have not seen this myself but intend to borrow.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Good enough for me to want to read the next one as soon as I have time.  I would favorably compare it to 'The Pillars of the Earth'.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|I'm generally not one to tune in for shows.  No DVR to speak of and no interest in scheduling my days around primetime sitcoms and dramas.  Until Dexter.  I can thank my wife for that.  I'm a late arrival, but I'm working feverishly to make up for lost time.  We got married in October.  Her weekly tradition of sitting down at 9:00 on Sundays for Dexter moved in with her.  I passively absorbed bits and pieces of several episodes in season 7.  Then I started asking questions.  Then I started to like it.  Then I ordered season 1.  And 2.  And 3.  And 4.  This all in the course of two weeks no less.  It was very not me, but mid way through season 1 I was officially hooked.  I analyze, guess, and wonder.  Some of the surprise is inevitably lost when you get your first taste in the 7th season, but there is no shortage of surprises.  The premise is unique.  The characters are intriguing.  The writing, in my opinion, is quite good.  The first season lays a wonderful foundation for all that is to follow.  As a skeptic myself, I can say that there is a good chance you will be hooked by the 4th episode if you give it even half a chance.  Then just enjoy the dark, honest, twisted yet curious ride to follow!
B009ZE27US|5.0|Not that it did the following times, but c'mon people, it's a gag app - It's not supposed too.  Still, thought it was kinda amusing.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|just loved the whole season<br />going to buy the rest soon<br />I highly recommend it to friends and family and Sci-fi fans
B008XOXGCO|5.0|Arrived quickly and was as good as I expected. Would recommend this cd to any script fans! Sounds like some of their other songs but is definitely worth it.
6304806434|4.0|Great movie.  Gave it as a gift.  I enjoyed watching the movie myself, after I gave it I borrowed it back.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Listen to his lyrics -- very talented with the use of words.  I really liked his other album, &#34;Cold Fact&#34; and this one is really good too.  I'm very surprised he is not more popular and appreciated here in the US.  Radio stations should play his music so more people can be exposed to such a gifted talent.  If you haven't seen the documentry &#34;Searching for Sugar man&#34;, do yourself a favor and see it.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Loved this book!!!!  Easy to read especially on the Kindle.  Fantastic conclusion to the Inheritance Cycle Series.  Hopefully Paolini doesn't leave the world of Alegasia behind.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Diehard is without a doubt the quintessential action movie of the 80s. It was Bruce Willis first big movie after his stint on moonlighting which was a brilliant show as well. But back to diehard. Diehard takes place in one area in one area alone Century City in LA at the Nokia Tomie building. The story revolves around Bruce Willis's character John MacLean. He's a cop from New York is just there to visit his wife when terrorists decide to drop in for the Christmas party. He's the flying the ointment of their perfect plan. While diehard does take place in one place the building the director and writer did a brilliant job of making it seem that it took place in many places. The acting even by the supporting cast is very good especially Alan Rickman. Joel Silver did a brilliant job producing this movie and the director did a great job as well. So what is the cut off for those who enjoy the movie and those won't age wise. I would say the cut off is about 14 to really enjoy the movie. Even though the movie sounds simple on its surface it's really quite complex in some areas. I don't think anyone under the age of 10 would enjoy the movie or should even watch it. There's violence and brief nudity and overall someone is cussing about every 15 minutes. It's not a family action-adventure movie like Pirates of the Caribbean. But it is a smart movie even though it has a simple premise. I would give it eight out of 10 just for production value alone. What really makes the movie though is Bruce Willis he is the centerpiece without him there really wouldn't of been a diehard or the movies that followed afterwards. If you enjoy diehard you'll enjoy all the other ones after it and I highly recommend this movie. Have a good day<br /><br />Allen W Yoakum
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This stand is great! The snaps work perfectly to hold your Kindle tight. It is flexible but strong enough to stand while you are multitasking. Reasonable price. Great value.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|this is one of our favorite of the Dr. Suess movies. it has helped my autistic daughter to understand caring and helping even if you can not see the need
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Since reading Plum Island, I am a huge John Corey fan. I always find myself laughing out loud at the sarcastic or ironic asides. My biggest problem with the Panther that the confrontation with anti-hero doesn't begin until more than 80% of the book is read. Too much set up and not enough action. My positive rating is due to the fact I can't get enough of John Corey!
B00A3AU1U6|5.0|Subtle and brilliant, as always with Eno. Makes you pay attention for the innovative just noticeable differences, but also works as a perfect pleasant soporific.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book and awesome finale to the Hunger Games trilogy.  Can't wait until they make all 3 movies
B00015YVD6|4.0|Splash was a good movie in the 80s and it's a good movie now. It's a fun movie to watch with family or by yourself. I must've seen it at least 10 times on cable and as many times on DVD and it never gets boring. This is Tom Hanks first big movie and I believe it was there all Hannah's first big movie as well. As I said it's a fun movie to watch not just for Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah but also the supporting cast and the story as well. Not to mention this is a great movie from Ron Howard and his company. Overall I would give splash in 8.5 out of 10. It's something you'll remember and make sure you stay till the end there's about 4 or 5 seconds that are worth watching. I won't ruin the surprise but it's worth watching till the start of the credits. So enjoy splash and have a great day. Allen W Yoakum
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|IT IS AWESOME!!! I love the game! I recommend this to everyone! But you still might have to pay for somethings.
B002ZG999U|5.0|we like all the one liners taken from the movie characters of the actors other movies we will be watching it again .
B00APUYWYA|4.0|great movie to watch with your daughter,it make you want to sing during and after.i watch the ending performance twice.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was great. I really enjoyed the story line.  The audio and sequences were very good. The graphics were also impressive.  I would recommend this game for download.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This music is timeless. Heard the orignal which was good. This remastered is really good. Worth the money spent .
B00000ILDE|5.0|It was the summer of sequels there was a Star Trek movie and Indiana Jones movie and a few others that I really can't recall but you can remember aliens. It was the perfect action adventure movie for the summer and it's the perfect action adventure now for someone who's seen it 1 million times or someone who's never seen it. The special effects even though there from 1985 still hold up. The acting is top notch for an ensemble cast of only one person that was a big star which was Sigourney Weaver. She was the only holdover from the original alien movie and basically the story centers around her. Aliens special edition is a longer movie than the theatrical release and it's worth the 20 minutes that you have to watch the movie for. What was cut from the theatrical version really did not impact the overall story but with the added material in the special edition you get a much more rounded movie. As I said before the acting is top notch especially the character Newt. She and Ripley played by Sigourney Reaver are what really makes the movie the interaction and especially the end of the movie. Of course you can't talk about an alien movie without talking about the aliens they are almost a force of nature something that just kills and kills and kills. If you never seen aliens special edition I envy you are in for a hell of a ride. Overall I would give aliens 10 out of 10. Everything holds up in the movie and it should of been nominated for an Oscar for wasn't James Cameron didn't brilliant job of turning a war movie in an action adventure movie and putting them together into a seamless product. Enjoy aliens and I highly recommend the sequels to it have a good day.<br /><br />Allen W Yoakum
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I was 100% satisfied with this purchasing experience!  I love music and though I had some difficultty transferring to ringtones, it was due to my inexperience ;)  The music sounded excellent and transferred rapidly :)  jbsings thanks you!!!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|this is my 8 year old most requested movies of the year. love the Dr. Suess movies. even my 4 year old enjoyed it
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I recently installed this on my new MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion.  I now see it crash 2-3 time each reading session.  Not the best app...
B005QUQP76|3.0|The Good:<br /><br />Software and features are fantastic. It runs fine off of plug and play.<br />The teflon feet are large giving lots of surface area making it feel like it \\"floats\\" across mousing surfaces.<br />All buttons have a great clicky feedback feel.<br />The frame is solid metal, the mouse feels overall very durable.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Most of this is preference, but overall its quite heavy.<br />The shape is also odd: Palm is very high IMO, thumb buttons are made as if your thumb is as long as your other fingers.<br />Oddity: When lifting my mouse for centering, the bottom right corner drags on my mousing surface.<br /><br />If you claw grip, the thumb buttons are even farther away.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Oh how Muse does it again.  Of course it is a great new sound. Muse has evolved. You won't go wrong with this!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Some of the songs and the vocals sound weak and too soft.  The speaking during Master of the House is distracting and takes away from the song any lyrics.  Neither of the actors playing the Thernadiers are good singers.  Some of the orchestrations and versions of these songs are changed alot.  I am having a hard time getting used to Russell Crowe's voice.  Amanda Seyfried is one of my favorite performers.  I don't like her singing in this movie and liked it better in Mamma Mia.  Young Cossette is a great little singer and I bet actress too.  Samantha Banks is the best, because she is a stage performer.  I have heard Hugh Jackman is too, but hers is the strongest performance to me.  I am trying to get used to Anne Hathaway's singing.  The performers and the movie probably should not be compared to the stage version.  I am surprised the actor playing Marius can sing.  I wish they would release a complete recording eventually.  A highlights CD is not enough.  I think they did a good job and I am glad I own it, even if I think it is better on stage.  I don't know why some think it is not as good to have it sung powerfully and beautifully on stage.  I feel the stage version captures the emotion just as well.  Just in a different way.  It leaves me bawling too.  It needs to be sung louder and such in live theater.  It is easy to compare, but this movie and the stage version are not intended to be done in a comparable manner and in the same way.  I am seeing it Christmas night.<br /> :-)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Just read this book, I cannot give it justice in this review. It is not the best book I ever read but it has more heart, love and truth in it than any other book I have read. Read the book.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Best book can't wait to read the second book<br />I recommend this book to everyone.draws your attention.READ the book!<br />  Great
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Everybody thinks it is this apps fault for all this bad things but it's not the apps fault!!! Thanks for reading!
B000022TSH|1.0|I realize that it was used and very inexpensive but the dvd gets stock towards the end of the movie and the scene selection part  does not work. I did not send it back because I only paid something like $ 15.00 .
0547884591|5.0|Learning is always a challenge for most people and they are label &#34;untalented&#34;. With this book, you are able to create miracles,doing the unexpected and Live the Good Life. Life in High Definition is possible once you learn about this book's method stated by Tim Ferriss. Highly recommended to my friends.
B008K8U13K|1.0|First off why does it need WiFi to play the game, secondly I want my dollar back because this won't load at all!
B005LAIIQC|1.0|I love the Bourne series, and was SUPER excited to see who was going to be replacing Matt Damon. GREAT casting, TERRIBLE script. It amounts to little more than a (very badass) junkie, looking for a fix. Essentially two hours of \\"where can I find these drugs?\\" I can see how this was more of a bridge film so that it could break away from Jason Bourne's story, but they did a shoddy job of it, as they broadly reference Jason Bourne in snippets for no real reason. It was an awkward film, and with as much as i love the Bourne franchise, I was surprised at how bored I was.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Well written and acted. Worth the investment in time to watch. This trilogy works and is obviously  not complete yet.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Not my kind of movie. It was all over the place. Very Hollywood with lots of Hollywood style antics. I like movies with a touch of substance. Dancers were all beautiful though and so is Catherine Zeta Jones, always great energy and sexy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hi I am A Dairy of a wimpy kid lover so I loved the book and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!!!!!! :)
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|Jeremy Renner was a great replacement for Jason Bourne , I like the movie alot . A must see for the Bourne fans.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Although he didn't hit my radar as an actor until the last decade or so, Robert Downy Jr has found himself in the role of Holmes and it is a spectacular fit. Although it seems to be Iron Man in British dubbing, it is a great character for him, and Jude Law is a GREAT sidekick. Loved it.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|This movie was just \\"ok\\" for me and my children. It was very slow at parts and seemed to have \\"filler\\" scenes. I can't complain too much, though, because the price couldn't be beat and it does teach a good lesson about the environment.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an excellent book.  Great characters, and th story was interesting and you couldn't figure out the plot until the end.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|FUN movie! I have learned now that whatever movies the critics rate poorly is actually a GOOD movie! (and the reciprocal is also true!).  No wonder the critics hated this, it reflected our military in a positive light!
B0045XKJBI|5.0|good chick flick! Also recommend reading the books. Neat way to own and watch the movie with the instant downloading. Quick and easy.
B009MF56GC|5.0|It is better than the first, which doesn't say much, but for someone whose husband was positively thrilled while watching both, I can honestly say this one was at least bearable... and didn't hesitate to make fun of itself and find the humor in it all. It didn't try too hard, which the first one definitely did. For what it is, it was great. Didn't expect it to be particularly deep or thought provoking. LOTS of one-liners and explosions. What more could you ask for?
1419705849|5.0|Great book for kids.

I am always waiting for new one.Good recomendation for parents.<br />[[ASIN:1481051229 Dragon Empire: When balance is lost]]
B0017SWPXY|5.0|After reading this book I look at my dog through different eyes.  Well written...cried my eyes out at the end.<br />I
0062127241|5.0|An honest, open, unique insight into an incredible creative talent. The book is well written and the photos are interesting!
030759565X|5.0|Lots of great recipes with pictures of the food and easy to follow instructions. All of the breakfast an dessert recipes look amazing.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|Good special effects, good cgi, weak plot and acting, but I didn't watch it to be blown away. For what it is, it is just ok.
1588167461|4.0|I found this book a great start on the basics of mens style, but it runs out of detail when you start to ask detailed questions (for example, it would be nice to have a section on materials (wool, cotton, blends, ... and when each is appropriate), and the pictures are too small to show sufficient detail.<br /><br />That said and knowing what I know now, if you do what the book says you'll have a functional professional wardrobe. But you won't really know why it works.
B00770KR7W|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son. He has many action figures from McFarlane. They are durable and he loves them. I had problems with the seller, however, the product itself is great.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|It doesn't seem to be the end of the series, but the future is uncertain...  Great movie, with action, sexual tension, and the ongoing story of the guy who's been cast-out as a villain by his city.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love all of the Twilight movies and this is no exception.  The special affects are amazing.  I can hardly wait to see the second part.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Great casting! I actually missed this film, hadn't seen it until AFTER Avengers. It is better to have watched this first, I realize, but I never even knew it came out. After half of The Avengers going clear over my head, I decided I should probably watch Thor. I really liked it. The only thing I didn't love was there was a little too much attention given to Natalie Portman's character, who we now know makes no cameos in the Avengers.
044024630X|5.0|This book takes us back in time to just before Reacher is downsized from the Service. Military corruption, bad guys to terminate with extreme prejudice, a beautiful women to &#34;partner&#34; with. Classic Jack Reacher elements in another twisty action packed adventure.<br /><br />Plus there is a short story at the end that gives a back story on Reacher and his brother as kids moving to a new army base that gives insight to how Reacher began solving crimes/mysteries. Read the book to find out more.<br /><br />(Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher? Isn't Tom 5' 6&#34; and Reacher 6' 4&#34;? WTF????)
B005MYEQ9U|3.0|Recently I watched the July 1986 Bregenzer Fest production conducted by Patane on the web, and by Jove, I like that one much more than this 2011 production, though also in Vienna!<br />Viennesse audiences are probably too forgetful,especially the media, to hail this version as the best since Callas and Sutherland.<br />Netrebko has more voice than Katia Ricciarelli in 1986 (a rather late period of the latter's career), but in termsm of vocal acting and drama, Katia is miles ahead of Anna.  Katia's singing is not only much more stylish (she has ALL then fiorature), her ability to shade phrases and bring out nuances are something that are so evidently superior to Netrebko's rather basic rendition.<br />As for Seymour, Garanca is on par with Tocysz vocally, but notn dramatically.  Her Seymour is an rather insipid character, and it is difficult to figure out why Henry VIII would fall for her in Boleyn's stead.<br />Nestrenko is, even if no longer in his vocal prime, a preferred King Henry over D'arcahgelo, who was ill in this performance, alas.<br />The major difference between this and the Bregenz performance is the scene between Bolene and Percy.  In then Bregenz version, the Percy was portrayed ton great artistic height (not just vocal or muscial, but also dramatic) by Francisco Araiza, who sung all the high notes of the role without the slightest qualm, and gave the character of Percy such a colourful portrayal that really stands on full footing with the rest of Henry, Seymour and Boleyn, some thing that NO single tenor is capable of today! Not least Meli here.
0374275637|5.0|Reading this book is a real world lesson in its content.<br /><br />The author plays with his readers, invoking \\"System 1\\" - or fast thinking - responses with his story-telling and his heartfelt tributes to people who have touched his own heart while also greatly contributing to this book's content.<br /><br />But the author is also challenging us to do our own \\" System 2\\" thinking - the slower, harder type of cognition - as we struggle to absorb the valuable lessons, placed like the accretted pearls of his lifetime,  delicately within the \\"System 1\\" flesh of this truly wonderful book.<br /><br />I admit that I was not able to finish reading the book in the time I had it from my local library.  But I bought it so that I could do the \\"System 2\\" thinking his book was enticing me into on my own schedule.<br /><br />It is well worth the investment of time and money, and I thank the author for making the effort to gift his lifetime of research in a form accessible to the ordinary non-specialist who is willing to engage in a bit of slower, harder thinking - and in exchange is gifted with this extraordinary body of knowledge.<br /><br />My life is bettered by the knowledge in this book - I can offer no higher praise from this reader to any writer.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I took my grandson to the movies to see it and we both loved it.  I bought a dvd for me and one for him when they came out.  I leant this dvd to many co-workers and they agreed it was a great movie.  You wouldn't think a grandmother would be interested in robots but it isn't just about robots it is a very heart warming story.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|Someone needs to tell Johnny Depp to stop taking these films. Sure, it's a paycheck... but at what cost? Another bad role to chalk up to Depp's friendship with Tim Burton.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is a great game I love pacman sooooooo much!!!!!! My mom Jude's to play this game all the time in high school.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I chose 5/5 stars. I like this book because it is funny. I recommend this book to grades 2-8. Or to keep it specific, ages 7-13.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Amazon scores a home run once more! They had this the day it was released, at a lesser price than everyone else and shipped for free with Amazon Prime! For vinyl collectors this is great, the vinyl is a heavier better grade, the one thing that would have made it better would been if they released the original &#34;butcher&#34; cover on the album art, but they didn't.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|THIS BOOK IS A DIFFERENCT TACK FROM STEPHEN KING.  A GOOD READ~~~ A WHAT IF??????? GOOD CHARACTER DESCRIPTON. RECOMMEDED FOR THE ADULT READER.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I bought the Bluray thinking (incorrectly) that the second disc was going to be regular DVD. Since it wasn't, I was in the market for a regular DVD copy to watch on my other players and my kids to watch in the car. This version didn't just come with the DVD and digital copy, but also came with an Amazon Instant Video copy as well. So, now we can watch it literally anywhere, on any of our devices. I bought it for 14.99 and even if it ends up getting cheaper as time goes on, I think that was a great deal - especially since it includes the Amazon Instant Video copy.
B001F290E4|5.0|Happy w/ purchase. Thank you for a great product !  I feel like if I was late to the party;  recently, I discovered how great this artist is.<br /><br />๏[-ิ_•ิ]๏
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Just to hear them perform Kashmir at the London show is sublime. The rest of the album is pretty good too!
B001FOPODS|5.0|I have always loved this music.  This is hands-down the best visual treatment so far--and not likely to be outdone any time soon.  Stunning animation, believable characters, humor and heart....and a fresh interpretation of the story.
B009P5S11G|5.0|[...]  I wrote this review before the album came out.  It is just as good as the last two.  My favorite song by far is the duet, \\"Stay,\\"  but some other highlights are \\"No Love Allowed,\\" \\"Numb,\\" and \\"Jump.\\"
B004EPYZV2|1.0|Can we stop pretending like Tom Cruise is a believable badass? MAYBE when he was younger, MAYBE in the first MI film... but definitely not anymore. Snoozefest.
B001S86J0I|5.0|My husband and I have been a fan of this movie when we first rented it 10 years ago.  We've always wanted a copy but have never seen it in the stores.<br /><br />Galaxy Quest is a spoof of Star Trek.  Everyone who ever liked the Star Trek series must watch this movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|i enjoyed reading it and had a hard time putting it down. i would recommend it to everyone. fun book.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Ms Joyce takes you on a journey not only through her home England, but through the often-tortured but always sympathetic psyche of her protagonist.  A page-turner that compels you to think, as well.
B007R21JJK|3.0|I paired this with:<br />[[ASIN:B001EYV690 OCZ ModXStream Pro 600W Modular High Performance Power Supply compatible with Intel Sandy Bridge Core i3 i5 i7 and AMD Phenom]]<br />[[ASIN:B007SZ0E1K Intel Core i5-3570K Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 4 Core  LGA 1155 - BX80637I53570K]]<br />[[ASIN:B003O8J11E Cooler Master Elite 430 - Mid Tower Computer Case with All-Black Interior (RC-430-KWN1)]]<br />[[ASIN:B004CRSM4I Corsair Vengeance 8 GB ( 2 x 4 GB ) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) 240-Pin DDR3 Memory Kit for  Core i3, i5, i7 and  Platforms SDRAM CMZ8GX3M2A1600C9]]<br /><br />Installation was fairly easy with Windows 7 (64bit) ultimate. Overall this system is very fast, boots up in around 20seconds with an SSD drive.<br /><br />I didn't try the overclocking options yet (though I realize that is the main selling point!).<br /><br />I updated all the firmware and drivers to the latest with the included CD and through gigabyte's web site.<br /><br />Some problems I encountered:<br />* I'm using the onboard video card (will get a discrete video card though) and it is pretty OK for the most part. I'm using it with Windows Media Center and it works fine at HD. BUT: my system won't boot up when I connect to my Samsung DLP using an HDMI cable. It would just sit there. If I use a VGA cable it works fine. I did a little search on the web and apparently this HDMI issue is not uncommon. I tried all sorts of things to make this work (updating firmware, changing the HDMI cable, trying different TV settings, BIOS options, etc). Long story short, finally what I did was connect the HDMI cable and the VGA cable to the DLP TV at the same time and it now boots up! I just cloned the displays in Windows so now everything is fine.<br />* Memory was not identified at 1600mhz automatically, had to manually set it. Not a biggy.<br />* I connected 4 HDDs (just like in my older system), but one of them was very slow when connected. Not sure what the issue is there. That HDD works fine when connected to my laptop. I tried connecting the different SATA ports with no success. That HDD (western digital) and the gigabyte MB don't seem to get along.<br /><br />It's been very time consuming trying to troubleshoot these problems. I was hoping to just swap out my old system and swap in this system, but perhaps that was asking for too much. I feel bad giving 3 stars, but I can't ignore the issues I had to deal with. 3.5 stars would be more fair but amazon doesn't have that option.
B001KPK6Q2|3.0|Only spent $2.99 on it, and I'd venture to say that was just the right price. Don't love her music, but my 6 year old does.
B001AG52AG|3.0|The movie was fine I just did not like the streaming. It did not stream correctly. It keep losing the streaming connection and I had to literally push play again to restart the movie.
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|My son plays it nearly every day going to and from school...... His mother wanted it because it has decent songs.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|The author rates himself much more highly than I ever could (or would).  I'm sure he's done some amazing things; I just don't enjoy reading about them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is the best!!!! My friend showed me this game and I instantly went crazy for it! It's so much fun and so addicting! You HAVE to buy Flow!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I gave this a four star rating, I do this with my Grandkids (it keeps us connected as they live several states away.  Not being very artistic, it is easy to use.
B004MPESSY|3.0|I like this movie, it is undeniably one of the best films made. It is a cult classic that got reworked but the streaming of this movie was terrible. It would stop right in the middle of the movie and cut off. I would have to hit the play button again to start the movie over and it did not even restart where it left off. I had to fast forward the movie to the part where it left off.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I turned this video off after watching half of it and went to write a review.  I saw so many positive reviews that I was thinking I must have watched a different story.  Curious, I went back and watched the rest of it, and the second half was much better than the first.  It's not a bad way to kill a couple of hours.  Most of it I considered mediocre - the plot, the dialogue, the acting - but the action in the second half saved this movie from being a total dud.  The younger set might enjoy it more.
B0009U5DD0|5.0|All of the songs on this recording are awesome. Great listening fun for a road trip for the intire family.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Always looking for something to challenge  the 'ole brain, and thought I was losing it spatially until I played FLOW FREE.  The first games were so super easy, that I quickly regained my confidence and even became bored; but the challenge did come.  Nice straight-forward game to pass the time with enough challenge to keep one engaged.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Love the game but takes for ever to get energy to keep going.  Would be nicer if u got 5 energy every 3 mins.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|omg this app is great but I cant download it and that's. bad<br />I really want to get this app its really to bad
B00519YRH2|5.0|This movie has been watched by myself for many times, it is hilarious !!!!  A GREAT family movie, don't hesitate to watch and/or buy.
030758836X|5.0|I have read Sharp Objects, and read Gone Girl immediately after, and am now in the middle of Dark Places, all are superb books but Gone Girl is where I feel Gillian Flynn has finally done it perfectly, written the perfect book, Flynn's first two books i reccomend as well but was left blown away after I read Gone Girl, it was one of the best books I have read in my life....
B006645CFM|5.0|I am a Rolling Stones fan.  I bought the delux edition strictly for the new songs.  Songs 1 through 10 have all been great since 1978, it is the new songs I was interested in.  I really enjoyed them.  They were all good grooves and the Hank Williams cover of &#34;You Win Again&#34; was excellent.  I would really like to see the Stones do a country album.  Back to the review.  &#34;Some Girls&#34; is a classic Stones album that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in listening to the Stones for the first time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very well written and intriguing. Couldn't guess the plot. There was suspense high throughout book. An excellent read. I am fan of thrillers....this is one of the best.
0374275637|5.0|The discussion on the importance of the subconscious mind in everyday life has been going on since Freud, Jung, and Adler; and Kahneman's book provides up to date insights on this puzzle of human existence.  He has provided many provocative reviews of experimental studies that have been carried out to discover the impact of our subconscious on our day to day decisions.  I found the book well worth the effort of reading and now have a new resource for information on the workings of the brain.<br /><br />A few segments of the book deal with probability and statistics in support of the assumptions arrived at, and a back ground in these areas would make these parts easier to comprehend.  Other than that I found little to fault in the presentation of the information so that it can clearly be understood and appreciated. Would definitely recommend this book for those interested in the workings of human thought.
B0012NO4WO|5.0|Love this movie.  Exciting, keep you interested and is a great movie to watch..  But it and you will not be sorry.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is so addicting you can play for hours and it doesn't get boring. I would highly recommend you getting this app!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Had to read it to complete the story. Hard to put down bet a little bit too similar to the others.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|cute game for kids.  very easy .  I had it for my five year old and it was too simple. nice game tho for learning.
B004NELBPC|3.0|The content is great!  The app still needs some work though.  You can only move the sections when you first configure the app.  If you decide you want to change the sections order again, you have to force stop and clear all data and start over with the configuration.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I  really  like this book because  it is super funny, and your still reading at the same time . - Veronica
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have two girls and they love My Little Pony. They were very excited when we downloaded the game! we are enjoying building our very own Ponyville! We recommend this game to everyone!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Had to read it to see what happened between them. Quite captivating even though you know where it's going and what's going to happen.
B005SZAEYO|5.0|I really enjoyed the pilot of this show.  I didn't expect it to be so good!  Nice way to spend my Sunday afternoon, and can't wait to see additional episodes.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This Facebook app only shows about the first 10 status updates.  Once you try to go beyond the first 10 status updates, the app stops working.  Much easier to just use the mobile Facebook site on the web.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|with an unopened dvd,  it got here on time and in good shapehis his purchase.  I was very pleased with t
B004GYY714|5.0|This is so handy when bored with all the other media.<br /><br />I love the variety and convenience.  Especially great when traveling.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|Couldn't put it down - just had to carry on reading. You really feel the depth of the love in the characters.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I was quickly enchanted and went through the entire collection totally enthralled.  It is addictive and so entertaining! One of the best!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I've never played Angry Birds, but am a huge Star Wars fan.  This game is so much fun and incorporates the Star Wars lore seamlessly and with great humor!  Very addicting!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is extremely fun and is super addictive! Just give me this game and some music and im good for hours on end!!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is filled with joy and really places before each reader a whole new perspective on every day life.
B009LRE040|3.0|IT had it moments, but there were moments when it felt the movie just..dragged on. I think the story needed a little more work before it got filmed.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|If you read the book you'll definitely not like this. I know, another person who doesn't like the movie adaptation of a book but even on a strictly movie basis it was pretty bad. The movie had a basic introduction, just enough to get a person to understand the premise, but not enough for anyone to empathizes with any character.<br />Basically, it was an action movie with just enough story to break up each fighting sequence to ensure that the entire movie wasn't one long battle. Some of the fight scenes were adequate, don't get me wrong, but there was a lot more that could have been done. The entire affair fell short of nearly any redeemable value.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|awful, full of plot holes and forced-dialogue to explain things so you dont feel completely lost.  AWFUL movie and i absolutely LOVED the previous Batmans
B00AMBMF1Y|4.0|Can't go wrong with a Clint Eastwood flick! Can't go wrong with a Clint Eastwood flick! Can't go wrong with a Clint Eastwood flick!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have seen.  Very funny and emotional.  Love the ending.  Good acting.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is the best show on TV  I have enjoyed every minute of every day watching it I just can't get enough of it.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Ok, it's a little shallow, but a fun movie.  Great for a group for movie night because you don't have to worry about following a plot.  But Johnny Depp is always fun.
0553381709|5.0|. . . I didn't dare buy #4 and #5 because it's too close to Christmas!  But I so wanted to so I can see what happens next!  Wow!  A lot of characters won't be in the next book . . .
B009H5IS1W|5.0|this is my favorite show on tv, the only one I watch.  the viewing was easy and great quality and was instantaneous
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always a good way to pass the time.  Can do anywhere.  Each game has its own way of winning.  You just have to figure it out.
B00962341U|5.0|This is a two disc set the first disc is the UK album release and the second disc is bonus songs and acoustic tracks.  I have to say from first listen I was completely engaged.<br /><br />Highlights: Un Love Me, Favorite Scar, When It Hurts, Come Alive, Glassheart, Fireflies, Trouble, Stop The Clocks, Lovebird, and the 80's sounding Shake You Up.
B009L32R5I|4.0|I used to have everything that Genesis put out, including all the side projects of Hackett,Gabriel,et al. One issue I had with their early albums was the sound quality. It sounded muddy to me, like someone threw a blanket over the microphones. I listened to other artists at the time who found ways to make thier recordings cleaner, crisper. NOW, with this recording, it sounds clean...this is on my 'want' list.
B005XI9456|5.0|Great price. My favorite song is Christmas Eve. Best song on the album.I think everyone should listen to it at least once
B008BO61BE|5.0|This CD sounds just as good today ad it did  30 years ago. The DVD should of been released years ago. This is Judas Priest at the top of their game. Must get for any metal fan.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I was expecting something a bit more fast-paced & thrilling.  I'm glad I waited for the opportunity to rent this movie as opposed to paying to see it in the theater.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I cannot wait for he next book.  This storyline was exciting and so different from the books I normally read.  Now, I must see the move!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Ted was one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. There I'd nothing better then a swearing teddy bear. Love it!!!!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was by far one of the most heartfelt and moving books I've ever had the honor of reading. Being one of God's children, it reminded me of the unconditional love, and how none of us are ever alone......even when certain circumstances and the devil make us feel that way. God Bless you and your family Dr. Eben Alexander lll.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|this movie was great, really enjoyed it  I had no problems with it and the picture quality was very good.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The best show on tv by far. The only show I watch live instead of recording. Season 3 is the best season so far.
1451695195|5.0|If you have ever had doubts about the afterlife, this book will help you understand better.<br />It's a great story and and easy read. It helps to put your mind at ease.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This game is like no other. I've played it through a couple of times now, and each time is a little different, especially if you pick up a \\"friend,\\" a playing partner, along the way. I've played with other regular players and also a white robe. The graphics are stunning, very artistic, and the game play is simple, but it's a lovely, meditative game rather than a shoot-em-up. I hope so much that ThatGameCompany is working on Journey 2! I think you could play this game many times and not get bored with it. When you play, if you let the credits roll, at the end you can see the online names of the companions you met along the way, which is also cool. Really a work of art.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|How many more times could James use the word murmur??<br />Over all. Liked the book- page turner but totally unbelievable!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is THE go-to weather app! Better than local weather guys. If you could integrate a drill down to live weather or traffic cam's it would rule!
B008D28HYS|4.0|This game is great.  I have really enjoyed it.  I wish there was a hint button.  But it is fun.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|We were fans of the first two movies but this one just didn't work well. The acting was inconsistent -- especially from Christian Bale. He is supposed to be injured and having trouble walking -- (he can barely get out of his car) then he twirls around the dance floor as if nothing were wrong -- only to limp again (and use a walking stick) later. Bruce Wayne doesn't have any emotional depth to him -- the moments he seems more . . . \\"involved\\" in what's happening and effected, come off as cheesy.<br /><br />It's good when a movie surprises you. This one doesn't have twists so much as it seems twisted. Really the story just seemed to be a backdrop for the special effects --- so the choppiness makes sense in a way.<br /><br />This is a visually appealing move with lots of action that still manages to be boring at times.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|All in all a good movie.  I would give a 3.5 but not a 4.  Thus my reason for settling on a 3.  I would recommend this for you science fiction addicts.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|My classmates became jealous of this backpack. Well constructed, affordable, nice internal organization, very secure, i think the best option in the market.  I have a pentax k5 with the external flahs, a telephoto 300, a macro 70 mm, and a couple more and everything is on its place, no mess
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My 10yr old daughter and I love adventure games and this was a great one for us.  It took a little effort to understand the rules the first time we played but we were able to get the hang of it.  We did not seem to have the problems others wrote about concerning the board coming apart.  It worked great and we love playing!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I purchased this after reading all the positive reviews. I like how I can see how much battery usage I have remaining on my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I love all the information that is available when using my Fire for various activities such as watching movies and listening to music. This is so helpful in knowing when to recharge, especially when traveling.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I would recommend this book. Some parts of the story were difficult to read due to the content but it is a touching story.
0307949508|5.0|This book is excellent, a can't-put-down kind of book. I purchased this because I had two of the books on hand and needed this to complete the story. An excellent read throughout.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|The original was better.  I love these actors but was not thrilled with this movie.  Not much plot, and the plot that was there was a bit confusing at times.
B007FY9ZWI|4.0|Does what it claims with out too much advertising like Angry Birds. Brings up the album covers (sorry , mp3 jpg) when song played.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Refreshing that this book says what we are thinking. Live, live a life that leaves scars and don't be afraid to be the grenade.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I liked the story line and of course the comedy that went with itl<br /><br />I liked the story line and the comedy that went with it. It really brought out the belly laughs for mel
B0098460O4|5.0|The quality of sound is excellent and the price is not bad at all. Finally, I have a copy of their CD. Love their music!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|For someone who did not grow up on the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, I am not qualified to compare this movie to any other films, tv shows, or books about this wonderful character. I can say that I think Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law make up the pefect team of smarts, wits and just a dash of insanity. As soon as you think you've figured out what all is going on, there will be another twist or new piece to the puzzle added. I highly, highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves mystery, action and more comedy than what you would expect.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game relaxes you..I play it in all my free time. And kinnda to say its addictive ...fun but very addictive.I recommend it to any one out there;)
B0015DROBO|4.0|I read this because I needed to read a Swedish book for a social studies class, that being said I might be a high school student, but I avoid teen literature generally. Since then, I've read the full trilogy. Honestly, I'd say read this one, and ignore the others.<br />This book is packed with surprises, and plot twists that leave you shocked, along with striking imagery. It takes a while to get going, but once it does, you don't want to stop.<br />Once again though, avoid the squeals.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book until the end. I thought it should have been a little more dramatic. I hope there is a second book
B0066WJLU6|4.0|The flashilight makes great use of the camera flash on my phone.  Just what I needed for seeing in a dark house.
0738727326|5.0|I absolutely love this tarot deck. Beautiful, detailed, and worth the price I paid. I'd recommend it to any of my friends.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game super fun cant stop playing it its the best I have NO problems with it I recommend it to everyone
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is an easy read story that demands that you finish the book. In a certain sense the outcome is predictable, but there is a surprise ending, which makes it worthwhile finishing the book. There two ways of looking at the story: on the one hand it is gruesome and abhorrent, but if you look at it as a war story, which it in a certain sense is, then it is just like any other war story in which people suffer and get killed. This is possibly the best way of approaching it. Well written, but certainly not a literary masterpiece. It was obviously written as the first of a series of books, that it is. It is not recommended for sensitive readers and I would not recommend it to people who have emotional problems. If you are looking for something to cheer you up, don't read it. Although I would like to know what happens next, I don't think that I will read the other books. The reason why I read this one was to find out what it is all about since I had heard so much about it. Now I know and I know enough and don't need to know more.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I'm really lazy and I don't feel like going out and finding the stuff on my own. this game helps a lot.I made a house out of bedrock and people were amazed by it because u cant harvest bedrock. this is amazing
B008KE3960|4.0|Got this app for kindle fire. It runs very well and play it with my grandson he loves it when we load up on plains and go into high speed. Lots of fun.
B0057ZEMF2|5.0|The combination of the inspired sitar playing and the bold flamenco/Spanish numbers, including the cante jondo, make of this record a welcome addition to my record library.  Beautiful and haunting throughout.  Bravo.
1451695195|5.0|Great book, received it as a Christmas present.  It is a very uplifting book.  I read it in 2 days and will now pass it to my wife.  It is spiritual and scientific.
1567184855|5.0|If anybody is looking for meaning of this life and the life after, this book and his next one &#34; Destiny of Soul&#34; would clearly be the best unbiased source that I came across.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|It's a good premise, two guys helping a stranded alien get away. Naturally they had to throw in stereo-typical unthinking thug-like security guards and semi-illiterate Bible-belt trailer trash, though I enjoyed the girl's transformation into regular trailer trash. In the end, the &#34;twist&#34; wasn't a total surprise, but I was glad it happened that way.<br /><br />The main actors, I thought, played their parts well, despite what I thought was dodgy dialog. I had never heard of anyone who could drive NOT being able to drive an RV. Doesn't it still have the same controls as a car? Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way. I guess he was just &#34;uncomfortable&#34; behind the wheel of something so large.
B005K15XR4|4.0|This music is not only inspirational but motivating. Originally bought it for bodybuilding posing music, now I also use ut for working out.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Good movie....I thought there would of been more funnier than it was being that is all people talked about for 6 months.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Like spending time with an old, dear friend. Great read for an old fan or a new reader to the series.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|For over 60 years I'd heard the story, I'd seen the play, I'd watched the movies - all of them (I like the George C. Scott one the best), but I had never read the book. I was not the least disappointed with the book. It had just enough back-story that didn't come across on stage or screen to make it new and still the same wonderful story.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Mostly about sex, farts and other things that are boldly un-PC. Hate to admit that it made me laugh. A couple of touching moments.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|we wonder how we survive the good old days as we watch a shyster convert to an average person, one
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The third wheel is a very hilarious book . Gregory heffley is great character. He's practically kind of like me .
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|Billy Wilder is a comedy genius. I didn't think this could live up to Some Like It Hot but it did. Jack Lemmon gives an excellent performance and leaves you wanting more. Shrilly MacLaine didn't do so bad either!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Not a bad movie, but I'mglad the wife and I didn't spend $30 (with popcorn) to see it.  Definately a rental.
B001IWUZYK|5.0|this is the musical version is just as enjoyable as the movie though different, and I need six more words
B00742LLKU|4.0|This compilation contains a lot of great performances at a great price.  But, many of Debussy's mot popular works were written for piano and orchestrated by others.  Both version are equally valid but we get only one of each.  Thus, Petite Suite, Children's Corner, and Suite Bergamasque appear only in their piano versions while Tarentelle Styrienne, La Boite a Joujoux, and Khamma appear only in their orchestrated versions.  There are four CDs of songs in this collection; I would gladly give up a song CD for these missing works.  Nonetheless, I certainly recommend this for everything that's right with this set.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Mysterious, captivating and elegant. This, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, and Vertigo are my top Hitchcock films. This is one classic worth owning and watching more than once.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Entire family a Bones series fan.  We try and guess Who Did It.  Witty and funny.  We have all the seasons so far.
0470901071|4.0|I have the 5th, 6th, and recently purchased the 7th. Based on the number of editions I own, it should be an indicator as to how long I've procrastinated to actually study and finally get certified, but I have done it. Needless to say, I've only thoroughly read a third of the 6th and read the 7th thoroughly from start to finish. Just like with any study material, depending on the style of writing, it may have certain limitations, strengths and or weaknesses. I will do my best to highlight what I believe this book does well and perhaps what it could improve on. Also, note that if you have the ability to purchase a second book (i.e. the Cisco press certification library), I personally believe it will help in filling in any gaps in material not thoroughly covered by this book.<br /><br />Strengths:<br />1 book stop shop to cover all CCNA (640-802) exam objectives; all chapters are organized in sequence to where you can literally read from the beginning to end, without having to jump around. If your goal and objective is to take one test and become certified in one shot, this book is a must have as its tailored, organized, around that one test, although it does cover the material in both the ICND-1 and ICND-2.<br /><br />A relatively \\"short\\" read for a book covering so many topics. This is one of those intangibles that could be really helpful for believing that getting through the book is really doable. Sometimes a really thick book or in some cases a pair of thick books can seem very intimidating as you think of how long it will take to get through them.<br /><br />Chapters covering fundamental material such as Internetworking, Ethernet, as well as the OSI layers & TCP/IP, is covered in well and in depth needed for the exam and just in general for real world networking<br /><br />Chapters for IP addressing and Subnetting: Probably the strongest and the most valuable content of the book and what sets this book and Mr. Lammle apart. The techniques and shortcuts on memorizing certain things to help you subnet in your head quickly. I use these methods today on a regular basis. Its the BEST method I have found for subnetting and  it simply works. The subnetting material in this book alone is worth purchasing the book.<br /><br />Wireless chapter and ipv6.<br /><br />Written and Lab exercises at end of chapters to ensure you grasp the material. Hands-on practice, for most, really help solidify the information and Todd does a good job of including Lab exercises for most chapters<br /><br />You will learn from this book that Lammle likes to be brief and and not over complicate any topic. He explains most topics as in they are easy and straight forward. In reality, most things are pretty easy and straight forward<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />Frame-relay I felt was not covered very well nor was it explained very well. For example regarding DLCI addressing. Yes, DLCI's are always only locally significant but it didn't go into the examples of local vs global and how do decipher what addressing is used if you are viewing a diagram and its not specified, etc. As well as it left out examples of multipoint interface configurations and different frame-relay topologies. Basically, to me, this chapter left me with more questions coming out of it than going into it.<br /><br />As some have said, the writing style of this book is of the conversational type, which is fine when reading from start to finish but it makes it difficult to quickly reference information you may want to retouch on later on, because you have to sort through sentences and and sentences at times to find specifically something you are looking for, such as a specific command, which could be like finding a needle in a haystack<br /><br />The outputs from cli are sort of bunched in between through the chapters and not organized as well. Again, I found it difficult having to reference material previously read. Sometimes certain material could seem scattered and not as well organized as it could have been.<br /><br />Overall the book delivers, and I as I mentioned the subnetting material in the book is gold and makes it worth the purchase alone, but I strongly recommend to not rely on only one source for preparation of the exam. There may be certain topics and subjects that one author or instructor may know how to communicate better than others and vice versa. And their style of writing, drawing diagrams and charts/tables may resonate more with one person than another.<br /><br />Final word on preparation for the exam: If you really want to go in there and pass the test with flying colors, I suggest using one primary book for your studies, and one back-up to aid after you have finished reading this book. Then after you are finished, figure out what areas you feel least comfortable in and attack those aggressively; watch videos on the subjects (tons of free stuff on youtube etc), spend extra lab time (hands-on) on those topics, and with precision, tailor and design your studies to suit what you feel is needed for yourself; read more on those specific topics you feel you did not grasp very well, whether it be because you just didn't get it or felt the book didn't cover enough for you to get it. If you put the work in, you will pass the exam, this applies to whatever book you chose to use for your studies. It's very important you put the time in with hands-on exercises and practice as much as possible, this will solidify all the stuff you read and hear about.
B008GM1FPI|5.0|This film has a lot to share about what we think is reality, and that reality is just a dream that we are living even when we think we are awake. Lots of wisdom here.
6305161879|5.0|This is not only only one of the best comedies I've seen, but one of the best movies in general. It's one of those movies where you can watch it for the fifteenth time and still laugh as hard as you did the first time.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|This is the absolute worst recording of Les Miserables I've ever heard. Jackman and Crowe destroyed their roles of Valjean and Javert. There are a few redeaming parts of the recording - Samantha Barks for the most part. For the casual fan of Les Miserables, I recommend The Tenth Anniversary Recording. That has voice quality and star power.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this series! Jessica Lang is so awesome, she has got some mad acting skills. Can't wait to see the other episodes
B008MM9630|4.0|Just started playing, enjoying so far and will continue playing.  Does offer in game purchases and package deals. Plant, harvest, quests, etc.
B005LAIGSM|1.0|Same as above.....charges were astronomical......wish we had never gotten involved with the purchase of these movies.  Thought it a great idea until I discovered that my &#34;shipping free&#34; did not apply.  When I tried to cancel, I found that each order of movies was not on one order but many and therefore, my credit card reflects over a hundred dollars.  Not worth it.  Never again....
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great storyline and really fun to watch. While it has some dramatic elements, it is more of a comedy. You must start from episode 1.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Better than I expected.Lots of different styles.Not crazy about the duet however.Liked the change in style;could be a little more country.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I love Brandon Sanderson.  He is, definitively my favorite author.  This book was set in the world of Elantris (my favorite book) and it is well done, and very well written.  I've read most of Sanderson's work (all of it good!) and this was just as well done.  That being said, there was a lot of potential to this story that I think could have expanded it it to stand alone as a novel.  Then again, I feel that way about most of his novellas.  I only give it 4 stars because I was disappointed there wasn't more.  That being said, I thought it was a good read, I enjoyed it, and I look forward to whatever he comes out with next!
1451695195|5.0|a remarkably fine perspective...science!<br />Reassuring...and a great read!<br /><br />THANKS to GOD for this beautiful sharing.<br /><br />Life everlasting is not a myth!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Shock Humor. With many moments that were way over the top. When the topic wasnt funny, it made it really awkward to watch. Less random, however, than family guy.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|A good look into an interesting dark world of Gotham animated but not for children the action in this movie brutal yet fun
B000QCS8TW|3.0|It was a fair read, as epics go, but I don't really get what has so many people going crazy about it.  It certainly wasn't interesting enough for me to purchase any of the other books in this series.  Maybe the show is better, I don't watch TV so I don't know.  Again, it's okay, but it isn't something I care to pursue, especially when I compare it to other epics like those written by Brandon Sanderson.
B009ZE27US|1.0|this game scanner thing sucks it wont get your age right no matter how many times you try I don't like it.
0156027321|3.0|Well written for the most part, but could have benefited from some judicious editing.<br />A few whole chapters in fact. Still Life of Pi is good read.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is an excellent chance to escape from reality for a little while. It's full of adventure, mystery, and excitement. Riggs is an imaginative writer and this is a very easy read- I completed it in one day while on vacation. Highly recommended, I can't wait for the sequel!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This is a very fun  app and I love it. At first it is very easy and stuff but at the sencond level it is very hard. Merry Christmas!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My children enjoy this movie, saw it in theaters and are now wearing out the disc.  They find it very funny and it is an age-appropriate mopvie for 9 & 10 year olds.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Many people complain about the lack of refined quality of this soundtrack. And all I can say is, that is the point. That is the beauty of recording the songs during scene recording.<br /><br />I've seen the film already and the music is incredibly powerful. And I will admit that the experience of the soundtrack is NOWHERE near the same as watching the movie with it.<br /><br />So a tip for EVERYONE: SEE the film. Don't criticize the skill of the actors in singing. See the film. It's almost lifechanging, I promise.<br /><br />After seeing the movie you will look at the lyrics differently, you will hear the soundtrack differently, honestly. It's a work of art.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American Horror Story is at an all time high!!!  This season is even better than season 1.  It was great to  be able to watch it from my computer at my leisure.  Thank you.
B009ZE27US|1.0|do not get this app it is terrible and never works it said I was 42 I'm no where near that
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|It's amusing but, not as funny as I was expecting.  I am glad I didn't see this at the theater.
1451695195|5.0|The book was good and it came on time & in good condition. A quick read. If you have lost someone this book is encouraging.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I saw the first book movie when it came out and was told that the book had more to it so I read it and was pleased that it did include more.  I downloaded the second book and read it in three days and then downloaded this final version which I read in two days.  Just could not put it down it was that good.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have this game on my iphone and now my kindle fire hd, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing solitaire. :)
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Ok, I bought this because its Star Wars and Angry Birds put together. I am a fan of one, the other, not so much. Its enjoyable to see how they amalgamated the two worlds. What isn't fun is when they want you shell out an extra two bucks to play all of the levels. When I drop money for a game, I want the whole game. I know, its a strange concept, but apparently I'm not the only one thinking it.
1401917186|3.0|I'm sure that for many who have felt \\"out of place\\", to some extent, can benefit from this book.  As humans, we do tend to find comfort in labels for ourselves for some reason.  However, I personally don't really find it as something that really is going to help a person grow.  I mean, in all honesty, how can saying \\"Hey I'm an incarnated angel!\\" really truly help someone?  There's a lot of different personality and categorizing systems out there in psychology and in more psycho-spirituality, but what does it really help?  The goal, in my mind, is to develop more intuitively and to discover yourself internally rather than create labels for it.  To some extent, I can see a bit of understanding and comfort in the label but after the discovery... what changes?  Anything?<br /><br />I do like Doreen's books, workshops, and other information.  Yet, I must say what I have find most helpful is her information on intuitive development and connecting to your Angels.  Some of these other books, I feel, are like a toned down additional material that really doesn't amount to much.<br /><br />Perhaps part of my opinion stems from not really finding a category that fully \\"gels\\" with me.  I guess the one I most related to was incarnated angels, but I tend to be rather independent, quiet, and detached at times... which I could see going along with starpeople, possibly... but I could also see that as simply being a nurture aspect (due to my upbringing... as recognized in traditional psychology) rather than a spiritual aspect.  That being said, I've read of other systems that are more spiritual based that, though were perhaps a bit more \\"out there\\" (like saying what planet(s) you lived at previously) that gelled with me more.  However, as I said earlier, even though the \\"label\\" gelled with me it's not like it was any real significant information that I really needed to know in order to grow.  It was more like a \\"oh that's nice\\" and carry on learning and growing with more proactive things.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Excellent collection; all the hits; great price.  I would recommend to any Creedence Clearwater Revival fans. A good purchase.  I'll keep my eye open for more.
B00006RCOB|3.0|it was a little slow for a clint eastwood movie , but it did pick up some excitement later in the movie
B00003CXAW|4.0|Peter Jackson did a excellent job restoring this as close to the origional as possible. The back stoirie were very imteresting.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I've enjoyed playing Mahjong on my new Kindle.  It is fun and challenging trying to find pieces that match.  I like the different pictures on the tiles - it is a little more challenging than others I've played.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|five stars for Emmy Rossum, for sure, what a lovely brilliant singing performance she gives us in this great adaption of the play, which i've seen a handful of times at the Kennedy Center in Was DC. Gerard did a nice job too as the Phantom, a tall, charming, yet troubled and sad \\"Phantom\\".  I thought they had good chemistry, and the rest of the cast was well done. Minnie Driver, a comedic addition as her character brought some laughs, great job Minnie !<br /><br />Everyone will have different views as far as who was cast, who sings better, etc. But I really enjoyed this actually kind of long movie, its just over 2 hrs and 10 minutes, but the music is great, their singing is very good and at times tearful when you really listen to what they are singing and their plight with their different places in the story.<br /><br />If you like the original Play at all, I really think you will enjoy this film too. and for $5 or even the 2 disc special edition which i wish i had, is only around $11 which has bonus features, thats even less than a movie ticket, and you get to watch the DVD over and over.  just really a good buy !
B006KX3GXO|1.0|The app does allow me to take pictures yet, however I turn the device I'm always upside down. There's no correction for that either. I thought perhaps if I shut off the locking landscape it would change and that didn't work. I then did a shutdown and restart and that also didn't work.<br /><br />Very disappointed as it seems to have some really neat features. If I want to stare at myself upside down it'd be awesome.
0440228921|5.0|I didn't like a big giant annoying price tag right on the book cover (not a sticker but part of the cover.) It's kind of tacky but it's worth it for the price of this book. This book is amazing... a must read for all ages.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the ease of use, especially foran older person who is not technically savvy.  I would re.ccomend it for anyone
B00992CF6W|5.0|It has very few if any flaws. Its not fully updated yet though. Great game on all of its platforms.
1451662432|5.0|Very interesting book and went through it fast.  It also made a good gift to others, not just into Arnold, but into the story of self made people
B001C3KCSY|4.0|I came across this band by chance, and I have taken quite a liking to their music.  I review this album, Only By The Night, because it is the one I have heard the most of... I am still discovering their other albums. Kings of Leon is a band of brothers and cousins; the entire Followhill clan.  Their lead singer, Caleb Followill, provides the incredible vocals with passion and angst... his vocals carry the songs to your soul.  Their music is sometimes alternative rock, sometimes gritty guitar rock, and sometimes techno-synth rock, but always classic and passionate.  My favorite song of this album is \\"Closer\\".  Overcoming the tragic death of their guitarist, Nathan Followhill, Kings of Leon continues to make great music.  If you like this album, I also recommend Come Around Sundown, which features another great song, \\"The End.\\"
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Good read. Funny, heartwarming, and tragic all in one. The relationship between Gus and Hazel feels real, like you're sitting right across from them watching them grow as a couple.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|The main theme of this film is \\"the power of forgiveness.\\"  Now, I myself don't necessarily buy into this oversimplified concept myself, at least in real life.  After all, I don't know how forgiving I would be if I were tried and convicted of a crime that I hadn't committed, and then hanged for it.  Just sayin'.<br /><br />Not to be too cynical, but that's not the point of the film, of course.  The point is, if someone in Hollywood wants to make a film - supposedly for a younger audience - that filmmaker must make a film that has some nice little Hallmark message inside.  And \\"Paranorman\\" surely provides that message, buy it or not, and so therefore, it becomes palatable for sugarcoated American audiences that are always craving for something overly sweet.<br /><br />Am I complaining, you might be tempted to ask?  Well, I'm probably complaining more about American audiences than the film.  After all, it is American audiences that drive filmmaking which creates movies such as this.  So I think that you need to remember this before going in to this seemingly Rudolph-inspired film.  You've got the outcast youngster, bullied because he's different:  that would be Norman instead of Rudolph.  You've got the love interest doe:  the young girl aluded to in the first paragraph (but I can't remember her name) instead of Clarice.  And you've got the bullies:  plenty of those to go around in both movies.<br /><br />And you just know going in that the bullied kid will make good at the end.  Yes, this film might be just viewed as a retread of so many other kids movies with basically the same plot line, and to a degree that's true.  But it is repackaged in a pretty funny way, ala \\"Sixth Sense\\" style I guess.  This time with ghosts that aren't really so scary.  They were just scared themselves, at least when they were human.<br /><br />I did like this film, with a few caveats, as I have discussed.  So I will give this a mild recommendation.  Oh, and please forgive me in advance ifI'm wrong.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Best show ever<br />Get it while u can. Y y y y y y y y y y y h
B00992CF6W|3.0|i think you people who made the game should bring the price lower because my friend has minecraft but she got it for free on her ipod and on kindle fires they put the price as 6.99$ i dont think its fair.  pleez fix it. :(
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm addicted.  Can't keep my kindle charged from playing it.  I am finally figuring out how to get it to hit where I want it to.

0756666937|5.0|New book, recieved as promised.  The book was a gift for my grandson.  He loved it and I loved the price.
B005DI66N4|4.0|This book was enlightening on the conditions in the USSR, and made me count my blessings again for having been born in the USA.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|It is a good show lots of drama and action. All the actors do a really good bringing the show true to life. Very good I recommend watching the series. Looking foreword to the new season
B004T4LUPW|1.0|All Amazon apps are spy ware. I'm getting rid of them all! Amazon has failed me. I bought the real up to date version of calengoo from play.
B009YMYI2Q|4.0|This isn't an intelligent film, but it is a simple action film told in a very fun way. You cannot get more simple than an estranged  father, trying NOT to be estranged, while everyone else; ex wife, daughter and ex wife's new husband, doing everything in their power to keep him estranged, and then showing this man on the outside being the ONLY one who can save the daughter after she is kidnapped and is about to be sold into the sex trade. He does everything he can do to find his unappreciative spoiled, but missing daughter. More importantly, he has a special set of skills that are useful in tracking and killing anyone who gets in the way of him finding his daughter. Now, add Liam Neeson and martial arts, and you have a high octane mix ready to blow you away.  There is no deep thoughts here...no mystery, no thriller twists, just a hard hammered fist of a man plowing through people, trying to find his little girl.  As the father of a little girl, I loved it. I would have loved it anyway, because, I love anything with Liam Neeson.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Would buy from this seller again! A+++++++++++++++++. Very  interesting to read someone's perspective after spending time in a concentration camp.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Slow plot that plays slow. Needs better graphics and more instruction. Kept deploying metals without knowing I was.  They could improve it and I think I would play it more.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I love to read John Grisham and James Patterson books.  I just don't have enough time to read them fast enough.  Will comment as I read the books.  The Litigators is a great book.
B009E3EY38|2.0|i know live cd's are a risk, but led zep needs to go back and practice their music and get better sound managers.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Great characters and a really fun story. I asked a friend for recommendations for a great book to read based on my intrests in the supernatural, drama, and love stories and this book really delivered. I love books with strong female leads and this author really knows.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is addicting and fun. It worked great for a while, but then my kindle fire hd would completely shut down while playing it and I would have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds to restart my kindle....had to delete it from my device.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|How is Veronica Mars cancelled and Two and a Half Men on!? What is WRONG with people?  Now, I know I jumped the Veronica Mars train late in the game, but this show is AWESOME! The characters are fun and well defined, and the plot lines are intriguing.  The best thing about the show is a toss up between excellent writting and phenomenal actors.  Thats a great toss up to have.  I cannot believe that they only lasted three seasons.  I am a proud DVD owner of this series, I hope to find another like it someday.

B004UID2LC|3.0|I've gotten great use from this app, but twice now it has given me issues. The first time was a simple fix that had it back to being awesome in no time. Now, it force closes on me, saying I need to be logged in to use it. It doesn't give me an option to log in (which I never needed to do before) but instead it resets my phone. I tried an uninstall then reinstall but no dice. I'm very disappointed, because it works great. If it didn't give me hassle, it'd be 5 stars.

B009VB7QQA|2.0|When you do a vampire fantasy based in such a well-known historical context, the liberties taken with the history part should be more constrained. This work stretches your enjoyment of the fantasy by making too many distracting references to Lincoln and his time that are simply unbelievable, making it hard to join in the fantasy. Even the casting of Mary Todd was difficult to fathom, even if just for the fact that in reality she was about 2 feet shorter than Lincoln, and so even the scene where she stretches up a bit and Lincoln bends over (a bit) to have a kiss looked so odd. OK, it's a fantasy, but the train engine making headway uphill as the tracks crumble beneath it reminded me of the battleship being swung around in seconds on its anchor chain in &#34;Battleship.&#34; Just then, all relation to even the fantasy vanished, and it was laughable. But I'm still glad all the silver in town helped win the Battle of Gettysburg, and of course, who knew the evil vampires fought only on the side of the South. Geeze.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I would have given it a 5 if the action sequences were not so choppy and throughout the dialogue I found myself asking, &#34; what did they say and what does it mean?&#34;<br />I am glad the &#34;Legacy&#34; did not stop with Jason Bourne.<br />The extremism of this movie is awesome.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|For all that I've heard about this trilogy, the excerpt that I read was not \\"up to par\\", but rather dull.<br />The word \\"besieged\\" was used twice in one sentence - Has the author never heard of a thesarus?!<br />The dialogue between Ana and Mr Grey, at least at the beginning, is nothing to fawn over. If you can't<br />grab my attention at the start with lively characters, then I'm not going to get to the \\"good\\" parts!<br />I give the sample reading two stars because while the storyline has potential, it's just not that intriguing.

B007VDN1PA|5.0|I just sat down with my parents to review and digitize the 35mm slides from my Grandparent's collection, using this device.  Of the 1000's of slides that we reviewed, I captured almost 500 absolute gems of family pictures.  Being able to connect this device to the TV meant that we could review the slides as a group (before capturing them), to determine which pictures were worth keeping, as well as caucus to figure out \\"who was who\\" in some of those elusive baby pictures and young extended family member pictures!  The result was not only an absolute treasure trove of otherwise \\"lost\\" pictures that we can now share with many of those extended family members -- in addition, what a memorable experience I had, reviewing all these old family pictures with my Mom & Dad!<br /><br />Some technical things worth noting (from our experience).  We initially had lousy picture quality with our slides, until I found the setting on the device, specifically for slides. Once that was set - the photo quality was quite remarkable.  Admittedly, the picture quality was somewhat pixelated when reviewing the slides \\"live\\" on a high-def (HD) TV.  however, once the pictures were \\"captured\\" on the memory card, the \\"slideshow\\" from the device (using that same HD TV) was quite wonderful.  This may help to explain some of the other comments that I have read here regarding \\"poor picture quality\\" of slides.  Certainly, if the device isn't in the proper mode (for slides), and if you are looking at the \\"live\\" image from the slide before being captured - the picture quality was less than adequate.  HOWEVER, the image quality of the digitized pictures themselves, (when viewed in slideshow mode from the device, or on the computer after capture) was MORE than adequate.<br /><br />The one gripe that I had was the fact that some of the pictures on my grandfather's slides were larger than the viewable area within the device.  This caused me two problems:<br /> - Occasionally, I had slides for which there appeared to be no way to get the complete picture from the slide into one frame of a captured picture.  {See workaround below.}<br /> - Occasionally, I had a slide where the subject's head would get \\"cut off\\".  {See workaround below.}<br />For the first problem, I took two captures, one of the top half of the slide, and one of the bottom half.  I plan to stitch the two picture-half's together with a post-processing software package.  The second problem caused me to load the slide \\"up-side-down\\" and then use the device's \\"flip\\" feature to correct the inverted image.  This technique allowed me to hold the slide partially within the viewer to manually center the slide without the subject's head getting cut off for the capture.  I used a similar method to manually center the slide to keep from cutting off the subject's feet and better frame/center the picture on the slide, for the capture.<br /><br />Overall the quality was good enough that I plan to re-scan previously digitized pictures from my flatbed scanner with a \\"slide adapter\\".  While those images showed the content of the scanned slides, the quality was not near what I am getting with this device.  I am extremely happy with this product - well worth the minor investment.

1607066017|4.0|Vaughan is a master of great premises: \\"What if all but one man on earth suddenly died?\\" (Y: The Last Man) \\"What if a man who could talk to machines was elected as mayor of New York?\\" (Ex Machina) In Saga, there's no single premise; just a nonstop flood of interesting sci-fi ideas. A galactic war of magic vs. technology? Aristocratic robots? Celebrity bounty hunters? A planetary sex resort? Rayguns that incapacitate their targets with emotional pain? Spaceship trees? Vaughan is throwing everything and the kitchen sink into this sci-fi epic, and the feeling that anything can happen is a lot of fun. Plus, the art is excellent.<br /><br />It remains to be seen, though, whether the cast can become as interesting as the setting. Y: The Last Man is one of the all-time great comic book series because of the complex relationships that developed between Yorick, his protectors, and his pursuers. At the end of the first volume of Saga, the central couple feels underdeveloped. They're trying to find their happily-ever-after in a war-torn galaxy where pretty much everyone wants them dead. I'm willing to go along for that ride, but if Saga is going to realize its potential, they need to find more to do than fighting, running, and talking about how much they hate fighting and running.
1442355476|3.0|Published by Simon and Schuster in 2012<br />Read by Armand Schultz<br />Duration: Approximately 6 hours<br />Abridged<br /><br />In The Last Man, Vince Flynn takes a break from the Mitch Rapp prequels and puts Mitch right in the thick of the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. He is brought in to investigate the disappearance (a presumed home invasion kidnapping) of Joe Rickman, the head of the CIA's clandestine operations in Afghanistan. In fact, he's been involved in so many clandestine operations that he could singlehandedly gut the intelligence agency's efforts in multiple countries around the world.<br /><br />But, as Rapp and his team start to investigate they find that all of the pieces don't quite fit together. Add to that an FBI agent that believes that Rapp and Rickman have pocketed millions of dollars intended for intelligence efforts in Afghanistan and the reappearance of a deadly man from Rapp's past and you have the basis for a good story.<br /><br />While the action is solid, there is too much posturing by Rapp and probably too much taken out of this abridged edition of the book. It is 6 hours compared to 12 hours in the unabridged version and the story most likely suffers a lot. The abridged version gets the highlights ( Rapp shoots, fights, glowers, curses and throws righteous anger tantrums all over Afghanistan and Washington, D.C) but none of the stuff that makes those highlights a change from the norm (thus, a highlight). The accusation from the FBI agent comes off as cartoonish and the bad guy is so blatantly cruel that you have to wonder who would ever want to work with him (at one point he determines that he will have to kill a woman simply because she is ugly - not because she knows too much, but because she knows too much and she is too ugly). Rapp is badly injured in the story but  recovers so quickly that I wondered why the injury was even worked into the story line.<br /><br />So, my recommendation: spend a few more bucks and get the unabridged version of the audiobook. It will most likely be a better experience.<br /><br />Note: I was sent a copy of this audiobook by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.nabridged version of the audiobook.

B005QUQ99K|4.0|This set contains two minifigures and one bike.<br />The Kai minifigure is pretty decent, though not exceptionally good. One small complaint I have is that with this minifig, there is  a provision on the back of the minifig for keeping the swords and the slots provided for putting the sword was kind of thin and was bit difficult to fit the swords there.<br />The second minifig is Rattla, which is amazing!( LEGO has done a decent job with all the Serpentine minifigs). The design on this minifigs is nice, especially the one on the face. Even the design on the hood, which is a separate piece, is cool.<br />You get one Hynobrai-staff (snake weapon) in this set, which looks very good. This staff comes with a small stand-kind-of-thing which includes some flame and foliage pieces, which give a nice touch. (This staff and stand , when kept next to the \\"Venomari Shrine\\" set, looks amazing).<br />Coming to the blade-cycle, which is the main attraction of this set, is BEAUTIFUL!! Definitely , one of the best looking bikes from LEGO, beyond doubt. There is a small feature with this bike (You press one button and the blades open a bit). And this bike looks even better with the blades open! The only problem with this bike is that, it is not very durable. When I was assembling it, twice some pieces came out. So, when young kids will try to play a bit roughly with it (they always do), they might be a bit upset when the pieces come apart. But older kids and adults can and will definitely handle this bike better. It rolls/move very smoothly. But , like I said, needs to be handled with care.<br />One complaint I have with set (and almost all LEGO sets) is that it contains stickers! Smaller the stickers, bigger the problem. It's difficult to position the stickers right in the first attempt and by the time you get the postion right, the stickers would have got smudged at the ends. LEGO needs to come out with printed parts, which will look better and banish stickering forever!<br />Thisset, the bike especially, is definitely a MUST-HAVE for all LEGO NINJAGO fans or for those who like amazing-looking-bikes. I seriously wish LEGO would design similar bikes for the other three Ninjas ( Cole, Jay and Zane). It would look awesome..all the four bikes side-by-side!  Anyway, I'm definitely gonna buy some more of this set and create a small army of blade-bikes!

1451638450|3.0|I've been reading Bujold since her very first paperback, Shards of Honor, came out way back when. I've been a devoted fan of the Vorkosigan books ever since, and am myself now a published novelist for 20 years. I seldom write reviews because I know how much I dislike \\"negative\\" reviews (I don't check my own!) but in this case, I felt so sorely disappointed that I felt I had to give my own very contrary opinion.<br /><br />For me, this book really failed to live up to expectations. It stands among my least favorite in the saga, along with Cryoburn and the one about Mark (a character I never liked.) I have some of the same issues: in Cryoburn, there was too little of Miles and too much about characters I simply wasn't that interested in.<br /><br />It's not at all that I don't like Ivan. I love him. But I never felt he was even remotely the center of the story. Far more was about Tej and her family--a family I intensely disliked--and Ivan felt more like a secondary character along for the ride. I never developed any interest for Tej, who seemed like a placeholder female character to me, and while I thoroughly enjoyed Bujold's high developed worlds and cultures and the usual humorous byplay, I would have preferred much more about Ivan, much less about (to me) dull Tej and the (to me) unlikable Arquas.<br /><br />I doubt I'll buy Bujold's next book in hardcover, though I've been doing it for years. I am rather astonished that some have actually called this the or one of the best of her books; I'd class it in the lowest three. I wish the book had been what I longed for when I pre-ordered it ... a story about what I thought would be the central character. And this book also pointed out something I hadn't really realized before ... that while Bujold's male characters are always beautifully realized, her female characters tend to be undereveloped and feel rather lifeless.<br /><br />I really hope the next book in this series, if there is one, is more about Ivan.

B009SQRL4U|5.0|A cute and very funny piece.  Yes, it has some humor that appeals to adults (like the Bush-like announcement of \\"Mission Accomplished\\" after a not-altogether successful mission as well as a chihuahua that was \\"fond\\" of a fuzzy slipper), but my savvy 11-year-old did not make the connections, while I thought they were clever and funny.  Hey, old Looney Tunes had double-entendres, too.  I didn't get those when I was a kid, but when I see those old Looney Tunes now, I see the \\"adult\\" humor in them.  Oh, and in case you thought maybe I was \\"too permissive,\\" we don't watch films here that go over a G (notable exception is Harry Potter films, several of which are PG).<br /><br />Some reviewers also seem concerned that the wrong message comes through because \\"Steve\\" and Santa are not overly concerned about \\"one missed child.\\"  But the whole point of the story is that Arthur clearly has the true spirit of Christmas as he makes sure the child gets her gift.  In the process, he is able to restore that spirit to Steve and Santa (and everyone else).<br /><br />I say this is a good and funny film.  It is indeed a shame it didn't do better in the  US box office.  Definitely worth it.<br /><br />Oh, and now we know WHY one cannot see Santa's house at the North Pole on Google Earth.  Thanks, Gwen!!

B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie reminds me of silly teen movies I used to watch 10 years ago, only it has great music and the humor is marginally more adult.  But it definitely falls in the category of movies I would watch over and over and laugh at every single time.  The music is just gravy and actually very very good!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Although we know this story will end on a happy note it did take twists and turns before we got there.  It's a delightful girl's fantasy.
B003B02OOG|5.0|For fans of Grisham this book of short stories is quite insightful. I find myself wondering why some of these were not fleshed out into novels. Really enjoyed the comedic affect of Quiet Haven.
B008B11R2A|4.0|The vinyl's quality was very good however the package was bent so the vinyl was bent too. I tried to flatten it out but didnt work.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Growing up in the late 80's to early 90's this was and still is my favorite movie of all time. It's a fantastic movie for all ages  it's filled with comedy fun adventure and funny 1 liners. Corey Feldman is great as always.  I give it 5 stars a great family movie
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I wanted a simple app that would allow me to take notes and separate them by notebook.  It is simple and easy to use.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Lots of replay value and happy times.  Best free game I've ever downloaded.  Gotta buy everything in the game or else.
B002N1AEMS|2.0|I must say that i wasnt satisfied by this viynl. It has nothing to do with amazon.com. The quality of the viynl is bad. The peak voices are 'scratch'. The packageing was very good.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|hay it game musice,  it great for kids<br />even great for adult kids,  yoiu cant go wrong with it.  enjoy
B0037NVM2C|5.0|Great special effects<br />Storyline completes the whole concept - Arnold does well balancing the mean terminator job with the compassion for his human boy creator.<br />This is one of Arnold's best movies!
B000PEX1IE|5.0|If this is not a classic yet, it should be.  Love the Ghostbusters.  The DVD came well packed and undamaged.
B0071BY2OG|5.0|I received what I've ordered and it came faster than I had expected it to. Got this as a gift and he loves it
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore is the man. Ryan Lewis has really increased the production quality of his music, and Macklemore's experience and age continues to show in his quality hip-hop.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is geat very entertainmenting i couly stay home all day and play it. Give this game a shot and you wont regret it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is a amazing game if you have a good imagination. but pocket edition is the worst in the series because the maps are small. and there are probably just about 1/5 of the blocks in pc version. the xbox 360 version is inbetween the pocket edition and pc is the best. like no hunger meter or armor also the biggest reason is that there are no abanded mine shafts or natural caves. I recomend getting the game but if your short on money then save up for pc version or xbox 360 version. I also like that the world is endless in the pc and xbox version.  (sorry for the grammer mistakes) rate 5 or thumbs up so everyone can see this.
0451232852|2.0|If you are going to really read this book, buy it in the Kindle version so you can enlarge the type.  The type face in this is so small that you will need a magnifying glass to read it.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Nothing too exciting. Rather same old type of this genre. Not horrible but okay if nothing better to read. not a favorite.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is Judge Dredd as it should be. Too many people didn't get to see this when it was in theaters. I have no idea why because the trailer is awesome and had me ready. Unfortunately this is probably the last Judge Dredd movie that will be made unless the Blu Ray/DVD market realizes what they missed. This would have to get to cult status for us to get another one.<br /><br />Just buy this movie or rent it whatever its worth it. Karl Urban nails it.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|the opening was so slow we almost fell asleep. It was amusing in places but was not as we expected. Not one to watch again.
0061900656|5.0|Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas, who just became a big brother. It's really cute and is exactly what I was looking for to help my son transition from an only child to having a little baby in the house...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Has to be a favorite among Doomsday Preppers!! Nothing makes surviving doomsday like millions of zombies roaming around trying to eat you alive!!!
B004WO57E4|5.0|I was excited when my Husband gave this set to me. I love it and play every day. It runs perfect on windows 7 & I have not had any problems so far.  It is just like the old days when they 1st came out. Thank you Hubby!  Great game.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|nice game. good graphics and story. A little short compared to similar games. Ending was a little to short and simple
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I love, love, love this album, sorry CD. I think my favorite songs are Let Her Go and Holes. I play this CD at least once a day and quite often at work too. I want more of his work.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Sometimes says an &#34;Error Occured&#34; and freezes. Otherwise works good. If you have a favorite station, they'll list it. Being able to get TED Talks without the video is great and the app also records so you can playback at a later time.
B005VT42BS|5.0|This app is quite simple to use, which is good for novice like me. I like to see who's who.
0316228532|3.0|I'll start by saying that I have not read any of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, so I was not biased by her themes or writing style from the immensely popular series. I kept seeing Casual Vacancy at the bookstore and had read and heard good reviews of the novel so I gave it a whirl. The book starts out with the death of a council member, Barry Fairbrother, from a small town called Pagford in England. His death affects the entire town where he lives in both positive and negative ways. It's hard to keep all of the townspeople straight in your mind for the first few chapters, but once you delve further into the book it's fascinating to see the chain reaction Barry's death has as it impacts more and more people's lives. Harry Potter fans be warned that there are some VERY adult themes in this book, it's NOT a children's/teen's book by any stretch of the imagination and it quite morbid at times. That being said, I enjoyed reading Casual Vacancy because all of the characters were so well formed that you felt you had a real understanding of who they are and could sympathize with the struggles they go through (even if they are totally foreign to the struggles you have in your own daily life). I would recommend this book and will definitely read Ms. Rowling's next adult novel.
0141185163|5.0|If you think that without leaders...fascist or socialist the state will fall to anarchy and chaos, you need to read this. Written by Orwell between 1936 to 38 during the Spain's civil war while he is in the trenches, a vivid account of how people really worked together. Rather than the chaos the the propaganda spoke of, you'll start to see the the lies of the main stream media in America today.
1401322786|5.0|Each page makes you stop and think...An intertwining storyline that makes you  feel compassion and self reflective of moments in your life.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun and easy to read with a happy ending. Everything you could want in a chick flick. This book is perfect for one of those days where you just want to escape the world for a few hours.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy solitaire on my computer and now I have a version that is equally fun for my Kindle Fire HD.
034580404X|5.0|Love it ! And as always amazon had it packaged nicely and it arrived on time. The story for me was not about the sex, although that was interesting, or the fact that its a too good to be true story, but I loved reading how Anastasia turned Christian's world upside down and reading how he fell in love with her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The concept and the looks of the game is wonderful. I was eagerly waiting for the kindle version. Glad I finally found it.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|If you, a citizen of this world, had any strength at all you would be working to serve and protect the best that life has to offer. Anything else is meaningless.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This game is fun for a short time, but not as challenging as the one I have on my computer, which is a little disappointing.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love it so far. Too much for my six year olds to handle, but I enjoy it. can't get enough.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults, just makes you feel good - quality good although on my HD tv I found it to be a bit dark in places - not sure yet whether to lighten my screen settings
B00005221L|5.0|I think Dutch should be our next president of the United States of America! Tight action, great adventure, right on acting. It has my vote!
0525952926|5.0|What can I say about this book, I recommend it highly for anyone who enjoys history.  He weaves a story whether true or not with a history lesson, can't wait for the 3rd book.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I really enjoyed this interpretation of Tess of the D'Uberville. It was just a delightful to see. I have already watch it twice, and as I writing this review, I want to watch it again.
B000HL09SA|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  My favorite animal movie. It really captures the bond between humans and their pets.<br />The story behind the family is good also.
0783225903|5.0|Haunting, I feel somehow lost in my world of believing in reality. Is there a reality at all, or is this minute here and now only what I wish it to be?
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Started reading a few days ago. Easy reading, very instructive. Makes you see the difference between being good and great. Not only for businesses.
B000002L61|5.0|This was my second CD I got from Dio when it 1st came out. Now, since the passing of Ronnie James Dio, I wanted to make sure I had this metal classic in my collection. Long Live Rock n Roll Ronnie! Thank you amazon for the prompt shipping.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|I liked the other Ice age plots better, but I thought the 3D effects made the movie worth the purchase.  I think the 3D was well worth the purchase.  I like movies that show good quality 3D and effects come out at you.  This had the right 3D effects. I also enjoy Ice Age movies as does my husband.  So I would give the 3D effects 5 stars, the movie plot 4 stars.
0790731452|5.0|I have seen many things in my lifetime, but none so familiar to me as this real life reconstruction. I feel vindicated in my search for the truth that we all share.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I loved to play it. But  one day I went on it to play and all of my people and money were gone. So I would not get it if I were you.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This Cd is why there are so many Pantera fans. I already had this on Record/Tape & CD but I wore them all out and was time for a new one for my collection. Amazon is the only place to get quality hassle free items and I'm glad they have expanded getting more and more stuff to buy. Especially classic CD's such as this one.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|My husband is an over the road truck driver, he is also completely hooked on &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34;.  He can watch them over and over.  He really enjoys the laugh at the end of a driving day, every episode is completely entertaining.  I love them also! I have purchased all available seasons now and this is a new DVD, which I buy for my husband and the system he uses OTR.
1932100660|5.0|I have been to a public lecture by Mr. Campbell and have been to other lectures by other individuals that have cared enough to try to help their fellow human beings. This book of information can be a lifesaver if you take time to read it and learn from it. Do you can care enough to investigate all that is put forth in front of you?
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I watched the episodes on youtube after they had all been released. This production for a web mini series has far better production value than many of the more recently released science fiction movies that have been in theaters [e.g. Resident Evil/etc.] This series seems more like the intro to a movie, and you will feel like \\"why'd it stop, it was just getting started\\" However; it is still more than worthy of watching.<br /><br />Saw some reviews saying you had to be a gamer, play the game, to understand. That's not true at all. You can easily follow this movie, and understand everything. You would have a much greater appreciation for the subtly introduced items if you were a fan of the game, but easily feels like someone whom knew nothing of the game franchise can easily find it easy to enjoy the series.<br /><br />Worth the watch!!!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was very funny. Just didn't like the &#34;Puke&#34;. All should watch it. I am sure you will enjoy it as well.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Bought this from the same seller through Amazon with Super Saver Shipping.  Arrived as promised, actually before promised.  The Season was desired to complete the Seasons I had purchased for my husband (and over the road Truck driver).  We both enjoy The Big Bang Theory, this is as good as the rest.  I have watched allot of the Seasons with him and I also am watching the current Season on my TV through Dish TV.  I am getting the complete seasons for my husband to watch while he is away on his OTR driving.  Jerry loves comedy, and can watch the seasons over and over.  This gives him more variety, so he can now see every show from the beginning.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this app is awesome and its like what I play a lot and so far I have no problems with it
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Addictive! A must see.  The story line is both disturbing and brilliant. My only hope is that Walt will become a bit tougher character. The cast is great and they each have their own interesting quirks.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I like trying different types of music and this one turned out great. If you're a fan of indie rock try it you won't be disappointed.
B005I64U5C|5.0|The movie was very good and I enjoyed the plot, as did my grandson.  We watched this movie together in 3D, I sent the DVD copy inside the 3 disk set home with my Grandson.  I noticed it did not tell you this on the cover.  The set includes the 3D version, the blue ray 2D, and the DVD version.  I just made a cover for the movie and placed them in the Blue ray cases I purchased through Amazon for this, and I have my 3D version and my Grandson has his DVD version.  The effects are really good, allot of come out at you action.  I enjoy seeing that with the 3D movies I buy.  My LG TV will do the normal 2D to 3D conversion, so I like a movie made for 3D that makes my experience better.  This movie does that.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|great game but you can only play for a little bit and then make a new world other than that it is awesome.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|P.D. James is not my most favorite author or anything, but I do appreciate her attention to detail. I thought this book was a great sequel to Pride & Prejudice with the added murder mystery which was told in detail according to the customs of that time. I could tell the author did her research and created a very believable story around a murder in those times. I was a little disappointed in Colonel Fitzwilliam, though. I envisioned him as a better character. I also like how characters from 2 of Austen's other works (Emma & Persuasion) are referred to even though they aren't actually present in the story. Well done!
B0053O89IS|5.0|This is still one of the best show out there. I own all of the series so far and it keeps getting better and better. Finally Bones and Booth are together and they did a great job in the script and are still keeping it fresh and not messy. It's an enjoyable ensemble cast to watch.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I are blessed and thankful to have such easy access to the word of God. The most important and best book of all.
B009439HEY|5.0|I normally don't write reviews on purchases I make at Amazon, but this is just so special I felt I had to write something to encourage people to support this amazing reimagining of so many of the classic Genesis songs that we have all loved for most of our lives. The money they are asking for this album is a pittance compared to what you will receive. This is well over 2 hours of music. If you have ever wondered how the classic Genesis tracks would sound if they had been recorded today, using modern recording techniques and with all of the new tricks of the trade that are available to the artists making music today, this is the album you need to buy.<br /><br />The song selection is superb. Hackett sounds better now that he did back when he was 25, and he can now manage some guitar sounds and effects that he had only previously dreamed of in his head but wasn't capable of executing back in those days with the limitations of the equipment, the technology of the day, and the financial support that Genesis had access to.<br /><br />He has gathered together a vast army of amazing supporting musicians that share his love and reverance for the source material. Hearing Michael Akerfeldt from Opeth sing \\"Lover's Leap\\" from Supper's Ready is such a treat, and Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson's gentle, poignant vocals on \\"Can Utility and the Coastliners\\" is worth the price of admission alone. Simon Collins' vocals are wonderful and so evocative of his father.<br /><br />The alterations from the original recordings are extremely slight, if you are worried that the songs might have been greatly changed. I must admit, I pined a bit for the original recordings as I listened to this, but this reckoning of the songs is just amazing, true, and beautifully realized.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|My uncle has done it again!!! I absolutely loved the ending! It was pure genius! James Dashner is a great writer!!!
0761169253|5.0|I got this for my teenage artist daughter.....  I love the alarming title!!!  Who on earth could resist finding out what this book is all about???  We love it!!!  Thank You Amazon for sending it so promptly!!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|The movie was pretty good, but I paid extra for HD quality and it was far from that. Other movies I've purchased on amazon were standard def and were a better quality than this HD.
B009B0L324|5.0|Classic AC/DC songs done at the ultra-high intensity level you'd expect from the Boys...Paired this w/ Celebration Day by Zeppelin on a Legends Live playlist and it blows me away...
B009ZE27US|3.0|the game is ok but it gets kindve boring after awhile. plus it said I was 45.... and I'm nowhere near that.
0345803485|5.0|While the books in this series are of questionable quality: writing is pretty bad, characters are pretty shallow, predictable ending...  I LOVE that I didn't have to spend any more than I did on them.  Amazon to the rescue!  Again!!!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Batman is a little wimpy in this one!  They should have called this one Catwoman.  She did most of the fighting.
B001AEF6IQ|5.0|Love this series! This is a great buy and I love all the extras! The chemistry between the characters is great and the scripts and storyline are excellent.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Enjoyed the book very much.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Stephen King book.  Go buy it!
0345505387|1.0|If you adore Outlander, SKIP THIS!  It will just confuse you, and although the drawings initially show Jamie and Claire beautifully and, I believe, accurately, it quickly disolves into &#34;camp&#34;.  I already passed it on to a friend, who thought it pathetic as well.
B00571F26Y|5.0|We read it and went gluten free and we are glad that we did.  We are both in our 50's and in our second moth of gluten free eating.  We feel better, eat less and find our health improving.  Don't forget to exercise.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Fun with cool storyline and awesome graphics.  Loved it! Would buy more like this one. Please make more! creepy too...
1419705849|5.0|My grandson loves reading these book and I purchased this on as a Christmas gift for him.  He will have something to read during his time off from school
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Nice to play with freinds however the delete game button doesn't always respond and the app itself will often freeze
B006LSZECO|2.0|I stopped reading it midway through the book.  I understand that it won an award.  I just think there is more to literature than this poorly designed plot.  I wasn't interested in the characters either.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Fantastic! Only wish more seasons would be packaged as one instead of being split. Series 4.0, 4.5, blah, blah, blah...otherwise I love the accessibility rather than going to the store and getting disappointed if its &#34;out of stock&#34;.
1568363931|4.0|I have only made a couple of the recipes from this book so far, and they are great!! I can't wait for classes to start back up so I can have a tasty and healthy lunch to take with me!!
0307387178|5.0|I enjoyed the writing style and actually cared he did not make it at the end.  Krakauer wrote the story in such a way you actually began to understand why this young man did what he did and he was not crazy.  I believe a lot of people who complained about the kid since he represents who they once where, a man living by his own code figuring out life the best he knew how.  Much better in my opinion than Into thin Air.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The Pact is full of believable characters you can both sympathize and empathize with. You will not be disappointed. Tragic romance.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have not had any problems with this app working.  I wish that it would let you into your account to do more editing.  I cannot change the names of my boards or edit what is on them from this app.  Or if its possible I have not figured out how to do it!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is fun. I used to play it on set of the twilight. also I like that it gets fast.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Awesome movie, it is very funny and has lots of action, which is what I like the most of it.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|OK - Let's face it ! Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara are two of my favorite actresses. This portrayal of Santa is the absolute best and lets face it. Only the Post Office has the clout to prove he is for real and not imaginary. How long have we had the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade. This one is my favorite of all the different versions out there and this Blu-ray version is so much better than my VHS copy.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|gets the job done without any problems.  a pretty standard app so it works the same as the other non adroid versions!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is by far the BEST television series out there. I've had some favorites: Dexter, Carnivale, Deadwood...but those have nothing compared to Walking Dead.<br /><br />Normally the husband and I wait until a series is available on Netflix or just borrow it from a friend that owns a series. We couldn't wait. We're addicted. We had to purchase and we don't regret.<br /><br />This series is extremely realistic. Not only in the manner of costume and make-up but in real life scenario. What would you do in that situation? How would you escape? If you were the leader of the bunch how would you go about doing this? To whomever that haven't watched Seasons 1 and 2, I urge you to do so! Hold on tight cause it is definitely a thriller!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This movie has a lot of action and funny parts, which makes it a really good movie to add to your collection.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Have you ever had the thought that things would be better if you were never born ? Well, I have and I'm sure many others have had the thought too. This heart warming movie with Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed is one of my four must see movies for the Holidays and my most favorite of all. You have-to love the children and Clarence too. The chemistry between the lead characters is magic and  Donna Reed is a knockout. This Holiday movie is so good it'll send you to the moon. My four must see holiday movies are... It's a Wonderful Life - A Christmas Carol w/Alastair Sims - A Bishops Wife w/Carey Grant - and A Miracle on 34th St w/Natalie Wood.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app a lot to open PDF's.  I have trouble with my document writer not showing all the pictures from them.  I had not had any trouble with the standard uses of it either.
B008K3N68M|5.0|It's a lot of fun and highly entertaining if you enjoy historical drama.  It may not be historically &#34;accurate&#34; but it's fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works flawlessly, fun to play.  There are ads, but they are no big deal as they do not pop up while playing the game itself.  Watch out as the game can be addicting.  Love it!!
0743270754|4.0|I've read dozens of Civil War books and Lincoln bios, and DKG's contribution is strong and unique.<br /><br />I try to avoid the mainstream, oft-liberal efforts (Goodwin's history of writing is lauding only Democrats like FDR, JFK, LBJ; and she's spent her entire life in northeastern elite circles doing softball PBS interviews/talks) publicized by our schools and secular society, but I liked DKG's angle on the challenges Honest Abe met from his erstwhile rivals.<br /><br />Her analysis of the multi-faceted \\"rivals\\" who become Lincoln's cabinet is not an easy task and she excels.<br /><br />But, I wouldn't spout the typical clich&eacute; \\"If you have time to read only one Civil War/Lincoln book...read this one.\\"<br /><br />There are better efforts.<br /><br />Start with 'Lincoln: A Life of Purpose and Power,' by Richard Carwardine. GW Bush read that to better understand his presidency and why and when we go to war.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Rivals\\" is probably a tad too long, and of course, there could have been more on the actual battles (just as Spielberg's recent picture typically focused nothing on battles), but I can say I learned a few new things from Goodwin, therefore four stars.  Glad I read it finally.
1451627297|5.0|It had been some years since I'd read a Stephen King novel.  I don't enjoy horror or being frightened by a book or movie (very wimpy), but the man is such a great writer that sometimes I just had to read some of his work.  I was drawn to 1963 for two other reasons: time travel is such an intriguing idea, and I was madly in love with JFK when I was in elementary school.  I'm so glad I read this book.  It was phenomenal in many aspects.  As always, King's characterization is outstanding.  This may be why his most outrageous plots seem believable while I'm reading about these very real people.  The story line in 1963 is so full of complex detail that I became totally engrossed with the plot progression.  Nothing was predictable.  The ending was as satisfying as it could be, knowing the reality of things.  I just can't praise the book highly enough; I enjoyed it immensely!
B000KJT8IG|1.0|I should have heeded the reviews of this disc. It exhibits poor image quality and the 2 channel audio is an insult. Buy the DVD!!
B00A80SHFM|1.0|I had to continuously remind myself that this was a film interpretation, not a musical imitation. Regardless, this is a rough soundtrack. I understand that it's live recording but honestly, there are so many talented actors who can sing the music incredibly all while being live. Jackman and Crowe were terribly miscast. Yes, it's their interpretation of the characters but I felt like their voices were too weak to carry on such commanding emotions from their characters. Eddie, Samantha and Aaron are all fantastic singers, I hope to hear more of their songs with a complete recording. Anne Hathaway, however, is a different story. She is such a weak singer in this. It's clearly evident that Fantine is devastated but there are other ways to convey this emotion instead of whispering. After all, it is musical. And I hate how quiet the orchestrations are at times. There are so many actresses, like Sierra Boggess, who are incredible as Fantine and still bring a beautiful tune to the melody, all while sounding utterlessly hopeless. It was a good try but I felt like the beauty and power of the musical was lost. It doesn't feel the same, at all.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an awesome and fun game.  It is free.  I play it every day for hours.  Get this game.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A timely and topical novel at this point where China is beginning to flex muscle in the South China Sea - you can almost see the book coming true with a little imagination. This is a vintage Clancy that will be hard to put down - as we age with our old friend John Clark and watch Jack Junior become a key player.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this book...story is both interesting and thought provoking..wonderful author....my book club had a lot to say about this book and we really enjoyed discussing it.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|While my husband and I laughed at a number items, overall it was bad.  We kept watching think &#34;this has to get better&#34; but it didn't.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I don't know why people write long reviews:<br /><br />This is an entertaining film - if you love music and fun.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I love the movie, they took their time to make it. It entertainments a lot.  Quality on image is superb!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|really enjoyed this book..., this is the second Kate Morton book that I've read....love the author ...lots of great twists and turns.....great story.......couldn't put it down
B009E3EY38|5.0|The Concert started out decent. Cinematography was excellent, Sound quality is excellent. Page can still play, Plant can sing, not hitting the high notes, but then again he's what 65? Pages look reminds me of the Wizard on the Zofo cover. Bonzo's boy started off sounding like a pop band drummer. He sounded merely OK, but by the end, he was playing dad PROUD. Even had Jimmy and Robert smiling as he hammered away on Rock and Roll. Overall an excellent concert video, and a MUST HAVE for any Zeppelin fan!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a great film with real characters and a well told story WITHOUT violence and exploding special effects.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Great book only took one star off because at times the author seems to ramble. Reccomend for anyone not just runners.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Begining and end good but not enough Batman and toys in the middle. To much plot and not enough action. Worth watching but not owning.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Mothership is a collection of Zeps more popular tunes. Sound quality is good, I think How the West was Won is a better CD, but this one is a good addition to my collection
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this app in 5.0 but the price is steep I got it on 4shared.com for free! I highly recommend it its the best!!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|One of my favorite movies from my childhood. Reminds me of the innocence of youth. Good memories for any age.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this book.  I thought it was interesting and well written although it does jump around a bit.  I am not an extreme \\"dieter\\" but having been on a ton of different diets I could relate to the stories. The pictures were very sad but gave you a real sense of what horror she was living.  I highly recommend.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|As much as I love this music, I keep coming back to Crowe. Like Johnny Depp in &#34;Sweeney Todd&#34;, Crowe's singing experience was in rock bands and for something like this, a subtlety is required that both men had to learn. Whereas the musical theatre training of Hathaway, Jackman and the others allow them to sing quietly (or poorly if the drama of the scene requires it) with more control. Crowe doesn't have the vocal chops for that kind of precision. His trained-for-the-film voice is too smooth. Ironic for such a gutsy, instinctive actor.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Better than expected -- kid friendly, and a fun ride.  Not an award winner by any stretch, but a great popcorn movie!
B00A757EFW|3.0|this is game is ok but it could he better, the controls made it not so fun hahaha it gets boring after a while
B006OOHYIC|4.0|This game is so fun!! It's also addicting. Would like more levels and options. It's just too fun to step. I've got to get back to the game... ;)
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Simply said, The Weeknd is the truth. He has a beautiful voice and he goes to places<br />in his lyrics that other male artists are afraid to do. I love, love, love him :)
B007TK77QE|2.0|Well to sum it up, this book is extremely boring... It is well written, I'm not even going to question the characters are very well described but still the story is not able to be a page turner... it is good if you have insomnia... for sure your sleep will come right back...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so recommended addicting fun for all ages so much better than &quot;bridges&quot; i could be all day on it if i could
B00008A7QK|5.0|This is the only T-Rex album that I ever listened to; so I wouldn't know if they ever did better or not.  I can say that this album was really a hot item; back when it came out.  All the little babes loved it, and the big poster of Mr Bolen graced the bedroom wall of many a love sick teen age girl.<br /><br />But back to the music, This is a fun, mostly happy romp of an album with mostly bare bones rock/pop songs that make you want to sing along, even dance.  Bolen was not a great guitar soloist; but he was an excellent rhythm guitarist who obviously had listened to a few Chuck Berry tunes and copped a few licks. And he was a master songwriter of Pop and Funky rock.  He employed very interesting song lyrics full of suggestive and confusing metaphors, He used many different and innovative rhythyms and percussion to create infectiously GROOVY tunes.  His sound on this album was unique , I've never heard anything quite like it.  About the only artists I can compare him to were David Bowie and Donovan when he was in a more reflective mood.<br /><br />The contributions of Turtles/Zappa vocalists Flo & Eddie really add a wonderful, ironic counterpoint to Bolens low register vocals. Bolen was a good singer but did not often stretch his voice into the upper register; he relied on his innate sex appeal and spice it up with a lot of growls and sighs that are very tastefully done.  The guy had sex appeal in spades, and it shone through his vocals and rhythmns.<br /><br />This album is a Pop rock gem which is still relevant and doesn't sound dated like so many of the more adventurous efforts of the time.  I believe you could take some young musicians and re-release most of these songs; and it could still be potentially a hit.  Except the psychedelic inspired lyrics might not work with todays youth. But then again, maybe they would.  All told, this is an excellent effort by a creative young man who was trying to shed his Hippie/Flower Child persona and create a new, electric image.  ANd it succeeds beautifully.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is REALLY fun! The only thing is I can't get the Shadow Blade.Still fun!I love the graphics.But Openfeint pretty much ruins the app!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I had to buy this movie even though I went to see it in the theatre. I was mesmerized by the flic. It was exactly what I expected.
B009ZE27US|1.0|this game is a waste of space i dont see how people like this game this is very childish trust me u can not pull a prank on anyone with this app suckish if u get it u will regret it
6300215814|5.0|It's Audry, what else can I say she was wonderful. This movie is a classic and worth having in my collection.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I'm not going to bore you with a lot of words and critiques here. I'll keep it real simple...<br /><br />If you love action, adventure, laughter, a good mystery, cool action sequences, an army of bad guys after the hero, and a bunch of stuff blowing up, then this is the movie for you!<br /><br />This movie is awesome! It sits proudly in my collection of movies! A must buy for anyone raised up on Indiana Jones or TERRY AND THE PIRATES!
0385366752|5.0|This book was terrrific. I read it in audio form. The two readers representing the two main characters really made the book great listening. The story was fascinating. Great twists and turns!!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game has many awesome features! I love it! I want the full version ! please buy it it is awesome!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Best season yet! I can't wait until the next one. Packed with mystery and adventure, it surely keeps you hooked.
B0036TGSIK|1.0|Real short and real simple...<br /><br />This movie is aimed at middle school and high school girls, I guess..Which I'm neither.<br /><br />I loved Emma Stone's acting and her character, but, for me, the movie is so awful that even a cute and very talented Emma Stone couldn't save it!<br /><br />I'd rather take 2 weeks and read the SCARLET LETTER book that this movie is loosely based on than watch the almost two hours of this Easy A movie.<br /><br />Again, little kids and more serious fans of Emma Stone will have a great time and think that this movie is cool. More power to you all!..And enjoy!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This was a wonderful prequel to the series. My husband and I both really enjoyed the back story for one of our favorite series. The acting was good for a monster movie. The story was consistent and logical.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|When Susan sings you can hear the emotion of the words in her voice. Would like to have had a mix of tempo.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its very fun to play and its a good way to get rid of time its just Avery fun game
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|This was a great performance by Elizabeth Olsen. She definitely has some great acting chops, far exceeding her sisters. She held me rapt from the start to the end. The story was also excellent. Great movie!!
B009P5S11G|5.0|By far her best album since Good Girl Gone Bad. Sonically it is a different vibe. She adds such gravity to this album its hard not to listen to it. My favourite tracks: Diamonds Numb, Jump, Phresh of the Runway, Love is a Tragedy/Mother Mary, What Now
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My son wanted this game for his Kindle. He hasn't stopped playing it yet. Really neat, challenging game for kids to pay.
B00992CF6W|1.0|ive tried to download it several times and everytime i try again it says &quot;there was a problem while downloading minecraft pocket addition, please try again&quot; ... ive &quot;tried again&quot; many times and it still wont download :(
