B00DP3IESY|1.0|Sucked if not for the special effects and the fact that Morgan Freeman was in it, I would've never finished watching the movie.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|OMG, where do I start? Have you ever read a contemporary or new adult romance, written entirely from the male lead's perspective? Cause I hadn't before Tangled. I was laughing from pretty much page 2. Like laughing so hard I was crying. This was different and amazing and fun to read because of the humour entwined within the story. In some ways it was the typical love story, male player, meets beautiful smart woman, wants her, can't have her. The viewpoint is the deviation from the normal, and it's great! Drew Evans is successful, driven, and has no problem with the ladies, until Katherine Brooks. Katherine isn't at all what Drew expects, or is used to. She is taken. Not only is she unavailable, but she is determined, smart, beautiful, and has a very smart mouth. Their chemistry is undeniable. Drew knows what he wants, and he wants Katherine. Long story short, there is drama, hilarity, heat, more drama, more hilarity, more off the charts heat, you get the point. I loved this story. It was different, and refreshing, getting a complete story written from Drew's perspective. Ladies, the male mind is a dangerous and hilarious place to hang out for a while. If you like contemporary and new adult romances, Tangled is not to be missed. I loved the formula used here, and I am anxious to read whatever Emma Chase gives us next! Congrats on an amazing, hilarious, smart, steamy read!!
B00AEBB9CS|5.0|Dark movie but so intriguing.  Daniel Day Lewis is amazing.  Every time I watch it I realize I missed some subtle piece of info so it's good to watch it more than once.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|Action for the &#34;Third age&#34;  but still likable. All characters well play by the famous artist,... Waiting for Red 2, coming soon...!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Good time action movie with a LONG list of cameos by past action stars.<br />Stallone is more enjoyable when he doesn't take everything serious.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|And good puzzles. I was disappointed; however, that there are only 10 levels. I finished it in less than a day. I look forward to the update and hope there's more than just 10 levels.

B00571F26Y|5.0|Always wondered what it was about when hearing someone who stopped eating gluten and such.<br />Now I know. Have changed everything instantly about how we eat. I like the genetics and the history and science bit of it as I'm a bit of a science nerd in my spare time. Now I understand why I have tits, a big belly and constantly feel crappy and get sick several times a year, not to mention poor digestion. Buy it, I'll change your life.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thought I would hate, but because of the amazing word of mouth I gave it a shot.  I understand why there was so much buzz.  I am telling my friends to watch as well.

B004SBULWE|5.0|Very handy and well designed. I use  it to close background apps quickly. Helps conserve battery power. Easy to use.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I love the cast of this movie, but as a comedy it just did not deliver. More time is spent listening to the cast yelling at each other, than laughing at funny part. The older daughter delivers all her lines in this teen,angst scream.  Its more of a drama with raunchy, funny bits.
B0064J6PMI|5.0|I'm a big fan of Ryan Reynolds. You gotta get this, he's great. Fantastic movie. I highly recommend it. Excellent.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My kid loves most of dr. panda's games. Dr. Panda's handyman is entertaining, the characters and animation get 5 stars.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My granddaughter asked me to play this game so she could have someone to visit. It has given as some special time together and we have been having a blast trying to see who can finish the quests first. The graphics are beautiful and I love that there is no violence.  Awesome family game.

B009VIZDLI|3.0|This book was very average. I was waiting for some excitement to happen but it's your typical love story with a little twist. Didn't make me want to turn and read the pages with excitement.
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|This was an awesome adaption of one of the time honored favorites that created the legend of the Dark Knight! I loved it and seriously need more animated adaptions like this!
B00594XOZU|3.0|i really enjoy using this app, i have it on my phone &amp; i just got it on my kindle. the only problem is that i signed in on my kindle &amp; when i went back to my phone it cleared my message history :( (some of those messages were important to me) please tell me there is a place they r saved?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I would recommend this game to everyone. Easy at first, then you have to really think toget the flow in the right place.
B00062IDCO|5.0|Season 7 was like seasons 1-5  that I ordered recently top & bottom cover episode index on the back picture on front did not look like it came from a zerox machine . These guys get it when you buy a series you want it to look good on your shelf as well as work properly, their name is Disc Discount and yes I would buy from them again , actually I gave season 6 to my local library the DVD's work it was just the ugly packaging and I will buy it again. Deep Space Nine is also on the list.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun! On my break, before bed, at lunch, while watching tv, all the time! Oh kids love it too. Lol.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome book.  Loved all the twists.  Definitely a hard book to put down the further you get into it. It is a must read.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|One cover is a little used looking but other than that both seem to be working good, and got both in the same package in great time for 2 little kids birthdays!!!

I already received the movie and just getting ready to have a nice quite late night alone to watch this long awaited movie with no distractions.
159463176X|3.0|I am a huge fan of Khaled Hosseini's first two books. This one felt disjointed. The first vignette/story was great, and it also finished off the end of the book; If that could have been made into a short story it would have been amazing. I felt the middle was just filler, and depressing. There were so many chapters -- even to the very end of the book, where you have no idea who is narrating until the middle of the chapter, and then it changes again. Total pet peeve. Anyway, I do love this author and found some great nuggets of wisdom in this book. I will still read whatever he writes next, but I wouldn't recommend this book.
B003BNY6Z8|5.0|Had this movie before however I had loaned it out and never got it back (some friend huh?). So, of course I had to get it again CAUSE I JUST LOVE AL PACINO, and AMAZON just happened too have it, soooooo I needed to buy it ASAP, best classic move ever..(besides &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34;) a must see and very realistic you won't regret it if you are a die hard gangster movie!
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Kid Rock does it again. He's multi-generaltional in his music. Not into his previous rap...but his more country rock is awesome. Down to earth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game it's a runner and that's why I like it  it's like an rpg game that's why it's so fun so I hope you like it
B000002GIE|3.0|Extreme's debut is quite promising. Most Extreme fans would rank this their third favoutire of the albums, with pronograffiti their most favourite followed by Three side to every story, and the debut (probably followed by sausage de rock and then punchline at the bottom).<br />I'd actually have to disagree go against the grain a little bit (surprise surprise) and wager pgraffiti and Waiting for the as a tie for best, with three sides a clear third, and then the debut (haven't heard 'de rock' yet but I'm sure it's good).<br /><br />The first album features themes predominated by childhood, teenagehood and growing up in general (most of their albums have a lyrical 'theme').<br /><br />The main problem with the album is that the band's playing is a bit loose, and they aren't gelling cohesively as well as the next few albums, but this is common amongst 'debuts'. The vocals aren't fitting in that well, and it's sometimes hard to understand the lyrics. Don't get me wrong, the musicianship is excellent, but the way the band meshes and the execution is a bit amateurish.<br /><br />Although a fan favourite, 'Little girls' is one of my least favourite Extreme songs, the bands playing is loose and the lyrics stink. Things quickly pick up, and tracks 2 - 7 are all rather good, to varying degress; 'Wind me up' is the ultimate 80's pop-metal song, 'Kid ego' and 'Don't wanna go to school today' work really well, and 'Teachers Pet' is a real rave up with fun lyrics about a schoolboys favourite fantasy.<br /><br />'Big boys don't cry' - what is this? Musically it's meant to sound like Van Halen's 'When it's love', but includes portions of Leslie Gore's 'It's my party and I'll cry if I want to' to make it's point, and lyrics that make Elvis Costello seem like a cool big tough guy by comparison. Great song!<br /><br />Of the remaining songs 'Where there's smoker there's fire' is a good song, but the execution is terrible, and songs like 'Flesh and blood' and 'play with me' feel rushed, leaving 'Rock a bye baby' with it's epic guitar solo.<br /><br />A good start and they had more success coming, but then grunge came and they lost their sucess!
0385486804|1.0|the book is still readable, however it is scribbled all over in illegible notes by a ninth grader, according to the inside cover of this book. I suspect this used to belong to a school and was given to a student who does not know how to annotate properly.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is a MASTER of the written word.  His books and novels are always captivating, no matter the length.<br />I had just finished his doorstopper novel The Way Of Kings and was blown away, and unsure if anything I could read would live up to it.  I had The Emperor's Soul on my Kindle and I figured I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />The story is short, and mostly takes place in a single room.  That's right, most of the action happens in a single room where a woman is kept essentially as a prisoner.  And yet, through her actions and words and memory and interaction with the characters, as well as the reason she's being kept locked up and her enormous task to perform while there, build us a world and characters that feels as real as any other.  Everything here is so artfully crafted that I was left wishing there was more.<br /><br />Fans of fantasy rejoice, Brandon Sanderson is here and everything he writes is worth reading.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It is a good game but when i first saw it i thought it would be dumb turns out it's not
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I like how you can battle against online people . Hey now I can expand my base to get more money great online game .
B00DNO3JUI|5.0|I saw this movie years ago, and it's one that I always remember when I see it, and I've rewatched it more than once.  It's intense, sensual, violent, dark and memorable.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book makes history come alive.  You live every moment through the characters.  It also should remind us to never let anything like a Hitler to ever lead again.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love the cd. It was delivered on time and was packaged appropriately. The price was excellent and I would recommend this cd to any Bruno Mars fan.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very suspenseful.  I really enjoy this show!  If you like alien stuff, this is your show!  Walking dead meets outer space!
B009GN6DT4|5.0|My kids were 8 and under when this came out. I bought it now for their children when they come to visit. They love it. Ages 4 - 6.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very nice game, it's like temple run but with better character, more fun. I wish they had a full version without evil in-app purchase.
B00821OX98|3.0|I found it hard to get to know characters and the basic premies for the show. Conflicts were presented but I did not understand enough  about the story to get it. I has watched four shows and try to pick it up.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|interesting to me that the NTSB hung an alcoholic pilot out to dry for doing what 10 clean and sober pilots couldn't do in a simulator without a hundred screaming passengers. Did anybody drug test the investigators?<br />Loved the movie! Denzel's performance was flawless.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|brilliant characters realistic presentation superb plot and depiction of the landed gentry of that period. This  is a series that the family can watch. I had watched the USA tv version and found the uk  tv version just as enjoyable as the first time I watched.<br />It is so refreshing to see new works available instead of remakes of originals just changing the actors. city destruction stupid car chases and other anti social rubbish.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This cd is amazing.  Buy it, pop it in (or download and hit play),  sit back with a cup of something tastey (like coffee) and enjoy it.  From the beginning to the end it is beautiful. His voice is gorgeous and the songs are great. I can't even pick a favorite off of this cd. I love all of the tracks.<br /><br />It's a little package of happy.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Enjoyable for relaxing when to tired to exercise the little grey cells on difficult puzzles. Would be good for children just learning to do logic games..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good fun! Graphics are good and the content is excellent. Could be better if the items up for purchase weren't as expensive
B00BF11UM0|5.0|This movie helped in understanding the work intelligence professionals do, to keep the homeland safe. And the incredible patience it takes to find a needle in a haystack. All to the end of keeping our homeland safe.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|One of the best films in the past 25 years.<br />Best in its original Italian.<br />This is a film for all time.
1400064287|5.0|This book is pretty interesting and an easy read. Even though I had to buy it for a class, I actually enjoyed it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Until now, I had never read a book that took my heart. Superbly written, and relatable. Thank you John Green.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I loved this book.  It was interesting and sad to learn that a star's child was treated so badly. The money Shirley gave to her ex husband to travel in space was downright freaky. This is a story of a daughter that practically raised herself while having a parent who is world famous. Just goes to show you never know what goes on in Hollywood.  I would recommend it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I have a kindle fire HD and this you app sucks. It always says loading and the vids are horrible they are very blurry. PLEASE FIX!!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The depth of the characters deepens and the saga's twists and turns build to a point where you do not ever want this epic to end.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The depth that the author goes to when recounting this war is astounding. It really gives the book an epic scope and allows the reader to imagine what the war was like in every part of world.
B000HZD168|5.0|I loved Ricardo Montelbahn...not sure if I spelled it correctly, but he added alot to the screen.  He truly was a great &#34;bad&#34; guy.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|I thought it was very well made, professionally done, yet somehow slightly bland.<br /><br />The cast were uniformly good in their respective roles.<br /><br />More Pepper please!! Ms. Paltrow under-utilized AGAIN!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|My family and I used to watch the old Star Trek television shows on public television.  We did not have many options for channels, as cable was not in our neighborhood.  We did not have cable until I was well into my teen years, nearly high school.  I loved the television shows, as well as the movies that these particular characters stared in.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is a well written edgy novel by bestselling author Gillian Flynn. Flynn is known for writing books with dark and edgy characters. Gone Girl carries on that tradition. The background seems simple enough at first. Nick and Amy Dunne are about to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. Amy is from the northeast, the daughter of two famous psychologists and authors. Her parents created the popular Amazing Amy series of books. Nick is the son of a working class divorced couple from North Carthage, MIssouri. He moved to New York to work as a writer for a magazine. Both lost their jobs in the publishing industry and eventually moved to North Carthage to care for Nick's sick mother.<br /><br />Then the unthinkable happens. Amy disappears. The door of the house is open and there is blood on the floor. The place has been turned upside down. What has happened to Amy? Is Nick responsible? As the story unfolds people begin to take sides and as secrets come out no one seems to know how to distinguish truth from fiction.<br /><br />The story is told in first person by Nick and through Amy's diary. This makes for interesting pacing. Everything in the story is narrated as something that has already happened. At the same time it becomes clear that our narrators are not altogether honest with themselves, or with us. Gone Girl is one of those books that is difficult to review because there are so many plot twists and turns and a good review should never spoil the story.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has crafted a taut, edgy, thriller that will keep even seasoned readers guessing what is going to happen next. I am usually one step ahead in most mystery novels, I was in the dark through much of this book. That is not normal, but was quite enjoyable. I won't say that the characters are likable, they are not. They are not meant to be likable. Flynn examines the dark side of life and shows that what you see on the surface may not be what you find when you dig a little deeper. This is a riveting story and is highly recommended.s a riveting story and is highly recommended.
144476490X|5.0|Even tho I have not yet read this book, I know I will enjoy it as much as I did A STREET CAT NAMED BOB.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is a cute version of Angry Birds.  Some of the episodes are quite challenging.  I think that everyone who likes Angry Birds will like this version.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|DO NOT watch previews...it gives too much away. I had no idea what to expect...so I watched the trailer...the twists were revealed in the trailer.
B00C061I3K|5.0|At first I was expecting something totally different, but after listening to the album a few more times I started to appreciate the songs more and Daft Punk dedicated the album to &#34;music.&#34;
B008602KQI|5.0|...and the casting was great.  The girl who played Rue almost stole all her scenes she is that good.  I hope they do as well for the rest of the series.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Helps women become empowered to be all that is within them to be. This is NOT done by bashing or diminishing men!! I hope this book leads to further discussion but more importantly further soul-searching by women and men alike.<br /><br />Women, don't let the main person holding you back be the person in the mirror looking back at you.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta do Not disappoint . Locations and stories woven together with twists that take you on a wild ride to the truth. Another must read

B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I bought this cable to use it on my Bosé Soundock. It works great. If I connect it to the Tv the amp makes the speaker buzz... not a good idea, but it still works on the soundock.
0981951252|5.0|You will not regret buying this product. CD are worth every dollar. Fill with valuable information for anyone. From MLM people to people that just want to loose weight or change something in their life. I was not sure who Darren Hardy was but if everything he does is like this he will become one of my favorite writers.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|This was so much better than the first book. Although this book was far more of an adventure, while the first was a love story. This book is a love story too, but there is much more depth.  I do appreciate the metaphor of war, and how there can be more to one side than meets the eye.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|You just knew that the Tedeschi Trucks Band had to happen.  Each one had already had success on their own and had guested for each other during live performances, but the Husband & Wife team of Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi takes it to a higher level.  Searing guitar with soulful vocals along with a tight band makes for a most enjoyable listen.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|This app is a pretty fun way to kill some time!  Fairly easy but occasionally I need a \\"hint\\".  (Then it's like, \\"duhhh!\\"  LOL!  All in all, I would recommend this game to someone who doesn't want something too complicated.
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|It's cool asf' I neverrr heard if anything like this before but it's really really cool it also might be a scam the only Pisa at I don't like is wen it's loading it say sniffing air crack

B007J4T2G8|1.0|just read the first chapter<br />too graphic, inhumane behaviour<br />really disgusting<br />love & sex should be intimate between two people who love & respect each other.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is a wonderful product. Came in appropriate manufactured packaging. Gift wrapped. Works great. Traditional black ps3 controller by Sony. Perfect replacemebt if your orginal ps3 remote stops working. Worth the investment.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|This book was very hard to read. Hard in that it hurt to see what really happened to our Native Americans. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee reveals the atrocities, lies and deceit that the U.S. Government used to destroy and imprison the &#34;True American People&#34;. All of which was done under the guise of civilization. Who truly were the civilized people in the struggle for the North American lands?
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|It was awful. After giving it 30 intolerable minutes, I decided I had better things to do with my time.  Sorry I watched what I did.
B000002TQV|5.0|Somehow I missed this music but was led to it by my music instructor. Much in the vein of Wilco or REM. Really like it.<br /><br />My only issue is with the condition my products arrive when shipped in the bubble wrap envelopes. Can anyone out ther give me the names of some suppliers that use heavier packaging to avoid damaged product?
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have read all three books and am always amazed at the passion and feeling I get from all of the characters..
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Good character development and story line.  Although I did have to cheat and read the last few pages when I became too nervous about a particular possible outcome.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Bob Fosse's life story some say and yet it touches everyone life at some point.  You can evaluate yourself by who you identify with in the movie.  Best music, dancing, acting, story at several levels, drama, humor, shock, sexy and fun.  See this and you can see that &#34;Chicago&#34; was originally produced in All That Jazz in 1979.  Roy Scheider is stunning in his performance as well as every major participant!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Perfect game. Period. I spent 100 hrs on this game and could easily spend twice that trying the get the platinum. Have too many other games to play though so I never got around to that. Buy this game!!
8866137626|5.0|I love Evernote and this makes it even better.  It is a great sized book - fits easily into my pocket(s).  It is amazing how easily the pages are photographed and loaded into Evernote. The OCR is pretty accurate - even with my handwriting!
B00CWVFZ8W|5.0|Loved it! Thought the story was well developed and mysterious. The characters were interesting and not the typical. If you are looking for an hour or so of get away time, enjoy!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|It's the Goonies. Nothing else needs to be said. If you have not watched this movie, what is wrong with you.
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies has every character that Steven Spielberg has produced into this series. From Indiana Jones, to ET, to Band of Brothers. I have never been happier with a science fiction story since  Next Generation. I hope this series can continue, even after these aliens leave.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|played it a few times and loved it now it wont load. its so annoying I wanna play it badly!  please fix it
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Great story but they missed defining the invisible characters...thoughts and projections are Real..they can be illustrated......they are felt ...following them is fun.l.
B000HC2PCM|5.0|Great CD. It plays in my car all the time --- The Old Man From The Mountain is my favorite.  Great CD. Great singer. Great songs.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it is very fun and cool to play and you should play it sometime. As him mom this game is actually really fun, I didn't think it would be but I'm glad to say I'm wrong. If you a fun cheap (free) game this is it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I re-read books 1&2 before reading this one. I'm happy I did that first. I think I would have been confused otherwise. I really want to read book 4 NOW!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Yes this is a new \\"TREK\\". But, as in \\"MAN OF STEEL\\", these characters have not been given the OPPORTUNITY to \\"seek out new life and new civilizations\\". They are just getting started. So my only complaint is they brought Cumberbatch's character in too soon. This new crew should've been given time to become the family that the old crew did. That being said, this is a terrifically entertaining film. The cast has put their spin on these beloved characters and doing it quite well. I like how Chris Pine has avoided doing a Shatner impersonation, but you can almost see a young Bill in his performance. No matter where or what he is doing, if a young lady walks by, he stops,turns, and introduces himself. Gene Roddenberry long ago passed on the baton and every new filmmaker will put their stamp on his vision. I have every original cast members autograph, but very few of the Next Generation's. They weren't my cup of tea, but they were for millions of others. So instead of lamenting that this isn't Gene's vision, be glad you can still see the \\"STAR TREK\\" name on the marquee after almost 50 years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me., my husband and daughter all play this game. We enjoy the challenges and the changing countries. Glad you've added some new fun things like the power jump. Fun!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I chose this rating because each episode left me wanting for more! I couldn't stop watching it and I can't wait for the next series to start!
B000FC13MM|2.0|Everything comes around without much explanation... most of the time I prefer books where everything no matter how abstract is explained in some way or another so that the reader has an understanding of the limits in someway. Other books captivate me right away and the lack of explanation does not face me... Sabriel did none for me... It is still very recommended by many so maybe I'm missing something...
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Beat the games<br />Free download and install it on the games and graphic design will not have a lot of people in this
030758836X|1.0|By far one of the worst books I've ever read - especially disappointing after the hype of it being on the best seller list for so many weeks!  What does that say about the American reader? OMG!<br />Her writing style is appealing but the characters most unappealing.  And the ending ?? Atrocious is an apt description.  Fuggedaboutit.  (sp?)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game subway surf is epic it is some times confusing but the rest is awesome and epic I love this games and would recommend this for everyone and suitable for all ages
B000B589JI|5.0|This gadget from zippo holds enough lighter fuel to refuel my lighter twice. On top of that it has a nifty little tool to open the flint spring (which is nice!) & it is all on a keychain.  On the downside is the flint holder: it's too tight to actually hold a flint AND get it back out - but with all the other pluses this is still a 5 star gadget!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It showed me new words and ways to pronounce other words but I think there was to many pages,I would recommend this book (Dictionary).
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Other than the fact that objects were occasionally duplicated, causing confusion over why it wouldn't take the object as found, this game is a very good quality game. Sharing on Facebook and creating reviews are optional, but it never hurts to throw them a bone. Plays well on my Kindle Fire HD.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love this series, but the last episode seemed gratuitous. Apparently the actor in question was moving on to other projects, but it was just one death too many for my tastes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is very entertaining. got stumped a couple of times but it wasn't too difficult to solve the puzzles.  cant wait for the other level to come out.
B00DL47RQ2|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0<br /><br /> With 'Blue Jasmine', Woody Allen has managed to come up with a film that invites comparisons with one great work from theatrical history as well as a more recent true-life story, ripped from the headlines involving the financial world. He cleverly merges these two disparate stories into a fairly gripping tale that will keep your interest to the end, but eschews the complex references from his source material, which make those narratives, much more compelling.<br /><br />Jasmine, Allen's anti-heroine, is obviously based on Ruth Madoff, who was married to Bernie Madoff, who committed the greatest Ponzi scheme in history. In the film, the Madoff character is 'Hal' (Alec Baldwin), a mega-rich investment counselor who ends up being arrested and kills himself while in prison (in real life, of course, it's Ruth's eldest son, who ends up committing suicide). Jasmine moves to San Francisco, moving in with her working class sister, which invites comparisons with Ruth, who moved in with her sister for a while, down in Florida. In the film, Jasmine has one son, who ends up moving to California, who she's estranged from. The real-life Ruth was estranged from her two sons but eventually, I believe, reconciled.<br /><br />'Blue Jasmine' jumps back and forth in time, as the seemingly tragic tale of Jasmine unfolds. When she moves in with her sister, it becomes obvious that Woody Allen is developing his story by taking a page from the Tennessee Williams play book. Jasmine, bearing a striking resemblance to Blanche Dubois from 'Streetcar named Desire', is now caught up in a love triangle involving her sister Ginger, and her new working class lover, Chilli (played by Bobby Cannavale), who also appears to be Woody's version of 'Stanley Kowalski'. While I loved Cannavale in 'Boardwalk Empire', and think he's a great character actor, 'Chilli' is not as complex a character as Williams' Stanley Kowalski. Cannavale's character (along with some of the other characters including Ginger's ex, played by Andrew Dice Clay) seem more like they belong in 'The Sopranos' or 'The Jersey Shore', than denizens of San Francisco.<br /><br />As the story moves along, Jasmine continues to maintain the illusion that she's important and seeks to restore her social status, which was ripped from her, following her husband's arrest. Woody Allen wants us to feel some sympathy for Jasmine after her employer, a dentist, sexually harasses her. Jasmine's initial plan is to take an online course to become computer literate and later become an interior designer (isn't it more likely that she could find a tutor to help her with computer skills?).<br /><br />Finally, Jasmine realizes that her salvation is in finding another rich man to assist her in maintaining her past lifestyle. The way she handles her romance with Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard), a State Department employee, who has aspirations to become a Congressman, is indicative of her ongoing delusional frame of mind: of course she'll be eventually found out, if Dwight runs for office! But so determined to return to the good graces of the nouveau riche, she'll ignore the obvious fact, that there's no chance in hell of her ever escaping the watchful eye of the media (I doubt in real life that Ruth Madoff would have been so delusional, that she would entertain the thought of marrying herself off to an aspiring politician and actually believe that she could then escape discovery of her sordid past).<br /><br />The high point of Woody Allen's plot work comes when Dwight finds out about Jasmine's subterfuge. I was expecting Chilli to spill the beans (no pun intended), but it's actually Andrew Dice Clay's character, Augie, Ginger's ex, who happens to run in to Dwight and Jasmine by chance on the street, and pours out bitter feelings of being betrayed, both by Jasmine and Hal.<br /><br />There's also a sub-plot that moves quite nicely, involving Gingerhaving an affair with a kindly audio engineer, Al. Chilli blames Jasmine for causing Ginger to regard him as a low life but in a nice plot reversal, Al turns out to have been cheating on Ginger all along. Did Chilli get to Al's wife and let him know what was going on? Or did the wife, simply figure things out on her own?<br /><br />In the end, 'Blue Jasmine' is a derivative tale that manages to entertain. Cate Blanchett, who reminds me of a middle-aged Lauren Bacall, does well in attempting to remind us of Blanche Dubois, stuck in unrelenting self-illusion. The problem is that Woody Allen doesn't know his 'Blanche Dubois' character personally as Tennessee Williams did. Thus, we 'get' Jasmine's self-illusion act in the first thirty minutes. The character arc remains the same and that's exactly Allen's point: the character never learns and never grows. Perhaps Blanchett's best scene is where she confronts Hal at the end, when she finally accuses him of infidelity. But Jasmine's whole history, feels superficial; Woody conveys the superficiality of Jasmine's lifestyle in a schematic way, not like the complicated fictional character of a Blanche, or a real-life Ruth.<br /><br />While Jasmine's one-note character is one of the film's limitations, Woody Allen does manage to come out on the right side of the film's main ethical question. Should we in the end, view Jasmine as a sympathetic figure? Woody, I believe, says no. After all, Jasmine wasn't planning to marry Dwight because she loved him--she simply wanted to be re-established, in her former world of luxury, and continue to look down on all the 'little people', who she regarded as her social inferiors.<br /><br />As a director who has immersed himself for years in the history of film, Woody Allen continues to churn out decent, 'journeyman' work of late. Don't expect any great poetry or descriptive narrative based on a complex historical world, but this is a director who knows how to cast and work very well with an excellent crew of actors and create a story, which moves quite decently, from A to Z.having an affair with a kindly audio engineer, Al.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. Entertains the kids for long periods of time, easy to use, many costumes to choose from, love it!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|watching with my college aged kid ( have to convince her to ignor the title, which is not a good one). she is now hooked too!
B004LROMWU|4.0|Great show if you like aliens fighting humans. One of the best scifi tv shows. Watch it now! Do not wait.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|The obvious is not the answer in this mystery. Although a bit wordy in spots, the readers interest is captivated and held untill the finale.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline are timeless actors.  They are warm, engaging and hilarious in this movie!  Breathtakingly lovely scenery.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|On one level it is very simple.  It allows you to keep notes.  But on another level, it is extremely powerful.  It allows these notes to be accessed from all of my electronic devices - Iphone, Kindle, laptop & my PC at work.  It's super handy to be able to jot down a quick note at any time during my day/night, and access it later.  The notes are organized into notebooks.  It also integrates with my web browser (Chrome) to quickly move a web page of information to a note.  Even other applications integrate with Evernote to make it even more useful.<br /><br />This is one of the most powerful programs that I have ever used.  It is simple, practical and yet amazingly powerful in day-to- day practical use.  I love it.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Beautiful scenes from the English countryside accompanied by lovely wardrobe choices of that time period.  This movie has much to offer and is pretty graphic in some of its.  A few mature situations and some disturbing stories and pictures of the treatment of the African people brought to England by ships.  A love story is of course entwined in this very Jane Austen novel.  Great movie!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Introversion is not weird or wrong but a natural way of being. Many thanks to Susan Cain for affirming this fact and showing how our culture often makes us introverts feel out-of-sync even though we are vital to a healthy society.
B004SIP8JI|4.0|Excellent acting by both Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman.  Beautiful time period costumes and scenes from Leopold's home town.  Very good movie!
B003V5CFV8|5.0|My son, 12, partner and I throughly enjoyed the movie and the great music.  A rare treat.<br />The cast is perfect, the humor offbeat, the story engaging.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|25 years of Les Miserables performances. The show was the best of the best. Outstanding, for all you lovers of this timeless show!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun game...not too difficult but addictive. Would like to see more levels. I gave it three stars because they make you write a review to go any further. They should have a little more faith in their app.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Perfect cast, perfect costumes, sets, locations, music, everything. J.K. wrote a world-changing book, and Chris Columbus brought it to the screen wonderfully. It's not my favorite of all the movies, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I dislike the fact that you have to wait so many mins to earn tokens to play, I absolutely love the interaction of playing with REAL PEOPLE:) Overall, it's worth the download.
B003M7BLOW|3.0|I thought I could replace the processor in my old computer with this one, however when I installed the computer would not boot up.  I had to reinstall the old processor.  All of the information provided by the manufacture indicated that this was a good replacement however it is not.

B000059QYB|5.0|It was so Perfect!!!!!! And the cd never did skip at all!!!! For each song had never skipped at all!!!!!!!
1400032717|5.0|I am going to start by telling you this: The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is not a mystery, not really. People may claim it to be one, but truly, it is all about Christopher Boone. As a girl with Asperger Syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder, I found myself thrilled with the author. Though for some, the odd, blunt tone of voice that Christopher has might bug them, for me, it was heartbreakingly accurate. The author does a good job at getting into an Autistic child's head and, while I am not as bad nor ever will be as bad as Christopher, I can see how I could be. Overall, it's one of the best books I've read in a long time.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  Could not put it down.  The story is so romantic and a true love story
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this for everything: projects, journals, lists.  If you use it, make sure you also download the web clipper.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I want more! Love this game.  Right up my alley.  Need more games like this. The harder the better.  Hoping for more rooms soon. When I get stumped, I put presidency come back later and get it right away.
B00B935SUY|5.0|OMG. Awesome. Did not want this film to end.  As a fan of all of the artists in this documentary, I was riveted by every moment captured in the studio and personal interviews.  Now I'm pissed my mother would never let me have a drum set. The way Dave embraces each aspect of the rise and fall of sound city is an emotional roller coaster. This is a must see for music enthusiasts.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Another great book by David Baldacci.  Have read many of his.  Enjoyed all of them.  Can't wait for the next one.
B0053B347M|3.0|Title says it all, they are a good value at the price, but they are not too bright.  Also, the fact that they take a usb slot is inconvenient as i have 2 strips (1 behind each monitor) and thus i end up just using a powered usb hub plugged into the wall. Also they are only able to do white, no color change Lastly the adhesive on them is somewhat weak, but hasnt given out, i just push the end back on every so often. I will likely trade it out for one of the lighting kits from ikea soon.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|if you're thinking about watching this... just do it.  be warned however that your life is going to be taken over in some way
B00785P2QC|3.0|It keeps me busy for a while. My brother and I love  to compare our cities. The game could go a bit faster though.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This app lets you steal cars and kill people and Rob banks in missions. I think gangstar Vegas is awesome
B000BYA5G4|4.0|Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors, but my love for Jared Leto is what determined my desire to want to watch this movie. I had seen it before but had no idea who Jared Leto even was the first time I watched it. Story line was great. Ethan Hawke was great as the DEA agent running after Nicolas Cage to try and catch him in the act. Jared Leto's role as Nicolas' brother Vitaly was awesome. It was apparent that money can buy you anything including weapons to destroy entire countries.
B008469DGY|1.0|This was a wonderful game until the last update. The game no longer registers when you hit the ball. You have to hit like 7 times before it registers<br />I tried leaving feedback for game in the iPhone and the company has made it that new reviews are not posted!
B0000541AM|5.0|...if Hollywood made more tight, sharp, snappy, wildly entertaining low-budget films like this superb little 70's gem then studios wouldn't be going out of business..
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This series is fun to watch.  The plot and turns keep us eager to see what comes next.  We watched season 2 in one sitting.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Action packed and I liked the way the two agents paths interwove. For people who like action and mystery thrown in they will love this. The villain can elude you because of the process of elimination. Well done!
B0049J2BSM|4.0|My family enjoys good kid's movies and this one was surprisingly entertaining.  It's a little bizarre, as you might expect, but quite entertaining too.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Fun. Some great characters, especially the man played by Robert Duvall. The story has good suspense and twists, and ya gotta love the character of Jack Reacher. Good drama, some humorous moments, but also sad ones. I recommend it.
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|Well, not entirely, but many parts of the movie trumped up how great the Neve console is, only to find out Dave Grohl bought it, and considering it's a documentary BY Mr. Grohl, it seems a bit self-congratulatory. I am not an audiophile, and can't tell the difference between FLAC and a 320kbps MP3, and would venture to guess most people (back then and now a days) can't either. Yes, I prefer Miles Davis on vinyl over CD, but sound is highly subjective. What sounds good to me won't sound good to you, so the time spent talking about the Neve console meant nothing to me. I understand the difference between good sounding drums and great sounding drums, but was this studio really pumping out the greatest sounding drums?<br /><br />Nonetheless, the number of hit albums they put out is impressive. A ton of history there. I'm someone that loves listening to stories about how bands formed, got their inspiration, in-fighting, their writing and recording process, etc, and wished they focused more on that. The documentary is listed as an hour and 47 minutes, and about the last 40 minutes is footage of them writing some pretty bland music in Grohl's studio.<br /><br />Speaking of sound, the documentary itself goes from low speaking parts to VERY loud music. Just to keep from waking people I had to keep my hand on the volume knob the entire time.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Heard a lot about the book, now books; however I was not ready to read it when it first came out.  I got a preview from Amazon and I am hooked.  Can't wait for the movie to see how it compares to the book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is so addictive. I want to continue u and play this just to see all the different kind of suits it is really fun
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it.<br />Great game.<br />Good animation and fun levels. Not too difficult yet still an addicting challenge. Kindle version has macho's lair now too.

B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Its interesting but not very thrilling, it has a nice story line and it doesn't bug you with to specific tutorials.
1455526959|5.0|Best to start with Michael Connelly at the beginning of the first Harry Bosch novel and enjoy working your way up to the present as the author has some fun w/ Harry Bosch's life events; plus, you have the pleasure of learning how Bosch develops and how the author becomes one of the best in crime/mystery with a nice dose of sarcasm throughout each one!
B00BESCJII|4.0|I enjoyed this film.  Story line had some fantisy to it, but, all and all, it was an entertaining presentation.
140006922X|4.0|I just finished reading Reza Aslan's thoroughly engaging and readable book, Zealot.  Aslan uses historical documents and a close reading of biblical texts, in their original language(s), to try to ferret out a portrait of the man, Jesus of Nazareth, and to analyze how current orthodox Christian views of him came to be.  Aslan does his homework to give us a sense of what life was like in Roman-occupied Palestine, from the Roman rulers to the primacy of the Temple in Jerusalem to the lives of the laborers who struggled in an unforgiving landscape.  If we are to understand Jesus, we clearly have to understand him in the context of his place and time, and Aslan does a good job preparing and presenting his case.  If I have any criticisms, they are mainly that Aslan presents long-shot hypotheses alongside well-documented historical implications, and sometimes it's hard to tell how well supported his assertions are, at least in the main body of the book.  His notes section at the end of his book does a good job giving the academic bona fides, but it would be nice to have more of that in the text itself.  There is little in this book to antagonize Christian believers - they would do well to read this and gain a more thorough and gritty understanding of the man who became their god.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After viewing Seasons 1, 2 & 3, my wife & I can't wait for Season 4.  The production, story line, visual effects, realism and casting are all outstanding.  Season 3 ended like the old movie serials of the 40s and 50s.  &#34;Got to go to the show next Saturday to find out what happended to the hero.&#34;

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very cute and a great way to pass the time.  The minions are adorable.  The game is challenging enough and changes often enough that I do not think it will become boring.
1781162646|4.0|I attribute Stephen King to getting me to read in the first place.  Well, that and Summer School; where I was forced to sit and read and write book reports in order to get enough credits to graduate high school.  I liked the movie's that had been made out of his books and I found myself liking the books even more.  So that summer started me on a slow road to eventually what would become a lifelong reading habit.  I still sometimes go a month or so without picking up a book, but when I pick it back up I'm always glad I did.  It had been about 3 months since I read Fitzgerald's \\"This Side of Paradise\\" and I had about three 'classic lit' novels lined up that I told myself I had to read (For Whom The Bell Tolls, Catcher In The Rye, Catch 22).  I had made a good head of steam, knocking down Hemingway's first novel then Of Mice and Men then part one of Teddy Roosevelt's bio then Gatsby and Paradise.  Then I just stopped.  Sometimes you have to have a little fun when you're reading.  Not that I didn't appreciate the novels before (I enjoyed all of them except Teddy's bio), but I needed to lighten it up a bit.  Who better to lighten things up then Stephen King?  Am I right?!  Seriously, I saw he had a new book out and read how it was a lot like 'The Body' and I jumped on it.  I said all of this to say: great story, characters you care about, enough foreboding danger and mystery to keep you hooked, and that King sense of humor rings through the main characters inner monologues at just the right times.
B001RCD2DW|3.0|I debated long over friend's recommendations and reviews here on amazon between these AKG 702 headphones and Sennheiser's 650's.  I had a chance to hear the Sennheiser 650 and they were astounding.  I also had a chance to hear some AKG 701's which were likewise clean and crisp but was concerned about the lack of bass punch from them.  Nearly every review here on amazon that read like the reviewer knew what they were talking about also noted the lack of bass response in both the 701 and 702 but they all agreed that after 100 hours of break in this would no longer be an issue.  So I bit and along with the headphones I purchased Nuforce ICON-IDO DAC / Amp.  Right out of the box I loved the clarity, crispness, and perfectly clean sound at nearly every volume setting.  The highs are great.  The mids are wonderful.  The bass is missing in action.  So I tried all different styles of music for my break in period and as the first 50-75 hours went by I noticed no appreciable change in bass response.  Then I noticed one reviewer mentioned leaving the headphones plugged in and playing non-stop for 100 hours and ow wonderful the transformation was.  Ok, why not right?  So I let her run.  No change at 100 hours.  No change at 200.  No change at 300 or 400.  Ok, this is foolishness.  The headphones are nice but I'm obviously never going to get any bottom end out of them.  Just thought you should hear about it.<br /><br />Btw, of course I'll be purchasing the Sennheisers soon.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|before everyone was talking about the cloud, there was Dropbox...and I've happily used it for all my devices for over two years.  Get it!
1781162646|4.0|Overall this was a good read. The characters were likeable. The prose moved right along. The plot was interesting, but a little weak. I anticipated what was going to happen. The clairvoyant characters were a bit unbelievable. The hero was saved at the last minute in a way that was far fetched.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Just bought this app and it won't open. How does that even happen? Wasted 4.99 on nothing. Don't buy it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|if you liked the diablo sieries you will like this game great game I'm picky this game is<br />awesome. try it
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This one kept me on the edge of my seat hoping that everything woud work out well.  Even though I knew how it turns out.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I couldn't put it down . It is a must read if you love dogs it has highs and lows but the ending is great but you will need to read it to find out....
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I'm sad to be at the end of such a great saga. Well worth the time invested. Great way to end even if I don't quite understand why it had to be that way...
B001974DG0|5.0|The story line was totally believable - which made it that much more suspenseful. I love how Koontz develops the characters separately and slowly weaves them together. Koontz has been a favorite author for years and 'Watchers' reminds me why I keep going back to his books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game<br />ANYONE CAN PLAY THIS OF ALL AGES<br />it's also something that teaches you how to take care of horses.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great acting and story line!  I just hate it when someone dies! Interesting charters and sttings are beautiful! I would highly recommend the show!
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|arrived movie was ok , I mean for being a kids movie , I say wait to view it on cable
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just love this series. Each episode keeps you so absorbed that you can't wait to watch the next episode.  Love the characters & the story line, can't wait for next season!
B00819ER0Q|5.0|Ok for kids 8 and up too. Great movie worth seeing. Good for the whole family. See it at the Truman bar!
B009H8QHZS|5.0|I found this item quite by accident while watching my usual favorites on Youtube.  I was not even a fan of Jean-Jacques at the time.  Now, because of Emmanuel Moire and Merwan Rim, I have discovered the great Jean-Jacques and now I know why the French just selected him as their favorite person.  (Thank you for the link, Damien Sargue.)  This CD is enchanting because I get to hear and enjoy performers who are new to me.  The music is great, and because of this album, I now have an even longer list of performers to watch and enjoy.  My favorite songs are &#34;Au Bout de Mes Reves&#34; and &#34;Il Suffira d'Un Signe&#34; (Emmanuel and Merwan), but the entire recording is good because the singers are paired up and we get to hear amazing combinations of the best French pop has to offer.<br />I could not purchase a new CD because there were none available.  I had to get a used CD which is in excellent condition.  If you can get a copy, get it now.  Don't wait, because you will be deprived of a great listening experience if you don't.  There is a second CD which will be available in France soon.  I HOPE AMAZON DOESN'T KEEP US WAITING FOR IT!  As for this album, buy, buy, buy!  Achetez, achetez, achetez!  Compre, compre, compre!
0763619612|5.0|Got this at the library and read it to my six year-old three days ago. We both loved it so much! I haven't been able to get the story off my mind. It's a beautifully simple and inspiring gem.
B00BSBUZT6|3.0|Good stuff overall, though it's a bit too much from the eyes of Frey and Henley; that can kind of warp the issues that took place involving Frey-Meisner, Frey-Leadon, and Frey-Felder. ...but I'll still watch it again and again.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Started out kinda interesting, kinda peculiar, and very much a teen romantic drama.  It never got boring, but I would've liked more sci-fi and less romance.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Although the ending just killed me it just had to be that way.  I hope this was not based on a true story.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love all the properness of these people. And then the moden twist of lime on the story makes it addicted.
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|Loved this book more than any I've read this summer! It's is truly a fun read that keeps you guessing the whole way.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I recommend  this app for every late sleeper, it does every thing it sages it does. Best digital alarm clock that is free. The good thing is that it's not a dime out of your pocket :-) . Best alarm app of the modern age B-) .
B00C1S9G90|3.0|This is not really a great season by itself, but it has some really stellar episodes like &#34;Measure of a man&#34; and &#34;A matter of honor&#34;.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Great book, easy read, Offers an in depth look at the Lincoln presidency and the advisers who shaped his presidency
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|For a series a series as epic as the wheel of time has become, it has become nearly impossible to tie up everything with a pretty little bow.  I wonder what kind of a book Jordan would have produced with his own hands, but even with all of its flaws I think he would be happy with the final result.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the rest of the books, I see no real reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one except for maybe the fact that it is the end.  Of course, it is the wheel of time and things have a way of coming back around.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it. I've been playing it for over a year and I am still not bored with it. It keeps me going with different levels.
0553801473|5.0|Loved it, was great. As always he is a wonderful story teller, and competely wraps you up in his imagations! His charactors are so believable and you become so ingrossed in the story its like you are really there. Love his work!
B005T87QCI|5.0|just like in the movie you have to move up the ranks and become the unbeatable robot. awesome game. i seriously recomend tjis
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|To be fair I never did get to play this game. Although the I downloaded it, uninstalled it when it wouldn't work and downloaded it a second time, it would never even open for more that 3 seconds, so uninstalled it after a few hours of trying to get it to work.<br />Its probably a great game for all I know.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|First of all it's easy to figure out and use as soon as you download it. I use it mostly to keep track of my doctors appointments. Very handy to keep with you when visiting the docs office so your next appointment does not occur on the same date of something else you have planned. Memo to self, grocery list, reminders, anything you wish to use this app for you can do it and keep all your notes very tidy. I love this app and so will you!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I've enjoyed playing this game very much. It can be challenging yet not too difficult to come up with the necessary clues to escape from the room. I highly recommend this app. Give it a try.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I got this book because a member of my book club chose it.  She did not tell us much about the book.  I am getting close to the end, and I have loved Harold's journey.  Some parts have brought tears to my eyes.  I would rate it a nine and a half on a ten point scale.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Emma Stone & Ryan Gosling are the best part of this movie, and they are the co-stars. It's about a lonely depressed man who is so pathetic after his wife leaves him that a stud in his local bar (Gosling) takes pity on him and helps him reinvent himself. There are sub-currents to the characters which are nice. These characters are interspersed throughout the film and it has a really nice reveal about 3/4 thru it<br /><br />I did NOT enjoy the message to young men and boys that was delivered through Steve Carell's 'son' about persistence (and stalking) being what you need to do in order to 'win' the love of your life - especially if the she in question is totally not on board with the idea. It was creepy and inappropriate.<br /><br />Bottom line - enjoyable, especially for Stone & Gosling fans. Be ready to cringe through creepy scenes.
B00821OX98|3.0|Story is not that exciting while acting is very poor.  The worst problem with falling skies is the lack of character s.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Excellent show! A lot of the stories within each episode are similar but there is an overall story that continues to more forward that has both of us hooked.
B0091REZMW|3.0|after a while it's boring, not much to do playing this game excepted more, only played it for 1-2 days and removed the application
B0016BP0PW|5.0|If you are a Beatles Fan you must have this. It is a film adaptation of some of the Beatles best tune. It is sung by different artists but they do a fantastic job.  Highly recommend this film
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It doesn't let me download and half the time it would act up or just freeze up and quit on me
B001ER4CNY|4.0|When I came across this Complete Series Box Set on Amazon, I was a fairly new member of the I Dream of Jeannie fan club. Just before I ordered this set, I had scarcely seen some reruns on TV and watched a few episodes online.<br /><br />I Dream of Jeannie dropped onto the TV landscape on September 18, 1965 on NBC-TV. This outlandish fantasy-aimed situation comedy was created upon the success of Bewitched, a ABC fantasy, that debuted on September 17, 1964 and had already became the #2 series on TV. I Dream of Jeannie followed the story of a 2,000-year-old genie named Jeannie (Barbara Eden) and astronaut Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman), who meet on a deserted island after Tony's space shuttle crashes. There, he finds a bottle and accidentally lets a foreign-speaking Jeannie out of the bottle. Unbeknownst to Tony, when his rescue crew comes, Jeannie returns to her bottle and places it his bag. When he gets home, Tony discovers Jeannie and their zany misadventures begin. Throughout the rest of the series are Major Roger Healy (Bill Daily), Colonel Dr. Alfred Bellows (Hayden Rorke), and his wife Amanda Bellows (Emmaline Henry).<br /><br />Although not as popular as Bewitched with audiences or critics, I Dream of Jeannie did have a great deal of controversy. Censors haunted production sets because of Barbara Eden's risqu&eacute; two-piece Jeannie Costume. NBC also worried about the concept of the series: a Jeannie willing to do literally \\"anything\\" for her master. The series went on to have five moderately successful seasons, and from 1965 to 1970, the series was a critical mockery. In the fifth season, when NBC executives only renewed the series unless Jeannie and Tony were married, the show became stupid. Jeannie was unrealistic from the beginning... she was fake. She was a fantasy. How does someone like that get married? They don't. Season five was definitely not the best of the show.<br /><br />As for the box set this series comes in, it looks okay. It's plastic. Mine wastore in some spots and replaced with some cheap tape. The bottle is really nice and looks good, but the DVD holder (20 DVDs) is flimsy and mine was torn on both ends. Also included is a nice box with logo cards (or trading cards or some sort) from all five seasons. They have nice little information and some rare pictures on them. For the price, this set is really not worth it. There is a re-boxing of the complete series coming out in just a few months and the going price is like $35. I'd say buy that. I have not seen any pictures of it yet, but it is supposed to better than this one, especially because all the complaints this one has gotten from fans. Not too satisfying. Wait for the new release.
B00CO52NLI|3.0|after a while it's boring, not much to do playing this game excepted more, only played it for 1-2 days and removed the application
B008673ZAQ|3.0|After reading Fifty Shades I had a hard time getting into this one. It was just ok.Maybe if I read it first.
B004MC0FO8|3.0|It's a good application for when you are trying to figure out a song on television, or on movies and other television series
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|The movie had good action in it, but being an avid fan of the book I was disappointed that some things were left out while other things were added. The book is not long enough to make 3 movies, and it did seem to drag at times.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I am still playing this game, it's a good game for people who like to play different farming games or just like farm games
B004SVM7BW|1.0|Sorry that is not ok. I don't give such vital info to apps. Required internet access as well? Just to operate? There are better apps that are less intrusive and do the job much better.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Does what it says took me a lot of application searching before I found one that cleaned like it should instead of only cleans half
B008M87GJK|4.0|Helpful app to catch BBC news especially the important headlines.  The categories make it easy to use.  I recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good for people who love to play card games or just the solitare card games like I do, and you don't need internet to play it
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I was having a blast with this game until today. When I started the game it did a download and now the game won't go past the loading screen. I tried to uninstall and then reload...same thing, can't get past the loading screen.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Please add me need more friends ID Number is DKFCFJS just wish I can sync Facebook anyone have any suggestion..
1592402690|5.0|A Brilliant autobiographical recap of Geoff Emerick's engineering of the Beatles starting from when he was 15 for She Loves You as assistant engineer to Revolver, Sgt. Peppers, Magical Mystery Tour and Abbey Road where he was the lead engineer.  If you want to know the technical overview of these sessions, you will be intrigued by the detail of who played what and how the sounds were created.  Plus his insight into the personalities of the four Beatles is never sycophant like and an honest representation of the total person.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This was a fast-paced, exciting and informative book.  The antagonist was both very likeable and unlikeable, but extremely complex and exciting.  At times you feel as if he is the protagonist, then he is a definite villain, capable of unspeakable atrocities.  The book moves so quickly, I couldn't put it down and read it in a weekend,  Then I was sad it ended.  I am absolutely in love with Ken Follett books and am reading them so fast, that I don't know what to do with myself until I order another one of his books.  I'm really looking forward to his third installment of the twentieth century novels.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|. Glad i got it for free. Would love to play more like this. Pretty good game. Loooove the storyline. Excited to finish. Pretty used story basis though
B000OIZUW6|4.0|This was a fun, fast-paced novel, although it was fairly unbelievable in several places.  Again, Follett gives us a great antagonist in Dieter Franck.  He's definitely an narcissistic, self-obsessed bully, but his reluctance before he tortures and his migraines after he tortures give him some complexity.  Also, the fact that he really seems to love Stephanie and his wife and children add to his often ironic nature.  However, for the most part, he is a villain with no conscience.  Flick, the protagonist, is primarily likeable and believable except for her apparent &#34;love&#34; for Michel and her instantaneous love of Paul--a bit of a stretch.  The plot is fast-paced and exciting, although at times fairly unbelievable.  Again, it was informative and inspires interest in many aspects of WWII.  I liked the novel; it was a fun read.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|The best thing in this movie is Rupert Penry-Jones (LOL!).  The female lead was a disappointment.  She was neither attractive, particularly intelligent or spunky. In fact, she was rather mousy.  Why the Captain would ever be interested in her is beyond me.  The older unmarried sister acted more like a snooty mother than a sister, more like a wife to the father.  Casting just was too off, didn't ring true.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's fun and simple. No bells or whistles, just challenging puzzles to keep the gears in my head constantly in motion.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|Richard Armitage is the best thing in this video (LOL!).  I would have given it 5 stars except that I wasn't particularly impressed by the \\"heroine\\".  She didn't seem to be particularly beautiful, spunky, or smart.  She seems to be mostly impulsive without common sense.  I haven't read the book so I don't know if that is the way she really is in the book, or if the actress portrayed her that way.  Also, I love the music too!
B000001DQI|5.0|One of all time favorites. Still know every lyric by heart. In my opinion Elton John's masterpiece. Right up there with Beatles White Album
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie is worth watching and was well done; however it doesn't compare to the book.  I guess the problem with movies is that it is hard to capture all the detail you get in a book.  Read the book because there is so much left out in the movie.  If you didn't read the book first you would probably not really understand half of what was going on in the movie.  By the way I didn't realize this at first but this is a trilogy - a total of 3 books.
B00E0ZEDI6|5.0|I have been an Owl City fan for about 3 or more years, and every album or single he has released never fails to amaze me! Every song he creates is incredibly awesome! This EP is no exception! The brand-new songs, Hey Anna and I Hope You Think Of Me, are very catchy and have phenomenal lyrics/tune. And the three revised acoustic versions of Good Time, Shooting Star and Gold are wonderful. This album is extremely well done and the acoustic songs in particular, are exceptionally well put together and I think he has done a great job changing them into softer, more low-key songs filled with piano and strings. Buy this EP! And if your a fan of Owl City, I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It tells me what the weather will be.  I wish they hadn't changed the appearance, but I got used to it.  Good app for weather.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I really like this game. I wish they would of started us off with more game coins but there easy to earn so no bugs.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I can count on one hand the movies I'd consider good that I've seen recently in theaters. And I'd consider this one to be better than just good.<br /><br />Here's a run down of the movie without spoiling anything: Carolyn and Roger Perron move into a Rhode Island home with their 5 daughters in 1971. First bruises appear out of no where, clocks stop, weird smells occur and everything quickly gets worse. As the situation progressively gets worse Carolyn attends a class where Ed and Lorraine Warren are teaching and explaining what they do and about the paranormal. Carolyn seeks their help and has them come to her home to see if they can rid her family and home of this dark presence. The Warrens discover this to be their most difficult and horrifying case.<br /><br />The film is based on a true story which alone makes it that much more frightening. There's no gore, nudity, and honestly I can't remember any swearing either. So a film being rated R for purely the scare factor should peak your interest.<br /><br />The acting was great. Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren, Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren, and Lili Taylor as Carolyn Perron were the shining stars. The rest of the cast including the daughters all did great also.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing more than once. Go watch it!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Great job They arrived earlier than expected and works wonderfully the online process was easy and it was reliable. I would recommend this replacement item if you need it  The replacement was easy to install
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am glad this was rated high. I love the challenge. Just hard enough to play and not get frustrated.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Have read before several times. Will read again in the future. Classics are always a good read, especially when free on Kindle.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Love this on my phone.... I have learned the more precise meanings of words by being able to look them up immediately!

B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Nice to have the original mix on the drums, the remastered versions are horrible, the packaging is a little flimsy, but otherwise a good product
B009EDZ5RW|4.0|Really enjoyed watching this! I would definitely recommend to anyone else. It kept me and my family entertained for the entire movie.
B0092W59VW|5.0|I like it.  It is good.  sounds nice. Not too shabby dude.  Buy this.  It is a good idea.  OK?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun like every one can rate rate that its fun try it its really fun and challengeing
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is one of the great detectives in this genera.  He's defective, has his own demons and nightmares, but his personal moral code keeps him working to do the right thing.  He disregards politics and other distractions, and keeps working for the victims.  Each book is a treasure.  I can't wait for Michael's next tale!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is so cute.In the begging of the game lt insplanes how it starts. also if you get enophon bannanas you can get the baby cosoum.
B001XUH69Y|4.0|Color aside we would have loved it except for the corny saying (when an aging Bogart would toast a young Bergman) &#34;here's looking at you kid&#34;---
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Superb effects, outstanding cast. The storyline was easy to follow and I am grateful for the future movies that are in the future.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I have been a professional artist for 20 years but  I wanted to try working in a different media. I have all the supplies, a place to work and lots of ideas but I just couldn't make myself start experimenting. I had all kinds of reasons not to start even though I didn't recognize my avoidance behaviors until I started reading this book. I started reading it one evening and by the next morning I was working on the paintings I wanted to try doing, and they looked pretty darn good. I also recognized similar avoidance behaviors in a couple of of friends and recommend they try this book as well, after some nagging each person bought the book and reported back that after reading it it had helped them get started on projects they had been wanting to tackle but had not gotten around to starting. None of these other people are artists, and none of their projects were art related, so  this shows this book helps non artists as well. For me beginning to work on the paintings I had been thinking about for so long also had the added effect of washing away the deep feelings of guilt and depression I had been experiencing for a long time. I have been much more productive and happier in the months since I started reading this book. Thank You Mr Pressfield.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game kept me going for hours.  it was very challenging. I could not put it down. I'm looking forward to another game like this
B0082FPIY8|5.0|Cheryl is my number one writer. She is funny and tell the story in a way that you walk the trial with her.
0064430170|5.0|A classic childhood book that my daughter grew up with and wanted for her children. Happy to find it on amazon for a good price.
B00506NRBS|5.0|I am running to bed to night to read further. Unfortunately I had to stop reading this morning, otherwise I would have finished it by now.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Everything she touches is great!  Lots of useful advice...I would add, however, that its crucial to be a little cautious about what you lean into.  Not everything is or even should be a free-for-all
B00AM7E4LM|4.0|One do not want to learn new things because it might take t long. With this guidance anything can be learned in less time
B005PK57IK|4.0|We like the characters and the twists and turns of the story. It is like viewing &#34;behind the scene&#34; of how lawyers think and work.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Can't wait for the movie now that I finished the book. I got the book so I can read it before the movie.
B00CDY6HW6|1.0|I do not recommend this game for adults.  It is quite elementary and will hold the interest for a 5 year old child.
B00969PR18|4.0|This app is very like the app on my cell phone so it was very easy to pick up & use.  The maps are bigger on the kindle therefore easier to see when I am directing my husband.
0312611692|4.0|It's a good summary of the major trends of civilization both east and west. He writes well manages to write with a degree of intellectual precision and clarity without sounding intentionally academic. Though his premise is weak (basically it is all about geography) he makes a good stab at a &#34;compare and contrast&#34; between East and West and why the West has been ahead for so long. Worth reading for a quick summary of world history. It is interesting to note that this is one in a long line of recent works that have tried to explain why the West has been so dominant in world civilization. No one seems to have got it exactly right. &#34;It's complicated&#34; or something to that effect seems to say it best.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun.  Not too easy, not too . My 7 year kept asking, mom can we finish playing that really cool clue game.  Then my 9 year old said, now we can do it together mom.  Sure, since II don't remember where most of the objects are hidden.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is such a great game. It is so addicting and play it all the time. I would TOTALLY recommend this app to anyone. S fun game that you could play for hours without getting bored.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Extraordinary account of the surreal life in the North Korean communist hell. A quasi realistic description of every day life in the PRNK, the oppression of the omnipresent propaganda machine and the universal accommodation to corruption, lies and horror. Masterly written.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Been listening to it constantly for about two weeks - still lovin' it!  My favorite is Shadows...  Highly recommend this album from a wonderfully talented young woman!

B004CEUEWE|5.0|Is was a excellent moive lot of action. Great  actors and story line.Kept  me on the edge of my seat
B0018BB21G|5.0|Moody Blues are argumentatively one of the finest groups to come out of the 60s.  Sure, there'll always be diehard Beatles fans and diehard Rolling Stones fans, but look at them.  Half the Beatles are dead and half the members of the Rolling Stones could be mistaken as dead by even a coroner.  However, I'm not here to bash either as both have put out good music.<br /><br />The Moody Blues, as a group, had a very nice and timely evolution.  Much like the Beatles, they dabbled into alternative sounds from their core beginnings.  Consider: Moody Blues had a bluesy/jazzy feel from the start.  The Beatles were mainstream pop.  Both went on to define themselves as leaders of their genre.<br /><br />Reaching #5 in the UK and a lower #23 in the US while spawning one US and two UK radio hits, In Search of the Lost Chord has some of my favorite Moodies cuts.  As this was a concept album, the broad theme was a journey and eventual discovery.  Doctor Livingston, I Presume, one of two Ray Thomas' songs from the original release, jauntingly speaks of finding the wonderful doctor &#34;...stepping out from the jungle gloom, into the mid-day sun&#34;.  Ride My See-Saw, one of John Lodge's contributions, is a fast paced, nearly psychedelic trip seamlessly blended into Graeme Edge's Departure.<br /><br />In Search of the Lost Chord allowed all members of the Moody Blues to stretch out and contribute their singular works into a collective knowledge of music.  Long live the Moody Blues.
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|Lot of action great actors Love all the actors and it kept me in supense through the hold movie.  And I plan on buying so I can watch it over again
B0018BB20W|5.0|One of the great things about the Moody Blues is they've never released a subpar album.  Days of Future Passed's cut Nights in White Satin is probably known worldwide.<br /><br />The album stands fast as a true modern classic.  Breaking from their namesake blues heritage, the MB's fused classic music into a modern setting.<br /><br />\\"Breathe deep, the gathering gloom...\\"<br />Thank you gents, for decades of awesomeness.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick Riordan keeps the excitement flowing as well as defines the characters so you're really rooting for them to succeed. Plus, with prophecies yet to be fulfilled, he leaves you hungry for the next book.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game.  I loved it.  Really fun and engaging. Great graphic. I liked the story line a lot. Can not wait to play the game some more.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I thought this was a decent, but predictable movie. Never read the books, but just was expecting a little more for the time I spent watching, but I guess I've watched worse, so what can you do?
B00E8B1358|1.0|One of the worst movies ever!!!  A total waste of my money!!  Plenty of good action films out there, this isn't one of them!
B007VDN1PA|3.0|Of course I wasn't expecting photolab-quality scanning from a device so small and inexpensive, but I'm a little mixed about the results I've been getting.  It does indeed do what it promises: it scans slides and film quickly and simply, and the results are decent.  If you mostly want to have easier access to images you have on slides, this will certainly help you get useable results, more than acceptable for casual use.<br /><br />However,  the focus is often a little soft, it varies from slide-to-slide, and there's no way to adjust that.  Similarly, the backlighting is a little hard to get right: there IS a menu setting to increase or decrease the brightness, which helps, but it's often tricky to find a setting that doesn't blow-out the highlights, or lose shadow detail. The default is fine for most cases, but be aware that you may need to make tweaks for some images.  Colors are a little over-soaked too. A few thicker glass-mounted slides were a challenge to get in and out of the slot...<br /><br />If you just need to efficiently transfer old slides into a format that easier to share, this will definitely do the job, and the images will  be good enough for casual viewing. But if you're looking to get sharp, balanced, fine-grained image files, especially if you want to make large-ish prints, you might still need to take them to a professional lab, or be ready to drop lots of money on a Nikon, or other high-end film scanner.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|It takes a lot of hubris to make a sequel to a beloved classic. It takes even more skill to craft something remotely worthy of such a classic. I think of the novels Scarlett, a sequel to Gone With the Wind, and Cosette, a sequel to Les Miserables, and shudder. The news of a film prequel to The Wizard of Oz struck me as a blow to fond memories of a childhood classic. I was completely uninterested and ready to write it off until I found out the director's name--Sam Raimi.<br /><br />Raimi is famous for directing the Tobey Maguire Spider-man movies, though he has had a long history of horror, fantasy, drama, and comedy film making. Often, all in the same film. He has a distinctive and imaginative style. If anyone could pull off another Oz movie, it would be him....or Stephen Spielberg.<br /><br />Oz the Great and Powerful tells how Oscar Diggs came from a traveling circus in Kansas to the land of Oz. He runs a magic show for the carnival and wants to be a great flimflam artist but he can't make it to the big time. He tells a girl in Kansas who wants to marry him that he doesn't want to be a good man, he wants to be a great man. She wants a good man but he's not interested in small town life. After his fateful balloon ride, Diggs is mistaken for the prophesied wizard who will defeat the wicked witch and become the just and benevolent ruler of the land of Oz. Diggs is, of course, no wizard, but he is a man of great ambition, and the fabulous wealth of Oz is a great temptation to him.<br /><br />The story follows a rather predictable arc, especially for anyone who has seen the original film. Nevertheless, the movie is full of invention and visual splendor, perfectly suited to Raimi's cinematic style.The actors are fairly good, though James Franco as Oz gives only an adequate performance in what should be a star-making larger-than-life role. It is a devilish hard mark to hit and I don't know who would have done a better job blending the ambition and the heart that are required for the role.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is a joy to watch and I am sad that I didn't see it in the theater in its full glory. I watched it on a plane and want to watch it again on a bigger screen with better sound. It's not a classic but it is fun and might grow more charming with repeat viewings.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a series that I never expected to love, but I do.  Sometimes the plots get a little soap opera but instead of so-and-so is in a coma or so-and-so slept with a married woman, it is hey he totally got shanked or he totally cheated and slept with that porn stripper.  It is a whole bunch of fun and the acting is pretty good too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a very moving tribute to the Afghans we never have a chance to meet. Hosseini writes with his heart while he captures ours.
0345529057|5.0|Started reading Game of Thrones after watching the first couple of episodes of the HBO series. Although, the series is really good, the books are better. The writing is amazing and really provides so much depth and history to many and more characters.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|For some reason I was never previously a Boston fan. Over the last couple years I occasionally heard some of their songs and really liked them so I decided to pick up this album. I was amazed to find that every song on the CD was a winner. Sure, there's 3 or 4 that are truly great but the others are still songs I will listen to again. I don't think I ever bought any album before, greatest hits included, where I enjoyed each included track. This is an amazing album. The included notes on the bands history were also an unexpected treat.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Thoughtful and enlightening. A clear-eyed, clear-headed work that demonstrates how history and faith routinely collide and how, unfortunately, faith often prevails. 'Zealot' is a strong and much needed addition to the cannon of religious history.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The story was very enjoyable, and the author brings the characters to life.  I was sorry to see this end
B0052AC8C6|4.0|This was a cute weird movie...Johnny Depp is funny and funky as Rango.  It also has a good story line in this western.
B00AXIZ5WC|5.0|If you are interested in, grow, or simply marvel at carnivorous plants and only have room for one book .... this is the one to get. The author writes from experience in an easy to understand fashion. The book is fully illustrated with large crisp images. It could easily become a coffee table book sensation.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like how it alerts you on the kindle even when you are not using  the kindle. A severe marine warning alert saved me from going out into the gulf recently.  I very highly recommend this weather app.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved it as much as the first season!!! Can't wait till the third season!!! I liked the ending better this go around and I've fallen in love with Amazons instant video
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Not what I expected, but very good still. I never read the Harry Potter series, but I would say it is comparable to books of this genre.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!! Definitely have to have tissues handy when reading this, but well worth it. It is an amazing story that I think anyone could appreciate. Well worth the time and money!!!!!!!!
B004SVM7BW|3.0|This app can do almost anything for you on your PDFs and is quite simple to use. The EULA is a bit overzealous although I think this is because the developer used default EULA statements. The required permissions are pretty offending, but unlike what others said, you are not required to have internet access to open a PDF.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|greT game. love that more than one player can play. my kids enjoy games on my kindle. only bad thing lots of talking and first chapter is hard. i like that the games are not timed so yku can take your time.

B008JFUPPI|3.0|Nick (Ryan Reynolds) a slightly dirty cop dies early in the film. In the afterlife he is teamed up with Roy (Jeff Bridges) an old western marshal. Together they cruise Boston looking for &#34;deados,&#34; people who are dead, but somehow missed getting caught up in the vortex because &#34;the system wasn't designed for the heavy volume.&#34;<br /><br />The plot, inane as it was, had some good MIB potential. Indeed they did spend money on special effects. The main problem was that the main characters were more annoying than entertaining, especially Bridges who down right prated on my nerves. Reynolds didn't impress and neither did his mousy wife (Stephanie Szostak). Kevin Bacon did what he could with his role. The characters and dialouge had no hook. Mary-Louise Parker had some snarky lines, but wasn't on the screen long enough.<br /><br />Worth a rental, but not much more.<br /><br />Parental Guide: Near f-bomb. No sex or nudity.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!! It is totally addictive and fun. I hate to put it down, but life goes on.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Based on a true story, the film opens with an incident in which Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren explain the difference between ghosts and demonic possession, both being similar to owning cats. Ed has a room full of artifacts that would make \\"Riley's Believe it or Not\\" museum green with envy. Hey don't touch the monkey!<br /><br />Meanwhile the Perron family has moved into a house in Harrisville, RI, in 1971 BF (before flashlights). They discover their basement door has been boarded over, because God knows spirits can't pass through wood. The Perron family has a pack of screaming daughters, just right for a horror flick.<br /><br />Needless to say the plot and subplot come together with wonderfully horrific results. Like most films the creepiness builds to a climax. This particular film has some minor religious overtones to it as one would expect with an exorcism type production. Good film to watch in the dark. Take the kids. Zombie soundtrack.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. WARNING: Does use the word \\"groovy\\" and \\"The Brady Bunch\\" is on TV in the background.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because it just like temple run. And I love that game the game is so great I love it
B009GX69RK|5.0|I started watching season 1 on netflix and love it! season 2 is just as good and I'm in love with the characters!
0345803507|5.0|The last book in the trilogy and it lives up to the first two which is unusual.  It was a great story, an easy read and with characters that you cared about after reading the first two books.  A wonderful ending to a fantastic love story,
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I highly recommend! Good for hours and hours of fun. Easy to get upgrades and master levels Come on for free you have nothing to lose<br />Invite your friends for more fun
0345803493|5.0|Great story, characters that are unique and different and whom you come to care about and start to actually root for them to make it in their quest for true love.
6303014100|1.0|This is a brilliant movie. However something must be wrong with the winding of the tape on the spool. At times there was no picture and at times the picture was fuzzy. I think the tape was not wound tightly and thus we got either no picture or a poor picture. About 1/2 hour into the film, the picture got better. As I think about it, I should have purchased the dvd version instead of the vcr.
0345803485|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised by this book, especially after reading and hearing about all the hype it caused last summer.  Usually a book doesn't live up to the wonderful things written and said about it but this one not only lived up to it but actually surpassed anything I knew beforehand.  Completely new and different characters from all the other books I've read and if there is any criticism about the hype, it's that the book was 'sexually explicit' which it was but not without a reason that the author tied into the story seamlessly.  All three books are a must-read.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I just love this movie. I can watch it a thousand times!  Really fun to watch and sing along. Two thumbs up.
1451695195|5.0|Excellent story of a neurosurgeon who becomes critically ill and has a NDE (near-death experience) which is not a new concept but is told in a very compelling story.  Having read many books on this subject, in my opinion, this one was definitely the best because he explains the afterlife in so much detail.  In addition, the fact that he was a total non-believer in this phenomena made the book that much more interesting because when this happened to him he had no preconceived notions of what to expect.  If you like this subject you will love this book.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Guy Clark....... Maybe the first song I remember hearing EVER was Homegrown Tomatoes. I have never looked back. Has to be on of the greatest songwriters to ever put pen to paper. Now before anyone says his voice is a little strained and cracked....... The man is 71 years old and he has lived more than most of us can imagine.<br /><br />My favorite picture of you.  Incredible!!! Songs are fresh with a hint of the old days.  Have listened to  the disc several times and find a little something new every time. Five stars all the way. Not a bad song on the disc.<br /><br />Guy doesn't tour much these days but if you get a chance to see the man live do it . There are so few of these legends left don't miss the opportunity.
0446547646|3.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks book that I was sorry I paid for because I could have gotten any of his books out of the local library and read the same story only with different characters.  Not worth the money, wait until your library has the book or it's on sale at a garage sale.
B005O64VH8|5.0|It is great music, but one problem is when I set it up on my IPod it separates the music that has more than one writers.
1885167776|5.0|This book is about finding your focus and making it your top priority. Identifying your focus comes from asking The Focusing Question: \\"What's the ONE Thing you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?\\"<br /><br />\\"The Focusing Question is a double-duty question. It comes in two forms: big picture and small focus. One is about finding the right direction in life and the other is about finding the right action.\\"<br /><br />The Focusing Question can be tiered to link short-term actions with long-term goals. Keller and Papasan refer to this as lining up your dominoes.  Based on your long-term goal, what's the one thing you can do in the next five years? Based on your five-year goal, what's the one thing you can do in the next year? In the next month? This week? Today? \\"Think big--but go small.\\"<br /><br />We've all heard of the 80/20 rule. \\"If disproportionate results come from one activity, then you must give that one activity disproportionate time... This is how results become extraordinary.\\"<br /><br />The authors recommend spending the entire morning on your one thing. Use the afternoon for everything else. They point to venture capitalist Paul Graham as an example. \\"Graham divides all work into two buckets: maker (do or create) and manager (oversee or direct)... Graham embraced this insight and created a company culture at Y Combinator that now runs completely on a maker's schedule. All meetings get clustered at the end of the day.\\"<br /><br />An accountability partner can improve your productivity. \\"Just knowing they are waiting for your next progress report can spur you to better results.\\" The book cites psychology professor Gail Matthews, who found that professionals with written goals were 39.5 percent more likely to accomplish them, while those \\"who wrote their goals and sent progress reports to friends were 76.7 percent more likely to achieve them.\\"<br /><br />The book debunks the myth of multitasking. \\"You can do two things at once, but you can't focus effectively on two things at once.\\" Quoting Stanford professor Clifford Nass, \\"Multitaskers were just lousy at everything.\\"<br /><br />The book also debunks the myth of a balanced life. \\"The reason we shouldn't pursue balance is that the magic never happens in the middle; magic happens at the extremes... The question of balance is really a question of priority. When you change your language from balancing to prioritizing, you set your choices more clearly and open the door to changing your destiny.\\"<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a review copy of this book.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|First, it should be said that the style this book is written in will not appeal to everyone.  As someone once said of the works of Trollope, it's &#34;for patient readers over 30.&#34;  For that reader, though, it's a tour de force, and will be in print 200 years from now, whatever form &#34;in print&#34; may take.  Its tale of obsession, fanaticism and single-minded revenge is both gripping and chilling, and the ingenious literary device of telling the story not by a participant nor an omniscient narrator, but by a close witness speaking to a more distant one, conveys all the horror without directly threatening the reader.  The ending was not to me satisfying, but I frankly can't imagine a better one.  If this classic has previously escaped you, as it had me, correct that forthwith!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best show on television. Every season just keeps getting better and better!!  I Can't wait until next season.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I didn't expect a basic RTS like this to be so addictive, but I haven't been able to stop playing.

1596177373|5.0|These were a early birthday gift for a close friend and they thoroughly enjoyed them! Will get more for gifts.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We love watching well-written television series. Just like reading a good book, there's nothing more satisfying than immersing ourselves in a good story brought to screen... and pleasurable to watch as streaming, without dealing with inane advertisements.<br /><br />The Good Wife has great actors in complex roles with interesting plot twists. Highly recommend! We just completed Season One, and looking forward to Season Two.
B00ALGW286|5.0|I loved this coming of age story set during Russia's perestroika period. Author Julia Gousseva writes with the confident hand of someone who witnessed the events up close. Everything is here from the turbulent period in Russian history, from the opening of a new McDonalds in Moscow to the rumblings of tanks as the Eastern bloc started to collapse and fragment into revolution, all told through the eyes of a teenage girl thirsting to see the world. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good coming of age story and is interested in all things Russian.
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|If you are an action movie guy, this is a MUST HAVE for you.<br />I suggest to see GI Joe 1 first to understand the secuence but the action and the spectation is on the desired level, just don't pretend to see the movie with your wife, girlfriend or some girl, they will not understand the action, the fights or the adrenaline you spend during the movie.<br />This is as I said, agreat movie for action guys and If you can, se it on 3D for an excellent movie evening at home.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|The landscape, movement, animation, it's all so beautiful should've brought a poet to explain it better, the whole thing is just perfect: 10/10

B008476HBM|5.0|My daughter was sitting here watching one of her tv shows and the teens on it were talking about reading Pride and Prejudice for school.  My child hasn't had to read it for school but said she wants to read it so we looked on Amazon and found the Kindle Edition FREE.  I love that there are these classics available for FREE!  Thanks Amazon!  Getting all the FREE available books for Kindle makes the Kindle pay for itself through the past 3 years!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good story couldn't put it down. Would recommend to all romance readers. The author did very well writing this story
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I played the game during the course of a day & then the next day all I could do was get it to want $$$ from me! I deleted it from the Kindle @ that point - not a FREE app!
B000I9WW6I|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie over the years, but I love it each time. The acting is superb, and the story line is so good. I, recently, made a trip down to Whistle Stop, and it was so much fun to see. I came back, ordered the movie, and enjoyed every minute of it.
B000P0J09W|5.0|A \\"classic\\" children's movie great for the whole family. Fun, exciting, funny, and adventuresome. This movie has a good storyline and some great acting by the cast. A must see!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I really never watched this show on CBS Sunday evenings but since I started watching it on Amazon Video I could not stop. Maybe it is because of the commercials on regular TV but one thing for sure I went through all 3 seasons (22 episodes each) in under 3 weeks. Now I need to try and watch Season 4 before Season 5 starts in September. This show is FANTASTIC. It just mesmerizes you. As soon as 1 episode is over you almost have to start watching the next episode. Just when you think that the 2nd or 3rd episode is dealing with new story lines the 4th episode brings back stories from the first and second episodes.<br />Touché to the Producers and Script Writers.<br />Touché to Juliana Marguiles and the entire cast, and most important, thank you Amazon for giving me Amazon Video.

B001EYK54W|4.0|Why waste time with recent schlock cinema, when you can go with a tried and true period piece. If you haven't seen it, do so...
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I wish I would have read the book first, it was amazing. Both the book and the movie were well written.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This BBC show is a wonderful series about hardships and friendships in the small town of Candleford and in the nearby farming community of Lark Rise.<br />Admittedly, I was not much impressed with the first episode, but continued watching none the less and soon got drawn into the quiet but engaging story lines around Dorcas Lane, Laura Timmins, Alf, Thomas Brown, Twister and Queenie... To name a few of the main characters.<br /><br />This beautiful TV series provides good family entertainment without the violence and distractions other series often resort to. I thoroughly enjoyed season 1, 2 & 3and will continue on with season 4. Sadly, there is no season 5.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|This game sucks. I used to love uno as a kid but not anymore. It's pretty much set up for the computer to win. It's like every computer game it cheats.  You will consider redoing this game or u will suffer the consequences. Period end of story.
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|this is great from start to finish.  it never gets old and you can watch it over and over.  this is a classic
0307895505|5.0|I love the detail that they put into making this book. I covered so so much. 25% of the core content I missed but this book helped me see the game with a new set of eye's. Information is power, and this book is powerful!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I saw all of the great reviews for the game so I thought I would give it a shot. I learned that it doesn't work l properly on my Kindle Fire. Highly disappointed. Looked like it would be fun.

B009WUAK2M|5.0|Saw Expendables 1.  Loved it.  Expendables 2, more of the same.  This was just great non-stop action.  And after watching #1,<br />you know the good guys are going to win.<br />This movie is a blast!  You don't have too much deep thinking in this movie, just a lot of good guys kicking bad guys butts.<br />Watch this movie for what it is and you will have a good time.<br /><br />chuck
B009NY43NY|3.0|It seemed to me that the ending book was rushed and did not really pull together all that had happened to the citizens of Bon Temps. It certainly left me still wanting more of Sookie and crew, so maybe there are future books that would bring the vamps, Werewolves and other &#34;supes&#34; back into play.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was an awesome read. The romantic element really helped the flow and all of the eroticism has been interesting.
B00127RAJY|5.0|While I cannot attest to physical changes in my body (did not weigh or measure myself before and after - you should though!) I can definitely say that I enjoyed it. While there were times when I found myself yelling at Jillian because I knew what was coming next and struggled with it (specifically the chair squat with a V raise) it goes by quickly and before you know it, you're on circuit 3 and it's over for that day!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was skeptical about all the Downton Abbey hype, I was wrong. I watched all 3 seasons in a week. Can't wait for season 4.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I have a movie library of over 500 titles and this is among the top 10. This is one of the few movies I don't mind reading subtitles. Easy to follow and read subtitles. DVD quality was superb. Strongly recommend this.
B005LLX582|1.0|The critics just loved it, but my BF and I found it horrible, disjointed, pretentious, and pointless.  A totally unwatchable mish-mash.  For one thing, didn't expect to watch 45 mins. (or more) of Earth history, from the Big Bang, thru dinosaurs, thru evolution of man.  I know there's a connection to the central characters in there; just could never quite figure it out.  Sighed in relief when it was finally over with.<br /><br />Must learn to not pay attention to critical reviews--almost always the opposite of my opinions.  In spite of the fact that this movie played locally for MONTHS.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|I got saddle sores watching this DVD.  I even dreamt about it.  The good guys always win.  Shoot it up.  Where is the popcorn?
B008Y73940|4.0|Good not great movie.  I like the pace and plot lines of the book better.  I would recommend this movie.

B007IWG3WC|3.0|It is no Jaws installment but nonetheless has some cool characters I am interested in. Could have been better, but what can you do? The special effects were good but the story line could've been better.
B0034G4P80|3.0|The movie wasn't what I expect to be. I thought there would be more to love story but I did like the ending.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I just got a kindle fire for my B-DAY I was so  EXCITED because they had MINIONS!!! I just got the app just because I love minions. Sadly I never got to play it BECAUSE IT ALAWAYS SAID LOADING...<br />AND NEVER PLAYED. I SO WISH I COULD RATE ZERO STARS.
B008Y73940|4.0|Great story and character development. If your looking for a good movie to keep your interest and not be completely dumb like so many of today's moves... This is it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I LOVE this show! I just am so bummed I have to wait so long for season 4 to come out.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Love these guys! Saw them live last month. Super upbeat and always puts me in a good mood. Especially Ode to Sleep and House of Gold.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I enjoyed this book, especially at the beginning when it was fun and exciting and filled with potential, much like the anticipation of going to the circus.  And then the dark began to creep in and I was getting a little bummed out, but the mysteries woven into the story kept my interest. And, I'm glad they did because the ending wrapped everything up into a neat and shiny little package.... or did it?  I found myself thinking and imagining what might happen next and how everything fit together and yet didn't. A thought provoking read.
0525953728|5.0|It is like flossing between teeth, rather much more better. I would recommend it as the best tooth pick in the market.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I bought this for a family member for his birthday.  I had already bought a copy for myself.  It is an amazing movie!  This copy is the two-disc special edition as mentioned in title.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it!!!  Wish it was much longer! Game is great to test your thinking skills and to have fun! I would recommend
B005LAIH2W|5.0|THE SHIPPING WAS LIKE THE FLASH HAD IH.GREAT AFFECTS IDID LIKE IT,\. ACTION MOVE I DID NOT  WANT GONE WIT THE WIND.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Amazing show!!! Love the quality of the video, purchasing is so easy, it never stalls out, like Netflix sometimes does, I would recommend this show!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much and I am happy that it is finally here! I had it on my dad's I pad and I phone but on my kindle it's awesome. I  am disappointed that it takes forever to update. If you really want a good game you should get this game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show, highly recommended!! The video quality is great, easy to purchase, love it that I don't have to wait long for to upload, I would recommend Amazon Video.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The best game ever in the world you need to get the game 1 to 10 11 I really like the game
B000ICXQXS|3.0|We watched Butch Cassidy and Sting back to back.  Had seen both in the theaters when they came out, but not since.  We expected Sting to outshine Butch, but it was the other way around.  Both are wonderful movies and Paul and Bob are great together, but somehow the lines were better throughout Butch.
B00AHJL7BK|1.0|all this is- MATH! i got it thinking it was suduko but, it's not i say no, don't get please
B004LQGXLE|5.0|Watched this and the Sting together the other night.  Loved Butch and Sundance from beginning to end.  But seeing it again, the details in the filming, as well as the poignancy of the script, with a true Greek tragedy structure, were evident.  Plus Bob and Paul just had one great line after another.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is great for passing time. It is fun and has a level of difficulty that is neither easy or extremely hard. It makes you use your brain.
B000OONQBM|3.0|it does the job one of my fave movies I do wish it was in a bit better shape. thanks
1451695195|4.0|I loved this book although at times it got a little too scientific for me.  This is just another way God is trying to make sure his children realize that there is something wonderful beyond our earthly life.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|We really enjoy this dvd! It is fabulous quality and would order it over and over again! Thanks for checking!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best it is not like subway surfers at all you go too a big minion wearing a tie what a rush lol nice graphics to...<br /> BEST GAME EVER
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Vivid description of feelings and action when facing adventure,  fear, survival and mortality. A must read for those looking for creative ways to establish partnerships with perceived enemies.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|This game was ok. Interesting story (even if the characters were a little too chatty), and a variety of mini games as well as the normal seek and find. Unfortunately, for all the in game chatter, very few of the boards actually told you what you were supposed to be doing. It would say something very basic like &quot;solve the puzzle!&quot; without giving ANY parameters, such as what the rules to the game were. You pretty much had to just play &amp; fail until you figured out what it wanted you to do. Add that to the fact that you had to tap directly in the center of an object (or something) to make it acknowledge your tap, and it often got super frustrating. Example: you're supposed to pick up something &amp; put it in a slot. You could drag the item to the slot 20 times, but it wouldn't stick until 21. Or you could tap something you know you're supposed to pick up, but it just wouldn't register. Combine those 2 complaints &amp; you get boards where you end up just tapping the entire screen randomly until something clicks. Altogether, I'm glad I got this game on the day it was free (yesterday?). I beat it with only a moderate amount of swearing involved, &amp; now I'm going to erase it. $3? Not worth it. Maybe .99, if you really like seek &amp; find games.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app will not load.  Tried deleting and reloading twice. Very disappointing.  It's free, but not fun if it won't work properly.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It was great watching it again on my computer! I can't wait to watch some more movies, some I've missed and some I need to see again!
B0090EKRKU|2.0|It looks nice but even the kids got a little bored with this one.  Horton was much better.  Seemed forced.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I like connect 3 games and this one takes some skill. It's fun and has me addicted to it. I also love tthe &quot;little people&quot; who cheer each time you complete a building--very cute.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stepphen King always creeped me out...don't like being scared at night...but this was  wonderful story telling (imoportant) - brought so much back from my youth...truely enjoyed the story...
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|I'm glad I only rented this. Didn't even finish watching it. To long & way to drawn out. Couldn't keep the kids attention. Disappointed
B005LAIH2M|5.0|fun to watch liked special effects, like action filled fantasy adventure movies. not much more to say for me real good
B005TMSN4E|1.0|This adapter does not actually work with the Nikon 1. It fits alright but the camera does not recognize that it has a lens attached
B007IXWKUK|3.0|PART 2 again keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next move. Can't wait to finish freed.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I bought the appa long time ago and used it on my iPod. then I graduated to a Streak and found it stil very useful. I purchased a Fire and still kept the app. It transferred with me!  i really like the notetaking highlighting and read out loud features. Great app.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My son loves to play this app!  You get to build baby animals which he thinks is really cool!  Definitely worth buying the full version :0)
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I'm a big puzzle nut and this one is no disappointment at all.  Lots of variety in the puzzles, will definitely purchase more of these.
B0039RY3MM|5.0|If you delid your CPU this stuff is top notch.<br /><br />After applying this to my delided i7 4770K @ 4.4 GHz my temperatures dropped an easy 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
B005LAII12|4.0|This movie is so well written with the 21st century knowledge. I laughed and laughed.<br /><br />The language is strong and over done.<br /><br />The ending is with hope.
B00632HWOG|5.0|No real issues with this app. It is definitely a top of the line mail app and a great way to access yahoo mail.
B0030F5W5K|4.0|Great cast,  with the ultimate &#34;love story&#34;  requirements blended nicely with lots of comedic content..  One you can easily watch again and again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A splendid mystery - the characters are so well drawn I was hooked after the first few pages.  Because I was so into the story until the very end, I was enraged that she wasn't caught.  I will read all Gillian Flynn's other books!
B003TH14H4|4.0|The second season fulfills the promising start of Season 1.  The plot lines are in sync with original season with writers slowly building the relationship between the main characters.
0545586178|5.0|Loved the first part and this one is not that good but is quite close to it. Would like to read the third part as well. :)
B000I9S69K|4.0|Can't resist the plot or the excellent cast in this super movie.  This one is worthy of many viewings because it's so much fun watching the twists and turns evolve even though you know they are coming.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I got coin dozer on the recommendation of a friend. It is fun as I try to make the most coins or prizes or other items go into the bin in the front. However, when I run out of coins, here we go, I can buy more coins for real money (shows up on my bank statement), in order to continue playing. So a person needs to realize how fast you can go through real dollars when you are playing. So I just put it away for a while, and I'm refreshed with enough coins to play for a few minutes. Each person needs to decide how much they want to put into the game.
B0043WDK2G|4.0|Perfect blend of characters, crimes, and probable love story all rolled into the series to keep you coming back for more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game really lets your mind imagine and explore you can always different things it's really AMAZING!!! I would suggest this to anyone who likes to build and create things using there imagination. Anything on Mine craft is possible!!!
B009MYAQOA|5.0|This story is fun, interesting, and well written. Any one who has gone through divorce will appreciate how things rarely change!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Okay. I absolutely LOVE this game! I was playing it just fine last night, but this morning it wouldn't let me play it all! Ive deleted it and redownloaded it and it still wont work! Ughh. Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks!
B003G4W49C|5.0|A study in leadership under extreme conditions, set in a science fiction setting.  Ender's Game tells a very adult tale with a cast of children.  I find it interesting that I truly enjoyed the book, yet I couldn't find a single character I really liked.  It's just not that type of story.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I can't imagine anyone going through what she did and coming out a survivor!The book is very detailed.  It is amazing how at such a young age she was able to get along with her captives.
B001SKB1Y0|2.0|Javier Bardem plays a codependent, somewhat neurotic although very attractive artist; the Christina character is just a confused, spoiled young woman and Penelope Cruz plays a personality disordered, histrionic woman.<br /><br />Rachel Hall's character, Vicky, is the only sympathetic role I found who resists temptation only when violence erupts.  I hope she finds happiness with the less mercurial but more stable man played by Chris Messina.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Too much talking but a good game to pass the time.<br />Puzzles are well hidden and makes you search for them.
B000NI8F5G|4.0|Cheerful, attractive, hugely talented cast.  I laughed at the shrill voiced attempts of the actress to do the 'talkies' .Eye and ear candy.  Enjoyed it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome I cant stop playing it when I first started to play it it was addicting this app its even better than temple run so peace awesome game gtg and try to beat my highscore I'm out lmao bye :D
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book left me smiling, laughing, sobbing, and breathless in the best ways. Truly a book that I will hold forever in my heart. I cannot say enough about how it has impacted me.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|A classic movie about a peaceful and beautiful man. This is a must-see for its historical significance. My wife was amazed by his kindness.
B005544V6A|4.0|Even though its a bit of a formula there is enough friction generated in the acting to keep a few sparks flying.
B00338QENI|5.0|Fascinating reading and made for great discussion at our book club meeting. I would recommend it to any one who has an interest in science and sociology.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I had a lot of hopes going into this movie, but found myself mildly annoyed by the time the credits rolled in. This is by no means a bad movie. In fact there are some great ideas and a even a half-decent portrayal of Bipolar Disorder and OCD, which by the way were more consistent with public perception than the actual presentation of these disorders. The story moves well, has enough depth to hold ones attention, and the two very attractive main characters helped. At the end however, the story felt to me as though it fell short of amazing, and just ended up another 21st century &#34;i'm kinda screwed up, but hey so is everyone else, and oh yey love!&#34;, which is nauseatingly common in today's romantic comedies.<br /><br />Worth a watch though...
B009SS9632|5.0|A wonderful book set in the same universe as Martin's Dying of the light (which is dark but I highly recommend it ). He intertwines suspense, philosophy and wit to create one of the best science fiction books I have read in a long time.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|many levels, hours of entertainment.  I'm not sure how the scoring works except that the larger the puzzle, the more the points
B004TI5N38|5.0|This is such a great mystery.  It keeps you wondering right up to the last page. The author is gifted at being able to keep several story lines going at once without losing the reader.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|the game is fun. but there is too much time taken with dialog screens which I haven't been able to figure out how to skip.
0307450570|5.0|I bought this as a (requested) present for my wife. She digs it. There are tons of craft ideas in here that have inspired her in her creative endeavors. The Martha Stewart name obviously doesn't mean what it used to. Who cares? She didn't write it anyway. The ideas have been very enjoyable and useful a for creatively oriented person.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Portrays the understanding that disasters effect all classes of people in the same manner.  Sadder events than in the 2nd season but still looking forward to more seasons.
0385040253|5.0|This is the quintessential book of knots. Accept no substitute. It is so widely used that, when you look up knots on the internet or in other books, you will see them referenced by their ABOK (Ashely Book of Knots) code.    Yes, it's a lot of money to spend on a book about tying ropes together. Unless you, like me, enjoy trying out random knots in your spare time, delighting in finding similarities and themes that gradually lead you to a deeper understanding of why certain knots work for certain applications -- in other words, unless you really geek out on knots, you will probably never bother tying 90% of the knots in this book.    After a lot of knot tying, some interesting principles of knots start to become clear. The logic of them. The beauty. Remember when you were a kid, and didn't know how to tie knots, and you would secure a rope to a post by performing as many random loops and intersections as possible? The knowledge of this book will enable you to save your own child from a similar fate as you pass on the knowledge and ability to confidently tie exactly the knot to do the job -- no more and no less.    The book contains details of over 3,900 knots and has numerous illustrations on how to tie them. They are organized into the below broad categories:  - Occupation knots  - Knob knots (multiple chapters on different kinds)  - Single loop knots  - Double and multiple loop knots  - The noose (yes, a whole chapter on nooses!)  - Knots tied in the bight  - Clove hitch and other crossing knots  - Binding knots  - The turk's head  - Bends (a bend is knot-speak for how to tie together two ropes)  - Shroud knots  - Belaying and making fast  - Hitches (multiple chapters on different kinds)  - And many more chapters on decorative and fancy knots, knot puzzles, how to splice ropes together, and much more    In some ways this book is like a high end dictionary. You might not want or need to know every word in the dictionary, but there is something about having a solid book on the shelf that contains this knowledge and is accessible with the turn of a page. What you have in the Ashley Book of Knots is an accounting of the life's wisdom of one man, through the lens of knot tying.    My first copy of this book, I annotated and bookmarked and scribbled in as continued study unraveled (sorry) the connections between knots shown in different categories, for different uses. That book, sadly, was lost to my neighbor who is from a foreign country and expressed some interest in knots, and whose English was not that great, and when I lent him the book, he accepted it solemnly as a gift and I never saw it again. I was upset. My wife bought me a replacement as a present, bless her.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Addicting! I have not purchased a game that I enjoy this much. Fun & challenging. Time disappears when I play this game.
0316066524|3.0|Like a lot of DFW fans I bought this book because I enjoyed his essays immensely. I did not enjoy this book immensely. I do not consider myself qualified to provide a review of the book's literary merits and so will leave that to others. All I can say is that if you've come to this book because you enjoyed his other work, it may not be what you're looking for. Your mileage will almost certainly vary.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|it is great I love all the songs it's Buddy Guy at his best the new messing with the kid is great and  I married the devils daughter is fantastic
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series is top notch:  love all the details to staying true to the era....makes me feel like I am there.  Enjoy the characters and their struggles and triumphs.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|It isn't the best movie but it wasn't bad either. I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to others.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Very intriguing and some difficult to figure out.  Very entertaining.<br />I would like to do another puzzle like this one.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Once I started i couldn't stop reading!  but I was very disappointed because the ending didn't make a lot of sense which upset me a bit. Nevertheless I still recommend it.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I got so addicted to the prime free episodes that I just had to pay to see everything! Can't wait for the new season!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Pretty fun game.  There is a lot of talking but, you can tap your way through it.  Just be careful though, sometimes it's a clue.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Many complain of the quality of the voice.  I find his lyrics perfectly suited for his haunting and chilling delivery.  In this album a tempest rages and the tightest of rock/blues bands. It shines as each masterful performance is delivered under the best written lyrics published this year
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I enjoy playing it.... as do the kids... I like the scoring as it allows you to upgrade with the coins you earn from multiple attempts at the course.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Tough read but will read again. Sometimes a bit confusing re: names but nevertheless insightful.  Would recommend to those interested in cultural explorations
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. Good story, but it kind of fell apart towards the end. It's a movie that leaves you feeling emotional about the characters - very unusual.
B008F5Y7UQ|4.0|Good cast of actors. Different landscapes. Good depiction of the many opinions of people in varied cultures and within cultures.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|There are 20 more words required for me to finish this rating of a five. It was a great book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Challenges you. Aside from the Star Wars theme, this game is well worth playing. A little more difficult to get the 5 stars. And, Very Addictive!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the first of the trilogy, Fall of Giants. I found that much of the history referenced in the book took place during my early childhood and later my adult years. The author has done a good job of bringing the events to life through his engaging characters. Can't wait for the third book to be released.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|It was OK but I noticed that the book comes up in several different ways on different Kindle versions, some good some so-so.  It would be good if the conversion could be optimised further to give best possible rendition at the customer's interface regardless of which Kindle they have..<br /><br />regards,<br /><br />Paul Fitz-George
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow the end to a great trilogy. I really enjoyed this series. Very well written with characters you learn go care about. I think everyone should read this book to be reminded of what one human can do to another in the name of freedom. But then again it is just a great story. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B00004TDTO|5.0|With over a thousand reviews and having been around almost 40 years, I have nothing to add except to say that Jaws still holds up as one of the best pictures of its kind. Helping no end are a cast of seasoned professionals who gave Spielberg all that a Director could ask for. It never goes over the line to become too maudlin and, thanks to the performance of Dreyfuss and Shaw, ably abetted by straight man, Scheider, possesses the element of humor which saves it from being a horror film. Well worth watching another time if you saw it some years ago. Of course, if you haven't yet seen it, be sure to make the occasion to do so.<br />2015. Just saw it again....no change to make in my remarks. I enjoyed it, yet again...although this time I did find Shaw's performance clearly ''over the top&#34;. I note all the reviews knocking this  particular reissue....not having had any other copies...this was good enough for me back then.....and still is good enough for me today since I lack most of the high powered stuff that goes into a contemporary set.
B0006GVJEE|1.0|I have tried on two players and they both say &#34;can't play this disc. &#34;Appearance of disc is fine.  There is no appearant damage.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It held my interest and didn't drag. Was a well written,good story. Am wondering what book two will be like.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Th  game is super addicting and is a lot o  fun to play but the city coins can take along time to regenerate. Overall I would get it
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This is my favorite season of this great series. I love everything about this series including the sets & costumes. That's why I had to get the hi-def BluRay set.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my son likes this game he is 5 yrs old he gets excited I give him a high five when he passes lecvel;s just like the game it self
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun little twists to solve. Not too difficult to drive you nuts. Wish there were more rooms. Guess we'll just have to wait.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is totally worth it. It is scary but SUPER fun and for all of u slender man lovers this is the game for u. Best slenderman game ever!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is fun just like subway surfers and temple run. Since I downloaded it on my kindle fire I have been tagging minions, dodging cars, ducking under water hydrants and battling evil villains all in the name of fun.... until this game started with its bugs it wouldn't download, the glitches interrupted my game constantly, and so I must give this game 3 stars. Without the problems this game is 5 stars of fun.
B005XP60S8|5.0|Even though I brought this in the summer, it is a really great box set for any Justin Bieber fan. What made me buy it appose to just the deluxe cd, what the extended booklet with very hot/cute pictures of him. Whereas just the jewel case only has a few. It also comes with an ornament, 12 days of Bieber (no chocolate), 45 page booklet, and CD/DVD Deluxe edition of \\"Under the Mistletoe\\". It is a great thing to have! I say buy it!!!!!
0446573027|2.0|I've read a lot of Baldacci books. I'm a big fan.  I started with his Camel Club series which is SO good and still my favorite, but have read many more of his books since then.  Zero Day was a bit of a disappointment for me.  I ordered it because I enjoyed the character of John Puller in his last book.  Zero Day was slow to develop.  It took half of the book to begin to develop the actual story line.  I was disappointed in the characters and how he used them as the story played out.  Just not up to par with Baldacci's usual style.  Even though I know Baldacci likes to incorporate coal mining from his home state of West Virginia in his stories, I thought this was a very strange plot and became even stranger as it concluded. Not even close to his best work in my opinion but it won't stop me from reading his work in the future.
086547897X|5.0|This book is called a survival guide for a reason, its filled with tons of info, and my favorite aspect are the numerous amount of illustrations for demonstration to becoming a stronger Animator.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing app and sometimes it gets addicting :)<br />I love all the different kinds of minion costumes u can choose from.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like it because it helps me know the weather and when im going out if I should or not thanks weather channel p.s I watch your channel on tv
B00821OX98|5.0|great series its just good science fiction lots of action well written and not over acted by the cast most of the time
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is well worth playing. It challenges me. The expressions of the minion are fun. Try the challenge today.
B00594XOZU|5.0|absolute wonderful app=works great and so far does not seem to go down.<br />wonderful that it is free. would download again
B00C061I3K|5.0|Summer hit Get Lucky makes this album a hit, but the rest of the songs are just as great, going back to the authentic recording style of the 60s, 70s, and 80s as mentioned by Gorgio. This album is splended. Hope to see more surprising albums in the future.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I got this for my boyfriend because he liked the sound of &#34;Radioactive.&#34; I liked the cd, but he said he didn't care for too many of the other songs and said they didn't sound like what he was expecting. As for the shipment, it came within a few days. Very nice service, but before you buy the CD, check out the other songs on YouTube or something to hear them first because they don't all have the same &#34;feel&#34; as Radioactive.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I really liked the movie! It wasn't that scary though. The the story line made it soo much better! I really enjoyed it.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />In \\"The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada\\", Damian Stevenson takes the real life and experiences of Sir Ian Fleming during World War Two and turns it into a masterful work of storytelling.  The novel reads far more like a work of fiction, only because the twist and turns, mystery and intrigue, gadgets and, yes, alcohol, reads far more like the vivid imagination of an author than real life.  And, in a way, that's exactly what it is.  It's a fantastic life that lent itself to Sir Ian's telltale character: James Bond.<br /><br />Stevenson clearly did a remarkable amount of research about his title character prior to writing.  The detail and imagery draws in the reader and doesn't let go throughout the story.<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of fiction or a lover of history, you will love \\"The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada\\".
B008JF8O9M|2.0|This app has possibilities but it didn't have my printer listed.  The list of printer brands is good but it doesn't, unfortunately, give a full list of printers that are out there.  To be honest, that would be a daunting task.  I was hoping it would allow me to pick and choose from the printer(s) available on my other network systems but, alas, that isn't the case.  Still, if you have a printer covered by this app then this could be a wonderful thing to have on your Kindle.  Being unable to test the functionality I can't comment on how well it actually work.  More the pity.
0765365278|5.0|To be fair, when we read this my daughter was less than a month old, She would sleep on my chest while I would read it. But we had a great time those late nights and early mornings when she was being fussy. This book really helped when I had to be awake late. And even when I wasn't up late, I would read this book all the time it was so interesting. I thought the characters were well played, and for me they had just enough background information and character, I thought brandon did Great! This book was so good I can't wait to read the next 10 Brandon has planned!
B00C90T4QK|5.0|He is our favorite singer and this album lived up to our expectations. I will be ordering more of his music.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was an excellent complement to the book, bringing to life what the author so vividly wrote.  Entertaining movie.
B00DYMM76Q|3.0|Too many songs I've never heard before. Probably plan to put out another album with more hits. I hope so.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|Great product and quality. I like so much. It is a good product and good price I would buy again. Thank you.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|We had a few of his Christmas songs that were on his &#34;Let It Snow&#34; album but this one includes most of the classics that never get old. Loved it!!!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Great product and quality. I like so much. It is a good product and good price I would buy again. Thank you.
B00A2GQIHG|5.0|Contains her hits over the years. GREAT!!! Too bad she had to leave this planet so soon. She was way too talented and too young!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great product and quality. I like so much. It is a good product and good price I would buy again. Thank you.
B00A5FPQBI|4.0|GREAT MOVIE!! Acting was good along with the action scenes. Would recommend for foreign film seekers to watch.  the movie really shows the reality jamaica and a gangsta mentality they might adopt.
B00005LK94|5.0|A very great Movie, I watched it many times and Invited friends to watched it. Nobody had any complaints about it and said they were glad I invited them to watch it. 2 thumbs up for this awesome Show
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I must admit I got this book because a friend recommended it. At that time I had no idea how long it was and was shocked when I found out. However, while reading, the book takes you away and you start rooting for the main character and believing you are in Texas in the sixties. Kudos to King for keeping me intrigued all the way through the afterword.. I can't wait to read another one.
B009R659L8|5.0|Keeps you guessing to the end. Good story, different from the usual suspense novel. Family difficulties and how it all ties in at the end will keep you interested until the last page.
140006922X|1.0|A member of our congregation read this book, and announced from the pulpit that it contradicts the Bible, which is the true source of information about Jesus.  I haven't read it yet, but I intend to.
B004KRQFI0|3.0|I don't think Skrillex will ever beat his last album 'Bang-a-rang'!  This one doesn't gel like his previous one. I hope it grows on me, because Skrill is something else!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This app helps you really tap into your creative side.  Some of the characters have an interesting look but the sounds they make are funny.  Everyone in our house plays this game!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best show! Can't wait for the new season.  The characters are always full of surprises. And the ending?  Heartbreaking!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|An account of two people leading separate lives that will intersect in an amazing way. This story while heart breaking at times, redeems itself into a heartwarming one. The author took me places of terrible low places suffered by children yet kept hope alive as years and years of struggle turned into a beautiful outcome. I loved the Irish dialect and could just hear the conversations. Lovely book of redemption and amazed that religious orders could inflict such suffering.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|From a hardware viewpoint, it is a great device.  My biggest complaint is that there is not an operators console.  There is no way to control who can send items to the youtube queue, if they can see the device, they can send items to the queue and even worse delete them.  I understand that it is a young device, but this issue needs to be looked at.  My second issue is with Amazon.  I ordered 2 chromecasts, sent to 2 address, prior to the Netflix cut off time, but have still not received an email with the 3 month Netflix code.<br /><br />That said, the device is brilliant.  I use it with windows laptops, android phones and a samsung chromebook.  Streaming locally from a chromebook, or pc works as long as you have a fast router and fast computer.  The netflix integration is very well done.  It is possible to start a video on the phone, switch it to the chromecast, then back to the phone, walk into another room and put it on the tv there.  All without loosing sync or place in the movie.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Have always loved the Beatles but did not have copies of their early year's music. I now play and listen to this CD all the time.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|After reading other reviews, I didn't expect much. I was proven wrong. This movie was enjoyable and action packed. Would be interested in another entry into the Hansel & Gretel story.
B000002KE2|5.0|This is a classic Sabbath album from the original lineup, recorded while they were at the top of their game. I was missing this album from my collection and found it here for a reasonable price. I looked around here at Amazon and also on Rhapsody for the mp3 version of this album but couldn't find it. Didn't look at iTunes because I don't do Apple. Now I am happy that I've just about completed my Sabbath collection with this addition.
0767827791|5.0|I now have 3 copies of Picnic...the VCR, a DVD and then this newest version on DVD which is fabulous.<br />The historian's commentary is so interesting.<br />The quality of this DVD is excellent and it arrived on time and securely packed.<br />Enjoy this fabulously sultry, visually pleasing movie.
B009PNQUXO|3.0|It is ok for me but I would like it much better if the option was there to select where/what folder I wanted to down load the video into.
0399255370|5.0|My six year old son has asked to read this book almost every night since we bought it. I also enjoy this book much more than the usual kids book.
B003P9VZ0W|3.0|bought for 2 yo daughter to stick to the wall in her room.  the walls are painted with basic household acrylic paint, nontextured.  the stickers tend to peel up at the edges.  so far none have fallen off but since my daughter cannot reach them to pick at them it is clear that the adhesive is subpar.  otherwise was perfect.  would recommend with reservations.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I always like Vince Flynn.  Felt a little let down, each new book<br />is a little more cookie cutter..............  You can take the new characters,<br />drop them into an older book.  Voila!  Next book.  I'm afraid it's<br />happening with all the popular writers when you're grinding out a<br />book a year.
B004GHBQ7O|4.0|A great mix of songs from the 21st Century breakdown tour. I don't think it was a well produced as the Bullet in the Bible set. Sound quality on all the songs is a good balance between crowd noise and the band. Flows together pretty well for being pieced together from several different shows.<br />My disk had a scratch in it that makes for some nasty skipping during good riddance so that combined with the comparison to &#34;Bullet&#34; is why only 4/5
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun and puzzling. I enjoy playing this. It's not too hard or too easy.<br />I would recommend this app to everyone.
B0015FHDRW|5.0|Normally I don't like when a band does a side project, why not just put it out as the &#34;normal band&#34;. This is a great album tho, lots of hard hitting up beat songs. Ventures just far enough away from where Green Day is but still familiar enough to know who's behind it all.<br /><br />Has a nostalgic feeling of 60s style rock/blues. Really enjoy it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is awesome. I recommend this game to someone who loves dragons. try the I pad edition<br />this game is not rated pg. I would rate it e for everyone
B005MMY9A8|3.0|I watched this movie to get the backstory on The Avengers, so it was good in that respect.  Otherwise it was fairly stilted. But what else should you expect from a movie that casts Natalie Portman as an astrophysicist.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You've  got to get this game. It is the best game it is very expensive but it is worth it. GET THIS GAME
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this app! So much fun..this game is entertaining for sure! I would definetly try this game with my kids too. Glad its good summer fun.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|It took a wee while to get into the book but once you are introduced to the characters and you see what is happening, it is hard to put the book down.
B00AAZSH0U|3.0|I LOVE Sandra Boynton's board books so when this was available on Kindle I was excited.  However, nothing beats the real thing.  While it's nice in a pinch to be able to read this to my grandkids. The board book is sooo much better.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game alot. It is sometimes a bit slow loading but it is overall great. It is a good game for horse lovers.
B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|Great voice, simple and effective production from Jeff Tweedy, and an interesting and arresting mix of songs from an Parliament's \\"Can You Get to That\\" to new material from Tweedy and Nick Lowe as well as a selection of more traditional gospel numbers.  Don't miss You Are Not Alone (also produced by Tweedy in 2010), as well as the Ry Cooder produced We'll Never Turn Back from 2007.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I especially like the ability to shuffle in this version...unlike others where you play game after game without being able to finish due to 'no more moves'.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|yep. played three minutes and was hooked.  bought th full version and not ashamed to say so.  love love love
1481879103|2.0|Dead Medium is a cute idea (a ghost who can communicate with the living, instead of the living who can communicate with the dead), but it really could use a lot more editing to pick up the pace. The story is slow to start, and while there are some great bits of dialogue, it does feel like a fist novel with potential that just wasn't realized. It's one of those stories that you end up wishing you could like more.<br /><br />The story also wanders a bit due to not really having much for the main character to do other than get involved with various other dead folks--it's really hard to have pressing issues, however, when you are dead.<br /><br />More humor, more editing would help this novel quite a lot. Some folks might enjoy the light story, but it ended up not being the sort of book that really kept my interest. It will be interesting, however, to see how Peter John develops as an author--he does have clever ideas, and if he can find the right editor to help him better shape and sharpen his stories, he may do well.
B00BGI086Q|2.0|After the television show Smallville they came up with the tv show Arrow and i frankly don't like it. I thought that Justin Hartley played a better more modernized Green Arrow than Stephen Amell. Each Show is pretty much the same boring format the whole time. They consist of many flash backs on the island that may or not( mostly not) be revelevant to what the episode is about in the present. The appearence as Green arrow is very short(about 5 minutes of the 45 minute show)and you can expect him to say every episode to a bad guy (You have failed this City) which is kind of annoying and stupid. Constantly every episode shows oliver queen working out with no shirt on in his arrow cave or whatever you want to call it. Are the producers trying to make a show for male superhero fans or are they trying to attract little girls to check this shirtless guy out? A lot of the dialouge on the show needs some work it is so crappy and boring it makes me want to fall asleep. Arrow has a horrible veiwer ratings at about 3.21 million viewers per episode and if this show wasn't being aired on CW(worst ratings station for tv shows), it surley would be canceled. I gave season 1 a chance, didn't really like it and have no interest on pursuing on to Season 2 or the seasons to come if there are any.
B009AMAGXK|2.0|The only reason I'm not giving this dismal film adaptation a single star is because of the decent performances -- something you would expect of a cast headlined by Emma Thompson, Jeremy Irons, and Viola Davis. Frankly, I wonder if this is the screenplay these fine actors saw when they signed on to the film, because this movie is like a July day in South Carolina: a hot mess.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm shocked that the authors of the series would have allowed such a slip-shod version of their novel to find its way to the big screen. The story line has been changed willy-nilly; events don't unfold chronologically, major plot points have been changed or dropped, and the ending doesn't even begin to resemble the taut conclusion to the first book. In addition, some important characters have been written out of the film version entirely while others seem to have undergone personality transplants. Frankly, had the title of the film and the names of the main characters been changed, I wouldn't have recognized it; I would have simple thought it was a cheap rip-off.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to a quiet evening with a good film -- obviously, that didn't happen. My recommendation is to read the books, and avoid this mess of a movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We loved these episodes and cannot get enough.  We can not wait until january to resume the series.  Everyone should watch this.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like that it has zoom! There are several challenge options as well as phenomenon in each room in each room as well as a race against the clock all of which keep it interesting.I've enjoyed the free version thus far finding no need to purchase anything yet as patience rather than a need to rush through it has worked well for me.
B00499NHLC|5.0|We love this show. My wife watches the American version and she said this show is better than that one. It is smart and keeps you on the edge of you seat. I love the thought that is put into the show.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very well written and just plain funny<br />I very much recommend this book for reasons of choice Can't wait for the next one!
B0081336FO|5.0|Me and my wife could not get enough of this show. I am so happy they created the 3rd season.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the details and the way the book really plays out like a movie in my head. It's a great book for anyone!!
0307341577|5.0|Like other reviews, I couldn't put it down either. It has everything you want in a story and some lines are worded so perfectly, you have to re-read them. Definitely recommend this book for the age appropriate. I didn't want it to end, but also did so I knew who did it.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I didn't know if I would ever see the end of this book. It just goes on and on. It has to be the most interesting book I have ever read. I have had some physical problems lately and the book has taken my mind off of feeling sorry for myself. Thanks to Ken Follet for a great book.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I'm having issues downloading and launching the app.it froze at two percent downloading in game.I will try deleting it and reinstalling,and really hope it works.This looks like such a fun game.But until then,one star for the minions,one for the effort.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best it is funny fun and funky it is the game to get if your looking for a funny fun you get the point
B006903GX8|5.0|I had never seen downtown abbey before purchasing this book.  It was a great way to understand what was going on and who people were since I had missed the first season.  I bought it as a kindle book and read it on my tablet.  The pictures were fabulous.
0545405777|5.0|I bought this for a present and my friend loved it. It's a gorgeous book and a great collector's item if you love The Hunger Games.
B005EHILV4|4.0|We use two 11.6 computers in our house, one Windows 8 and one Google Chrome. At our family's communication center, we have one large monitor that hooks up to both computers. The audio is fed through this mixer into a powered speaker system. I designed it and we like it that way.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After watching the movie I wanted to read the book. It's a great story in such an I interesting world. I read the whole thing in three days! I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to escape into a book.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|First let me say that I think this is a great game, it made me think outside the box.<br />I got it as a free app of the day, but if I had known about it,<br />I would have been more than happy to pay the 99 cents.<br /><br />At first I thought that there is NO way to put flowers on the top left,<br />without putting flowers on the bottom left. Then I wondered what would happen if you watered<br />just the flowers three times.<br /><br />So, that said, using the tools numbered from left to right.<br />2, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4<br /><br />in words to escape confusion,<br /><br />flower seed<br />hat on<br />water<br />water<br />water<br />hat off<br />grass seed<br />water<br />left cover on<br />water<br />left cover off<br />hat on<br />water<br />hat off<br /><br />I probably spent over an hour to figure this out,<br />and it was hard to quit playing, to come write this. LOL<br />Many Thanks Bart
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot like Temple Run, but you don't have to worry about being &quot;eaten&quot;. It is a lot of fun and very addictive!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Although this series is similar to the 50 shades if Gray... It's completely different at the same time. A lot gets resolved and a lot stays unresolved. I can't wait until the next book
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Love this movie!  &#34;Old people&#34; ROCK!!!!!!!  Can't wait till the next one comes out.  Enjoy watching experience overcome violence and bravado!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love the workouts on this set, nice to have great workouts in 20 min when you don't have a lot of time.  Only downfall is there are a lot of commercials and talking to get through to get to the main menu to pick the workout you want.  Annoying to have to go through all of this every time...
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte have grown since winning BGT.  They still have a way to go, but this duo is well worth listening to now, and into the future as they learn more and their voices mature.  I agree with some of the criticisms of others about the technical problems, but hopefully the next album will be better.  These kids (and they are just kids) have a great future!
B005LAII4E|4.0|If you want a simple pure fun action movie this will not disappoint.. it has a lot of cool scenes in there.. and a sense of humor... however this is disappointing compared to the first Joe.. which was a fun action movie in it's own right.. it's not as splashy and when it comes to terms of tech.. the Joe's had the equal to Cobra's in this they are a step or two behind..to be fair that is according to the story line but it is a disappointment.. however it makes up for it with one of the coolest ninja action scenes in a American made movie I have seen ever.. (Not to mention the scene was breathtakingly beautiful) and a lot of great action... so it's a give and take thing... but the thing everyone agreed on.. was we hated them killing off Duke... that was depressing.. overall however.. a very good action movie.. well worth your time if you love action movies..
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Great TV show, better than the original NCIS. The actors and dialogue seem to progress throughout the first season and seem to come into a great actor/writer combination.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun. Graphics are awesome! Very entertaining!! I play it and my nephews play it. Great game for the kids to play in the car!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I liked the show from the very beginning of the 1st episode.  It has kept my attention since, and I am half-way through the first season.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I can watch French Kiss time and time again, and still laugh and enjoy it to the MAX!  Ryan and Kline are wonderful together!  I love the storyline, and they bring their characters to life!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is truly one that will be remembered in years to come!  The actors are fabulous, the storylines are great!
B009PMB3CI|5.0|Even though this was a learning expierience for all my grandkids it was very sweet and the puppies were just darling! My granddaughter was intrigued by this game she loved the adorable puppy and I loved that she was learning while doing it!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not very much of a thrill ride. More like an A B C of how one guy gets his rocks off and screws the government. Whoopee!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I know my grandduaghter loved this game and loved the chalenge! I think it is a great twist on the first Cut the Rope! It is truely fun for everyone!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|&#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is a very well-made show.  There are a lot of diverse characters, and their interactions are complicated yet not difficult to follow.  The plot is interesting, and I love the inside of the huge house that is the central setting!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|We have no idea what these men go through until true stories like this come out. You will find a tear or many running down your cheek. An awesome read. Thank you Marcus!!!!!
B0029QRA1U|5.0|I recently wrote a review about my bad experience with the Ion Profile LP Vinyl to MP3 Turntable. After my 5th call to Ion today( Aug 5th, 2013), Ion was able to finally figure out what the problem was and now the product works just find. It was simply their software and they gave me another software suggestion to use other then their own called Audacity and the problem was resolved. I rated this product as garbage but I am now very satisfied with its performance.. Go ahead and buy this item.  Thank You Andrew Cusson From Ion Support. Your Awesome.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mine craft:-).All I want to know is when is the uptate.I play minecraft all the time I am getting bord of some stuff...
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|Ok movie, slow moving and boring in parts with a predictable ending.  Acting was fine, storyline so much like Bourne movies.
B00BVYU2P2|4.0|Funny show, worth the time invested. One of the few shows that my wife and I can agree on. High school drama, but not unbearable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 never ever get  boring! Recommended for all ages! Totally and fun!get it! You will not regret it! Play it all the time! Addicting and fun at all times!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|It is very challenging. The graphics are very good. This is the type of game I enjoy playing on a daily basis.
B005LTDPJI|3.0|If you have an audio memory of the original LP editions, these CDs may not satisfy.  If you are new to ELO or have<br />only previously heard them on CDs, you may like these.
B00DHHFKE4|4.0|I consumed this in a day, prompted by binge-watching the TV series of the same name, and curious to find and discern the differences between Kerman's memoir and the no doubt, dramatised show.<br /><br />Certainly, many differences exist between the two, and the book is a far more thoughtful, considered, and rather well-written thing. The TV series is rather shinier, though it too contains dark, and darkly humorous moments.<br /><br />Kerman is demonstrably affected by her experience in the US criminal justice system, which is the non-shining exemplar of how not to rehabilitate people. Her point that the vast majority of US inmates are incarcerated on mandatory sentences, for low-risk offences peripheral to a larger web of crime inextricably linked with US poverty and social disjointedness, and often too, with the drug trade, is a damning indictment of a profoundly flawed systems too often emulated in other Western nations, including my own.<br /><br />For anyone interested in the experiences of jail and the life, both cold and heartless, and joyful and heartwarming, Kerman's book is a must-read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I have been watching this via amazon prime. Great series and we look forward to season 4 being available next year.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|Bought this to compare it with the Alec Guinness edition. Also to check out Cumberbatch's<br />performance. Alec , being older, was more believable as Smiley, but Oldman did a fine<br />job too . Cumberbatch did a socko performance , I thought , but I admire Colin Firth for his<br /> understated acting job in this. Never would have guessed.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|This move never fails to make me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it! Excellent cast; terrific storyline! Thumbs way up!!
B00DAXXO98|5.0|What it takes one to get elected makes one unsuitable for the position. I don't find myself saying &#34;What? An elected official wouldn't do THAT!&#34;.
B001MIVTVS|3.0|These CD re-makes are NO WHERE near as good as the original vinyl LPs were.  The sound is sort of tentative and<br />one-dimensional (compared to the original vinyl edition).  Not to mention, tiny CD art work can hardly compete with the<br />original 12 X 12 inch art.
B00AMOOGJ0|5.0|it's so much fun!<br />i like it because is funny<br />o no! why mr.Tall did brake the window?<br />Josefina,chile,7 years old
159420411X|4.0|The first few chapters where Silver discussed successes and failures in predictions were excellent. When he started to generalize to rules for good predictive models, he strayed from the facts to support his own biases, but that's OK. Still a good read.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|&#34;Clearly&#34; , as Sherlock would say, this is the hit of the decade . Out of 76 Sherlock adaptations , I consider this<br />Moffatt and Gattis show far and away the best. Maybe because it is updated for the 21st century , maybe the<br />lead roles are so brilliantly portrayed by Cumberbatch and Freeman, and definitely it offers a fast-paced complete<br />story within 90 minutes complete with stirring cliffhangers .<br />  I am still nursing a broken heart from Reichenbach after watching the cemetery scene. Why have you<br />waited three years for the series to restart? Shake a leg already and let me breath again.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a fun and exciting little show and pretty clean.  You definitely enjoy continuing to see what will happen next.
B002VXGW2E|5.0|Good, mindless entertainment.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  15 more words required?  The rating system needs to lighten up just a little bit.
B000BNI99K|4.0|Most of the selections are a little boring, in my opinion - but a few of them are outstanding.  You've go to like his<br />voice, of course.  I do.
B009439HEY|5.0|This is amazing. While it is not the Genesis versions you may know and love, it is the covers of some of their greatest masterpieces featuring artists like Steven Wilson. Need I say more?
B00BSBY38A|4.0|This is more a children's adventure movie than a serious movie for adults.<br />All the time you are anticipating to the next move, but the end is .............<br />See it for yourself.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|If I could give this zero stars, I would have. A friend actually recommended this book. She said it was a Young Adult book. Young adult porn maybe! I certainly hope high school aged kids are not reading this!! Just sick! The author needs a moral compass. I want my .99 cents back.
B00422LESO|4.0|Read it at one sitting, remembering all the Austen books and thinking, &#34;What a lark that would be!&#34;  I recommend it as a book to pass the time for all Janites, as fans of Miss Austen are called.  Thankfully, my own Mr. Darcy has been by my side for fifty-four years and we have passed through life with great happiness.  True love does exist and it is very real. This is what I say and this is what the book's theme is all about.
B003VR5PPY|2.0|Since I really enjoyed the Professor Layton series, 999 seemed like a decent game to try out due to similarities in story telling and puzzles. However, after about 5 hours of play, I realized that this game is really not a 'game', but a digital novel that is closer to a 'Choose Your Adventure' novels I used to read when I was a kid. There is heavy dialog that is pure text and no voice work, which means within an average hour it's quite often that you will spend 50 minutes reading and scrolling through text, and only 10 minutes playing. This will appeal to some folks, but to me, I couldn't find enjoyment from it, given that I already do a lot of reading at work during the day, I really don't want to read any more than I have to at night time.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading, this will like a good game for you, just don't expect much actual gameplay. If you prefer to spend more time solving puzzles than reading about them, I suggest going with Professor Layton.
B0000C8AV2|5.0|One of Dylan's best albums.  The weakest tunes are Political World and Man in the Long Black Coat.  ALL of the others<br />are gems !
B003NWS5AO|5.0|What doesn't Robert Plant do well? Sure, it is not his best by any means, but it is always so good to hear from him in any of his side projects with various bands.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|I also paid to unlock all items for $3.99. Whenbee opened the game the next day half the stuff was locked again. will not buy anymore games from this developer.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I just watched a rerun of &#34;The Bodyguard&#34; and realized I didn't have a CD with her signature song &#34;I Will Always Love You.&#34; What a sad loss of such a wonderful talent.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I was disppointed that the game took too much space on my Kindle Fire. Had to remove it because it kept locking up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is probably one of the best purchases you could make on your Kindle right now.  This story has everything, from an amazing author who will be a juggernaut in the Sci-fi world for years to come.<br /><br />Eagerly awaiting more.
B0000X61VE|5.0|good workout, sensible, and easy to do. there are two 30 minute workouts and one 10 minute workouts. enough variation so you won't get bored.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its cool honestly to beat other people is awesome buy this game and its free plus cool updates every month
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Not a bad move, but it's nothing compared to the original.  I did find it entertaining, but no worth watching again.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|A peek toward the end of the lifecycle of a seasoned estate and the seasoned characters that have chosen to live within.  I loved the humor which was perfectly timed, the setting was idyllic, Mr. Hoffman did a great job directing - I'd swear he was actually acting it sometimes - there was something about the timing that was sooo Hoffman, and the cast - their talents alone are fabulous, the dynamic of them all working together is such fun.  I sit here feeling happy, resolved, and pensive about all the best stuff of life and remembering to enjoy it all.  This film goes into my \\"Keeper\\" collection.  Well done everyone!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have tried 30 day workout plans in the past. I have done Tracy Anderson's 30 Day Method and simply didn't enjoy it as much. I want to hear my instructor. This dvd is so motivational. Jillian truly surprised and inspired me. There was no yelling just consistent encouragement. For health reasons I was not able to do this workout every day. Even so, I felt I still got muscular and weight loss results. This workout gets me up and moving. Though each new round I would feel sore the first three days or so after that my body did well. I tried not to stress my body too much. Overall great, fun program.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This game is so much fun and a little better than the first one! I can't wait for more updates that come!!!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|A classic. Bought for my special needs daughter. She loves Snow White and so do I. A good classic movie. Wish more movies these days were more innocent. Even though I don't like the idea of a witch being in so many of Disney's movies, good always conquers evil.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I was very surprised at how well I liked this show.  They have very magnetic characters that are easy to get attached to.
B009CG29RK|5.0|We love it and bought it.  My six year old loves everything about it and my wife loves the minions.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love play Solitaire and this app is easy to set and play. Nice cards' movement and options. I very good free app.
1451695195|5.0|I have always had a interest in reading about NDE and have read many over the years. I guess it's the fear of the unknown that frightens me the most about death and I find comfort in knowing there is peace, love and beauty in the here after. Brian's story is fascianating to say the least and I highly recommed it.
B000HZEE64|5.0|This is a movie for adults as well as kids...I really believe everyone would enjoy this..of course I love true stories...hope you enjoy.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Bought for my special needs daughter and she loves it. We saw this movie many years ago with my oldest daughter when she was 4. Has been one of our favorites.
B002PZJMU2|5.0|The Patrick Jane character is very well written and performed by Simon Baker.  I really think it's one of the best TV characters of all time.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|One password to rule them all.  I love the convenience of this product.  It crosses several platforms and performs well on everything but the Barnes & Noble Nook HD+.  But I've found that many apps don't perform well on that hardware.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|THIS APP IS AMAZING I love it I have a kindle fire hd and it works perfectly. Recently my YouTube on the internet changed its format and with this one I need flash player which for some reason I can't get and when I got this app I was so happy it was the same format that I had used on the internet. But you can't comment I have tried to by pressing all the buttons but none of them are for commenting. But overall it's a wonderful app. :D.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Super Bluetooth is a excellent device, would recommend it to anyone.The device works great connecting to my iPhone 5 , no problems you hear people talking to you fine.
B00AEFYKWU|5.0|\\"42\\", \\"The Sandlot\\", \\"The Benchwarmers\\", \\"61\\", \\"Bull Durham\\", \\"A League of their Own\\", \\"The Bad News Bears\\", \\"Field of Dreams\\", \\"The Rookie\\", \\"Rookie of the Year\\", \\"Trouble with the Curve\\", \\"Angels in the Outfield\\", \\"Eight Men Out\\", \\"Fever Pitch\\", \\"The Babe\\", \\"The Natural\\", \\"For Love of the Game\\", \\"Mr. Baseball\\", \\"Little Big League\\",  the list goes on!!!!!!!!!!! My entire family and I watch this movie every year during baseball season. We have finally worn out the videocassete and I bought the DVD for my Dad so we can<br /> continue watching it. GREAT FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B001ILFUD2|4.0|Bought for my special needs daughter. She loves dogs and this is one of her favorite movies. A good movie.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It simply changed my life, I feel so happy!!!!<br />The experiments work, it lets you experience and learn about energy.<br />Thank You
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I like the team effort. Everybody looks out for everybody else. Great game according to my 7-year-old grandson. He loves it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|very good series and I am looking forward to seein the next season just wish it started sooner.  Great job BBC
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the story, I love the characters, I love the sets, I love the clothes.  Maggie Smith was made for her part!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Granted the having to pay for stuff can be problematic, but they had a nice 99 cent of promo for items. I'm enjoying the game and the graphics are good. I used to enjoy this type of game on Facebook, so it's nice to have something similar on my kindle.
B00957T6X6|5.0|If you have watched the HBO series this is a must read, even if you haven't watched it yet, after reading it you will want to watch all three seasons back to back.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I thought the movie was very good. I watched it on my pc, as only a digital copy and the graphics were surprisingly crisp. The story had a different twist that I did not expect. I would recommend this to all ages, but make sure you have seen the original at least twice for a better understanding of what this is about.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|I just finished watching this movie for the second time and I still really enjoyed it. Great movie if you enjoy lots of music.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Addicted, surprised, thrilled, stunned - Awesome television. This was a television show that watched like a movie. Almost as good as the book would be, thats rare.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Fun game. Active game play without having to wait long. Prize claw should be faster like this game. An update would be good for both considering real money is used. You owe it to your players who spend money.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I think the game is okay but the only problem is it takes all day to load to play the game and it is so crazy how long it takes just to load that's my response.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Easy to wear for those long gaming sessions, a fully charged battery will last over 8 hours easily. The only drawback is if you are in an area of several wireless routers you have to tweak the router's channel until you find one that won't interfere with the head phones's connection. Until this is done the connection will momentarily drop from time to time.
B008XNPO20|2.0|review reflects defects in manufacturing, not the quality of the music itself which is awesome.<br /><br />I ordered this vinyl album when it was $14. Side D was a misprint, from a completely different band. I sent it back to amazon and they sent me a new one, and that one was defective too! After the second one they canceled my order and refunded my money and had a canned response about how they would try to fix the problem. After all of this, I end up with my money back when what I wanted was Lonerism, so that's why the review is low.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I played this game on Facebook when I would get on Facebook all the time. Then I found it on here. Woo! Hoo! The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that it would be nice off they would add another item or something.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Everyone in my family fights over it. It was delivered quickly and we are happy with it. Def need to order a couple more.
0812992784|4.0|Oh, it is excellent - although written in 3rd person, somehow he manages to recall all the trauma and details of the fatwa period - and is completely honest in what he says about himself. It is amazing that he lived to tell the story and also managed to live a somewhat normal life through it all. Also the \\"normal\\" deaths among his close ones, while he under a fatwa survived.<br /><br />Has the unerring eye and total recall of a born writer.<br /><br />Kyi May Kaung
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I am enjoying the story behind the game. The graphics are outstanding. If you like search games, this is a good one. You get clues so the game moves along.I will give up in a game if I am in a search for to long or the quests take too much time. So far I have not been asked to buy gems and whatnot.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A bit different from the comics, but well done and the acting is excellent. Cap is my favorite, but Downey (Iron Man) and the other Avengers are just as good. The movie I've waited for since the 60's.
B004IPPINW|5.0|It is a page turner, it is a soulful tale, it is incredibly relevant and I really couldn't put it down - I seldom write reviews , but I just couldn't help myself this time!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is fun for all ages.  Both me and my 5 year old enjoy this game.  It's not too complicated for him like some of the other racing games out there.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For anybody wondering what this is, this is a device about twice the width of a thumb drive that plugs into the back of your tv and lets you stream wirelessly from your laptop/phone/tablet to your tv as long as you have wifi. So it basically lets you hook your laptop to your TV without using an HDMI cable. Its not rechargeable by the way and has to be hooked to an external power source through either the included wall adapter or through another included cable that lets you power it through your TV's USB port.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Still quite good, but not as great as seasons 1&2. A little more predictable this year, but hopefully setting things up for a great season 5
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I can see why so many people didn't like this film; while the effects were stunning, it's more complex than the FX Porn today's Honey Boo Boo culture has grown accustomed to. Cloud Atlas has a complex plot requiring you to remain engaged--lest you be quickly lost and left to do little more than coo at the pretty pictures.<br /><br />NOT recommended for the Legally Blonde crowd, but if you like cerebral, philosophical plots containing timely, biting social commentary, this might be up your alley.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Love this app it really wants u 2 learn about the weapons and own them as well. Just wish that I could
B00BB22GQM|5.0|This album is a little to produced, but I still like it. They just need to fire their producer of this album, for the next album they need to hire Rick Ruben or Butch Vig. Hey, Hey, Hey! Catchy songs are the key and I don't hear a lot of catchy, but I still like it. I'm planning to see them when they come through Tulsa.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|omfg that's the best game ever serusly<br />u should try it :)I liked it a lot to me games. like this is boring nut I have to say its the best ever
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I loved the first 2 books of this trilogy. I understand Rothfuss has already written book 3. Why not release it then? I am unsure how all the plot lines will be adequately addressed in Book 3. I have a suspicion that Book 3 will be split into another 2 or maybe 3 books- this seems to be standard practice for successful franchises. I hope these people don't do it. I personally feel I made a mistake and should have waited until Book 3 came out before buying it. If you have not read the first 2 books I would recommend waiting until the third one is out.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|I loved this series and was sad that there would not be more.  Watch it and you will love it!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I like it
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Due to the show (King and Maxwell), I started reading his books, and loving every one so far. Wanted to read the first in this series and loved it. At the end when he revealed the person behind these events, I was surprised. I had thought of this person but he \\"tricked\\" me in the middle of the book. Well worth it.
B00DC8O6T8|5.0|Catchy song and great melodies. I like this band the first time I heard Safe and Sound. I hope they stand the test of time.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I bought this game app because it was free and everyone was talking about it. So I figured why not.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|For being an action game on a touch screen designed first books (my kindle), this game is awesome and I bought it out of my free 500 coins so no expense paid, but 99&cent;isn't bad at all.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I loved this real life historic drama.  It opened my eyes to a war that I really had not paid attention to.  It is a very moving movie and I highly recommend it.
1573300403|4.0|It does much wanted to buy this Michael Jackson's work. Now I expect to obtain the Vol.1 Thank you very much
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|How amazing that the author can vividly describe the hideous conditions in an Irish orphanage in a feel good book, but she succeeds.  It gives the book a sharp edge.  I guessed the ending but that did not detract from the story.  A good read.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I watched a TED presentation given by Julie Taymor and paid close attention to her films.  I already owned Frida, one of my \\"Stranded on an Island with only Ten Movies\\" favorite picks.  I immediately ordered Across the Universe after watching her TED video.  Across the Universe just joined that select few on my island collection.  The movie is brilliant in the way it weaves the Beatles music into the story into the artistic vision of Julie Taymor.  The emotional intensity in the movie often had both my wife and me in tears.  The imagery is so captivating.  The acting was perfect.  T.V. Carpio was a standout favorite.  The Joplinesque voice of Dana Fuchs (Sexy Sadie) and the Hendrix-like guitar licks of Martin Luther McCoy (Jo-jo) were pure reincarnations of the original artists.  Sit back, crank up your home theater system, and let the music and images stimulate the memories if you were fortunate enough to be alive during those confusing times.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Guys, let's get real here. This is Pintrest. Who doesn't love it? Why does it not have a full five stars? Four and a half is not enough!
B00992CF6W|5.0|While it doesnt have all the options that the pc version does, I have spent many hours playing this game on all my Android devices. My 4 year old loves it as well. There are a couple of tiny bugs since the last update, but none of them affect the gameplay. Best $7 I ever spent on entertainment. If you love (or ever loved) Legos, this is the game for you.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I didn't even watch past thirty minutes because it was boring.  I purchased it because I love Bradley Cooper, but the storyline was not great and it lost my interest.  I wouldn't really recommend this movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have heard from others that this was a good show.  I was reluctant to watch since British accents in films are sometimes difficult for me to understand.  This was not the case with Downton Abbey.  After the first episode, I was hooked.  I would highly recommend this to others.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read the backs of lots of books, or descriptions of books on my kindle, a good unique cover is what sometimes catches my eye or just something about the title. Everything about this one just screamed \\"read me\\".<br />It was intriguing and unique and I can't wait for more.<br />The pictures were something that really added to the book, it gave a visual to some things that really needed that little extra.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game is fun.  I like the theme as well as how it saves your progress after each chapter.  Much longer than other like it.  Thanks!
B000002OTL|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over. One of my favorites. Love the music. Like to listen  to the CD when I'm cleaning and/or cooking.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a &quot;despicable&quot; spin on the highly popular Temple Run, but it's definitely giving the original a run for its money. You don't have to know the films to fall head over heels for this game. It will bring excitement and fun to the lives of all ages. Warning: Play once and you will find yourself playing it over and over again. Game on!!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Did not disappoint. Could not put the book down. Heart wrenching and beautifully written. Never wanted the story to end.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I have been a SciFi fan my entire life. I didn't want watch when it originally aired because Spielberg's name was attached and the world is not a kind shiny place. But and this is s HUGE but, I was laid up after some surgery and I must say I absolutely enjoyed the show. OK, there are some REALLY cheesy scenes but overall I have to say it gets the 5 stars because I am looking forward to every episode. So if you approach viewing this show with a grain of salt you should enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game, but so disappointed when it ended at level 10!! Great for the grey matter though, but be warned, it's addictive!
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Explains the various processes, some good how-to`s, all without getting to technical yet still technical enough to understand the topic. Written in a somewhat conversational style.
B00E9HML1Q|1.0|Really? No DVD version? Been waiting 6 months for this. I am extremely disappointed. Not worth it for the statue alone.
B009WUBERW|5.0|There was never a dull moment and all the cliche lines from their &#34;other&#34; roles really sealed the deal for me.
B00AEUU4LQ|2.0|I felt that there was not a strong enough thread between characters and that stories were disjointed like a puzzle whose pieces didn't quite fit. I feel sad for Pari and Abdullah most of all, I wish to know what could have been. The other characters Gholom and Marco etc. I find that they are lost....the story just doesn't come together...disappointed
B000V6738U|5.0|All the best and finest, takes you back a few years!  Love this collection!  Although I do have their greatest hits, this collection has a few that aren't on my other cd.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Got this app 6 mos. ago as a FAOTD. LOVE it, and so does my wife who, after playing with it on my Kindle for a week or two, bought it to play on her I-Pad. Since then, she's become as hooked on it as I, especially the newly upgraded version that includes an untimed Stationary Camera Mode and a 5 min. timed mode in addition to the original Puzzle, Cube Attack, and One Minute Modes. The only critique I have (and it's quite minor) is that, like all of my other Unity-developed games, it can take a while to load initially, but once loaded the play is fast and the game very entertaining.<br /><br />I highly recommend this, especially for those of us &#34;of a certain age&#34;.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The story is decent, it manages to keep within the spirit of OZ.<br /><br />The acting is also decent. I didn't feel that anyone was particularly bad...or exceptionally good, either. James Franco comes across as indifferent on occasion, but I feel that that was the nature of the character.<br /><br />It looks very good in HD.<br /><br />Danny Elfman, as usual, puts together a fantastic soundtrack that is appropriate and powerful.<br /><br />I would give this film 4 (possibly 5) stars if not for:<br />1) 130 minutes is too long in this case. The 'decent' acting would be immediately upgraded to 'well done' with  15-20 minutes trimmed (at least, that's how the audience would feel). Every few minutes throughout the first 45 of the film, I was looking at my watch. I even considered turning this off so I could watch 'Ghost Rider 2.' Not because GR2 is better, but because it would waste less time.<br />2) The obvious 3D cinematography. I can't overstate how annoying this is in any film. If I want to feel like I'm \\"in the movie,\\" I'll go to the Disneyland ride, based on the film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these two massive flaws killed it, which is really the most frustrating part of watching OZ: after it's over, you know that there is a great film hiding in there and find yourself disappointed by what could have been.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app!! This is so handy to check on battery state and how charge you have left for gaming, watching videos and listening to music. Also good for showing how long it will take to charge up. Thoroughly recommend it. Buy it!!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The actors hugh and mads are freakin AMAZING!!!!  The directors are great too especially Slade. It is evident t he amount of work and dedication that goes into the show.
B008Y768XO|5.0|True Love<br />True Sadness<br />Once in a lifetime<br />Really a phenomenal movie but a little hard to watch.<br /><br />Great acting.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I found this series to be entertaining and safe for my entire family. Which includes two adults and 4 children ages 10 to 14.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Used to love the \\"old\\" AccuWeather app. It was fast to load, had what I was looking for on one page (two at the most), quickly diplayed animated radar maps, and was ad-free. Recently, however, I openned it and - after an ACHINGLY long time to load - came face-to-face with the cluttered new, \\"improved\\", ad-bedecked cluster flop that is the new AccuWeather app. Ugh! To be fair, I gave it a week to see if it'd grow on me, but it hasen't so I've just deleted this bloated failure from my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Whoever screwed up this once go-to resource should be fired. Especially for wasting valuabe screen space on the absolutely useless \\"My AccuWeather\\". If it's 103 deg here in Dallas, I already KNOW that \\"It's a poor time for DIY\\" and that \\"It's much hotter than [I'd] like\\"! Thanks for nothing and so long. It's now deleted from my tablet.<br /><br />Now it's time to see if anyone still offers a weather app that simply gives the weather now and in the near future. AccuWeather no longer fits that bill for me.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Great plot, great acting and kept my interest throughout the entire movie.  I would recommend this movie.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Probably the best mobile photo editors I've ever seen ... And I've used quite a few.  It also does more thst Judy editing. Collages, add text. Etc.<br />You won't be disappointed.
B008M721MS|3.0|I download Skype and I loved it until I started having problems with<br />it would all of a sudden kick me out and say they didn't recognize my password then I would put in my password and it told me it wasn't right
B009SQRL4U|3.0|Not the best selections, but when I find one that is good, it is something. I like the ease of amazon.com movies though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have seen this show classified as a daytime drama/soap and it is much more than that.<br />The characters are well developed, realistic, and flawlessly acted.
0345529057|5.0|My books came new in their plastic and are well-made. No printing or binding issues. The price was far lower than what I would have to pay in-store. I started watching Game of Thrones this spring and now I'm glad I can read and catch up on the amazing books. 10/10 would recommend
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is awesome and i can always play it whe  im bored!! its my 2nd fav game!!! i just like playing it
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Who wouldn't love Sherlock Holmes? I have had Hard Bound Gold Edition, paper-back edition and now the Digital Edition. They are all delights. Of course one can never compare a Digital Edition to the Limited Edition, Gold Bound book that you can proudly display on your shelf.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I read this book a couple of years ago. Just reread it. After what happened in Cleveland it's very poignant. Extremely well written from child's point of view.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Love the series and couldn't wait for the series to continue .Love it love it download micro my kindle to read over and over
B009CG23TO|5.0|Never get tired of watching this movie or the whole series.  The movie is well written and produced and acting couldn't be better.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Dragonvale was fun, but it took it took up almost half my space on my kindle. You should get it if you have space.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This has become one of our favorite movies. This is a movie that I'll continue to watch many times and for many years.
141659521X|5.0|I very much enjoyed &#34;The Last Man&#34;.  What is really unfortunate is that this is Vince Flynn's last novel.  I found the title to be somewhat prophetic.
B00DHQ208Y|5.0|Just discovered this band and I'm blown away. Cool psychedelic groves reminiscent of the 70's. I love the band... They are amazing!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book & it was a fast read & came @ just the right time as I had just lost my sister-in-law to cancer @ age 58. I'm content.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is great. Fun to play.Only composts is not enough time to claim bongo on the last number called.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|This second season of the classic Upstairs, Downstairs is an update, jumping from the 1920's to the<br />beginning of the Second World War.  It's an entirely different family, but still keeps to the original<br />theme of the contrast between the classes.  It's extremely entertaining among the upper class, not<br />so much among the lower class.  Lots of drama set in a turbulent time...I loved it!
B00821PCJS|5.0|fast moving, enjoyed the actors, plot, etc, etc,etc,etc,etc,etc, don't like to have so many words required to rate the series.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I own this movie, but didn't feel like pulling it off the shelf to watch it so ended up watching it on amazon instead. As a comic book fan and avid reader, this to me is the perfect superhero movie to date. It is full of the usual comic book quirks but keeps a solid story and the characters are all perfectly portrayed, thanks in large part to director Joss Whedon, who has written a few comics for Marvel in the past, so he sure knows what he is doing. It is full of awesome action, comic book fun, great characters, and just enough character moments that it doesn't feel like just another mindless blockbuster.
B00B97TMIE|4.0|I bought this album and love every song on it individually.  As an album, I think it is too scattered and eclectic, so I still don't know who they really are.  I think it would have worked for them to spread out these songs into more themed albums.  But like I said, the songs are all great, it just sounds more like a compilation than a true album.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|I got the free game, and my son loved it.  it said \\"NO ADS\\" on the description.  But as he played and ad to buy the \\"full version\\" kept popping up.  he is 2, and doesn't know how to X out of it.  After 10xs in a row, I bought the full version.  As of right now, I see nothing different from the free one.  Just don't say \\"no ads\\" if you are gonna have ads is all.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|How people give this less than 5 stars is beyond me.  At no time in film history has something like this been attempted and accomplished with such finesse!  This movie puts a more detailed and drawn out spin on one of our favorite childhood stories, Jack and the Bean Stalk.  WELL DONE!  I loved every minute!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|Well it explained the full and entire definition to what I asked!!!<br /><br />Thank you for your help in finding this book.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|- Christmas vacation is my favorite movie in the National Lampoons series with Chevy Chase.<br />- Cousin Eddy, Clark and the family get themselves into some hilarious situations with a holiday twist.<br /> - Blu ray quality picture is a nice touch after watching it on the older tvs back in the 90s!<br />- Qucik delivery and a great price from Amazon!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I have tried using many different apps to manage the storage of my various devices and this is definitely the best. It has a simple, intuitive interface, and great features. Nicely done!
B00CRW2066|5.0|I have a few songs from The National but this is the first full album I purchased.  It is so great! It is kind of dark, so it has been my constant companion as I'm going through a break up.  This is the Last Time, Sea of Love, Fireproof, and Heavenfaced are my favorites.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Reminiscent of the old disco sound like we heard from Le Chic...good dance tune...amazing how sounds get recycled...disco is NOT dead
B004RE29PO|5.0|I've seen them all, but this is the only disc I bought. I can see this one a few times a year.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|i love love love this movie. i dont much like the book as in my opinion Stephenie Meyer can't write worth anything(sorry no offense) but the movies they make out of the books are phenomenal.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a good game. You have to have patience in order for the the game to be free, but yes,it can be free, you just have to be be patient. Force closes a lot though.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|Even despite the age difference between the two games I still prefer the classic Lemmings over this but this is still a really fun game. I love how it doesn't have a timer on it to add to the stress level. I wish there was two levels of fast forward because often times just the one still feels too slow. The tutorial at the beginning of each level isn't very clear. I just have to play it and figure it out for myself. Also I wish you could turn off the hint signs on the level. It makes it a little too easy. Overall it's a good game, an excellent time killer.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|I love this album! There are so many fun songs to drive to on my work commute, and I love how she changes her voice around and touches so many genres.  Really great album.
B00E1942VO|5.0|Great album. Great choice of featured artists. Love it! Very much typical of Five Finger Death Punch. I higly recommend this album.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love this show. I love the plot, the clothing, the characters, everything about it!  There is also a lot of history from the Victorian era as far as customs, world events, etiquette, etc.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this is the best game I ever played in my whole entire young life! you should play this awesome game right now today!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|downton abbey brings back television that is smart and entertaining in subtly sexy way ...without the sex. It shows a side of life when time was about propriety and integrity. It is as addictive as daytime soap operas with the class of shows of a bygone era. This show should inspire other primetime shows on regular television to strive for excellence. Cable is full of smut and shows that you know if you have spent time watching them....you have grown more stupid in that time. I say good job to the executive producers and directors of this show...you have a standing ovation from me...keep up the story and good work that you are doing with downton abbey and hats off to pbs for shows like this one and call the midwife...keep us watching!!!!!!!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It was very uplifting and inspiring. The Alchemist should be required reading in all high schools and colleges.  It is a book that will be read over and over again.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|ok Brandon Fraser again another outstanding performance.... I saw parts of the movie at a friends house and didn't get to see it all,, so I just had to have it!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Much different from the show, but just as entertaining! If you enjoy the Netflix episodes, you'll like finding the characters and spins on events from book to tv.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really fun game! I surprised myself how well I could follow the clues. Felt like Sherlock Holmes!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this hidden object game. Hard to find a good free hidden object games that lets you get farther than the 2nd level.
B00846REIS|4.0|Its very very close to 50 Shades.  I enjoy it very much but not as much as 50 Shades.  Maybe that is because I read 50 Shades first.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|One of the better mystery games I have played, better storyline then most. I would play more games of this type.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|this movie is an updated move / story line about fatal attraction! OUT STANDING PROFORMANCE!  Keep up the good work!

B000DWMYQ8|4.0|The movie starts out slow, but gets much better towards the end. It is worth watching with your wee tribe.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's just like minecraft pc except it's mobile but it doesn't have all the stuff as minecraft pc has but still it's my second favorite minecraft game.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was very technical.Lots of detail over my head.I liked it  though, and would reccomend it to anyone.His experiences were<br />very thought provoking.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The app is great, but I can't play it any more because of the update I still love this app
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Again another outstanding movie...so glad I have this movie in my collection ....and glad I got it!  U SO ROCK!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This and the Dark Knight Returns part 2 are some of my favorite movies.  I like the art direction these films took, especially depicting Batman as a bulky, massive guy that is now dealing with his age against younger opponents.  And the story, of course, has become my favorite among the tales of Batman with an inspiring ending for both films.
B00005JNQS|4.0|I watched this movie several times with my son. We both enjoyed the movie. It is worth watching with your wee tribe.
B0037VNX44|5.0|A journey into the mind of a madmad via one of the greatest actors of our time, Tom Hardy. Don't look for sanity in this film. If you do, you'll miss the point.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|We thoroughly  enjoyed watching this film, again.  It is one of my husbands favorites now.  Grand kids enjoyed it too !
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I'm usually put off by foreign films with subtitles. However, this film grabbed me in the opening scene and kept me glued to the story. It's a story of a wealthy paraplegic and the development of the relationship with his unlikely new care giver. The acting is superb, the storyline is quite different from most modern movies.<br />I rented the movie from Amazon Prime, and as soon as the final credits ended, went to my computer and ordered the DVD. I highly recommend this film and believe you will enjoy it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Again another outstanding movie...so glad I have this movie in my collection ....and glad I got it!  U SO ROCK!
B00004XQ8H|5.0|Lisa Della Casa sings like an angel and the musical accompaniement is so complimentary. The whole production is done with great beauty and taste. It's not surprising why so many people have been knocked out by this performance! The sheer beauty makes it easy on the ear and in a class of its own. Ponselle similarly sang in a pretty & comfortable way. Just a wonderful listen and it's not likely anyone will knock this one out of first place. Lisa owned Strauss........

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, especially the challenges.  I would recommend this game to anyone. It's bananas.  I look forward to a minions 2 game?!!

B002APU580|5.0|I have loved this movie since I purchased it over 5 years ago. This movie turned me onto all of Jane Austen's novels. I recently have a friend whom has become interested in reading these novels, so I purchased this movie for her.

B00CHI5B7A|1.0|Movie was bad enough with every plot cliche' you've ever heard, every gangster reaction you've ever seen, and little to nothing of a creative plot--<br />Then comes Amazon and their sneeky HD additional cost of $4.99<br /><br />BEWARE
B008JFUTUY|5.0|I had read so many good things about Searching for Sugar Man, but something stopped me from watching it until yesterday. I was afraid that it just wouldn't be my kind of thing. Would I like the music? Probably not. Would I care about a musician that I had never previously heard of? Doubtful. Furthermore, only a select few documentaries have captured my imagination to the point where I would watch them more than once.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that all of my doubts were quickly erased within the first few minutes.<br /><br />Sixto Rodriguez was born in Detroit in 1942, and made two albums in the 1970s. The first, Cold Fact, was released in 1970, and Coming from Reality followed in 1971.<br /><br />His singing style was raw, along the lines of Bob Dylan and Neil Young. Like both of those artists, the lyrics carry a lot of meaning, and it's obvious that Rodriguez wrote songs that were both personal and authentic. His US sales were almost non-existent, and, like me, most people weren't aware that he existed before this documentary was put together.<br /><br />Here are a few of his lyrics:<br /><br />Climb Up on My Music<br />Have you ever had a fever<br />From a bitter-sweet refrain<br />Have you ever kissed the sunshine<br />Walked between the rain<br />Well, just climb up on my music<br />And my songs will set you free<br />Well, just climb up on my music<br />And from there jump off with me<br /><br />I'll Slip Away<br />And you can keep your symbols of success<br />Then I'll pursue my own happiness<br />And you can keep your clocks and routines<br />Then I'll go mend all my shattered dreams<br />Maybe today, yeah I'll slip away<br /><br />This is Not a Song, It's an Outburst: Or, The Anti-Establishment Blues<br />The mayor hides the crime rate<br />Council woman hesitates<br />Public gets irate but forget the vote date<br />Weatherman complaining, predicted sun, it's raining<br />Everyone's protesting, boyfriend keeps suggesting<br />You're not like all of the rest<br /><br />Garbage ain't collected, women ain't protected<br />Politicians using people, they've been abusing<br />The mafia's getting bigger, like pollution in the river<br />And you tell me that this is where it's at<br /><br />Woke up this morning with an ache in my head<br />I splashed on my clothes as I spilled out of bed<br />I opened the window to listen to the news<br />But all I heard was the Establishment's Blues<br /><br />Gun sales are soaring, housewives find life boring<br />Divorce the only answer, smoking causes cancer<br />This system's gonna fall soon, to an angry young tune<br />And that's a concrete cold fact<br /><br />The pope digs population, freedom from taxation<br />Teeny Bops are up tight, drinking at a stoplight<br />Miniskirt is flirting, I can't stop so I'm hurting<br />Spinster sells her hopeless chest<br /><br />Adultery plays the kitchen, bigot cops non-fiction<br />The little man gets shafted, sons and monies drafted<br />Living by a time piece, new war in the far east<br />Can you pass the Rorschach test?<br /><br />It's a hassle it's an educated guess<br />Well, frankly I couldn't care less<br /><br />A couple of early interviews in the film report that Rodriguez committed suicide. One account states that he set himself on fire on stage, while another claims that he shot himself after his tiny audience ridiculed his performance. But this is not a sad tale; it's actually extremely uplifting. Please trust me on this.<br /><br />The film explains that Rodriguez was a huge success in South Africa, with a bigger following than Elvis or The Rolling Stones. He was completely unaware of this at the time, and never saw any of the money. His records were initially unavailable, but word spread after bootleg copies were distributed among fans. When the albums were finally released, more than half a million copies were sold. Imagine having all that success without being aware of it. It almost sounds like a hoax or a spoof documentary, doesn't it?<br /><br />In South Africa, people adopted some of the songs and made them part of the anti-apartheid movement. One fan decided to find out the truth about this mysterious man, and made it his mission to discover exactly what happened. He began by tracking where the royalties went, and also visited places mentioned in the songs. While on the verge of abandoning his search, a blog post gave him new hope and a fresh lead. I don't want to reveal what he ultimately found, because you deserve to find out for yourself if you don't already know how the story ends.<br /><br />This is a film for music fans, and for anyone who enjoys uplifting stories. I know that I haven't told you why you need to see Searching for Sugar Man, but you'll be glad you did if you do decide to check it out. It may be the best documentary I have ever seen, and I am already thinking about watching it again.<br /><br />It's not essential to view the film in high definition as much of the 1970s footage is low quality, but the recent interviews do benefit from the Blu-ray treatment, as does the sound quality.sn't it?<br /><br />In South Africa, people adopted some of the songs and made them part of the anti-apartheid movement.

B0097PW7H8|5.0|This title I made this review is very true. Through experience. I've had other battery apps and they were very annoying and pop up every time you plug it in. This app actually did what is supposed to happen and expect when one buys a battery-related app. Does what it's supposed to do and helps you with both charging the battery and preserving its life.
1609611543|5.0|Still working through the book.  Recommend by my lupus doctor.  It is an eye opener. Very interesting and I have tried a couple of the recipes and liked them alot.
B000PGHVC4|3.0|A good reprinted copy, but was advertised as a 1938 edition. It is actually a 1971 Avon reprint. The book is a great book to read, but I was looking for the 1938 first edition.<br /><br />I also purchased another copy that IS a 1938 first edition; however, it was listed as \\"good\\" condition and I would have only given it a fair as the slip cover was significantly eaten bt mice and the binding also shows signs of the same  treatment. Obviously this book had been forgotten in someone's attic and sold off by heirs.
B005LAII4E|5.0|Great movie and plenty of action for all.. Would recomend this movie for all great special affects for all.. Buy it.

145160713X|5.0|Author Walter Lewin is a legend at MIT, teaching physics there for over four decades. He always practiced his lectures at least three times in an empty classroom, with the last rehearsal at 5 A.M. on lecture day. These lessons have been made available on the Internet, and provide an excellent demonstration of the potential value of MOOC courses; Bill Gates reports viewing them and being very impressed.<br /><br />Professor Lewin is particularly renowned for his ability to make concepts plain, combined with the joy he conveys about the wonders of the world and his fascinating demonstrations. 'For the Love of Physics' conveys some of those talents for readers.<br /><br />He begins with some observations about the stars - the Andromeda galaxy, the only one visible to the naked eye, is around 2.5 million light-years away ('next-door' in astronomical terms), and made up of about 200 billion stars. Further out lies the outer reaches of our own Milky Way - another 100 to 200 billion stars. Current estimates are that there may be as many galaxies in the universe as stars in our own galaxy. The largest single structure in the known universe is over a billion light-years across, vs. the observable universe with one's eye is roughly only 90 billion light years across.<br /><br />Of all the matter in our visible universe, only about 4% is ordinary matter, 23% is dark matter (invisible, of unknown composition), and the remaining 73% is called dark energy - also invisible and of unknown  composition. Thus, we're ignorant about 96% of the mass/energy in our universe.<br /><br />The universe is about 137 billion years old - however, some new galaxies formed 400 - 500 million years after the Big Bang, and the edge of the observable universe is now about 47 billion light-years away from us in every direction.<br /><br />Lewin is suspicious of string theory - so far it's untestable and has no predictive power.<br /><br />Then it's on to electricity and magnetism, x-rays, etc.<br /><br />Finally, in other source, Lewin makes some interesting observations about the future of American secondary education. He believes free online university courses will force our less prestigious higher education institutions, which he calls 'trash,' out of business within 20 years. 'There is . . . in this country an enormous scale from the real top (eg. Harvard and MIT) down to universities that are just awful. We have 10,000 colleges in this country, so when you get down to the very bottom, a degree is worth nothing. Students will make their own package by taking courses on edX and other MOOC providers instead of accepting places at less prestigious universities and colleges. There is no other country in the world . . . that has such an enormous sliding scale of 10,000 colleges, whereby you have 10 that are among the very best in the entire world, then at the bottom you have such trash.'/>Finally, in other source, Lewin makes some interesting observations about the future of American secondary education.

B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I thought the title did not fit the book until the second half of it.  But even if that were my only dissappointment with the book it would be enough for the rating.  Don't know it I would recommend this or not.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|This is the first Castle book I've read. I would have liked more action, however, I watch the TV show and the dialogue is pretty much like it on the screen. I could see the characters as I read. I'll give the next book a try.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This has to be about the best one I have ever read. The best description of the Seal training I have read also. I was a  Marine in the late 70's and I have always thought I wish I had done this or that, well after reading this  I'm glad I didn't  try for the Seals, I don't believe I would have made it. This book was so well written, I wish I could have known these men, it's an honor to me to be from the same country. Thank you to all of you.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|From the first time I saw this movie in theatres I was hooked. The plot of each friend killing the other's boss was funny. Jen Aniston's character sexually harassing her dental assistant has me in tears every time. Don't watch this one with kids.

B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Me, my wife and 4 year old were loving this until the update. Suddenly we can't play this game without a WiFi connection! We're very, very disappointed. If this isn't changed soon I'll probably delete the app. What's the point of having a game on here that we can only access while tethered to WiFi.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game ever. I'm. so glad we got the new updates. I can't. wait to see the new areas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I wasnt sure about it at first but when i tried it i loved it! You can choose from a long list of cute and funny avatars and boreds. I have a hard time putting my tablet down. It works great on my kindle with no glitches. Its a fun and addicting game that i would recomend for all ages!

I'm 26 and still obsessed with their old music and it brings be back to High School and those memories.

B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|One of, if not the best multiplayer fps for the android devices.  Controls are smooth and the customizations are a huge plus.  If you are already accustomed to using controls for shooters on touch screens, the competition seems less difficult here making it seem easy to be good than games like modern combat.  Only real things I don't care for is that they want to make you spend money in game for content.  This game is so good it should be one flat payment then you earn everything in game like battlefield.  Also your vehicles are WAY too vulnerable and can be destroyed by just a few shots from any gun.  You end up feeling more like a target than a juggernaut.  Other than that this game is way deserving of mainstream recognition<br /><br />-KyTy

3453268725|1.0|Am giving this ONE star for the fact that they ship fast and DID return my $$ but like the other complaining reviews, The book was in German, Not English which I needed. Details of book were in very small print, they should have made the print bigger so people know what they are buying, with this buyer I would read EVERY little word and however many pages it may be, read thoroughly. Misleading.

B00BEIYMIS|4.0|4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />The best haunted house movie since \\"The Others, but wait, that's not quite fair, because this movie also is one of the best possession films I can remember since \\"The Exorcist!\\" Tense, sharp as a guillotine sliding down it's track to sever your head! Creepy as feeling something bump against your leg in dark muddy water. \\"The Conjuring is a relentless horror film!<br /><br />Yes, it is true, you've seen a lot of these scenarios in other haunted house/possession movies, but \\"The Conjuring\\" turns all the old clich&eacute;s inside out, spinning their heads 360 degrees, until they come falling off & landing in your brain, taking a bite out of your mind! This film works, because it is so literately directed, scripted, & filmed. The acting is top notch, as these characters make you feel their terror! The soundtrack & sound effects massage your fears like a clap of thunder in the middle of the night, jolting your senses with electricity! Yes, \\"The Conjuring,\\" along with \\"World War Z,\\" are the best horror films of the year, easily burying  the gore laden inferior remake to the \\" Evil Dead.\\" Just like \\"World War Z,\\" \\"The Conjuring\\" knows that gore alone does not make the horror film. It knows the true highway to your fears is straight through the mind in a psychological barrage of dread & suspense! One clap from this film, is worth ten bloody mutilations from the new \\"Evil Dead!\\" Why the comparison? Because their both possession films, & if one of them are going to take possession of your fears, it's \\"The Conjuring,\\" possessing you long after you leave the theater, while \\"The Evil Dead\\" is a gore buffet, easily swallowed, digested, & passed through your system & flushed away. \\"The Conjuring\\" is a three course meal of horror, that will stick to your ribs, & if you believe in this sort a thing, \\"The Conjuring\\" based on a supposed true story, may just upset your stomach a tad too.<br /><br />One more thing, if you loved this film, there is a great obscure film fom the 80's with Barbra Hershey, \\"The Entity.\\" Also, supposedly based on true events. I dare you to watch these two back to back, on a dark stormy night!great obscure film fom the 80's with Barbra Hershey, \\"The Entity.\\" Also, supposedly based on true events.

But the viewer's enjoyment of this first-class entertainment is, as with all WWII movies, tempered by the knowledge of the thousands who died trying to cross the North Atlantic. And while most of the German submariners are portrayed sympathetically, viewers from Allied countries won't be able to forget completely the stigma that comes from building one's war career on sneak attacks upon unarmed merchant vessels.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I can't say enough about this book...it's a beautiful story that will stay with you long after you have finished it. Do yourself a favor and walk around in this world, you won't regret it.
0802473156|5.0|Everyone who is &#34;in Love&#34;  should read this book.  It provides great insight into relationships in marriage.  My spouse turned out to speak a different love language than I thought.
B000035P5E|5.0|I first viewed this film many years ago. It was an interesting WWII spy thriller very well done. Donald Sutherland gave an excellent performance as did all the other characters. I'm glad to have it in my library.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I enjoyed the character dialogue, and the additional puzzles that made this game unique from other hidden object games I have played. It was a great choice for the free appnof the DAY!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Second generation in the family, granddaughter (16) loved it!  She can't wait to watch it again and shared her response about it on facebook.  Sometimes mom and grandma are right.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|I enjoyed this book; at a time when the USG is struggling with policy to reduce expenses and infrastructure, it was really interesting to see how Google approached their data centers/ops with a completely different mindset.  I was also surprised that Internet ads can generate so much revenue!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|finally a app that will have music videos i love listing to music and watching there videos so this is a cool app
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|The movie itself is good, but the audio does not match the video so when a character talks, the audio is not in sync.  Would not buy again
1439152799|5.0|Since reading this book, I have read 2 other books by Kate Morton. She is a very interesting and imaginative author. I found the books to be a little slow at the beginning but interesting enough to keep my attention until we got into the meat of the plot. At that point I didn't want to stop reading.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What I loved about this story is despite the sci-fi notion of time travel, I was still engrossed by it's realism....the consequences to changing aspects of history whether the intentions were noble or no. This book was completely unpredictable and had me hanging on every word
B00B7Y0206|5.0|When i was on YouTube, it changed and never worked on me. So i found vtube and it SO worked! Now i can watch full episodes on 1000 ways to die and lots of other videos too! Xoxo, FINALLY! Get this app NOW! And have fun with it too!
0307269752|3.0|I'm not into stories of the thriller genre, but I've heard too much about Larsson's trilogy I was convinced it will be well worth a read. The story is not actually centred around a single girl hero: it's about men doing all kind of horrible acts against women, with a central focus on the Vanger's clan - a financially successful family from the outside, but a completely dysfunctional one (with some fascist tendencies) from the inside.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Salinder, the girl with the many tattoos (each one possibly representing a certain traumatic event in her life) have ugly problems with every kind of authority possible: guardian authorities, police authorities, tax authorities, teachers, psychiatrists, and even bars body guards. It's just as if all of these people exist for the only purpose of making her life miserable.<br /><br />Mix all of the above with a financial journalist whose life work is unveiling corruption in Swedish firms and you get a story that cannot be easily put down!<br /><br />Two stars are removed due to the unfortunate bad quality of the English translation, and Salinder's almost-non-existing character development.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Of course, this my call.  But if you like silents and haven't watched Metropolis, I recommend it.<br /><br />There is a strong amount of biblical similarities in this movie.  The vision of Moloch is especially disturbing in my opinion.  The<br />Sons of the Fathers glow with good health and vigor.  There is a scene in which the star of the movie goes to a club that clearly represents a brothel.  A weird one.  And that is where he first sees the girl and the children from
076781326X|4.0|good video and audio.  I am glad I bought this movie and would buy more.  Don't know what more to write.
1451695195|5.0|It renews and reinforces our belief in God. The critics of religion and God can talk all they want - but they don't have any such written confirmation of their sad beliefs! This book is just the latest in a whole group that reinforces such events. Atheists can complain all they want but their poor souls are in mortal and immortal danger.
B0016LTNL4|5.0|Anything with Matthew Macfadyne in it is ok with me.  Starts out funny and gets even more funny at the end.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This book alternates the ups and downs of Thor. This what happens when a young man is trying to find his destiny and his powers. Did anyone eat besides the feasts? How about the leopard? Or what about bathing?
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|The fantasy sections in this book depict some pretty rough stuff.  Although what I read was well written and with intriguing characters, the events were too sinister for my taste.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|This movie is well written! Anthony Hopkins is very scary with his intelligence and viciousness! Ryan Gosling is probably at his finest! his character's intelligence and the fact that he takes the &#34;minnow&#34;description of his character,by a ruthless man....and presses onward....it's a pleasure to watch! the ending is great,but you almost want Hopkins to go berserk and scream and rage! Now he is trapped in his own making! perfect!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fast paced. Earn more games. Different locations with different accents. Fun. Challenging. Captures your attention. Exciting.  Hand and eye coordination.
B0085OELXK|3.0|Interesting characters and good story, if not a little complex and confusing at times. Matt Damon and Jude Law are great in this one.
B007SGM084|5.0|The book is a very good read.  It not as book I'm usually in to but once I started the book I found It very hard to put the book down.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|GREAT STORY AND CANT WAIT FOR A SEQUEL AND OF COURSE THE 3D WAS FANTASTIC AND WOUULD WATCH IT OVER AND OVER
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This is my second time to watch the series. After seeing the end, the beginning makes much more sense! I love this show!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun for the whole family and graphics are great never blurry. I personally think that it is a great game for the whole family of all ages.
B000031XCR|4.0|She really rocks this CD.  I can't get enough of her voice.  The only reason I did not give her a 5 star ratings was the insert to the CD only had half the words to the songs.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I love the controller and would highly recommend getting one. if you need lenth but don't want a wavebird or 3rd party controller than this is the one for you. (or if you want a white controller like me)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Amazing game. Can't wait for them to make another. Graphics are great, really makes you feel like you are the one in the game.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|THE 3D EFFECTS WERE ASTONISHONING AND WELL WORTH THE PRICE I PAID FOR THE MOVIE I ALREADY SEEN IN 2D
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Great chemistry. Unique spin on old concept. I liked that they explored histories of both main characters in first episode.
034580404X|5.0|I would definetly recomend this book collection to anyone looking for a good reading!! the story is very interesting to read
B004GYY714|5.0|Good App for what it does, I use for the one radio station I listen to and it is good for that station.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I really enjoy watching the show. I am just mad that young people keep dying. I recommend that others check it out.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|It really is difficult to watch a movie with Leslie Nielsen in it and not think of his comedic roles (Naked Gun movies, and Airplane for example).  However, that being said, this is probably the greatest science fiction film of the 1950's.  From the introduction of Robbie the Robot to the public, to its fabulous special effects, this one is the Gold Standard for all science fiction movies of the 1950's.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|GREAT STORY WITH GREATER SPECIAL EFFECTS WORTH THE TIME TO WATCH A SECOND AND EVEN A THIRD AND FORTH TIME
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My mother got me hooked! I watched the first two seasons in one weekend! I'm one episode short of season 3, but I don't want to finish because I don't want to have to wait for season 4. Drama, mystery, romance and sometimes humor so well done.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Great App for viewing all your written and other denouements that come in PDF FORM. Very useful app. Get it if receive documents on the fly.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best series on law since dimwit TV executives cancelled Boston Legal. Worthy of your time for past season watching and current recording.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I like it very much, the movie well made it was what I expected and It was deliver prontly<br /><br />thanks
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Very repetitive. Predictable. Kept reading hoping for a big ending. Unsatisfying. It was as though the author just decided to quit. Still don't know who the murderer was. Maybe I'm stupid but I need a more concrete finish. NOT a Grisham!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|great time killer trying to beat your score time is the only obstacle need more bonuses to get anyware.me but
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a lot of fun whether your bored or not. I love listening to music while playing subway surffers very much
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I liked the perspective that this book is written in. It is written first person from a lady suffering from early on set alzheimers.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Show offers a good look at the other side of the law.  Typically lawyers are thought of as demons but after watching a season or so of this, you begin to see how cut throat it all is and how hard they have to work to get things done
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I could not get this game to down load it was stuck attempting to download but just was not. It would not work at all.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|this is by no means an epic retelling of war and peace but i enjoyed it and this was my second viewing... die hard fans are going to have a series of issues with it but as a summer fun movie i highly recommend it... i know i will be watching it again in the future...
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I had to have this movie on DVD.  It is one of my favorites.  I really like the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.
B004NSVF7C|3.0|I thought the man who loved books was a real character, but I also thought the women that interviewed him was just as crazy or strange.  An odd book, but to some would be very interesting.
1843793792|5.0|I have read all of Georgette Heyer's books, and when I saw that Richard Armitage was reading some of them for CDs, I couldn't buy them fast enough.  A warning, though - you will get so caught up in listening to the reader that you may lose the story line from time to time.  Never mind - just back up and listen again.  Excellent purchase!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was just as riviting as the first two. I read it in 1 day, I couldn't put it down
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses. Really. When I saw this game I thought rip off. No it's free. I spend hours playing on it. I recommend all horse lovers this game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very surprising season. Some very interesting twists. Great show and a great season.  I would recommend this DVD to others
0812993292|5.0|A very touching story of someone who had lived a very insular life and who suddenly got it into his head to do something of value to him.  The reactions of the people he met on the way were great and inspiring and it was very well written.  Made me feel good.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|Following \\"The Eternal Idol\\", Tony Iommi is really inspired with the additions of Cozy Powell on drums and Neil Murray on bass.  The band is different and so is the sound.  But, \\"Headless Cross\\" is a great metal album.<br /><br />I think it should proudly stand beside \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Vol. 4\\", \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", Sabotage\\", \\"Heaven And Hell\\", and \\"Mob Rules\\".  (There is nothing wrong with the other Sabbath albums, but those named are my favorites.)<br /><br />Another \\"must have\\" for true Sabbath fans.  Rock On!!!
B009K0P10K|5.0|We are hooked on revenge, I just hope we don't end up waiting for episodes to come out on the regular channels.
B000JMK8R4|2.0|Very shallow and not very convincing comments nor advices, overall a great idea but poorly executed. This is not really a book, it is more like a collection of marketing like &#34;deep&#34; ideas with attached selling images. A collection of not so great ads.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|Brian Ming Blvd find disk bingo into McMinn concert coach Jack Jay I Hogg Gucci doc did find iT very
B003XDZN8A|5.0|I had another pair of Crocs that almost fell off my foot.  I have very narrow feet and the other ones were much too wide.  This pair is exactly what I wanted, they take a little effort to get them on, but when on, they fit and stay on I cannot walk out of them.  They are perfect.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|New Deep Purple is OUT!!!  Now, I have to see them live.<br /><br />I have been collecting Deep Purple for awhile now.  I love that they still record.  I love hearing Steve Morse on guitar.  I think he is the best man they could have picked for the job of replacing Ritchie Blackmore.  And I think it sounds as if they really enjoy rocking with each other.<br /><br />If you haven't already bought them, check out &#34;Rapture of the Deep&#34;, and &#34;Bananas&#34;.  They all rock!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|seriously - as an adult, i should not be enjoying this game as much as i am. but i am. downloaded it out of curiosity but cant stop playing it. haahaha. v impressed with the design &amp; gameplay.
B0000541B2|5.0|This is a much higher-quality game pad than bunch of ones made for Windows PCs. Use it with a USB adapter and you have a really nice and durable controller for arcade/emulated games.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|I got this app on my kindle fire. I love this game but the tokens that come with a purpose of a lps product cant be in use. You need to have a functional rear camera which a kindle fire dose not have. There for  the tokens are of no use. Which also means I can't have all the pets because the tokens unlock some pets. I wish the creators of this app would make it possible to use the front camera and not the rear!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The was a great game. Can't wait for more rooms to be added. Hard but not overly so. I'm going to let my son try it next
B000000QFV|5.0|The same band as &#34;Headless Cross&#34; gets together for &#34;TYR&#34;.  I purchased this cd while trying to assemble all the lesser known Sabbath recordings.  I remember holding this Lp in my hands when it was first released, and I thought, when will Iommi give it up?  But, I didn't know any better.  I never heard any of the releases since Dio left.<br /><br />Listening to these late 80s/early & mid 90s releases, you will hear some terrific riffing from Iommi, as well as great singing from Martin and Powell's powerhouse drumming.<br /><br />Another &#34;must-have&#34; for Sabbath fans.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this, but it ends up that its one of the best things I have ever watched.
B000002GYW|5.0|This is not just a CD, but it is a work with a theme told in the format of some great music.  This has some great songs that you never hear on the radio, and they are just too good not to have in your collection.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game has been the one of the best games I've played in a long time. If I had to recomend a game it would be this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really a lot of fun!  Difficult enough to make me think a little but not impossible.  Highly recommend to all ages
B004222UC8|5.0|Everybody knows Ozzy's stuff and Dio's stuff, but all Sabbath fans need to check out the Tony Martin-era stuff.  He was an unknown singer from Birmingham, England whom Tony Iommi almost hired for his \\"solo\\" album, \\"Seventh Star\\". (\\"Seventh Star\\" only featured 'Black Sabbath' on the cover because his record label would not release his solo effort without the band name on the cover.\\"Seventh Star\\" features Glenn Hughes on lead vocals.)<br /><br />Well, Iommi went back to Tony Martin (after he ditched Ray Gillen right toward the end of the \\"Eternal Idol\\" sessions!!!) and the set is great!<br /><br />What's cool about the deluxe edition is that it includes the Ray Gillen material, as well, as the bonus disc.  And some of these versions are really good, too.<br /><br />Check it out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I finally received this yesterday and loved it simplicity. Before buying I read lot of negative comments regarding comparisons with Roku or Apple TV but I disagree with all of them now. This is simple Chromcast device stream Youtube and Netflix from multiple device without any sophisticated control. Although many other app-makers already working on Chromecast support . Only two kind of people right now bashing chromecast who doesn't get Netflix code and second one who doesn't have it.<br /><br />PS: I am able to play videos from hosting bulk , Videoweed from chrome browser and loved it more but still I would bought it as Youtube Streamer alone. Just Loved simple setup and able to cast videos from IPhone and Android.<br /><br />Update: I am disappointed with Google eco to produce more supported app. Recently bought roku2 XS for 45 bucks and blown away by contents and app. Also Roku have Twonky app which perform function like beaming from iPhone and Android even better you can beam your photos, videos and music etc. Currently, I am happy with Roku 2 XS and using more over my chromecast.
B00CUG8GAS|5.0|This was definitely a most enjoyable read. Not without drama or heartache but filled with most amusing anecdotes of life in the then Rhodesia at the time of the wars of independance.Gladly award it the 5 stars and would like to recommend it to eveybody that loves a story told with wit  and charm
B009DCOU9S|4.0|If you are looking for an extra cool and sneaky game that you can devote your time ta find out every single awesome level and take your time to think and find out the answer then your in luck cause this game is what your looking for and I know not alot of people will devote a lot of time to this game but it's worth it.
1932100660|4.0|This was recommended to me by a close friend.<br />I recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand how important the right foods are to sustained good health. Medical bills go down, energy goes up!
B00DU74U74|3.0|After reading the book, I expected more. My son, who hadn't read it, kept asking what was going on. It was hard to follow and the acting wasn't up to par, my husband asked if the lead character had a split personality. I had to explain to him the host's resistance. The book was really good, but I was disappointed in the movie. It was like the movie expected the audience to have read the book. I just didn't &#34;feel&#34; it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a really fun game but you should get it on alpha black market because it is free on it
B00632HWOG|1.0|Contacts don't auto fill like they used to.  Then this week it stopped loading my new emails.  Had to reinstall each time to get emails to download. It has worked fine until just recently on my Kindle Fire.  Do not know if it is just my device but looks like a few others are having trouble with emails not loading.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This Novel was at first very difficult for me to get use to reading from a 5 year olds point of view but then I got used to it. The book was very intriguing and I love how the innocence of a young child is displayed in the type of situation that he was in
B005PK57NU|5.0|Originally I started watching this series in Las Vegas. Being hooked from the beginning I've made it a part if my week to week routine. It's very well written, and the actors are great at portraying the script like its real life.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end - the ending allows for some really interesting conversation, too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love Despicable Me minions and you love Run Games like Temple Run or Subway Suffers; then you will definitely love this game. I would recommend this game to anyone I know......which is exactly what I'll do.
B007LGPSX0|3.0|Loved the series when it was on TV.  Only wish you had series years 2-10 on Kindle that's why I gave it 3 stars.  Hope we see the following years soon on Kindle!
0525953728|5.0|Enjoyed the book and circulated it to others who also enjoyed it.  Very enlightening and holde the reader's interest from start to finish.
B004T0E2S8|1.0|Do not buy this app from Amazon. You cannot update to the newest version of the app after downloading. This is a neutered version of the version you can buy for the same price in the Google Play store. This version never worked on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 running Android 4.1.1. You can download it, but it will crash immediately upon trying to interact with the app. Save yourself the wasted money and hassle of trying to get it back. Go to the Play store and get the newest, updated, full version of this app. If you buy this from the Amazon Appstore, you WILL REGRET IT. The buyer's remorse is strong with this one.
B008M721MS|4.0|My wife likes it, because is good to connect to family. also could be used any times. Like it very much
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|My wife and I watch a lot of movies. So we (like everyone else in the theater) are subjected to the trailers that begin each feature.<br /><br />The trailers for Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby looked awful, frenetic and shallow. Plus, we saw them month after month after month after month. We got sick of them. And we started to wonder why the trailers were being shown (seemingly) 6-9 months before the movie was released. That had to be a bad sign.<br /><br />Fresh out of even half-way decent movies to watch, we thought we'd give The Great Gatsby a try. But not at the first-run theaters. We waited until it appeared at the local cheap theater.<br /><br />In fact, \\"we\\" didn't wait for it at all. I went to see it by myself while my wife out of town on business. I didn't want to waste another $3.99 on a ticket for her.<br /><br />The movie blew me away. It was compelling, emotional, creative, and seemingly very in tune with the spirit of Fitzgerald's book. The ending moved me greatly. I left the theater stunned.<br /><br />When my wife returned from her business trip, the first thing we did was go see The Great Gatsby.<br /><br />She was as moved as I was.<br /><br />We left (me, after seeing it a second time) vowing to buy the Blu-ray the day it comes out.<br /><br />I doubt we'll ever be big DiCaprio fans. He's just not that good of an actor. But Carey Mulligan is always a treat, and the rest of the cast was decent, too. Even Tobey McGuire, another actor we don't particularly care for.<br /><br />Yet, all of them together work. The whole movie works. The Luhrmann style captured the craziness of the era without going overboard into a too-busy, too-loud movie.<br /><br />This version of The Great Gatsby beats the 1974 movie starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. By a long shot. Compared to this version, the Redford/Farrow film looks even more lame. And it was pretty darn lame.<br /><br />My advice is this: Give it a try. Go see it at a second-run theater. Or buy the movie when it's released. It's a very good film, far more compelling and accessible than Luhrmann usually is, and quite a good yarn.<br /><br />As for me, I'll buy this Blu-ray version the day its released...and watch it a third time. It really is that good.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|For the price you are getting a full game. Great story telling, full range of monsters. Multiple maps, airships, mini games, and ultimate boss fight. Not as complex as some other FF titles. If your new to FF or just burned out on 100+ hour RPGs. Can find all info you may need to complete the game online. As someone who has a lot of hours into the FF games this one is a nice change.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|If you like roaming games you need this game! It is a great game. This is a marvel lover type game.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the little minions.  Our family is Despicable Me fans so this game has gone over well in out home.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|The game is simple but so far it's fun and entertaining. The characters are unique and have a surprising amount of detail..
B000HL2J0G|4.0|An action figure without multipy weapons is hard to accept in these days went firepower is all the rage. But MacGver is compasionate and gets the job done in a ususally believable manner. In current series, even with the firepower, the bad guys are amazingly bad shots, which is less believable The writting is shallow but easy to follow. Relaxing and entertaining. I will enjoy more MacGyver episodes.
B00BB8OHMW|4.0|This is a blast.  I think Shakespeare wrote and lived like this.  Open a bottle of wine and enjoy the &#34;culture&#34; and the evening.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great Christian Movie for the entire family. Wonderful values and great entertainment. An option for Christians from the tired sitcoms and lousy Hollywood movies.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The game has multiple fun modes, challenges you to get better, and is hard to put down.  This game is worth it.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs, or &#34;Nerd Jesus&#34; as Bill Burr joked, is presented in a rather unflattering light to most people in this biography. I was at first skeptical, as I am of every biography published soon after the subject's death or even while they are still among the living. Jobs gave Walter Isaacson, the author, full authority to write with impunity and not to let him read it until it was done. The reason I said &#34;most people&#34; above is because I found a great deal of Jobs's life admirable and role-model worthy for one who wishes success in life. Not that berating people is necessary as Jobs often did; he took what he wanted and went too far in pushiness, feeling time is limited, as it truly is for all. I felt a surge of energy to Do Great Things while reading, just like Steve Jobs. For inspiration alone I recommend this book.<br /><br />On the same token, it is good many are not &#34;Steve Jobs.&#34; I don't think most would want to be a &#34;Jobs&#34; type. The constant drive and prickly personality are not for the many in society. Jobs was wired differently from the majority, both pro and con that at least makes for a highly compelling read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game for building things on the go. I l-o-v-e mine craft and ecspecially now that it has updated and we can change skins, and game modes, and much much more! Definetly worth the 7 dollars!!!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Great special effects and storyline. Very creative to bring this old fable into a whole other dimension that can please the whole family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing and I luv it and hope they can update it in new colors!!! :D I'm in love with the game and wish it will be around when I'm like 80

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I freaking love you Mr. John Green. Never stop writing. Never stop because you understand me better than I understand  myself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super and despicable. This game is mega fun. It is a must play. You will love it. If I love it, then you will love it, because I am very picky about my apps. The least you can do is try it.
B000HZD168|5.0|Awesome movie. A classic Gene Roddenberry film, that has inspired sci-fi movies for more than a decade. This is a keeper.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Better than I thought..Relate-able movie with a lot of funny scenes. I didn't realize it would be a tear jerker
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing it triggered my emotions and most books don't. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes adventurous books
0762777931|5.0|I have been a vegan for almost a year now, but I haven't always made the healthiest decisions when it comes to food. She really put into perspective what you should eat and what you foods you should stay away from. After reading this book, which was very well written, I find myself making healthier food choices and eating a ton more greens because I know how beneficial they are. The book is colorful, and humorous at times which makes it an easy read. She talks a lot about alkalizing the body and staying away from acidic foods, which was new and very interesting information to me. If you are considering buying this book and you are not a vegan, I feel like Kris could convert you if you really listen to what she has to say!
B00AEFXCLU|5.0|I love sci-fi, fantasy movies so I thought I would watch this one.  I was very surprised at how good it was.  I loved the whole concept of the film and I think anyone who like this genre will like this movie.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|I had heard it wasn't that good. they were wrong. It started out kind of slow and the back story ( black and white part) was way too long, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie. and I am not a big fan of Wizard of Oz either.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I am requiring a good review because of the outstanding process of the Oxford American Dictionary. I think that their book has great quality and deserves a success for their books
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|If you like to think and have fun at the same time, this one is for you!!<br /><br />It's highly addictive.  :-)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I play this game all day it is really fun and I think the dragons are so cute I highly suggest it
B00005JMXX|5.0|My list of favorite movies would fill a book but this one would be in the top 20.  I love the story line and the FX are really good.  Except for the wolves.  They looked CG.  BUT, don't let that discourage you from buying or renting this movie.  Great movie.
B004JMY312|5.0|This is still the perfect family movie.  Granddaughter had never seen it. We both loved it.  Amok amok amok. Great
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love this app i just wish everybody coul  hav  thi  app its easier than going onto youtube.com. just sayin
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I love the [close, nearly close] factual information found in this made-for-TV series.  It simply brings the past to life!  The real Henry VIII of course what a fat old guy making The Tudor's Henry Brian Kirk a pleasing eye catcher.  The costumes, backgrounds, castle life, etc., all very inspiring.  Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the second best game... the first is minecraft my<br />opinion ... u should buy this app it is funny and easy at the end!!!! take advice from me!  also check out minecraft!!!!
0142420891|5.0|This book is haunting and inspiring. I learned about new music and a renewed passion for some music I haven't listened to in a while. The characters are lovely, human and so strong. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B005QYKD4I|2.0|The story line was so so but I thought the acting was overall bad and many characters mis  cast especially the lead male role.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Very cool game fun and exciting<br />I play it all the time where ever we go you always lose track of time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I so loved this book!! It covers a couple of very serious subjects but its handled beautifully....You won't be disappointed with this series!! Make sure and read the follow-up Losing Hope!!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Fairway solitaire is a very good time waster and I can not seem to stop.  my other half says I spend more time with the game than I do with him!!!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I remember play Metal Gear &amp; Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake with my cousins when I was a kid. Now I'm 33 and I can never get enough Snake. All of today's hugh first and 3rd person shooters owe everything to Metal Gear, from aim down sites, to taking dog tags, it all starts with Metal Gear. These 8 games are for anyone young and old, who wants a challenge and just wants a great shooter. Then this game is for you.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|I love that they aren't always serious. Outstanding actors and actresses. Great writers and tidbits of comedy thrown in. Wish they had more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Simple but fun. I'm addicted and play more than my 8 year old! Frequent rewards keep you motivated and I can't wait to fill in puzzle pieces.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always wanted a horse and now it is like I got I clean it feed it and ride it I hope that they make a second one for free I would have totem it in a heartbeat
B000NIVJEU|5.0|For the life of me I can not figure out why a movie such  as this was not as successful in the box office. I thoroughly enjoyed it
0470474874|4.0|I have only read the information I needed to solve a problem. Good Book however not for a beginner. Pretty advanced for a new user of Excell
B00BXKKNFS|3.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle, but then found the reason I had suddenly been bombarded with ads in the first place, so I deleted the program that was giving me the unwanted ads and hence, did not any longer need adblock.  I will say, however, I use Adblock on my PC with my Firefox browser, and LOVE it!!!!  I don't have to put up with ads, even on Facebook!
B005PK57NU|5.0|This show is one of the best where the title does not do it justice. I watch the show for Kalinda and Mr. Gold the rest of the storylines and actors are just fillers
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Another great movie adapted very well from book ,If I am not mistaken H G Wells Grandson over saw the production of this movie.
B004LWZW24|4.0|This movie scared me spitless. I'm pretty good about scary movies, but this one freaked me out. Not a lot of gore , violence or foul language. Just an eerie feeling throughout that built up to a fantastic climax. I'm a James Wan fan for life.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great clock when you need an alarm.  Lots of choices of songs or alarms as wake up call... Adjust the volume etc too... Nice app.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|First time \\"down under\\" as well. Enjoyed the scenery as well as the bit of history that Nesbo provides...  Very good indeed...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. its good for you if you are bored a lot. its very fun to compete. have fun!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Hadn't heard of Pintrest until my daughter told me about it, really enjoy looking up my favourite things and being able to have them all in one place to look at whenever I want, would highly recommend
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this clock. It's the best app I have, and the most used. I love the music to fall asleep to and the alarm wakes me up each morning. I don't have an actually clock so this app works like a real clock. I've tried others, and they were not as good as this one!
B003VANOFY|1.0|Sounds good, but connection is INCREDIBLY shaky especially in high-traffic environments.  The battery goes to absolute garbage after about a month of daily usage, see &#60;1 hour of charge. So it's not really &#34;wireless&#34; much any more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is really fun and addicting  but i wish you didnt have to have a facebook account to complete some quests
1781162646|5.0|This is a quick read with the typcal Steven King writing that pulls you right into the story.  As usual his characters are written so well you feel like you know them.  Great fun.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Is just the type of game to keep you interested and coming back for more. Just wish that the energy it takes to play apuzzle wa less
B00CK6MUSW|5.0|The first one I have read of this author and couldn't put it down --- and it won't be the last. Whilst reading this I happened to watch an interview with Mary and the fact this book was released this year (2013) plus she is now aged 85 years old and bright as a button. Wow!  In the book quite a few characters, it was gripping and recommend it to all who like a good mystery.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have tried most available Mahgongg games. This is by far the best one that I have played. It is a great game with all the themes available.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|The beginning of this book gives insight as to Dr. Frankl's time in 4 concentrations camps of Nazi Germany. Very interesting the way he chose to attempt to maintain his &#34;self&#34;. The last part gives insight to his theory( ?) of Logotherapy. very interesting.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Couldn't wait to start the next one. Downloaded it right away. Am really looking forward to the TV series!!! x
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works as described, but is still a ridiculous rip off considering what it is. I am not sure what the advantages are to the new slimmer magsafe 2 adaptor, but I do know it comes off unintentionally at a higher rate than previous models. Perhaps Apple's only consideration was the fraying.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Having read deeply into modern history of science, I was excited to come to understand the history from ancient times to the beginning of the 19th century. The tracing through the persons and the Church using &#34; On the Nature of Things&#34; as the unifying theme helped to see where many philosophers i have read fit into the timeline--especially Montagne. The tie-in to Shakespeare was exciting to see. I found that the knowledge of Monastic life I had picked up from Eco's &#34;Name of the Rose&#34; made reading of Poggio's experiences much more meaningful. I have already downloaded an English translation of Lucretius's &#34;On the Nature of Things&#34; to read the whole poem.
0385486804|4.0|Excellent account of the fateful life and last trip of Christopher McCandless, a seemingly privileged youth who gave up his family and what money he had to pursue his ill fated dream.  Light on knowledge and full of youthful idealism, young Chris took a road which ultimately lead to his demise in the Alaskan wilderness. We will never know exactly what made Chris make the choices he did, all we know is an intelligent, empathetic young man is dead following what some consider his &#34;folly&#34;.
B00C7KXUOE|3.0|It's a different take than the other stories of Hannibal, it's starts much earlier than Silence of the Lambs, but it's not my cup of tea.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Starts a bit slow but ramps up and finishes strong.  Definitely a good read and quite entertaining.  I get surprised very little and the end surprised me a bit.
0385474547|5.0|Once you get passed the unfamaliar names ( and you will), you will see how western missionaires managed to screw up a society in Africa.  It's a tremendous work that allows us to understand a tribal culture and the impact of outsiders on its way of life.  You will come away from this read with a new perspective.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|All the characters are so well developed thru out the episodes. You want to come back and see the next installment. I am a big fan of this kind of series.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I'm a Sci-Fi fan and and this movie is great. If you are used to sci fi in general you'll probably figure out the huge plot point within a couple of minutes of the movie starting, but you'll still have to continue watching to understand why that is the case.<br /><br />This isn't your standard post apocalyptic alien invasion movie. It has a little bit more brains. The setting is fantastic, the environment and cinematography is fantastic. Acting is ok, action is great, and the over arching plot point, really sets it apart from your standard &#34;Aliens invade en mass and try to kill us.&#34; There is a far more intelligent methodology. What makes it work is the perspective that the move is told from. Meaning Tom Cruises characters's perspective is a unique take on a classic theme. Give it a shot.
B005H9B2CE|2.0|Poor acting, not enough action. The story kind of failed at the end.  Ok for kids, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I loved the entire series!!!!!!!  Followed up with buying all books and have enjoyed reading them over and over; very enjoyable!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The speech was great. Very enjoyable series. Locale is wonderful acting is superb. Great dialog very entertaining tv series. Can't wait for more.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|I have not finished reading it, but the summary shows that it is a good write up. Good job Chi
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I understand films will never be as good as the book. But this film takes creative liberties to an all time high. It's nothing like the book and is generally just a bad movie. I read the book, my husband didn't. We watched the movie together and he thought it was a bit dull and slow. He did say the supernatural effects were done well. I was immediately put off by the casting and lack of casting. You simply don't meld two important characters into one and leave out others all together. The screenplay was written by the director, and I don't think he read the book at all. Even the simple love story was weak.  This adaptation makes Twilight look like Fight Club.
1476733953|3.0|A fantastic concept and a well rounded world.  Wool is a fascinating read, a novel that really shows where post-apocalyptic stories can go.  However, I found the plotting a little tedious - specifically, it felt as if not much happened in great swathes of the book.  More action was needed.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, what is there not to love? Looking forward to seeing number two this weekend!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I absolutely loved this entire series.  There was a bit of a lull in the middle, but those books set up a complex and exciting finale.  Brandon Sanderson is officially my new favorite author, bravo!  Robert Jordan would be proud of the way the incredible fantasy world he created evolved in Sanderson's capable hands.
0385737955|5.0|Basically, I saw photos of the movie they were making of The Maze Runner, and just bought it to see what it's all about. Thank God I did, this is definitely one of the best book of my collection.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Still goes back removing what you earned sometimes , frustrating. To easy to accidentally use clusters especially during  fusion.  But overall a good game to play.<br />:
B001MKQS4O|5.0|Read &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; when it first came out and LOVED it! Had no idea how strange Truman was though!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|My son and I love this movie. Is not your typical princess in distress gets saved by the prince. Merida is brave and adventurous.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I think this documentary should have been cut into 2 different films- the first part is all about Sound City studio, rock-n-roll history, the rise and fall of the unique studio. The 2nd part is more of \\"whatever happened to that cool mixing board that was once in Sound City?\\"- now in a different studio, but still in use like it was in it's glory days.<br /><br />If you are a musician, music history buff, film maker, or just like a cool story- you will enjoy Sound City.
B00000612Q|2.0|My copy of this album was intact as far as the quality of the recording. But, the jewel case was BADLY cracked and I have had to try to repair it with tape. NOT satisfactory!!!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I  wouldn't want to be without it.  Easier use.  Protects glass kindle.  Beautiful red color.  Smart looking accessory.  PERFECT all-around usage.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Excellent show! If you are into Science Fiction with good actors that really draw you in, you must see Firefly!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Loved this book! Truly a classic book for mid elementary readers and adults alike. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves to read science fiction or wants to branch out of their normal reads
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After the first episode I was hooked and watched an episode every night. . Can't wait for the next season.
B00AB12TEI|5.0|Applying the Business Model canvas to your life and you as a person is easier said than done but is a highly effective way of viewing your life. Business is all about getting the best out of available resources and with time being the most precious resource for us as individuals, this book applied will allow you to spend it on more fulfilling actions.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|The app was great when I obtained it a year ago. The modifications to the app requiring signing into the app store has made the app worthless to me.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Wow, every so often you get a blu-ray with no faults whatsoever. Magnificent audio, marvelous video, superb relaxed editing, & a set list only a bunch of superstars could put together. All the classics, a few fresh newer songs & a whole bunch of great songs from their solo careers(luv ya' Joe!) make this disc a total winner.I wish all my discs had the beautiful audio mix you hear here. 5 stars doesn't seem enough, it ranks with the best of the best. Nuff said.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I really enjoyed American Gods but I couldn't help but feel like the narrative wove  a little thin in parts. As much as I appreciate the 'flavour' that results from the stories and descriptions of ancient Gods it often felt like Gaiman was building up some larger story that the novel never really delivers on. It felt like a movie in that I couldn't shake the feeling the author was structuring it so it would fit in a two hour time span (keeping with the comparison) rather than fully exploring the plot.<br /><br />That said, overall it was a great read.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Great option as a rss reader! I've been uding it since they discontinued google reader, and I love it. Highly reccomend it, you won't regret it
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Solid horror, well worth a $3.99 rental, that will make you cringe due to gore. However there is almost zero storyline and the story moves very fast. It has to, the movie is only 1:35 minutes long. At one point I could not even count the number of characters there were in the group about to die.<br /><br />What was missing here is that while I did not have time to like any characters in this movie, the weakness was I had no time to get to hate any either. So the enjoyment of watching the guy or girl that you hate \\"GET IT\\" --was highly missed through out.<br /><br />I will say that the shortness of the movie is a godsend in what goes for horror these days, since they skipped the T & A, topless scenes and the usual teen scholck. Glad to see producers Sam Raimi (original 1981 story writer) and Bruce Campbell (star of the original Evil Dead 1981, Evil Dead 2 1987 and Army Of Darkness 2002) decided to leave the usual 30 minutes of teen angst / sex out. Thank you Sam and Bruce!<br /><br />I give this one 3.5 stars and recommend the rental, but not the purchase. I could also give it a 4 stars for a zero boob count, but since not one shock scene made me jump, not even once, this only gets a 3.5.
B0061S0A64|4.0|It's a bit hard to get used to, as all the options aren't explained so you just have to go through and click everything...but once you get the hang of it, this app is really very addicting! I love creating beats with it and hearing the music grow!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Pretty challenging and not just a hidden object game. It has a variety of puzzles to figure out so you are not doing the same thing over and over. I wish they were more like this.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown is an exceptional novelist who doesn't cut corners! I absolutely love his character, Robert. I'm off to read Inferno now!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|The Description doesn't lie. Not this time at least! This app is great and lets you do things that Minecraft PE wouldn't let you do. Pro Version is better but free is just fine! Absolutely Five Stars! Sure, It's hacks but the hacks are fun and don't break the game at all. You go Zhuowei Zhang!
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|I just saw the statue on oneringnet/and its beautiful,.( Riddles in the dark )u have gollum sneaking down behind Bilbo .they did a beautiful job,can't wait to see it in 3D again! !!!!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I love the Royal Envoy games on the computer, so I decided to try it for my Kindle, and its just as good.  The graphics are awesome and the story itself is fun.  I only wish the free trial was longer.  If I didn't already have the full version on my computer, I would buy the full Kindle version.
1439181780|3.0|This provides nothing earth-shatteringly new in comparison to The Secret, in my opinion.  It rewords the same affirmations and encourages the same thought processes.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|The app is Youtube on the Kindle Fire. This app works so much better than just using the browser to watch Videos. Plus It's free. Five Stars, now get the app.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game,classic and fun with friends brings back memories from when I was a kid and into adult would recommend this for all ages.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I love kakuro, but until this app, I haven't been able to find a decent one for a tablet.  The puzzles are challenging without driving you crazy and the interface is well made.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book. Half way through I couldn't put it down. However I wasn't a big fan of the end. Probably just because it's not how I wanted it to end.
B00004YRQA|5.0|PlayStation 2 Memory Card (8MB) When I get a round to use it I hope it will hold a lot of games.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is an awesome texting app that's not confusing and it's really good and sends messages really fast and easily I like how you can block people that annoy you. Add me I'm an awesome girl to talk to Kerry3121:-)
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book is a great fictional book.  It made me wish sone of its contents could be possible and the characters are amazing.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I bought the movie very good and bought all 10 copies of it to give to the State Police here.
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|This dock outputs digital audio where the YBA-10  Bluetooth & YDS-12 Apple Product dock only output Analog audio.  This dock doesn't require a special connection to your receiver or other audio equipment.  It only requires digital (coaxial) RCA connection along with 5 volts through a USB connection.  A USB charging cube is excellent power source for the YBA-11.
B005ZUR724|4.0|I have a character on TC server but today on the 4 I went online and the server was shut down.  The reason why ..... SYNCERS!!!  Ok my friends were on that server my level 62 my mounts everything it is lost.  I have something to say something to gameloft if you keep the game like this and dont do nothing people will have less rates of the game like this.  So if you do fix it I will give a 5 star rating if you guys fix it oh one last thing I helped alot of people and I am a popular person in the tear coast server I helped my friends and people who are not. But plz fix the game<br /><br />It will say server is busy are you fixing it gameloft ?
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|These guys have awesome customer service and I recieved the product I ordered in great condition. Thanks so much. This is such a great movie. If you don't get it read the plot and watch it a couple times. The second time I saw it I enjoyed it much more. Beautiful visual effects as well.
B008Y76VW2|3.0|Some of the scenes come off as a bit forced, but the film definitely has its heart in the right place.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|New to the Avengers so I started with Captain American.  It was good.  Ending was good and left me wanting to know what happened to the others in the movie...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this app is awsome the only thing is that i cant figure out how to sell one of my horses if i can
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|Love the graphics.  Gameplay is superb, just like the original Lemmings.  I love that you can pause the game and scour the area and plan your moves.  I would recommend this game to anyone who loved there original Lemmings.
B004C6QCT6|5.0|Much as I personally dislike admitting to this, Santana is one of those bands (and they are a band in shape and spirit) that I joined all too many people in taking for granted. Basically Carlos Santana is a musicians musicians-one who surrounds himself with like minded instrumentalists,singers and composers. Luckily Carlos and many of these other talented individuals in his musical sphere are more than capable of compositions that are very commercially viable as well. At the same time Santana are not really in the musical framework to be quote on quote \\"sell outs\\". After a fruitfully funky but commercial dry late 70's Santana regrouped with some new musicians-keeping on the talented Alex Ligertwood and bringing in keyboardist Richard Baker and drummer Graham Lear from Gino Vannelli's band. In both the creative and commercial sense,the whole change totally paid off.<br /><br />  \\"Changes\\",a Cat Stevens interpretation opens the album-done up in a spirited hybrid of folk-rock with Santana's trademark latin percussion. \\"E Papa Re\\" revisits the well balanced funk/rock hybrid of the bands late 70's albums wonderfully. \\"Primera Invasion\\",\\"American Gypsy\\",\\"Brightest Star\\" and the instrumentally amazing \\"Hannibal\\"-with its adrenalin fueled call and response solos bring out a more slickly produced variation of the classic Santana sound of their first trio of albums. \\"Over And Over\\" is a superbly catchy blend of hard arena rock again held up by the solid bedrock of the bands noted percussion section. Russ Ballards \\"Winning\\",of course was the big hit here-done several years earlier by Nona Hendryx but here with more of a rock n soul production sleekness that went right along with the Hall & Oates/Michael McDonald atmosphere of the time.<br /><br />  \\"Tales Of Kilimanjaro\\" has a stark,slowly grooving Afro Latin flavor to it and,along with the bluesy funk version of the excellent singer/songwriter J.J. Cale's \\"The Sensitive Kind\\" are towo of my favorites here. Instrumentally a mid tempo contemporary Latin soul/rock version of \\"I Love You Much Too Much\\",which I somehow always associate with Alberta Hunter,is a highlight as far as Carlos's guitar playing is concerned. Released at the beginning of the post disco period when rock was king on radio anyway, Santana put his newest musical offering into that brew with a compromise: they'd get their arena friendly vocals and guitar solos. But they would not abandon their signature percussion or the jazz/funk fusion elements that had characterized their sound from the get go. One might've thought a band popular during the Woodstock era would've been old hat by the early 80's. This album showcase how,at least in Santana's case, their style and sound would remain endearingly timeless.d tempo contemporary Latin soul/rock version of \\"I Love You Much Too Much\\",which I somehow always associate with Alberta Hunter,is a highlight as far as Carlos's guitar playing is concerned.
