B0019O6IWU|5.0|Love Marshall Rosenberg's nonviolent communication skills & classes.  This book really helps in understanding how to communicate gracefully and not confrontational
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Another great movie. They just seem to be getting better and better. Great price. If you like action don't let this one get by you. Worth every penny.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love that it stores a history of previous calculations. Very helpful! It is extremely easy to use and right at your finger tips.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Grandkids loved this. But then so did I. Just a real good movie to watch. Highly recommend this one. You won't be disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|very fun. just wish it didnt cost cash for things. needs mabey free things for trying other games or stuff.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Really liked this one. Action galore in this one. Watched it a few times already. Seems to get better each time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book tells a story about a marriage that goes wrong. It was a little slow in the beginning, but it had a lot of twists and turns along the way. The characters were well developed and gives you a glimpse into a psychotic mind. The ending wasn't what you would expect, but I wouldn't say it was a bad ending. The book was a page turner and keeps you wanting to read more. Overall an enjoyable read and I would recommend this writer.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I really liked this one. Wonderful acting and plot. Ben Kingsly is good in this one as usual. Grea special effects and stunts.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Awesome! need I say more? My dvd set for the fifth season of Castle was everything I hoped it would be.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I bought the pro version as I am using this as my main alarm clock. I love being able to set up multiple versions of alarms that cover situations I need. I have work week with one work from home day, one for the work from home day, one for Saturday morning personal trainer session, work week with a Monday holiday, and other on one of items as needed. You can set it up to run all night, as long as you plug it in. I've forgotten to plug in and have woken to a dead battery and no alarm.<br /><br />Two tweaks I would like to see:<br /><br />The snooze/stop buttons are small and too close together. Between my big fingers and blurry eyes I have trouble consistently hitting the right one.<br /><br />The screen lets you dim the display by simply sliding your finger up or down. That is very nice, great feature. My complaint is that the screen's ambient light ends up brighter than the numbers. It would be better if the background went dark and the numbers stayed better lit. It also means that on the lowest setting it's hard to see the numbers unless it's very dark, but the screen still provides too much light, like a night light next to your bed. It could be a Kindle limitation - not sure.<br /><br />You can select your own music but the selection screen is just a list of tracks by file name. That could be a Kindle limitation too.<br /><br />A few &#34;User Error&#34; things to look out for:<br /><br />The need to plug it in mentioned above.<br /><br />The sound is based on the last volume used on the Kindle. I once had muted it playing a noisy game, thus no alarm in the morning. You can also get loudly awakened too.<br /><br />Don't forget to bring it to bed when you retire. The kindle is not a purpose made bedside clock, so you have to remember to both set it up at night and grab it in the morning.<br /><br />Overall I really like the product. If the screen brightness issue and snooze button changes were made it would be a solid five.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Oh yes it went over very well. Now I have to get season three.  This is a great gift idea for anyone
B0082RX7EE|5.0|Great introduction of all the characters.  Loved the texted dialogue between the two key characters.  Fun to read and very sexy.
0307266303|5.0|This book will make you want to change various aspects of your life, but remember just because it's in the book it doesn't mean it's right for every individual. One of the best running books I've ever read - and it makes a great gift for both males and females!
0345803493|5.0|I HAD to start reading this immediately after I finished Book One.  I was completely obsessed with the characters and their lives!
B00008FKDJ|1.0|this copy is in EvnyPak rather than in factory sealed——is it new or second hand，sold by amazon LLC——and even worse is the huge crack on the spine of sleeve
0345803507|5.0|I found this final book a good ending to the trilogy.  It had even more suspense than the other two and just as much sensual passages.
B00A9X7X6C|1.0|I love Bruce Willis. I love him to the point of making excuses for him. NOT. THIS. TIME.<br /><br />Rented this movie. Spent about 15 minutes trying to figure it out & arguing with my hubby. Kind of reconciled with the concept, but then it was just so stupid, I gave up after an hour of actual film time. It is so ridiculous, that I realized that the \\"Labyrinth\\" movie with David Bowie is more realistic.<br /><br />Hated it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|If the series continues to get better from book to book the sky is the limit for Child and Reacher!!!!!
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|This CD is like the &#34;B &#34; sides of the Lost Sirens album but nevertheless are great songs in line with the rest of the album. Do not expect remixes or club hits but has a nice rhytm and a must for every New Order fan out there...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another good novel from Grisham, well written and keeps your attention and involved in the story. He always finds a new twist on the legal profession.
B007QUUJMG|3.0|This is a coming of age story centred around Charlie as he enters high school. The story is told in diary format from Charlie's perspective and works well for the premise.  Charlie does not make friends easily but at the start of his freshman year he befriends two older students who draw him into their social circle. The story flows quickly and remains interesting throughout but the reader quickly becomes aware that something is amiss based on some of Charlie's strange actions or reactions. While the reason is only revealed at the end of the book, it is  not difficult to determine what it is way before then. The naivety of Charlie is sometimes unbelievable but still he becomes a likeable character and someone you find yourself rooting for. Overall the story is a heart-warming, sweet tale of friendship and finding yourself.
048629823X|4.0|Very easy to read, full of very interesting thoughts and ideas; Surprising how it still applies to today’s time and current events
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Amy disappears on the morning of her fifth wedding anniversary and her husband Nick is soon the only suspect. Told from the viewpoint of both Amy and Nick in alternating chapters, the story unfolds as two very different perspectives of the same tale. Of course the reader suspects what is revealed about mid way through the book. My initial reaction when the revelation was made was disappointment as I thought the story would taper off from there. However, instead of losing steam the story kicks into high gear and keeps the reader engrossed.<br /><br />My only complaint is the ending. I felt the ending was slightly contrived and not at all in keeping with the characters. Throughout the mystery, the characters remain true to their personality and then all of a sudden at the end of the book the story is neatly wrapped up in a few chapters with completely uncharacteristic behaviour from all parties.<br /><br />Mystery novels can be predictable, but in Gone Girl the author succeeds in putting a refreshing spin on the case of a missing woman. Its well worth the read but be prepared for an anti-climatic ending.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|An aviation flick that goes into the dark side of alcohol and drug addiction.  Part of the story line is taken from a post-accident aircraft crash where maintenance issues of a worn elevator jack screw were discovered by the NTSB in a real airliner crash in US history.  A gripping story of a pilot who was able to land a disabled airliner by using his years of experience to do what was necessary to deal with an impossible situation.  By thinking out side of the box of what is considered normal operation of a passenger airliner.  This story will have you on the edge of your seat right at the beginning of the story, and during the flight emergency.  The rest of the story deals with addiction denial, a cover up, a struggle with truth, and an ending that is revealing of the crux of the human condition.  Anyone who has ever been or is a pilot will empathize with the struggle that Denzel Washington's character goes through.  An ATP Captain who is in a personal struggle with addiction, while attempting to reveal the truth of a horrific crash and trying to preserve his integrity as a pilot.<br /><br />If you are an aviation buff, this is a must see film.
B00999DFP0|5.0|Awesome! Loved being able to get the first 5 seasons intead of having purchase them seperately.  They arrived quickly and promptly.
B00AQTY3XA|3.0|\\"The ones who push the limits discover the limits sometimes push back.\\" While watching waves with his friend a young Jay Moriarty (Weston) watches Frosty (Butler) surfing the biggest waves he has ever seen. He wants nothing more then to eventually surf the \\"Mavericks.\\" After bugging Frosty enough he agrees to train him. This is the true story of the boy who wanted to surf. After the movie Soul Surfer the bar for surfing movies has been raised. That movie dealt with more then just the surfing aspect, it also made you feel for the characters and really pulled for all involved. This movie was good but I didn't feel the emotional connection the the characters like I did in that movie. I'm not saying that this movie isn't good but I didn't feel as invested in this one as I did in Soul Surfer. It is still better then some other surfing movies I have seen but when you watch this curb your expectations. Surfing is really good in this though. Overall, not as good as Soul Surfer, needed more feeling for characters. I give it a B.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This album just gives and gives. I listen to it almost compulsively. The style and execution is quirky, but in ways that come together into exceptionally interesting music.
B00ALCBU4M|3.0|\\"You have to carry out this mission your country is counting on you.\\" Toward the end of WWII the Americans thought the war was over and started to relax. When a group is sent out to deliver food to the needy they are ambushed and discover a horrifying secret. Hitler has a super bomb and isn't afraid to use it. When they hear the scientist in charge of the bomb is looking to defect the squad risks everything and ventures deeper behind enemy lines to find him and get him out. I will start by saying that the movie isn't that bad but it is a low budget war movie. Action is not bad and it is entertaining and an interesting story but it almost had the feel of a PBS type war movie in terms of feel and look. It's not quite as good as the recent batch of war movies that have come out but it's also not terrible and fans of this genre will not be totally disappointed. Overall, not bad but nothing amazing either. I give it a C+.
B0067FGYGQ|4.0|From the reviews and associations I'd expected something with a little more depth and texture. While she belongs in the same conversation as Cat Power and Sarah Vaughn, she doesn't always reach the heights of their achievement--still, a pretty good album.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very good book for individuals needing validation from a credible doctor before entertaining a paleo type diet. If you don't need the information he brings to the table your friends do.
1878424777|2.0|Basic content had value, but being self-assured and not insecure, would have one already practicing what was 'preached.' Lacked depth
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is the perfect distraction for annoying children, to delayed flights. Highly recommended for impatient ppl. And the best part I'd like is that's it's free, so how can u beat that.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The show lives up to all its awards. It's hard to only watch one episode. You always want to know what will happen next. Is he??? Isn't he???
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I guess its good I mean the glitches the crashes and even the game is what makes it suck.<br />if I jump for the silliness ill miss no matter what I do
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Totally hooked! Interesting to see how some folks live. Two stories intertwine so easily. The servants have their own drama along side the family who lives in Downton Abbey.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this series last year. I have literally read it 4 times. Mrs. Collins, you have done a rare thing. You have written a trilogy that improves on each installment. Thank you!!!!!
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Funny and easy to read. Really enjoyed. Some parts were just hilarious. I would read it again just for laughs. She is really a funny writer
B006YTTVHO|1.0|Ok. I thought this was a GOOD book for me because I am the new kid....but I'm fine without this book. It was only holding me back from getting friends. After I ditched this book I got 3 more friends and a boyfriend NOT using your advice. NEVER READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT NO FRIENDS!!!
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|I saw the name of the movie, and I watched it because I thought it would shed some light about life after death, but it didn't. The fact is nobody knows what happens when we die 'cause you can't come back to tell people about the experience. Don't waste your time and money. Look for something else. One more thing, they should've changed the name of the movie because it's very misleading.
B000002P2W|5.0|I never get tire of hear this album, the sound of their music is energetic, fresh and hard, as only THE WHO can do.I hope that they return to the studio to bring us hope that mankind will survive in hapines and joy just by listen to rock and roll music.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I have always enjoyed musicals, this is no exception.  It is a great classic musical anyone would enjoy.  The actors in it are great and the drama and music is wonderful.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|Ho hum. Just didnt do it for me. Nothing new or adventurous. It looked fine on K Fire HD but that's all I can say for it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great app. I love it! You should get this app because it is challenging but fun. Also, it is more advanced than the original Temple Run, so it's more fun to play.
B004T32SOK|5.0|This is easy to set up and easy to use. I installed it on my laptop and my Kindle with no problem. I don;t use it often since I have a few other cloud apps, but it's a good overflow to share projects with other users. In case you don't get it, this is like Dropbox. It's a portal to Cloud-based storage. You put it on your laptop, desktop, Kindle, tablet or whatever and move documents, images, or music through the app to a storage site in the Cloud. It's free, substantial storage, and secure. I use any of them that will give me a few gig of space and assign each portal to a certain type of files. I use this one for images, DropBox for work files, Amazon for music, etc. Never store anything on my hard drive anymore, even my backups are on external drives.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is soo much fun in survival at night there is creepers who explode skeletons that shot arrows spiders and zombies you can collect diamonds and make stuff with a crafting table and in order to get peach diamond you have to make a iron pickaxe you can get iron ore that has peach colored stuff in the middle put that in a furnace and put coal you will get iron make a iron pickaxe and get the diamond
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Personally, I think this is Jane Austen's best work. It's certainly her most mature. Anne Elliott is born into a prideful aristocratic family. At a young age, she nearly marries the love of her life, only to break it off after being persuaded by a mother-like figure (on grounds of his not being able to support her properly). He tries to drown his sorrow in his career in the Navy while she stays quietly at home and suffers the Cinderella-like treatment she receives at home.<br /><br />Circumstances throw them back together again 7-1/2 (I believe) years later; Captain Wentworth did well in the war and is now the object of all the young ladies. Watching them re-unite and deal with the hurt of the past is well worth the read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love dragonvale it is the best game ever plus the dragon are really cute. I play this all the time.
159420411X|2.0|There were many things to like in this book. The author did well in some areas but went off course in others. I particularly was disappointed in his handling of Global Warming. While in the book he kept stressing the need to detect the signal from the noise, in this chapter he seemed to ignore his own teachings. He consistently tried to support the global warming advocates even when he showed their predictions were not supported by their own data. He only interviewed the advocates and not the detractors.<br /><br />While I recommend reading the book, be a skeptic and try not to be swayed by the authors own bias.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Every Christmas I try to buy a season to a new show to introduce my younger cousin to.  She is in high school now, and I want her to know the great shows I grew up with as well.  Dawson's Creek is definitely one of them!  I recommend this series to anyone who grew up in the 90's or even in high school now.  The complete series is a great deal and then you get the whole story!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put it down.<br />This was A book club pick.  Left you wishing for more chapters and wanting to talk with the characters.
B00846F1YW|3.0|This is the first game like this type that I 'be ever played.  Overall it is entertaining and difficult on a couple levels. in
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I save everything on Evernote, I mean pictures, magazine clips, recipes, thoughts, you name it. The best part is I can access it on my kindle, phone, and computer.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|This album does take one back to an easy going time but is classically relevant to everyone! Poetry of a generation.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it was the best game I ever played but it sucked but it was good but now that I think about it it sucked
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I think this is a must read. Foe fans of Anthony, red hot chili peppers, addict, or people who like real life story's.
0525478817|5.0|There is no way that I can even attempt to write a reasonably cohesive review for this book.  As Augustus said, \\"My thought are stars I can't Fathom into constellations.\\" So I leave you with some random thoughts:<br /><br />1. This book transcends targeted reading audiences in both \\"reading level\\" and \\"genre\\".  In other words, whatever you like to read, whether you like to read, if you haven't read this book...go read it.<br />2. This is not a book about cancer, death, or love...this is a book about life.  And for better or worse cancer, death and love are inextricable pieces thereof.<br />3. You will cry though out this book, so make sure you have tissues handy.<br />4. Ironically though, most of the time, you will be smiling through the tears.<br />5. If you are human, as I presume you all are, this book will make you view the universe differently...or rather view how you view the universe differently, or how you wish the universe would view you, or even just what exactly the universe is...<br />6. At my ripe old age of 38, I have yet to ever re-read a book (not counting picture books read to children)...this is the first book going on my newly created \\"To be re-read\\" list.<br /><br />Source: This book was a gift from a book club friend
B005K0HDGE|5.0|You can never figure out how convoluted he can make a story. Love King, kept me interested but not maniacal so that I could put the story down at night.
B0063IH60K|5.0|excellent time filler. comes handy everytime. I have this on all my mobile devices. love it. thank you mobilityware. keep them coming.
0470901071|5.0|This book would definitely make you pass the CCNA Routing and Switching exam. The review chapters at the end of the chapters are a good guide  to test how well you understood what you have just Read. It gave me encouragement to study CCNP Routing and Switching. Its worth the money. No regrets at all.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|Joni is my hero and this collection did not disappoint. The quality is also excellent and to have the implication all together, has been a godsend
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very good and never gets boring always something new to find out which challenge you to play more.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|kids played with it and so did i it makes you think to figure out how to get three stars. be careful not to slide off the table
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I love that Andrew Stanton and Disney made the investment to bring Barsoom to the big screen. It breaks my heart that the advertising left people scratching their heads. Bring on &#34;the gods of mars&#34; movie!
B009G8GRX6|4.0|The 2nd Law is Muse's most recent album, and is definitely one of my favorites. It doesn't quite compare to The Resistance, but some songs are real hits! My personal favorite is the song Survival. I recommend this album for any Muse lovers out there.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|The kids play for hours. Need I say more? This toy is a fantastic investment. I like playing with them too...
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Fuctions better than expected and it looks great too.  Highly recommended.  Great product great price! Doesn't get better than that!
B0085LMFAE|5.0|What else needs to be said? Paul Simon's classic album needs no review here except to say that they have done an excellant job and it sounds as good today as  it did when it first appeared.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have been searching for another great writer and I have found one. Watch out Stephen King...I have found my new favorite!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Combining a contemporary-rock sound with nostalgic and subtly erotic lyrics (sometimes explicit) this album delivers up strongly emotive music that betrays a strong sense of longing and adventure. Del Ray's voice is both haunting and beautiful, and displays a remarkable dynamic ability seldom found in today's popular music. Leveraging none of today's pop shallowness, this album is playful but reflective and serious. Highly recommend.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Good movie , not sure why people give it bad reviews, better than Quantom of Solace. And enjoy a movie because you like it not because of reviews. I like a lot of movies most would hate. But for a Bond flick its not bad. As I recall Bond movies were kind of cheesy even in the 60s.
0765325950|1.0|Considering the digital age that we now live in and the availability of ebook formats, it is extremely sad that some publishers would still support the antiquated notion of not releasing in electronic format. I have  enjoyed this series for many years and I will now have to wait for the kindle format release.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am not a person who likes to read, but after the first page I was hooked. The author makes you feel as if Charlie is talking directly to you. You're able too connect with Charlie and relate to him. At times I would check my mail box looking for letters from a boy like Charlie. This book makes me look at my self and see if I'm completely honest and happy. This book deserves more than five stars.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I could not put this game down. Worked great on my kindle fire. I can't wait until the next one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was so good! I can not wait for the movie to come out.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I am a big jigsaw puzzle person.  I have been putting them together on my computer for years.  Now finally a great app for my Kindle Fire.  I was so surprised to find that even at the master level the whole puzzle still fits on my screen instead of scrolling to fit it all on. Good job guys.  The puzzles were beautiful, it would be nice for the lines to disappear once the piece fits. I turned off the music but the extra scrape before the puzzle clicks I could do without.  Sometimes the movement on my KF is sluggish but I can work around that.  Some of the winter pictures on the KF almost made me \\"snowblind\\" by the end.  Sometimes it saved my puzzle and I could continue it but a couple times I had went on to something else and it wasn't saved.  That-app makers-is a flaw.  No one wants to work hard at a puzzle only to find because life interupted them that they have to start the puzzle over.  GRRRR..please lets have a save button.  I have also found a med grey background does better for puzzle viewing. I wish I could have been a beta tester on this.  OK now lets have more puzzles..I'm ready.  I got this as a free app but I would pay for this app I enjoy it so much.<br /><br />NOTE:  Puzzle pieces are NEVER \\"missing\\"  they may be behind or drop off but you can always get them to reappear.  Click on the puzzle piece in the lineup.  or grab your puzzle and move it all around to see under it.  All the pieces are there you just have to know how to get them.  Don't give up on this app it's GREAT!
B00ATPVA78|5.0|interesting story and game play holding my interest and that aint easy but don't like minimum on this opinion frame.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great reading! Very detailed look at the characters and the country. So much better to have read about it before seeing the movie. My husband, who said it was a 'girlie' book watched the movie and seemed lost.<br /><br />I have yet to read the other two books, but I look forward to them.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderfully written!! And not painfully sad. I was left wanting more. I definitely recommend this to read. Another epic love story.
B0063M22QO|4.0|HAving fun on this space and good colors and new tiles.  Like it also that it has the three levels.
B00AZM7IQC|3.0|I liked it ok, but the video wasn't long enough.  I figured it would be at hour or so, but it was far less.  Cost per minute was probably more than a full-length movie.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time from begining to end.<br />a must see for all the John Wayne fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have read in a while. It shows what we are all capable of to survive.  It also shows how we go along with what authorities demand of us, even if they are wrong. I also learned that having nothing is not always a bad think. Everyone should read this book.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I really want to say 3 1/2 stars but can't make it work from my Kindle. The story was good with some interesting characters. I was a slow read. Did not have that \\"can't put it doneness\\" I want from winter reads but had enough to keep me coming back.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I really like the size of the characters as well as fact that the calculator<br />fills the screen.  I have a hand tremor, so the extra space is most appreciated.  My stylus and I are working more easily.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is awesome but dosent let me enter on my kindle fire when I enter the app it like automaticly exits

0439813786|5.0|After watching the movie with my kids I wanted to read them the book. This is a lovely heavy hard back book that could be kept in the family for generations. The story is fantastic and the illustrations are beautiful.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I liked the book very much and appreciated how the author would artfully retell the story in a few sentences so that the reader could keep the three generations of characters in<br />order.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a well made and easy to use app.  Everything at your fingertips, easy to see, easy to use.  Sizing is better than in the browser. I don't know what else to say, it does what it is supposed to do, and does it well.  I have a kindle fire HD.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I downloaded the free version on my kindle, not realizing it was a demo. I couldn't buy the full version fast enough. This game has beautiful graphics and an engaging story line, not to mention fun, challenging hidden object and puzzle games. I can't WAIT for part two!!!

B005LAJ212|5.0|I think Emily VanCamp is a great candidate for the role of Miss MARVEL in the AVENGERS movie, and a live action movie based on FATHOM : KITANI comix
0316227706|5.0|What a beautiful book.  It pays homage to the dedication our pets offer to us.  Looking at the faces of those beautiful creatures fetching a ball in what must be a foreign and unliked environment is amazing.<br />The book arrived from Amazon and I was so happy.  It was cheaper (almost by half) than had I gone out and purchased the book in a retail outlet.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|Game is fun, but recently I won't get notifications when its my turn, which makes it useless. My friend has the game and she has the same problem, so it's not just us.
0345529057|5.0|These books are great, George rr Martin creates a new world and then submerges you in it. With complex story lines across 1000s of miles. Already read the fifth book and can't air for number 6.

B005LAIIA8|5.0|I chose this rating as I am satisfied with the quality &<br />price of this 3D movie; henceforth, to which I do recommend<br />customers to have their &#34;Frankenweenie (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray<br />3D/Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy)&#34;  purchase carried out at<br />Amazon.com.
0307943259|5.0|Purchased this audiobook as the second one for my trip - have arrived but can't wait to get in my car to finish the last 4 CD's.  This has certainly been one of my favorite's from John Grisham - lots of twists and turns and intrigue and not at all what I expected.  Sometimes wondered where story was going and then was really surprised where he took it!  Great read!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love playing games like this, It will be very useful  with my kid he is 6 and gets restless in waiting rooms.but with this game he will have a great distraction.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Very entertaining, Washington is awesome in this movie, did not care for John Goodman, a little stereotypical, but he is easily ignored.  It is good to see a non-hollywood movie.  Truly gripping, excellent crash scenes, makes me want to never fly ever again.  I was gripping the chair it is so realistic and you realize that could really be you............  Story is complex and even if a little predictable, it was worth it.  Great!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't believe all the positive reviews Wool had received so  after finishing it I sat amazed at what a great story and wonderful characters Hugh Howey brought to life.  All the five star reviews are right, this is on  of the best fiction novels I've read in many years.  As I read each of the novellas, I was amazed at how much care had been put in the creation of  the world and the believable characters.  All the characters behave realistically without the cheap cardboard cutout reactions many authors resort to.<br /><br />I couldn't be more excited to recommend Wool to anyone who enjoys a great story.  Read this book, you won't be disappointed.
B0086900TI|5.0|Finally a movie that depicts the true and graphic realities of the teaching profession in the U.S. and an educational system that has sunken into the abyss. Every teacher must watch this movie. Anyone thinking of becoming a teacher must also watch this movie to understand, that making a difference in the lives of students, is now a myth.  Schools have become a microcosm of our dyfunctional society, where parents believe it is the role of teachers to raise their children and with student who only care about their phones, drugs, sex and music. There is no support system for teachers or students.  This movie shows how teachers, who once entered the profession to help students fulfill their dreams, are now broken, depressed and demoralized beings....mirroring a system responsible for their demise.  Educational policy makers, including the President, should watch the \\"true\\" state of education and the destruction of the teaching profession.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a great app, I recommend it to anyone who loves horses. Children might love this app, because it lets you feel like u actually have a horse.
1457514508|3.0|All seems perfect in the Savannah suburb of Gordonston. The mature ladies meet each day in the local park to sip a cocktail and gossip while their dogs get their exercise. Their neighbours include a new widower, an attractive young couple who appear very much in love, an English house-husband and an elderly black man they don't know but frown upon because he doesn't clean up after his pooch.<br /><br />Where to start with this novella? I have to say it took me a while to get into it, but get into it I eventually did.<br /><br />It's very much a telling of the story and I'm not a fan of that style. The best way I can think of to describe it is that it reminded me of how fairy tales are told, a linear unfolding of happenings. The narration does not include a lot of dialogue. The characters also are sketched in, not finely described.<br /><br />It's an ensemble piece. The many characters have equal billing and the author changes the point of view between them frequently and without warning. There are no, for instance, extra line spaces to herald a new perspective. You may stick with one character for several pages or a paragraph. However, once you realise you're subject to frequent POV changes it ceases to be a problem.<br /><br />Like a fairy tale all seems perfect at the beginning. These many characters are friends or good neighbours who show compassion when tragedy strikes.<br /><br />However, after a while I began to notice a feeling of impeding doom settling on me, a feeling that something awful is about to happen. It does, but it's not what I expected. The author very cleverly builds suspense while seemingly nothing of any moment is happening. From there the world of all these characters begins to disintegrate and we see through the sugar coating into their mean and ugly selves. No-one remains pure and although not everyone receives their comeuppance in the confines of the book it's on the cards they will at some point down the track. Perhaps the author has a sequel in mind.<br /><br />At the end it remained for me a modern fairy tale with wicked characters wanting to harm others without much reason.uel in mind.<br /><br />At the end it remained for me a modern fairy tale with wicked characters wanting to harm others without much reason.
B00A2LOAKI|3.0|Batman has been represented in animation probably more than any other comic figure.  And that, unfortunately, works against Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2.  Let's start with the animation.  Proportionally, it simply doesn't look right.  Batman/Bruce Wayne is drawn as a hulking brute, all the while he's being depicted in his elder years (60+?).  The face is too large, the chest is bloated, it just doesn't look &#34;right&#34;.  Peter Weller does admirable work as the voice of Batman, but for anyone who's watched any of the other incarnations, the cadence and deep tones are just &#34;off&#34;.  All in all, the animation is first rate.  But these are nitpicky things compared to the chasms that are plot holes and mis-characterization.  Batman uses a gun...WTF?  Joker is boiled down to nothing more than a rampaging maniac with a gun, killing without any of the panache that the character is known for.  The GCPD couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat (even my 11 year old son kept commenting that they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn time and time again).  Superman becomes what is essentially one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse (blight) and that plot point is never even discussed.  Oh, and the worlds most infamouse homocidal maniac is booked on a &#34;Dave Letterman-like&#34; TV show without any fear or protection.  Yeah, thats gonna happen.<br /><br />All in all, the story is entertaining enough, Part 1 of this 2 part DVD set really isn't REQUIRED to enjoy part 2 (but it helps understand why Robin is a girl).  But I never felt like I was watching a Batman animated feature that featured the Batman that I've read for 30 years and watched in B:TAS, Justice League, or even Batman: TBTB.  Which is why I can't give this anything more than 3 out of 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game.I play everyday and still can't get enough. Hopefully there will be another update soon. I like the different locations.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it!!!!!<br /><br />I couldn't, put it down best book I have read in as long time. Ok onto the next!

B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is fun for my daughter and I. We play it together and separately.  It is addicting... more than we knew.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I tried to install it to my Kindle Fire, but when i tried to open it it would keep giving me a stupid error message. This is ridiculous I want a refund!!
B0060CX8F6|5.0|My daughter really loves this movie.  It has great quality and it a lovely story.  It is not your average princess story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an extordinary wonderful book. I have read all the books and they led up to a magnificent series of books<br />. Only one issue,.... there isnt another one! Thank you for the wonderful book Suzanne Collins
0062213423|5.0|I bought this book for my niece for Christmas. It's a nice addition to any ID fan. She can't get enough of these boys.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I gave this book  a 4 star because it is funny and very comical.  I didn't like the ending because it doesn't make you want to read the next book.  I would recommend this book anyone that loves comics and/or has read the series of these hilarious books.
0525953728|2.0|Glad I sold it back when it was still worth money.  Would have been better if the book talked about Bin Laden being a CIA asset they they funded until the week before 9/11.  How may times did the news report that Bin Laden was killed?  At least 3; so how truthful this raid was, remains to be seen.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This movie's plot goes all over the place.  If you are incredibly logical, it won't make clear sense at all.  Has good special effects though.  A tad bit of unnecessary violence was present through and through.  It'll be approximately ninety minutes of your life that you will never get back.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|The Bluray dvd combo arrived on time and without any damages. This movie is another great movie by the legendary Clint Eastwood.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|This episode was the worst.  Please quit while you are ahead.  I did like the special effect but that's where it ended.  The story line was uber lame.  Lots of action though.  Too bad Ali Larter wasn't in this one because that would have made all the difference.
B0016K40KY|1.0|The video which you sent to me was designed to work in Region 1 (USA).<br />I have returned the product.<br />Australia is in Region 4, which is why the video did not work.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Good wholesome family movie.  Will get you in touch with your inner child.  Basically Dracula is an over protective dad that doesn't want his baby girl to grow up.  He ends up coming around to reality though.  This is a funny movie for the entire family to enjoy.
0486407217|4.0|I liked this a lot because it is authentic.  But it's going to take some work to translate into a pattern I can use. I'm a size 10 (average, medium), and I'll take some generic patterns I have and draw onto them the style lines for the Victorian styles.  That will be work!  but I'll have some very distinctive gowns, instead of the ones put out by recent pattern companies (I already have several of those made.) It can be done by an advanced sewist.  The patterns could also be realized by draping onto a form using huge chunks of (at first, muslin) fabric in the shape needed, graded up from the drawings in the book.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This is a suspense filled movie about an alcoholic that saves the day and eventually saves himself in the end.  You will probably stop drinking afterwards.  Ok kidding.  It has some funny parts that you have to be quick to catch.  Has a fair share of drug scenes too.  Put the kids to bed for this one.  There's a tiny bit of nudity.  Enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and entertaining for all ages. good app very reliable. love that no wick connection is needed to be able to play, and the skill levels get harder on some
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Or else you might not like this one very much.  I think the original was better but the remake has much better special effects though.  Too bad they didn't use the \\"ju hab vat ju vant, give das people da air\\" scene.  Oh well.  Maybe in the next remake.  The \\"two weeks\\" scene was there but with a slight twist.  See the original first.  Peace.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I LOVE this MJ movie! It's been one of my favorites since I was at least a toddler. Many Thanks. MJ ROCKS!
B005J9ZDYK|4.0|Season 2 is different from season 1.  Shaun the sheep was unique,because the characters didn't do violent things to each other, and weren't insulting...it was an obvious the writers/creators stuck to that format.  In Season 2, they reverted to, well, being like every other Tom and Jerry cartoon.  It's still very good stuff, but a little disappointing for the change.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an amazing story of love and concurring fears. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants a story of unconditional love and the willingness to help work through the demons we all have.

B00AVTMB4I|4.0|We loved the movie , but for HD and never could get in HD because of amazon inability to deliver the stream.  Watched on VUD with no problem of getting HDX experience,  Think VUDU will be my choice for purchasing movies now on.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Can't say this movie was all that riveting or even  worth 2 hours of your life.  I just found the movie a huge disappointment and well wish spent my 5 dollars at Five guys.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have the paid version and love it...in fact I've gotten to the point where I can't live without it. It puts my 2 year old to sleep and keeps him that way like a charm.  It also helps me.  I am a very light sleeper.  I have  another white noise app that lets you mix sounds which is fun but I never use after finding this one. This app has tons of great sounds to choose from and you can use other apps while the sounds are on. Love it!
B004FEL6GO|5.0|My Grand son just loves it... ordered it just before Christmas and got it days before..<br />great toy for boys

B0043ZDU1E|5.0|When a friend's husband said that she would like this CD, I was delighted to buy it for her birthday. I already own it and have enjoyed it very much, as I hope she will.  Some of the traditional songs were familiar to me, some not, but Loreena McKennitt does a great job with all of them.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Very good product. Had it for over a year now and no signs of wear, but used regularly. Good purchase.
B00466HNHM|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, Ive been wanting to buy it for the longest time in best buy and couldnt find it. Till I checked here n found it, the price was also reasonable.

B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. Wonderful storyline and acting from the entire cast. This movie had a lot of twists and turns that I didn't see coming. This is a must see movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Must read for every  American! Spouses of all deployed service members will certainly be able to relate to the trials between deployments that military families experience.
B004FEJ3VY|2.0|This was not what i was expecting at all. The description pictures made it seem like its bigger but its actually only a little taller than a regular size soda can.<br /><br />This was purchased as a gift for someone and he didn't complain about it but i was disappointed I spent $40 on something so small.
B000062V9C|2.0|I had no knowledge of a regional code until I purchased this dvd.  It had a regional code of 2 and we cannot play a 2 on any dvd player here in the US as the regional code should be a 1 or a 3.  Please specify the regional codes when you are selling a dvd.  Thank you!
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I would never thought to put this kind of twist on a classic but I loved it when I saw it so I had to go out and add it to my personal collection.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|I know with technology the way it is today this futuristic twist is behind the times but I loved it as a little girl and I'm a collector of classic movies so this is a keeper.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Bought it to replace an Energizer garage door opener battery. Maxell is and has been a very reputable brand, and the price for 5 batteries was less than the price of just one 'brand name' battery at Walmart. I would absolutely look to this vendor for the purchase of any future batteries.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It is inspiring and optimistic. I can't wait to see this movie, I'm sure it will be just as wonderful.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|I read so many negative reviews about the movie, so much so, that I almost didn't get this movie. Boy I'm glad I did.<br /><br />First off, I don't know what the theatrical version is like, but the extended uncut version is awesome! Honestly it starts off okay. The acting is not so great. The fighting seemed bit rough on the edges. But I still felt the need to see it through. As the story progresses and other more important characters in the story come into play, the movie begins to come to life. I then realized what this movie is suppose to be, FUN & ENTERTAINING!<br /><br />The plot is great. It's fun and very imaginative. I don't know what movie people watched when they gave this movie bad reviews. This nowhere near of being a bad movie at all. It has cult classic written all over. Maybe most critics were expecting a polished generic Hollywood action movie. This is not it folks. It is not comedy either. It is just simply imaginative, fun, and entertaining. But it does take time to mature.<br /><br />I read somewhere that the blacksmith back story ruined the movie, because it was so far fetched. What? This is an awesome back story, it's so original. I mean who would have ever come up with something like that. It's brilliant.<br /><br />I read a lot of criticism about Rza being a horrible actor, not having a face to play a lead role, rappers shouldn't be making movies, he overextends himself... Come on. Instead of focus on the fact that a rapper wrote, directed, composed, and starred in the movie focus on the movie. His acting fits perfectly with his character. The musical score was awesome. The directing wasn't that bad. The plot as I said was fun and imaginative.<br /><br />This movie started out as a 3 but slowly became a solid 4.5. I appreciate the creativity of the movie and its characters. There are little details here and there that I'm sure on my second viewing it will become a solid 5. I think it's fresh and much needed in Hollywood today. This is not a Quentin Tarantino, it's not Kill Bill, so stop trying to find comparison.<br /><br />I believe credit should be given where it is due, that's what compelled me to write this review.
B009NPA3MS|4.0|I love his soulful voice.  Can't wait for his next album.  Would be nice to see him perform live, maybe he will be on tour

B00005O3VC|5.0|I've not seen this in awhile, but it is pure Monty Python if you don't know English(Brit) rumor, this is 101 to PHD
B007FEFLTO|5.0|WWII was a tragedy that  brought the worst and best out everyone living during that time. All the characters in the book are so real and tangible. It's scary how though this occurred in the 1930's our world has not really changed much and the same political beliefs still circulate though it is obvious Fascist/Communistic ideology is a lie promising a good life for all and giving us only a brutal form of slavery. I laughed and cried and rooted for those who were tortured just because they were born Jews or maimed. Most of them are gone, but a smattering of their stories live in books like this.<br /><br />A must read for anyone who like historical fiction and wants to understand the nuances of the different views held at that time.
1401923127|5.0|This is a wonderful, easy to read book that clarifies exactly how energy healing works.  I couldn't put it down.  It's not another &#34;airy fairy&#34; book about &#34;going with your intuition;&#34; but, rather, a scientific treatise on the physiological mechanisms by which the body is influenced by the mind.  Thanks, Dr. Lipton.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I was lucky enough to attend \\"Endfest\\" in Seattle, Dec 2012 and M83 was one of many artist to perform.  They were heads and tails above everyone on the list when it came to sound quality.  I was only familiar with a couple of their songs, but instantly feel in love with their talents.  I ordered their latest two CD's off Amazon and have been playing them ever since.  It's been a LOOONG time since music like this has shown up -- maybe not since Engima.  I only wish M83 would come out with a music DVD similar to Enigma's -- crazy good visuals to go along with amazing music.  Well done M83!
B00APUQT7I|2.0|It played smoothly and i rent it at a good price. The problem? I live in a bilingual home, and we try to teach our children good Spanish, you know, for their own future, but the video does no give language option nor subtitle opcion. Big bummer, netflix let you change the movie language in many of their films.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a cool game.If it world tour it's much cooler.So I hope you play Subway surfers.It really cool.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book, really gives some insight into the lives and sacrifices these warrior's and their families make for our country. Hat's off to them all and God bless them.

0449227421|4.0|I always look forward to a Ken Follett book.  This one has a fantastic opening, as we careen from a young professor, to a vicious rape, to mistaken identities, to the halls of power in government and academia. Mistaken identity and lost twins are the best friends of the storyteller and the magician, since the early days of the English language and even earlier with the Romans. Follett tries to put a new spin on the twins caper by introducing even more twins and intertwining the discovery with dangerous Nixon-era creeps.<br /><br />The young professor falls in love with one twin who is a outstanding young law student, eventually becoming her protector and lover. Meanwhile the other twins are out raping and pillaging.  It seems that all these efforts at genetic engineering never quite work out for some reason.  When Follett wrote this in 1996 the concept of cloning was new, limited to sheep.  Now this topic has become common place and maybe even implemented, depending on how much of what TMZ reports you believe.  This is a fun book even though Follett throws in all the standard stereotypes including the ancient WWII veteran looking for one last adventure, the presidential candidate with the dark past, army officers who shoot first, ask questions later, and cops who are insensitive and stupid.<br /><br />This is nowhere near as good as Follett's best such as The Key to Rebecca or The Eye of the Needle but still better than most.
B008Y6WPXC|2.0|This was a very bad story with acting to match. The movie was filmed in the dark so most of the time you only saw action in flashes. Directors seem to think filming in the dark makes the movie more suspenseful but I find it makes me wonder why I paid for HD.<br />Stallone should get out of these always the same scenes where he has the stuffing beat out of him and then miraculously wins in the last seconds. Jason Statham was good but was not convincing as Stallone's sidekick.He seemed more intelligent than that.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Two of us really enjoy Mahjong, so we have had a lot of fun with this free app. so far.
B007SGLZH6|5.0|It requires you have done a little bit of baking before, but it really nails down what is at the core of baking great bread. Great read.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Loved this movie ,which is actually a documentary about a lost musical icon. It slowly grows on you and leaves you joyful and in awe at the spiritual dignity and power of one little known (to America) artist  and his music. The spiritual dignity of this movie will haunt and grace  your thinking for weeks if not longer. A must see.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've been listening to radio online for more than 10 years, on desktops and laptops.  Now that I have a Kindle Fire, I'm using Tunein Radio Pro - it so rocks!  It has everything I could want, apparently.  When I was visiting my family in California I enjoyed station KCEA, which is a local high school-operated station with a high-quality broadcast, playing Big Band era music - 30s-50s, with virtually no interruptions and no noticeable repetition.  Its broadcast range is only about 15 or 20 miles, but there it is on Tunein!<br /><br />If it supplies stations like this, it will probably provide most people with stations they're looking for.  And for 99c, isn't it worth a try?
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Fun and interesting characters.  High Quality Acting. Bizarre and &#34;oh so wonderful&#34; themes. Twists upon twist, yet continuity of (interesting) storyline throughout!  A winner of a show!
0553386794|5.0|The bar was set high as I embarked on reading A Game of Thrones. The HBO series is absolutely fantastic, the best show on television, in my humble opinion. However high my expectations were, the novel far exceeded them for one simple reason - George R.R. Martin is an absolutely sensational writer. As a fellow author, I can appreciate the skill and flawless technique that Martin displays. His description of scenes and the intricate details that he adds makes the novel come to life in a way that few writers I have ever read are capable of pulling off. Simply put, Martin is a master of prose. His characters are incredibly well-drawn, the suspense and tension are gripping, his command of the language is without peer.<br /><br />I was amazed at how closely the HBO series followed the novel, even to the point where they used much of the same dialogue. It's little wonder that the show is so good - the source material is of the highest quality. Martin eclipses the vast majority of the fantasy writers that I have read. A Game of Thrones is one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read. If you haven't done so already, you need to read this book.<br /><br />Carl Alves - author of Blood Street
B008VJYWMY|4.0|This has some great selections on it, but I find I have to adjust the sound from track to track--the loud parts are really loud and the soft parts almost disappear.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Fringe takes the viewer into an amazing world where the \\"fringe\\" of science happens everyday. No science fiction fan will be disappointed in this show. Watch it now. You will love it.
0316069434|5.0|I have read every book Michael Connelly has written and they never cease to please me.  He is such a great storyteller.  He just gets better and better.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Little slow to start and the ending was a little uninspired,but good. Would recommend. Use five more words to finish!
030746363X|1.0|This all sounds good, but not worth the money...next time Ill wait until it gets to half price used books
B008AWBQGW|5.0|I purchased this CD for my own listening pleasure and it has given me many hours of personal musical enjoyment. Almost like being at their last concert!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Each time I listen to the songs I get something better and better out of them.  The riffs on guitar and in voice are amazing. Beautiful lyrics and music.... Great combination of 2 wonderful artists.
B00979CS50|5.0|I purchased this CD for my husbands' listening pleasure and it has given him many hours of personal musical enjoyment.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|An easy book to pick up and put down...almost Young Adult fantasy. Don't come here for anything serious about Celtic mythology.
B003BVK36Q|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for a reader who loves suspense/thrillers.  He said he found the book well written and a good find.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I read other reviews and discovered this was the preferred recording of several reviewers.  I can see why.  I have really enjoyed it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A great idea woven into a very entertaining story.  Just enough steaminess and believability.  Can't wait to read some more of her work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I read all the reviews before getting a game and I loved the reviews so I got the game and I love horses
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Good twists and turns.  Reads at an entertaining pace.  Great escape reading.  Colleen Hoover has now been added as one of my &#34;go to&#34; authors.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Like with too many other game apps, this version pales in comparison to more sophisticated versions... good brief distraction,  though.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was helplessly captivated by the story of Hopeless. I read it constantly til the end. I could not put this down.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a highly addictive and fun game.  Though you do tend to get better as you go along, this is a great attention-building exercise.
B002QCD2QO|1.0|The only thing good about this movie, was the opportunity it gave me to laugh myself sick.  I walked around for a week smacking myself on the rear and slapping walls wherever I went.  The music was enough to make me impale myself to get away. It is shocking anyone would give this movie anything but one star.  Am I in the twilight zone?  Has the whole world gone mad? Are all the people giving this five stars related to the cast or director?  If this is a winner, I recommend FrankenFish for the academy award.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Certainly one of the most entertaining as well as thoughtful and heartwarming series. Seems like a simple premise (ala UpTheDownStaircase) but it works.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator &amp; I looked a several free ones before using this one. I use it every time I balance my checkbook.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|i got TR2 a while ago and i played it and loved it. now however it wont let me play it. i tried to reinstall it but couldnt because now ot only says &quot;open&quot; and not install. on kindle fire. HALP ME PLZZZZZ!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a really good app I love it so far!! :) It works pretty fine on the kindle fire and its great for little kids!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game allows a bunch of different options to interact with your pet horse. From mixing feed to grooming to mucking out stalls and training for competitions this game has it all
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It is hard for me to review this produce as I have not played it enough. I'm not a very good artist, so I wonder if this would be a good game for me.  I'll try to play it more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this app!!! Its so realistic and it actually teaches you the basics of taking care of a horse. Its better than not having a horse at all.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I loved that this was written from Alice's point of view.  It also answered many questions about this awful disease.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I am always on a desperate hunt to try to find the next good read.  I felt it had a good story line to keep me attuned.  I actually read it in less than 48 hours.  As I think back, I like the &#34;A-ha&#34; moment it gave me.  Good story.
B00821OX98|4.0|This has a decent storyline and plot development. Though most of the characters are static, some do grow into an anchor for the show and its life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game! My high score is 609, 086! Its awsome i love it. Recommended for any age. &lt;3
B009GED3HS|5.0|I have seen every episode of this show & season 8 is turning out to be the best season yet! I am SOOO excited for season 9!!!!
B005HEVBGG|4.0|I enjoyed the series again, been quite a few years and there were some good episodes that brought back the memories.
B005F3XV62|5.0|sometimes movies are enjoyable just to watch. This is one of those..........decent storyline with a love story woven into it and is one of those that is just fun to watch. I have viewed it several times and is great to watch as a family.
B002DD67XG|5.0|The best cleaning the house on Saturday morning chill out lp of all time. You can not be in a bad mood listening to this!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I am one of those who enjoy movies to be entertained mosttimes, not to be a severe movie critic. If the action is good, a decent storyline, and the actors reasonably believeable, then to me it is a good movie. I don't think EVERY movie has to make some sort of political or cultural statement. This movie delivers.  Has good action with seamless movement throughout. It was a good movie to just put on the DVD and enjoy. I would definitely recomment this movie to other action movie buffs. The original copy I bought was defective, but the seller was excellent and gave an instant credit, so I had to get a copy elsewhere. If you like action you will enjoy this movie.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The story line was very original. It had something for everybody; passion for doing something that you love to do, sports (fishing that is), a love story, politics and  humor...lots of it. The acting was excellent and the scenery was wonderful.  I have now seen it twice and enjoyed it as much the second time around as I did the first time.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I had high hopes for this movie but it didn't quite make the grade with me. The action was decent but far fetched. The storyline finally took an unplausible turn that I found hard to fathom and believe. It was ok and would bear watching once or even twice, but is not one those that you would pull out every now and then to watch again. But hey, each to his own.
086571701X|5.0|Very well written (some minor spelling errors), the lecture is quite pleasant, very good knowledge source from the author, strongly motivational, had to import it to my country but it was worth the hassle.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan no doubt. This is an excellent movie with numerous twists and turns but is very enjoyable. If you love Star Trek you will like this.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|This item arrived on time and was just as described.  The DVD plays perfectly and was a fantastic value and a great movie.
B003SHYVO8|4.0|These Step Up movies are so ridiculous and so much fun.  I think the dancing is fantastic and the &#34;un-realness&#34; of it is just a crack up.  These random folks put together a &#34;spontaneous&#34; dance in two days complete with elaborate costumes, immaculate timing and outstanding choreography.  Getting just one of these routines right would take longer that the whole time period of the movie.  Still,that's part of the entertainment and I love the dancing.
0767817478|5.0|Bought this to build up my DVD collection from VHS, seller was fast, orderly and DVD was still in plastic wrapping, no dings, no scratches, no skips.
B009VB97EY|3.0|The professional dancers who played the male strippers were great.  Their acts were very impressive and entertaining.  The rest of this movie is entirely forgettable.
B000069HSP|5.0|Very fast, in original plastic, overall we are pleased with recieving this DVD. It makes my skin tingle when I watch it, if you know<br />any of your military history and you like Mel Gibson you are going to love this movie.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are way to old for this nonsense and look it.  Emma Thompson was terrible.  Must be her worst movie ever.  The plot was sort of interesting.  Josh Brolin's imitations of Jones' mannerisms was amusing.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|This is the first book of the series and I liked it though there was a little bit of language I could have done without.  But not too bad, overall.  I will want to read others in the series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is worth getting if you just want to relax play all day or play all night pretty good to have
B0020M99LC|5.0|If you like the classic Bond stories, that have story and don't need the 20 minute chase scenes every 5 minutes to keep you in your seat, you will love this one. There were complaints about the long poker scenes, but those are what give a story character. This movie has tons of character. Movies that have explosions every 5 minutes are probably trying to cover up weak story lines.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|i know the weather in a lot of places great to have, especially if you travel alot it is worth it
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If you like movies you have to pay attention to, and make you think to keep up, than go with it. Raises many interesting thoughts.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best app I have tried in a long time!!!! It is addictive!!! And you can save your self!!!
B001VIMCW4|4.0|If the stars had a 4 and a half, it would have got that. Not quite the same as Casino Royale, but the perfect companion piece.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a wonderful show.  It is great to see a totally new show with such wonderful acting and writing.  So often on network TV you don't get that combination.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed!! what can I say about this book..This book was amazing! Soooooo many emotions! One minute I'm laughing ,then I'm crying, and angry. This book is a must read. It was also well written.I fell in love with Will Cooper!! His relationship with Layken was absolutely beautiful! Forbidden love is always the BEST! I'm so glad I read this book! I loved everything about it. I've heard so much about the series, all the hype...and my friends kept telling me how great it was.. I was curious about what was so special about it so I gave it a chance and loved every minute of it! \\"MUST READ\\"
B00683JK9K|4.0|Some very nice graphics, I like that I can choose how many pieces I want a puzzle to be (although when I do the master level the pieces are a bit small on my kindle).  Just wish I knew how to save an unfinished puzzle to go back to later.
B0058RCVYS|4.0|about past mistakes and future opportunities.  It's better not to read a plot summary about this one because the main character only gradually finds out what is really going on.  His orphanage in India is running out of funds unless he can get a Danish billionaire to consider his project more worthy of support than others he is considering.  Of course the rich man has his own goals.  It's up to the viewer to judge if they are realistic or noble.  It isn't the typical cliche of poor man good and rich man bad.  They both have their strengths and weaknesses.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Not one of my favorite Denzel flicks but not bad. Good story line and great graphics. Cant be too bad when Denzel is in it!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I am so excited about a game does not require time limits and extreme hand eye coordination. I am 57 and I have played some older games like Chrono-Trigger, Parasite Eve where I was very challenged for timing and believe me I was a nervous wreck until I finally beat the games after countless hours of retries.<br /><br />This game has all the challenges of seeking elements and crafting and buildiing. I love to meander around in the virtual world discovering new elements. So far I can actually beat most of the monsters and other critters. I have died and drowned a few times, but that's par for the course.<br /><br />This game is killer on the Fire. For the record, this app does work on Archos 3.2, but the screen is too small to use in story mode.  I would recommend this app for the price/enjoyment ratio.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Perfect fit and perfect price.  Fits my iPhone 4 perfectly.  Just thick enough without being too thick/heavy.  Would highly recommend!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great for file system organization. Smooth operation. I have used this program on other aneroid devices and it gets the job done.
B00B7FW6U4|2.0|Very boring, i can't believe i made it through the whole thing, without falling asleep.  If you liked the others, then you may like this... because it was very similar...
1416905014|5.0|I gave this book to a young girl and she loved it.  Pop ups were very good, The coach was wonderfull. I would follow recommendations for 5 and up due to elaborate pop ups.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie!  I like Denzel, and he didn't dissapoint!  Good acting, good story, good movie!  Just watch it.
1608870081|5.0|This pop up book is very intricate.  I enjoyed the book and I kept it in my collection for children to enjoy at my home.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Once again, some great story telling, top notch acting, and awesome special effects.  If you liked the first 2 you have to see this one!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Ordered as used, am sure new was shipped, and  very fast at right price.<br />Will  now review deals more often.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big numbers, easy to read, does the job. It's a calculator. I use it to tally my checkbook. Big enough numbers for my 3rd grader to use and not get frustrated.
0439023521|2.0|I enjoyed the story but it has a few flaws that are hard to ignor. I bought the other two. The third book was written to complete the series but it's sub par.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|This movie was so unbelievably repetitive. It was emotionally moving but the scenes were the same each time between the characters. The acting, especially Helen Hunt's performance was  good, not great. I wouldn't really recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Takes me into a different world. A nice little get away from reality. Very addicting couple, adds a little spice to my way of thinking about love.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Good flick -- better than I anticipated (and a great cast!). It's definitely a an enjoyable movie worth watching. Rent it now!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The author is brilliant she really has enlighten me. Love doesn't have to be the same and boring routine all the time. Also anyone who is truly in love will do anything for the one they love.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat entertainment. Great acting. As in &#34;No Country for Old Men,&#34; Javier Bardem was truly scarey. With Bardem thrown into the mix, I believe this became the best of Bond, grossing over $1 billion.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|I'm pretty sure everyone has watched this movie by now.  We wore out the DVD we had so we ended up buying and downloading the movie to my kindle fire.  This movie is great for kids, hilarious for adults, and definitely one that will be watched over and over.  It's my favorite of all 3 Toy Story movies.
034580404X|1.0|I thought I would give this a try since so many people love this book.  I guess I fall into the hate category.  I can sorta see how this was a rip off of Twilight, however the characters are not even remotely likeable and the writing is HORRIBLE.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|I was a huge fan of the &#34;old school&#34; Dr. Who from the BBC and decided to give the newer series a try. While I found the episodes to be really hit-or-miss, they still encapsulated the same fun spirit that I've come to expect with Dr. Who. Eccleson is a great, eccentric Dr., but his chemistry with Rose is pretty blah. I'm already into the second season and it gets way better, so stick with it.
B008CIUS72|1.0|flash is not working for the silk browser for the kindle HD.<br /><br />Doesn't work for the Silk kindle browser, I tried to get it to work.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I am one of those that have loads chores to do with a great yard, garden, and home.  And I work full time<br />and I live 38 miles away from the nearest town that even has a Walmart!  We love Video on demand I<br />I loved this movie!  Hate to admit I am a over 60 female !
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Trying to get flash to work on the Silk Browser, no flash player seems to work for it. on the Kindel Fire HD
B00APUTEBG|3.0|Movie was great but stopped to load 3-5 times sometimes in very tense times in movie!!! This took away from some of the intensity of the movie!!!!
B005IQZB14|3.0|I've never hiked the Pacific Coast Trail, but I've biked 100 miles. I had no experience biking 100 miles the first time that I did it. But I didn't set out on my first 100-mile ride without lots of training and education. The experience left me with plenty of aches and pains, but I was also glad that I'd spent so much time training. It seemed preposterous to me that anyone would show up for an 1100-mile trek with all their gear still in plastic bags from stores. Even someone who's 28. After talking with a friend who hikes, she told me that this was precisely why she found Strayed's book so difficult to read. The trail and its rigors eventually taught Strayed the respect that she lacked when she started out. For those of us who started outdoor pursuits with a deeper respect for Mother Nature and for the rigors of the journeys, it's necessary to regularly remind ourselves of Strayed's state of mind. She is drowning in grief and, in many ways, untethered from rationality. Keeping that in mind will allow you to stop shaking your head for long enough to get through the series of mishaps that befall the ultimate greenhorn. Otherwise, &#34;Wild&#34; will be tough going.
B008S80OU2|5.0|For a BOC fan - this collection is HEAVEN!!!! Remastered and fabulous previously unreleased material. Thank you BOC and Amazon - you ALL rock!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show, excellent actors! This series appeals to a wide audience, from the sci-fi geeks to the doomsday preppers and everyone in between. I love the brief interjection of American Revolutionary War history by professor. Looking forward to more seasons!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book held my interest until the very, very end. Lena is a wonderfully well-developed character and she takes you on a roller-coaster ride of emotion. I let one of my students borrow it and she loved it too!
0446580848|2.0|It's not good when you want the \\"hero\\" to shut up and grow up even before his long-suffering wife does.  And it's not good to call a supposed hero's wife \\"long-suffering\\" because you start wondering why she stays with such a jerk.  The author just went too far this time with Corey's wise-ass routine, making him seem like a little brat constantly acting out to get the adults' attention.<br /><br />I did appreciate the confirmation that Yemen is every bit as awful as I thought even if most of the information was delivered in very ham-handed dialog that read like a lecture.<br /><br />NIGHTFALL is my favorite John Corey novel but the first two were very good, too, showing him armed with a very bright brain and physical power along with his cynicism and gun. I will read the next John Corey novel in hopes that he has learned to restrain his mouth and the unrelentingly dismal cynicism. If not, I will be divorcing him along with Kate.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|After I had stopped smoking I desperately searched for a good way to do some exercises but not in a typical gym. A friend recommended this book and while reading I really came to like the idea of getting fit at home. It's fun, although I'm only at the basic level, but you have got such a variety of exercises to chose from - it simply never gets boring! I can only recommend this to anyone who is looking for the real deal in bodyweight exercises. Entertaining writing and exercises plus good facts and tips for nutrition and overall knowledge about the body and the exercises!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|If you like action, adventure and surprise this is totally the book for you. This book is part of the mortal instruments series. There are 6 books and they are totally AWESOME!
B003UBTX72|5.0|Funny, sentimental, and informative. Great insight for guitarists. Perfectly describes the ups and downs of being in a band. Loved it.
B002NWOOXW|3.0|Great to see these talented actors, though they are under utelized in this shallow film. Renee Zellweger looks uncomfortably pudgy, which makes it uncomfortable to watch her.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck, is a classic story written in the early 1900's. The story is based on two men and their struggle in life. One man, George, small in nature, looking over his large friend Lennie. This is a definite must read for anyone. This story is very popular and is frequently used as a beginner's read by many high schools across the nation.<br /> George and Lennie first set out to find new jobs after being forced to flee from their current jobs.  At first you are not told why they were fleeing but you knew from the dialect that something bad had occurred and Lennie was to blame. Lennie was a friendly, child-like dimwitted man. What he lacked in brain power he made up tenfold in brawny. He had a large muscular build which enabled him to be a good worker.  George on the other hand, was the complete opposite of Lennie. He was small but definitely smarter than his counterpart Lennie. George looked out for Lennie and tried to keep him out of trouble, albeit an impossible task.<br /> While reading the story you inevitably know the ending before you even get there. At every turn you are expecting the well intended Lennie to do something horrible. George tries to keep him in line and is successful for most of the story.<br /> The main idea is the search for happiness. George and Lennie are working to save enough money to buy their own land and work their own fields. George constantly reassures Lennie that they can achieve their goal and Lennie can have his rabbits to tend to. If Lennie ever slips up then George has to remind him of the future they intended.<br />  John Steinbeck has a tremendous ability to set up a visual representation of his story. In the beginning to every chapter, the landscapes and surroundings are vividly detailed making the reader actually believe he is there watching the events take place. Steinbeck follows his structure throughout the book. Each chapter sets up the scene and the conversations between characters tell the storyfor the remainder of the chapter.<br /> Each character in the story is well described. Always described upon first entering the story.  Steinbeck also ensured that each person was flawed in some way. Each one had their good traits and their bad. George and Lennie seem to be the good guys in the story even though Lennie is a walking nightmare waiting to happen.<br /> You can tell George and Lennie develop a loving relationship. Lennie listens to George and George in return keeps an eye on Lennie. This is definitely a heavy burden placed on George. Finally, in the end Lennie slips up. He kills the boss' daughter-in-law. The event that was being set up all along. A lynch party is sent out to find Lennie. Ultimately it is George that find Lennie. George is forced to kill Lennie for his discretions. Lennie died at the hand of George whilst being promised that brighter future yet another time.<br /> Steinbeck makes it seem as though we're all searching for that brighter future that's just out of our grasp. This is one of those books that you can't put down. Although it is not a long read, it is extremely well written.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I recommend this book. Writing about time travel is full of pitfalls and un-answerables but Stephen King does a good a job as anyone. A well-developed, readable, and compelling story. This book will make one appreciate how hard writing can be.
B003XT60KO|3.0|Mr. Hazlitt had some good points to offer, but there were two things that were diminishing: much of his content was dated (written a half-century ago) and he dwelt on certain issues in far too much detail. I was disappointed.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I loved The Maze Runner.....had a hard time putting it down. I feel as if the ending and subsequent books are probably heading in a direction that I am not interested in. Upon reading reviews of the 2nd book in this series I decided not to read then and end my odyssey here.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Lee Child always writes the attention gripping and suspensful stories that you can get into and enjoy. Any adventure lover will get into this story.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I got this game for free, but I enjoyed it so much I'm going to buy it as well. I grabbed this game because it was free and looked interesting and was hooked immediately. The graphics are very attractive and classy, the music is soothing, and the game has enough variety that it doesn't get boring. Very addictive!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Loved the characters that were easy to picture and become attached to. I enjoyed following the development of the character.  Adventurous story that anyone can enjoy.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits just keeps getting better.  I hope this series continues for many more seasons.  I find myself even starting to like some of the characters that i loved to hate.
B0026772N8|4.0|I read this book 30 years ago at the advice of my psycolgist. I was in my 30's and it had a profound effect on me and would have give it a 5+.I reread it my 50's.and it had a totally different effect. I would have have given it a 4.5. Now that I'm in my eary 70's and reread it I found it depressing. Obviously life changes us all as we age. I still highly recommend it at any age. Tom C
B002RI9BI0|2.0|This book came highly recommended by a source I respect, so I was surprised to find it boring. I would have been better off reading a biography of Siegfried Sassoon, and something on treatment for shell shock in WWI. The most interesting character for me was Rivers, but by the end of the book I still knew little about him. Most unsatisfactory, I had little interest in finishing this book and certainly won't be bothering with the sequels.
B00B9HTK1S|5.0|This book will turn anyone into a true Sherlock Holmes fan.  I've read all the books in the series, and this is by far my favorite.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A barrel of fun fun fun it's really realistic and petting the horses is very horsey whinne I love this game so much the horses love me and poppy cleaning is fantastic and you can imagine the poppy smell
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was told this book was a must read by my beautiful sisters and it certainly was.  Great read, loved it!
1594744769|1.0|I am a fan of fantasy, science fiction, mystery, make-believe, but this book was just plain weird. It started off a bit slow, leaving me hungry for more, but then the more became just plain ridiculous. I can believe in Harry Potter and The Hunger Games, but this book seemed to have very little plot that made any sense and just seemed like childish nonsense to me. I could not wait to finish it, and then the ending was a such a disappointment. I didn't realize I was at the end until I turned the page and there was nothing more, no explanation, no real ending, just leaving everyone on a cliff hanger, where all I wanted to do was push the characters off the cliff and end the suffering so no one else had to endure this book. Go elsewhere for your fantasy or sci-fi. Go anywhere else besides into this book!
B005LAIHPY|4.0|This isn't Hamlet, it's a lot more fun than that.  The special effects are quite good, the credit extended to the old Navy vets is a very nice gesture, the acting is better than any review has given this movie credit for, and it's not the usual alien invasion story.  If you like sf and you like the military, you will enjoy this movie.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This is a great game. very challenging. I highly recommend this game. you will have many moments of interesting game play.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|A rich, multi-layered, intelligent novel that will keep you turning pages. Not only is it a fast-moving romp, but the skilled use of dialogue and historical references gives it a sense of immediacy. This is one that I will probably read again.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great tv show, I had heard such good things about this show I finally watched it and boy it's good!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Intelligent, funny, poignant and full of wisdom.  It also predicted a minority President who chooses to nominate his more experienced political opponent for Secretary of State!!!  Well-written, well-acted, flawless.  If you are interested in how this country works (or should work) and have half a brain - just watch it and enjoy.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book. Story-wise, better than the movie. Although, the movie is worth seeing for Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel's chemistry!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|The story line is great and I really see the characters. Its holding to the books really well so far.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Every one in my family had this game on their Kindle, phone or tablet.  We check each others points to see who is ahead.  Please make more games like this for families like ours.
B001LF347E|5.0|I was really skeptical when I first decided to watch Merlin. It was only because I keep hearing about how great it was that I finally gave it a chance, and am I glad I did. I watched all 5 seasons in the span of about 2 weeks. About 4 episodes in to this season, I was hooked. Yes, it's a little cheesy. Yes, the writing and special effects could be better. But, nothing compares to the relationship of Arthur and Merlin. Seriously one of the best OTP's out there. They annoy the hell out of each other, are constantly chastizing and goofing about the other. But, that's what brothers do. When the time comes, they would do absolutely anything for each other. If you can manage to get past the service flaws, I think everyone would really enjoy this show. It truly has an amazing heart and you will fall in love with these two.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is without a doubt one of the best action/horror/drama shows on television today.  It is the only tv show I know of that combines all of those genres with great story telling and compelling characters.  There is hardly ever a dull moment and I cannot wait to see each episode to come and hope this show lasts for many seasons!!
B0007P3582|5.0|all the songs are hits in my book. keeps it gangsta. great to listen to in the club or just cruising down the street
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great story of human compassion in wartime. It is also provides an insight into the conditions under which US and German pilots flew during the war. I highly recommend this book.
B001QW8QYS|4.0|THE MOVE IS WELL MADE AND VERY GOOD ACTING.  THE SLAUGHTER OF THE WEEK WAS A LITTLE MUCH. THE WORK OF A YOUNG USTINOV AS NERO WAS GREAT.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I loved the book. I really got into it near the end, the suspense was building and then it was finished, I was heartbroken. Can't wait till June for the next one :)
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|I was a young teenager during the Iranian hostage crisis but I don't remember this rescue mission one bit.  It was enlightening to watch.  Ben gets the details right--how people dressed, the music they listened to, the cars they drove.  Suspenseful--the story line moves right along.  He's a great storyteller.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love it now.... at first it wouldn't work so I deleated. it but then I got my Internet back on ( couldn't remember thee password) and re-installed it and tried again and it worked I am so happy its an amazing app I love it
B003SJ4VJ6|2.0|I love the actors in this movie and wanted to like this movie, but it's impossible.  The story just plods along.  This is the classic \\"checking your watch to see how much time is left\\" movie.<br />Too bad--lots of potential, but Polanski misses the mark.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love Taylor Swift and this is a great CD.  I can't wait to see her in concert when she comes to my city this summer.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This movie made me happy.  No new ground broken here.  Just a quirky story about love and hope acted by great actors.  If you like these actors and director, you'll like this movie.<br />It's sweet and has a happy ending....sometimes you just need to watch a movie like this !
B0000256VK|5.0|...but I really wanted this CD. My husband and I used to listen to it when we were dating and fell in love to the haunting melodies. It's also lovely music to set the mood when writing, and the cover art has always called to my inner romantic.
B00AE2J93I|5.0|Great my kids loved it. i did too. great movie for the family. Very funny. um i have nothing else to say
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I bought this game for my Kindle Fire mostly for my kids to play when we were traveling or at the doctor's office, but my husband and I have found it addicting ourselves! We're just as eager to launch the birds and knock down the pigs' dwellings as our kids are, so my whole family gives this a two thumbs up!
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Ver funny movie, just as good as the others if not better. my kids loved it. its a great movie for the family
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young proves that he can still rock out with the best of them. One of his best in years -- a great raging performance backed by Crazy Horse, railing against technology's debasement of culture, the compromised sound quality of MP3s, etc. (&#34;When you hear my song now, you only get 5 percent. You used to get it all. You used to get it all.&#34;) Love it!
0740785508|5.0|This book is absolutely worth reading. I found it inspiring and educational at the same time. Best guide that I have read for a while.
B004LQI1PA|5.0|This is a fantastic production and will appeal to any Les Mis fan. The singing is spectacular! I highly recommend.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|5 star rating for it's caliber of acting and story line.<br />Merlin is now in the position of having to protect King Richard.<br />Morgana is now trying to wrestle Camelot from King Richard which now creates more of a personal struggle between the two characters.<br />Not to mention Merlin was voted the number two most sexest actor in England.<br />Have all the sets and can hardly wait for season 6 to be issued.
B006VP1OYO|5.0|This is a compilation of the EPs from the era that &#34;Isn't Anything&#34; and &#34;Loveless&#34; were made. While I probably like Loveless more than Isn't Anything, I prefer the songs from the first disc that are closer to the Isn't Anything time period. They seem a bit less rushed and more natural. At this point, the first disc seems to have a better start-to-finish goodness, whereas the second disc I skip around on a bit. I do agree that a little more info would have been cool to have in the booklet, but MBV doesn't seem to be the type to do that.<br /><br />Overall, if you like Isn't Anything and Loveless, you will probably really enjoy this. This probably isn't a good place to start for a potential MBV fan, in my opinion. I think it's better to digest their first two LPs beforehand, and form an opinion of them. It's nice to have a bit more variety from MBV in my collection now. Like others have said, this is a much cheaper and more convenient way to get these EPs that are expensive and hard to find.<br /><br />Compared to their first two full length albums, I'd probably rate this at 4 stars. But when just thinking about my feelings of this music compared to music in general, it's definitely 5 stars. I recently rid myself of almost all my cds that I have been collecting for years. I now have a small stack of less than 20 cds and this is one of the ones I kept.
B00628RVV0|5.0|The two boys just send a message of love and friendship that makes one reflect on purpose of life.  Well worthy the money and time.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Just an average read.  Would have been better without the missing years of Memory, except that's how the plot is driven.  Their relationship sort of reminded me of Benny & Joon, but in a not-so-fun way. Got uncomfortable at times due to my own experience with mental health issues. Still want to see the movie.
0780626966|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street series since I was younger.  This includes all the movies that matter not including the Freddy Vs. Jason crap.  I wouldn't mind having this on Blu-Ray though.
B004AOECUG|5.0|Raging Bull is a real american classic, and, that's as much from a cinematographic perspective as it is anything else. The choice to shoot it in B&W was risky, and, it couldn't have paid off more as it enriched the period sense of the film as well as gave a talented director like Scorsese the chance to experience with a new film pallet. I'm sure there are others who can expound much better on the film's amazing cultural impact as well as it's simple and driving facility with the narrative of Jake Lamotta but this transfer looks unbelievable and is well worth the upgrade.
1433524619|5.0|I was referred this translation by my professor and I've never had a translation so clear!  The notes are on point and the images bring the Bible to life!  Every theology student should own a copy of this Bible.
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|I downloaded it because I have ePub files that I wanted to convert to Mobi files so I could read the books. This app doesn't recognize ePub files at all on my Kindle Fire. It was a complete waste of money. DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU ARE CONVERTING EBOOKS!<br /><br />I would LOVE to have my money back. So worthless.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|I really like the movie, BUT I can't understand why the company doesn't mantain the digital copy longer. I just bought it and can't redeem it.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed with this story, the acting, and the whole way the movie leaves you feeling after it's over.  Cool Flick, I would definitely recommend seeing it
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Awesome movie, the music, colors and fun. Also bought it for my girlfriend so she can watch it after every terror movie so she's able to sleep.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed reading it. The end wound down a little more.... abruptly?... than it could have, but I was definitely lost in this book for a little while.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I love this album, not only because every single track is great but because I knew since PP audition he'll win AI. I said it the moment he took his guitar and covered MJ. &#34;Simply&#34; AWESOME talent!!!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I have a apartment with furniture that cannot be moved easilly, it works great, just need to keep it clean and put it on a high place.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I grew up watching Disney movies, and musicals are just great. I'll I love this one and put it to my children, highly recommended.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Was really happy with the price compared to other places and the fact that I received it on the release date.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was pretty engrossed in the first book the minute I started reading it, but this one started off rather slow, with the first half of the book focusing on Katniss's moments of introspection and her life after the Hunger Games.  However, the second half of the book--when the action really starts--was extremely interesting, perhaps even more so than the first book in its entirety!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|It had plenty of action.  But, overall, the movie just was not up to par for James Bond or Daniel Craig.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is a fantastic telling of true American heroes and what they went through for their country.  I highly recommend this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show, but watching it on Amazon is terrible.  I haven't made it through many episodes without the player buffering for extended periods of time.  I have viewed it on different computers with different networks and it is the same.  I might try iTunes next year to see if they are any better.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is wonderful for all ages, well 12 and up. It is a beauty and the beast<br />story about a young boy walking through life with a disfigured face. I love how the<br />author tells the story from different points of view; the family and friends. It is a feel<br />good story and a must read!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really enjoy Pinterest. It gives me a central hub where I can see interesting things. My only complaint would be Pinterest doesn't tell me if I've pinned it before. Of course, that's not much of a complaint.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Very entertaining.  It's a very captivating film from the standpoint of action.  The dialogue will remind you of comic strips and it works fine.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|They stayed true to the original with out making a scene by scene duplicate.  I like the changes in this one, especially that Wren has an uncle who has his back for once.  I grew up watching the original so I was leery of watching the new one but I was not disappointed in the least.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Really liked this book and the movie that was made from it.  The movies are always a little different and you can usually see why they did that.  Always enjoy Nicholas Sparks!
B00A757EFW|2.0|It was similar to the old Arcade game but not exactly.  Not as exciting on a small tablet screen. We kept it.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I loved the first two seasons, but I think its time to call it quits.  Its getting more soap-opera like.  Acting is great.  Costumes are wonderful.  Sets are too artificial.  But store line is getting old.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have the game on my Cell and its hard to see so small.  But its a lot more fun on the tablet.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|The basic story  line was good initially but I rapidly became completely beyond believeability.<br /><br />I always enjoyed Pendergast being today's Sherlok Holmes but as the story progressed his successful evasive actions became more and more juvienile to the extent they detracted from the story line that I thought was a good one.<br /><br />All in all it was a waste of my time.  I always enjoyed the previous Pendercast books.  Hopefully the next book of Pendergast's exploits will return to some sort of reasonableness.
B0063IH60K|5.0|So I have been playing this on my kindle fire for the past few weeks, and I must say for this game being as old as it is, it has yet to lose its flair.  If you are looking to kill sometime without getting sucked in as you might with other games, this game is for you hands down.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|I was using Aldiko Exclusively for a year. They kept promising that they would add the ability to sync reading position across different devices. A month ago, I got tired of waiting and gave the free version of MoonReader a try. Being that I have several pdf files - I hesitated to use this at first, but am pleasantly surprised with how great this app works.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Works great with PDF: multi-page view supported.<br />- Syncs reading position across devices.<br />- Looks great! Page turning animations are a fun plus.<br />- Lots of options!<br /><br />Only Con:<br />- Doesn't support DRM Files, but I've been able to remove DRM from books that I own with Calibre.<br /><br />Devices:<br />Transformer pad tf300t (running cyanogenmod 10.1)<br />Nexus 4 (stock)
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed the book all the way up until the ending. I felt the storyline was awesome and I really couldn't put the book down. However, I really did not like the ending. I feel there needed to be some sort of justice for Nick and the good cop Boney. I am disappointed in the ending and think there needs to be a sequel of some sort to round out the ending.
B00A14V0MM|5.0|Dubious distinction, I know, but on top of that, Silver Linings Playbook is quite simply one  of the best, most romantic movies I've ever seen. Love everything about it.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|thought this was a cute movie good graphics and good for kids i would buy it as a gift for kids
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A beautiful story of love and courage. A real tear-jerker. Action-packed with all the ingredients required for brilliant reading. A gripping read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I truly enjoy all of Grisham's books but have usually been disappointed by the conclusions.<br />Finally a book that left me feeling satisfied.  Thank you Mr. Grisham.
B003BKZW7C|5.0|In true Steven King style, the characters have real depth, the story is excellently woven and the book constantly keeps you gripped. Scary reading...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Reminds me of the Merchant/Ivory movies of the 90s.  Wonderful show, great characters, amazing set and scenery.  I always look forward to the next episode.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game will keep you on the edge of your seat; I get so excited that I have to put it down for awhile because my adrenalin is so high
B008ASGP3U|4.0|I'm sure it was difficult bringing Rebus out of retirement, somewhat like Connerlly and his LA Detective Bosch. Having read Ian's books from the earliest and having a good deal of admiration for the &#34;Slightly Superior&#34;, Edinburgh I am prejudiced. As plot that seemed a bit forced to wind up the case . . . but an artist's privledge, eh?
B006YB9VJU|4.0|Beautiful smart tags!!! the size is soft and the colors is beauty. I like it smart tags, work correctly thanks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the entire series. Very quick read with lot's of action. The movie didn't do it justice but there is so much they can do on film.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Nothing better than all seasons of Downton Abbey. The world adores it! There is not other TV show that compares with the human experience of Downton...
B007712XAU|5.0|A friend told me about Downton Abbey and that she has been watching it since its inception.  I bought the first 2 seasons and enjoyed them so much I now am watching the 3rd season.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|It is nice to have the availability of the Google app.  I have utilized it many, many times since it was set up on my Kindle fire.
B008B1VYP0|3.0|Some of the songs are excellent, others are just OK. The most popular songs are the best on the CD.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|i Started Playing This Game and Didnt Realize Til Like an Hour Later That iLike it Pretty Well Definatly a Distraction if You Wanted One..
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have all of Josh's CD's and this is in my opinion his very best work.  The songs are all memorable and I just can't stop singing!  I have loved all of his CD's (except not so much Illuminations)and this one is just outstanding!  I dare you to buy it and not have these songs running through your head all day long!  I really think this is a Grammy winning production for sure!  Best album in the classical genre.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I recommend this to anyone that likes match type games. Load of fun and very addictive. Great colors and designs and before you know it you have complete several rounds.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|fun as described but not at all soothing. refresher on obstacles not available and only one way to earn hints. becomes frustrating eventually.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A wonderful story!  Really opens your eyes to the difficulties some people experience. Thought provoking and timely since death with dignity is such a controversial issue in today's society.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I liked this book until the near end. I feel like that's all I can say without ruining it... just disappointing.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is my favorite series but I think it is still one or two episodes to go.  The actor that plays Oliver Queen is very good.  I did not read the comic but I saw the green arrow or emeral arrow on Smallville.  I hope this series get a great review.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|This game started out great.  Lots of fun. Challenging.  After a few months it got buggy: balls change color, the game terminates unexpectedly.  Reloaded from the cloud, did not help.  Too bad. This WAS an excellent game.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Some action.  sort of disjointed.  Older actors trying to be their younger selves.  Hard to believe.  I wouldn't buy again.
0307341550|5.0|Flynn can do no wrong! This book is so well written and an excellent mystery. I've read Gone Girl (EXCELLENT!!!!) and this is my 2nd book of hers. Next I'll read Dark Places. iIwish she had more books to read! I'm hooked!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best soap opera of all time!  Great to see how things were in the 1920's in England
B00846F1YW|5.0|Good product.  Just like on my desktop.  But now I can use it on the go with my phone.  Thanks.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Holy smoke! I gave this a 5 star rating because I simply love love love this game and when you play the cube attack<br />you eyes feel like they are moving a million miles a minute! Yes a spin for Rubiks but I can actually conquer this game<br />and I can't recommend it enough to anyone with sharp eyes and quick fingertips. Try it!
B009O07NDY|5.0|This 2 CD album provides presumably all the music from Peter Jackson's The Hobbit part one. Howard Shore obviously enjoys returning to his successful earlier movies. Some of the tracks are quite short, and you can proceed to another track much more quickly than you think. The performances, as expected, are first-rate.<br /><br />Some tracks say &#34;extended&#34; on them, and I have to wonder if Jackson is planning on giving us an &#34;extended edition&#34; of the movie on DVD/Blu-Ray.<br /><br />My ownly quibble is in the program booklet. There are places where the print is orange against a brown background and at such a small size that reading the notes becomes a moot point. It looks almost like solid lines. Come on! Not all of us have brilliant eye-sight, but when even a magnifying glass doesn't help, the time has come to complain.
B002Z5FM74|1.0|I bought this flash drive to put music files on, to play in my automobile. Files would appear to save, and would show up in the file list, but would not play in my automobile. I would hear part of a song, then my car stereo would display the message &#34;Cannot read device&#34;.<br />After several attempts to delete and re-save my music files, I gave up on this device. Since I only paid $10 for it, it was not worth my while to complain to the supplier.<br />I went back to using my old HP 2GB flash drive, which still works perfectly.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle's singing on this CD is gorgeous. Each selection picks us up and transports us to her world. The presence of Michael Crawford in the selection from Phantom is a particular plus. Susan Boyle's style of singing is not flashy, nor is it covered by stage motions and production numbers around her. Her voice and her personality put these songs across. Pop producers take note please.  As on previous CDs of Ms. Boyle, the accompaniments are a little too loud. Also a fault with pop singers today, but in most cases that's a blessing. The singing flaws are covered up, too.<br /><br />About the time this CD came out, Susan Boyle was shown on TV &#34;forgetting the words&#34; to a song. Just before she faltered in the song, she made gestures that seemed to me to say, &#34;Turn the accompaniment down. It's too loud.&#34; In frustration she paused in her singing. Idiot pundits said she forgot her words. I don't believe that at all. I think she was trying to seize artistic control of her prerecorded accompaniment, which even in the quiet beginning of the song threatened to overwhelm her.
B00633W614|4.0|This is a very good read. Brings you back in time to how things were, and how little people actually change. I had a hard time putting it down, real page turner.
0385536828|5.0|A strong and even narrative (think Graham Greene) with a penchant for the provocative (Anaïs Nin).  Throw in an M. Night Shyamalan twist and you have the latest from England's favorite son.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I enjoyed Downton Abbey much more and had just watched it, but it is growing on me.  Very good acting
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|So far so good the show is as advertised. Each episode has been better than the previous episode. Must say looking forward to the rest of the season.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I fully enjoyed this series.  I only wish there had been more Seasons to watch.  I missed the people when it was over
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous makes any man think about priorities and forces him to make a twofold decision: Are you willing to become the man, husband and father God wants you to be? And, are you willing to pay the price this privilege entails?
B007TXN4TK|4.0|fun game and even the few songs you get on the &#34;free&#34; version are cool. It makes you feel somewhat like you are playing the piano and has some challenge to it at times, when you speed up the tempo. that is a nice feature for this game.
B00931JMRE|4.0|I have been listening to the &#34;Top&#34; every since the 70's and have seen them several times in concert. This album goes back to their basic blues background and I have to say that they still have it. It is a very good album and I listen to it often.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love most bingo games but this one is the best so far. i like the sounds and the screens too. easy to use and fun.
B00136JS12|5.0|Classic Rock, Boston's first and in my opinion their best album. I enjoy listening to their special style of music and although it is not as classical as Jimmy Hendrix it is still good music.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I love the modern take these accomplished musicians have to the music they play.  Very enjoyable.  Shared it with my grandchildren (one is a cello player) and they also loved the music.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is a very good and easy read.  I have seen the movie countless times, but it is nice to read the book version.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I loved all three books. I was sad when I finished them that there was no more to read. I really felt like I was there watching it all unfold. Great writing!!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This series has really caught my attention so far.  I am a big fan of Dexter on Showtime and this has been nearly as addictive!  Fast paced, twisted, and exciting!  I love that they are running the season straight through, no repeats, so each week is new. Can't wait for the next episode!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids absolutely love this game. Very good at teaching the concept of money.would recommend for kids 6 and older.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Fun read. Nice twist on the genre .... Humans having prevailed. I am looking forward to the movie, though I am not sure how well the book will translate to the big screen.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Brilliantly written and beautifully produced this series is what television should be.  If you haven't been watching from the beginning I strongly suggest you go back and watch the previous seasons.  They are all excellent.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this , my kids love it as well.  We could play this game all day and night.  Thank you
B001NHNG64|4.0|I started the Reacher series at the recommendation of my sister-in-law.  Yes, girls do love Jack Reacher even though his &#34;bad a--&#34; character would also be a hero of any red-blooded male.  The story lines are very different between No. 1 and No. 2, while remaining true to the persona of Reacher.  I'll keep reading.
B00004YA66|5.0|I think I've seen this movie 50+ times since I first saw it. The relationship between the son and his dad reminds me of my relationship with my dad. It gets me every time and I still cry. Love, love, love it!
B001O1O71C|5.0|The reason I chose that rating is because the Book was amazing and it was better than all the books I have read in my life!I loved everything in it !!!!!!!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Not only did I receive the movies quick, it was perfect in it's package. It's always nice to get an item without any damage. I am in love with the Harry Potter series, so this is perfect for the Potterhead like me!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Entertaining and interesting. A little bit gory at times, but overall a great show with great human frailty issues. Saw the 1st season in 1 week!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I don't have much else to say other than that I love this movie! It's a true classic and I never get tired of it!
B009VB97EY|5.0|Loved it!! They all looked so good, I have watched it several times on DVD and seen it in the theater
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was so dubious of Daniel Craig as James Bond after seeing him in Road to Perdition.  But he totally nails the essence of an aging yet still oh-so-sexy 007.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We have really enjoyed watching this series - very entertaining and we've learned alot about that timeframe.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00846F1YW|4.0|have been enjoying this app. I was pleasantly surprised by the story dialog.  The graphic content is nicely done.<br />can't wait to get to the next chapter.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Good movie, well acted but very scary.  ould not have wanted to be on that flight.  Glad the pilot got the punishment he deserved.
1451695195|5.0|This book is well written.  The subject matter is enthralling and certainly deals with an important issue in a very truthful manner.<br />I would definitely recommend reading this book.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'm not usually a person that buys albums because I feel like artists use so many terrible fillers to finish cd's. This is the first album I've bought in years, and its truly an awesome album.. I've heard it through a few times now and there isn't a single song I will skip. This album is dope, macklemore is dope, and thrift shopping is very dope. Long story short, if you want some non garbage to listen to, get this cd, its well worth it
0307720950|5.0|If you are not already convinced that technology is once again revolutionizing the world, you will be after reading Makers.  Chris Anderson explains how the rapidly emerging technologies of digital manufacturing and 3D printing are going to revolutionize the manufacturing industry.<br /><br />In the near future the everyday consumer will be able to design their own products that they can sell to others or print on-demand in a home workshop.  And those who lack the inventiveness to design something new will be able to copy and reproduce objects simply using a 3D scanner and printer.<br /><br />Makers is a book about how technology is democratizing access to manufacturing capacity and Internet distribution.  It is a book about the emerging long tail of products that will put an end to the blockbuster model which has monopolized industry for over a century.  It is a book about how the economy is splitting into companies focused on atoms and others focused on bits.<br /><br />Readers will learn about:<br />* Communities of auto hobbyists designing their own vehicles that can be assembled in local factories, completely bypassing the big automakers.<br />* Aerospace companies that self-print the components for their own spacecraft, avoiding the bureaucratic and politicized government subcontractor model.<br />* Machines that will print human organs on-demand for needy patients, circumventing the complex and lengthy organ-donor process.<br /><br />Makers examines these revolutionary changes from all angles - the discussion is not limited to manufacturing industry and the supply chain.  For example, Makers also examines how the retail sector will be disrupted as more inventors introduce new products onto marketplaces such as Etsy, Shapeways, Quirky and Ponoko.  And Anderson discusses how crowdfunding models such as Kickstarter, RocketHub and Crowdfunder are going to act as catalysts for micro-enterpreneurs seeking investment capital.<br /><br />This is the most thought-provoking book I have read in the past year.  I highly recommend it.

B002XTXG1G|5.0|How could you not love this movie. Tom Hardy is enchanting and extreme. He is a wonderful actor and easily pulls you into this bizarre and wild story. This is one of my top most watched movies!
B003M70O5O|5.0|I just started watching and I watched 5 seasons in 2 weeks I love this show can't wait for season 6
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This album is wonderful, so beautiful and unique, she is a rare talent and I hope she sticks around for a long long time!
B009GEDP26|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this season of Castle.  They seem to have the right mix & intrigue on the Castle/Beckett romance & the mystery each week as to who did the killing.  I especially enjoyed the Valentines episode where they didn't know whwther the Captain was going to find out about them because Richard left Beckett's gift in her office in error.  It has been a fun season to watch.  Recommend this show very highly.
B006ZEDZNY|4.0|I know a lot of people weren't very impressed with this movie, but with Amber Heard and Johnny Depp I don't really see anything to complain about. Good acting, good movie.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book was recommended to me. At the beginning I was not very sure about it since it seemed to develop slowly, but as I got into the middle of the book I started to enjoy it a lot.<br /><br />I really like the analogies that the author makes with different believes / religions in order to make his point.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to learn how to live in the present and defeat the ghosts of the past and the future.
B007H7XJD4|3.0|had a lot of potential but overall pretty lack-luster. The acting wasn't anything to brag about nor the story. It just left a lot to be wanted.
B005VOXPO8|5.0|A great piece and a fine representation of an African Elephant. I like how they handled it being a male.
B000FC10WU|4.0|Charming and intelligently written. Slip away into the small English village for a few hours and dare to match wits with Miss Marple.
B00008BXJ6|3.0|I have often listened to AC / DC music played in the background on radio and have become attracted by the great sounding and hard-hitting guitar riffs. Usually I have lost interest again because of the length and monotony of the songs - and a singer that easily gets on my nerves.<br /><br />The very funny and entertaining movie &#34;School of Rock&#34; in which Jack Black performs several of the group's early numbers gave me, however, encouraged me to learn more about the group.<br /><br />This early album contains the great &#34;It's a Long Way to the Top&#34; and others of the group’s well-known numbers, but again I have conclude that small doses of this band work best for me.<br /><br />All is well produced (Vanda / Young) and well played - lyrics that may provoke but with a twinkle in the eye, solid numbers which, however, easily may appear somewhat identical.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|I've been listening to Kid Rock for years, I think my tastes in music have slowing changed over the years, as has Kid Rocks music.  This has amazing songs beginning to end, not a bad single on the entire album.
B0035XVVDY|4.0|I watched Law Abiding Citizen (which I saw in first release) to compare its structure with a screenplay in the same genre and was reminded that it provides an excellent thriller paradigm for the Hollywood thriller. Good performances, fast pacing. I like that you're not sure whether Jaimie Fox or Gerard Butler is the villain.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoyed playing a game that was both challenging as well as engaging.  It offered different levels and types of play such as timed play.  I am not a regular game player but found this to be lots of fun.  On the downside, I believe that it can only be played on a touch screen.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|A completely different movie from the Swarchenegger original. Good performance by Colin Farrell. Bryan Cranston chews the scenery. Good SPFX.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Love this movie! Watched the last scene about 20 times! Streaming it through amazon prime was really easy and it didn't buffer at all. There was a tinyag between video and audio but not so noticeable that it ruined the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series! I really should get the DVDs.I highly recommend this Masterpiece Classic. I am looking forward to season 4.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|Concise, realistic for home use.  Possibly the best health book I own.  Gifting this book to those I love.  Your health is in your hands.  Take control.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|its awesome!has more difficulty than the first and more obstacles.But I noticed that there's some glitches that can really mess up what u do but all in all its great works on kindle to.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it its better than the computer version. I play it all the time and love how easy it is and very very fun.
0307200477|1.0|Don't buy this. I thought buying the deluxe edition would prevent the pages from falling out and it does not.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I always, always enjoy Judith Dench. She is always tremendous! I watch her every week on As Time Goes By. The entire cast were great. Great plot.
B002ZG976U|5.0|it is a very good movie for a good price. I enjoyed it. I am not sure what else to write
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was a stretch of the imagination but with imagination anything can happen! Just think God imagined the world and with words spoke it into existence.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great with kindle fire hd. Great for back up. I keep it in my bag just in case and one at home.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. I had heard comments that the ending was not good, but I found it to be hopeful and then when I read the comments on the actual couple I was very happy.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great Book, suspenseful and a Great Read ! I couldn't put it down.  I loved all the twists and turns and psychological issues that made Christian the man he was.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a fun game that I would highly recommend to anyone who has children or grandchildren.  I enjoyed it myself also, it was fun for the whole family.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|It will not stay upright in an area that is busy, but it is worth the price. I like the elastic band the holds it closed. There  is no space for a stylus, but I just hook that on the elastic band.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game. It keeps your mind working. I could spend hours on this one. It is very addictive. I highly recomend this app.
B000001EJ8|5.0|Very enjoyable. Recommend it . I like Vangels creations and this one is as enjoyable as many of his other creations.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I play This game all Night. Its very challenging and well put together. It would be great to have more games similar to This. Love this game!
B00BETX5PS|2.0|A decline from Casino Royale and Quamtum Solace. Cheesee rides again. Not quite serious not quite comdecy, not quite there.
B000FC0ZEO|4.0|Good writing, somethimes a little bit too long and comlicated, but not bad.<br />Clasic medieval fantasy.<br />Intresting life and humanity ideas.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I only watched it because all my friends were talking about it...WOW was I surprised!  I LOVE the time period and the characters.  I started watching and couldn't quit!  I'm a castle lover and this house is amazing.  I watched 2 seasons right away and couldn't get enough.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|it's just what we needed, to relax and enjoy when we have time off ; we haven't seen many of them, so it's that more pleasure !
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Extremely well acted by Denzel Washington.  Heartbreaking story of what substance abuse can do to your life and those around you.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|Great add to my cd collection.I still have the vinyl  ! This is one of the best by the Doors !
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the evolution of the social history through the servants and aristocracy.  The story line and characters continue to have depth and interest to the viewer.  I look forward to each episode!
B001NLL93W|4.0|She's not the best writer, however the story plot is entertaining. The characters are believable and this isn't your typical vampire/ werewolf/ anything else story you may have read about. It's a story about everything at once.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I have always been a fan of Star Trek and JJ Abrams version is just brilliant. It allows anyone to start here, rather than in the mid to late 1960's and onward. Special effects were great and the characters were perfect picks. They all did a great job in their parts.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|I didn't really like this movie. I loved the original and I thought the special effects were good but overall it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen.
B005LAII80|4.0|The movie arrive when they said it was going to. The movie was good and had some great 3D effects..
B009VB7QQA|1.0|This was a terrible movie. I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money in the theaters to see this.
B001C4AFOY|3.0|The story line was fast and loose with the truth, I prefer the facts, and not someone's version of what might have been.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|The movie surprised me. After the 1st 5 or 10 minutes, i thought \\"oh boy, this is going to be baaaaad....\\". But the story starts taking shape and completely pulls you in. The scenes from throughout the Pittsburgh area look incredible as well - showing one reason why an incredible number of films are being done there. Gorgeous area.<br />There are a number of 'negative' reviews on here and i think most haven't even seen the movie (even though some \\"claim\\" they have just to negatively review it). People need to get over the fact that Cruise is playing the part of the 6'5\\" Jack Reacher. The fact is, he nails the role. The reason he got the job is his incredible skills and adaptability.<br />The much talked about \\"car-chase\\" scene is one of the best of the last 20 years. Why? 2 reasons. One, is its very realistic. Too many car chases i see in movies are so far-fetched ridiculous that they're actually boring. Two, the sound. This is without question the most realistic \\"sounding\\" car chase i've seen. The engine shifts and noises make you feel like you are right there, if not in the car itself.<br /><br />The twists and turns in the story and the eye-candy scenery from the Pittsburgh area make this film one that can be watched repeatedly - making a Blu-Ray purchase a no-brainer. I'm actually looking forward to that more than i did when i went to the theater to see it.<br />Of course, its an action-type film in many regards, so one must take the slightly \\"dumbed down\\" approach to it, but its light years better than duds such as Expendables 2.<br />I give it 4, maybe 4.5 stars, as i really enjoyed it. A worthwhile purchase for repeated viewings, especially if you're a Cruise fan.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|A very enjoyable video.The story of Miss potter and Peter Rabbit was fun to watch.<br /><br />Renee' Zellweger did great job.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|shipped quick and came packaged in a clam shell like you would get in the store.  This sharpener was able to sharpen a knife i had badly damaged over the years quickley and easliy.
0143119680|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, the first book in a trilogy of books about Diana and Matthew.  There is some unexpected twists and turns to keep the pace going and I love that Diana grows to learn that she uses her powers far more than she realized.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is worth what you pay but I find to be better to get the game for the computer or Xbox. Pocket edition is great for playing minecraft on the go but I  nothing compared to the pc download. There I  just so much more that this game could have and it seems to get better with every update.
B008NMT684|5.0|perfect for my toddler. he loves it! it keeps him very busy while we wait for his sister at dance class.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I liked it but wasn't as good as the books before this one... was very good... not great as usual.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Final installment was as good as anticipated. Wrapped up the saga nicely and was a plausible conclusion...<br />Will there be more????
0062502182|5.0|This book has been a great inspiration in my life and I always have a copy nearby, sometimes opening it on a random page and reading from there. Less of that lately, probably because by now, I know it almost by heart..<br /><br />Highly recommend it to anyone that feels there is more to life than thoughts, analysis and fears.
B000O59A2K|4.0|Because it was 2 good movies i remember seeing when i was a kid a long time ago  .<br />.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very good book....interesting till the last page....I had not read any of her books till now. but I certainly will keep her name in mind....
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Satisfactory story line but somewhat predictable.  As a rule I love his books but this one did not keep me totally engaged. It almost seemed like a no win situation for Amanda and Dawson.The ending was tragic and a little unbelievable and at some point before predictable.
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|This movie was so true to life and what couples go through after many years of marriage and to see how each had their own view on what brought them to this stage of their marriage.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is such a pleasure to read a book written so well. The story was unpredictable and exciting, with twists and turns, and poetic justice. I guess I'm so used to reading books that have been 'dumbed down' to attract a wider audience that I'm thrilled to read some big words here and there. I immediately read her previous two novels, loved them also, and convinced all the readers I know to read them too. I had put this book off for quite awhile, afraid to be lured into another tale of heaving bosoms and unbridled passion, but Gillian Flynn is so far above that trash. I wish she would write faster.
B00AH69MS8|5.0|Classic Metallica in every sense. Great album; every song is what Metallica has represented for more than a decade. Can't miss with this if you're a fan.
0385474547|3.0|It came in a cheap package.<br /><br />It says online that it was used but 95% good but it looked like a 65% good.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The characters were believable, by the end of the story I knew them well. The story captured my interest and satisfied me. I would read more by this author. It was a great weekend read. I highly recommend it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is the bestest game in the world I will stay on it for hours.a really good game for 12 and under
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My grand children love playing this game and no trouble down loading works good.  That all I have to say
B002C4PWD2|1.0|The worst movie I have seen in a long time, it was painfully bad. After investing 45 minutes of my life on this movie I continued to watch just in hope of something worthwhile happening but it never did.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love fb on the iPad better than on my iphone and the way it works I have hard time with window 8 and the way it works
0307730697|5.0|Wonderful and exciting book on how God works in a person's life,even when things seem so desperate. I think men and women alike will enjoy this book.
0061743526|5.0|Honestly one of my favorite books! The second I started reading I couldn't put it down. I highly encourage others to read.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Now that I have completed PROOF OF HEAVEN, and its appendix of miscellaneous notes allotted to 25% of the book's entire contents, I am ready to review what Dr. Alexander's extended family did in the waiting room for seven days.<br /><br />This was my first NEAR BOOK EXPERIENCE in the field, to put it mildly.  That which drew me (and apparently many others) toward the widespread national exposure of the book's highly credentialed author led to a journey which never left beyond the hospital's cafeteria.  The book's self-proclaimed purpose of sharing an intellectual's experience in the afterlife could be summed up (in percentages) in the single digits; the vast remainder covered the doctor's \\"living\\" experiences, such as his career, aspects of family history and an unsolved childhood issue all nicely interwoven with medical theories to conclude support of his NDE - one which, oddly enough, was rather brief or without much convincing recollection/discussion at length.<br /><br />Consequently, the value of PROOF OF HEAVEN is not weighed in any detail (or lack thereof) of the doctor's NDE, but mostly in his explanations of neurology as it may pertain to the functions of the brain during a comatose state.  It was certainly understood to read and share in his joy to recover and return to his family, etc, but that was understood upon the book's purchase.  Noticeably absent was an actual \\"journey\\" of the NDE itself...which read more like an uneventful ride on the downtown bus going two stops to the parking garage.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Repetitive descriptions, annoying characters, why is this series so popular?  The scenario is about as plausible as the movie Pretty Woman.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I recommend to anyone who likes to read romance story. I wonder which is better the book or the movie? well I have to see the movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|My grandkids play with my kindle and they like the puzzles.<br />I like it because it makes them think of the possibilities of completing the puzzles.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who likes to challenge their mind, but not so much.
B007HACDLK|3.0|In this latest Mitch Rapp episode, there seems to be a lot more emphasis on violence and use of vulgar language (primarily the &#34;F&#34; word) than in past books.  Maybe this is done to show the continuing degeneration of Rapp's psyche, but so much seems unnecessary.  The main premise of the story wasn't that interesting to me, and the &#34; extreme torture&#34; endured by the kidnapper agent to &#34;sell&#34; the agent's &#34;death&#34; to the CIA seemed preposterous.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds much in the news.  It helps him in his coordination.<br />Don't need to recommend to others as Angry Birds are self recommended.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I downloaded this app to read scanned PDF files. The app seems to freeze up and does not allow me to scroll through the pages so I just use my kindle reader instead.
B000TEPEJO|5.0|I love this cd. I have slways enjoyed thier music. they have such beautiful voices. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is probably one of the best i have ever played. It is very fun and addicting. Over all I absolutely LOVE the game.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I really like this game and it has a lot of different levels. I would recommend this to other people
0756405890|5.0|First off. my favorite authors are Lois McMaster Bujold (Vorkosigan Series), Brandon Sanderson, Steve Erikson, C.J. Cherryh, Robert Heinlein, Patrick Rothfuss...I am a voracious reader of speculative fiction.  The story is what makes a book, the story drives the theme, and thus the series.  What Rothfuss has created with the story of Kvothe and The Name of the Wind, is nothing short of masterful story telling.  If you like your stories long, hard, dirty, and fantastical, than you will find yourself lost in the story of Kvothe.  It is safe to say that his is a seminal piece of \\"fantasy\\".  Sometimes though, a novel comes along that tends to blur the line between fantasy, fiction and history.  Yes, this is a fantasy novel because of its elements, however, you do not only have to be a fantasy novel fan to enjoy masterful storytelling.  If you are looking for long drawn out battle scenes, do not open this book, if you are looking to get lost in an epic adventure, do open this book.  Rothfuss has created perhaps one of the greatest fantasy stories ever told, and I believe that when all is said and done, this will be right up there with \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\", \\"The Malazan Book of the Fallen\\", \\"Stromlight Archive\\", and a few select others, as the greatest series of all time.  The difference between Patrick's novels and the others however, is that The Name of the Wind is more than a fantasy novel, it is a classic book, and a classic story that will only get better with time.  \\"A Wise Mans Fear\\", is just as good, and propels the story to new heights.  If you are thinking about reading this, or buying this, think no more.

B00846F1YW|4.0|It's a find the hidden object game. I like these, even though I play it on my phone. About the only complaint I guess I can think of is that when I pinch the screen to take a closer look or move the flashlight around, it counts those as guesses.
B0037NVM1I|4.0|It was as good as the first and tied the two [movies] together. The series should have ended there, as #3 was like a reoccuring nightmare. None have been as good as #1 & #2
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a good departure for Sparks...there are twists in the plot, some predictability, but an edgy book none the less.  Wrapped into a somewhat predictable finish, is an interesting turn that leaves you thinking long after you finish the book.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|The extension doesn't really do anything because you have to push a button further up on the shaft, which means your hand is the same distance from the light. But I couldn't care less about that because it's totally awesome and authentic.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I figured hey, I'll try it.  Poke a bit, something to do when needed.  I CAN'T STOP!  It's beyond addictive, it combines elements of mahjong and more but better than anything else I've seen online.  Flows seamlessly on a tab that likes to have running issues with things and I've doing Android ICS at the moment.  Allows tweets of achievements, very interactive, but way beyond what I expected.  Now I'm stuck swiping and poking for hours til the battery dies! LOL
B005PR422K|5.0|Eric Ries shares many startup stories that demonstrate his valuable insights. Reading The Lean Startup will help entrepreneurs build their startups faster and better.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Excellent love story. heartwarming relationships between species. Hoping for the same if we ever encounter extraterrestrials. Followup series was also quite entertaining
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The best human interest story ever. Would recommend this book for anyone who lived through this most unfortunate time in our great history.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think it is a very fun game but when I shut my kindle or phone off it erases all my progress and becomes very frustrating
B0080BFVPU|4.0|Cleverly written screenplays seem to have gone into limbo (the Coens notwithstanding), and \\"Grosse Pointe Blank\\" appears to be among the last until audience taste improves.<br /><br />A Government hit man (John Cusak) returns to Grosse Pointe MI, to take out a target, attend his 10th-year high-school reunion, and romance the woman (Minnie Driver) he ran out on ten years ago. What you won't know until you see it is how brilliantly written (and acted) it is.<br /><br />There's a lot of good scenes, but the standout (for me) is Cusak's session with this psychiatrist. Their ping-pong interaction is so wittily constructed that it makes a screenwriter-wannabe (myself) despair.<br /><br />I'd love to give GPB five stars, but Cusak's relationship with Driver is not particularly engaging. Other than her hippieish, Leftward-leaning perspective, we really don't know who she is, or why she ever found him attractive in the first place. For this viewer, their bantering (however clever) seems mostly pointless and often interminable. Nick and Nora they ain't. I'm also bothered by the fact that Cusak's target turns out to be someone who can (conveniently) resolve Cusak's problems if he /isn't/ killed. But GPB is a farce, so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much.<br /><br />The rest of the film, though, is a hoot. Recommended for one viewing -- and multiple viewings of the best scenes (particularly the convenience-store shootout).
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book was fantastic! Made me eager to read the rest! I can't wait to get all of the rest!
B005FISBTO|5.0|If you are a Dexter fan, then you will want all the seasons. We DVR all the episodes of the season, then watch them one after another. (we can't wait for a week to go by for the next one!) When Season 7 comes out on DVD, you bet we will purchase Season 7 from Amazon.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I enjoyed his second album even more than the first. I like the variety in his music. He definitely isn’t like the other cookie cutter pop on the radio.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Wonderful plot and plot development. A real education on facts of WWI I never knew. A must read for young adults.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it looks like a calculator feels like a calculator and its the best working calculator app in the store .
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Not particularly well written nor entertaining. Can not recommend to readers of any age. Disappointed as reveiws were so good.
B000FC130E|5.0|This is my first Neil Gaiman book, and I thought it was well written and had a great story line. I wouldn't recommend it for children even though it may have a &#34;fairy tale&#34; premise. It may be a bit shocking for younger readers, but it's still a great read.
B001O4WNCE|5.0|This is a classic for those of us into this venue. Just really a silly, fun movie from our class at SNL and 2nd City. Getting both movies is great from the storage standpoint alone...not to mention the fact that once you've watched the first one, you start thinking about the second one again. Good quality picture for non-blue ray.....no issues.
B005LAIISA|4.0|good movie for my kids, they love it. wish the writers had done more  with the theme and story as we all love the Ice age stories
B0032SMR1W|4.0|We start the film with a typical 1970s Washington D.C. middle class family.  The father works for NASA, the mother as a teacher, their kid goes to private school.  Then, a mysterious man enters their life and presents them the title Box.  The box is a large push button.  The man says &#34;If you press this button within the next 24 hours, I will give you one million dollars, tax free.  But, someone you do not know will die.  And, the box will be given to someone else...someone who you do not know.&#34;<br /><br />Obviously, someone in the family pushes the button, setting off the main plot.  The man reappears, gives them the million dollars, and leaves.  But, they start having serious regrets, so the father goes to try to uncover the mystery behind the man, despite being told specifically not to do so.  He starts to uncover evidence of a conspiracy, and finds the man is really not what he appears.<br /><br />Some may find the movie becomes very surreal at certain points, but the movie itself raises a good question.  How much are you willing to harm another human being for your own ends?  In fact, we find the group sending out the boxes is running a test to find how many people are willing to do this.<br /><br />If you want to watch a thought provoking sci-fi drama, this is worth watching.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|good movie, not our fav. Story is ok, but showing a child disobeying parents is not always a great way to teach our kids the meaning of honoring your parents wishes.
1250006341|2.0|The best part was the pictures, ad cast comments. The text is dull, and not terribly interesting.  Stick to watching the show!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|bought it for grandchildren,,,they love it, watch it over and over, lots of color, good plot/story. well done and i think a good selection if you are looking for Christmas story
B006964E8S|3.0|Writing in the same sub sub genre as Lee Child, Baldacci has made a good fist of it, though the Puller/Reacher comparisons are valid. Puller is a darker character than Reacher, perhaps a little too morbid, and Baldacci, as usual, piles on a few too many coincidences.  I also was not convinced much on the wrap.<br /><br />Baldacci fans will enjoy and those that need their fix of Reacher more than once a year, will be won over - like I was.<br /><br />I thought the next story - The Forgotten - was better.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its ok I guess but since I just started I not really sure soooo. we'll see but so far its good
B008Q09K2U|2.0|Very little action, very little of anything really, other than Corey making smart comments.  I like Corey's comments as much as the next person, but not when he endlessly makes the same ones - really.<br /><br />Still Nelson DeMille is just too good a writer to make a stinker, so this is readable for DeMille/Corey fans - just.
B0093ST02E|2.0|I was hoping it would all make sense by the end, but it didn't. In fact, it ended quite abruptly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing I enjoy playing it I just wish you could ride the horse without competeing kking out peace
B004WOH18E|3.0|Archer always writes a good story.  This must be one of his earlier books.  I enjoyed it but found the ending  ran out of steam.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game its fun and easy! every one needs to get it! its so much fun! and I love to play it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|N.sparks never disappoints me! Great story line. Hard to put it down! Just fall in love with ♡♥Katie♥♡ 5 stars Can't wait to see the movie now.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|This writer has a talent for unlocking the readers imagination with her words.  I lost all sense of time when reading this book.  It was wonderful.
B00006674X|4.0|We have not yet tried out this movie but it appears to be in very good condition and it came quickly in the mail.  We have no reason to think it might be a bad product.  So far we are pleased

B007URVZJ6|3.0|I'm new to writing for Kindle. It's a special format. You just can't save something in Word and expect the format to transfer exactly the way you see it. This book points you in the right direction if you have nothing else to work with. You might find this web page a little more helpful: [...]
B0084B5TK8|4.0|It was a great book to read and I will have to read It again<br />And again my brother should read it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this one better than the first one. I think the graphics are better.it is an addictive game and i can play it for hours!
B005LAII1C|5.0|I saw this film in theaters, and enjoyed it very much. The blu-ray comes with an assortment of entertaining special features too.  Family Guy fans will deffinately enjoy it, and even some people who aren't might enjoy it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Bared to you seemed like a cheap version of Fifty Shades of Grey, that is why I was reluctant to start the SECOND book at first, but needless to say it drew me in like quick sand. I LOVED IT! It started to stray away from the whole \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" theme and went into something a little darker-and I LOVED IT! I had to admit, I was a little pissed at first, because Eva and Gideon were solving their relationship problems....WITH SEX! They would get into this HUGE argument and end up making up with hot sex. I would be so frustrated sometimes, I'd just skip the sex and move on to the part where they start talking. One thing I CANNOT stand about Romance Novels are the submissive-passive-spineless heroines. They let the guy walk all over them...NO! I do NOT like that. Back to the book, Eva was a bit submissive and passive, especially during sex and it made me mad. He would do something wrong and they'd get into a fight and then he kisses her and they end up having sex. She forgets about it and all is well. This message tells men \\"Yes, if you two get into a heated argument, make it up to her by having mind-blowing sex and you'll both win. She's happy and you win the argument.\\"<br />BUT! I APPLAUD EVA (Stands up and claps loudly) for developing a bitch behavior during the middle towards the end! I LOVED THAT! I mean really how many times do you see the heroine flicking off the guy? HAHA! HELL YEAH! That's what I would do, especially if the jerk's cheating. Every time I read the part where Eva flicks off Gideon, I highlight the scene in my kindle, place it down on the table, stand up and give her a round of applause. Award for the best Heroine of the season! But I have to admit, that Gideon does redeem himself in the end, which is why I can't wait for the next book in June.<br /><br />*Highly recommend this one*
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the first things I Bought on Amazon and I Dont regret it came in the mail with my other movies and was in great conditon....Now My Collection Is complete and for a great price
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If I could give Downton Abbey eleventy stars, I would. This show is as beautifully dense as a Tolstoy epic.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This was a great Movie needed it to complete my Marvel Phase 1 Collection and new was very high Priced was delivered quickly and was in great condition! Thank You
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't normally read this type of story but my daughter wanted me to watch the movie with her.  Then I just had to read the book.  I couldn't put it down and when I finished it was great to see that the story continues.

B009G78EE2|5.0|I bought this album specifically for \\"Thrift Shop\\", but I'm now a huge fan of Mackelmore. He's got a different message than most, and its refreshing to hear.
B008AX18Y6|3.0|I am an admirer and supporter of Mr. Rushdie. I have read all his books, with a few exceptions. I did read the Satanic Verses as it came out.<br />It is a fascinting story in itself . Years of living In hiding, being denied normal human contact etc.<br />But, his writing in the first person does not work . It is not well defined. Often he refers to &#34;he&#34;, meaning himself, but it appeared that it might refer to the person with whom he was at the time.<br />Nonetheless , a gripping story.<br />G.Ashkenazy
0547884591|5.0|Very cool book.  Got one for me and my sister.  Laid out with easy to follow instructions and vivid pictures. I'm a big Tim Ferriss fan and this book does not disappoint.  I have also really enjoyed the Meta-Learning section.  Gave to my sister for her bday and she loved it.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I agree with many Arthur C. Clarke fans. It's the best thing he ever wrote. Even better than 2001? Even better than Rendezvous with Rama? Yes and yes.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Everything you would expect from MUSE.  Great lyrics, emotional music and lots of energy.  I could have lived without the F*** bomb getting dropped in one of their songs, but other than that -GREAT Album.
B006CQLGXG|4.0|Why not opt for the beatuifully-illustrated (and free) version of this holiday classic? It's amazing how faithful movies and plays are to Dickens's original tale, disloyal and all.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This arrived in perfect condition, with the CD and album booklet intact. The album itself is very good, filled with a diverse range of great songs. Definitely recommend!
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|You will always be very pleased with James Taylor music!<br />I believe I have most all of his cassettes and/or CDs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love online  and survival creating stuff is better I love the graphics I downloaded it yesterday love love love
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Always pushing comic social commentary just over the line (or well past it), Ted does not disappoint. If you are secretly harbor a wicked raunchy streak, this is an awesome flick.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun to play. I have always wanted a horse this game is awesome aswesome awsesome. if you like horses this is your game
B007FH9GA6|4.0|Roony Mara was superb! When she was onscreen, you noticed no one else. Daniel Craig is so much better as Mikael Blomkvist than as James Bond. He was perfect. The story seemed a little choppy at times, the way it see-sawed back & forth. Could have flowed better, but I liked it. While I understand the sexual violence was necessary to the plot & story, it was overdone. The director must have been trying to shock us, but remember nothing shocks viewers these days!<br />We can certainly get the picture without having to actually see every gory detail!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Very cute movie not for kids.  Very funny. I like to see a sequel.mgood idea I regimens to all.thar are adults sec and a lot of derringer.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Delivered on time and well wrapped<br />Fantastic concert for all music fans<br />Star studded event with some great performances.<br />This is a must own for all Pop music fans of the last 30 years.<br />It's amazing how many pop icons David Foster has produced and the title Hit Man is about right<br />You won't be sorry if you purchase this Blu Ray as the sound and picture quality are both superb<br />Enjoy
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Shoes the problems of pullets today.  I didn't care for the outcome..  Densely Washington did a great job.  I hope he does a better film next time.

B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter I love tweeting with everyone.  Wish they would answer me back.  Not nice of them to not reply. I will continue. Continue to write to people and give my opinion's.
B001UHOWXI|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of this Blu-ray &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34;.  To me, it wasn't any better than the regular DVD version.
0688171664|5.0|I loved this book when I read it many years ago, and enjoy it just as much every time I reread it.  It is refreshingly candid and thought-provoking.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series is one of the best that I have seen in a long time. The acting is superb. I would recommend this series to everyone. I love period pieces. It is amazing to see the times changing for the aristocrats and the working class. A must see for all.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|I thought this book was good. It had a great premise. I had a problem with how the author named things, though. It felt like he always just added -ies to the end of every group of people. Rusties. Smokies. Uglies. Pretties. Even Littlies? Its a good book, maybe a little predictable, once you get past the names.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Dark Shadows is based upon an older TV series from the 70s, and tells the story of a young American &#34;noble&#34; in the 1700s who is cursed to be a vampire and locked away for over 200 years. Upon awaking he is in a land he does not recognize and his family has fallen into poverty. He must raise them from their low position back to greatness and deal with the &#34;witch&#34; who cursed him so long ago...<br /><br />Needless to say the premise for the story line is not that complicated and should have been a simple matter of translation to script and screen... Unfortunately that above summary fails to communicate the complexity that was involved in the classic Dark Shadows TV series, and instead of streamlining and attempting to keep the story in check due to only have 2 hours or so of film (see above summary), the writers and director decided to wast our time with hanging plot hooks that turn into confusing holes, characters that have no purpose, strange transformations never hinted at nor mentioned ever until the final act, and superfluous innuendo`s of sexual encounter that do nothing to further the plot nor develop characterization.<br />I normally love Tim Burton, and here his ascetic is clear to see, but his ability to weave a script into film falls apart greatly! Johnny Depp is in top form however as is most of the cast, although I felt the witch and daughter could have been a bit less &#34;Dramatic&#34;. If you have to watch every Tim Burton film, then go ahead, but I would wait for its inevitable slip to Amazon Prime or Netflix before you pay 3.99 for something not worth the .99 cents.
159420411X|5.0|I work as a data analyst, and reading how Nate has approached problems as diverse as baseball, poker, elections - really gave me fresh ideas that I can apply to my own work. I did feel at first that the first half of the book dragged on a bit, but understanding his examples in detail did help me understand the context behind his recommendations in the second half of the book. The book could have been shorter, but I would have missed a few insights that the longer narrative provided. I am eager to find applications of Bayesian analysis in my own work, and I anticipate turning back to this book in the future to help shape my approach.
0618918248|5.0|A great book for anyone who has heard the common arguments from ignorance that religious people use and want to understand why they are wrong.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Because this item is what I needed for my Ipad, transferring pictures from my camera to the iPad is so much simplier
B005H9B44A|5.0|Thor was a good action movie with lots of fancy graphics.  This movie doesn't have a storyline whatsoever but doesn't need one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As I've written about the first two seasons, this is outstanding stuff particularly if you like British acting.  It is accurately portrayed by the skillful thespians to represent the period following WWI where the long-entrenched aristocracy must either make their inheritances self-sustaining or face the unsavory dissolution of what has been long enjoyed.  What's special about this series is that we are equally if not more interested in the goings on of the service personnel who have their own intrigues and relationships in their private world.  Very entertaining stuff, great lines and deliveries thereof, and great sets and scenery.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was one of those stories that had me reading late into the night. I couldn't put it down.<br />In typical Jodi Picoult style, the story moves through time not in linear fashion, but in past and present<br />woven together to create a suspenseful and unpredictable plot.<br />  One of the things I liked most about the novel is that it involves courtroom litigation. I enjoy<br />the dance of prosecutor vs. defense attorney. As always in our legal system, it is not so much a matter<br />of guilt or innocence, but of reasonable doubt. The fact that it is a likeable young man whose fate is at stake makes it all the more compelling.<br />  I read this book on my Kindle. As much as I love my Kindle, I wish I had the book in my hands so that I could have easily gone back to previous pages. As the story unfolds, the meanings of passages written in previous chapters spring to life.<br />  I am currently reading Salem Falls, another novel by this same author. So far, another page turner!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Such a consummate actor that Danzel Washington.  Exiting the heart-throb years as he now has, he is entering a different, deeper character development side of his acting ability.  In this interesting and deeply felt story that opens with the first 15 minutes or so of high drama, the story of addiction and the struggle to overcome it is once again the main plot.  It's directed and acted poignantly and realistically, and should be heeded by all of us who know someone or are, in fact, someone who needs to find a way to get their life back from the very difficult attachment to mind-altering substances.<br /><br />(Sexist remark alert !!)  :)<br /><br />From a guy's point of view, the opening scenes of his flight attendant/girlfriend awakening and rising for the day are worth the price of admission alone.  WOW!
0307887898|5.0|great book for the entreprenuer in us all.  Guides you through The Lean Startup process, but reaches into any subject matter imaginable.  Great experience with the buying process.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Didn't care at all for this, hurts to turn the page but yet I continue to, rambling of dysfunction.<br /><br />Finally listened to my inner self and put the book down. What a waste of time I'll never get back.
B004ECDNJU|2.0|This game had great graphics and music, but it bored me a little bit. I thought it was cool at first, but after playing a few times, the novelty wore off. I deleted it after about a week. I didn't play it that much.<br /><br />If this is your thing, try it out. This is only my opinion.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I always like Denzel Washington movies. This was no exception. Good storyline. A little slow at times but keep my interest.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I have the first Temple Run and love it. I was excited for the second one to come out. When I finally did I Dow loaded it and played it. I liked it. I went to play it again but it wouldn't open. it is so stupid. they really need to fix it. This happened to most of my friends to.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I've been a sort of Scott Bakula fan for a while, but this roole fits him like a glove. Bravo!
B008L1DNGI|4.0|it is a classic little adventure game, very simple controls and very simple gameplay. if you want a throwback and enjoyed the origional then you will enjoy this
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is soooo fun. Though its highly adickting. First i thought it was dumb.then my friend showed me tje game and told me to get it. Now im rating it 5-star.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this is a very origional app, quite fun and exciting you use the tools of a magic marker to create yourself and in your adventure all the tools are your own making, it is a great way to pass the time on long drives (if not driving) or plane trips.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|the whole thing revolves around responding to a exposure of something inside Bond's organization to a threat<br />including what appears to be a identified breach and refitting of a best agent into a re-assignment leading to confronting a rather personal and obscure retribution based on a unpalatable reason<br />Very unlike any Bond flick we've seen in the past.  No stand-out acting. Actions well done but not outstanding w/r to the likes of &#34;Mission Impossible&#34; ; e.g. Bond like actions whose intensity is mostly worth watching for the first 8mn
B003G4W49C|5.0|Everyone read it immediately! This book is amazing, the protagonist will inspire you even when you loose a little hope in him. It's great.
0062206281|5.0|The Prisoner of Heaven: A Novel is a delight to read--complicated but clear storyline and very well written.  Strong characters.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was interesting, funny and so very entertaining.  Everyone should read it and purchase other books by this author. I know I intend to do so
B008ER9QLK|5.0|This production is one that will take your breath away. The controversial technicality of the staging paid off and then some, and the singing is some of the best I've heard. I have to say that Deborah Voight as Brunhilde was, to my ear, past her prime, though as an actress she looked and performed fantastically. Bryn Tervel is a terrific Wotan, and the rest of the cast are simple superlative. You have to see this production to believe it. It's incredible.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Addiction made..I had played the game a long time ago. Recently that it back. Must say I easily feel in love with it again
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I would rather watch a rerun of Dance Moms than this horrible story.  Movie is fun all the way until the 2nd act and then it goes tits up from there and turns into a weird version of \\"Signs\\" and \\"Chronicle\\".
0670026603|5.0|Enjoyed this story from beginning to end, shows how people can and do adapt to others thoughts, wishes and prayers even tho they differ from their own.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever loved someone enough to let them do what is best for them and not concern for themselves.
0061438294|4.0|I wasn't sure whether to give it three stars or four, but I guess I'll be generous. I borrowed this book from the library and read it to learn specific examples of body language and the messages they tend to send for use in drawing.<br /><br />Things I like: research cited; good amount of quality pictures; mentioning the importance of establishing context for every individual and situation and establishing patterns of behavior; dispelling the idea that there are any surefire lie detecting tells.<br /><br />I am skeptical or bemused by some of the examples provided regarding legs and feet, particularly, the examples of leg crossing behaviors and what direction one's feet are pointed say. I don't think I ever really see anybody standing with crossed legs, without leaning against something, as is shown as a sign of high comfort. Honestly, it seems quite awkward to me. And I regularly stand with my feet in an L formation while conversing with individuals, with no intention of leaving or wishes of being somewhere else, which goes against what Navarro says regarding this stance; I doubt I'm the only one who does this, but maybe I'm wrong. Either he's wrong on this point, or my body is damn dirty liar.<br /><br />So, what I'm saying is I mostly liked this book, having only some minor quibbles with it. That said, it wasn't so great that I bought it after borrowing it from the library. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Per the mention of another reviewer, I'm going to check out \\"The Definitive Book of Body Language\\" sometime in the future, and if I should happen to remember, I will edit this review afterward.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a great GAME I LOVED THIS GAME I would take it a lot. Of PLACE'S :)(: IT'S A GREAT GREAT GAME
B008D19WBQ|1.0|Extremely poor quality, not meeting Blu Ray resolution at all.<br />When you pause, you may see noise that is worse as DVD quality has.<br />Picture quality changes from episodes or scene to scene.<br />For example when chandler stuck in bank ATM branch, my cell phone does better job filming then that “Blu Ray”.<br />When Friend went to hockey play, you are basically see worse TV version instead movie play, and so on.<br />I think that version been made just to feed market request for Friends Blu Ray, but no remastering work been done at all.<br />If you have DVD version don’t waste your money on it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love the game, but it would be much easie on the elbows and shoulders if you could tap on the numbers and they would go where they belong as in other games I play.  They might not end up where I want them all the time, but most of the time it works.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Fringe is afflicting!  I can't stop watching and thanks to Amazon Instant Video, I don't have to.  Definitely a show worth watching.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love that the fact that the numbers move when you tap them, and don't need to be dragged into place.  Makes for a lot less pain in the wrists, elbows, and shoulders.  Thanks.
B0094K1MH2|1.0|This was poor animation with caricature characters and the misleading title.  Tintin is the guy not the dog and this is not about a dog.  The dog has a very small role.
0767817478|5.0|great great great great great movie of all times besides King Kong ! i collect all the classics its worth it
B00062J00S|5.0|i received the movie in a timely fashion. I cry every time I see it. I will recommend, and order again.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Intense and interesting for the first hour or so then it evolved into preachiness about alcohol abuse. Too heavy handed.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|this is classic Tintin and certainly worth watching especially since it's free with Prime. It's a cartoon but it's an adult movie with crime fighting, alcohol, guns, etc.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This story and presentation are lovely.<br />The filming and music are inspiring and beautiful.<br />The actors give a great performance.
0316044695|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in modern warfare. First time I have ever teared up from a book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Normally, I read the book before I watch a series.  This time, however, I reversed the order because I didn't have time to read the book prior to watching the series.  The book has multiple plots that really pull you in.  It is easy to see why the series was easily put together and followed the book very closely.  Still a great read even after watching the series.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|First in the series - but it starts strongly.  Improved with the second reading.  Basically it feels like an action movie on the page - so suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride.
B000A0K2JO|1.0|This didn't work for plugging my DELL USB keyboard into a TRENDnet TK-205 KVM switch, nor even  directly into the PS/2 connector of my DELL Vostro (Windows 7) or older Optiplex (Windows 2000).  All this equipment works in other configurations.  I have a similar-looking USB to PS/2 mouse adapter by Microsoft that works fine.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love this game! A friend told me about it a few times and after a year or two I finally bight it. This game has introduced me to a whole new type of games. It's totally worth it. Buy it now.
B0095VP8D4|3.0|The A-10 5800K appeared to be the newest hottest thing out by AMD.  I bought one as I liked the integrated graphics and the possibility of putting 2 more graphics cards in SLI formation along with this integrated card within the processor.  The integrated graphics is a HD7660 format with 512MB of DDR2 memory.  It's by no means a smoker.  After I got the drivers installed and got it all going I noticed some jerking going on in the graphics response.  This was during typical DVD video viewing.  The processor portion is doing it's job but the graphics is just throwing anchors all over the computer.  If you intend on buying one of these processors, do it with the intention of getting a graphics card that will shoot a little smoke.  The integrated graphics is a dog from the word go. The software that accompanies the motherboard and the processor help to adjust the performance but you can only squeeze so much out.  Get an extra graphics card if you get this processor.<br />UPDATE: Not 3 months after the purchase of this item I was trying to find out why I was getting no picture on my screen.  Turned out this processor is also a power hog and if it doesn't have sufficient power the customer will be buying a replacement processor.  This baby has to be configured from the very beginning to be the stand-a-lone graphics, Once you build the system.  DO NOT try to add other graphics cards without totally setting your BIOS switches appropriately and making sure you put an external on before building the configuration of the software. Only then will the embedded graphics be friendly to a PCIE card and synchronize with it.  Once they play together you will have a never ending supply of wonderment on the screen.  Just watch how you build it.  All in all I still give it a 3 Stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down, had to buy the 2nd one right away because I couldn't wait for a copy to become available from the library. Yes it is intense and graphic, but it is all about their love story.
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|The only movie I know of with with a soundtrack by Donovan (of &#34;Season of the Witch, Sunshine Superman&#34; and other hits of the seventies).<br />From the star hanging himself in the opening scene, and laughing about it, and all of the 'dating' scenes, to when Harold met Maude in the car she had just stolen, to their bedroom scenes, this movie takes turns you would never dream of.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, you've never seen a movie like it.<br /><br />Car enthusiasts may be amazed at what can be done to expensive cars using cheap car parts.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|Insightful, quirky, and just a bit different. A book and characters to fall in love with. I just loved it!
B004A2V3K0|5.0|Every song on this ablum is great if you have ever seen him in concert you will love this awesome greatest hits addition.<br />I would give it a ten five stars just isn't enough.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thought I knew exactly where this was headed and then realized I was only half way through the book. Don't want to reveal much, but my only complaint was that she was just a little too premeditated.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Great storyline... great beginning... ending got kind of uninteresting and predictable and really the dialgue lost out too.  Fizzled!  Sorry!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great to spend time with.  starts out easy and then gets harder the more levels you advance with.<br /><br />lots of fun.<br />-
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The movies are always good ofcourse.  However, it took me 45 minutes to rent the movie because of a purchasing error.  Your tech team was able to help... still, that's too long for a Friday night movie!
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This book is efficient, funny, and encouraging.<br /><br />Thirteen more words are required for me to be finished with this review.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Love this series and the movie does not disappoint. If you love these ladies, get the movie!! The second one is fantastic as well!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is a fascinating series in very much in the spirit of the original Doctor Who adventures.  Christopher Eccleston is the perfect actor to portray the latest incarnation of The Doctor.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I got this for my son and its a really good movie!! Wonderful color and picture animation and the story was received well.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|I'm not exactly sure where to even begin. This movie is bad, like made for tv bad. I didn't see it in 3d so I am assuming that the majority of the visual issues are because of that. The lighting is horrible, the first movie had a good balance of what to show and what to leave to the imagination. Revelations doesn't do this, everything is seen in bright and terrible detail. I was tempted to turn the brightness down on my TV to help the movie but it wasn't worth the effort. I'm not sure how you mess up fog, but using CG for some of it is certainly a good start. I have to question where the budget went for this movie but it sure wasn't in the special effects. It also wasn't in the locations which went from bad to worse. I hate to re-iterate myself but this movie is a small step up from the garbage the Syfy channel now produces. Now for the acting. I feel bad for all the actors in here since they were all trapped in this terrible script. Sean Bean tried, you can tell, but he is trapped in this movie which his ironic. This movie suffers from not knowing what it wants to be, a teenage slasher flick, an occult movie, something with a plot. I didn't listen to any interviews but I'm sure the canned response went something like \\"we are such huge fans of the game, blah blah blah\\".  Now they absolutely cherry picked the third game and succeeded in making everything terrible. The rabbits (if you played the game you know) were not scary and they could have been. Locations like the mall, the school, etc. All wasted opportunities. Instead we got some forced love interest. Pyramid head, while having no place in the first movie I thought still worked as fan service because he wasn't over used. He absolutely doesn't need to be in Revelations. I almost shudder to think if they keep making these movies, it will follow the footsteps of the Resident Evil movies.
B000683VI4|5.0|I think every woman can relate that this movie is the best love story next to Titanic!! And the actors are great!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have had this app on my phone for years on really like it.  So, when I needed a document app on my Kindle Fire, I chose this one.  It is great for when I need to create a &#34;To DO&#34; list!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is a romantic comedy with two of my favorites!! Cute movie and its really funny!! Plus Betty White is in it! Can't get much better than her lol
B001UTW7QU|5.0|There isn't anything bad to say.  This show is fantastic!  I look forward to rewatching the seasons with my Prime membership!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie, has good effect, sound, and suspence.  Recomend for Si-Fi veiwers of all ages: sit back, turn up the volumn and relax for the adventure
B000MQC9H4|5.0|this is a good date movie, try not to skimp on the pampering fellas. this one is perfect for her.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Diffrent from all other Si-Fi.  What's with a six shooter pistols in the future??  Good action, suspence, story is written well in all episodes.  Recommed this series for Si-fi viewers
B000002GVZ|5.0|Great cd, all her best hits are on it. I highly recommend it to other fans of hers. Also to others looking to try her music.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Not bad.... Space ship jumping on water was a little hard to believe but it had good effect and a lot of action.  The Battleship Missouri taking out the mothership was impressive.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Very similar to the first book with more elaborate traps and scenarios in the next hunger games. Lots of plot development and uncertainty, which I like, but leaves something to be desired.
B001KOFH2G|4.0|follows along with the series, sums everything up, from the series, and delivers action packed adventure most si-fi movies fall short on.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was wonderful and touching, much more so than the movie made this storyline seem. It is easy to become engrossed in the story and when it ends, you almost have to immediately start the next.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If asked to describe this book in one word it word be this: beautiful. I've read countless books and I've fallen in love with many of them... and yet I've never closed a back cover, and with tears still in my eyes said, \\"Wow. That was beautiful\\" until this book. This book moved me. I am not one to cry a lot.... which explains why I have only cared to read one Nicholas Sparks novel. Who the hell feels like sitting around crying all day anyway? Not me. I dove into this book not knowing what to expect. I cried. A lot. And honestly, I am Ok with that. It was OK to cry for the girl, for the boy, for their lives and the lives of those around them. They deserved to be cried for. I've never felt my heart being ripped out and yet being made whole all at once before. I've not experienced or read about such pain, such strength, such courage, and unconditional love before. Colleen Hoover, you have made yet another fan. The words, the story, every little thing was just simply amazing. This book is heavy. But please do not let that keep you from opening it up. I promise it'll grab your soul and you will never be the same when you close it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Once you are this far into it, you might as well finish the series off. I did not like the ending well at all, but I suppose it was right for the series. Still fairly well written but just about as disappointing as the fifth Harry potter book or the final twilight book. The main character tanks, but by then you care so much about everyone else, you have to see what happens.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|To me this was a bittersweet story and also a story of unconditional love.  At times heartbreaking but uplifting in the end.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|Movie moved a little slow at times but overall it was entertaining and held my interest.  Not a cinematic masterpiece and I wasn't a huge fan of the way the ending was structured but worth a watch.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. I liked the story and the characters.  The main character was intriging, tenacious, resourceful and pitiable and also tragic.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Enjoyable, but not as engaging as the previous books in this series.  Are Preston and Childs tiring of Agent P?
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I have been listening to the entire album non-stop since I bought it a week ago. It is that GOOD!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very well written.  I was engaged right from page 1.  Highly recommend the book to anyone over the age of 16.
B00138J2MA|5.0|It was one of my first albums in my teen years. It definitely brings back good memories. Great album Sade.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Slow, long looks, and lots of scenary shots (some are very nice). Its a typical comedy of errors and I'll admit I laughed, a little. But I really don't get Wes Anderson, I saw The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, in the theaters and swore never to make that mistake again. I watched this on Amazon thankfully. I'm a huge fan of movies and really wish I understood where Wes is coming from! But I can only appreciate bit and pieces, but not the product as a whole.
0385344333|5.0|As long as you can forget all about Tom Cruise, you can continue to enjoy the Jack Reacher novels.  Somebody should tell TC that he's not tall, strong, or handsome! What a shame that he is the face of Jack Reacher.  No wonder the movie bombed, could have been an ongoing series.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Really enjoyed the authentic accents, storytelling, and adventure. You gotta love the strong female led in children stories!! So over the damsel in distress.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|There is nothing I dislike about this product. Andrea Bocelli is amazing and so is the pianist!  You can't go wrong buying this.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I downloaded this when it was the free app of the day.  My boyfriend watched me play it and we were both so enamored of it that he bought it.  It is well worth $0.99 and I would even pay more for it (though it's still nice to have gotten it for free!).<br /><br />The premise is simple: Moonboy is sleepwalking and you adjust things in his path to get him safely back to his bed.  It starts off easy and as you go on more things get added into the gameplay.  So far, my favorite things are the tightropes and the unicycles.<br /><br />The graphics are gorgeous and the music compliments it perfectly.  I have it on my Kindle Fire HD and it is really stunning.  We thought it would be harder to play on the smaller screen of a phone, but that is how my boyfriend plays it and he has no problems.<br /><br />I give this game five stars and two thumbs up!
B002N9MK8G|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy listening to this cd. The song list is great, and the part where he talks to the audience at the Sands is a nice look at Sinatra the man. Great orchestra.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|like the game for my 3 year old simple and make her laugh but my issue is that she can and has ordered stupid coins that cost me $10 . what the hell wish they would stop the ability of unwanted perches.<br />i gave then ok points due to that fact alone toddlers easy ability to buy unwanted coins.<br /> upset that i am out $10 i think i will remove the app for that reason its too bad it was a fun game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This cool game makes me feel like I actual own a house . It is very realistic, I love it
B008FYZIVY|4.0|Love the period of time with all the happenings of the Abbey. I love the Characters, each one unique and special.
B00B2QA9TI|2.0|The over stylizing of the movie detracted from the story and the depth of character development. It felt like a musical.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I love a great sports movie, but this wasn't what I thought it would be. It was ok, but not one I'd watch again or recommend to my friends who like the same kind of sports movies I do. It was ok, but I wanted to cheer from my couch and I didn't feel the need.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I heard so many great reviews of this show, but was still hesitant whether I would like it or not.  So glad I threw all inhibitions out the window and just watched it!!!  Seriously phenominal show!!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I don't see the point of this movie - not funny, unless you like puke. The talent wasn't really there, so what was the message and point of the movie?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked it a lot... just was a little different in places compared to the book!<br />My friends liked it too!
B008FOB124|4.0|DCD is one of those groups that you either like or don't.  I've been a fan for many years after hearing Black Sun. I've seen Brendan Perry & Lisa Gerrard on their own & understand now how their collaboration works. The thing about the music is that it is often dark & moody but also majestic & powerful. Read the lyrics & you find gems of intelligent thought. JJ
B009UX2YAC|2.0|stupid game because at first it was so fun but then it updated to Rio then when I got on it it had got rid of all my money and I was saving up on it too and before I had $28,000 and that made me so mad it also got rid of all my characters I bought I WAS SO MAD don't get this game
B007BVT5N4|5.0|The book helped to see life from Justin's perspective. Recommended for all you Beliebers.<br />Enjoy as much as I did!
0316044695|2.0|Bought this book thinking it would read like Bowden's Black Hawk Down.  Mistaken.  Luttrell writes like he's in high school and can't stop talken about himself as a high-speed Operator stud.  What happened to the &#34;quite professional&#34;.  I barely got through it, but had to skip past all the SEAL training and other garbage.  Disappointing.
B00005JSGK|4.0|John Wayne, what can you say? And it is helping me complete my John Wayne llibrary of all his movies!<br /><br />Ok but I'm not into this way of life or what it represented.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This take on the Batman series is one of my personal favorites. I would recommend any fan of the franchise to check out this movie and the the comic.
B00008CMR6|4.0|John Wayne, what can you say? And it is helping me complete my John Wayne llibrary of all his movies!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|To watch a season in one sitting...so much easier to know &#34;what's going on!&#34; commercial free. . . . .
6305754969|5.0|John Wayne, what can you say? And it is helping me complete my John Wayne llibrary of all his movies!<br /><br />Once again good supporting actors.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this App so convenient just search an interest and bam the best just pick and make it a reality.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Once I figured out how to play it, it was challengeing.  It is very entertaining.  Can't put the kindle down
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This movie was mediocre, I lost interest about halfway though it and I guess that's about it. Be nice to a truck driver today, we keep America moving.
B005ETA5K2|2.0|This product did not work on my Mac. It took HOURS to find software that would make it work. After I did that it still sucked. It did not make my internet go any faster even though the program told me it was fully connected and helping my speed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I use this app a lot on both my Android phone and on my Kindle Fire HD. The fact that it can recognize FTP and windows shares over the wireless network is way awesome. I use it to back my SD card files onto a network share, copy media files over the network to my tablet and phone, and all sorts of file related tasks.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart and Christmas music, how can you go wrong?  He's becoming quite adept at handling classics and I enjoy him more now than I did when we (Rod and myself) were younger.
B009T3AHDE|5.0|I was so excited to buy the movie as it did not play in our local movie theater.  I loved the move and found Mr. Pattinson's acting wonderful.
B000BCE918|5.0|Just watch it and enjoy this movie. It's a classic movie that you will always enjoy. Never seems to get old.
B006P96PAO|5.0|This is a terrific movie for the whole family to watch together, especially with Dad. It was an eye opener for me to realize how important a man's role is as husband and father in the family. Good acting and direction. Has everything a good picture should and carries the viewer through a full range of emotions. Plenty of action and drama. No profanity, No sex. Can't usually find a movie these days without all that and I thank the producers for this movie and congratulate them for this true to life story. I would also like to recommend the musical soundtrack for this movie, it is very inspirational. Courageous by Casting Crowns.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Well, where to begin. I love zombie flicks, Simon Pegg is a great actor in comedies or more serious roles so, naturally, this was a good movie.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I'm kind of addicted to Nancy Meyer movies, whether they're great or not. The settings, the strong women, the lovely homes ... you get the idea. This is one of those kind of movies that you can relax with over and over again. Good characters, no plot holes, actors looking like they are enjoying their roles. For the type of movie it is, very well done; glad I own it!
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Always a classic..has always kept me watching and Im glad I found them when i did. They should make a new one.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I liked it because of how it described the recovery of humanity after a disaster through different individual perspectives. Awesome book
B000001FN3|5.0|Even though I purschased the 1987 version, I am very pleased with Alan Parsons, minimalist tweaking of the original album.  I'm glad that Orson Wells narration was finally added.  Listening to this album, I feel similar to how I feel when I listen to Al Stwart.  These records take me on a journey beyond space and time.  I also like the soundtrack for the series Cosmos as well.  This music is timeless.  I wish more of todays budding musicians and singers would listen to the &#34;older stuff&#34;.  They could learn alot from the masters.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Some of the stuff in the book I thought would be a reiteration of common sense knowledge until I started paying attention to what some of the others at the gym do.  I even caught myself falling into some of the traps that the book talks about like working out to long and not heavy enough.  My problem is I go to the gym for me time, I'm married with 3 kids, but at the same time I want results.  I don't really socialize at the gym but I do get into a trance a lot and don't focus on what I am doing.  This last week I implemented some of the strategies in the book and my gym experience was much more enjoyable without spending an abundant amount of time there.  My joints weren't as sore and I feel like I recovered a lot better and faster.  I still can't wrap my head around the number of sets and amount of time between them, but I did do half my usual sets and reps and felt great afterwords.  Thank you Mike for making me realize my fitness errors and getting me to correct them.  Your book was very refreshing and an entertaining read.
B00A757EFW|4.0|It is a fun game and also a good way to kill time. It  Reminds me of the old game.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Despite some obvious omissions of logic, purely entertaining Bond. Hope Daniel Craig stays around for a few more. Looking forward to the next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is so cool.I thought it would be plain and very similar to the other temple run.Temple run is awesome
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have always loved everything I have read by Mr. King.  I have spent many enjoyable hours with his books.
B004L07KWQ|2.0|It wasn't very creative .I was very plain . There wasn't very much to play or do.That is why I do not like this game.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down and found myself thinking what a socialistic world people wanted back in those days.  Ayn Rand, herself had leanings in that direction.....I had a little trouble thinking about the protaginests.  Not really believeable in some parts.Just a powerful read...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a wonderful program full of great acting and intrigue. Even my husband enjoys the show. Absolutely fun to watch.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great game with intuitive controls and fluid gameplay! I love and hate the attack mode at the same time!!  Does not adhere to mahjjong rules, in that  the piece you remove does not have to have at least one side exposed; as long as you match the pair, the pieces can lie anywhere within the cube. This is a terrific game!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is amazing I love it. I use it daily this app was a blessing and a relief. Thank you to the developers.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Easy app ...downloads right away works great on my Kindle fire HD...<br />gives you several different options on how many pieces the pizzle has. Wich makes is harder or easyer.<br />Great app to have on road trips or on rainny days camping...
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I loved it.<br />I have no more to say. This music is beautiful, classical, and highly emotional. This fits perfectly the movie. If you liked the movie - you'll love it.<br />And if you haven't seen the movie yet - don't wait. Just do it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love temple run. I get addicted to playing it frequently. Its so simple, just run, turn, slide etc, but it gets harder and harder the farther you go. Its awesome to see your scores nationally and try to get to the top!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love it!! The soundtrack is so beautifully done, it makes me believe that I'm in the cinema watching the performance again. Very well done!
B00683JK9K|4.0|Love how you can change the difficulty, with 4 different levels within every puzzle. Some are very challenging, and others my daughter (4) can play. Great game for those who love puzzles.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is not bad, but seems almost too easy.  It's basically Mahjongg, but you have to rotate the cube to find the matches.  Nice game to play to pass the time when you're waiting at the doctor's office or on the train - doesn't need a whole lot of concentration.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well this game is fun but I think you should give us more days to get new characters and bordes thank you
B008QTVNUI|5.0|couldn't stop watching.  great series that has many twists and turns.  Can't wait for season 2 to be released.<br />worth watching
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games i have ever played at first i thought that it was going to be a rele rele stupid game but no i was wrong this is probably one of the most fun and addicting games  in the world pls get it to me its a must get
B00899F0G8|5.0|I have watched this show since the beginning & never been disappointed in an episode yet.  Only thing I wish for is that there was more Holly Marie Combs :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks never disappoints his readers.  This one has the character development and suspense needed to hold your attention.  The twist at the end is masterful!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I usually love Nicholas Sparks and when I saw a movie coming out I had to read the book first. Not much substance in this one. Maybe I am expecting too much, but his books are beginning to sound all alike to me.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS APP!!!!  It ruined my kindle fire and now I can't watch YouTube videos altogether! Even on the internet!!!! I'd sue if I could!!! Save  yourself!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is challenging and fun at the same time. Test your eyes, and your eye-hand coordination. Great for killing time in a waiting room, or competing with the kids. Love this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the endless twists and turns in this game and the game is 10 times better than temple run 1 &amp;2 super addicted  to this game play all the time BUY THIS APP!!!!!!
B006G2124E|5.0|The book was great and this was one of those rare movies that didn't disappoint compared to the book, the casting was great although the physical appearances were not consistent with the book descriptions.
1451629184|5.0|book was soooo cheap and in excellent condition. iwas quiet impressed.! i have recommended this website.havent finished the book yet.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I had the original cassette of this and then the CD when that came out, but I lost it.  Recently I saw a PBS special about the re-uniting of Paul Simon with the South African musicians and I had to buy it again.  I always loved Paul Simon from 1969 with Art Garfunkle, but now I realize what a talented musical genius he is, and this will always be part of my musical staples.  The music is timeless and smart, and stays with you.  The combination of Simon's music and especially the accordian, drums, horns, and the So. African vocals are so different and still fresh.  Diamonds on the &#34;Souls of her Shoes&#34; is my favorite, but every cut stands the test of time.  And now I go around responding to people with, &#34;Who am I to blow against the wind?!&#34;  Buy it again.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Maybe i'm just a girl who needs more substance... but this game gets boring after about 20 minutes. I played both modes, and the attack mode is the only thing that gets me going. Though if you like games that are simple and colorful, this is the game for you. I was lucky to receive this as a free app in the Gold Deals, so I really have no regrets getting this since I didn't have anything to loose.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|I bought this thinking I needed a little Christmas mood music, but I got a lot more than that.  My new favorite song &#34;River&#34; and a cut with Yo Yo Ma accompanying James on &#34;Here Comes the Sun&#34;.  Beautiful arrangements!  I've been playing these two songs way past Dec.25.  Now I'm sure that I'll jump-start my Christmas season with this CD starting in Nov.next year.  I'm even going to buy another one of this in case it gets scratched or broken.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This edition of Angry Birds seems to have lots of ads, but is also extremely difficult to get more than 2 stars for most of the games.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Anyone reading my reviews might think, she like every book she reads and they probably are right.  I choose my books seriously.  The heroine in Murder didn't take the murder of her sister.  She is relentless in her pursuit of the killer.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put it down!!<br />It was truly a wonderful book can't wait to see the movie loved it all
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so addictive and is such fun. Also it is very easy to get the hang of it and is a family friendly game great for all ages. Definitely 5 star
B008ASGP3U|5.0|After reading this book, as I often do with an author I like, I bought all his books.  Rebus is a very interesting character - with the realistic frailties of man - and the author provides a provocative geographic and political context for his stories.  I've read two now and they were entertaining and enlightening reading.  My wife thought it was great also.  I like books like this where the main character has some hero like qualities, but is far from a super hero and has to overcome the opposition and weaknesses of other characters in the book to achieve his goal, sometimes compromising the means.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It fun and entertaining, the competitions are also pretty easy. The app is easy to use too
B008RA3X5E|5.0|simple and nice as an app like this should be. word11 word12 word13 word14 word15 word16 word17 word18 word19 word20 ;-)
B0060ANZ2Y|5.0|A huge EWF fan. I had this album on vinyl back in the day. Had to get it on CD. It does a good job of capturing the excitement and electricity of their live performances. THE BADDEST BAND IN THE LAND!
B002RKSZWG|5.0|This fully satisfying tale of destined romance is sure to please. Austen's tale of true-love's fulfillment impeded by the perceptions of others' views about the appropriateness of the parties involved leaves the reader questioning his or her own pursuits of love.<br /><br />Austen writes of the how the road to one's soul-mate sometimes takes a long and twisted journey, through time, one's self-doubts, and the perception of others. It may take Anne and Capt. Bentwick over eight years, but true love prevails as Austen's fans all know.<br /><br />Also, Austen takes her sharp-witted pen once again to people's views of love, social climbing, societal views on women, and status-bound troglodytes. Austen still inspires today readers to question his or her own motives in love, as well as the motives of others.<br /><br />Finally, Austen wraps this beautiful tale of true love in the exquisiteness of her style--both vividly concrete and syntactically challenging--and her character study of the status-quo breaking heroine.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|The acting in this movie was exceptional.  The compassion, wit, and humanity brought to this story of a man who spent most of his life in an iron lung was fantastic.  I consider this a must see movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this card game. I love playing all kinds of card games. I wish there were more card games to play
B003JTHXOK|4.0|liked it alot and can't wait to see the movie.  i would have liked more at the end of the book about the couple .
6305508550|5.0|I purchased this movie for school - Gonzaga University - as we will write a paper about it an communication. The movie arrived very quickly and in great condition.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|this spinart app is suuuuuper fun.it makes fun even funner. it is beawesome. beawesome means beyond awesome by the way. so what if its $2 its worth it. my friend had the app on her phone and i played it sooo much. i couldt wait till it came out for the kindle fire. also you can get different  shapes like if u dont want a square u can choose a circle a shamrock a dog a butterfly. this game is aweeome i totally recommend  it!!!!!!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Nice colors on the digital clock.  Alarm sounds retro.  Easy to set and turn off.  Great for travelling or at home.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using the YouVersion of the Bible for just a couple of weeks and already love it.  The options of so many translations of the Bible to choose from, choice of font size and the audible Bible is great.  Now I can drive, cook or other chores while listing to God's Word.  High recommend this wonderful opportunity.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|My wife and I have slowly been catching up on the old Disney classics. Be warned that the content does reflect the time the film was made.
B008G59IKO|5.0|this is a great mid cd to listen to especially when your tired of hearing all the new crap pop worthless stuff. keeps the flow going awesome stuff
0307292134|3.0|My husband has read the lot, and gone on to the more recent books. He feels that the story-line can move a little too slow, and a question - why does the author kill off all the main characters??
B00AIA89HS|5.0|this is an awesome hardcore full throttle hatebreeed album. i like it. they got that feel again. especially when dealing with a dumb a  ss boss like mine who lies steals cheats wastes tax payers money just like dear leader in charge of all us proletariets. big fan of the band kicks a ss
B000SZK41M|4.0|I discovered Bruce Willis in RED.  As you can tell. I'm not a great movie fan, but I do enjoy cartoon like shoot-em-ups.  I like some character development and this could have used more, but there was also some humor,  I am looking forward to viewing the rest of the Die Hard DVD's.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|this is an awesome cd and collection gd rocks every time . green day has its own sound. keep cranking em out boys. long roadtrip music. mix of early and later material good show of their carreer and work. revolution baby.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This documentary by Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters/Nirvana fame is extremely well done. Grohl covers the history of the iconic Sound City studio rounded out by interviews, sound clips, pictures, and film of all the musicians that set the music scene on fire in the 70s and 80s. He then documents the recording process of Reel to Real, his new album recorded on Sound City's classic Neve sound board which was moved to his recording studio. Seeing Grohl interact with legends like Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield and Sir Paul McCartney gave me goosebumps. Can't wait to here the final product. Bottom line: If you're a music fan, buy this film!
B008G59IBI|5.0|this is an awesome cd even for a longtime fan like me. i like 1 song in particular on here 99 revolutions. this is good stuff unlike this crap they call pop nowadays.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|For a FPS on the kindle this game's control s were wicked easy to get use to and the HUD could very easily be changed in the options. The game play was a bit shorter than i expected, but the multi-player was okay.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Well I can't find my way around this game, and deffinetly am not enjoying it....as a matter of fact, you can take it back....thank you
B001NT057K|4.0|You loved the movie, you'll love the album, cause you get exactly what was in it. The girlfriend really loves it ,not really my taste, but that's just it- taste! You like the 50's gig, you should love this.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Had a overheating problem with my old Dell 1420. Used this and now i don't hear the fan getting stressed.<br /><br />Note: Takes about 200 hours of operation for the paste to perform at its best.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very moving story and beautifully written, too.<br />Moyes is a joy tor ead.<br />She is an exceptional writer.<br />Glad to acquint myself with her books.
B009IEXKXI|2.0|The story is boring, always repeating the same things with no new activity. I got tired of it and didn´t go trough the end.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Although, clearly the gang of New York hustlers in this series are a lot more civilized -- the attention to detail by the producers is top notch ... the show gives you a great feel for the sickening '50s era (if you lived through the 50s you'll know what I mean!).  The '50s/'60s clothing, furniture, home decor, etc styles are also right on.  It makes for a more realistic viewing experience.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so much betters:)) I looooooooooove it so much. I wish I could play more often. it is way better than the first.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I've been using this app twenty minutes a day after work, and the yoga one before work...it's been a couple of weeks and I've already lost a pant size.<br />I love that it mixes up the workouts and it's never the same workout twice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great challenge.  Keeps you going until you crash. Then you get mad and keep going. Love the boosters it lets you get a little further . I will make it through it. Love the little dog.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun so far. I just purchased it for 4.99. A bit pricey, but play it and decide whether the game is worth the money - it was to me.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is a light, enjoyable quick read, full of humorous situations.  Recommended as a great stress reliever, beach read, or laugh out loud diversion.
B0014CDKVY|5.0|This version had a much better ending, with him sailing off in the sunset.  Will Smith is always my hero.
B006O6F932|5.0|This is an awesome playset! Lots of little details that replicate the show! Recommend highly to play with or for a collector!
1449410243|2.0|But the book does not come close to my hopes.  I'm a little suprised this was talked about so favorably on NPR.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|I downloaded this when I had trouble viewing a video on my Kindle Fire.  It didn't seem to help in that category.  Glad I didn't pay anything for it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My seven year loves to play this app.  She loves to care for her horse. She has lots of fun.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is a well written series and disturbing in its implications of &#34;security&#34;.<br />The American public should take it as more than soap opera.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this awhile back because a friend recommended it and because it was so popular. I finished the book, but just barely. The characters are unrealistic and the writing atrocious. When a reader begins to notice that certain words and phrases are repeated over and over, it means the author is lazy. My friend gave me the other two in the series, and I just can't bring myself to read them.
B008ENA74E|4.0|When Greg Smith first came to Goldman Sachs as an intern in college he was full of youthful enthusiasm. During that first summer, he completely bought into the Goldman Sachs ethos of taking care of the client and to hold high professional standards. Starting work weeks before 9-11, Smith was on high. For years he steadily climbed the ranks as Goldman Sachs became bigger and stronger. Eventually however, Smith leaves in disgust at the toxic atmosphere that is now rampant in the company. This is a great look at the life of a trader at one of the most public of institutions, Goldman Sachs.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Extremely addictive. Great graphics. Cubes are enough alike that it isn't &#34;easy&#34; to fly through the game. It requires a degree concentration. Games are timed, so those of us that are competitve strive to beat our best time. Great game!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I am so sad that the adventures of Percy and friends are over now. What a great set of books and what an awesome way to educate on Greek mythology!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love Mahjong in any form.  Love to play it.  There are many forms.  I am looking for one with cars though as years ago there was one.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Great game... Wish they had different levels of play... Finished this game in  2 weeks... Need more... much much more.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My three year old grandson is better at this than I am!  He gets higher scores than I do on this
B008OOYALE|5.0|I liv this app the only problem is it takes a little while to load and my daughter loves it
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Haven't quite figured the weather channel out yet.  Haven't had a whole lot of time to try it out with different zones.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Brilliant! The story starts of in one direction but the tables turn half way through. Think I would have preferred a different ending, but a good read none the less :)
B00AESN8XY|5.0|its a really great game and I'm only 12 but its really fun game to play on my kindle fire its NOT hd but its just a kindle fire 1st generation
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Everybody should by this book it is the book of a lifetime!<br /><br />I would say it is my favorite book.<br /><br />I read this book and I wish I could go back in time and read it over and over again!This book changes your life!
B004LWZW6U|1.0|The 3D disco is w/out subtitular, a parte que la película es lo peor que he visto, es una comedia mala
B004FPE4DK|5.0|I enjoy his tone and style.  His lyrical content tells stories with instrumental background.  A good, mellow listen.  He's straight up good music.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I bought the non-Blu-Ray version.  Back of the DVD jacket has Special Featuures:<br /><br />,John Hawkes becomes Mark O'Brien<br />.Helen Hunt As A Sex Surrogate<br />.The Woman Who Loved Mark O'Brien<br /><br />Found out the above's not available...BUMMER!  Probably on the Blu-Ray version?<br /><br />Loved the movie, especially since my late wife contracted Bulbar Polio (same as Mark) in 1952 at age of 12.  She spent 6 months in an Iron Lung.  Probably would not have liked the Iron Lung scenes...very bad memories.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Every song is GREAT!!  Brittany rocks!  I can't wait to hear what they come out with next! Real music, real good!  Give it a try!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show and can't wait for the next season. I am still reeling from what happened in Season 3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have never enjoyed a television series as much as this one. Excellent acting and beautiful scenery.  Really enjoyed the gorgeous scenery on their trip to Scotland. Didn't like the conclusion but it hasn't detered my love of the Downton Abbey's three productions. Looking forward to the fourth one and I  recommend this highly and urge anyone to watch it.
B00A993UWM|5.0|The songs are very raw but yet she adds a lot of feeling and emotion to them.  Certianly not for everyone though.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I thouroughly enjoyed all the Supernatural seasons even though it does get a little blasphemous from time to time. I highly recommend starting at the beginning with season 1. This said the 8th season is on par with the previous seasons with the exception of a beloved character that is killed off and replaced with a one that is inadequate for the role.
0307887448|5.0|I LOVE this story!  I can not waite until they make it into a movie, although I can't imagine it could be as good as the book.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Benedict Cumberbach and Martin Freeman play off each other so well. Watching the two of them is entertaining in and of itself, but then you add that it is Sherlock Holmes stories and that just makes it even better!
0375414932|5.0|Amazing book, warm, full of life and philosophical. A book which also has been made into a movie by the BBC! I highly recommend both!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is filled with many fun, surprising things. To make  it better, there needs to be a sandbox mode. If you don't know what that is, it is a thing eye where you have unlimited money and you can choose a which blooms to come!!! NEEDS SANDBOX MODE TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER!!!!!!
B00447L4KA|5.0|Gift for sister over the holidays. If you haven't seen this movie, watch. It's worth it. Three more words required.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was chosen for my book club.  I was surprised at how much I loved the book.  I thought the plot moved along at a good pace and I was always looking forward to what would happen next.  Night Circus really allows you to imagine fantastic scenes in the circus.  I highly recommend this book.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Bond films, but this one was the best!! Lots of action and great story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love it! The anticipation each week, waiting for the next episode-- Such well developed, &#34;real&#34; people, so easy to love or hate. Just when you think a character can no longer be tolerated, things change and you find something worthwhile in them.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is just one of those classics that can be read over and over and still enjoy it.<br />Plus it's free!
B000FCJZ3G|4.0|Quick summary<br /><br />Some great insights into opening your awareness on who you are and why when it comes to money and wealth.<br /><br />What's involved in changing your current money situation and some tips on how to achieve that change.<br /><br />Think passive income over paid by the hour work.<br /><br />Biggest take away for me is  - take action now!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved this game!  It was filled with intrigue and interesting clues the whole game.  Kept me on my toes and kept me guessing.  Well worth the time spent to complete the game.  Just one piece of advice, make full use of the map for getting around and for locating hot spots of activity.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series. The scenes are so beautiful and the characters are interesting. This is my latest tv series addiction.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I received a Kindle Fire for Christmas and have not used it very much.  I ordered the calculator plus knowing that I would have a need  for this item when I finally learn how to use the Kindle Fire.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|What a beautiful story...shows how people can accomplish great things by love and caring...gave group homes a good feeling contrary to popular belief...
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My wife, the reason why we downloaded this movie, told me to give it a five-star ranking. 'Nuff said! Plus,  the female lead, who played opposite George Rooney in \\"Up in the Air,\\" plays a completely believable college freshman in this one.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Great g a me play never gets to old.<br />Love Flow she's back at it better than ever.<br />Same great colors,but different characters.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I spent the time for this with my wife, thinking it would be good for her, found out it was just as good for me.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|i love this app. my son loves this app.what we both dont like is waiting three to for weeks for updates that everbody else has, amazon needs to get with raviol and work something out, learn what coming soon means ,maybe give us a date rather than just ,coming soon, but on the other side WE LOVE ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This &#34;Trespassing&#34; album of Adam's is the best whole album I've EVER heard!!  There is not ONE song on there that I don't JUST LOVE!!  I truly NEVER had an album like this one!!.........and that's going some since I'm a die-hard Elvis friend & fan!!  All I can say is......&#34;GO GET ONE FOR YOURSELF & SEE!!&#34;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started this on a friends recommendation. The story immediately pulled me in. The possibility that this could be real is a simultaneously fascinating and horrifying though.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Slow beginning, great middle, lousy ending.  I really liked the style in which the novel was written and was super into the story and then felt cheated by the ending.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|It is probably much better for Skype, but I've used it for a few pictures too.  It's hard to do that because of the forward facing camera, but the price was right and it takes decent pictures.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|Why no Grammy?  Very well written.  Listen on the treadmill to keep me going.  Thoughtful lyrics.  Don't know why comparison to Bruce Springfield because he sucks and is an Obama lap dog, so forget that hack.  The Gaslight Anthem, great American Band!!
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I am pretty sure I would not pick him up if I saw him hitch hiking but he is a great addition to the world (yes, I know he is not real).  A lot of action and surprises ...really do wish he changed his clothes more often...it is almost distracting .  Love his logic and analytical skills.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Crashes and hard to get gems. Overall a fairly decent game. I like how it gives you an experience to take care of the horse with good animations.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This movie has all the classic Woody Allen themes and is also very watchable for a general audience. I recently watched To Rome with Love with my hubby and he was barely able to sit through it, but he like Midnight in Paris even though I've watched it over and over. I put it on for noise during the day. So many of the scenes stand on their own and are very funny. If you're a fan of WA's work, it is like Woody Allen is wearing an Owen Wilson costume.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Had to own this movie.  It was so funny and always wanted a teddy bear like &#34;Ted&#34;, who wouldn't want one.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|daughter hoggin it but i do love it n so does she, maybe i will buy her one two  soon
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This was  a FABULOUS production. The music was unbelievable, especially with the full base sound system. I loved it! Characters were well developed also! Looking forward to season 2!
1423140605|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is filled with action and awesome heroes.  Riordan delivers.  The two camps must learn to overcome their mistrust, much like many of opposing beliefs in the world where we live today.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Coin Dozer is quite addictive.  It's fun and challenging, but it goes on forever.  I would much prefer a shorter version of this game. I have not found a way to end one game and start a new one.  I have found no way for another person to set up their own game.  More detail is needed in the game description.  There is no &#34;help&#34; available.
B0086221SS|3.0|I kept waiting for something to happen and when it finally did the result did not match the personality or character traits of the two people who were falling in love.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong puzzles was thrilled to be able to get this download for my Kindle Fire!  It's every bit as good as any other version I've played.  I only wish the tiles were larger and easier to see.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Excellent Movie which displays the horrors of alcoholism in powerful ways. Denzel Washington is superb in the role as an addicted pilot.
B000085RTZ|5.0|I bought this album for my brother's wife to go with The Black Halo for Christmas, but she was cheating on him, and took his kids, house and car.  We haven't spoken, so I don't know what condition the album was in.  I have a copy, though, and I like it ^_^
B0086700CM|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game. It's a good time waster and performs beautifully on my kindle fire. Can't wait to see what's coming in Temple Run 2! I'll never get anything done....
B0007OASII|5.0|I bought this album for my brother's wife for Christmas, to pair with Epica.  She ended up cheating on him, taking his kids, house and car because the woman is always right.  I like the album, though, and hope this one was a good copy.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I had read this story when it was first published.  Didn't remember lots of the details and enjoyed it for a 2nd time.  Follett engrosses me in his descriptions and details.  Life in this time was tough for all but the privileged and rich.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This was a great movie!  It was at the top of my list for must buy for my DVD collection.  Top shelf actors, awesome special effects and a cool and intriguing store line.  I loved everything about this movie, and it was clean enough that my boys (9 and 13) could enjoy it with me.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|It would make a great movie. Light on actual dogfights experience. Which disappoints. Funny how every German today in these stories was anti Hitler. I guess in the future when they write about the disaster Obama is and was Democrats will say the same thing.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Came in about a week so got it right before xmas! Perfect case and lots of bonus features. The Blu- Ray looked soooooooooo amazing on the big screen. It brings the Indy Jones movies to ANOTHER LEVEL! bUY IT OMG
0446547654|5.0|I have read all of his books and there is not one yet that I have disliked.They are all Awesome
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing is the one word I can think to describe this story. I cred, laughed, and cried some more. The main characters were extraordinary. So broken yet extremely strong. This story will give \\"Hope\\" to all those that have been sexually abused.
B0086Q3OGC|5.0|Excellent book written in a way I'm not accustom to by Rick, as every 2 chapters switch to another of the 3 heros. The story an twists in this book still have a strong Percy Jackson feel. A must read for all Percy Jackson fans
B001NHNG64|3.0|I have not been reading Lee Child's books based on the character Jack Reacher in order, but I found this one explored Jack's logistic thinking more superficially than later books.  Having said that, I am a huge fan having read 7 Reacher books since I first learned of them in early January, 2013.
B008476HBM|5.0|I recommend this book for all to read if you are a romanticist. This book is about chivalry, friendship, total loyalty among sisters and most of all true love over coming obstacles of power and money. I love the part when she is confronted by the Aunt and all her responses. She is sharp to the point and remains a Lady.
1416562605|5.0|this is a great book and well worth reading. The writer has an easy style and he is a great story teller. the characters are there in your head and you cannot wait for the next part of the story. I found it a simple tale of India and the world, well told and I am glad I read it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this for my wife, and she loves it. Everything about the description of the DVD is spot on. What more could you want for the results you need?! I highly recommend this product!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is a masterful story teller. If I live long enough, I am in hopes someone like Mitch Rapp runs for office.
B000HF6XNG|5.0|This product was every thing that my 8 year old daughter had hoped for.  It also came earlier than we had anticipated which of course she thought was awesome.  Thank you!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved the first temple run and I'm happy that there's a second one.  But when I got this game I could only play the first couple of times.  The next time I tried to play it kept saying temple run is not working. Its an awesome game but I really hate the crashes.  If it didnts crash so much it would get 5 stars.  The only thing I don't like besides the crashing is the part when you get in a minecart because its hard. But I like temple run 2's upgrades better then the first. :)
B000AQJPQE|5.0|I love everything about this product, it's educational, looks very cool, works as a night light since it turns off after 10 minutes.  The only thing is it was a little tricky to hang and it's a hassle to pull down and have to replace the batteries.  But still so worth it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|what's not to love, anyone who tries pinterest loves it!  It is wonderful that I can get it on my kindle and when I don't wanna read or do other things I go to pinterest and scroll and window shop!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Unicorns are beautiful<br />My three year old loves playing with the horses she can actual feed and groom them.  Just wish it was easier to get gems.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|i WANTED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A PICTURE OF SOMETHING AND STORE IT ON MY KINDLE, BUT THE LENS FACES THE WRONG WAY FOR THAT AND I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL!
B008Q0AZVK|1.0|I never could get the movie to run completely! It kept reloading. I tried it about 10 minutes then gave up! Not worth the effort! Very disappointed!
B009Y2KGSQ|5.0|I love Asmith and saw them 16 times... I sing just like Steven and write also...Great job guy's... lots of that saw tooth rough edge... Love it!!!
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Ask Eric Clapton. He has said the same thing.<br />SRV and Double Trouble brought Blues Rock back to life. Unfortunately, I did not get to know them until the In Step album when the radio stations started playing his music in my home town, Pittsburgh, PA. Once I heard him play I was truly amazed and could never get enough of their music. Live at the El Macombo is one of my all time favorites and even though I haven't heard the live performance at Ripley's Music Hall in Philly yet I am sure it is just as good if not better. Can't wait to hear it!<br />ROCK ON Stevie Ray!
B008JFUMT2|4.0|Bruce Willis cracks wise.  Cars crash.  Bullets fly.  Things explode spectacularly.  If this is what you're expecting from \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\", you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />It should go without saying that the Die Hard movies aren't exactly Shakespeare.  While the first in the series revolutionized the action genre, the title has become a brand name that fans trust, and audiences have a fair idea what to expect with each new entry.  Most Bruce Willis movies are carried by the star's charisma and likability, and unlucky NYPD detective John McClane is his quintessential role.  While the first two movies were based on separate novels, the third was a finished script tweaked to include the McClane character, and the fourth was a dramatization of an article on cyberterrorism, Skip Woods' script may be the first written intentionally around the hero of the franchise.  Not only does it have some nice nods to the previous films, but it hits all the major bullet points of the formula.  As always, McClane finds himself in the most dangerous situations when he's off duty (\\"I'm supposed to be on vacation!\\" he growls several times when he's held at gunpoint).  He gets out of desperate situations by improvising dangerous feats that would make James Bond think twice.  Only to begin chastising himself, out loud for the audience's benefit, after he's already taken the plunge and realized what a stupid idea it was.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie lacks a strong villain for McClane to play cat and mouse with.  Previous movies had Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, and Timothy Olyphant chewing the scenery in that capacity.  This time, evil is mainly personified by the forgettable Radivoje Bukvic, but, like William Sadler in [[ASIN:B00AGDX2F6 Die Hard 2: Die Harder]], he's not as important as the series of plot twists and turns slowly revealing a greater evil at play.  Only brief moments of exposition break up the set pieces here, starting with a lengthy car chase, one of thebest I've seen in a long time, during which everything you'd want to have happen in a chase scene does.  The action moves from the Moscow highway to Chernobyl, packed with exciting pyrotechnics and stunts that look like they'd be fun in real life if it weren't for the fact that they'd maim anyone who hadn't already thwarted major terrorist plots four times before.<br /><br />This time, McClane learns his estranged son, John \\"Jack\\" McClane Jr., is about to stand trial in Moscow.  Wanting to reconcile before Jack's thrown in prison, John Sr. makes it to the courtroom right as his son escapes, along with another prisoner awaiting trial (Sebastian Koch).<br /><br />Mary Elizabeth Winstead returns as John's daughter Lucy.  While she doesn't get to see any of the action this time around, she's still great in the role and it's nice to see some continuity with [[ASIN:B0011MZOEI Live Free or Die Hard]] from six years ago.  Jai Courtney, for his part, does a good job playing McClane's son, sharing his dad's short temper and penchant for yelling at himself when he makes a mistake.  But the real stand out is Yuliya Snigir as Irina, the beautiful daughter of Jack's fellow escapee.  Big eyed, pouty lipped, and leather clad, Yuliya Snigir is seriously gorgeous and commands more screen presence than any of the other newcomers to the series.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the movie ends too quickly.  After the story's best plot twist, when the movie seems to be picking up real momentum, the movie reaches its finale at around the length the other Die Hard movies were just gearing up for their third act.  The \\"Yippee-Ki-Yay\\" catchphrase is thrown in there, and it feels a little too obligatory.<br /><br />But, to recap, Bruce Willis does what Bruce Willis does best, the stunts and explosions are thrilling and come non-stop, the script includes some truly surprising twists, and Yuliya Snigir's mouthful of a name is about to become a household one.  While \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" is far from the best in the series, it sure beats most of the alternatives playing in theaters this February.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app. I have have had this app about 1 year now and I have had no problems. I would definitely recommend this app.
B005NKGEP2|1.0|After the first 20 pages, this book was totally predictable.  The main character is a complete ditz!  Her husband was even worse.  Housework, really?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. I just can't wait until season 4 the suspense is almost more than I can handle
1451695195|3.0|Despite the narcissistic nonsense inherent in much private revelation, a true scientific impulse to unveil the reality of a soul or an angel or God persists. Sir Isaac Newton, hailed by one biographer as The Last Sorcerer, was an avid if closet alchemist as were many of his contemporaries at the dawn of modern scientific experimentation. The great advances in the 20th century science dimmed the power of supernatural claims so much that a great divide exists between hard science and lofty religion. Dr Eben Alexander's book is the latest in a long line of responses to this rift. Others have thoroughly reviewed his Proof of Heaven. Many have seen Alexander on Oprah or heard him on NPR and visited his popular website lifebeyonddeath.<br /><br />Briefly, Alexander writes about his near death experience (NDE) several years ago when he went into a coma for many days as a result of a rare E-coli meningitis or severe infectious pus that shut down his brain and much of his nervous system. His physicians had little hope for his survival. While in coma, Dr Alexander recalled an extraordinary existence in another realm that was heavenly. He recalled being taken on a cosmic tour by an angelic young woman in plain human attire after experiencing a primal soup of smelly creation and creatures, an earthworm level. She flew him to a blissful place where people, animals and angels interacted and then to something he called the Core or the place of God, a being he got to calling Om because there was a primal brilliant void accented by indescribably holy sounds. In heaven he had instant answers to questions from the personal Om that was and was not the author at the same time.<br /><br />Alexander was an accomplished aviator and successful neuroscientist in mid-age when he went into the coma. He was also a skeptic about God and heaven, practically an atheist. \\"Science seemed to be providing a steady onslaught of evidence that pushed our significance in the universe ever closer to zero\\"(35). His experience in heaven not only redirected his perception; it also re-energized his mood, healing him of a long, subtle depression regarding his adopted roots. He was born again for all intents and purposes, religious or not.<br /><br />Since his NDE, Alexander has been on a mission to argue beyond the best scientific dismissals for the existence of heaven. Science has not ruled out the reality of his experience. For example, the rebooting of his brain after coma can not account for what he recalled, he says. He surmises that he is unique among the NDE crowd that retained greater or entire brain function during their experiences. Personally, I have no bone to pick with him about his heavenly experience whether it \\"really\\" happened or he made it up. What interests me is not to try to disprove extraordinary NDE claims but to see what people do with them after. I am curious about behavior or more precisely: How does a person after an NDE incorporate the experience, make sense of it for society and for self?<br /><br />I.M. Lewis once observed in his book Ecstatic Religion that after an ecstasy (to stand outside oneself) you will invariably bond with the environment in which it took place or the source that appeared to inspire it. If one has a born-again ecstasy in a Pentecostal church meeting, that church will most likely be the place of worship and the Gospel the source of inspiration for a long time if not for life.  If one takes a psychedelic herb in the Amazon rain forest with an indigenous tribe, the herb (entheogen) and that shaman administering it will likely form the narrative that explains the experience. Any number of cult leaders and motivational seminar promoters know this: If you can engineer an ecstasy, OBE (out of body experience), an emotional breakdown and breakthrough, or group euphoria, then you can better maintain the devotion of the client/recruit to your scientific system, therapy, religion or cult. When I read Proof of Heaven I was not surprised to find that Alexander fell into a milieu indicated in his book that supported his experience. What is that milieu? How does he dumb it down for our consumption?<br /><br />The author actually has some insight into this process of why we inevitably have to dumb down our NDE and brushes with heaven--there are no words, myths, poems, or narratives that properly carry the sacred into the profane. Alexander remained the scientist by addressing every brain function he knew to dismiss purely materialistic explanations. He turned to the Monroe Institute, a seemingly secular organization where clients can go to have OBE type experiences induced. Alexander found that Monroe's approach using a trademarked Hemi-Synch brain wave manipulation helps him and others approximate what he discovered while in coma, the Gateway Experience promoted by Monroe. Alexander uses some of the Monroe language in describing his OBE as having three realms: Earthworm eye view, the Gateway and the Core.<br /><br />At Monroe, Alexander found that he is unique but not alone. His mission to promote these experiences coincides with Monroe's experiments with transcendent awareness. Although he lightly acknowledges the Christian mystical traditions, his bibliography essentially ignores them in keeping with his desire to remain trans-religious. He discovers no judgment in heaven: \\"...nothing can tear us from God\\" (14). Alexander encourages us to \\"cultivate\\"...\\"this miraculous aspect of ourselves\\" and \\"bring it to light\\" (85). His experience of heaven appears to have transcended all religion (as most mystical experience does by definition). He positively references Eastern religion, the Dalai Lama (of course), and a host of New Age or psi-believers including Rupert Sheldrake, ex-priest Matthew Fox, Gerald Jampolsky and Marianne Williamson inspired by A Course in Miracles, reincarnation therapist Brian Weiss, death and dying observer Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, Gnostic apologist Elaine Pagels, and self-styled \\"non-dual\\" mystic Ken Wilber.<br /><br />Alexander's Gnostic side is revealed in Chapter 32 in barely two pages when he attends an Episcopal service on a Sunday with family shortly after his recovery. He feels the sacred space in an entirely new way as he approaches the altar to take the host. \\"A painting of Jesus breaking bread with his disciples evoked the communion of the Core. I shuddered as I recalled the bliss of infinite unconditional love I had known there. At last, I understood what religion was supposed to be about. I didn't just believe in God; I knew God\\" (147-148).<br /><br />Carl Jung essentially answered that same way in a famous interview: I do not believe in God; I know he said. I have low regard for Jung's disjointed Gnostic side--I think his mentor Freud was right to warn him about the \\"black tide of the occult.\\" Jung got into some dicey territory as a therapist and scientist. Why try to paint kitchy, sensational or arbitrary portraits of angels and Jesus when you can paint wonderful pictures of your neighbor? Jung missed a lot on the ground where most of his clients lived and breathed in their anxieties.<br /><br />This is not to say that I dismiss Alexander's integrity or experience. I like the book for its easy reading style and apparent honesty. But Alexander draws some insights consistent with apocalyptic Christianity as well as New Ageism. He believes that we are \\"in a crucial time in our existence\\" (72)--as if ever we were not in a crucial time. In other words, he overreaches by projecting the particular experience onto the global environment: This is how I see it--this is how it is!<br /><br />But I am curious to see where his campaign to convince us that heaven exists goes ten years from now. Just for the record, I am not one that needs convincing about heaven but I find Alexander's approach to \\"cultivate the miraculous aspect of ourselves...by manifesting love and compassion\\" a tad delusional. Here he is revisiting the super-idealism of New Thought religion. He insists that God truly lives within us \\"right now and that is in fact the being that God truly intends us to be.\\" He claims that \\"love and compassion are far more than the abstractions that many of us believe them to be. They are real. They are concrete. And they make up the very fabric of the spiritual realm\\" (85). In this latter regard, Alexander falls smack into the Theosophical and New Thought/A Course in Miracles (ACIM) religious frameworks.<br /><br />Love and compassion as well as fear and hate are to Theosophists and New Thought religionists thought forms with quantifiable existence like gasoline and oil in an engine. Theosophists C. W. Leadbeater and A. Besant published a small illustrated book called Thought Forms on 1906. Similar to Alexander, ACIM talked at length about the holy instant in which there is no separation from God, that separation from God is but an illusion, that we can use daily meditations or affirmations provided by ACIM to erase this illusion and stay one with God. Similar to Alexander, Eckhart Tolle has made a career out of this simple insight of the \\"Power of Now\\" and the illusion of material life. People throng to be in Tolle's presence as if he exudes this magical power like an Eastern guru that can transmit shaktipat, which is a kind of electrical jolt to the Kundalini energy.<br /><br />The reason I find all this holy hoopla about love as an independent energy that can be stored through meditation and somehow sent is the high propensity for human beings to fool themselves and others that this is actually taking place. If this were true, then the Transcendental Meditation cult or something like it would have brought peace to this planet ages ago. But TM in my experience has been nothing more than a spiritual wrecking crew for naïve seekers that fall into its depths. (See the documentary David Wants To Fly as a good example of what I mean about TM). Like TM Alexander misses an essential fact about love: Love requires relationship with and sacrifice for the other in real, not imaginary ways. Love as pure energy, as Alexander claims, does not exist in this life. Until I am dead, really dead never to come back, there is nothing else no matter what people say with OBEs or NDEs. Pretending to be God now will only bring on pride and more narcissism no matter how delightful it may feel for a time.
B0012KL736|5.0|While I could write this entire review about Jurassic Park and how amazing that movie is, I won't.  The seller described this item in perfect detail, shipped quicker than stated, and was packaged perfectly.  All discs play smoothly, movie box was in great shape. Will be buying from seller again.
B00992CF6W|4.0|As a Full PC Edition player I found that Pocket Edition (PE) was lacking.<br /><br />Firstly , the interface is different in a sense that you don't have a mouse. I believe this to be mostly my preference but I like the mouse interface over the tap-tap-tap. (Not a game killer)<br /><br />Secondly , Way more building items to work with in PC then PE. If you like to build very detail oriented designs. This is not your Game version.<br /><br />Thirdly, PE Lan games are not compatible with PCs on the same network...Your PC will not see the PE open to Lan.<br />With that being said, PE is NOT meant to be that same as the PC game. Just a variant of the game. The ideas are the same just done differently.<br /><br />BUT  &#62;&#62;&#62; If you've never played the PC edition. You will find the game entertaining. Building in PE is done quickly.  The graphics on the Kindle Fire are nice and vivid . I get very little lag or jitters . I have played well over an hour with battery gauge at about 1/4 battery left. I would imagine it would do better with network turned off.<br />I did not have an additional PE running the network, so I can not report the network play was.<br />The people at Mojang are good folks and they have tech support available.<br /><br />I do recommend Pocket Edition if you are a builder and you have an imagination.
B005HSL626|4.0|not that much of a game for me, but the kids love it and it keeps them entertained and happy
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Got this for the Kindle Fire and I use it all the time. Not a lot to say other than nice, big keys and it does what it's intended to do. Nice colors, too, vs. a boring interface.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|For a lifetime dieter and addictive personality, this was wonderful insight as to why we do the things we do and how we seem to always justify them.  Loved it....recommend it.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This is my first time to play this type of game. I was immediately hooked. I'm stuck right now but I can't wait to get through to continue the journey.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is super fun I really like it just like cut the rope original why does it have to be
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Beautiful book, very real and touching. Everyone can identify with some part of this story. A must read for any age.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|I am not a fan of Matt Damon but, oddly enough, I really love the Bourne series.  Kinda like so good even Damen couldn't screw it up.  The new star, Jeremy Renner is MUCH more believable as a rugged, rough and tumble super spy.  The story line is,as always, fairly modest marrying the end of the Damon saga to the new.  Lot's of Bourne action, car chases, etc.  If you love Bourne you'll love this.  If you watch Bourne for Matt Damon you may be unhappy - but then again you may need to access your viewing choices.
B007RJTHXS|3.0|I found this movie because it is apparently an influence for Wes Anderson's _Moonrise Kingdom_. I can see the influence, but it's definitely not as charming. Maybe it was just getting used to the accent. The movie seemed to be more about the relationship between the two boys than the boy-girl relationship. In fact, it isn't until about an hour into the movie that we see them express their feelings for each other.<br /><br />It's full of songs by the Bee Gees. I liked the music a lot, but it's not music-driven the way _Moonrise Kingdom_ is. Maybe my expectations were too high? It's a good movie, but not a great one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow, this book kept me well hooked for 24 hours!  I could barely function while reading it as I just wanted to know what happened!<br /><br />Where do I start? I started this book Hopeless late last night because Maryse had recommended it and I loved Colleen Hoovers other books.  I happened to see it cheap on Amazon at only $3.99 so I downloaded it.  The kindle app onto my iPhone and iPad have allowed me to troll amazon as well as my library and bookstore!.  I read the first few chapters last night and had to go to bed (my alarm rings at 4:30 weekdays!).  I couldn't stop thinking about the book all day and was even telling my work friends that all I wanted to do was go home and finish reading the book!<br /><br />Fast forward to 7:30pm on Friday night when my husband comes home from work and I'm out in the alfresco area with 30 pages left to go in the book and a glass of wine beside me.<br /><br />Husband: Honey, why don't I have any clean clothes for work tomorrow?<br /><br />Me: Eh?<br /><br />Husband: I'm starving!<br /><br />Me: Huh? Ok I'll make you some mushroom pasta in a minute.<br /><br />Husband: No thanks, I'll cook myself a steak.<br /><br />Me: Ok great sounds good (continues reading).<br /><br />Now I've finished the book and poured myself another glass of wine to write this entry.  (He finished his steak)<br /><br />I knew Colleen Hoover was a great author after reading Slammed and Point of Retreat so I went to the bookstore asking for Hopeless but they said it was only in eBook form at the moment so I downloaded it.<br /><br />This is another high school based romance story with a lot of twists and turns along the way.  If I didn't have so many other books in my queue to read I would definitely read this one again.  In fact, I might read it again in July just before Holders Point of View comes out! (Can you believe it??? Colleen Hoover announced it yesterday on her blog).  I just saw you can read Holders Point of View for their 'best first kiss' which I just read and was amazing!<br /><br />You can read my full review at Bec's Book Blog as well as pictures of who I think should play Holder if this book were every made into a movie!h I just read and was amazing!<br /><br />You can read my full review at Bec's Book Blog as well as pictures of who I think should play Holder if this book were every made into a movie!
B006BXT4TI|5.0|This is one the absolute best albums of the year. I love every song on it, and it's perfect to listen to in the car or even at work when you need a pick-me-up. It's so upbeat and fun. The standout songs to me are &#34;Little Black Submarines&#34; and &#34;Gold On The Ceiling,&#34; but they're all great. Buy this album!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I couldn't put it down once I got into the story, which was from the very beginning. Truely enjoyed the innocent love story and was glad it was not all jacked up with sex.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|It was &#34;ok&#34; for a hour and 1/2 of a black and white. It's not that I need color, but paying extra to watch it in HD is kinda dumb. It's a typical Tim Burton movie, funny along with some scary moments....at least for 7 year olds. Rent it from a redbox and you'll be just fine. :)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I first heard about Chris Kyle a few months ago, a few weeks he tragically died. Reading this book gives me a new perspective on patriotism, war and our brave men and women. To read what he went through, what his wife went through (yes, you get to 'hear' from her too) has made me realize that everything I knew about war was... very sugar coated. When I first heard about Him - The Legend - I want to meet him. I know realize that ... how do I put it... he represented every service man and woman; he didn't care about glory or popularity. To met him would have been great but to truly honor him, there is no better way than to do what he gave his life doing- serving his country and his family.
B004PIA4BI|4.0|it worked! did what it was purchased for. product came on time. no  complaints about the sellers.<br />everything seemed legit! two thumbs up!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was a very personal account of one woman's struggle to find her place in the world.  It simultaneously made me pity her and also want to strangle her.  If you enjoying being able to leave your own life behind and become someone else for a day, this is the book for you.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is a testimony of a miracle. Not long ago, a chilean jesuit priest, Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga,SJ. was appointed a Saint in the Roman Catholic Church on account of a very similar miracle as Dr.Alexander´s. The family of a woman who had been diagnosed  to be cortically dead for nine days commended her to the intersession of Father Hurtado and she woke up like Dr Alexander. The news reported that she read her testimony at St.Peter´s Square along with other miracles certified to the new Saint by Pope Benedict the XVI.Now, a distinguished member of  the medical profession contributes another grain of sand to the beach of Reality.I am a senior psychiatrist and deacon of the RCC and read this book in one sitting on my Kindle. I am delighted to have found it among a list of 100 most popular Amazon offers.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish.  It was a page turner all the way, keeping a girl that normally goes to bed at 10:00 up to the wee hour of midnight for 3 days straight.  My book club chose this as their February selection and all 10 of us gave it 5 stars.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My daughter and I play it everyday. She loves tio care for and clean the horses. It is expensive if you are looking to purchase in app, we just play w/o purchasing. New adds make difficult for her to play :{
B007PTJOV0|1.0|This game is by far the worst game I have ever played. It puts ads in stupid places, has horrible graphics, and messes up on some devices. If I could give a negative star I would. I do not recommend this game for anybody. The second game is better quality and is worth a 5 star rating.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|We hear so much negative in our world it was good to read of men doing the right thing simply because goodness was in them. I loved the parallel stories of these men's lives during war and how they were reunited many years later. Truth is many times stranger than fiction and much more interesting.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I was looking for a game like Mario bros. and I found the first one of this game, and I got both. I was disappointed by the first game, but I've been hooked on this one since day one. It also has much better graphics. I definitely recommend it.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Excellent movie. Seen all 007 movie in my life time.  Never get tired watching the old ones. This movie was good though
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This version was great. I don't like using hard copy books, so being able to download this (for free) was convenient. :)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this book really follows the whole series because i think it needed a little touch of what greg likes.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its fun but I don't love it. I love minecraft I just don't love the pocket edition. the computer minecraft is fun too. what I usually do is the Xbox minecraft. Xbox minecraft I love

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think it is the BEST GAME EVER very addicting and fun love the stash and characters you can buy
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel tackled a number of powerful subjects and balanced them gracefully.  The specter of mental illness, denial, unconditional love....any one of these would be a challenge, but the author managed to switch between them and combine these heavy themes with a light touch. The book stayed on my mind long after I finished it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I was on my kindle fire for the day, then was dead.... I put  it on the charger and after a whole other day it still wasn't charged.  I realized I needed a battery app. I had 1 b4 this... it didn't work. But Then I got this and it changed my kindle fire, from almost charging 2 days it charges faster then 1 day goes by! If you want a battery app, there's not no better batter saven app better then this &quot;Battery HD&quot;! (:
B004J4WLB4|4.0|While the story has been told in many forms over the years, this novel was unsparing in its exposure of the main character's self-destructiveness, which made it compelling.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the only app I have ever paid for, and it is fantastic! I have never played this game before, now I am hooked. I Love survival mode, build a castle, protect yourself from zombies, and mine for resources. So many things to do. Took me 2 hours to get a nice start, and to get the hang of it. Controls are simple, tap, and press hold to dig etc.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|The book's simple style was effective, but at times it was too simplistic and the plot twists were easy to discern well in advance.  I would recommend this for adolescents vice adults.
B00AVFO41K|4.0|I used to enjoy the game NoMess by MapleTop Software on my PalmPilot and I have been looking for something similar for my Android phone, Kindle Fire or iPod Touch.  This is very close and I find this as addictive as NoMess.  Thanks for creating this!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Totally addicted to watching the series. Now why do I have to write all of this stuff? On Netflix I just give it stars!!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|This is a good movie.  The female lead is pretty unbelievable in her acting style, so we could never really get into her character.  It's more like a TV movie, but good if you want a mindless, movie-watching evening.  We enjoyed it.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|This app for the Kindle Fire is just OK, in my opinion.  It has a good layout for finding the kind of streams you want to watch.  I think the interface is cleaner and easier to use than on their real website.<br /><br />The real downside is the quality level of the streams.  I'm no expert on stream quality details....I know that higher numbers are prettier, and on the real website I shoot for the 720p levels.  Maybe this level of quality would look fine on a phone, but on a Kindle Fire sized screen it's just kind of ugly.  I don't know what level of quality they're serving up for the app, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's 2 levels below 720, whatever that would be.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't think I'll be using this app for watching streams because of that quality level.  I'll keep it installed in case I'm really hard up, or they update to support higher quality levels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A fascinating glimpse into Victorian Age England and a telling window into human behaviors.  This series is compelling and widely popular among my contemporaries, romantic with a healthy does of realism to keep it from falling to a soap opera level.  Entertaining!

B003YUQ282|4.0|I have a wide foot and lots of foot problems, so I have learned to love Crocs over the years.  Their women's styles are narrower, which doesn't work for me, so I like to get the men's/unisex styles in a 6, which is supposedly women's 8.  Normally I wear a 7-7.5 wide, but the m6/w8 usually works pretty well for me.  I got three pairs of Hovers the first year they came out; white canvas lace-ups, two-tone tan leather lace-ups, and these black canvas slip-ons which are by far the most comfortable.  All 3 pairs got compliments, the black canvas slip-ons get the most of all, and people are always surprised to hear they're  Crocs.<br /><br />These are not just cool-looking shoes good for general putzing around in comfort.  I started walking for exercise again last year, and discovered that these were actually quite good for faster strides, even with my surgical scars and pins. Unlike the lace-up styles, there is no internal seam to rub or chafe.  Best of all, these slip-ons wash well in cold water (be sure to air dry).  I've washed this first pair three times without any issues.  I've also Scotch-guarded them twice.  I wish they made them in a thicker nap fabric like velveteen or corduroy for cold weather.<br /><br />When I started wearing the treads down, I ordered two more pairs to replace them, one from Crocs and one from Amazon.  The Crocs.com pair felt about a half-size smaller than the originals, the Amazon pair a full size smaller.  This is my biggest complaint with Crocs, since they do not offer free returns and most styles are not easy to find in stores.  At minimum, it would be nice to expect the same styles to stay the same sizes.  I've had this problem with another shoemaker, where the sizes are not consistent even within a series of supposedly similar shoes.  Consistency is more important than ever now that people are more likely to buy online.  This is very frustrating because I can't return the ones that are too small (I tried braving them for a day in hopes of breaking them in but ended up with a pinched nerve), but I'm wary of buying them in a larger size in case they've gotten their sizing back on track,<br /><br />These shoes should fit and feel a little roomy for proper stride, like most Crocs, so if yours arrive feeling at all snug be sure to exchange them for a size up.  Otherwise, get ready for a cushiony, comfortable experience!<br /><br />UPDATE: I tried a size 7m/9w, a full size larger than I'd originally been getting (there are no half-sizes), and the fit is close to the original 6m/8w, but is slightly longer and narrower.  Still a good shoe, and perhaps more appealing for those with a narrower foot, but I hope they are able to get the sizing closer to the original. I think Crocs became popular with people who have wider feet, so they should keep that in mind.  I can't wear most of their women's styles because they're so much narrower than the unisex. In trying to target a more mainstream fashion audience instead of focusing on their bread and butter which is comfort, they seem to be screwing up.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is an awesome book.  It takes up where City of Bones left off and starts to reveal a little about Clare and Jace and their unique abilities. It is full of action and adventure and continues to build on the relationships that were formed in the first book. I didn't want to put it down and can't wait to start reading City of Glass.
B002X3V4P2|2.0|I remember loving the Enya cassette tapes I had many years ago, and I was surprised how few of these songs I actually knew.  (Maybe one or possibly two.)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A friend told me about this series in the middle of the second season.  I tried to catch up as much as possible, but I know I missed some of the earlier episodes.  I am looking forward to watching it from beginning to end.  This is the type of show that I will watch again later.  It's easy to get wrapped up in the story and characters when a show is as good as this one.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Though Lonesome Dove has been around for a long time, this is the first time I have seen it.<br /><br />I am not that much of a fan of Westerns but this movie was well-written and worked on several levels. If you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it.
1606995359|5.0|Uncle Scrooge was my favorite comic when I was 8 or 9 years old, although my favorite character was Gyro Gearloose. I never could get enough of him.<br /><br />I did not know that the author-illustrator of the comic was Carl Barks - Disney was careful not to allow credit to accrue to anybody but Disney.<br /><br />Barks was a westerner, born in 1901, one of the last of that great generation of free spirits that also produced Linus Pauling and Eric Hoffer. Barks's accomplishments were less ambitious but, as it has turned out, still full of ideas for later readers to mine.<br /><br />This volume has commentary by a gaggle of American and, curiously, Italian scholars, mainly academics.<br /><br />This volume, 12th in the Fantagraphics catalogue raisonne of Barks but first in terms of the McDuck legend, introduces the skinflinty but honest Scotch duck and explains where he accumulated his \\"three cubic acres\\" of money.<br /><br />My boyhood reading came a little later in the series, and I was surprised to see how hard-edged the original Barks conception was. Scrooge, though honest, was ready to take advantage of the unwary (and was consequently often taken advantage of because of his own reluctance to pay a reasonable rate for services); and the Beagle Boys were not only vicious but cruel and murderous. Those qualities softened as the Eisenhower years rolled on.<br /><br />Barks was not political; none of the monarchism that makes Disney so unpalatable ever seeped into Duckburg, but his attitude toward wealth and the getting and spending of it was complex, as befitted a child of the frontier, where great disparities of wealth were usual and where Barks himself was one of the have-nots.<br /><br />Scrooge liked money for its own sake. He was not one for luxury, except the luxury of swimming in money. But he also was not the pinched and querulous miser of classic aspect - he was not like Ebenezer Scrooge. He did not hate and fear people with less money (though he feared the Beagle Boys' schemes), which distinguishes him from today's rich. Scrooge McDuck just liked money.<br /><br />Much of the appeal of the great comic artists was their subversive intent. Barks's subversion centered on Huey, Dewey and Louie, young ducklings who consistently showed more common sense and foresight than any older residents of Duckburg.<br /><br />As with all Fantagraphics reprints, \\"Only a Poor Old Man\\" is done in first-rate style all the way. They are not cheap, and Scrooge would be loath to buy his own book, but in the long run they are worth it.
B009MF56GC|5.0|In the first Expendables, Stallone had a great idea--a bunch of old action movie actors in an action movie with tongue firmly in cheek. However, he was too restained. Perhaps encouraged by the success of the first one, in Expendables 2 he pulled out all the stops and made what may be the campiest action movie ever.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of action movies made by Stallone, Willis, Schwartzenegger, Jet Li, Van Damme and others, don't bother watching. The inside jokes and references to their previous works come hot and heavy.<br /><br />If you are a fan, watch, enjoy and keep in mind, it may be a long time before we see a collection of actors so truly accomplished in this particular genre together again on the big screen
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|Complex, flawed characters who experience growth as the story line progresses.  A well developed fantasy world with believable character types.  The story includes an imaginative level of special abilities for both protagonists and antagonists.  There are many surprises as to how the underlying dark force manipulates events and the reader is kept just as confused as the main characters, in knowing who is doing the manipulating, why is the entity manipulating, and how can he/it be stopped!  For me this series ranks with the Robin Hobbs live ships series and the Salvatore 'Drizzt' series.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|Exceptional well done. Focused primarily on the four conspirators and the trial of Mary Surratt, operator of the Washington DC boarding house where the plot to kill President Lincoln was conceived. The cast, lead by James McAvoy and Robin Wright, are outstanding, the story and script exceptional, but of course all what we have come to expect from Robert Redford.
B009EAALII|3.0|Isaak and his terrific band are in top form, and Isaak's voice is sublime. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of songs from Isaak's &#34;Beyond The Sun effort&#34;, where Isaak's exquisite voice it truly at home. The Austin City Limits &#34;Beyond The Sun&#34; DVD will be available, soon. Until then, this dvd satisfies, featuring a hair-raising version of Isaak's  &#34;Wicked Game.&#34;
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Once again I could not put this book down. Excellent story, characters and edge of your seat excitement.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008Y73940|5.0|Great movie. Not sure that I'd buy the blu-ray but it's certainly a great rental. Streaming from Amazon was great.
B009XWD02G|5.0|I am new at down loading music, my granddaughter showed me this app.  I have been down loading ever since. It is easy and quick.<br />Love it love it!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its very fun and will give you something to do for at least an hour unless your a real gamer and can go all day :)
B007IK44CK|5.0|This movie is better than the previous ones in that Tom Cruise is not the only action hero nor is the mission only left up to him but to his thrown-together team, who manages to make a great team with some humor. The gadgets and gear used in this movie are mind-blowing. The setting in the infamous Dubai hotel and the culture this movie brings is like a breath of fresh air. The movie poster showing him dangling by one electromagnetic glove after the other one quit working is a scene set in Dubai at the Dubai hotel, and even this scene isn't taken so seriously at one point. It's just a small piece of this must-see movie. :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is tons of fun! I play it everywhere! I love how the backgrounds and locations change every few weeks... It keeps things interesting!  Simple, but enjoyable. (:
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|What a wonderful adventure! I wanted to jump right in and ride along too! I really enjoyed reading this book!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly never fails with his old character, Harry Bosch.  His craggily character and<br />his old way detective methods leads us through an interesting case.  Bosch comes 'alive' once<br />again.
B008N1LL42|4.0|The best movie ever made based on strategy and defense.Rihanna play a great role on this movie. Also A great whoa for the navy seals
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I really did order this book by mistake.  I usually do not like Sparks' love stories.  This one had<br />an unusual ending and again another predictable love story.  I understand that they have<br />complete a film based on this story.....I will skip.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is an excellent read. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The ending was totally surprising. A very well developed story. It felt almost like a true account of being at sea.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|The pleasantness of this show has drawn me in. I find myself caring about the characters, and the writers have given us ample opportunity to meet them and find out about their lives. There is no gore, no sex, no swearing- most of our current culture probably finds this boring but I thoroughly enjoy it. The actors have familiar faces, one may recognize  Brendan Coyle, aka Bates from Downton Abbey and Julia Sawalha, who played the silly youngest sister Lydia Bennet, from the 1995 BBC version of Pride and Prejudice. I had never heard of this show, and thank Amazon Prime for introducing me. There are at least 4 seasons available!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|It has many twists and turns and lots of adventure.  With a lot of wanting to been top and leader Wantage.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|As a radio DJ this is only my 3rd aka 240 in 25 years of nearly daily use. They are still as comfortable as ever and after one week of breaking in sound nearly flawless.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Great movie about making a movie. Ben Affleck did a wonderful job of storytelling. The characters were very well cast. All around 5 Stars!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this is A GREAT game !!! Way better and cooler as well as funner than the regular temple run. It has many cool features
B0076DCT2G|3.0|To much filler at times bogs down the story.  Pretty predictable ending.  Even the usual John Corey dialogue seemed lacking.  Not one of the better ones.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|My 6 month old favorite movies. She loves Tinker Bell! Amazing buy for little girls. Thank you all so much for helping with a cranky baby
B009GEEMLY|1.0|This is the quintessential movie that relies on special effects over a substantive plot.  Waste of time in my opinion.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|So happy I had something. I could watch during the early hours of the morning at 4 am. Great, thanks again
B00B2EWNWG|1.0|it is terrible the acting is horrible-Russell crowe -have no idea what his part was and who he was. Was not advertised in Chinese with English subtitles. I watched 15 minutes and turned it off and wish I could receive a refund
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|So happy I had something. I could watch during the early hours of the morning at 4 am. Great, thanks again Hubby's favorite Hero!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This isn't a south seas island, and our protagonist doesn't sing opera. But one intrepid areonaut must survive on Mars, alone. It's enough to make even a clown cry. (Warning, some real science is discussed in this book, so beware.)

0525953728|5.0|This is really a great book and I wish everyone would get a chance to read it., Thanks for having this book when I wanted it.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Many friends told us how good this show was, finally we decided to watch it and have really enjoyed it
B007KW5N9Y|4.0|good classic family movie - lesson to be learned is that we're fools if we dont think this could happen in America.
B0012NVGHU|3.0|Glen Hansard is a powerful singer songwriter presence. But Marketa brings him to life and gives him wings. So the ending disappoints. The director attests they were going for simplicity in the movie and it shows throughout. Other than Hansard's constant moping about his ex, the only real emotion displayed in this film is in the songs. But they are too born in angst and sadness to be inspiring. I wish we could have seen more character development with these two. I never got the impression Marketa was in love enough with her absent husband to welcome him back. Despite Hansard's alluded success, they both seem so alone at the end of it. Sad.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Like this one even more than Cut The Rope. Great work. This game will be one to remember, that's for sure.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|This App is not easy to maneuver and really doesn't have much of what I was looking for. There must be better ones out there.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book was awesome. It keeps you on your seat wondering what she is going to say next. You find yourself crying and smiling at other parts and almost screaming out loud when something bad is going to happen. Overall though this is an awesome book!
B00AW8UK0K|2.0|What can you say about this book. This is the latest diet in the UK from the guy who made it popular on TV.<br /><br />Unfortunately it takes the format of many of these books. Give a tenuous link with something, then state the health benefits of that thing. There is very little on the science side that has been properly tested and reviewed as the continual references to a very few doctors will show.<br /><br />Having said that there is no doubt that as a diet it will work! If you eat 1.5 days worth of food per week, of coarse you are going to lose weight, and quite quickly.<br /><br />Lastly, I read this on a tablet and despite the ability to show graphics, none were included, so it was one very drab read. I have been told the main book is quite nicely illustrated. I should also add that this is also a very short read. If you skip through the recipes and pages and pages of testimonials (I did say that as a diet it would work), you can get through it in a couple of hours. Actually it may take a bit longer as I think I skipped through the pseudo science too!
B005HED11Y|5.0|I have always been a trekkie and in preparation to watch the new Star Trek film, I am rewatching all of the original series.  I loved the fact I could watch it all on Amazon and with Prime account it was free.  The quality was great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitare and this app is very challenging even lets me win once in awile. I don't like the ads especially the single ones wanting to know your age.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|its very cute and i like the message it sends to young kids. my three kiddos really really liked it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Was not as enjoyable as the first two. I didn't really understand why she did some of the things she ended up doing.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|A spin on majang. My husband installed on his phone and it's a little small and has crashed a few times but overall good.  I have it on the kindle and it is great. Fun spinning the cube. The attack mode is fun adding more and blocks with time but I prefer regular mode. The 3 year loves it but not getting a very good time the 9 year loves it
B000001F7R|5.0|who doesn't love the Def Lep?  Please.  this album rocks.  'nuf said.  Shipped on time and no damages.  Very good service as always.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Have watched this movie many times, and it just never gets old.  There are very few movies that I want to watch again and again, but this one is on that list.  It's a classic, at least at my house!
B005VPRDAY|4.0|Hey, we love these!  These were easy enough for my 4 year old princess to work on and fun and brightly colored.  Of course her older brother had to get in the mix too and show her how it was done, but she didn't need his help anyway!  Shipped on time, well packaged, all that I expect from Amazon.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It fun an great last level is hard and to beat tell me if you known how to bet it
B000001DVD|5.0|Starts off with let it rock, let it roll, and just goes on from there?  If you love the Def Lep, and who don't, then you'll love this album too!  Always superb service from Amazon.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|One less empty mansion in the Kingdom of Heaven. Eye opening perspective of Those who have chosen a profession to protect and defend the freedoms and rights of some who would disgrace this great United States of America. Although Kyle will never be known as s literary giant, this book puts you in his back pocket thru some extraordinary experiences. To all the Armed Forces, may God Bless each of you. This great country supports you and Thanks you for our freedom
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Another good read by Mitch Albom. I'm always amazed at how he can bring things together for a beautiful story.
1401937519|1.0|After seeing her, I'm beginning to think there are two Heavens; one called the real Heaven and the other \\"Heaven\\" called Hell. See, Satan is a counterfeiter, and his goal is to deceive people as he is a liar and a great deceiver. What better way to deceive one than to have them in a \\"near death\\" or \\"crossing over\\" experience, return and tell all. Lest we forget this is all done with God's permission, and in her-and so many others who say the same-to test genuine Christians rather or not to believe the person who \\"died\\".<br /><br />Dying to be me is a sad way of living, for each was birthed for a reason to do God's will on earth, not be \\"be me\\".  Satan tells all who will listen to \\"be yourself\\". Is that not what caused Satan to fall Heaven?<br /><br />The test/check I always do is after their \\"experience\\" is to watch their life after. Is it now God-centered with sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ and doing His will, or continuing in their former lifestyle..or an agenda in-between.<br /><br />If Heaven is real, and it is, the only one who go there are those that have truly accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. Satan will deceived one to believe they have actually gone to Heaven, when in fact they haven't; have instead gone to his \\"heaven\\" which is Hell. (I know I will get angry responses, but my goal is to help others see the true \\"Light\\" and not be deceived. To be deceived without warning is sad; to be deceived with warning is even sadder and my cost one their life!)
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I had read/heard such great things about this book and was so excited to get started. The excitement quickly ended, though, as I really struggled to both finish the book and connect with the characters. While I could excuse the &#34;beyond their years&#34; language as I do believe kids in these types of situations are forced to grow up so much faster than the average child, I found the love between them hard to believe. It really felt forced and unrealistic, especially given the limited contact the two of them had. And overall I felt that the book didn't have a good flow to it - the story was choppy, the characters were undeveloped and the story just never quite captured me.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The characters are intense and real life.  I cannot believe the hour is over already when each episode concludes.  Try it and you will see.  Not for the squeemish.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's great having a game that is like real life . I would recommend this app to ask my friend. Taylor Ech.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie and had to read the book there was a bit of difference but the book was better.<br />Harold
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love the app so much, it is awesome, u get to look at cool pics, and u can also meet awesome people
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Covers material that should be of interest to all senior married couples. I never though Tommy Lee could be funnier that Billy Crystal.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a really cute movie.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I don't have 9 more words that this survey requires!
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|This book held my interest from beginning to end, but that is true of all his books.  I am a real Nicholas Sparks fan.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I like the somewhat different take on the bak story of Green Arrow.  It has a good storyline and cast of characters.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|It's one of the simple solutions to better health and how to avoid all of the drugs that only are band aids instead of personal responsibility for your own health.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this program pretty much every day and have had no problems. It does what it said it would do and can recommend it without any reservations.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|an awesome action game that challenges one to fast movements and strategic defense.  Uses data so make sure your device has wifi or space.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I am enjoying the series - I'm only through the 4th episode of Season 1.  It's actually quite fascinating to feel emotions of empathy for the apparent terrorist.  I am eager to see how the characters develop.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works well and a smooth time passer game.  Great for filling some time when looking for something to do for a good ten or so minutes.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|she is a wonderful singer. enjoyed this CD that bought her 21 and waiting for the single to come out on her new CD
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is really fun to play.  you can give it to a little kid and they will have a ball playing with their. favorite my little pony characters. I love this game

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My husband and my child with autism both really enjoy playing angry birds and I enjoy that it is free
B002MQYOFW|5.0|couldn't put it down once I began, the best trilogy I have read in a long time.  characters are developed amazingly and you are completely invested in them all
B0057RCFQS|4.0|My son is into dinosaurs.  I'm so glad there is a trilogy on this.  So far so good! Came just in time for xmas!
B000FC12C8|4.0|I asked my Grandmother, what book would she suggest in learning to handle investments.  When there comes a time when you have to listen to your grandmother about money, which is the day you realize that she knows much more about our world, and your interests, than you thought.  You will want details.  Details that only a book can guide and history can attest to.  Insights into a broad picture, and the effect on the consumer.  This book handles the lesson based guidance very well.  It needs to be complimented by lighter material if you are just learning about the game.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|THE Worst POS excuse for a movie EVER! It was like a bad episode of Family Guy. What a piece of crap waste of time, thanks a lot Amazon, I'll never buy a movie from you again.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Great movie! Pixar doesn't only make movies for kids. Characters are captivating and entertaining. One of my favorite pixar movies.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Found this novel to be out of balance compared to other Clancy novels.  I have all of Clancy's previous novels and have always enjoyed them.  In this one, the &#34;bad Guy's&#34; were dominating the 1st 3/4 of the story.
B0086700CM|4.0|Choose this game because the grandkids saw another child playing it.  They really enjoy it and it keeps them quiet and busy.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Never played this brand of solitaire game before so<br />like the different method and challenge.  Good graphics<br />and easy to use.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Interesting story line.  More a story about survival than a senseless zombie flick.  The type of series that makes you think &#34;what if???&#34;
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game has proven to be a pleasant surprise.  Like ease of use,<br />graphics and multitude of options.  Have to fight wife for use.
B005XLN97M|4.0|My daughter loves this thing. It is her barbie vacation home. She has played with this house for hours st a time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is about the closest I have seen with the real life care of a horse.  My grand daughter loves this and I think this reinforces the caring, nurturing qualities she already has.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 1, episode 1 is some of the best television you can ever see, some of the best story telling best whatever category you want. Then the rest of the season slowly falls down into your typical heap that only wishful viewers will keep watching. Apparently they fired all those people who were behind the scene's and they made season 2. Certainly shows as it was back to being amazing. Season 3, as often times as it is violent is also perfect in it's violence. Never does the violence come unprovoked and never do you stop hoping to see someone live, or die, or both. Everything is fleshed out, and everything is painted into a corner with no other way out for survival except the hard way. Truly enjoyable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is well cast, the story lines are almost always well done, and the historical fiction aspect is highly appealing!
B008DKBO8G|5.0|This is wonderful in its simplicity. You just slide your Kindle in and close the velcro tabs, and its protected.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's The Walking Dead. What's not to love? And even better, I can access it on my PS3! So yay for me!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I loved the xfiles so its so great to watch a series online and know that I have 4 more seasons to go. Love the non-love story line between the main characters too. I'm sure it will develop into something though. I don't think you can make a sci fi film about government agents and not have it reference the x-files.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Absolutely love it!!! I love that it resembles an old book and it's cute too! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!
034580404X|5.0|i read all 3 books in two weeks. i was hooked and couldnt stop til i finished, it was hard to put it down, the end of each chapter left you hanging to where you wanted to start the next chapter.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This movie has to be the most incredible movie ever made! Big tear-jerker! If you read the book, the movie relates extremely close and is just as good as the book! BUY BUY BUY!
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This was a very good movie.  The scene where Denzel Washington landed the plane was riveting.  I would have given it 5 stars but I'm so sick and tired of the f word being thrown around in these movies.  It would be nice to watch a movie without all the bad language.  Otherwise, another excellent performance from Denzel.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Downloaded this app because I liked the Weather Channel, however the app is worthless, it is never up todate.  As an example; this is Monday and when I used it to get a weather update all the information is as of Friday.  All the other apps on my Kindle Fire worked fine.  Congradulations Weather Channel I no longer use your app or watch the Weather Channel. How can anyone expect you to run a television channel when you can't seem to manage a simple weather app.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  Not the sort of book, where you say &#34;I just couldn't put it down&#34;.  A gentle book, about mature people in difficult places, rediscovering the essence of their lives, and touching others in their journey. Humouress and thought provoking.  Happy to recommend this delightful book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a fun game and helps you improve your caring qualities. it is a very cool game to play!
B0018LMZOE|5.0|This is just a nostalgic trip back to the 60's.  Moody Blues are fantastic!  Great memories of a great band!

B008HK3XOU|5.0|this is a wonderful case for my kindle! it is everything I could have hoped forand more. Highly recommend buying this!
B0080M3OGW|2.0|I gave the movie 2 stars because of DeNiro & Streep. Had it been any other actors, I would have turned it off.<br />DeNiro's character was a happy man with a good marriage and children he adored. There was no motivation for him to stray, and there was no excuse for him doing so.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy all the variety In the games.  especially like the logic games.  great for passing the time.  I can never sit still so it is great to play while watching Tv.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel gives a superlative performance.  I would give him 10 stars.<br />I thought the movie was very good and very intense. I didn't relax during the entire film.<br />The subject matter is definitely a downer, but it is also a very important one.<br />Just don't choose this film when you're looking for something to raise your mood!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a good way to pass the time by. No complaints. For a free game its pretty fun. I would recommend this game to anyone trying to past the time by.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Had a knot on my stomach for 2 + hours, even when I knew the outcome. Great movie!! Glad I watched it before the Oscar's.
034580404X|5.0|This book is wonderful. You'll learn a lot from it and its amazing. Very informational. I love it and recommended to everybody.
1400052181|3.0|Good story, but all the scientific parts was way beyond me.  Read it for a book club review.  Would probably not have selected it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's been a shockingly story to read and know that it is possible that what was written in this book can happen in real life. It's good to stay alert in you're surroundings in order to help anyone in need.
B002APU580|5.0|My favorite Jane Austen movie BY FAR, and the picture quality on BluRay is impeccably clear, must buy for sure!
B0040HO01Y|4.0|I like the simplicity this series brings and the scenes are set in a beautiful setting.  Actors do very well.
1423165691|4.0|Good book, bigger than I anticipated. Only draw back as another reviewer noted, is work is unattributed. Other than that, it's awesome!
0765325950|4.0|A Memory of Light ends the series. That's it. That's all I can say for it. Well, I can say a LITTLE more.<br /><br />At 900+ pages, AMoL is a Liviathan. The Last battle is here, and it's not pretty. Without spoiling anything, the people who die, the way they die, and the way those deaths are presented, often surprised me. Cities burn, armies fall, and all worlds stand in the balance.<br /><br />To go a little more in depth, the plot is good, the characters are adequate, and Mat is literate. So, a decided improvement over Towers of Midnight.<br /><br />One of the best payoffs in the book is the Great Captains, and the General who ends up leading the armies of the Light. The game of chess between the forces is some of the best fantasy has to offer, and feels exactly like the war we've waited twenty years to see.<br /><br />On the other hand, while the buildup and the sustained action is satisfying, I found very little to be pleased about in the resolution. Yes, this is the ending RJ intended, in a sense. But the execution feels so foreign to Jordan's that it seems like particularly well-written fan fiction. Sanderson does the best he can with what he has to work with, but to those of us who fell in love with Jordan's prose, characterization, and plotting, nothing else could satisfy.<br /><br />In addition, Sanderson's writing leans on the fourth wall with a constancy that rips at the suspension of disbelief and often sends us tumblign down into Narm. Epic Fantasy, by definition, takes itself, its world, and its characters seriously, and by inserting meta-jokes and reerences, even minor ones, you undermine the story.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I Like Brandon Sanderson as a writer and as a person. I believe he was the best person for the job. In fact, if I were to treat this as a standalone book, or just compare it to the other RJ/Sanderson Wheel of Time books, it would hold up well. It's unique, largely thought-out, mostly internally cohesive, fulfills many of its promises, and delivers a climax of climaxes. But that would be unfair, both to the Wheel of Time series at large and to A Memory of Light in particular.<br /><br />As I finished the last page, I felt exhausted by the journey, as all good fantasies leave me. But I also felt hollow and sad. I felt that it was not really an ending, but a more organized and detailed set of notes for the ending. In this way, A Memory of Light is an eternal, appropriate tribute to Robert Jordan.<br /><br />We miss you, Jordan. No one can replace you. Thank God no one tried.promises, and delivers a climax of climaxes.

B0002DKCMG|4.0|Lots of topless girls, so it wasn't a complete waste, but not Michelle.<br />The guys made it a lot better.  They were very funny.<br />But...<br />I bought it because Michelle Trachtenberg was in it.
