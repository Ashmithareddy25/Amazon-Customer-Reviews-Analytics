B006RD9A1Y|5|If you find a good body to fit it is really fancy and charming dress for nights. you can enjoy having it with good delivery
B00FEC2K34|5|My favorite pair.of.lounge around pants.
B004O4JKJK|5|Well designed and the additional flap for the ID was exactly what I was looking for.  Holds all my credit cards very nicely and appears to be well made with nice tight stitching.  the credit card slots are a bit snug but I expect this will become less of an issue.
B00B2G3512|5|My daughter loves this dress, and can't wait to wear it!  I bought a size bigger than she is, in the hopr that she gets more wear out of it!
B001J65LR6|5|The flash has been my favorite Super hero since I was a small child and now that I am grown up nothing has changed. Great quality shirt and fits me perfect. The logo is not cheaply made and I would buy again. Quick shipping as well.
B00B2JD37K|4|Calvin Klein Sportswear Men's<br />Great Quality is great and at the price it is a good deal<br />but I found it a bit small
B00DDPGI8C|5|If you have an athletic or slightly bulked body then this t-shirt is for you. It fits great and is made of a very good quality. The Hurley graphic is very nice and does not wash off or deteriorate.... at least so far anyway. Very pleased, just bought another one in black which is what prompted me to write a quick review.
B0068OMC9Y|5|The more I wear this jacket the more I like it. I am near 5 foot 9 and around 176 pounds of solid build (go to gym) and the medium fits perfectly. I like my clothes to be nice and fitted and this is perfect in that regard, fitted but not too tight that you cannot bend down to tie your shoelaces. Being a bit shorter Iike the fact that the length finishes just below my belt.<br /><br />The jacket is very well made and you can tell by the substantial zip that it is not going to fall apart anytime soon. Material is very good and a lot more solid than looks in picture - was expecting something thinner and more lightweight, so was very pleased.<br /><br />Very modern looking, well put together with quality material, goes with everything, very nice fitted sizing without being too tight, good length for me and great price.
B000J41P1U|1|This dickies pant was horrible. I don't know where to start, but I paid a lot of money for the delivery but it didn't happen as expected. When I got the pant oh my Lord, the left side is twisted...talk about poor quality, I got it, so I said &#34;common whats next&#34;, yet I still wore it because I need a uniform for work even if its ugly well the pants is lent catcher...holly molly...
B00DHH8U5K|5|Purchased for the significant other. Was tired of looking at those plain beige bra's, so I wanted to find something with a little pizzazz. This did the trick. She likes the way it fits and I like the way it looks.
B00GB01U66|5|Didn't realize it, but the cargo pockets have a drop in pocket behind it that's absolutely perfect to slide in a 7&#34; tablet. Works great to carry my iPad mini or Nexus 7.
B004XYJZQ4|4|My son wears a size 7 shoe and these are a bit big and bulky for him now, but I figure they'll last a little while.
B008ETZHO8|5|I am very content with the purchase of these jeans. They are so comfortable; they have stretch! I am almost 5'8&#34; and the length was perfect, right past ankle. The Paige brand came highly recommended from my friend. I had received great boots for Christmas, but only had boot-cut and straight-leg pants. The quest to find skinny and slim jeans meant that I had to splurge on a pair of quality brand; I haven't spent this kind of money on jeans before. My theory is quality over quantity; a quality product always has a great warranty (in my experience).
B005TS4SJC|1|When I had ordered this, I had not realized it ran small. There were no reviews for this. I barely could get it over my thighs and I'm a size 8. I ordered a 10, thinking that if I did, it would cover me well, but boy was I wrong! Sadly, this is going back....
B00CMOBKJC|5|I love the bright color and the belt.  I usually wear a large but ordered an x-large. I've worn in light rain with no problem.  The is NO lining so it can get a little sticky when you sweat. I also like the button at the rist.
B003S899P8|1|This is a very Dissapointing Purchace, I bought the white ones and they had black lint, fur falling out evrywhere, very cheaply made... the best way to make these last i may sound crazy but turn them inside out hair spray the back of them let them air dry for awhile then comb gently the fur thats falling out on the back... and then comb the front
B00DHQR278|5|excellent article very comfortable as the seller described it
B00AE1SK2K|4|I have had a hard time finding inexpensive nursing bras for plus-size women.  I took a chance on these and am pleasantly surprised. They are comfy and supportive enough to wear out of the house.  They are also cute, but I think the fit is a tad bit small.
B00MF0S3KW|5|Even the size is bit big for me but i still love it, very light and feel warm, good quality too. considering if buy 1 more different color...
B00INU7IRC|5|Cute! Cute! Cute!!!!
B008X279R4|5|They fit perfectly
B00Q5TL252|3|The color was a little off and it was very roomy.
B00NG2Y3HU|5|very warm, excellent choice
B009I3Z6JA|5|This costume is the bomb. Check the size chart and you should be ok. I was borderline between two size/weight combos so I went with the smaller of two and it was perfect--they stretch. I was really afraid it wouldn't look like the picture but it matched to a tee! The Silver REALLY is as shiny as shown in the picture! This is a big concern online since some of the other manufacturers don't match the material correctly to the pic. They delivered faster than many of the other distributors based in China, and worth a slightly extra cost for speed. Those sometimes can take a month to deliver, I paid extra to have it in 3-5 days.
B0083QBIRC|5|The costume runs large. I read reviews and was expecting that, though,  so I ordered a smaller size than I normally would. It fit great. I got lots of compliments on the costume and think it was a great value. The only thing I could complain about is that a button fell off when I wad wearing it,  but that is an easy fix.
B00A6MZHL4|5|it comes wrapped up like a present. This top fits great, and i love how it is nice and long. i get many complements. holds up well after wash. no problem with wrinkling.  very elegant. i would recommend and have purchased other items by Patty and love all of them.
B00B845VRO|5|It has geographical coordinates n 45° 42' 26&#34;, e 11° 30' 40&#34; (you can even see it in picture)<br />Coordinates show a place somewhere in Italy. In the yard of local lumber supply.<br />What kind of message are they trying to send?
B002VLZH22|3|The material is kinda low quality and its rough against skin, but beside that it makes a cool gym short and it has pockets
B00SFN3XHQ|4|Beautiful color. I'm a size 8 and a medium is a wonderful fit
B00EPDXR2G|5|I bought this dress in mocha and while the color is lighter than in the picture, it is still quite lovely.  I am 5'2' and typically wear anywhere from a size 10 to 12, for reference.  This dress fits me perfectly and falls to the very top of my feet.It is low cut in the front, but not too severe.  The coils help to change the amount of cleavage shown.  It has full coverage in the back.  The material is very soft and comfortable, but can easily be dressed up with the right shoes and jewelry.  A very good purchase, especially for the price and I would certainly recommend it.
B007PARVT6|3|I love almost everything about this jacket. It's smooth and durable on the outside, yet soft to the touch on the inside. However, my only and greatest complaint is I ordered a medium (i should've gotten a small) and the tag (as well as the size of this clothing) say its XXL.... Umm.... I think this can really have an effect on my buying choice for this company...
B00G6DNTB2|5|Fits really well and looks great. Its much warmer than it appears. Worth every penny!!! Happy Customer!
B00OZ8USQY|5|Wow!  This scarf is almost too good to be true.  It is so beautiful and fancy.  The material is stretchy too.  I had to order 2 more in black & purple.  You have to see it to believe it.  The peacock itself is velvet.
B00KDJ7M7W|5|EXCELLENT
B00BX2PE8W|4|However, otherwise it is just as I expected. I will keep it and wear it; it'll probably stretch out somewhat with wear.
B00IZMVY82|4|I LOVE the suit but wish it was a tiny bit bigger.  I have a lot of swimsuits but these seem to run a bit smaller than expected.  Guess I'll be eating a few more salads and veggies.  Lol!!
B005978KGA|5|Feels great. Got med/large size and fits just right. 3inches above ground. Not really a dry off bathrobe. It feels like microfiber blanket. Its a modified snuggy. An awesome , done right, very warm , star wars snuggy.
B00MUT4BY0|5|my niece just loved her princess dresses
B00SF4P2YW|5|my grandson wears them when he is running track...he loves them
B00NFZSCOI|5|Excellent price for this dress!
B00LKKW2TQ|5|This pajama was purchased as a gift for a 5'4.. thin framed female.  The  sizing was large but that is the concept of the style. The face and tail were quite cute and provided an entertaining time.  The thick fleece makes it prefect for a winter evening, though it would be far too hot in the summer or spring.
B00CM4YUMQ|5|I bought this for my grandson who is on the large size.  He loves it!  Fits great!  He wears a 3X and that is what I ordered.
B000UVSN6W|1|First of all the belt isn't black, its dark brown.<br />Second off the belt isn't &#34;100% Genuine Bonded Leather&#34;, its a cheap leather strip with a coating over it that wore off in 1 month, I don't even wear this every day and it looks so ratty that I am going to end up throwing it away already. This was a complete waste of money and I am thoroughly disappointed, I have a Kenneth Cole reaction belt that is reversible black and brown that I've worn for probably 2 years now and is in similar shape as this one. I'll never buy Perry Eillis again.
B00DQZ9KPM|5|Great jacket, great price!
B0000CBXFT|4|I bought this bra to wear under my wedding dress. I ordered a size smaller because of the other reviews. It fit ok. I wasn't so thrilled/looking forward to wearing it though. So I ended up going to a lingerie store where a sale consultant pick out the same bra (in a bigger size) and hemmed it to fit my body. It made a difference and I was happy on my wedding day. Love this bra but I recommend getting it a speciality store so you know your getting the right size.
B00PLRZ4A8|5|This is an adorable outfit! I purchased matching dresses for my daughters and they are beyond cute and they fit perfect!
B00IHPLHKM|2|Too small
B005GPKW98|5|Great fit.
B00RDFERK4|5|Very pleased. I received them within 5 days of purchasing. Haven't tried them on yet, but they look great of quality. Will order again and highly recommend
B00WH59GPQ|3|Love the color but the zipper was damaged! Soooo disappointed!!!!!! I had to return it. I did not even get to try it on for size. DISAPPOINTED I like the color and style
B00E9R0EVK|4|Thank you, this is nice.
B0091DO0L2|4|I really like the color of these but the fit is a bit small. I like the thickness of the straps and the material for working out.
B00AWLXEFU|5|😊
B0057XBFAO|4|The shirts were just what my husband needed. He washed them and they seem to be fitting ok. Thanks
B00IOCZ8FS|5|Very beautiful, well-fitted dress. My daughter used it for a pumpkin patch pageant and it was perfect!
B007U7RNMY|3|I thought these are extra long for my 4 ft. 11 in size--don't think I will purchase these again.  My usual thigh highs were Hanes brand and they fit much better
B00H86SPEW|4|It arrived in 2 days, new, in package. Beautiful jacket, feels well constructed. It is a heavy material, so, I'll be wearing that when it is a bit cooler here in Florida. CR
B008EQQN3A|5|Nice, great quality.
B00BYOEIUY|5|Love this shirt!
B00817DW8Q|5|as expected.
B0038SONQI|5|great fit and great service
B0066SJMO0|5|My son loves his Fedoras, and this one looks amazing.  He is 19, and this is his favorite hat.  The fit is perfect, and he has received many compliments.  So glad I found this gem.
B00EQQU220|3|its big for my size
B00SQFLPOG|5|Wonderfully darling! Want more!
B00DDLTO96|5|My 11 lb. daughter has a habit of kicking socks. I'm pleased to find the Osh Kosh socks to fit her little feet perfectly and stay put! The title of this product says it is for boys, but we got the same ones as pictured. I like the fact that aside from pink socks, there's also 2 pure white ones and 1 gray/white one so I can use them with her non-pink outfits.
B00CONNGVQ|1|Just got two of this product and I can tell it is NOT ORIGINAL. Neither the package or the waist cincher have the name Ann Chery on it and it is from China. Also it is not made with látex as it's supposed to be. I'm completely frustrated with this purchase. Beware! Fake product!
B004TPM0CS|5|Very pretty!
B00H2BFU46|2|short, and see through  not flattering and looks nothing like the picture,
B004FSAQCK|5|This dress is comfortable, sexy, and is really easy to pair with accessories. I always get compliments on it (I have the black and the white ones). You can wear it on it's own, or hook it up with earrings, a necklace and bracelets. Granted, you can't spread your legs very far, so dancing can sometimes be a little of a challenge, but still worth it. Oh, the material is a teeny bit stretchy, which just ads to the comfort I think.
B00501B63Y|4|As usual you can never buy a costume and have it look as good  as the picture shows, but it fits well enough. It's not too tight and not too baggy. It is really thin material, but the 'vest' that comes down below your crotch is sufficient to cover up the hubby's junk. ;)
B00UDCWZ0I|5|Great shirt and it's a fit on me...
B001O9BEKQ|5|I am 5'7\\" 230lbs.Ordered XL and they fit great. Always wore Friut of the Loom or Hanes and they fit OK except they never covered my balls all the way and the band would get stretched out.Dockers material feels better and the band is better. Dockers does have more material to cover the fellas! They do come up higher than I am used to (pulls up to belly button)but I'm older and bigger now so extra coverage is a good thing.<br />They remind me of the wife's grannie panties type....you know like a granpa manties(HA HA). They are very comfortable. So if your thong/bikini days are past you and your fellas don't feel right in boxers than these are for you...come on give your balls the support they need.
B000V6X6I6|5|The item is beautiful, it fits well it did get squashed a bit during shipping but all I did was lay it out and fluff it a bit. It's going to look great with my other costume pieces.
B00K0NGR2M|5|Love it !!!
B00115BL4W|5|hubby loved them would buy again
B00EOV1D3E|5|i love it- def. recommend.
B001JBH16A|4|GOOD PRODUCT
B004HH45B2|3|It is OK. Not a substantial quality in feel. Elastic seems to be a bit too loose. But then it is not that expensive either.
B00RBYOYBE|5|Great product runs small
B003B7IE7U|4|good
B00FI9S7JO|5|Looks as sexy as we expected. She loves the way it made her feel as well as how comfortable it was
B00AAQ11DY|5|Love it!!!. If you want to look sexy for you hubby for a special night, this will do the job he won't be able to take his eye off you. I recommend it.
B00LTTLXIE|5|Well tailored fit.
B004TERJ7K|5|I love this!
B007BZ5J08|3|The shirt is ok... a bit thin and definitely on the tight side. Normally an XL is a comfortably loose on me. This is SNUG. I'm ok with keeping it, but not to wear to the same places I originally intended.
B00IEZNKFA|1|Disappointing - this &#34;one fits all&#34; item was not what I would have hoped it to be - as a tall- framed woman I know I'm pushing it with cheaper teddies, but this piece is definitely meant for women heights 4 ft - 5 ft.  Anyone above 5 ft tall I would say...don't buy! Fits wrong as a result of the height issue.<br /><br />Too bad, but hey, it is a cheap buy and if you purchase it just so your partner can rip it off of you (ooh la-la) then it filled  a fun purpose all the same, didn't it?! :)
B003VFK9PC|3|The t's are cut perfect...tapered, slim fit, long and finished well.  The downside is that the material is very cheap cotton that most probably will not stand up to a lot of laundering.  If they were going to make the shirt with a thin material I wish they had used a cotton/lycra blend.  As they are I am satisfied with them and they do actually feel and look great under a dress shirt.  How long they last remains to be seen.
B00BQA78UI|5|Good price, good quality
B007BBTJWG|1|Ladies do we really need a pair of $30.00 underwear. Please and they are made in China, nothing against the people of  China. What is the mark-up on Kenneth Cole underwear? You can call them anything you want they are still underwear.
B002GOWBTQ|5|ST. Patrick's day attire
B00CIZNBFQ|3|Have to lose weight to wear it, unfortunately, which is probably a good idea anyway!
B00505GOHI|4|Good product. Fits well.
B00GU05SCE|5|It fits as expected and is comfortable too! Would definitely recommend it.
B00KDXSKJ2|5|very nice
B00IE1PZA2|4|good
B004A7YLPY|3|It's a nice design but the pockets aren't a consistent size. The inside flap can just barely hold credit cards in them.
B00HESSXGE|5|Good
B009KODKY0|4|Fits right for my wife who is 4'11 tall. It goes a little long though for her but that's fine.
B0018SFE2W|5|I needed this mask in a hurry and it arrived amazing fast, exactly as pictured. I used it in a skit and it worked out pefectly. Previously, I had ordered from another place that sent a different mask from the one I had ordered. One that was totally useless to me. They weren't around long enough for me to send it back. Guess they were online only for the halloween season. I was so thankful when my Amazon order came and it was exactly what I had ordered because time was getting very short. Great job AMAZON.com.                                                      Joy B.
B000H24JJ4|4|Delivered very promptly.  Workmanship seems very good.  I use it to walk our dogs (4 of 'em) and keep spare leashes, poop bags, etc., all together so I can grab and go.
B006X13B5G|5|Girls shouldn't have sweaty feet, right? Well I sorta do. It's not such a big deal in the summer, but when your feet get damp in the winter, that moisture makes them *cold*. And I hate cold feet! These socks are my favorites. They aren't high end wicking socks, but they do a good job of keeping my feet warmer and drier than other similar type socks and they're really comfy.
B001G824TK|5|They fit great and look great. The feel is like a brushed material.
B00DGLUQGI|1|I was extremely disappointed with this dress. I bought it for a wedding this weekend. When the dress arrived, I tried it on to make sure it fit and it did. I tried it on yesterday again just to be sure and as I was zipping the dress, the zipper snapped in two. I tried to return the dress and was told that it was passed the return window. I wasted the money on a dress that I now have to pay to fix and I am in a bind searching last minute for a dress to wear to a wedding.
B008VARBKS|5|Love them, bought more.<br /><br />Comfortable, well fitting, great kick around shorts for baseball, hiking, yard work, the symphony.
B000A0OVXC|4|they are just a bit high waisted or they'd be perfect.  still will order more though as they are at a great price
B005P269VC|5|My wife has a small breast size which is no problem at all accept for the fact that we can not find any bras that fit her unless we look in the kids section at Wal-Mart. We have tried looking at numerous amounts of web sites that have her size but the prices are outrageous $50-$60 dollars for one bra and sometimes even more. I have been looking for a bra that fits and has more of a sex appeal then kid stars and hearts and this one not only fits the bill it won't break the bank either. As soon as my wife saw this bra come in the mail said it was her new favorite bra. She loves it!
B009SDU20S|4|couple stones fell off as soon as I received it, but in general the mask was fine.
B005LAFQI0|3|Let me explain the review title, because I may be correct or incorrect.<br /><br />I bought what looks like the same Tommy Hilfiger Boatneck in Mar-shells a few months ago.  The logo is red, and the material was a very soft cotton.<br />This shirt doesn't feel as smooth, because the fabric  has small ribs in it.  The logo is dark blue.  The fabric is not as durable.<br /><br />I usually do not wear T. Hilfnger clothes, so maybe the logo on the large size is blue and on the 1X (bought at Mar-shels)  is red.  Does TH ever change his logo colors?  Maybe the one I bought at Mar-shels was a pajama top and this is not meant to be a pajama.  I can not explain why the shirts are different when they look alike.<br /><br /> I have not washed the Amazon one yet, so don't know how it comes out after washing.<br /><br />I should have bought two from the store.  It was of better quality than this one, although more expensive by $6.  But I'm keeping it because it is lightweight and I need another as a pajama top (I wear sleeveless in the summer and short-sleeved pajama tops in the winter) and short sleeves pj tops without pants are hard to find in the winter.
B00RW26KTE|4|nice model, nice color, but it runs a little larger.
B0061FHJ84|2|not what i wanted at all im going to say the shorts shipping and the price was very good just not what i was thinking i wanted
B001KXKMI6|5|Could not believe a price of less than $10 for such a well-made and sharply-tailored Men's extended size blazer. It looks sharp on my 6'5\\" son home from college. Speedy delivery, too.
B00DZS1P5I|1|Horrible. Just horrible.
B0040U2RMA|5|This is a good quality, heavy T-shirt.  Already washed it twice and still looks good. Got the XL for my son who is 6'3&#34; and over 200 lbs and fits him great.
B00JGHF2UQ|5|this was a gift
B00FXNJUG4|4|IT'S BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT'S GIGANTIC!!!!!!
B00O5VT4VQ|1|Where to start . . . This is pink, not beige.  The sleeves are different than pictured.  The under shirt is a spandex material that is not flattering at all.  They top across the collar was sewn incorrectly so it would create a weird line anytime you move your arms.  Its very poorly made and not worth the money.
B000ZF0KO6|5|If you are a fan you know what browncoat means. The t-shirt fits as expected the graphics are just as they appear on line and the material of the t-shirt is of medium weight and soft. It is a great t-shirt for me.
B00CBWZ7QW|1|Way small
B00OA5AK88|5|I bought this for my grandbaby and she is kinda short so we used the top for a dress and she looks amazing in it.  The colors are really bright. I love it.
B00J504408|3|Not as pretty as the picture for the price..........
B002SQI2AY|5|J'ai &eacute;tais tr&egrave;s satisfait de cet article de tr&egrave;s bonne qualit&eacute; pour le lavage &agrave; la main le retourner et  utiliser une poudre pour linge d&eacute;licat et le repassage &agrave; l'envers pour ne pas abîmer le motif.<br />comme toujours AMAZON respecte leur d&eacute;lai de livraison.
B00084Y7NY|4|Needed a yellow t shirt for a Halloween costume and this one did the job.
B00B9X4XQO|1|Def. worth $1.88..lol.. runs small, poorly made and looks cheap. Too good to be true. However it is worth the price I paid.
B00MPWFSOE|5|Perfect
B007T6TZO0|5|This skirt is so beautiful! It' so comfortable and you don't have to wear a slip because it's lined! It will keep you cool on a hot summer day.
B00FJIZDC8|5|Awesome!  Love the shirt, and the fit!  It's both cute and comfy!  The color looked as pictured and I received several compliments!
B008EQO8LY|4|I bought it to wear under a skirt, fits  as expected not really slimming just smoothing.
B00DX4GIGK|3|Pants were sold as 36 waist, however they appeared to be something closer to a small 35 fit-wise. In addition, the pieces of fabric were different shades, where the front of the legs are lighter and the backs of the legs are darker. The contrast is very definable since those different shades meet at the seams. The price was so cheap, no point in sending them back. Other than the different shades of material and the small fit, they do seem fairly well assembled and not as cheaply made as the price would suggest.
B0036ZU8UI|5|I needed a full 1 3/4 belt to take up the entire belt loop and keep my pants from rolling over the top of the belt. This is a heavy, kind of matte black, very clean belt. For a bigger guy, it's likely what you are looking for. Further, It also supports and distributes the weight of the Ruger .45 ACP on my hip without pulling the belt down, which is not really possible with a smaller belt.  I would definitely do this again. VERY GOOD heavy duty belt.  Read the sizing information, it works best if you measure your good fitting belt as suggested. (From where the buckle meets the leather, to the HOLE YOU USE.
B00AREJJ4M|4|Love the color variation on this shirt, it's unique.  Good quality stitching, very comfortable, cool to the skin, and very easy on the eyes.
B003CIYOHW|4|A little big around the shoulders and chest area, other than that it was great.
B003IBIEBU|4|Fit well as I expected.
B00B79M87G|1|I thought it would be strectchable but it hardly streches so I need a bigger size. Requesting a bigger size if possible??..
B00BOM21NW|1|Panties are cut smaller then expected are very uncomfortable for along period of time. If you purchase this product get the panties a extra size larger. J
B007JTYSFS|5|The 'girls' are happy positioned front and center, no under-arm spill. Totally comfortable well-fitting, excellent shaping. I don't like the current rounded style shaping, too matronly-looking. I want to see the model's profile so I'd know what I can expect, can't envision that in the straight-on view.
B0009VOATM|5|This is my second time buying this bra. I love it because it is firm yet cotton so breathable. A great support bra so you don't have wardrobe malfunction.
B00C81OQGS|5|Look decent and can be worn in business setting or factoryfloor
B0083EZDS4|5|This shirt is as advertised.  I can't wait to show off my flag on the weekend! Be sure to order one today!
B002TISDEG|4|A nice and comfortable ugly Holiday sweater.
B00NB4L91G|5|GREAT fit and feel... looks awes9me.. very happy with the purchase
B001JPP0GE|4|nice and cool for the summer.  works great as a night-time shirt.
B00KG52Y4Y|4|These jeans fit very well and at a great price.  I would have given them 5 stars except there is too much stitching on the back pockets.  I would have purchased a pair with a plainer pocket if I could have found them in the cut.  Overall, love them.
B00CYQ8XWA|5|The inside is roomy, outside is stylish.  The drop is good.  I would have liked a few more inches, but it works fine.  I really like the light colored interior, it makes finding things much easier than searching around in a black hole.
B005ZOJ4DK|3|I usually order big so I did the same this time but it isn't big at all.  So the larger man watch out cause the sizing isn't correct.  Already had a logo put on so it can't go back which is a bummer but at least it does fit somewhat but not really comfortable.
B004IWCHW0|5|This is what I will be wearing under my wedding Gown.. I love them!!!! I would recommend these to other!!! Give them a try
B004JV6JEM|5|My daughter looked so cute for her birthday party.
B00J2N0D4O|5|Is exactly what I wanted, arrived just when it should and super comfortable.
B00DFVWOZ0|2|This is actually lingerie re-packaged as a coverup.  came with a g-string...bit of a surprise when I found it lodged in my sofa later (didn't see it when I opened the package... had a funny chat w/ my husband!)  Generally, this isn't a bad item, though it's not as loose as it appears in the photo (order larger than your size if you want it to drape as would work best for swimwear coverup).  It is very polyester.
B00EIQUFFW|5|Great saying and nice and warm
B004UUHCDE|5|This was the perfect costume for my 3 year old.  She was able to dress warm (turtleneck and pants) and this fit nicely over it all.  The hat stayed on as well.  She wears a 3T and this was perfect with room to wiggle and not be too loose.  Not sure if she could fit it next year so may consider a size up if your child is larger than a 3T.
B000WBL15K|5|This shawl is a nice size, large enough to cover the shoulders.  It is warm enough to take off a chill, and looks very nice.  The colors are vibrant, and wearing it makes me feel fancy!
B00MZMSKTE|5|I love!!!!
B00D00J0US|4|They fit well and don't slip.  My daughter likes them better than any other liners she has tried. Comfortable and sturdy.
B0009GE1DW|5|The shirt is excellent!!! washes well and keeps it true color... I brought my son Five of them for his job so he would look good. well worth price..
B000H6ACN2|1|WHITE POCKETS?????  Even if they are big on you the white pockets stick out...  Very disappointed.
B008KL9TXU|3|The strap buckles were difficult to unfasten. They felt very &#34;cheap&#34; in quality. The fit was less than satisfactory compared to the Utility kilts I purchased from Damn Near Kilt me. I had high hopes because it looks great but when I put it on it was very disappointing. I didn't expect much for the  26 plus dollars I spent. Now I know why a kilt of this nature costs 2-800 dollars. I've kept it hoping I could make it work...
B000J45N2C|2|The first day I started wearing these I felt something poking into the top of my thigh... it turned out to be a bulky spot at the bottom of the seam.  There is a bunch of fabric there that I've never seen before in a Hanes panty and it's quite uncomfortable.  I wonder if they have someone new making them?!  The seams have always been flat before.  I'm going to try and cut the extra fabric and hope that it doesn't make the panty come apart.  I would not buy these again.
B00IMOG1CW|1|Bad, Too Small
B004XYAHLG|5|No problems with this bra or any of Wacoal's bras.  Holds my girls perfectly and is SO comfortable.  Definately worth the price!
B00EB7WG8M|2|Well my friend bought this same purse off of here, and the strap broke on it. So she hot glued it back on right, the next week it was broken again....so she gave the purse to me. Now the purse is just sitting on my floor boken still. I wouldn't recommend this purse....but hey you might have better luck then us. Just saying.
B00PZG68X2|5|This onesie is awesome. We ordered them for a girls cabin weekend and the quality is great for the price.  Like a yummy sweatshirt!  Definitely runs on the small side so order a size up.
B001LY2UK2|4|Very cute shirt for the big brother.  It fits smaller than the size though so buy a size or two up.  We bought this and took pictures as our way to announce to everyone that we were having our second baby.  Everyone love it and it made him feel special to wear his big brother shirt.
B0032Z7TKO|5|She looked just adorable on her birthday.
B00K44JLCU|2|Very dissatisfied, The costume looks cheap for how expensive it is, the wig is very different from that shown in the photo, is a disaster looks like a wig used
B00TLQ48OI|5|I bought this dress in pink color and its just awesome, very pretty and classy with lovely crochet. I got so many compliments, when I wore this dress. The fit is also perfect. Overall awesome buy!!!
B00F3LD2TC|1|VERY VERY BAD QUALITY,AND THEY HAVE FACTORY ERROR,EVERYTHING FALLS OUT !!!!!!
B001KU9QX6|5|Excellent A++++
B00L99RE00|5|I love it very beautiful! thank you
B004LZBURC|5|Are you incredibly conceded?  Do you live in LA, or NY?  Do you think your crap don't stank?  Is there a general air of... oh I don't know entitlement about you?  Do you think that everyone owes you something?<br /><br />THEN THIS HAT IS FOR YOU!<br /><br />Man, I gotta tell you, after my gf decided she wanted me to wear this thing... my whole life has changed... my poop, LOST it's smell... I mean, just gone... out of here man!<br /><br />Now, instead of being nice to people, I EXPECT everyone to OWE me something... and it's a good feeling...<br /><br />When it rains outside, I wear this and it blocks the water... I don't know how it works, but I think I am so perfect now that rain doesn't want to mess me up!<br /><br />Okay in all seriousness this is a good little beanie... not quite long enough though to &#34;sag&#34; off your head though... but it'll keep your head toasty, and your heart happy...although I don't know what that has to do with anything... ANYWAY... it's awesome.
B0040EYABW|5|This is a high quality bag. Prior to purchasing this bag, I purchased the Seattle Sports XL vinyl mesh bag - and there is no comparison between the two products. For just a little more expense, the Watershed Tramp is twice as nice of product. The mesh is heavy and high quality, the seams are well stitched, and the bag is huge, easily able to fit two kayak life jackets and two sets of broken down paddles.<br />I read a review before I purchased this bag about someone who had used this for their airline luggage and the bag ripped out.  Seeing the product, you can understand that this is not the best application for the product, this is a water sports bag.  I would not subject the mesh material that the bag is constructed from to a rotating bag delivery belt that eats my suitcase for lunch.  But for kayak and boating applications - this thing is tough, and it will let your things dry out so that they don't get a smelly or moldy.<br />I would recommend this bag without hesitation.
B00551ORSK|4|Like the wider straps.  I found that this bra fits me well.
B007UM6OXI|5|Just a little to long, but I did order med. length. Will just hem then. Like the fit and am thinking about ordering another pair.
B00W8EYTFS|5|I love this skirt! It's soft and cool. Not see through. I'm 5'6, 150lbs and have long legs. I usually wear an 8 tall. This skirt comes to my ankles. I'm planning on buying more from this seller.
B00HR10V6S|4|Incredibly comfortable, but the long/rollover waistband could fit a little better. It could just be the fit on me, but I think I'm going to have it taken in a little bit to stay up. It will be worth it for pants this comfortable!
B00GPSC78E|3|doesn't quite feel secure on my head<br />easily moves around. I would have liked it more secure on my head.
B00HSFTRM2|1|This dress is cut strangely and fitsv oddly in the bodice.  It's Great material and generally love Johnny was design.
B003MRTQ12|5|After browsing around, I finally settled on this item. I'm glad I did! It's warm, isn't itchy, and is super comfortable. I got a large instead of an adult small because I like extra baggy hoodies. I'd recommend this to others.
B00G28IV4G|3|They're a little tighter than you'd expect in the toes, but otherwise work as expected.
B00I5KUK16|4|Material is really soft, fits pretty loose but overall well. Good buy!
6094067339|4|Good for the price.  Very usable for performance.
B000J407NW|5|perfect fit but need to not put 2 of same color in a pack
B00JL7BWLE|5|I bought this for my friend as a graduation gift. I got it in the mail today and she tried it on . It fits her perfectly !
B00N50MJQU|3|Not very well made. These are also supposed to fit an adult male. most men have large or xlarge hands. These gloves fit me snugggly and I only wer a medium glove.These gloves are also not very well made.
B0083VPSYG|4|What can I say.  I wanted a denim shirt and I got a good quality denim shirt.<br /><br />It fits well, looks durable.
B00JAWR4SK|2|Would've been great if it worked. Purchased it for the 5k glow run and either the battery was weak or it came faulty because I opened the packaging on the way to the race and tried on, I figured because it was still daylight I wouldn't be able to see the glow...I made sure to turn OFF to conserve battery and wait to turn on at the race when dark....at the race it never glowed. I turned on and nothing happened. So all in all a waste of money for me.
B00LPJO808|5|very nice wallet, functional and personalized, best service I've had in awhile. Quality and price are right,,thank you------Bud
B00AVXZ07E|5|I love the breezy material, it simply looks great. The color cordinated shell is longer in back and leaves the belly button exposed. The fluttery sleeves of the chiffon overshirt and the long tails in front give it a flirty look.<br />I would totally recommend this blouse.
B003UNL1LQ|4|I was happy to buy this as a father's day gift for my boyfriend, however it is a much darker grey with a much more prominent striped pattern than appears in the picture. He was fine with it though, and as a 6' guy it fit him perfectly (he wanted it to be a little loose). It arrived the first day of the 4 day estimate for shipping, and I was very pleased!
B00TFCSWH2|4|These are perfectly adorable. The description says &#34;slim&#34; and they are. I ordered a 10 for my 9 yr old (he wears a 10 usually) and they are snug. I have to return and order up. But love them.  Also the leg is a skinner fit, more tailored than a loose fit trouser.
B00VD0M4WS|1|Product seemed ok, but they sent me the wrong size and it doesn't come with a belt. I tried to send back, and seem to get a the run a round. I lost my money. Keep in mind if you order from overseas it will be hard to ship back. I'd stick with American products.
B00FDIDPCE|5|I love this jacket, it is beautifully made and came sooner than expected.  Just order your dress size if you want it to be form-fitting or one size bigger if you want to be able to layer.
B00C9T2XDW|5|I bought it for my daughter she loves it.I don't think she has taken it off since she got it lol
B007KTDQPK|5|Awesome product!!!!!! Got them for  a steampunk pirate cosplay but wear them all the time because they are so special!!!!!! Very light weight and comfortable 😍
B00LUF85GA|5|&#34;Hot Stuff: is what my granddaughter called herself when she saw this skirt for her birthday.  She adored the zippers and I adored the shorts underneath.
B00KS4OAQS|2|Back pocket area ripped after first wash.
B00EVLZV94|5|I am a 5'5&#34; powerlifter around 160 lbs. with a bit of muscle. The slim fit medium fits perfectly on me.
B00MWKJMBE|5|I love this shirt, it is see through, but I wear a strapless bra under it and it looks great!
B002LVRFUY|3|Its did'nt stay over my ears so I had to do some tuck and stitch now it fits better..
B00EPDTN6A|4|I ordered this Hoodie for my teen aged cousin for her birthday. She really enjoys it and wears it all the time. It shipped one time and was in great condition. I would recommend this product.
B004FOJSBO|5|I like this one because the logo is nice and large. Great for a Captain Hammer Halloween costume, but also comfy enough to wear as a normal t-shirt or as pajamas.
B00D3REUG2|5|We live in a small rural area and its difficult to find cotton PJ,s for my Grandsons, so I found them on Amazon and bought 30 pair.
B00KAALJP0|5|Wonderful product! Came right on time and looks exactly like the picture shown. Has about 3 sleeves for credit/debit cards. The main fold for money is also provided. And, A clear sleeve for license plate and ID. HIGHLY recommended for Bravest warriors fans!
B00FG9FUAU|5|Adorable and great quality!! Thicker material than standard summer dresses..will hold up through many washes!!
B00JUZELNS|4|Felt very nice on your hands.  Very silkly
B00KJAA0WY|5|This is my 2nd pair of Jag jeans. Love the fit and the length.
B0029T3TUI|1|VERY disappointed. Too large (AND then I have to go to a jewler and resize?) Allergic to material, so it's obviously not what it says it is, and scared because the keychain is already loose (and other reviewers say it will fall open?). Thanks but no thanks. I'm going to Target for a $15 ring that doesn't come with all this unnecessary stuff.  Don't waste your money!
B004RCS1H6|1|I am usually satisfied with most items I purchase through Amazon. This time I was very surprised to receive an item that looks nothing like it does in the picture. Also, the quality of the product was extremely disappointing. Most importantly I consider the  costume to be a bit unsafe since the synthetic fur around the neck ,which is intended to dress up a baby, comes loose easy.
B000UNZRUA|3|I like them they are comfortable I ordered a little too big but wearable
B00DOE4JJ2|4|Do you have xx large ?<br /><br />urgen, if no when is it stocked?<br /><br />Hayabusa Forrest Griffin Hall Of Fame T-Shirt
B00ZSQFZLA|5|Im very satisfied!
B009LN7LMC|5|Nice quality.
B00JVWPALW|5|Wow thought I was getting her normal leggings but these are way better. Thicker softer and sexier!
B004VU0WGC|5|I was looking for socks that would fit a newborn so I bought these and love them alot even though they are still a littl big for a newborn to wear. I can't wait for her to fit them they will be really cute with her outfits.
B00008WFGR|5|I didn't have a problem choosing the size I wanted.  Price was marked 80% off, great fitting, great price! Getting ready to wear this for winter this year!
B00AYV0KSW|4|Very versatile top, i wear it over tank tops
B00J9K7IJI|4|Very nice and soft cotton.<br />Runs big and wide, however after washing,<br />I've dryed it on high for 30 minutes, and guess what,<br />Perfect fit!
B00DZTUY5E|4|they are a little on the short side but very cute pants great quality and great price right size around waist
B006TC6BH4|5|These pants are a little large because I haven't measured my waist in a while. Other than the large size these pant are very well made. The length is just right and everything works as it should. I'd recommend these pants for anyone that has an active lifestyle.
B00CBSRL2Y|5|Love it! It is like wearing a blanket all the time. It less like Burgundy and more red than what is described, but matches the picture.
B00FKZB12Q|5|Ok.
B00MGIU22A|4|For my granddaughter dance.  Perfect Key is not attached very good
B00E89WNCM|5|My boyfriend loves these and is asking for another pair!  Very soft.  I'll probably be getting him another couple pairs.
B003Y7SFAI|5|I love the colors.  These match a lot of my son's outfits (which grandma likes).  Good value for the price.  Have you seen how much baby socks cost at Baby's R Us?  Absurd.
B003828R16|4|My sn picked them out himself and loves the characters.  They fit well and we are happy!  The price was good as well.
B00BTPKM5S|5|I had no problem, highly suggest buying - looks really good :)  I play beach volleyball in it and it works well.
B00AO3YBWG|3|t-shirt is too small like 6~9months size. but the pants is too large like 18months+ size. (compared with the size of NEXT baby clothes)<br />my boy is 16months , the tee is a bit tight for him, but the pants is too large for him. pants fells when he walks.
B00EZ0E8FE|3|Returned. I'm 5'0&#34; and these are way to long
B007IM5IG4|3|I like the material and the way this outfit dos fit. The main thing i dont like about it is that the slit it wider than it should be.
B000UVIFHE|5|Perfect.....thank you!!
B00QIK2MD4|5|My daughter like it
B00MNGK4SC|1|It is too small.  And considering it came from outside the US....I can see why.
B00OTXXW4K|4|BOUGHT AS GIFT, RECIPIENT LOVED IT
B00E8DT50Q|5|I bought this for my girlfriend. It fit her perfectly. She liked the cut and feel of the material and I loved the way it looked on her. Definitely a great buy.
B00F9RNVM8|5|They are just a slight bit shiny like spandex and completely opaque. I'm 5'9&#34; 160lbs and the fit is great. They had a mild chemical smell to them when I opened the package but I washed them twice and it's gone now. I am very satisfied, especially considering the price!
B001TA61YY|5|This is a great cap gun, very nice and shiny well worth it.  Has a nice weight to it and it fits pretty well in your hand.
B00LOMOA1S|5|nice, thin t
B000NVWZ2W|5|Love it!
B00440CRQM|5|Great Joe's jeans, fit as expected, great material, great bargain for the price.  Product shipped promptly without no defects or product damage.
B0051D7PT0|5|Great quality; perfect fit.
B00QM2S6O2|4|Functional but not amazing - great price though and best for yoga
B00TMMRDW0|2|they were too small
B00FB1W948|3|I'm 5'8 with pretty long legs. They don't have that much give, so I can't pull them up all the way. The inseam ends up being too low and uncomfortable.
B005GV2RAY|3|BUT it is warm.  I got it for my adult daughter and she took a pic with it on but hasn't worn it since.  I wouldn't buy it again.
B00AEVVTAA|5|I gave this sweater to one of my best pals for Christmas and she wants to wear it ALL THE TIME! Perfect fit. Great product.
B00AKSD00Y|5|This pant is comfortable for sports activities, is comfortable, good quality, presents a clear and not opaque color, my husband is chubby and loves his pants
B001O06DWE|5|Classic great looks and great feel.
B0063UD4Z4|5|Purchased preemie size for my granddaughter.  She weighed about six and a half pounds.  This hat was only slightly big, but has an inner drawstring to make it fit.  Adorable hat!  It came beautifully packaged and arrived promptly!
B00EB125T8|5|Loves these
B00FJ5LI3O|3|A little too big, I am going to order the small one and give the larger one to my wife.
B002C1BJHI|4|This is a nice, light-weight jacket. It goes great with my godson's uniform for school. It is easy to clean and maintain, and it great for those days that are just a bit nippy.
B00457WW8M|5|I bought this for my niece she said she tried it on before she had her baby boy and it fit good and now after it fits just as well and she loves it!
B004Y3F7XY|5|excelente
B00CJGXD1Q|2|It's ok, but fit is a little odd and the padding in the bra area was all folded up and bumpy.
B00E7RMWJE|3|Seems warm enough and would have been a hand garment for cold weather, but as previous reviews have stated: there is no instructions as to how to fold it to get the 6 different functions shown.  Could not even find anything on google.  Somewhat disappointing.
B0033PRG9M|3|I saw this hat in a store in Zion National Park in dark brown.  I had to have it!  I wanted it in a light color so I could wear it in the summer.  I found it on Amazon at a much better price, and a lighter color. But, the darker color in the store was better quality then the one I purchased on Amazon.  I have purchased several San Diego Hats and they are a good quality hat company.  I wonder if this hat is a fake - and not really from San Diego Hat Company?  I changed the plastic strap to a piece of raw hide and added beads - I love it - but, because it is crocheted raffia it is a little flemsy - also, the tag in the back is not centered and it makes the hat off centered a little bit because when they formed the hat they used the back tag to crease the top of the hat. I thought about returning it - but, because the hat was a good price it was not worth me sending it back, because of shipping costs.  If I purchased it at at store I would have returned it!
B00LDI74FW|5|Great hat!  Nice company.
B00DR8PDB8|5|Fits perfect.
B00WAGXI92|5|Great jeans.  The shade of blue was slightly different than what I expected but going dramatic.
B008LXY0PO|5|Very comfortable!
B00CMWJRR6|5|Beautiful Knee High Socks for my daughter school uniform.
B00QL8QU90|5|Was a good purchase looks as we expected sized dead on.<br />Worth the money as well.
B000OPFE3E|5|Really comfortable. Great fit.
B00AEVISJ0|3|This article has a cheapness to it and I'm somewhat disappointed with it.<br />The fabric is very thin, I'll still use it for my spa, but for the beach I'll look for something nicer.
B005587EKG|4|Kind of itchy but it does the trick.  Had to comb it out a little bit because it looked like a ball of knots when I got it, but it looks really good under the top hat.
B005NXN0GA|5|This cloth is Nice and large does the job. I like using these for my camera lenses and screens.  Can be cut.
B00277FQDK|3|Ordered the wrong thing.  I really wanted a messenger bag with room for a laptop. This is clearly marked as a computer portfolio so not sure what I was thinking. That said, I did open it and examine before returning.  The $85 price is decent. Definitely wouldn't pay more for it and certainly is not worth what is stated as the \\"true\\" price.  Leather was ok.  Cmpartments were tight. If you put accessories in it like power cord/adapter would be tight.
B009LHUU44|5|Got this for my friend's daughter as a birthday gift. The little one looked super cute in it. The clothes fit her perfectly
B002ECF0R0|2|Didn't like it. Had no support or padding for the chest. Also wasn't a true corset, basically a strapless bra. I kept thinking this would be something that I would constantly need to pull up, as is the case with all strapless bras that I wear. I do have a true corset, from David's Bridal,  but it's in white, and I wanted a black one.
B00KM5OMRA|4|Cutest costume ever! Was sad that there was a hole in it when we opened it tho! But it held up and didn't rip further all the way thru trick or treating.
B00W9H6Q3M|1|Has no shape, at all. Purchased a size small, fits like a large. Fabric way too thin and cheaply made.
B00FM28KV2|3|Scarf cam tied in a little knot. When it was untied, it actually had a small hole in it. Very thin, cheaply made. I cant imagine it will look as heavy as it does in the picture.
B008J81TFU|4|I bought these for my 9 year old son, and he absolutely loves them! They are a great fit, and excellent price! They are well worth the investment.
B00BPXITSQ|5|I recently ordered a LOT of onesies for a baby shower.  The Leveret long sleeve onesies were very good quality  - well made and seem true to size.
B00I3Q3OD8|4|I love the skirt, but I was expecting the jersey knit material, this is like rayon and it tighter at the bottom.  So it is a little restricted in movements- no long strides.  But I do love the skirt.
B00VM56OM0|3|Shoes way too large.
B00A44QT4S|5|I was quite impressed with the fit of these pants.  Usually, the hips are good, but the waist is too tight.  Or the thighs are too tight.  But these are perfect. Even the length was just right!  And they're lined!  I didn't remember that from the description.
B00FRH17ZS|5|Fits perfectly for my shape. Love the pockets and heart shaped button details. Makes me wish more dresses included pockets.
B00JMQSLV8|5|Excellent
B00ND9F6SG|5|Excellent quality and ship time. Very happy!
B00O3V5B8I|5|I ordered this dress in black and in medium. I'm 5'5, about 125 lbs and the dress it perfect.<br /><br />I was really nervous about the look when I initially tried it on, but my husband encouraged me to try it on again once my backless bra arrived. So happy I took his advice because the dress looked so much better and continue to grow on me throughout the night. It was a little long, but I wore heels that were about three inches high and could still dance the night away. For the price, this is an excellent buy.
B00IVHFYG4|4|The sizing chart said that it was supposed to fit a certain size.  Even the XL was snug for my size 10 daughter.
B00X3FTK7I|4|Great dress for the value!  Fits nice. Only disappointment was , I thought it would dip/slope  a little in the back. It was straight all the way around.
B00LC91PH0|5|Great for under scrubs. The material is soft, silky, and light. Also stretches and the sizes are generous. I want more colors. I love their pant too.
B006PI26FS|5|I purchased this product and I'm glad I did. It makes getting to your credit cards a lot easier than the traditional wallet. No more wasting time trying to slide the card out of the tiny ill-fitting slots. And if you have to carry a small purse or clutch, this fits right in no problem. The color is nice too.
B00NTVNZNG|4|I have this in two colors and this one is super stiff and never wants to slouch on my head.
B00F0LMCH8|5|Nice
B00ADU27EO|4|I found this rendition of the venerable Ranger or patrol cap to be very good in most respects. The colors were vivid with no bleeding of one color over the next. The fit was almost dead-on with the Small being just a tad too big for me. I would point out to Amazon shoppers that this is not an adjustable cap - you have to get the size right. The brim is perfectly flat and can be shaped to the owner's desire.    There were a couple criticisms though. The material is very, very thin and I expected a little more substantial material than this. It isn't a deal-breaker, I just thought it was odd for a military-style cap to have such thin material. The other issue is that the hat is shipped in a mylar bag with no cardboard insert so it may arrive with the brim bent or mangled in shipping. Mine came through just fine, but I think the seller should package it better.    On the whole, a good cap and I recommend with four stars.
B004XH5YX4|4|Nice jacket for the price.
B00I0QNQR0|2|If so, buy this hat.
B00ACIGVIK|4|good but too large
B00BJ8GYLQ|5|The leather is very nice quality. The wallet is that unique size that fits in most back pockets, but also works well in a sport jacket vest pocket.  There are not many five-slot wallets (both sides) available.  I was pleased to find one.
B00AWLAX40|5|I have spent years hating jeans because of my small waist (29W) and long leg length (36L). I got desperate after not being able to find any jeans, and decided to order a pair offline.<br />I literally could not be any happier with my new jeans. I have never owned a pair of pants or even shorts that fit me so well.<br />The price is more than reasonable, and the fabric I can tell will last forever.<br />Thank you so much for making pants that will fit tall and skinny people haha!<br />I WILL buy these again!
B00IP8R7F0|3|I've shopped here at Holy Clothing before and have always been happy with my purchases... but this particular dress wasn't as good. It runs small. I bought a Medium, I wear a 34-B and it's tight. The neckline is very high. The label says, wash before wearing, I followed the directions perfectly, inside out, cold, delicate, hung to dry and The Embroidery UNRAVELLED!<br />Maybe I just got a weird one... Wish I could exchange it, but I washed it already ;-(
B00PTBGU6S|5|Nice feel, heavy enough to keep out the wind and mild cold, yet not too much for a walk around sunset times.<br />Jacket is a bit longer than similar jackets I have. The sleeve ends are tighter, even after a couple washings.
B007C3KZMQ|4|These ran a little small for me - still workable and, frankly, unbeatable for the price.
B00KJBZV72|3|This sweater is just okay. It's kind of cute, but it's not as long as I thought it would be and it's not very flattering.
B00IDSY048|4|Really good purchase
B003Z5B3JY|5|love this had, adorable, adjustable, and might need to find it in other colors! :)
B001H69HH8|5|These undies are super cute and comfy in person.  The little dots are fuzzy and soft :)
B003OQTY5E|5|This is the 5th one I have bought over 3 years.  Warmth equivalent of a heavy jacket, but light enough to wear when warm out.
B007OX5E8Y|4|I like the cut of these scrubs and if you are physically fit they should fit well. I have noticed that some run smaller than others. They must use different machines or factories. Overall they are comfortable and durable.
B000TXTOSW|5|my favorite work scrub pant.
B000U5Y83A|5|this is a good bang for your buck.I have a big head and it fit over it and then can be adjusted to fit good I really like this and plus its a sea turtle you just got to love sea turtles!
B0074GGS6I|5|A great buy.If you want dual purpose shorts, a Cargo shorts that's ready for a dip in the water! :)
B009WS5S6C|5|I get so many compliments on this, and ordered the darker one as well! I should have bought several more as gifts!
B00W3H3H8K|2|These are thin, rip at the toe seam easily and one sock was ripped while it was still in the package. I would not recommend. Cheaply made and will last one or two wears at best.  Two stars because of the option to get several socks in the same color and the grip at the heel.
B005P68KDI|4|I got the package right away and they were all just adorable!! They do have a funky fish Smell to them. But I just hand washed the band's in dreft:) good overall for the price
B003DZ0BJY|3|These fit ok. Just like the picture.
B00FWINWAA|4|This catsuit is AWESOME!!!! It fits like a glove, but doesn't show body flaws and imperfections! I looked super HOTTTT in it!! Great quality! It was a day later than expected, which is why it wasn't a 5 star rating. Overall, awesome buy!
B00LJNXPEA|1|It's an adorable shirt that is soft and comfy for someone who wears a small or medium size shirt if they order a 3x. You can't order things from China off Amazon..... Other countries, if you're going to sell things in the US, learn our size chart!
B00AFCHUJW|3|This was too hard to open. Never used it. Maybe ok for a man, of which I am not.
B004WAXDX0|5|I just got my pretty pusher in the mail today. Our baby will be here in about a month so ill update my review when I actually use it but so far I'm very excited! Seeing it I know I'll feel less like a hospital patient & more like a regular gal giving birth in a cute outfit vs ugly hospital gown!
B00N6ELPY2|5|Good quality, fit is as expected.
B0083F2NZE|5|Very good product, not long in coming to my residence. Size and excellent quality material. definitely buy again. I recommend
B0016A7S5I|5|These are the absolute best pants around for work.  I won't wear anything else.
B005W4MX86|5|To be clear, this is not a fall or winter coat.  You should layer if you want to wear this during the late fall/winter seasons.<br /><br />The rain jacket itself has held up in a light drizzle to a downpour keeping me dry.  The material breathes really well too.  I ordered a medium (which is my normal size) and it fit well.
B00D8WBI1W|5|This pull over crochet cover easily dresses up any t shirt or outfit.  It is a great accessory.
B00BVEA27K|5|It said to order a size up so I did and it was WAY TOO BIG. So I am exchanging it for my normal size. If you want it to be super loose, then go ahead but I wouldn't recommend ordering a size up. Definitely made that mistake. LOVE the shirt otherwise! (YAY TAYLOR :)
B008OY5EM8|3|This is a comfy and cute top. I especially like the lace touch in the back. The material is super thin and transparent, so you need to wear something underneath.
B00MN88JKU|5|Very soft. Very pretty and sexy. I am S, ans ordered S that fits perfect.<br />Fast delivery is also impressing.
B008FGRQRG|3|Package arrived on time, but shipped usps, so I had to deal with the post office, which is never fun.<br />The leggings fit well and feel great! I expected better quality for the price. I've worn them 4 times now and they already seem to be wearing out in the crouch area.<br /><br />Nice for occasional use, but not an everyday legging
B003IFYBAY|5|they fit well:) im 5'7 140 lbs-ish sometimes 150! they fit well. tight enough up top where they dont fall down on me. I LOVE THEM! oh i got them last week and its now monday and i still have a day left on exspected delievery!!! SHIPPING & PRODUCT 5 STARS :)<br />i have a picture but i guess amazon only lets you upload videos. -Supa sexy!
B00U9OBZXI|2|The dress is beautiful but the material is not good really cheap
B00AZK1P8Q|5|It took me a while to find a matching jacket in Adidas Hero-Ink Blue, to match my tennis skort and shirt, and I finally found it. Moreover, this is a great jacket - excellent quality - warm but light to wear - both when you're driving to your tennis club and during warm-ups !
B001BZ685O|4|love it
B002I047HC|1|We've bought children's wigs before, even an Ariel one which held up pretty well for over a year, but this one is terrible. It looks awful right out of the package. The hair is not parted on the side and cannot be adjusted because there are huge gaps of cap between each row of 'hair'. It is straggly, no wave or sheen, and no matter how hard we tried we couldn't get it to look even remotely decent. Looks like it has been in the bottom of a toy bin for a year. Maybe we can use it for a troll or witch in the future, but not a chance for Ariel. In terms of size, the mesh cap was kind of small for my 6 yo's head, but we probably could have made it stay on with pins.   Bottom line, do not buy the wig with this picture on the package! We've been much more satisfied with other versions.
B00NB2HGC4|4|Fit great, easy to get on, just kind of ugly.
B00LLLLPKG|4|Item ran a little large for newborn. Great quality.
B00PSQY93K|5|My daughter is a gymnast and says its the best for fit and comfort :)
B005LC39GE|4|Nothing is sweeter than watching your 1 year old run around in one of these.  Lilttle tarheel!  This makes a great gift for other Carolina fans as well
B004E0ZX1I|4|The shirt is great--quality, look.  I ordered a medium and it was too small, though.  I had to return it.
B00INZA2K2|1|The &#34;icing&#34; on the cupcake frays terribly when washed.  So, don't buy this unless you only want your daughter to wear it once, or if she is so clean you won't every have to wash it.
B001T4XSLY|5|Great belt, love the comfort click so i can make it as loose or as tight as needed, no odd punched holes to deal with.
B0002MGBOK|5|I acquired this sleepwear product for my wife with some Vanity Fair sleepwear gowns for birthday gift for my wife.  She indicates they fit perfectly, the color, style, and quality of sewing etc are perfect.  She is totally pleased with them.
B007IKER4K|5|Fantastic t-shirt! This is a great gift for a Big Bang Theory fan. My husband loves this shirt. Runs small.
B00PJVTNBM|1|The size is too large. I'don't like
B005S0OV98|5|This shirt is so comfortable! I ordered a medium size, not realizing that it was Men's Medium, so the arms are a little longer than I would have liked, but aside from that it is awesome! The fabric is soft and overall the shirt if very comfortable. Matches the color in the photo very well.
B00J9UQID0|5|I really like this jacket. It's warm and cozy - even in wind chills that are near zero this week. It cuts the wind, and the fleece lining is very plush and soft. I am glad I saw that it runs small, because it prompted me to order a size larger than I normally wear. It fits perfectly.
B00K5KMWTC|3|Very cute dress . Pretty true to its size .
B0052WBU0A|4|muy bueno
B00M0JPNUG|5|I bought these gloves for a friend of mine who ended up not needing them, so I brought them home and tossed them in the closet to gather dust without much thought.  One night I went to run my Husky around in the snow, but couldn't find where I had hidden my regular gloves, so I shrugged and decided to don these \\"ladies\\" gloves instead.    Now I'm a reasonably masculine guy, but the first word to pop into my head to describe these was, without question, \\"fabulous.\\"  Granted, they're the first set of \\"convertible\\" gloves I've ever owned and fortuitously my glove size falls right around XL for Women's sizes, but seriously.  They're fabulous.    The gloves felt a little snug at first, but they've since loosened up to fit pretty perfectly.  They feel well-made and the dexterity afforded by being able to flip the mitten-esque flippitty-flap and convertible thumb back without needing to remove the entire glove is glorious.  So far they've been comfortable in all but the most extreme cold. I live in Colorado and while it's dry here, these cut it just fine until the temperature starts nearing 0°F.  The little strap holds the mitten flap securely in place (no Velcro or anything) so it's never flopping around and the thumb can't slip off unintentionally.  Plus they look totally badass because they're fingerless gloves.  But you already knew that because you're looking at the reviews for a pair of a fingerless gloves.    Curiously, they don't seem to sell the Brown color I got anymore, which is a shame as I was going to remark about how they had a purple sheen to them in the right light.  But I won't dock them a star for that.  This time.  All-in-all, fabulous.  And I rarely leave reviews, so yes, I'm digging my ladies gloves.
B00ADJE5UY|3|Neck hole was oddly oversized.
B000ROFWDE|4|They're fine. A little big, and folded weird so I had to iron them.
B005IR2BU2|5|Nice fit
B00N30Q5N0|3|My daughter is 2-1/2 and wears a size 7-1/3 shoe. These socks just barely fit her feet brand new, once washed they shrink and are now to small. Too late to return them now that they are worn ... disappointed because socks themselves are cute.
B00IO0DEJC|3|This was not the quality I had hoped for.  It's sufficient right now but the material does not stretch like a traditional beanie.
B00IEQYYM2|3|Not a good traveling shirt because it wrinkles so badly.
B005G0RBDS|2|The dress overall was pretty. The color purple of the was perfect.  The dress fit until it van to the  bust area.
B00LCJ1MF0|5|These fit perfectly. More comfortable than jeans and sweats.
B0051EFJ2Y|4|Washes and dries well. Fabric is not as heavy as expected but nice feel to fabric. I would buy again.
B00DV4MITS|5|I LOVE this Adidas workout capris.  I typically get Under Armour because I really like the way they they fit and feel when working out, but I saw these and decided to try something new.  I love how they feel very similar to what I already know and love (my under armour capris).  These pants fit very comfortably around the waist, snug but not too tight or restrictive.  I also love how the bottoms are open at the bottom instead of fitting to the leg.  It's a nice difference from my under armour capris.  I appreciate the small pocket, however I wish it were in the front on either the right or left hip instead of in the back.  Being located on the back of the pant is slightly inconvenient, but not a huge deal breaker.  I love how flexible they are, and how sweat easily wicks around through the material.  I also think the logo on the right front hip is stylish!  I enjoy brands that clearly display their logo so you know what someone is wearing.  Very glad I purchased these, just wish I would have been able to buy more, but they only had one left in my size.  I will be checking again in the near future to see if they are re-stocked so I can purchase more!!!!
B00V5ZFMG6|4|A bit see-through and very small. Pretty romper regardless.
B0037X7WHQ|3|Spanx has a great reputation. I bought this item mainly because of that. I have that post-second baby pouch, and wanted something to smooth out my waistline. It does help keep everything smooth, but the draw back is that it doesn't help shapewise. I don't have lumps and bumps with this on under my tshirts, but my tummy comes out to the same place it does as when I am not wearing it. I did expect more tummy control so in that, I'm dissapointed. It is true to size.
B00DQGW5EE|5|I am short. 5ft 130lbs (just had a baby) so i have a little belly pouch that i still need to hide. I read other reviews regarding the fit so i purchased a medium, and it fit perfectly. It could probably go a little smaller but i think the small wouldve been too fitted as i am comfy with a little loose drag. Looked super cute and can be dressed up or down with proper jewelry and shoes.
B00OVUY5CE|3|I followed the sizing chart, when I received it I immediately put it on. Hooking on the loosest hook it was snug but not &#34;tight&#34;. After wearing it for no more than 15 minutes I took it off. Several hours later I put it back on, and was able to comfortably hook it on the tightest hook... Wish I'd have gotten a smaller size. You can see the hook seams under tighter clothes. But I can see a difference in my waist shape. It's slightly more defined even after only wearing for a short time.
B003E98ATM|2|I'm a size 7 and was very mad that the 8-10 didn't fit because that can't be the right size.  I was so excited about it and the disappointment level was super high.  It is a nice custom too which is why when it didn't fit, even though I ordered size up, it was so much more disappointing.
B00NLPAKVK|3|Too small I'm size M I buy L and now I changed for a XL
B002NH2PB0|3|Rather small compared to others purchased in the past .
B00ME0Z08G|5|Very cute, super soft and fits my son just right.
B00O5GJE0C|5|Great buy. Sizing was accurate
B00575B0RU|4|I wanted a mid length down coat that could be worn with office attire as well as everyday. I got it with this coat! It has a nice rich brown color with a slight black iredescence, and is very flattering. I get compliments every time I wear it.  However, I gave it 4 stars because the sleeves are a bit tight. I have average size arms compared to my body, and do not have this problem with any other coat I own. Even with that being said, I love it so much I kept it! I just make sure whatever I wear under it doesn't have bulky sleeves.
B00JG2FZMQ|5|Comfortable, material is thin enough to be cool but not so thin it is see through. Great to wear on a casual summer afternoon. I am 5'6&#34;, 138lbs. A size medium fits nicely, hits at ankles.
B008CHG5B6|5|This is a precious dress for the price. The material is a little thin, but it fits well and looks really pretty in the pictures.
B00B4O3E9A|4|These are comfortable and fit as expected. I am looking to maybe buy another 1 or 2 more pairs. I might buy a medium just to see how that fits. I want to wash them first to see how they do after one wash. I also really like how they look. Great brand overall.
B003ZS7H14|5|This is a really great color!  I love how it stands out so much.  I had a problem with the first skirt I ordered, but the seller immediately contacted me to address my concern.  I was pleasantly surprised about how attentive they were to my concern and they shipped me a new skirt free of charge!  I had a great experience with the seller and would recommend to anyone!
B00K93JT7I|5|so cute!
B007ABVDBW|5|This dress is great. I'm a little busty and had no trouble with the fit.
B0081Q1OAA|5|The material is thick enough for cold weather and comfortable to move around when play sports.<br />Im gonna order another one soon
B00DWWSZQY|5|Fit is perfect. Have only worn it twice so far. Previous Izod shirts have lasted a long time and I expect that with this shirt.
B00K0C3KG4|5|I love the way it make me look. Slim and sexy.
B00EA025WW|5|It was exactly what was pictured and was exactly what I wanted. Not much else left to say about it.
B0041EHA6I|5|I received the Union suit on time.  It fit me big but it was used for a Halloween costume which made my costume even funnier.
B00654T06A|3|It is really soft, but it smells really bad. I don't know if it is the packaging or the material.
B000CBUHWI|4|I was excited to find green santa hat on the Amazon web site. I had been looking for one quite a while.     I like the hat, but it is a little big. This is one-size-fits-all. I usually wear women large.
B00LCVINKU|5|love it...it is about a size 8-12 depending on whether you like it looser or not
B006P2F6T2|4|I'm mostly happy with this shirt.  It fits a bit snugly at the  moment but I do have a little more baby weight to loose in the stomach area.  It's easy to use while nursing and is comfortable.
B00804B994|5|Excellent buy, very good quality and perfect fit
B00L3EZ4RG|5|Really cute dress.  Fits true to size
B00K6K6F5I|5|Very Happy!!!
B00F3Y2DOE|3|Fit was great. Was does not look like picture. The top is white and pink instead of two shades of pink and the buttons aren't like the picture
B001H0FQII|5|As long as you know what size you want, how can you go wrong buying Levis online?  You don't have to search through piles of similarly-sized jeans trying to find exactly what you want, and they deliver to your door.
B003ITYYAC|2|Well, I had this bottle last Thursday.. I used it barely 2 times...  Right Now I just discovered that the letters, which they make'em look engraved... Are just STICKERS.  Pretty much if you wash the bottle with a sponge... The \\"Vodafone McLaren Mercedes\\" Label is going to be gone..   And initially thats why I found it cool... Well, NOT ANYMORE!!!!  I know it has NOTHING to do with amazon... But for you guys, dont get cheat on from manufacturers.
B002HJ37GG|5|I wrote &#34;Don't Go Chasin' Waterfalls&#34; on this shirt in black sharpie and wore it as part of my Lisa &#34;Left-Eye&#34; Lopez costume, the only other part being a pair of eyeglasses with a condom glued to one eye.<br />It was a huge success. No one knew who the hell I was supposed to be, just like I was hoping.
B00ACIGM9S|3|I bought these for someone else as a Christmas gift and he has not been pleased with the way they fit him.  I'm sorry I can't be more specific but that's all I know. However, if I had to guess, it's probably the way the seam is sewn in the back of the waistband that would rub me wrong if I was wearing them.
B00A4LPE7Y|5|Really nice but longer than most large t shirts.
B000PQH8O0|1|ordered it,sent me a complete different hat...cheap too,had all these holes in it..sorta like a jersey,very dissapointed but opened and didnt want to go through all the hassle for a return..womp
B002VLZH68|5|If you need scientific, wicking, fast-dry fabric in your shorts, look elsewhere. However, for a rugged, cotton athletic short, these fit the bill perfectly at a great price point.<br /><br />I bicycle to work every day (but hate biker's shorts), run frequently, and also do Crossfit workouts, and these shorts give me good freedom of movement while breathing in the way that only cotton can. I also occasionally use them as &#34;lounging&#34; shorts on the weekend, which is where the pockets come in handy (if I need keys or wallet for running an errand). The &#34;Rugby&#34; short is definitely a thicker material than Champion's normal shorts, so for me, the added durability is worth the slight price premium.<br /><br />However, if they get wet, they will stay wet, and will not air dry quickly. Thus, these are not really the best choice for endurance events, adventure races and the like. That said, they last a long time and do exactly what I need them to.
B009RETLM8|5|Flattering and so soft and comfortable I could wear it to bed.  You know something looks good when more than one person asks to borrow it when you wear it for the first time.  Definitely worth the buy.
B009S0S4BK|5|These are the cutest socks of my life.  You will not regret all the happiness you will receive as a result of purchasing this babies.
B00FJDNBBI|5|Beautiful Shawl!!!  Shipped fast!
B0097M9FN0|5|Excellent, to perfection, fit very well, very comfortable, at least to me neither long nor short these are great, I recommend it to my eyes closed and most important, no problems with the measures.
B004NPA544|4|This particular order was bigger than expected because I had not fully ascertained what my ideal fit would be . The fit of different sizes seem to vary across product lines  , so this was a trial run for me . I  , however  , was able to give it to my brother who is 12 years my junior but two sizes my senior .
B0029Y4JP2|5|Soft and comfortable and fits right. Just like my khaki colored one, which is why I ordered it. I just wanted an alternate color.
B000JHAXQA|5|If you want a coat that keeps you warm for the winter then I reccommend buying this one. I don't have to have layers on unless it's really cold and with the hood on it I don't have to wear a hoody under it either.
B008H8KG8S|5|Great value; very nice looking suit; I would definitely recommend!
B008DZ0ZR2|5|From the moment I put on this shirt my life changed. Meth heads kept approaching me begging me for the blue stuff.<br />The things they offered blew me away. Literally.<br />FIVE STARS!!!
B002LFA142|4|Daughter loves the sweatshirt. Hood is much bigger than it needs to be for the size.
B00REIMDKG|4|Kinda big, but it was ok
B00GU427SS|4|I purchased this jacket directly from London Fog, but it is the same exact one pictured here.<br /><br />Quality:  The leather is extremely smooth and soft and the stitching and other details are high quality as I expected from London Fog.<br /><br />Fit: I am 5'9\\" weighing 140 lbs and I bought a medium. It is fitted closely all through the arms and at the waist and shoulders, but it is quite loose through the chest.  It would probably fit a very large chested woman of my general dimensions quite well, but its not quite right on me. The arms are very tight at the top and I can feel the arm seam pressing into the top of my bicep, which is slightly annoying but it will probably stretch out with further use. I definitely could not fit a thick sweater underneath but thinner clothing fits okay. This jacket is clearly meant as a fashion accessory when it gets a little chilly and would not function as a coat during very cold weather.<br /><br />Look: It looks as pictured when it is zipped up.  However (and this is why I gave it 3 stars), due to the fitted shape when the jacket is unzipped it flares out at the bottom and looks a little ridiculous.  Since it is a lighter weight jacket, it seems unlikely that I will want to go around with it zipped up all the time, so I am a bit disappointed in its overall look.<br /><br />I'll try to update this review after I wear it for a while.<br /><br />UPDATE**: I raised my original 3 star review to 4 stars.  I still think there are better jackets out there, but this one is really comfortable and after wearing it for a while I got use to the slightly weird fitted design.  No one has commented on it looking funny when unzipped and I basically forgot about it over time.  Its a great jacket for the right price.
B00KYKR45K|5|Beautiful!
B00EICWNPG|3|Wished I ordered bigger for my son.  Sleeves were a little on the short side but he pushes them up, he's happy so that is all that matters.
B002UJLJEA|1|Very poor quality despite the low price. Terrible item. I would not recommend this item. I promptly returned the wig.
B001HW010O|5|My daughter, who is very particular about comfort in dresswear, loved wearing this dress. It did not itch, pinch, or become in any way uncomfortable. We got through the theater, a long car ride, dinner, and a 30-minute wait in line for Santa without a single complaint. The dress didn't wrinkle and looked as good in pictures at the end of the long day as it had at the beginning. All for a very economical price. I'm very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE: This dress held up beautifully when washed at home on delicate in my HE machine. I put it in the dryer, too. No problems.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/23/2013: Over a year later, I have washed this dress many times. Pluck it out of the dryer warm, place on a hanger, and it is wrinkle-free! No pilling. Seams are intact. Dress has been passed down to younger sister. Looks fabulous.<br /><br />Buy this dress!!!
B00RM8WVS2|5|Great design, easy to wear it, im a size 34 waist and it fit well as expected
B00GGZDXGQ|3|They fit good, I got my size that i have always worn, they are a little see though tho so maybe they are a little tight, but other than that they fit, and I'm short and these fit my length, I got a medium and I'm 5'2 130lb and I have a butt, so its hard to find pants that fit.
B0051U195O|5|Fantastic socks, very pleased with this purchase
B006L3V9RI|5|you can always count on hue socks to be the best.  i used to buy all kinds of other socks, but now i just buy hue.
B005XP9QPC|5|Fundamentals work as hard as you do! Wash and wear..comfy and always look great
B00N8XBO9W|4|Nice but still too short for a costume, at least for what we wanted. For something a little more private it would be good.
B004GONE7W|4|wrong size, had to return. But, the quality was good.
B00EK5577C|3|I found this shirt on Wanelo and I saw a picture of it on a person and it looks totally different on that person than it does in real life. It is the same shirt. Its a lot shorter and not as over sized as I thought.
B00G4I6EKW|5|Got this for a friend and she loved it . It is such a cute shirt and the characters on it look really nice. Not faded or anything...
B00L8W1652|5|I love this skirt its really cute and its comfortable.
B001FD36R0|5|My daughter loves these, hard to find in Australia and expensive, worth putting in with an order to save on post.
B00JGHNLGS|5|Loved the embroidery, shirt material and colors.  But size smaller than expected. Get next size for better fit.  Would definitely purchase other clothes from company.
B001EASBUG|5|This shirt fits somewhat large by design. I am a big guy and I love that finally I can get something that fits, is made well and looks good.
B00GGIS6W4|5|good
B0008EOGP8|5|At $26.99 it is really a bargain. The same Lee jeans is equivalent to $51.00 in my country. Same quality. Fitting is good and as described. Really satisfied with this buy and will buy more in the future.
B00CE1TS9M|4|Cool shirt, loved the quote, bought this shirt for my mom as a gift, she like it. If you like the TV shower Breaking Bad I recommend this shirt.
B00Q8IP3QY|4|There was absolutely no return information included in the package, good thing it fit.
B00O2BO5KE|5|Very cute item. Love Daniel Tiger.
B00J9PY7RE|5|Very good quality tops! I can see it right away. I recommend these tops for every mom.
B00J4K5B74|4|Dress even looks small before putting it on. But it works.
B000IRYULA|2|This is a great idea however I found these tops to be to bulky under my regular clothes because the seams showed to much. It was obvious I was wearing this top under my clothes.
B00J2WLA42|5|Of course these are awesome. If you like Levi's you will not be disappointed, the fit is great, tight but I can breath and move.
B00509BMLW|5|very nicely made
B00FGNAAHY|2|was very pretty, but the panel in the back was terrible! i dont know how you would wear it with that panel in there
B0081CLQOI|4|Would have been 5 stars but I don't like the pointed look.  I plan on keeping and will wear with loose clothing but not a tshirt. Fit is very comfortable
B0099I79XA|5|Its exactly like the picture. Want to. Buy more but have no more money left from all the other shirts from here.
B000BNJQJM|5|Very nice fit; smooth, comfortable feel; works great in hot weather.  And the wife even likes it on me (she was amazed that I picked it out).
B00FQ1KFGM|5|Bought this for my boyfriend he loves it :) true size and soft!
B008ZYCXIA|2|I feel as though it were poorly made. I ordered a extra large and my ribs are only 34 inches, and this thing not only didn't fit, 2 of the buttons knobby literally popped out before it was even buttoned the second time I wore it.
B000SKLTIE|5|Good stuff.
B002Z25178|5|Good quality, I'm very happy with it.
B002T6NMX0|1|Don't buy Spanx panties. The waistband rolls down (no matter if you have the right size or not), which is quite uncomfortable and bulky under your clothes.
B00QF69GMG|5|I love it.
B00MXUFE6A|5|Beautiful and a great fit. Also came in black. My girls wore leather jackets and boots also from Amazon!
B00416CB56|5|Nice socks
B00MLXUDVU|5|I love it. It is soft and fun to wear. It fits just right. I may buy another color.
B00CFQVLO6|2|This dress looks somewhat cheap, for what you're paying. The fit is not flattering at all. It looks like it is hanging off of the body. Do not recommend.
B002JLZUZS|5|great quality and perfect fit
B000IUSKEU|3|This piece is actually really cool--and it's being used in a production of XANADU, but in order to put it on the actress' head, the skull cap portion of the headdress had to be cut down pretty extensively.  It is REALLY small and unflexible.  Once the cap was cut, it looks fantastic, but if I wasn't a costume designer, I would probably have had an issue.
B000XEVHH8|3|I haven't used this makeup kit yet as will use it for Halloween, but have looked it over. It is only in a very basic way a Freddy Krueger makeup. The appliance is well sculpted, just is not Freddy. The grease makeup supplied is off too as it is mostly browns. Freddy is mostly pinks and reds over a fleshtone base with a bit of brown in spots that are charred. I will be using this with other products and also am aiming for a generalized Freddy for Halloween so it will work, but as a fan I am disappointed with how inaccurate it is.
B00D2YUPEW|1|It says it is a top. It is more like a headband. I guess it could fit around a baby but my 11 year old daughter who is extremely thin could not even wear it. So it is in the garbage no use for it at all.
B001H0F660|4|Excellent price. Inconsistent fit. Some shirts are very short after a wash and dry.<br />It's to be expected for less than $10 a shirt. For the price it's no big deal to toss the ill fitting shirt to the side for a painting project.<br />Great colors. No fading. The seams are great. No loose threads. Great athletic fit. We will be buying more
B00HJHE7S8|5|i received the leg warmers and they fit as expected are good quality and very warm and comfortable am satisfied with my patience
B00FERRM1O|5|One size fits all so how could you go wrong. Is quite flattering because the ribbed texture helps hide all those fun lbs I have packed on after this long,long winter. Color is just like the picture. You can pull the skirt up or down to the length you desire. This was a happy find!
B006MQSUE4|5|The quality and style is just great  -  as  is the white.  Perfect with all kinds of sweaters, blazers and of course blouses.  Cannot go wrong with this skirt.  Fits perfect and the \\"modern\\" hem length and textured material makes its a very stylish addition to go with exiting items in my closet.
B0036OS6MG|4|These are as comfortable as comfortable gets.
B00EPDW042|4|VERY cute...but buyer beware, these are not very stretchy and fit more like a jr size. But the quality, shipping and image is SUPER CUTE!! Returning for a bigger size and can't wait to receive it!
B00QRC0CQ2|5|Excellent quality cotton and construction.
B00L1FW4M0|5|I have been wearing these shorts since I bought them- they are SO comfortable! I also love that you can't see through them like you can with some exercise shorts. I bought two packs of two and I'm looking at getting more and wearing nothing else!
B006SVWEU4|5|love love love love This was such a cute little outfit!! I bought it for my daughters 2nd birthday! We got lots of complements!! So cute!!
B0042L6D90|4|Wish it was a little bigger for men that have large heads. Very cute!
B00ARDD6P6|5|At first I thought they were a little thin but they actually were fine. I love the colors! My son looks great in them.
B00KSVIX5A|4|I'm 5.5 weigh about 125 lbs and wear 36B bra size. Having read the other reviews I decided to size up and I'm glad I did because I rather something be too big than too small especially with this top being shipped from China. The top fits just a little big but it can be fixed. The material is OK for the price, although you have a wear a cami inside because the back is not lined (only the front is lined). I would recommend.
B00DHR3ON8|5|Very comfortable
B00F0LQMSS|4|This was a gift for my teen nephew and he loved it. Says he'll wear it a lot!
B00CVRGDJW|2|Nice fabric but it fits fine across the back but the front stops just a little in front of arm pits.
B00A0BVALW|5|This is a very nice hat. My daughter just got it for Christmas and it looks very hip and cute. We got the version with the eyes closed because it seems to be the nicest. I also managed to wash it and dry it and I've had no problems with it at all. I highly recommend it!
B006HSD6NM|5|I am overall happy with the shirt.  The fabric is good quality, and rather thick. The shirt looks very professional. One thing I would change - is to have it more tailored...<br /><br />After wearing the shirt for some time, I decided to raise rating from 4 to 5 stars, as I really like the fabric - no need to iron, except for some very special cases. And I like a lot how my blue shirt looks with a suit - really professional and crisp
B00EKZSXEG|5|It is a beautiful shirt for boy. I think my son will be more handsome when putting on the shirt.
B00J7BZCKQ|5|Very cute but way small had to return
B0077IGS5Y|5|Boyfriend loves em
B00755L7N2|5|;-)
B003V2XUFG|5|Great hat! Think I will buy some different colors.
B00CURNQW0|1|NOT Sized Correctly. Too Small
B006LHN9UY|5|I love the support and comfort provided, can very comfortably run/walk my 14 miles a day without any need for additional support.
B00K1HH5NC|2|Poor quality & fit
B00EM2RM2G|2|I read the review and bought the jacket. It had the smell so I had to washed 3 times.  That concerns me.  It is very warm and comfy though.  I would have not pruchased it if I thought twice because the chemical smell.
B004JN01BC|5|I got these to match the white Portia Bra.  I bought a size larger than I normally wear since my legs and backside are big. They're cute and just a little sheer and are very comfortable.
B003XU6RTW|5|Bought already several items like that. Overall impression is very impressive - good quality, lasts long, stylish and the reasonable price.
B00V5N2DZ6|5|👍
B00GN7Y0JG|4|Very good fabric for the price. The cats doesn't look like cats, so if you want a hipster look you should look for something more edgy, if you are not seeking for everybody asking you: &#34;is that cats on your clothes?&#34; is the perfect romper. Fits very well, i'm tall and is sexy short, not bitchy short (i am 1.70m).
B001AESJOE|5|Good quality. Quick shipping.
B004VMQPE8|5|GREAT LOOKING. I AM VERY PATRIOTIC. LOVE THEY WAY THEY FEEL PRETTY DURABLE. WOULD RECOMMEND THE SITE TO SOMEONE ELSE.
B000W47XJK|5|I love these, hard to find capri sweatpants. Had some from Walmart<br />but can no longer find them as usually !!!!
B008L4E9S6|5|Got this a while ago but never got around to writing a review. Despite that it's definitely not something I regret purchasing. It's great quality, not that cheap crap you see in most stores. Holds up to my  daily abuse very well and there's not a thing wrong with it. It's without a doubt my favorite tie, hands down.
B003X5RBPG|5|Oh. My. Lord. These pants are the BEST! Do not hesitate, buy a gazillion because they are FABULOUS! I am 5'9\\" and am 6 months pregnant right now. I weigh about 153 and my hips are 41\\". It is hard to find pants that flatter, especially being pregnant, and these definitely do the trick. I can't say enough good things about them, they are super comfortable and easily accommodate my growing belly. I can wear them to work out or sleep but they are still dressy enough to layer with a collared shirt. I am not typically one to spend much on clothes but these are well worth the price.
B00862NLLY|5|Very good
B00GS8JWM0|5|Gave as a gift and the recipient was overjoyed with it.
B00PB042VW|4|I think I perhaps ordered the wrong size but it is really comfortable so I will use it.
B00L3KRE3W|4|Satisfied with purchase
B00AO1Q20W|5|Hi Cathy we really appreciate we received the dresses this morning and we are so thrilled with the quality of your work, we are so well pleased
B00E6S2RGW|2|It would be really cute if it was a little longer. I am 5'8&#34; and at 12 weeks so not even really showing yet. I normally wear a medium. I liked the dress but it is very short and not something I would feel comfortable wearing in public. You could try white capri leggings with it to help. I returned mine due to disappointment in the length.
B008NCYC5Q|5|I did not believe that these leggings could be one size fits all, but after reading some reviews from people my size, I decided to try them.  I am sure happy I did.  I love them!  They fit perfectly.  In other leggings I have trouble with the ankles being baggy, but not these.  I wish I had found them earlier because now I want to replace all my other leggings.  I would definitely recommend these.
B00ACIHDT6|4|Very good, but significantly larger
B00GBRJHBO|4|These are cute shorts.  But they are huge.  The waist isn't adjustable so I had to return them.  Which was very easy and painless.  I also thought they would be more of a bathing suit bottom, but they were just shorts,
B00FBCH29Y|4|These are very lightweight and comfortable, but I don't think they are scandalously short by any means. I'm not in the least self conscious wearing these at the gym and I'm fairly conservative about such things. I find contemporary shorts to be way too long for running. The key pocket sewn into the waist band is way too small for a house or car key to fit securely, so you'll take your chances there. I'd say these shorts offer a good minimal feel without over exposure.
B00TXE3NT4|5|Got my dress, it fits and falls amazing. So happy!!
B0053XF8VA|4|Works great for my post baby belly... Stays put also.
B00A2WIZ5S|4|Looks like a medium on my wife. But it's a nice shirt. Just pretty form-fitting so if you're heavier, possibly order a size up.
B00827RUHE|5|These are great for wearing under shorts or pants or really anything.  They fit well and are extremely comfortable.  Love these!
B0079TOSQW|4|I only get what I absolutely need.  So I  only get items that I hope I will not have problems with. So far the clothes have fit well.  the art books I use as practice material.
B00GGE1P9E|5|I have searched for years for a long cardigan sweater and after all my searching decided on this one. It is made well and feels awesome. Fits well and came wrapped up tight and secure. Will definitely get another one in the future, maybe a lighter color.
B0018OFOL2|4|Levi's !
B00H2BYWTU|2|Not sewn right on top one side sewn and other top side not sewn. and sequins made it very difficult to zip and is very see thru.Had to send back.
B00JX3UTHE|1|The empire waist.is made to form fit so its way to tight, other wise l love the dress but can't wear like it is.
B00G570Q4W|1|Material does not match the second pair I ordered in a different color. This material is stiff and feels cheap.
B00C17A0QY|4|It fits as expected after reading reviews, actually it ran a little large. I only just received the shirt a few days ago, but so far I like it much. It fits me well and is quite comfortable. I wanted it for brightness so I might be noticed riding my motorbike. It is indeed a very bright fluorescent. I can't comment yet on how it holds up, so, for now, I must rate it only four.
B004DEJJ6U|3|not 100% cotton.
B00OBAZ8AC|5|Great vest, nice cut and feel.
B000QWDQUS|5|I love it
B004NQU6Q0|4|Have not used them yet, however I beleive they will work just fine.
B00394DMJA|5|It is well made and feels very comfortable. It is reasonably priced for a item of this quality. Will buy more in the future.
B00F4HD16O|4|A nifty little cap for dressier days.....
B00BF2HJ4C|5|I've never worn a compression tank before but these are fantastic. Really tight and supportive fit for the upper part of the body. A little less toward the lower stomach / love handle area but they are as advertised and work great. I will be ordering more to wear daily. Very comfortable fit, not itchy at all. They keep you warm as well :)
B00F3VH12Q|3|One leg smaller than the other. Transparent. The quality is not that great.
B00U75L0MK|1|I was very disappointed in the quality of the dress.  I would never wear it.  Looks nothing like the picture.  False advertising!  I give the dress 0 STARS!!!!!<br />I had to give the dress 1 star, otherwise I could not submit my comment!
B00Y4I0SWE|4|This is exactly what I expected and wanted. It's a little too clingy as far shows any and all your fat rolls if you have any. I have a c section scar and you can see the dimple or as I call it &#34;my smile&#34; from the way the material hangs on your body. I am not fat, but not a twig either. It's the perfect length and it fits loose, but shows your curves quite nicely. I bought them to wear under some dresses or to wear alone walking around the house, or to go to the mailbox, etc. I am 5ft and 110 lbs I think i got this in a size small or a one size fits all. Hope this helps.
B003IC91RK|1|I had to return this costume.  It was made VERY CHEAP, with poor quality.  It was also about 3 sizes too small, even though I ordered my usual size.  I would definately NOT RECOMEND this product.  Yes, it's a cute picture on the web, but you will be very DISAPOINTED!!!
B00J4BYN0Y|1|I'm very dissapointed with the &#34;Sea Mist&#34; jean. It have a big problem in a leg, Can not wear it conffortably, in fact can not wear it. Very Bad Item
B00EPDXNP2|3|The material is very thin and light weight!!!!!  The color is bright emerald green and beautiful!!
B0081PYVU6|4|BEAUTIFUL
B00MTI1IQG|1|I wear a 3x I ordered  a 4x and it is more like a 2x. Very small. When I tried to return them I was told to keep them and I would receive half credit.
B0088X2IE2|3|Not smooth wearing under my capris,causes my capri pant to stick and causes slight folds.<br />It is a wonderful undergarment if you want to keep your control pant from rising up and gives you some support through<br />the thigh area!!!!
B00GNX6D54|3|These pj's are super cute in design and very soft. However, the fabric looks worn out after one washing and the navy color bleeds into the pink stripe areas.
B00I46A0WU|4|Nice material; lush color; good length and design; and comfy.
B009P7XWMM|5|I needed a Buzz Lightyear shirt for a costume and this was perfect!  It fit very nicely and I was able to move around without any problems.
B00C336FGK|5|I bought this for a gift for a friend and she loves it! She is into skulls and it fits her personality.  Very nice scarf.
B00TX5ZCZG|4|beautiful
B00CJ51X0A|4|Don't recommend drying anything from this line of clothing. The shirts shrink but the pants especially on this particular outfit run big through the waist. My 3 year old granddaughter is in panties of course, so I guess I you have a child wearing this size in diapers or pull ups then you will like the fit.
B00AZC6X90|5|Bueno
B00G0LTQ9Y|5|the recipient LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it was for my soon to be niece, her mom's baby shower... ALL the guest loved it and I let them know to look you up for future purchases.<br /><br />The item is just like the picture and great colors!!!!!!!!!! A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00HQ6WZIQ|4|Like but small on the base of the back
B005KGQQSE|1|Thanks for everything  and comes on time.bot Its quality is not good.Please try to do smething for this case.<br />yuors<br />Mohsen
B00CXN5L4M|5|Very nice and soft when the fleece side is on the inside. Great for cool fall days and keeping little ones warm.
B00US6YJXA|5|My husband loves his new Galiva Men's Cotton Lightweight Crew Socks (6 pack). My husband said that they fit great and are very comfortable to wear. He said the socks are really nice for the summer months as the socks seem to breathe keeping your feet cool. They are made of 80% cotton,15% spandex and 5% elastic and are machine washable, tumble dry. These are very high quality socks at an affordable price. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B000ZQ8G1Y|4|Product does what it is supposed to, as you are smoking you can see the black tar go into this device, not your lungs. (:
B0029ZC7AA|5|Warm but no neck protection. Fits under hardhat.
B002X05AN2|5|Worked perfectly.
B002IRJQ9E|5|Just like a movie prop item. Better that a department store mask.
B006EXMBFY|5|My daughter is tiny - under 6 pounds, and I have spent the majority of my time since she was born rolling up sleeves and trying to find items that would fit her.  This bundler is perfect!  It DOES run small - but that is a good thing for us.  It is also incredibly soft, and the graphic is adorable.  And best of all, it washes up perfectly.  I didn't have the trouble that some people had with the bottom elastic being too small - it fits fine over my daughter's legs when I change her diaper.  These sleep gowns are perfect for new babies and night time diaper changes.  I am thinking about ordering more - wish they weren't quite so expensive - but the quality is apparent.
B00CITTF8Y|4|They seemed larger than expected but fit well after washing.
B000RN01HC|3|Very well made, attractive bra.  Unfortunately it was too small:( I followed the fit directions on website but this is the old style(how would anyone know this?) the review by the fit specialist does mention go up one size on the old model-this is the OLD model.  I would advise getting fit by a specialist if you have a big bust.  But the bra is beautiful, and very well made.  Remember go up a size!
B00HLXYFKA|4|No complaints
B00B8QP5AA|5|All good.. Awesome experience..
B000X478FI|3|meh
B00DOI3RZU|5|Nice shirt just needed an XL instead of a L now I know . and by the way I'm 6ft 200 lbs need a XL.
B000MWASR6|5|Product was exactly as advertised.  I am very pleased with the purchase.  Easy transaction.
B00KIH3BXI|2|Fit to large
B00BGT0PF4|5|This top is very feminine, with a lovely mix of flowered embroidery, lace, and ruffles. The outer fabric is mesh, but the lining is soft. I bought the medium because they ran out of small, and it fits loose, but not too much thanks to the smocked back. The whole top is stretchy except for the waist, and it is a little fitted there. The actual colour is a bit darker than in the picture, ivory shell and beige lining.
B005KMBC8W|5|These bras are great for many sizes and figures.  They have removable pads and and removable/convertible adjustable straps so that they go with everything.  I have them in every color and they are comfortable and give you a nice cleavage too (good support for wireless).  Great buy.  Awesome deal since I have seen these in boutiques for $15 each.
B004RJRAVW|2|They are in poor quality. The heels are not the same. I left them at the corner of my room.
B00SU4VSV8|1|I  very disappointed with this. I received the pj sets and washed them on hand wash, hung to dry. My daughter wore one set to bed last night and this morning I noticed the entire seam down her left side is coming undone.
B0058YUH1U|5|Really good shirt. Found it at Macy's; bought it on Amazon and saved $40.
B006RK0H4G|5|i love this scarf!  It looks and feels fabulous.  I definetely recommend it if you love scarves as i do and can never tie them just right
B00JFSQ0K2|5|I love it so nice
B006YCRM1S|2|It's a beautiful wallet. However, you can't use all the slots available to you in your wallet or you are unable to carry it because it won't close.
B00KCJEWOY|5|Great Wear Great Price
B002ANRXQE|5|I love it!  It's light and airy and covers just right.  I wear it to the pool all the time, it's very pretty and feminine(I purchased the blue one). I'm very happy and am planning on purchasing an additional one soon (in a different color of course). ;)
B002OIPRM2|5|My 2 year old grandson loves his umbrella.  He can open and close with no problem.  Love that it is not Disney......so tired of everything Disney.
B000P50VWM|4|A decent T-shirt for the price.
B00CZ2DSDW|5|Good quality. Washed very well. Didn't shrink.
B00KRX4TL6|5|Excellent sweater. Fit and finish are great. Small details like embroidery on the left sleeve and red stitching really make the sweater. It doesn't feel cheap whatsoever - definitely has the look and feel of it's msrp price.
B00NP6DFAS|1|It was more like a loose fuzzy sock. It was not what I was expecting.
B00LHMN61K|5|Nice and comfortable.
B008G39C6Q|5|Quick , neat package , solid article and conforms to the photo. greetings from france
B00BBLEK2G|1|This wig does not fit and is not flatting and I am sending It back!!!! look like someone suck a piece of curly hair on top of my head!!!! NO THANKS SENDING IT BACK !!!
B00BZ5PE64|5|Bought these for my daughter who was cast as Dorothy in her school play.  I ordered a pair of the mediums for her size 8 foot and the shoes were a perfect fit.  The low heal was great for all of the running around she had to do on stage.  The glitter is well attached and survived all the shows and dress rehearsals.
B00CCM4IIY|5|Quality is good and the color is bright, fits good 5`7 and 62kg weight. Don`t transparent.  Seam is a bit twisted, but it`s ok. Recommend
B005C9G6R0|4|Will purchase more in the future giving more colors! They fit well, although I thought they fit just a little tighter. I'm 34-36 waist and purchase small.  Little confusing.
B00DO3NZ4I|5|Love the color, the price and the fit!!! thank you
B00T2TKQW2|1|I didn't like it .
B008LE1WF4|5|These pajamas were all around a good buy....not only was the design adorable, they fit perfect, and were very true to size.
B002USCHMY|5|This sleep suit is adorable, all cotton, and has friendly frog faces on the toes. I think my daughter who just realized she has toes will really love it.
B00FDSTR5S|4|My only complaint is the sizing is not US sizing. Theses come from china. I bought a xl but it fits like a L. So go up a size when ordering
B00FS6T4O4|4|Just as pictured. I bought this for a relative that had to do chemotherapy and for practiral purposes it seems natural.
B00CDG70KW|4|I bought 2 and the sheath split in half one one of them but the other was fine so i would gladly buy again . The sword i have is bendable but that is so it wont fall out of the sheath. i staighted it out and now it can easily fall out but i used a small black unnoticeable pin to keep it from falling out
B0007YR99O|2|Waist fit fine but the cup size was too large
B00SI761QY|5|My husband loves it!
B005O09MYG|3|I ordered this to play an old man in a play, and it worked well for the purpose.
B00D7ED8LO|5|The shirts were absolutely PERFECT!<br />The looked good, fit well and got me several compliments in Hawaii!!!  Will buy again.
B00CRGR22Y|4|We had picked out about 10 leotards on Amazon and let our 5 year old see them all. She liked this one, mostly because it was very pink.<br /><br />When it arrived, she loved it. You can tell from the picture, but the shoulder/upper chest part is a very rich and shiny silver. It looks like a light silver in the picture, but in reality it is darker and fuller, and we like it quite a bit. Also, the picture makes the non-pink parts of the stripe look like a solid shinny color, but they have a few small circle style shapes in the non-pink part of the stripes, which again we like.<br /><br />We had ordered the 5/6 size (S), our daughter has been wearing size 5 comfortably for about 6 months.  But, the leg holes on this are way to tight. The height is about right, but it is too tight throughout the body and the leg holes are very constrictive.<br /><br />Amazon has a great return policy, so we are order the (M) size, and we will return the (S).
B0060JMBFM|3|I got  these because I wanted to wear cute flat shoes this fall without have bootcut or too long slim straight jeans. I am a 5-3 shortie with curves and I am not sure if they will look right. a bit above the ankle, but after looking at this picture they are what they look like.
B00H9K8ZRE|5|Was nice and good price.
B00MWS3CIA|1|I ordered this as a dress; however it is way too short to be worn as a dress.  I have worn it as a shirt with leggings.  The size fits, but the material is very poor quality, I would not purchase again.
B00LBMPP1U|5|Perfect fit love it
B0091RFIAA|4|Everything is ok with this tank. Only just a wish -  if a material could be a little bit soft!
B00DQZ8918|5|Excellent
B004TTOQDK|4|The design is super cute and the price a little steep, but then again you get a ton of product and you also get to mix and match the hair clips to whatever color of headband you want! Then lets face it, if you buy all of these on their own they are twice as much as these and then you have to find and purchase headbands!<br /><br />The flowers do come in a variety of colors. Although I didn't receive what was pictured, I still like them.  I had no repeats on the flowers or headbands. All of the colors matched a headband! The clip that clips it to the head band or to hair is made good! Some had a few pieces of glue on them from the accent center crystal but is easy to take off.<br /><br />Overall any age group could wear these, with or without the headband. They all are the same flowers just different colors, same goes for the headbands!
B00KFP91VE|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00E1E5MWC|3|good
B00M7XTGGW|4|runs small, but I read reviews so luckily I went a size up. besides that i love it. everybody assumes it's a real triangl (lol) and it's comfortable. only took a star off because the straps are too complicated to take off and on regularly, and the snap in the back has worked fine so far but I'm afraid of how cheaply it's made. But for the $12 I spent on this, totally fine with me:)
B006X12JPO|5|Love um snug strong long lasting support and great length.  I would buy these again, yes I would, I sure would
B006ZH82MU|5|These fit perfect. I wear a 28 size pants and ordered a small. If you are a 29-30 I would definitely go with a Medium. For a 26 year old man I have suffered with this problem my whole life and it is painful to sit down for extended periods of time. This product may not solve that problem totally but it is so much better now. I would definitely recommend to other people. I have two pairs now and I have been wearing these for about a month and a half.
B0056H9CX8|4|Suggestion -- Put something on the front so a child knows which is the front and the back of the underwear.
B00M34UCAO|5|👌
B00CBA8FU4|5|A good costume. I'm 90 lbs and 5'1 and purchased an Xs. I would buy it again. Decent material not itchy!
B004WKTGLS|2|THEY FIT TIGHT BUT KEEP YOU WARM THOUGH..ITS OK..JUST VERY TIGHT PUTTING ON...THEY KEEP MY LEGS WARM AND THEY ARE THICK
B001VH6W3A|5|These socks weren't cheap, but I have enjoyed wearing them and they have held up well.  They are soft and moderately thick.  And after 6 months or so of wearing and washing they have retained their dark color.
B000ZBUXLK|5|Nice rich colors.  Appears well made .
B00LP9KFMS|5|Great shorts, great price.
B00L62CHF2|5|Great for a gift during winter season.
B00BH0NER8|2|The dress was cute. The fitting was a bit small. The headband came in broken. It took awhile for the package to come, due to weather conditions. so I had no time to reorder or buy another one.
B00LHZNEGE|5|It's such a great deal!! For 70% discount, is definitely worth to buy!! The quality is good and the hoodie was detachable so it was very convenient to take it off or wear it, will be fashionable!! The navy blue color is beautiful. Not too dark color. I just love it!!
B002AQ286Q|5|fit great and look great. gives you that professional look.
B00S4ZWEAC|4|These are great for the price. The calves are tight where the mesh meets the legging. I would say I have average calves (5' 10&#34; 140 lb) and while tight its not enough to bother me. I can run in these without them falling down.
B00D458C7Q|1|Will not but from China again! Sizing is not right! This would for a pre teen not for adult wear
B00PIWUEAQ|4|so comfy!
B00LUBKEKY|5|Love it
B00CMC7X4K|4|I wear a 12 1/2 sho size. I fall in the sock size range but still a bit snug. I have found the 13-15 size fit better. Love Gold Toe.
B0001LCPNS|1|sheepskin mittens were cow hide attached to synthetics wool woven into a thin fabric. Seller did not refund the shipping.
B00U9R4B2W|5|I absolutely LOVE this tank top. The material feels smooth and it fit perfectly.
B003JMCUAO|3|I got this hat for my boyfriend and he adored it! The reason why it came out to 3 stars and not 5 was because the shipping was incredibly delayed and it took well over a week from the estimated delivery dates before I actually got it, which kind of sucked because I almost missed his birthday. I am satisfied with the present and he does not take it off, but I am disappointed with the shipment.
B0110MZESO|5|Perfect fit of shirt and very nice looking. I would order again.
B00JAO3VOY|5|My shirt fits great. It's the exact color and size that I chose.
B00NHGN5UQ|5|good
B00JIH7DPG|3|Nice quality but fit is large for a slim cut. Plus they do not have an adjustable so they don't fit my son.
B00AHTK6F8|2|This is the second time that I have ordered a Champion bra on Amazon and it has been too small. I ordered XL for 38C. It has been awhile since I bought a Champion sports bra, but I had comfortably fit into a large. The last Champion sports bra I bought on Amazon was a large, so I thought surely if I bought a size bigger, it would fit. When I first tried it on, I thought that it would be okay, but after wearing it all day, my skin hurt. Not going to try anymore Champion bras.
B001MVGRAI|5|I gave these as a gift.  I thought they were very cool looking.  I would definitely buy again.
B004M6UDC8|1|Hmmm...You get what you pay for. This was a great wallet while looking online but when I got it. Then I got the surprise. Looked like something from dollar store.<br /><br />Save your money.<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Anthony Kakos
B00BP4QOKU|5|I love this bathing suit. The cups sizes are pretty accurate. Maybe a little big. Bottom has a lot of coverage. Front has good coverage without looking granny. I took a bunch of pictures for my sister who wanted to get it, so I figured this might help some people. I did lose my shoulder straps, so you have more options for looks with those on. For reference, I am typically a 30D/E in European bras and like a 30/32 B/C in regular bras.
B000BROCGA|2|OK hat but not as useful as I wished.  Material is very light weight.
B004UMIUB0|5|great
B00MURIFWQ|5|I loved it.
B00D6COJYW|5|Nice fabric but tighter than a 3 x should be. Flattering.
B00GRIZZUE|1|It says one size.... maybe if you're a zero!
B000ZPNM1E|5|I needed an inexpensive, comfortable undershirt for work. I am a girl and most tank tops that would fit under my shirt are too low cut. I decided to get these shirts instead! They are a great fit! They are inexpensive too, which is nice. The four pack makes it so I don't have to wash them as often. I got these shirts in a medium and they are snug without being restricting. They hit me right at the hip, which is perfect for tucking them in. They don't bag under my clothes because the fit is nice and snug. There is no tag in the back to irritate my skin! Overall, these are perfect! :D
B00BLB93IM|1|Was nothing like the robes in the hotel. Was huge! No other sizes were available and the robes in the hotel fit perfectly.
B009OKPUVG|5|I love these, they are adorable. They fit true to size and look like jeans with all the comfort of a legging.
B00EKR6VIE|4|But the worst transport took 2weeks only in US.
B007G0TWI8|4|This assortment of bikini underwear has exceeded my expectations. Fruit of Loom is a trusted, high quality brand. Its comfortable, stylish and fits perfect. I highly recommend this product
B0068DHBBY|5|I've been looking for cute & comfortable panties with little visible panty line and also ones that won't break the bank.  I've tried several that claim to have no VPL, but so far these are the best.
B00IRBUZK4|5|Great buy but I am size 36c size 10 jeans and I got the XXL size. So make sure that you compare your size with what others have mentioned and with what the size chart says.
B00CMNTSQ0|3|This is a very pretty bra. Unfortunately, the cups ran small for me.  It did have good support
B00PVXZEW0|5|Perfect
B0018OFIUY|2|I don't know what is going on with these jeans about the logo being missing from the red tab on the back pocket.  You see other purchasers have noticed the same thing so I am not the only one.  I did not notice the reviews and comments until after I received the jeans.  Either amazon needs to look into this to see what is going on.  Also the logo was blank on the size tape.  I sent them back.
B001H0FVB0|5|These Levi's are going to be a gift but I know they will be of good quality and will be what he will wear.
B00NBWVNO6|5|Delivery was slow but overall the hoodie was nice and worth the wait
B009CTU9U6|5|For a guy who goes to the gym a lot, finding shorts that fit my thighs (squats do quite a lot to expand your legs) is a real trial. However, these seem to always fit my thighs just right! And the cut is very flattering even though I'm in my thirties. So I don't feel like I'm THAT old looking in these. It really is the &#34;Perfect&#34; short in many ways.
B00S68B2SC|1|This fabric is so thin I think it's thinner than coffee filters. it's way too small! I bought LARGE and my sister who's size O barely fit in it. I could stretch it out on belly but it would look pathetic. Horrible quality and not worth it - going back!
B001OCMA0Q|4|Fits a bit bigger.. Really need to pull in the drawstring for it to stay up. 30 inch waist and 41 inch hip. Needed a medium. Besides that, it looks exactly like the pic. Fits me about mid thigh or so.
B00GLL89LO|4|But sleeve is short
B002QC4T4S|4|Shipped quickly and in good condition. I have relatively smaller hands for an adult but they seem to fit comfortably and are flexible enough for someone with larger hands. Only 4 stars because of wear and tear after only 2-3 days use (loose threads) but with a quick repair with a needle and thread they're back in good condition. Would recommend for anyone needing exposed finger gloves with optional mitten.
B000FLAXRO|5|I try to use it everyday for my rough dry Hands. Because I am constantly washing my hands, I would like to try to keep them soft and Burt Bees is the best. Thank You very much.
B00OB9FEXY|5|nice
B00GHUK8RM|5|I bought these scrubs in three colors I was a little weary cause in past scrubs are often run small so i read the reviews and ordered a size larger. When I got them in there a little big but very roomy and comfortable . The quality is good, they wash well with no shrinkage and the colors are bright . Absolutely a great product for the price/ I love them so much I ordered two more sets.
B00MNGO2WG|4|Bought it as an extra large and it didn't fit.  I'm going to resize it to fit my little niece.  Very pretty.
B004M6XUI2|5|I need not write much since there's not much to say about it. It's a very good wallet for the price and worth every penny. The red cross on the front broke off within 1 day of actually using it. Now it is just a silver cross emblem which in my opinion looks a lot better. Everything you could want really. Plenty of slots for all your cards and the flip up ID thing is nice. Doesn't get annoying like I have had it do on other wallets. 2 Kinda tight openings for cash but I'm sure they'll loosen up with use. Unless you fancy fine things or wasting money. This is the best wallet you're going to get for the price.
B00XKXO4NS|5|Great fitting jeans. Looks great, feels great.
B005MGEY2W|3|The fabric is super soft, but thin. They are probably not for cooler nights. On the other hand, diaper changing is a breeze since the fabric has some stretch in it. Similar to another reviewer's experience, the zipper was a little sticky on the first wear, although it did get smoother over time for us.<br /><br />The feet on these are small compared to other brands. We bought the 18-24 month for our 16 month old. While they still have some room for her to grow into length wise, the feet are the same size as the 12-18 month footies she currently wears, which are from an assortment of other brands. As a result, her heels are on the fabric that makes up the main body, which doesn't have the anti-slipping material.
B00L2MD1WY|5|Looking forward to our first Padre game we go to this year so he can wear it.
B00H7VE18W|2|looks nice but not exactly practical. The cloth material around the grommets quickly began tearing out. Maybe i got the wrong size but I can't get the perfect tightness. The right fit is somewhere between the grommets. So in the end, I have no use for this belt.
B00TV0U3FM|5|Good
B000Q4W12U|5|My husband has had a pair in red for years and we have finally got him another pair.  He is looking forward to get the black in his size too.
B002XV45BE|3|Very itchy material, so I kind of stop wearing it.
B009A8629G|4|Very good
B000A38ZXG|3|This item is nice but its not top of the line so if you dont want to spend a lot this item is good but if you have the money buy the better one.
B003GD2PFQ|4|The socks seem pretty good at first glance.  They are very thin, but for 6 pairs of socks instead of 2 or 3 pairs of the leading brand, you can't beat it.  They serve the purpose of using them in skeletoes shoes.
B00OOEOAEA|5|Warm, comfortable, nice and thick.  Fit best in looser shoes.  Work well alone as lounge socks, too.
B003TQL34E|4|Great mask, however, it does run a little big and I have a big ass head. However, I just put one of the pads from the inside of my Army helmet at the top, so my eyes are level with the holes.
B0042UF8QA|1|unfortunately my wallet arrived ripped, but the sellers were prompt in refunding me.  It is a nice colour, but smaller that it looks in the photo, i.e. paper money would have to be folded to fit.
B00LCFPP4I|5|Very soft and comfortable. They fit great! They were a little pricey but nice
B004TDAH9S|1|I would've love this monokini but the size is way too small, I'm usually size xs or small and ordered the small but I can't believe that it almost didn't get up my butt I'm Asian and I dont have that much on my behind but this is unbelievably small, I dont know how they measured this, this would prolly fit a 9yrs old but too sexy for a kid...and I have to waste my money cause I have to pay shipping to return this, as much as I want this monokini I wouldnt take the risk of ordering this again since I can't return it for free If medium is still small on me, ugh waste of money waste of time, would not recommend to anyone!!! first horrible experience with Amazon, Im sure its not Amazon's fault it's the seller...
B004CO4DDU|4|I like these briefs because they are cotton and they do not ride up.  I will order them again for sure.....  they are so very comfortable
B00JYKKQJC|5|Great hat and will fit my grandson for awhile.very cute
B00PIAPQUG|3|It's not bad but I would order like two sizes up. I'm a 34B and I ordered a C cup and it was still too small. Good concept but just go larger.
B00ENU1HUA|5|Finally a slouch beanie that fits my husband's large head, with enough slouch leftover!  Make sure you read the reviews before buying any of these slouch-type hats first, as a majority of these hats online are photographed on very small mannequins and dont fit as shown. Got the gray as a gift for him and he loves it - loves the knit detail and fit. Fast shipping.
B00T6HX1JK|5|This swimsuit appears to be excellent quality and is very comfortable.
B00F1B8C3U|5|We live in ND, and my husband doesn't like the form-fitted underarmour that is so prevalent here. He prefers to wear pajama pants under his clothes. That's why I purchased these and he treats them like long underwear. And of course, since he's a comic book nerd, this is even better. Everything was as expected.
B007OX0FX8|5|very soft and comfy to sleep in
B004JLZIWQ|3|Beautiful shirt, but there was a hole in the side seam!
B004RLBW1O|5|I needed something light, as I don't need additional heat.  It fits as described and I was pleased that it was comfortable, unfortunately I need steel of armor to hold it all in.  I will settle for SPANX.  Gals that need some help to keep the dress lines smooth will like this.  I received it almost over night with no problems.
B00VK2K8Z4|5|Best panties very.
B0093KV2UU|5|Arrived super fast. The green is darker than pictured, & the gold is very noticable.
B001AWXFY0|5|I had to replace the first pair, and it was an easy choice. These are best khaki pants I have had. If you want a pair of great khaki pants you should really consider these.
B0075AW63M|2|I am 5'7 and 120 pounds. I ordered a small and found it to be a tad bit large. I think an extra small would have been perfect, but the price was so affordable that I didnt care to return the dress. I loved the fabric but didnt like how the back and front didnt match up in the print. I felt it was sloppy of the company to not align the print together in the correct manner. Will wear it, but its not my ultimate favorite.
B00FL2PBV0|5|Looks and fits exactly as shown in phito
B008QY4PNK|5|with thgis product no problem, everything is fine, only waiting for courier box send the packet, thank you very much.
B0034G67G8|5|I used to buy the Hanes version of these briefs. Hanes no longer makes them. Fortunate to find that Fruit of the Loom has a similiar shape and quality. VEry comfortable. Be sure to order the next size up if you like a comfortable fit. I am a 38 waist but order the XLarge.
B00076ZRBY|1|They switched out the order. This is clearly a short sleeved tshirt but they sent me two sleeveless shirts. What's up with that?
B00A1EMUAI|5|perfect fit
B00CSKDNUO|5|I like it.it is very  good.<br />The quality and workmanship is very good.I am very happy with them.I am very happy with them
B001C8WBE2|2|I have been wearing these panties for a long time, and always loved them. They are the most comfortable undies I've ever had, but I now refuse to buy them due to poor quality.  The last 3 or 4 packages of these panties that I have purchased (from Walmart) have all had problems with the stitching around the elastic coming unraveled, and breakage of the elastic, all within just a few washings. A couple pairs I only wore twice before they came apart.  I contacted Hanes with my complaint, and they sent me 2 replacement packages. Those also fell apart in a short period of time.  It's a shame, because I really love the feel and fit of these panties, but I just won't keep giving my money to a company that has such poor quality. I know they are inexpensive, but I don't feel that is a justification for having to buy new underwear every couple of months.
B005WUILSG|4|My gift was a success and the color looked great on her. I am not usually a good grifter but the reviews helped
B007JX7Q9Y|5|This is a great style for .... &#34;muffin tops&#34;....I hugs where there is no bulges and flares out where they are.....It is a flattering style....The material is quite thin but they are making them this way for layering......I like the blue....It is not transparent....
B0095VQCFC|5|very satisfied.
B009ZRKQW6|3|Top was nice, but it ran a little small IMO. I think it is based on Asian sizing, which I definitely am not.  So if you're petite, you may really like this.
B00DVJQKQK|5|Loved how fast it got here and loved the perfect fit of the gloves. They defiantly have helped me with my carrying really heavy items that did a number on my hands and now with these gloves I don't even get all the marks in my hands that I used to. Defiantly advise buying from this seller
B007WA4CZK|3|The dress fit perfectly, but the hem was really ugly and cut off, it looked unfinished so I had to hem the dress to make it look better,
B0040ZFFSI|3|This bag shipped promptly and is decent quality.  I would have rated it a 4 if the top cover piece would zipper or velcro closed.  The cover is simply a piece of material with latches and no sealing of the side.  It is very easy to have items spill out.
B00EOYKEEA|5|Nice and exactly as advertised.  Bought a spare to put away in case it's unavailable.
B004ZKR68K|4|I like the colors and design. I bought this for my father for father's day. I would recommend this to anyone who likes these kind of socks
B008JXGJU0|4|This coat has very short arms, which on me are perfect. This never happens when I buy a non petite item, the sleeves are always at least 2 &#34; too long.  For reference I am a size 10/12 Top 5 ft 2 with short arms. The large fits me perfectly in chest width, sleeve length & overall coat length.  It's almost as if this coat is a petite cut.  On the average height women this coat may well be too short all over.  It's an attractive cut, giving a shape to the body & it has a lovely oversized hood that you can adjust the depth of.  The faux fur is nice & soft & looks rather good.  The only Con so far for me is that the feathers do work there way through the lining and until you can pull them they show as a white dot. It's not greatly obvious but I notice it.  Overall a pleasing coat at a good inexpensive price. I would buy again.
B00LBBTVOS|5|Great quality and fits perfect
B00JJUXBY4|5|Loved the jacket and the price.  The ring wasn't what I expected
B007V4W7HM|5|Comfortable & cool. Would order again! Need multiple colors.
B00JLAYWEU|5|very good!
B00K8274I6|3|not a great overal fit.. I removed the buttons and it fits better across the bust area
B00KCZ0EHM|5|So cute! Fits great!
B009ANVK20|4|Like other viewers mentioned, the inner strap is the same size as the outside strap and puckers. My friend had to put a safety pin in place in order for the strap to lay flat. I will eventually get it altered. Besides the strap, this is a very nice sexy black dress. I got plenty of compliments on it. I would recommend this dress but just understand you will probably have to get the straps altered.
B000RWNC10|3|Great item, got it quick like it  fine. Nicely made item does the job. Welcome addition to my collection. Thanks.
B004RJ0FWI|4|I like this bra better now that I have lost a few pounds.  It gives good support with slight cone-like shape, but its better than saggy!  I was a 40 DE when I bought this bra and it was tight but still wearable.  I would definately recommend this bra for support.
B00XLLQVGC|4|I really like this top!
B00OHDZ1Z0|3|It's not my #1 go-to dress for a casual day. It is a little snug and be careful when walking. No long strides in this dress! However, it's a universal piece. I can dress it up with some wedges or down with flip flops.
B00LCX4QJK|1|I hated it it did look anything like the picture. The fabric was cheap overall don't buy it & it took way too long to get here.
B009G6LU8A|5|Tokidoki Tee shirt fit so nice and comfortable to ware. I love the design on the T-shirt and always get compliments =)
B0006IXC8S|5|Love this split leg slip. Wore it with all my summer dresses and had no chaffing!! Love how it separated thighs and smooths all imperfections on my behind !!
B007R8T7SO|5|The cap arrived in excellent condition and arrived on time.  It also fits as expected and is worn often by owner.  Thanks!
B001D05Z88|4|These were a gift, for my son, I was very pleased with the quality as he was. He wears them a lot and they look good with navy suit blue shirt.  Would recommend.
B00D4B7TEM|4|I looked sharp in my good friend's wedding thanks to this delightful vest and matching gear.
B00CC2H0VQ|5|Perfect !!! Did as I expected ! I ordered up 2 sizes and it's just how I like !
B00S70YM6S|5|Super cute, nice fabric but runs really small.. At least 2 sizes smaller than I was expecting.
B00B80R0V8|5|Fits great, works wonderful, 10/10 would buy again. Used for snowboarding and glacial ice climbing
B007ECBSUS|3|This dress is very cute, I've gotten a few compliments on it.  However the stitching is not great.  The first time I wore it strap started to come free in the front.
B00AYKQ5AA|4|These pjs are the most comfortable I've ever owned.  I wish you can try them on first because Amazon won't take them back if you open the package...now I'm stuck with great pjs that are too big, but very comfortable!
B00H8AKDG6|5|This is an awesome product and it was worth the money. They fit vey well, especially the waist band which is so comfortable. And the service was excellent
B0087OU998|3|Love Under the Nile clothes (and their burping clothes) but did not love this fleece onesie. It's super thick so great for the winter/cold months. But the soft fleece is only on the outside- the inside is hard/stiff and scratchy so not good to wear if it touches your baby's sensitive skin. I guess if you're in the snow and want to put your baby it in over another full onesie it would keep your babe warm but forgot using it as pjs. Unless you're living in an igloo.
B00WJ42LO8|5|SUPER STRONG SUSPENDERS , BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.<br />GO FOR IT
B00OHD6CEE|3|The skirt was so short that I can't wear this dress... I was hoping to wear this dress to my boyfriend's birthday but after trying it on I knew I better look around for another dress. I'm 5'1 not that tall and the top was like material that halloween costumes are made of.
B00S6YG65A|5|Those Jeans are great. They go well with boots. they dont feel like tight jeans but look quite tight though.<br />i usualy order 34-36' in waist of levis jeans. but in those i ordered 36 abit wide. if those were in scretch brand of theirs i would order 34' waist.
B001CLFKKQ|5|Great styling as always from Anne Klein. Light-weight sturdy material is both water repellent and warm. Medium was a classic size 8-10. Unbeatable at this price!
B00BWKXF22|2|Our son wears 18 -20, however, these run extremely small and are nowhere near what 18 - 20 is from other manufacturers.  Anticipate this mnfg 18 -20 to be closer to a 12 - 16.
B0046XK4BM|5|Well made
B0045H0L1W|1|Most of the lights did not work.
B00LP812T4|4|It looks great on my husband and feels just right.
B00HT1407C|5|Great
B00EOB77P2|5|Can hardly get Me out of them since I got them I LOVE them so much!!!!  They are so comfy and surprisingly warm too for as lightweight as they are.  I imagine they will be great sweatpants for all seasons!  Did I express how much I LOVE these!!!!!  and am so happy to have found them I have been looking for a pair like these for a very longtime!  Hard to find style with such comfort as these!
B000QAS2SG|5|Fair price for a great item. Perfect for my needs. A++++ Seller. &#34;
B000JS30ZU|5|This is a beautiful bra. I was fortunate to find one on sale at nearby Macy's. It is best to try this on before purchase . One size larger than usual was the correct size for me. Pretty lace. Built like a fort. The fishnet lace which goes around the back is practical, because it is soft and allows a pleasant feeling of air flow. A +
B00PG7V8O4|1|The material feels 'rubbery' and after putting it on my hands were black from the ?dye, ?ink.  The material felt like it might be a 3D printed dress. I returned it
B006YL7N4K|4|Must handwash these. I have a big but for being a small girl and these fit okay, but not  the way in the picture.The lace goes under my butt, rather than over. A cute panty, just made for small girls.
B002ATXZSI|4|Had bought these pants for years from a brick-and-mortar chain department store's site, because I knew that I would get what I expected easily. The past few pairs have varied wildy in size, style, and country of manufacture, and I have begun to doubt whether I have been buying the genuine article.<br /><br />I feel a bit more confident buying from Amazon...the pants actually seem to match what is described on the Dockers website. And with the ease that I was able to exchange the pants I ordered, I see no reasure to return to that brick-and-mortar or it's site.<br /><br />All that aside, they are a good pant if you are in a &#34;polo & khaki/business casual&#34; work environment....
B008RJKPZG|5|`Very well made and very cozy fabric.  These were a gift for my grandchild who lives far away...so it was easy to buy online
B001LDVADG|5|WOW! Everyone here is very impressed with the quality of this suit. I didn't tell them what the retail cost was, and they assumed I spent quite a bit on it. The fabric, cut, and tailoring are what someone would expect in a suit costing 5x the price. Many thanks
B00RR07HR0|5|My 2 year old son loves this shirt. He puts up a fight to take it off when it needs washing. Great quality, and holds up really well to frequent washing and drying.
B00286BKO4|2|Based on the size chart, I bought a large of this bra.  After washing/wearing, it shrunk and is pretty tight, especially on the shoulder/neck area.  Other bras I've purchased of the same style are much more comfortable and did not shrink like this one.  I really like the style of this nursing bra, but this one is not really of great quality.  I would probably buy another brand before I got this one again.
B008KCK0H8|5|It was my husband Christmas gift and he love it perfect fitting and I'm glad I got it
B0098JUMDY|5|Loved all the leggings, the colors, the texture, perfect!!  Size perfect!  Arrived quickly and it was exactly what I expected, wanted, and needed, YAY!
B00KA4A6Q4|4|The fit was good,it is on the thinner side fabric wise...& THERE IS NO COLLAR I REPEAT THERE IS NO COLLAR lol
B008N0G6PC|5|This t-shirt get multiple compliments and comments every time I wear it.  I love the soft cotton feel and it fits great!!
B00JBZPCDA|4|Looks great but a little tight.
B008726ZQ6|3|The pants fit fine but the shirt was way too small.  I ended up buying a button down &#34;sateen&#34; shirt on the cheap and sewing the sleeves buttons and tie from this outfit onto the new white shirt.
B0026P45S0|2|I have had this same bra in the past and loved it. Seems like they have changed the sizing as the band on this was very tight even on the loosest clasp. The fabric didn't even feel as comfortable. I bought 2 and returned both of them.
B00ZHRTWWI|5|Best kept secret on Amazon! Buy these, you won't be disappointed!!
B00L83VCIC|1|Terrible product.
B00AMB04D0|5|Baby was 9lbs. When she was born so it was big but still looked very cute and she's worn it up to 6 months and it stretches so it still looks great.
B007TR14TS|3|Overall it fit as expected, but this shirt in particular shows too much chest with its design.
B00B8U9Z4I|3|Tight fit. Had to break these in over the period of a YEAR, and even then they were very snug for my (average) foot!<br />Good quality leather, though, great arch support, and quality leather that lasts. No pleather or PVC, quality construction. But ohh, the pain!!
B0078AT1GE|5|This is a very high quality made jacket. What else do you expect from Carhartt? With the quilt flannel in-lay this jacket is perfect for cooler weather.
B00IRZ3WRS|3|The dress is very pretty, but I ordered a medium and Us size, I'm 5`3 and 125 pounds but it didn't fit.
B00I8N7914|5|This was a gag gift for our 18 yr. old grandson who still loves Sponge Bob.  As he is off to college this fall, we all got a good laugh.  But he did say, they were a bit snug in the waist, and he is 6'2&#34; and lean.
B003AYSSPW|5|When you have tried so many Thigh Highs, YOU  soon know quality when you get them. This fits that bill very nicely!
B00HM4N018|5|Delivery estimate was accurate. Fits well. Pretty sturdy. I just got them so we'll see how they quality they are in the next few weeks. Overall, satisfied.
B001HQRBPS|5|This hat is very well made it looks good very nice fit I love the snap brim will buy again I will be getting one in gray and one in brown. I love the way the New Yorker looks and Scala makes an excellent Fedora.
B005SOX1IG|2|I love the picture of this top.  If only it actually looked like I would have kept it. On me it was short, boxy, and transparent in a not-good way.  Instead of tunic length, it hit high hip. It was really wide, too.  Overall, not worth the price, I sent it back. It had great potential, but just wasn't working.
B00LP90YOM|5|My fiancee loved them because they were warm and soft.
B001A5NLZ0|5|I just love this shirt and also love the walking dead. Was very happy with my shirt that I ordered my sister one to. Delivery was very fast order Monday and I got it Wednesday.
B00K4TITCI|4|These jeans are true to size but I ale ordered them in a different color (commodore) and those were way too tight.  Although Amazons return policy is AWESOME!!
B00HQC8O30|2|It's not bad
B000NVTJHG|5|These sweat pants are quite warm and very comfortable. They are made a bit long but I have never found the extra length to be a real problem. I would recommend them highly.
B001FAV4CM|5|This is a well made low profile twill cap that is a good choice if you are looking for a cap without any logo.
B00K1LJS5G|4|Great style and quality.  I have a narrow face so it was a little too big but nothing a little change in hairstyle couldnt mask.  couldnt pass it off with just a ponytail though.
B00J971FDQ|4|Love these!! Finally yoga pants that are not tight on my ever growing belly. These are so soft and comfy, I imagine I'm going to be living in these pants. Highly recommend!!
B00N8NP9V6|3|Too tight. Order a size up. Its tight on the top but normal fit on the bottom. So you have to squeeze past the top to get inside it. Also has a weird shape to it. Doesnt compliment your figure but still looks appealing. Its OK.
B00K1C608I|3|the size of bakini too big
B004IG5JQ2|4|The socks didn't fit perfectly but I was looking for long socks, so that isn't a deal breaker.  Past that they are very comfy
B00LMJFIKU|5|my favorite jersey!
B000GWJALW|4|and nice costume.<br />Just as expected.<br />size was right.<br />We got this for a school thing for my daughter, several kids got the same costume and it looke very good.
B008KKPQZG|5|This is exactly as described.  It is lightweight yet warm (perfect for the San Francisco area in winter). Definitely a great fall/early winter coat for colder areas.  Also durable and a pretty coat.
B00N4LQ7T0|4|These dresses are incredibly well made! My girls and I have had several Ever Pretty Dresses and they are always well made and beautiful! If you follow the size guied and use the BUST as the most important measurement, it will fit! The ONLY problem we've had with fit is that if it's a dress with straps over the shoulder (such as this one) the shoulder strap is ALWAYS too long and slips off your shoulder to your arm constantly. We've gotten used to knowing that we will need to have that strap taylored when the dress arrives (usually less than $10 at the dry cleaner)... and the dress quality and price are worth that small inconvenience. Overall... we are always satisfied with and Ever Pretty dress!
B00HC7BITG|3|Quality good, size is very small
B00SV7CEQC|5|Make sure to know your measurements! This style does come over the hips a bit, which is exactly what i was looking for.
B00J2V8578|5|Good fit skinny jean but not too skinny. Leg opening good for boots flats or a wedge. The dark wash can be dressed up or down.
B00O19Z2E0|5|good material, great fit.
B00FA2O1AS|5|I'm very happy with the quality of this scarf, it is a nice warm investment. This is a great gift item for cold weather days.
B00A8CHSY6|5|Excellent product ! Just as described.
B00HR7JQ5Y|5|Best running socks I've had.
B009P28SDA|4|This isn't a problem for most but these are thicker than expected compared to most jeans.<br />Guess that means you get more for your money so to speak.<br /><br />They are very well made think I paid around $30 for them and the quality is definitely higher than that.
B0048WRX2E|5|My daughter saw these online and really wanted them. I was nervous at first since they are clothing but they came quickly, right size, and no damage. Price was great as usual too. Thanks. She loves them.
B0057DPWMG|5|Perfect
B00O3KHELQ|5|Great
B00MIBEBAY|3|Dress is very pretty but feels really cheap. Tag is not in English...so no instructions on how to clean. Also took forever and a day to receive this item.
B00GWGX6BQ|4|Great product with excellent quality. It is what I expected. I received it in the expected time in the right place.<br />I recomend this product.
B004Q1H5P2|5|Wear them all the time
B00551NM5Y|5|I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter.  It was her favorite birthday present.  Very well made and fits her well.  Loved that it has a hood.
B003ZJH6Z0|5|i love these jean but they are a bit larger than expected.  still they are mad soft and comfort
B008OA0LNE|3|I bought these to wear under a dance outfit. They are a little small. Also I feel that the crotch area was oddly cut. Never the less they are serving the purpose in which they were intended.
B00SADN0YM|4|It's a nice blazer.  It's spandex so it doesn't have that business look I wanted.  But, it will do.  I can wear it with jeans or throw it on with a skirt.  The seller was great as well.  I didn't know it was spandex and ordered a size too big.  I shipped it back and they processed my exchange with no problems and very quick.
B00GNFBUDM|5|Beautiful and warm.
B0094VP8VC|3|Item runs small.
B00CIIHQUO|5|Very nice shirt
B00NC197JY|5|Really pretty dress! Simple.just what i wanted. Got here way before expected day which was awesome. It does ship from China which is why it takes longer
B00KDF9JEU|5|Okay
B008CZ3NOA|5|These SpaSilk Baby-boy shirts are adorable.
B00D7WFNCI|5|Exactly what I was expecting!
B002BBRKBI|5|Loved the shape but they were a little too sticky and hurt my nipples when I pealed them off after 12 hours.
B000KI86Q2|5|It is Very comfortable !
B0009MZWGQ|5|Have used these every day for 15 years.  Very heavy and thick.  Size shoe accordingly but they will give your feet the protection they need.
B00DUDRLG0|5|Very happy with the shirts!!!
B00576QJSE|5|The price was great and it is a great quality coat. Just long enough but not too long. Easy to sit in wear over sweaters.
B00DDQX0XW|5|love it! very very comfortable and i love the pretty lace!
B00LGRLSLQ|1|So sad!<br />I am exited that the package was delivered on time. The quality of this product was not good as expected. It's hard to complain because of the price. However, I found a dirty spot on the white top. It's just so obvious an everything was ruined. It's such a disappointment. Don't recommend to anyone. Just a wast of money.
B002GHC2Z6|5|This jacket is extremely warm and fits very well.  It is a little stiff and I am hoping that it may soften up a little after washing.
B00DVHNSGW|5|My favorite shirt
B0011RP7FY|5|Good
B00ND0LVV6|4|Like this items for my grandson. Fits him well and would recommend this item to others.
B004D04F68|4|I received these pants very promptly after ordering. The fabric is soft, silky, but a little heavy. I leave in Florida, so very soon it will be too warm to wear them outside. They will work great for air-conditioned spaces. The color is nice, a neutral, delicate grey, going very well with any other color of the top. The reason I gave 4 stars to these pants is the cut, they sit little too high on the waist. The hip area could be just shallower. And I agree with one other reviewer, they are short. I will enjoy them and hope that in the future the manufacturer will modify the cut and produce them from the same fabric but in more colors.
B0009GA2SA|5|Very happy with the price and quality of this product, definitively will buy more of this brand, fits as expected and very comfortable
B00NINBV9K|1|This is not leather and it's sized for a woman. Order mens XL and it's like a woman's size 8 or 10 maybe.
B008HCV23W|5|I like it
B00FFBONPC|5|Very cute! My son loves this bow tie! He wants to wear it with everything. Nice quality and good workmanship.
B00E0WRX68|4|The weave is very thin. It breaths very well, but easily falls out of shape.
B00K2YP59U|5|The Shirt is funny and my son love it - grandma too
B00GPKSK5Q|4|Cute sweater!! I ordered a large and I just wish it would go over my chest a little bit more (36D)...it hangs slightly awkward. I read other reviews from people with large chests who said it fit great...I would say it doesn't quite fit true to size. Will keep for a wear around the house sweater.
B00CXE4LVK|5|This shrt is beautiful but it runs large and was returned  because it was not complimentary due to the largeness.  Seller very graciously accepted the return and I highly recommend seller and this shirt.  Just remember it does seem to run a bit large and take that into consideration when purchasing.
B000ENT6GC|1|The capris had a rip  in them and when I put them on the rip became a huge run down the lenght of the Capri leg.  I had already discarded the package so I just threw them in the garbage.  $18.00 wasted.  Save your money!
B00L3TVLNW|2|i returned these. they were cheaply made and didn't fit.
B00RCMVFO4|5|EXCELLENT
B00F59IRYW|5|Nice shirt. It was delivered quickly and fits perfectly. Definitely worth the price. I'm going to order some more of these in the future.
B001CVCMPW|4|Looks just like the picture. Material is very thin and it fits tight
B001H1PYD4|5|So comfortable I bought 2
B00CC7528E|5|Super cute dress. My daughter got so many compliments from our family and even strangers loved this piece. The best thing is that it doesn't need a diaper cover. You can partir out up with light pink leggings at nighttime
B000J2Z3VA|5|This is a must have for anyone who looks for this type of costume. If you're a hasher and need it for the red dress run, bear in mind it's a little bright red, almost pinkish. But it won me the RDR 2nd place in a tough competition! :))
B004LYCND8|5|The rain coat is heavier and cuter than I thought it would be. My grandaughter loves it!Would recommend it for any Thomas the Train lover!
B008H6NBDW|5|They look great and feel so comfortable!!! They are a great quality product. In addition, come in so many different styles.
B001ES8XGK|4|A Simple Petticoat that can be used to enhance a full circle skirt or dress.<br />I found it acceptable for the cost. It is on the lower end of the petticoat pricing range,<br />but perfect for what I needed. Once removed from packaging I had to stretch and fluff<br />its full potential.
B005CWNWTW|5|great
B003MNI496|5|I love these jeans. They're gradually becoming a favorite of mine. The wash pairs well with most of my outfits. It also maintains its stretch very well and accentuates my curves. As another reviewer said, they are long and will need hemming, unless you plan to pair them with heels.
B00574M4SK|5|Very comfortable to wear. Lessens the odor of my feet. worth the price.
B00SIGDXG6|5|fits very well. My husband liked it.
B000E95ZSO|1|Put batteries in it. Pushed up on the switch and it fell the f@&$ off. I'm out the goddam money.
B00I2UFDMK|5|Good quality
B00PDHI1A6|1|Poor quality
B004WY8OVM|5|Excellent price, quality and service!
B00821ROVM|5|Beautiful color.  Wish it is a little bigger -at least one inch more (1&#34;) Thanks  I love it . I guess I need to loose a little weight
B00LJRXIRA|5|This actually looked like a more expensive hat to me when I saw it in person. Seems to be good quality. Cute. Only thing I don't like are the &#34;stylish&#34; rios on the end of the brim. I knew that when I got it though. I don't like rips as a fashion statement but overall the hat is cute.
B00E3GM028|5|I love it!  It's comfortable and fits just right! I will definitely do it again.  Maybe walking dead next time.
B00J377S0Q|4|When I first got the shirt I almost gagged- these shirts SMELL! I got two from this seller and both smelled to high heaven of vinegar or something unpleasant. I had to seal them in a plastic bag so they didn't contaminate my room while I waited for laundry day. Fortunately said smell did wash out! (Though I washed them twice to be safe before wearing).<br />After that the fit is good, no other complaints.
B00IAZR7IA|5|I've been wearing the &#34;Frickins&#34; since the late 1990s.  The new material is awesome!  If you are a Volcom shorts veteran like me, order one size smaller then your old school shorts.  The stretch allows them to be snug and comfy so you don't need a belt.  The Frickin shorts I currently own are over five years old and still hold up to my abuse.  I think its time for me to upgrade!  Cheers.
B00E8VGEQ6|4|great
B004ARTSNO|5|The Best Wallet Have Ever Owned!
B004W18ORO|4|Fits well, great construction. Very happy with it so far. Looking forward to many good years with this hat.
B00W6QG40G|5|Super comfy and very light weight. Love these pants!
B00M6MZ9DS|5|I bought it for myself, but my daughter took from me and she  like it thank you:)
B00T6IRKT6|5|I bought the shirt as a gift for my daughter, so I don't have much information.  I know she got it and was happy with it.
B002EPR0AM|4|A little heavy.
B0089F8G86|5|Third pack and they fit and last. They are true to size. I wear a size 13 and I have no complaints. Very comfortable and snug fit.
B00CUOYR2Q|5|I like a lot this was present for my supervisor, she is very happy she said I have a good taste
B008U7KS5W|3|I took the time to find the product I truly wanted.  I paid extra to get the &#34;Generous body length - stays tucked in&#34;; however, I received the &#34;contour fit&#34;, which costs less and is NOT what I wanted.  I am not happy.
B0080AFYT4|5|I have been looking EVERYWHERE for a pair of &#34;hunter green&#34; skinny jeans. Like, literally everywhere. I was almost ready to give up and drop $180 on a pair from OCJ Apparel, when I saw these, and ordered them immediately. They shipped right on time, and the quality is absolutely beautiful-- I didn't know denim could be so soft! I range from a size 0 to a size 2 in jeans and wanted to make sure I got the right size (I have very skinny legs, so buying pants for me is often a nightmare), so I went to Red Engine's website and looked at their sizing chart before deciding on a size 26-- which fit PERFECTLY...everywhere except the inseam. These jeans are perfect in every aspect except that, for some reason, the inseam is super LONG. I have to roll my pair up at least twice before I can go out in public. But these jeans were so hard to find, and I love everything else about them, I'm just going to take them in to a tailor and have them shortened. Definitely would recommend! (especially to those very tall, skinny-legged girls out there)
B007L9M84O|5|This wrap was PERFECT for my zombie bride Halloween costume. I have no idea why other reviewers thought it was child-size - I am 5'9&#34; and curvy and the wrap fit like a dream. The material was actually softer and nicer than I thought it would be - I was almost sad to cover it in fake blood :)
B00LFICW0M|2|The skirt appears cheaply made, did not fit in a flattering manner.
B001NXXJVU|4|I love this hat. But I have one concern. I used this hat on my recent trip to Caribbean and Florida. I should say that I was near the ocean most of the time and the hat flew off all the time :-( and I had to hold it so I don't lose it. So if it is windy out there you will have a tough time with this hat.<br /><br />The quality of the hat is good. The package arrived within 3-4 days. They have some nice stuff in their store but they are expensive.
B00E9Y51RA|5|Comfy and truly no-slip.
B00IFZKL7E|3|Is not large is big
B005C9GD6Y|5|Took a little long to arrive but fit perfectly
B0049H2H56|5|I ordered these specifically as they have the zip front which makes night time changing so much easier.  yes they are very light weight so they are a bit better suited for warmer nights. But I will layer a little shirt and some socks under it for a bit of a warmer outfit.  They are also great for during the day to have a play with on the floor in the morning.  The sizing was very accurate for my son which I greatly appreciated.  I would definitely buy more of this item.
B000N8X7BS|5|My son works in a metal shop, grinding, welding ect....  pants are a dream!  he broke the knee through regular jeans in less than a week, these are still working great, wash well too!  a little extra drying time needed or just hang them for a while
B00H8NJ6X4|5|Great fit.  Love these jeans
B00IKVU1YG|3|I returned it. Re-ordered 2 sizes bigger. Strong latex odor
B009ETEGE4|5|Buy it you won't regret it! It's delicate appearance and light weight with flowers gives it a fly away with me feel. Fun with a mix of vintage, sophistication, and creative appeal. She loved it when she opened the box! Mind you, she collects them and now Terra Nomad is at the top of her list.
B00NLMZ2HA|4|Bought this as a gift for my husband. His only complaint was that it didn't hold a ton of stuff, but that he overall loves it. He would go thru debit cards because they would crack in a regular leather wallet. The fact he won't have to order a new one every 6 months is his reason for 4 stars and not less.
B00CTHTIU0|5|Wow the most comfortable underwear if have ever worn. They are both soft, smooth and very breathable.  Simply the comfortable underwear if have ever worn.
B007GDTMI0|3|It's is a ok material but sizing it was off! A bit snug on chest
B00OX55GWA|2|My daughter loved the design but they were too small and she isn't really a large girl.
B002HWS7EU|4|Very good fit.  True to size.  Problem with length options.  This is my second pair and they also had to be adjusted because they were too long.
B00KGE524O|5|Fit my 2 year old. He is kinda big. Off the percentile chart for Height. Nice sleeptime outfit.
B00APJROO6|3|I wear a small in most brands, including Victoria's Secret, for example. I am not skinny, just a normal weight for my height and frame, if not several pounds over half the time. I read all the reviews about how small this runs and yet still ordered a small-my bad. It was VERY small and hard to try on. I returned it, of course, and went 2 sizes up to the large. The large pants were still tight and the top short on my 5'5 frame; I couldn't believe it. I then missed the return deadline so I guess I'm stuck. Perhaps I'll wear it if I am ever on the lower end of my weight range again or feel like lounging around the house in something snug. If you do decide to order, I would do so only if you are on the slim side and not too tall. The pants are long enough but the top seems a bit short-it might work better layering over a tee. The back pockets and slim cut of the pants make it a very cute tracksuit, but perhaps it is actually sized for teens or kids?!
B002XM7CC2|5|I love this...i had a bleach nerd moment when i saw it. Its an amazing zanpakuto replica, and it came to me in great shape..this was my first one and it wont be my last five out of five stars
B001BY1W88|4|My Husban wore this to my daughter's 4 year old birthday party.  He wore a white shirt under it and jeans like the picture.  We switched out for a bigger bandana (the one that came with it is very small; I put it on the dog)  The only real negative was the hat.  It was really bad... smashed, small, and cheep looking.  I did read some of the reviews so knew that ahead of time.  I would have to say this is worth getting for the price just know you will need a new hat.
B008ODX624|5|I have several different colors of these jeans and I absolutely love them. They fit true to size and are very stretchy so therefore very comfortable.
B007FZHFN8|4|One size doesn't fit all.. needs little more Velcro fasteners. but overall cute outfit. would recommend for any costume occasion
B009PN6O8U|5|Love it! Perfect size for me. Not to big, not too small. I use it for an everyday purse I have two kids so it's big enough for my stuff and their stuff as well. Durable and well made.
B00HJZL7EC|1|I weigh 125lb so I odere modiumbut it was way too small for me😳So I guess I need xl😰
B00H422ORE|4|These are on the larger side of 0-3 months with lots of room on the sleeves and the leg openings.  If you have a chubbier baby, these will be great!<br /><br />Pretty good quality.  Onesies laundered nicely - came out of dryer with minimal to no wrinkles.<br /><br />Adorable patterns although these would be luck cuter with some feminine detailing like a tiny bow, eyelet trim, etc.<br /><br />Overall, good value.  Offspring is affordable & holds up well.
B000O1WVDO|5|finally leg room, they are cut for the big guy..a good rugged work short.deep pockets , stuff stays down where it should be.
B0088MODUU|5|The pants were super clean and in awesome condition. They fit perfectly and the cut was modern and fashionable.. Shipping was perfect and right on time. I might not end up wearing them often but I could wear these at any casual event.
B0069CP3FU|4|cute and good size.<br />it looks like a gay but i like this item.
B004T3LWCE|4|good quality
B00V93XAYA|5|great purchase for any new baby, makes nighttime so much easier
B0081EMCIA|5|Looks great and fits him well.  The hood/lining can be removed for autumn weather and zipped back in for winter weather.
B00O3GVQ78|3|fairly small
B00JJJMLAU|4|it is soooo comfy and warm! i was really excited to find a gloomy bear version that wasn't super expensive. it's a knock off, so it's a little cheaper made and there's loose strings, but i was still very happy with it and my friends and family thought it was really cute.<br />i'm 5'5 and 158 pounds and the size was perfect: nice and loose. it also fit my taller and heavier sister and shorter lighter friend as well, so theres some leeway size wise.<br /><br />my friends really liked it and ended up trying it on and not wanting to take it off because it was so fun and warm.<br />im probably going to buy more of different characters! maybe for some christmas gifts too!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE:<br /><br />shipping took so long i actually forgot i ordered it, so it was almost like a surprise gift!
B006U1GXR2|4|It's a little bigger than I expected but super cute! I wish they made them in set sizes, newborn,0-3 etc
B005OS2S30|5|I love the military inspired coat. So comfortable and a great fit. The sleeves are not long and it hugs at the waist just the way i like it. Great coat wish it came in more colors.
B00BZS4T94|5|Great quality shorts - deep pockets, just below my knees and solidly constructed.  I wish they had more colors available....
B00GXW0UYK|5|They fit perfectly on me. They are a little stiff at first but will soften up. I like the fact that they are somewhat stiff when new. To me, it means half the life of the jeans hasn't been washed away when they're brand new.
B00HQLKI1M|3|Great
B004WPHTEY|5|This wig is amazing for clowning. It's thick and bouncy and comes to you the way it looks in the picture. For my use I barely bushed out and fluffed the curls. I did have have to give the bangs a hair cut. I took the bangs up about and inch. The bangs are thick so they could handle some texture to make then lay more naturally and not straight out. The wig is mostly cotton candy pink with medium blue here and there.  It does have red tensile type \\"hairs\\" here and there as well. Some of those came out when I worked the wig to fit my needs. I have only worn it once so far. But it was for 4 hours in 100 degree weather while I painted faces. I melted a bit naturally but the wig looks great still.
B00CALDXBU|5|My daughter did not like it when she saw it on the web.  She said it looks childish (maybe the model wearing was a young child.)  But, I bought it because I knew it would fit her well.<br /><br />I was right.  She loves to wear it, too.  It does not look childish on her but a bit feminine and elegant.  This time, Mommy was right!
B003DC8UBI|5|They are really good for volleyball they rise up in the back because I have somewhat of a big butt so this would fit great besides that
B00KS15W0O|5|Fits well and comfortable, minimizes the pouch, and does not create friction or cause one to sweat.
B0091365WY|4|I'm a small to average size guy by average american male standards.  This scrub shirt in a medium was too big for me though so I had to order an exchange for a small.  Other than that, its a good scrub shirt.  Just beware that this runs large in size.
B00CXOUBI2|3|I would have to wear something underneath to avoid having people see through the fabric.  The price did not match the quality of the garment.
B004JUNCI4|5|Not to thick and bulky. It has shape to it, but conceals flaws. The neckline is perfect. I have worn it and washed it a handful of times and I haven't had it a month yet. It washes well. Very happy with it.
B00FBD2G1C|5|Good
B00743GIU2|5|Good quality, long lasting socks!
B00DJM4VQU|5|Everything is good. :-)
B004QN36AS|3|I  don't  like these shorts.  The colors are nice, but they just feel cheap.  I think they are garbage.  Save your money
B00EJ7ZUVO|5|Great!
B0021D7TJE|4|I have not washed these yet, so I will see how they hold up, but they look and feel well made.
B00127ZF3W|2|I purchased this shirt to wear with suit and tie to work.  Upon receipt, the shirt looked to be of good quality for regular use.  The first washing, with like-colored clothing, produced a crisp, clean shirt.  The second washing produced a brown stain on the front of the collar which ruined the shirt.  I could have washed the shirt again but the stain appeared to be permanent, after drying, and the shirt was clean.  I requested a return of the shirt and was promptly provided a refund by Amazon.
B00DY7WY14|4|pretty darn cute
B0054DXFM8|5|Can't highly recommend enough, so cool dude!!
B00009OXE8|5|IT WAS REALLY NICE FOR THE PRICE, IT WAS A REALLY NICE COSTUME FOR MY BABY, IT´S NOT EXPENSIVE AND I LIKE COLORS
B00GBJI5VA|5|For the price I think that Kalon workout bottoms ( I have a few styles). I love the fit and the material. They are just overall amazing. I got them for less than $20 but they are worth more I am sure
B00JF0JT94|5|Switched brands; lees  fell good on.
B000J45N4U|4|These are lovely -- for cotton panties.
B00DVIT586|3|So the price was very low, but the quality was as well.  It's a cheap jacket for a cheap price.  Kept my daughter warm all season, so that's good, but it will never be a hand me down to my younger daughter.
B000AKEMB8|5|This is a really beautiful bracelet. The jade is a really beautiful green and shiny color. It is exactly as in the pictures. The beads size is also just right, not too big and not too small. I hope it will last a long time. But like the other person said, if it breaks and you don't loose the beads you can have it repaired.  The price? Well I'm not an expert but if they're real jade stones it's worth it. And it's beautiful so, yes it's a good buy.
B00FPQ459G|4|love the color and style, it fit on either side of my head,
B001AOL504|1|Didn't like the one I received in the grab bag.  I wouldn't recommend going with the grab bag purchase because you never know what you are going to get.
B005C5123W|5|The shirt fits as the auction information described; not to mention she loved her new Sheldon the Flash shirt!  Thanks!
B00PF9JWJG|5|very good!
B00E1OL46U|5|I read the reviews that this shirt ran small so I ordered 1 size larger than I normally would.  Well it doesn't run small.  The size I got is too big bud doable. Very nice shirt
B00A9KHB2Q|2|These things fit great while you're sitting.  But start moving around just a tiny bit (like, walking to the fridge from the couch) and they start to slide.  No big deal, but if you plan on wearing them for an entire night, expect them to stretch out to the point where they're just those scrunchy leg warmers that people wore in the 80's with jazz shoes.  All mashed up by your ankles.
B0000ZFRZ8|2|Runs showed on the first day of wearing.
B00N4QAP16|2|shoddily made. the piece that connects the headband to the ear muffs completely disintegrated and fell apart within one day of my wearing these.
B00IGVB0H2|5|My corset came about a month earlier than the EDD. when i first tried it on , i quicklybecame worried that it was too small but all i had to do was loosen the strings in the back. A lot of ppl complained in other reviews about the string being too weak but I think it's just right. Also, i'm about a size 5/6 my waist measures 30in and I weigh 140 lbs so the scale almost had me buying a Medium but since I wear a size small in most of my shirts I just went and bought a small and I love it! Putting on the waist trainer I can bring my waistline to 25 inches. I started off wearing it 2hours a day, then progressed to 4 hrs a day and currently I'm doing it for six hours a day now. (I'm wearing it now lol). I haven't been wearing it consistently though like everyday and stuff but I do workout 3-4 x's a wk So I'm hoping to see a major difference maybe within the nxt month or so.But for now I've noticed a slight difference.P.S. GREAT CORSET for the PRICE! strong,sturdy and ACTUAL STEEL BONES
B00APT8PW6|5|First off, the package arrived days before I expected it to in wonderful condition.<br />The bra itself fits perfectly, and is much sturdier and better quality than I had expected for such a reasonable price. For the longest time I had to spend upwards of $70-$80 dollars for strapless supportive bras in my size, so this was heaven-sent.<br /><br />The seller was fabulous and the item is exactly as described. It includes detachable straps in both nude and clear, which is always a plus.<br /><br />I am so beyond pleased with this item that I had to run to my computer and immediately upload a glowing review.
B008D6N6ZO|5|High quality, very beautiful.  Got lots of compliments!
B00E2X2CAC|5|Good winter gear.<br /><br />Hat and gloves fit fine.<br /><br />Well made product.<br /><br />Keeps my kids warm in the morning before school.
B000UG4JEC|1|I am 5'3&#34; and 198 pounds....I wear a size 16.... I can't even put this on as its too small! Posting is deceiving for size.
B00DRGZCNO|5|I tend to gravitate to bright neon colors for my running clothes--anything to help me be more visible while out on the roads. I just LOVE this top; it has beautiful feminine detailing and is good quality. The price was right and I love the way it fits. A great purchase!
B008OVMWK8|4|I got an XL because I have a 40DD chest, which is hard to fit in a tank-top style, but the Hanes Women's Ribbed Tank fits great and runs true to size. The length is 33\\", which I also like, because wearing it scrunched up around your waist creates a ruching effect that is very flattering. The hem is not stretchy; these are 100% cotton undershirts of the 1950's starchy variety, not soft, absorbent Peruvian Pima cotton. The tighter hemline is what allows the ruching effect when it's hiked up. The back at the shoulders is a tiny bit blousony, but I'm sure it will become more fitted after it shrinks in washing. These are also tagless, so no scratchy label at the center of your back.<br /><br />The all-cotton rib is thin and a bit sheer. You may not want to wear the white by itself.<br />By the way, the XL also fit my boyfriend, who's a 42 long, perfectly. Paired it with a an open button-down shirt.
B00A6G44R8|3|cheaper on ebay
B002TLTRWK|3|Disappointed that we were not sent set shown in photo, which is why we selected. Just wanted something simple and pretty for my young child. We received characters.
B00GWUT00I|5|really love the dress but it is a tad tight but I can still wear it, I am happy to say.  It is hard to guestimate your size with this kind of stretch fabric but I was afraid if I got large it would be too big.
B00BMDAMZ2|3|This shirt is ok.  I expected it to be of a little heavier material.  It's very thin, and you have to be very careful when washing it.  It is also really big.  It is way too big for my husband, even though I bought his correct shirt size.  I can't shrink it by putting it in the dryer, so I will have to take it in on the sides.
B003WE9A5W|5|THEY ARE THE BEST JEANS THAT I HAVE EVER HAD
B00RGT2F8I|3|The seems are only over locked not straight stitched so these tights are no very good for strenuous activity. Given the price I decided to have them sewn rather than return them. They fit well though.
B00OC7P7FA|4|Here's the deal.. I bought this for a costume. It's a little see through and sort of feels like swimsuit fabric. I am 5'6 and weigh 145. It's plenty long for me, but it's skin tight. Any smaller and it wouldn't work. It works for a costume, but I can't imagine anyone wearing this around. I bet it'd fall apart.
B00CRW5ZEK|4|I haven't been able to put this dress away yet- my daughter wears it right out of the dryer!<br /><br />Great color & fit. Not lined but for the price I didn't expect it.
B00553XI9C|5|The bra is super pretty and the material is comfortable, but the band is too large and the cup size is too small. I would definitely order this bra again if I can figure out the correct size.
B00F6A6RLK|5|Very comfortable.  Fit true to size.
B0085TGSO0|5|Best denim shirt you can buy.
B004OA7A82|5|Received this poncho just in time to give it to my son on his birthday. Fit him just right and he loves wearing it. Perfect for the random rainstorms we get during these months in South Florida. It folds right up and fits right in his back pack. The only con is that it doesn't have its own carrying case but overall a great purchase for the price.
B005V2V740|1|Not work with Foam LARP swords
B0002UCES4|4|This affordable product is excellent. I chose it because it was cheaper than all the rest alternatives. I think it works just fine; it is noticeable under tighter clothes, but in the first weeks it is perfect under t-shirts, with jeans, shorts, etc. It also works good for shorter persons.
B00HJ15JNQ|5|X small is my size in Hue leggings......except some washable suede ones that ran quite large last year.
B003IBWD6C|5|I go out for Halloween with my kids and grandkids. Each year I scare all the neighborhood kids but it's worth it. The mask is difficult to see through but it's worth it.
B00I7KFWIK|1|If you go to disney store online, you'll pay half the price for all of it shown. These people are ridiculous.
B009043DWE|5|This top is perfect for me - it sizes perfectly, and actually looks slimming - I wear it with a skirted bottom and I really like the silhouette I get out of it. I debated over size 14 and 16 (I am C cup - nursing mother - I wear a size 14 for tops and 16 for bottoms in clothes) and finally ordered the 14. I don't regret it. The bust is not tight and offers enough coverage. It is not snug at the belly (my biggest issue - I had two big babies and have a diastasis recti that really makes my belly bulge). The print is really cute and refreshing. I like the adjustable straps and the absence of underwire. Love it.
B00JUM8CPO|5|Really nice.  Wish all my t-shirts were of this quality!
B006ZU1KJO|4|I love the fit of this dress I'm 5'2 and 118lbs and this dress fit great - not too short but also hits above the knee so I don't look like a granny. :) My dress didn't have a hole in the center (that I've noticed)like one review mentioned but there is a seam that goes right down the center front. That's the only reason this got a 4 star. The way the dress lays you don't really notice the seam unless you were to sit down - but it's just a tad annoying to me. Agree with other posts great for dress down day or night out - I bought it to wear to a high school graduation. Also someone mentioned it didn't do anything for the small chested... my husbands first comment was \\"wow it makes you look like you have boobs\\", and I agree I was very happy with the way it accentuated that A cup boobs. Great dress for the price... other than the seam down the front.
B003EI8PIE|5|THIS WAS PURCHASED AS A GIFT THAT HASN'T BEEN GIVEN TO THE 10 YR OLD GIRL THAT I'M SURE WILL LOVE IT!!
B00ELPZRLM|5|My brother-in-law loved this shirt! What else can ypu get a man turning 70? Excellent quality to boot!
B0009WMGXS|5|My first impressive point was on the softness of the leather. My neighbor even complemented on the leather quality as I unpacked it.<br />Most importment to me was the ample number of slots (6) for plastic cards, then another 10 spaces within the plastic insert.<br />It's like a pocket suitcase. A very functional product. I will pleased with it.
B00FGC1EXY|5|Absolutely my favorite pants - plan to get in every color!
B00315H9NM|5|I got this wallet for my wife, It arrived quickly and beautifully wrapped in Coach tissue with a red bow AND a Thankyou for my business from the Seller! wonderful purchase.
B00ZQMNZGI|5|I liked so much that I'm going to shop another one
B0018OLHQ8|2|The Third Belt Loop From The Left Has Broken On The Last Three Pair That I Have Bought And I Do Not Wear Them To Work Only On My Days Off. Other Than That They Are Great Fit And Look.
B00IRE023G|4|Very comfortable. Would definitely buy again.
B00O9ZRNPC|5|Perfect<br />Love It
B00KZD9KXK|5|This is a very cute outfit. Would definitly recommend!!
B004BTZRCM|5|My boy love it
B000NZW3KC|5|good
B00VTPKPAA|2|The top fit perfectly. . But the bottom fit big in the front .
B007QZ9XUA|3|Not quite as soft as I was hoping - it's more of a stretchy thick fabric. The material looks nice and the seams/stitching is all acceptable. As others have mentioned, the torso length is on the shorter side, but it worked well for me (5' 7&#34;, bought an US-XS).
B00L16692K|4|My daughter really likes this jacket. I did buy a size bigger for her than she normally wears. I was hoping that the jacket would be bigger and she could wear it longer than a year or so. She really does like the design and colors of the jacket overall though.
B00MM3OEQ4|5|Just got this for my 4 1/2 year old it is big, and the train drags on the ground, but she loves it. The quality is Excellent!! I ordered her a different Elsa dress for halloween through Amazon, and then saw this one which is definitely a better buy. I would highly recommend this dress to anyone looking for a high quality Frozen dress, but make sure you measure your child first. The size 4 measure 29 inches from the shoulder to the bottom of the dress if that helps. Would buy it again but would go with a size 3 so that it isn't too long, but it is a simple fix. :0 )
B006KAEJRO|3|I would definitely say at arrival, this dress is stunning. I bought it for my 2 year old daughter who was to be a flower girl in a wedding.The dress was WAY to long for her, but the top fit perfectly, so we did some hemming and all was fine. The dress snagged at the wedding in the front, because this is such a soft dress I would never buy it for my 2 year old again if I could do it over. This dress is made for an older child. Other than that, the dress is stunning!The shipping was literally so fast I couldn't believe it! Great service! GREAT dress, just maybe not for a 2 year old IMO
B00ZMN4BBE|5|Good so far. Fits my wrist perfectly. If it holds up to daily use I may consider buying another in the future. Shipment was prompt as well.
B005N3TQEA|4|The quality is good. I bought this for my daughter who is a kids size 6, it is a little bit big on her but works just the way I wanted.
B00B69EGAY|2|Too low in waist/rise.<br />Too short in legs.<br />Im only 5'5&#34;, so nit sure who these were designed for as adults.<br /><br />Fabric nice enough. Wasted on bad cut.<br />Re-train your pattern maker FOL. :(
B00CAUYBUI|5|Love the style.  I'm a medium but ordered a large.  The large fit perfect so I think it runs a little small through the shoulders.
B000Y13JS0|3|Fast delivery. Cheap fabric. Sizing is a junior , so you need to buy 1-2 sizes up. Still the sleeves are too long, and it is tight in the underarms.
B00BCUPKYI|5|These jeans fit like a glove and they are perfect for long legs.  They feel awesome in texture and I have no complaints!!!:)
B00SR7952W|3|I would like it but the waistline sits too high on me.  I love the color!
B00STX2OFE|5|Beautiful dress and a great deal ;)
B00K1IGH7Q|4|Absolutely ADORE this, especially at the price. Get lots of compliments on it and it is easily adjusted.
B00MR5NBI4|4|This one is beautiful and I'm pleased with it. I've ordered 3 for Christmas gifts. Two were fine, one I returned it was so full of threads I was afraid it might fall apart if I tired trimming them.
B0032Z7TL8|4|This was very cute for our daughter's first birthday party. After reading the reviews, I went with the 12-18 month size and was very happy with the choice because it was a perfect fit.
B004DNWNDC|4|Order a half-size up.  Regular nylons bound up my waist, even the ones that aren't control top.  Then another company came out with high-waisted girdle/nylons.  Those work great, but they cost upwards of $25 each, and sometimes I don't want to wear those girdles all day.  These are a good compromise for women who just want regular high-waisted pantyhose.  I found these nylons to be sturdy enough to wear, and even wash in the washing machine. For people who are disappointed in the colors or sizing... Go to a department store and look at all the colors and size charts in person.  You'll get a much better idea of what you are ordering.
B0019N36T4|1|Not worth the money at all it was rusty when I got and it could fit a watermelon don't get this thing
B00DEKB494|3|love the wallet its self I bought two but after having them for about two days the inside of the wallet had already ripped. Happened to both wallets.
B00FRP1F9I|5|Great fit good quality!!
B00IRJFGO6|5|The material is real soft and I think this shirt is a great conversation starter.  I might have to order another because this one will get worn a lot!
B00KU2COJ8|5|beautiful dress
B003FEEVY4|5|Great tie. Looks great when paired with a nice dress shirt and a suit vest.
B00LF3YLTC|5|love it
B004D6A01Q|5|I ordered these capris in a size too large.  The manufacturer contacted me immediately with easy instructions on how they would make it right!  The pants themselves are beautifully made.
B00D3EDPZC|5|I purchased a size up from what I normally wear as that was what people were saying and they fit perfect
B007MAMZAY|2|i want 46 and got 44. They did not loosen is the wash. So i gave them to my dad.
B00EFLM2WE|4|I love it!! It's fitted but also very comfortable. The material is very soft and feels good. I would definitely purchase other colors!!! 👍👍
B0039GY04O|2|I was really looking forward to wearing these pajamas to help deal with the problem of &#34;power surges&#34; while sleeping.  Unfortunately, for me, they didn't really work any better than a much less expensive light 100% cotton gown.
B00JVZMZF8|3|This item was ordered as an XL. My daughter who is a size 1 can well it and I couldn't even get it over my size 10 hips. Love the look though and would definately wear it if I could get my actual size.
B00FL2053E|5|My daughter wore this outfit at holloween. She is a size 4 juniors and this fits her like a glove. Excellant quality!
B00B8IAUHG|1|THis can only be handwashed i guess... my dd just wore it once and after throwing it in the machine, all the colors were faded.. not worth it.
B001PU9A9Q|5|Absolutely love these. I've been braless for almost a year now and use these for when I don't want wandering eyes landing on my nipples. They've even helped with the adjustment into my now bra-free life. With a little hand soap and water, the stickiness is restored to how it was first out of the box. Be careful - as this is a sensitive area (and as the packaging warns) when left on for too long you may begin to see a rash develop, due to lack of breathability.
B00PXOXVX6|1|Ok
B00EUEGZ1A|5|Fits well under clothes.  It fit as expected for the size they gave.  Does get a tad bit tighter when washed, unless that is the holiday goodies...  Will buy another set because wear them so often.
B00BR4ZDI2|1|Looks and fits more like a 2 extra large than a 4 extra large!
B006LXCD4G|5|Granddaughter loves the vest.  Just a great outfit. She had to put it on as soon as she got this.
B00ITNTCFO|3|OK
B002J8RRWK|5|it's super cute i love it so much, its a lot heavier than expected and the material is really nice, it's really different. Unique :). It's a great buy
B000QWA37W|5|Size a little too small in the cup for a full size 34B. From the words of my daughter, he is very comfortable, besides beige clothes fit any color.
B001JLCUU2|2|This product flattens the chest and does nothing for your belie. It  puts to much pressure on the chest. The company does not allow devolutions. I recommend don't buy this products unless you are able to try it on first.
B00K3RY6W8|3|It was a gift, she hated it. I gave it away.
B00UC95BHQ|5|Absolutely adorable. Great fit, lightweight and the colors are amazing.
B00UHG3WT8|4|I love this bathing suit! It fits really nice in both the top and bottom, although the top is a little large in the cup size! But other than that it fits perfect. High waisted and everything! The only thing I have to complain about is how long the shipping took. I got it after 2 and a half weeks of ordering it.
B00BJOER5U|3|These boxers run small. If you are goign to purchase go up one size.
B009TB1K2I|4|Great quality, beautiful color, very sturdy.<br /><br />Based on the product title, and on pictures for the one I bought (olive green) and other pics from them of the same hat but in different colors, I expected the hat to be &#34;slouchy&#34; as described. It's not. There's simply not enough height (length??) to the hat for there to be anything to slouch.<br /><br />However, it really is comfortable, and warm, and the color is gorgeous (even nicer than pictured!) so I'm definitely happy with it and wore it quite a bit this winter.
B00NM62HFK|5|This top is so cute! I love it, will wear this fall with jeans or black pants! Fits great!
B004N3BIRO|3|It was REALLY comfortable but it was a size too big.  The material is very soft.
B00CHNNB2W|5|Great warmth retention. Top notch quality.
B005IDIC54|5|Bought it for my dad, and he loved it. It was a wonderful gift.
B00ACIGM9S|1|The suggested size was way off.  If are 34 waist do not follow their suggestion of medium, get the large
