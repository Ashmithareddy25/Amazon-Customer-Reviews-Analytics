B00W8LR2DW|1|Fall off very easy when driving. The clue does not adhere well at all!!!
B00G8P3NRS|3|Didn't stick very well!
B000RXNLK6|5|the best ...... all i use
B0049E1LY2|4|Good
B001TLTELU|5|Perfect fit easy install at a great price, this is the second set like these I have bought , first set were BRP and they are exactly the same product at a much better price. They both went on Dodge Ram Crew cab one a 2010 the other a 2014 and look great and you can tell very durable. I would recommend these bars over any other and I have had others.
B00DOS0SFC|5|These are great in practically every way.  I am a huge fan of clay bar alternatives.  The sponges are a good size and density for a good grip and working in and around small areas
B00AYCLB70|5|Having extras readily available has been very handy. (These fit my 2002 Subaru WRX.)
B00UO1PFQO|5|Bought a new F150 and was a bit surprised at the lack of storage under the back seat given the amount of room. This was a great addition to the truck -- took all of 2 minutes to install. I did drill two more holes in the side of the storage unit to strap it in a bit more securely than the single strap. Works great!
B003ZWJEI4|4|Great product.
B0016VGUGU|5|Great protection for the truck bed.
B00OK5V4XS|1|Not as advertised.Would not stick to truck.Dont buy
B0002JMF98|4|did the job
B00IVLOD26|1|Does not fit CJ7 or YJs. Maybe you should add that to the description.
B00429NKWK|5|does what it's supposed to very well
B008LPEZ6Q|3|Fairly good at cleaning and smells nice. However, the product is very expensive, and the bottle that it comes in is very mediocre quality.
B00EP3PV4S|5|Easy to install and everything fix perfect.
B0041CAJ68|5|Best purchase I have made for my bagger! Since I removed the tou-pak for everyday riding I no longer had a place to put my small stuff, this fit that need...in fact I bought another one with the foam insert!
B000CIPB22|5|Real nice chrome headers !! God great with the h pipe !!
B008G4Y076|2|So okay
B00E9M472W|5|outstanding works great.
B00A1XDT40|5|This is the best deal I found online for a dozen D1 oil filters. Now I don't have to head way out to the overpriced dealership anymore, paying nearly $7 a pop! The box arrived in good condition with no damage to any of the filters.  As a side note, I previously used the D3 filters for my 22re engine for it's larger capacity. I quit doing that when I compared these side by side. This D1 filter is nearly the same exact size, maybe 3/8&#34; shorter but I can't imagine it's enough to make any noticeable difference, so I'm sticking with what the engineers recommend. I imagine they understand oil filter specification better than we do.
B00YI21JTC|5|Great product,fits perfect and install was fast.
B0002JMTAI|5|husband very pleased with purchase.
B00A4542H8|5|Great stuff will always use it from now on
B008ESZAKK|5|PERFECT!
B0014H7LUA|5|Had to make my own slits so the head rest can go thru the top but a SUPER buy!!!
B005OZNZD0|2|Works for the door however nobody would program it.  Ended up buying an $80 key from hardware store.
B002LQ7IGA|5|easy for installation.
B006CRT72W|4|Great little Fob programs easy
B0009H51LC|5|perfect and fits jeep xj 98
B006GJK8MY|5|These shipped fast, and were exactly what we needed.  My husband loved them so much he ordered another set.  Good quality and great price.
B00ELQ6GFC|5|Great product, fits well
B003CKJDW6|4|does its job
B00KTJ807W|2|Worked for the 1st week and the now only the panic button works and all the others don't.
B011B25IXY|5|Just tryed the microfiber wash mitt and I find it to be good , strong , right size and lint free .
B000C2YWS2|3|Looks cheap. Makes a whining noise when the engine is running (you can't hear it from the cabin)
B00557P8JQ|2|When I ordered my Ac Delco O/E Air shocks it was stated that I needed this kit for installation, which I DID NOT need so now I have to pay return shipping
B0014DGULA|4|I have had this meter for twenty plus years of monthly use.  I replace the batteries about every three years. This is by far the best deal on these batteries I have found.
B0017OANWI|5|Good
B009DKIQWM|5|Awesome graphic!  I purchased and installed this product over a year ago and it still looks great! It fit perfectly on my Toyota Land Cruiser Prado back window. You can see out from inside just fine day or night but it blocks the light coming in and you cant see in from outside very well.<br /><br />Because I use an automatic car wash often, I was concerned the rotating wash brushes would begin to peel the edges of the graphic off the window so I coated the edges (1/16th of an inch) with some glue (which hopefully will scrape off the glass).
B00XPL88NC|5|i was looking for a tire gauge that was easy to attach to a motorcycle tire with large rotors...this one does the trick and is easy to read and easy to adjust tire pressure...i like it!
B007OX6E3S|5|It works. It's small and you can keep it in your bag to pump your presta valves at a gas station, and there are 2 of them!
B00CD6FL6M|5|What is there to say? These things work and are made well.
B001B5EEEQ|5|Yes thanks
B00EP3PUV2|1|The brackets did not bolt up to exsiting holes on my 2015 Dodge 1500 crew cab like ad described.
B001HBMYDW|5|Worked wonderful.
B0037WD76C|5|Ok so let me start out by saying this is not for the faint of heart.  This project took forever.  Everyone is saying that it took people not long at all for the 2nd one.  That is true.  So everything must be removed from the rear of the car.  All of the trim pieces on both sides of the car must be removed.  The 6 bolts holding down the rear seat (my wife has the 3rd row).  in order to get the side panels off, the 3rd row seats had to be removed and the seat belt bottom bolts had to get removed as well.  That being said the project did not take that long once I was able to get to the bolts under the trim pieces.  If she did not have a 3rd row it might have been much easier.  I have attached pictures for those that don't believe.  Mind you I do most maintenance on all my cars this one was fun!!!<br /><br />Lastly, I just found these on Amazon (THEY HAVE EVERYTHING!!!!).  That being said these were 50 bucks cheaper than AutoZone.  However with AutoZone they were lifetime warranty.  My wife drives in downtown Atlanta through all the potholes and I guess I ended up buying a warranty with the extra 100 bucks.
B001IYFJJY|5|good price  fast delivery
B003S1RQ2S|5|This will work in your Fios box and it about 1/4 the price that Verizon will charge. Its easy to install. Its a battery, not much more to say...
B002IC1UA2|5|Everything I needed for a complete refresh of my 98 Civic.  I was able to give my son a car that had every part that suffers normal wear replaced.  Excellent product!
B006T7AS6Y|5|Quite attractive. Makes for a lovely gift.
B0036VQUOA|5|I was very skeptical about using this on a new (and by new, I mean a 2003 that my family just bought) Porsche. Someone had opened their door into my door and left a nice scratch on it. Long story short, I'm freaking out so I call the cops while the person's car is still there and they say there isn't much they can do.<br /><br />Some googling turned me to this product. I tried things like Nu Scratch Doctor and that didn't do it. I wasn't prepared to wet sand a nice pristine condition paint job but I decided it was best to try to remove the scratch. After following the written instructions VERY carefully, everything ended up working out great! At first it looked as though my scratch was into the metal, because the clear coat pen didn't fill it in as well, but after doing the sanding and polishing, it looked just fine!<br /><br />It's VERY important to rub the paint polish on multiple times when you get to that step. It really makes a difference when you do it a few times.<br /><br />There will be a sort of glare however on the car where you were sanding. I was lucky that I made the width of my work area about a half of an inch. I apply A nice carnauba wax and buffed it out and it appears to have diminished the glare from the work area. I'll have to check in better daylight tomorrow.<br /><br />Overall though, it's way better than what it was before! It's making me want to start going through and fixing every chip on the car!
B00CXYVKKA|5|This item was a gift for a dinosaur lover! She loved it!
B008DEY87Q|4|Fit well. Had to modify for mounting on drivers side. Had to drill a hole in well to mount.
B00BQ257FY|4|really like this was not disappointed and it has a nice long chain that is included.
B0049Z76OU|5|I had replaced the bulbs in my 2003 bonneville which has 3 that are soldered in and you pretty much have to get them from a supplier of radio parts and the good ones aren't cheap. I was surprised when I took the radio out of my 2000 Trans Am and saw that it had 1 of these bulbs. The description said that it doesn't fit my car but I read a couple of the reviews that said it wasn't supposed to fit they're cars either and it looked just like mine so I took a chance and ordered a couple. It was identical to my old one and the price was about 1/4 of that of the GM dealer (I had to give them the part # that Amazon had listed). Worked perfectly. I would like to say though some of the reviewers said all they had to do was twist the bulb and it came right out so replacing it was super easy, that was not the case with mine it was soldered in to the printed circuit top and bottom but it is totally doable with a soldering iron and a little patience. I didn't solder it back in.
B0035UAAUM|5|GOOD FIT TO MY SUZUKI SADDLE BAGS. GOOD QUALITY TOO.
B000143LHY|5|I knew from &quot;My 70s Experience&quot; that this would handle any odor I could throw at it. Smoking, cooking odors, bathroom odors all go away quickly after what I would call a heavy soap smell goes away. One quick half second spray, wait 30 seconds and everything's fresh again.
B000TG6LF8|5|SENT QUICKLY WITH OTHER ORDER.IM SURE IT WILL WORK FINE.
B00XPDZQB2|1|Looks awesome the reverse bulb size is 3156 fit could be better but they dont have any huge gaps or anything they perform flawlessly without a no load flasher update: dropped to one star after one year one of tail lights having 3 leds go out and after two years the left tail light completely shorted internally blowing both my turn signal and my brake light fuse another con is there only warrantied for 90 days
B00KVVBEWQ|1|UPDATE October 4, 2015 - after less than two weeks of daily use the GPS had an electrical issue, overheated, and would not work.<br /><br />I am pretty impressed with the Magellan RV9490T-LMB. It can handle finding the information for your RV, no matter what size. From Class C up to Class A Semi Tractor and Trailer. There seem to be no limitations on size so it should be able to andle anything out there.<br /><br />The features work great! It has the next move, and move after that viewable on the screen. It shows the speed limit for the road and the highway milemarker. If there are any accidents or delays up ahead it will let you know. You can customize the map with showing features such as gas stations, grocery stores, etc. If there are locations you use often, you can store them in the GPS. The Walmart one touch button is useful. The cradle for the GPS is strong. At full extension it has handled bumps, nudges and the weight of the GPS. It comes with a car adapter, usb cord and an ac adapter.<br /><br />On the flip side, it took the GPS about 30-40 minutes and a few restarts to find its location the first time. After that it boots up quickly. It took awhile to attach the car adapter to the cradle, You push it in until it clicks, but you have to finess it to make it fit. The battery life on mine is maybe 5 minutes. It is usable only connected to power. Though there is a one touch Walmart search button, you cannot create a search one touch button. For example if I want to know here all Safeways are and the distance from me, I can't do that. I have to Pick a certain location. This limits the usefulness of the one touch button for me,<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this GPS. The direcctions and features are great and the annoyances aren't anything I can't live with.
B000ICYC4U|5|This stuff is fantastic. It polished 10 year old metal and made it look brand new again. I also used it to polish my Fenix E01 flashlight front reflector and it made it throw light better. I use this stuff all the time and I'm sure I'll buy more when I run out. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.
B00UL3EGA6|1|The LOOKED good in the photos, they SAY they fit Dodge Intrepids, the even LOOK like they are good quality out of the box, BUT they are worthless.<br /><br />The only Pros I can say is that they are certainly strong and will lift the trunk. Just one of these is enough to lift the trunk up, but...<br /><br />...they have no finesse.<br /><br />A proper lift support should slow the trunk lid down as it opens so that it gently reaches the end of its travel. Not these, they open at high speed and don't slow down at all, so the lid slammed into the fully open position so hard it bounced of the end of its travel before coming to a stop.<br /><br />Then there's the fitment. For starters they connecters are different than OEM. Although they are still designed to fit the ball mounts, they fit very loosely, especially the bottom one. I was able to pull them off the mounts with the locking clips on, without much effort.<br /><br />But that's not even the worst part, oh no. While side by side they looked close in length to the originals, once on and the trunk was closed I noticed that they were forcing the lid to look like it was popped open at the corners. When I took them off I realized that they had also been rubbing on the surface of the trunk itself, so now there's paint chipped off from where they were rubbing.<br /><br />These are garbage and should be avoided at all costs.
B00495UQT2|5|Great new look in the engine compartment. Incredibly easy to install.
B00C5RB03W|5|Works Great
B00T68UKBQ|5|No more hood prop bar. I used the instructions and did not have any issues installing these on my Tacoma. I will buy these for every vehicle i purchase that use the stupid Hood prop bar.
B0031HEIDY|5|Just wanted to post some specs.  Excellent Bulbs overall.
B000KKENBM|5|Still holding on to my spare.  It be better if it came with a way to secure/lock the spare.
B00HU6N3LK|4|I ordered this product a couple weeks ago after reading what seemed like hundreds of reviews - both good and bad. I decided to order both the Leather Honey cleaner and conditioner mainly because of the large amount of positive reviews. Now its my turn to review the products.<br /><br />First off, both products arrived over a week before the estimated delivery time. Good job Amazon! Looking at both bottles, they are a simplistic design - almost antique looking, not showy but not bland, i actually quite like the look myself. The instructions are fairly basic, but easy to follow and make perfect sense.<br /><br />Leather Honey cleaner:<br />I bought the 8oz bottle which comes concentrated, so i used a spray bottle and filled it with the recommend amount of water and Leather Honey Cleaner written on the back of the bottle, shook it up and it was ready to go. The bottle states that you put 2 tablespoons of cleaner to one cup of water, i found that i needed to put 3 tablespoons of cleaner to a cup of water because i couldn't get the cleaner to actually get in the leather and lift the dirt and grim - not until i put in the 3rd tablespoon. I used a brush to clean my leather car seats just because the brush can help get into the leather easier and bring up the dirt and grime. You will need to use a fair bit of elbow-grease for the product to work, but it does work. My leather is 24 years old - not ripping/tearing or anything, but is old, and the cleaner was nice and gentle on the leather, no harsh chemicals are used in the cleaner (as far as i am aware.) But the product does work.<br /><br />Leather Honey Conditioner:<br />Now the conditioner. As the name suggest, it is thick like honey, almost unpleasantly thick. Many people said you don't need to use gloves when applying the conditioner, but i would recommend using them as the conditioner is thick, it leaves a thin layer over your hands. When washing your hands it takes longer than it should as it is almost like cleaning oil or butter off of your hands, takes a while as the conditioner seems to repel the water. I used a rag to apply the conditioner as it was easier rather than a brush. The conditioner goes on pretty tough, so you will need to use some elbow-grease to spread it evenly over the leather. Some of the lower starred reviews, they stated that light coloured leather (like mine - cream colour) gets stained a darker colour than the original colour, and the company is aware of this too as they state on the back that some leathers may change colour, but over time will return back to the original colour. I didnt have this problem, so i'm not sure about the colour changing. The bottle also states that you leave the conditioner on the seats over night and wipe off the excess the next day, so thats what i did. The excess does wipe of, but it is tough because of the thick consistency. I found that it didn't leave a sticky feel, and it also leaves a nice shine. I sort of have a love/hate thought on this product because, yes it does condition the seats (made mine nice and soft and almost brought the life back to them) but it is thick and hard to evenly spread across the leather.<br /><br />Final opinion:<br />The leather cleaner is a non harsh chemical product that helps to clean seats, and yes it does clean the seats, but you have to use some elbow grease, and i found i needed to add more concentrated cleaner per cup of water to have the product have some more effect to the leather. Like i said earlier, my car seats are 24 years old, and being sitting in the Australian sun its whole life, they were very dry, so the cleaner helped clean and bring moisture back to the seats. The conditioner, would i use it again, yes, but would i use it on a ferrari... probably not. The thick, almost unpleasant consistency makes it difficult to spread evenly over the seats, but it also does its job, conditions and brings life back to the seats, and thats what a leather conditioner is meant to do.il or butter off of your hands, takes a while as the conditioner seems to repel the water.

B000C57VCS|5|This part fit our truck perfectly. The instructions were included, and it was easy to install. This part seems very durable and Moog has a great reputation for its parts. I would highly recommend this product.
B004AGCFW6|5|Excellent. Fit my 2010 Chrysler 5.7 hemi awd perfectly.
B008WTO0G6|5|love it
B004ABPFZK|5|Installed in 05 XT Forester Sport...firms up shifts,and keeps interior resonance down to a minimum!<br />You WILL have to remove the TMIC to install it.
B004KK553I|5|so sparkly. have had over a year and all rhinestones are still intact! :)
B001IA8FMG|5|big improvement after I installed them I put almost a 1000 lbs in it and it didn't drop. before it would have sagged quite a bit.
B00RVE1M3C|2|Didn't adhere to car window it ripped while trying to put on window...........
B00F8LEB9W|5|Arrived on time, work perfectly couldn't be happier with purchase.
B0017ODUKK|5|exactly as represented and hoped for
B003ELWCBC|4|Works ok
B00MQZ2P3M|5|very nice
B002UJVNFA|4|I`d recommend these... comfortable fit well and you get the variety of shades you need when riding with an open face helmet.
B000RFUF12|4|Exactly what I expected.  Could not find one locally.
B00N2ZFTOW|5|Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised.
B00JS9WTEE|5|PERFECT, FAST DELIVERY
B00B1FD3BQ|5|Wow my driving experience is much more enjoyable in Atlanta traffic in my 2013 Durango R/T.  This appears to fill out the power band much better when you are between 1-2k RPMs.  It would bog down and then down shift two gears and the vehicle would take off. The acceleration is smooth and crisp.  Installation was easy and instructions were easy to follow.  Route the cables as the instructions say and connect them before securing with zip ties.  I'll update this review after I have a chance to tow my RV.  NOTE:  This product was sold by Amazon LLC as &#34;NEW&#34; but it was clearly installed before. The installation CD was scratched and missing the CD case. It only came with 1 zip tie and the box was beaten up.  However, it was $40 cheaper than all other vendors.  Not complaining on what I purchased, it is going into the engine anyway, but if you sell as NEW than it shouldn't have been installed before.
B00H6XPZN6|4|Perfect way to protect the little ones from the sun
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great spot lights. I have them mounted below my rear bumper and they are perfect back up lights. I can now see to back up in pitch dark, especially off road where you need to see more than just a foot behind the vehicle!
B012GW8QAA|5|My son will start driving soon and these are perfect for learners permit practice! Just slap them on the back and you're ready to go and fellow drivers are more understanding once they see the magnets.
B00ZV0X46G|5|Very PROUD that the sticker PROUDLY made in USA !
B009B9HWEI|5|It drops the temp a lot and is easy to use.
B000KITSMI|5|My husband was excited when this arrived. He is very pleased
B002696FA2|5|Did the trick as advertised.
B002R4NJW8|5|Good product
B001O0A668|1|Did not not fit 2004 Ram w/20&#34; wheels and diameter of seat much smaller than factory.
B0041TJPXY|5|Bought this to replace the leaking condenser in my 10 chev equinox.  The original condenser leaks after 5 years, so i plan to get an aftermarket part to try.  Easy to replace, just get the front bumper off and you have enough space between impact bar and radiator.  No need to take the impact bar off.  Easy to change.  May need a wrench to adjust the angle of the mounting hole to better fit.  Now the AC is ice cool.  So far so good.  Will come back to update if anything happen.  Hope it can last longer (&#62;5 years) than the original one.
B00144965Q|5|Works fine, received it promptly.
B0049MFPFA|5|Comes in a oversized box, it's already filled with fluid and ready to go. Installation on my Jeep Wrangler 1998 Sport 4.0 was very easy.<br />Lift the hood all the way until it rests on the windshield. The hardest part is to remove and install the Master Cylinder, because the two bolts are extremely long and it's a hard to reach area. You will need a long socket attached to a U-joint connector and few extensions.<br />Clutch started working after a few pumps and it has been working perfectly since then. I would recommend this product.<br />Note that the second picture shows a wire connector that is not included, but I didn't need it anyway. I use the existing one, just slide a plastic locking mechanism to remove it from the old master cylinder ram.
B00IZG63DE|5|This is a quality unit but I ended up returning it because it was too large to fit on the rear rail of my trailer. As a note, this unit is 5.5 inches in diameter, even though the packaging says that it's a 4 inch. It's the red portion portion of the lens that is four inches in diameter. The housing is about 3/4&#34; thick.
B00C7I5PS0|3|Good for the money but the will fall apart from cheap glue
B006K8VIAM|2|What I received is not what is pictured I wanted a plastic tub with a screw on lid . Not a cardboard container with a press on lid
B00AEO0CV4|5|Easy to install. No tools! Seem rugged and durable enough. These went on a MINI Cooper and I read up quite a bit before I purchased to make sure they would work. With low ground clearance, they can and will tear off. This is good though. Great compliment with a good floor jack. Tire rotations a breeze as a good jack quickly lifts both tires off the ground at the same time. Inexpensive and easy to replace.
B00AB3HC98|5|Subaru literally took the exact dimensions of a 2015 WRX windshield and replicated it in the form of a foldable sun shade. The sun shade appears very durable with high quality materials and construction. An apparent disadvantage is the larger size, making storage a bit more difficult.
B00G6FDT7E|5|Worked but I didn't need it. Consider changing the blower motor first.
B000C9O7R6|5|Awesome, great quality for the price. the grease fitting is why i bought these and it works great. be ready for some work to remove the old joints, ended up taking my axle to ford and they did it for a few bucks. but ended up saving $400 bucks doing it myself.
B00O7KJ4JW|1|Do not buy this product. The toe peg on the gear shifting pedal become loose and fell off on the highway. The seller would not replace it, even if you are willing to pay for the replacement. Almost caused me to wreck on the road due to I was in a high gear approaching traffic and had no way of downshifting.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Huge...worked great!
B000C36BIU|5|Works great. No more squeeling. Will buy again.
B00OH2O3WI|5|Used for a regular trash can to make it recycle can. Worked out well.
B005P53T9Y|1|First month already falling apart.
B00IQFDCEC|5|Great price with quality within. Easy to install and ride good
B000GKJK3W|5|Fantastic. Nice 4&#34; casters for working on 4x4 s make it really easy to get up and down with my bad back. I'm 200 lbs + and it easily supports me
B00SVYKC64|5|I have always installed Husky Liners in my new trucks and have never been disappointed. This fits great in the back of my new F150. Be careful about reading the instructions -- says to trim the insert... but only if you have a BENCH seat. Don't cut with bucket seats! I tested it and 1 quart of water doesn't overflow...
B00FDQPCR2|4|So far my still working stall it during cold winter -25 degree and spring and summer 2014 to 2015. Bright. Run about 2 hrs if turn on. It be nice product if it had dusk to dawn dim light.
B00CO85HBI|4|The pieces are all cut with a very clean edge, no rough corners or jagged edges on any of the pieces in my kit. Overall the pieces fit pretty well, and installation was a no brainer. I wish the small pieces for the rear of the cab were a about half an inch wider to cover more of the body panel, but that's my personal preference. The only issues I had were with the rear quarter panels that fit between the wheels and the bumper. These needed a lot of carefull placement, and some serious pressure to warp them slightly to fit all the curves of the body panel. But overall the kit works well, I prepped the panels and blasted them with black plasti dip, the finished product looks great and I would definitely buy them again for another vehicle. I would have given 5 stars, but the rear panels needed some tweaking in order to sit correctly.
B00IEYDZTC|5|Perfect
B00H6XPZN6|4|Item exactly as shown.  The suction cups were hard to stick because they did not lie flat in the packaging, so I'm having to flatten them out before I can use them. Other than that, works like a charm.
B00COYNY1W|5|I bought two, as both my daughters are part of the Phoenix Branch of the Mandalorian Mercs, and they Loved the Keychains. Had to show them off to the group, and I am sure you have probably sold out. Thank you for making my girls see me again as the &#34;Cool Mom&#34;, and by the way, my girls are 28, so never too late to do something neat for your kids.
B00XZ9MYRA|5|The item was shipped very quickly after purchase and arrived earlier than estimated. It was exactly as advertised. The programming instructions were clear and simple. This company is highly recommended.
B00GOW6VAQ|5|Easy to assemble
B002DYZ2FE|5|Great Product
B007LICJ0S|5|Looks good on my ride.
B005VWR4TW|5|THIS ONE!!<br /><br />I've replaced this part on our 2001 Toyota Sequoia I don't know how many times.  6? 7?  I finally found the one that is made out of quality material and replaced it.  By the way - I recommend replacing the whole kit - the cable and all (made a huge difference) - we finally have a decent working rear hitch-gate, and this is the quality part you've been shopping for.  Trust me, I've bought the rest of them and was disappointed each time!
B00ZGIEAAM|3|This replacement light assembly was not a great fit on my 2000 Sienna.  From a performance perspective and from 20-feet, it's ok.
B00WT68KB4|1|Junk. Do not buy this starter. Spend a little extra and buy elsewhere. Trust me, I wosh I did. It's gets hot on its on. Do not buy, wish I knew. No instructions or specs come with it either.
B00K007R6U|5|Has always been the best.<br /><br />I managed to be distracted while cooking hamburgers and my entire condo unit filled with smoke. I could barely see. Neighbors came knocking on my door about smoke in the hallways :-)<br /><br />Was very concerned of getting rid of any imbedded smoke smell which can be very difficult to get rid of. Of course opened all the windows and used a whole house circular.<br /><br />Ordered two boxes and set them out and there is absolutely no smoke odor in my unit<br /><br />Ozium neutralizes rather than masks odors.
B000A8QLUA|5|Best set of spark plugs I have ever used. They last long too
B0007WQN1G|5|This has to be the best truck bed cover you can buy. It is easy to install without tools. I can remove it completely when I need to haul bigger items. I had the same cover on my previous Ford F-150 for 10 years without issue. I am certain this one will last as long as I have my new F-150.
B00FFAT9K2|5|Just as described
B00MXZYU7O|5|It took 5 minutes to replace and works great!! Tractor kept shutting down when hot then would not start at all. This is an exact replacement. Saved from the dealer!
B005C85HLC|5|Absolutely love it! Fit perfect and already wore it on a 30 hour ride and love love love it!
B002INTDSM|5|I've only used this once, but it worked well and seems none the worse for wear.
B00EYF668M|5|Perfect fit at an awesome price
B00B2A059S|5|fit like a glove and half of dealer price,very satisfied
B00HW2H6UQ|5|Makes car look a lot better!!
B00UILP2PE|5|Not trying to buy anything fancy but this works well with my black car and I don't have to have any type of metal touching the paint. You can't even tell the difference from a far! Great buy for the price! 👌🏼
B00116SGVM|1|So, after 2 years of owning this tire plug kit I finally had the opportunity to use it a couple weekends ago. When attempting to insert the plug into a small trailer tire the needle split in half. I was NOT impressed. Luckily, I had a spare tire. SO, the moral of the story is you get what you pay for. I just received my new Black Jack tire plug kit. We have one at my shop where it gets used all the time on semi truck tires. I am very impressed with it.
B00ZJ6TOZC|5|Awesome product and even better customer support!!
B00JEXODM0|4|Awesome light bar! 7 flash modes, very bright, gets the traffic's attention. Only bad thing is the length of the cord. Way to short. Was installed in rear window of rescue truck.
B00KTJ1VNM|1|truck would not except this key. cost me $160.00 at the dealer to buy their key
B009YR00MI|3|Bulkier than it looks. It works well.
B003STZ5RS|5|Good enough
B00MQ1DHLU|5|Took 2 minutes to install.  Fit perfectly.  A fast easy repair.
B00FEYHE4M|5|perfect
B00SF8ESDO|5|Great product, fast delivery.  Product was just as described.
B00822YRPM|5|My car is lady bugged out. Next purchase will be lady bug floor mats. For my black 2013 ford focus st. Getting so many compliments on these items and how they look.
B00K890RBU|5|Very pleased with this purchase and for the prompt service.
B000MK27RC|2|The product is fine. I choose to give it two stars because it is one of those products that my wife buys for every vehicle and never uses. It gets tossed in the back for a while and then finds its way into my garage.
B00LV18KWM|5|Extremely solid product, much heavier than expected.  I wasn't able to use it as intended because my drop hitch has a 45-degree brace connecting the horizontal and vertical shanks of the hitch, and this brace prevents the device from sliding fully onto the shank, It fit my standard ball mount very well and was quick and easy to tighten, as well as remove.  A few reviews have stated the set screws were too short to reach the shank effectively; I didn't experience this with my particular mounts.  It fit very well and I didn't have to tighten the set screws much to get them to grab.  Based on build quality alone, I would buy another of these.
B004ZIUIWS|5|I bought one for my husband at Christmas and he loves it! He loves it so much I had to buy one for myself because he won't share! Great product but I do wish it could be either washed or dry-cleaned .
B003YKXTSI|4|A little heavy, but quite useful. I have found that I needed this on more occasions than I expected, and it has been quite nice to have a few tools available to me in a pinch! The light on the end is an especially nice feature, as you can hold the button for the light as you use the tools and better illuminate what you're working on.
B0000AY0G6|5|Very heavy duty. Easy install
B00S9U0IF0|5|Got here a day early, breaths well and functions as advertised.
B006OF55L4|4|Looks very cute on my jeep. Good size!
B009EU5ZMA|5|Works splendidly!
B000EDUUIA|5|Easy instructions. Its down and works perfectly. Great idea !
B00HETCE5O|5|Good finish work exelente for a fan control unit
B009NRBBD6|5|It was exactly what I needed.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I have a large windshield and this sun protector is large enough to cover the entire area very well.  It is lightweight and folds easily to put away.
B00VK0ATNC|5|Confused when the lights arrived, all clear, I contacted Partsam and was advised it's the LED's that illuminate in color, test each one to discover which is what color. I did this and indeed I had what I had ordered. I suggested Partsam advise purchasers that the lenses are clear for all colors, it's the LED that makes the color, and I suggested also they mark the individual lights with what color they are because the buyer MUST test-light each one to determine color for him/herself. Beyond that the lights are terrific!  Easy to install, very bright.
B0068G04NI|5|Well made, fits my '13 N1K perfectly. Much better wind protection than OEM and no buffeting. I'm 5'11&#34; and at low setting wind hits right at eye level.
B001FCB4JS|3|This product is soft putty in a roll with paper backing. I ordered three rolls. One of the three roles had a deep square indentation midway in the center of the roll on one side. The indent was so deep that it distorted the putty and caused a break in the putty. It caused about 2&#34; of wasted putty every foot as I unspooled it and a gap in the seal of the putty where I had to start and stop each time. Very unhappy that vendor put a damage roll in the box for me. If I was at a store buying this stuff, I would have put that role back unless it was discounted.
B00230D6KQ|4|Even though a universal design, I was able to easily install on my drz400e.
B001JT1CEE|5|Well, wire's wire so I can't say much about this. It's very convenient to wire my Wolo horn with because the two leads are attached as one and keep it neat and safe.
B000WJFWSY|4|not up to all the hype. sticky
B0075ON740|4|Met expectations.
B0002I94DE|4|Great for what I used them for but could be a bit pricy
B00Y5I54K4|1|Worst thing ever bought won't stick to my door and that it doesn't stick to textured surface is dumm
B007QBNIWS|4|works as a master cylinder should.....thought it would be a made in usa but wasn't-still works well.
B00753S8CC|5|Perfect
B00U7U376W|5|Work great.
B00YBIE2GK|1|This product does not fit the 2010 Subaru Impreza WRX as stated. When I contacted the company to let them know that I was dissatisfied with the product, they informed me that &#34;I should not expect it to fit like the manufacturer product&#34;. I told them I wanted to return it for this reason and was charged a 15% re-stocking fee! The product is SUB PAR and the company does not stand behind it. Don't waste your money on the novelty because you will be disappointed with the product. I went with a knob made by COBB Tuning & it fits perfectly.
B000BW8LSU|5|right part good price
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great! Easy to deploy and repack.Makes a huge difference.
B00APE6WDA|1|This did not even come close to matching my car.  It looks like I have a super dark red spot on my hood now.  Save the time and money and just take your car in to be touched up.
B000IZ12CC|4|Installed it seems to work like it should thanks Amazon
B004CSEJ76|5|Love them
B00199HTV4|5|Great box, could have been a tad bit longer. But very pleased with it. Delivery was so fast it made my head spin.....
B007TQJTFK|5|Works very well and installed in about 15 minutes.
B000C9MNRM|5|wonderful
B001RB9W6Y|4|It came on time and I like it
B000CQOIT6|5|What can i say, its a trailor hitch...
B00LA9B4R8|5|Great Deal!!
B002VGAYAC|5|Having a hotter Summer than usual,my Daughter could not transport her young child w/o her automobile AC running properly.I ordered the fan& had it delivered to her home& it arrived in record time.Word to the wise installing this! There tends to be very tight quarters for installing this under the hood so you may have to remove the core support to avoid damaging the radiator.Its been in for about 5 days & working fine! Price was very reasonable to.
B00ONDM07G|5|One of those things you'll wonder how you lived without. Sturdy and well designed, i enables you to lace an iPhone 6, GoPro or GPS in line of sight. It even has a little chord holder for your charger wire. Attaches easily with the existing screw that is below the existing tray (who knew?). You have to wonder why MoPar doesn't at least offer it as an option.
B000C800AK|1|Was not the one pictured also did'not work
B00C30H9UE|5|Perfect. Fits like a glove. Exactly what I was looking for.
B006N98O1E|3|This is ok. I was hoping(like the photo shows) that there is an allen wrench on the end, but it doesn't exist. so you have to use a very skinny wrench to hold the bold while you tighten it. Being very careful otherwise you'll tear the rubber boot.  Some models from different brand has the bolt end with an allen wrench hole so it's better to hold while tightening down ( LIKE IT SHOWS On the photo) they must have changed manufacturers.Also The one i got has a plastic bulb on the back end.
B000779SUO|5|Exactly as expected.
B000A0EJAW|5|Fast delivery was as described
B000X3EUTQ|5|Cool
B00I90IWOY|5|Fits perfect
B00FHSXLYC|4|The shifter emblem is not straight. Other then that fits well.
B001NYWVWC|5|Perfect fit.  Took care of the rattle.
B001GGFAWA|5|WIFE LOVED IT
B0007RS4CW|3|Smells great! Product is apparently meant be sprayed directly on to car carpet/fabric and the scent only lasts a day or two.  I tried putting it into a receptacle (small open faced can under the car seat) in order to keep the scent for a few days or longer. In the summer heat, this product is not strong enough to work like that but it does work well if used as intended (directly spraying onto carpet).
B000R81VMG|5|It works fine
B00C1N1XJ6|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B005O1A13G|5|Pretty much what I expected. Delivered on time, at a reasonable price. Can't ask for much more...
B001OKD8VI|5|Nice fit, nicely packaged.  Thanks for a great product.
B000AMLWH8|4|great product, a little difficult to follow the instruction
B0002SR7TM|5|Excellent product super easy to adjust with disc best I have used  ASE master tech
B000C2OAUC|2|will not reach full speed
B0047RKS72|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B001OMRD1M|5|Works great....
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I purchased the X-Shade Car Sunshade Jumbo for my 1998 Land Cruiser and it fits perfectly.  The summer in Seattle has been in the 90's and the product keeps the interior much cooler than without it.  It's simple to fold away in the storage pouch with a twist and a fold.  5-Stars!!
B00WXBYYR4|4|Worked great
B00GGQMI5M|4|Arrived on time, easy to install
B000GRXI6A|5|Faster and good
B000LUBQ4I|4|quality product
B000ZAUOGK|1|Not a bench seat cover that I ordered or is pictured. I double checked that I selected bench but received bucket seat covers. Useless
B00X6DE35Q|5|Love this shade for my PT looks like I am in a island and the small ones are great for coving my mom from the sun
B00ELHNIJI|5|Great oil at a great price.
B00T3WRRYI|4|Tidy!  Very happy.
B007NPSCDW|5|Excellent mats, already went through rain and love them.  Great detail for your Jeep.  Update:   They have survived rain and snow and no issues at all.  No need to spend hundreds of dollars in weather tech mats.  These one do the job for less than half the price.
B00496RE82|5|I purchased this electric fuel pump to remove fuel from my boats fuel tank.  Worked like a champ.  Just make sure all your connections are air and fluid tight.  I had a hose clamp that was sucking air and it took me about 10 minutes to realize that this pump wasnt a piece of s*** and that I was a moron that did not check my connections.  I had also had many beers.  Doesnt matter, pumped worked.  I wish everything I dealt with worked as was expected.
B007J310IW|5|Received quickly.  Looks great
B00KTHZ8CY|5|worked great went to lexus of austin for 12.00 they cut the key blank and gave me a cappuccino key cost 18.00 not 175.00
B00YBBK9OG|4|Pretty cool gift only problem I see is how to change the battery when it goes out
B002EB6BHY|5|Good quality
B0113AKEZQ|5|Looks really cool and I've got a few comments (and laughs)
B00K5527EW|3|They wasn't too bad it did all my bad lights and front indictors
B000C45NHY|2|Bought at autozone lower mounting tab was almost broke off. Pulled cover to repair mount and saw the shoody workmanship inside. Installed to see if it worked and it has a terriable stutter when you try to pass. Sending it back, maybee I will upgrade when I get the next one.
B0012UK3M2|5|Arrive on time, bright light with good price .
B00OSWU9CU|5|Fit was perfect and I have had several of these and I really like that I can clean and replace instead of buying new each time.
B0046NR2RQ|4|It's a grommet. It did what it does...
B00FMV0WFA|5|perfect fit and works great.
B00Q8CVLW0|5|Change it 2 days ago working good.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Soft enough and easy to clean!
B00TTLR8VK|5|great price showed up fast.
B002XM5G70|5|works well
B00ET8JQZE|5|great price showed up fast.
B000E2CVIS|5|Good deal...
B00I8NW6MQ|5|AAAAAAA+++++
B0131EYDP4|5|The toughest thing about the install is removing the tow hooks.  On my Lariat, they had plastic guards around them so you need a 15 mm ratcheting closed end wrench to remove the bolts.  The front one has to come all the way out.  Only loosen the rear bolts or you may loose the bracket inside the bumper they screw into.  Some people worry about installing this on a truck EcoBoost engine but the skid plate is well ventilated and removable, if you want to error on the side of caution.
B00DIKCM6E|5|Worked flawlessly.
B00E0FRZEK|2|This sizing is incorrect. I purchased a 2XL and I am an adult, this would be a 2xl for a child. Granted I do have a belly. I weigh 245 and am 5'11&#34; tall. I could not even come close to zipping. What a disappointment that I have to return it. Arm length was good, this must be for a slim body
B00MTK21VU|5|Very good!! All LEDs work, and the material is quite good.
B00VAIDWDS|3|Way too tight.too short for my car that was listed for that size.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love this shade. Flexible so it covers all the nooks and crannies. Highly recommend this product.&#34;
B001EAQTRI|5|I received the item on time and it was well packaged.  It's fantastic.  Easy to plug in and it just works.  No more static if I want to charge my phone and listen to music at the same time.
B00APN8V44|5|worked great  very happy with product
B006QPMCMW|4|works great
B000C5YCYS|5|Exact part for half the price....
B000CF8VUE|1|First I had to trim the front shades where they go behind the mirror, which wouldn't have been a big deal if they worked as advertised.  However, now when I roll the window down then roll it back up, it hits the shade at the bottom by the mirror because the double sided tape doesn't hold the shade against the mirror.  It sounds like the window is going to break as it goes up.
B005MZZ5Z8|5|It was a great experience.
B0033QO022|5|I run this in a 4 stroke. Works fine in 100+ Texas heat.
B00VUQXCQC|5|5 mins to install, came with everything needed, except for hand tools.<br />Fits 2015 Vw Passat SE TDI Models.
B00EE3FDO2|5|Fit right up to my dodge, and looks great.
B008G4Y076|5|Bright as H** I love it 8-19-15
B008PJDOSS|5|Fit perfect
B0049KX6VW|5|Great product...Great price!!!
B0024ECCJW|5|Hooked it up in my Travel Trailer in about an hour.  Heated water in about 2 hours.  Run the gas heat and this electric heater and you won't run out of hot water.  Love this thing.
B010R7CF8A|4|Product seems to meet the standard in which was stated about product!
B00NSDSHI8|5|It was everything I expected. Could not be happier.
B000A8JNF0|5|I used this on Sunday and Tuesday we had a storm with strong wind and rain and let me tell you the water just beads off like it isn't even fabric! I plan on buying this for the duration of owning this car!!! It is super easy to use. I will add one helpful tip. Buy a pre-taped drop cloth, the ones that you use when painting to cover your baseboards, and tape all around the top so that none (or very little) of the product gets on your paint/glass. I did that and honestly that took longer than then application.<br /><br />Here is how I applied it:<br />-I washed my car and cleaned the top with the included cleaner (takes forever to rinse out)<br />-Then I waxed my car, took off the wax, then sat the car in the sun to fully dry the top<br />-Then taped all around the top with the tape/drop cloth<br />-Sprayed the Fabric Guard all over and left the car in the shade to dry<br /><br />I included a picture of the day it rained when I parked the car.
B000CP86ZE|5|this is a very nice accessory to have on any car
B0018MITR0|3|Pros: good size, soft fabric. Cons: too soft (I am 5'5&#34; and 125 pounds and it flattens almost completely when I sit on it).<br /><br />If I sit down carefully, this does give me a small amount of protection for my injured tailbone. I was looking for a cushion that wasn't too firm since those tend to pull on the muscles around my coccyx. However, this one is really too soft. I have been using it for less than a month and the front end is almost totally flat.
B000EBMCQ0|5|Thin metal but looks ok
B001LHVOVK|1|Does not work on my 2005 Toyota Corolla. Get a linkage error despite the fact there is only one way to connect the device. Tried it several times according to the instructions..no luck. Item is past return date so I'm stuck with a piece of crap. Don't buy this unit..does not work even on the most basic of cars.
B00H1I53BA|5|Excellent product, great price.
B00A9T28R0|5|This product is not longer available on the retail market. It is the best car wash of any I have tried. So simple and in these time of water shortages it is a miracle product. Wash it on and dry it off, no rinse necessary. It only takes one bucket to wash a vehicle and you usually have left over to do you windows of your house. This product does not streak and cleans the outside of your house window like magic with little effort! A must try product, if you can find it!!
B0017M86W4|1|The product is worthless.  It claims it fits all 6 1/2 ft. beds and most 8ft.  In reality it doesn't even fit a 6 1/2 ft bed.  I own an F250 and stretched tight it is about 4 inches too short leaving a gap in the front and isn't wide enough to stretch across the bed leaving gaps on both sides.  Items I have put in the back when raining have been drenched.  What a waste of money.
B000LQ9YEG|5|Used this for a portable flashlight and works good. Cant think of anything funny to say.
B001D20X4W|5|good product and excellent price
B001LN03LG|5|good
B000R4P8AG|4|This button assembly works as designed and looks as shown, but I thought it was stainless steel.  Nope.  The same button around here in the auto store is half the price.
B00BVB5SYU|5|Worked Excellent for my 2004 Sunfire!
B00W2XEOQE|1|Purchased these and installed them properly on Sunday morning. Passengers side front fell off on way to work this morning Tuesday (yes 2 days after properly installing them) and then on way home had to pull off on highway because the remaining 3 were flapping around and one of them was hanging by about 1/2&#34; of tape once I stopped. Funny thing is the tape came off the guard and was stuck stead fast to the car doors.Someone cut corners when they put tape on these.did a lousy job.
B00BD52QCG|5|Fit like a glove
B005VLM8AI|4|It's reasonable for the price
B00RJUZY9Q|5|GOOD FOR MY LEXUS
B00ZQXSSQY|5|perfect
B00EISJN1M|5|Just what I needed as p promised
B00NTU18KY|4|It was a gift, and my husband says, &#34;It is very cool!&#34;
B00KW1ZEMG|5|worked great
B001AHF494|5|great  filter i bought for my 2007 audi a3 2.0t FSI, it is in fact made by K&N though in case anyone is not sure. i ordered it to replace my oiled K&N that came with my neuspeed p flow intake kit as it seen better days and i was told the dry filter is better for cars with MAF so i figured it was a good time to swap it out. it was a perfect fit for 2.75 piping!  shipping was fast and price was right!
B001CEG90I|1|Does not fit the Subaru BRZ!  Amazon page shows that it will, but it's longer and wider that stock.  DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A BRZ!!!!
B007IWE8QU|5|Fits perfectly and is as described.  Looks great on the back of the hitch.
B000CRDLZM|5|This is a simple tool, although you have to read the instructions carefully to learn how to use it correctly. That said, use it right and you'll get the perfect belt tension with no problems. If your engine belt has always been a bit noisy, maybe your mechanic still thinks he has a &#34;calibrated thumb&#34; and is too cheap to buy one of these. Highly recommended.
B000EPPARY|5|have used these type of sleeves for a lot of years, they do a great job and save a lot of money.  use them, you will be glad you did.
B007H2RR78|5|Very durable
B00B2YE4B4|5|Works perfectly in the dome lights on my 2006 Chrysler 300.<br /><br />Warning - super duper bright. I turn off my dimmer so these don't go off when I open the door at night.
B003U4O414|4|I've seen these types of products save an engine before when run with no oil at all.  Definitely worth using every now and then.  I find the product is good quality, nicely priced and easy packaging.  Definitely recommended.
B009DIWYQI|1|Save your money. OEM filters work better than Spectre. I bought 3 for different vehicles. Mileage declined in all 3.
B000I2SWXC|4|The Bar works great the net works but is a bit small when stretched across a full size pickup bed
B00B7QTR64|1|My steering wheel is the minimum listed size. The thing won't go on even half way. Rubber does not stretch at all!
B0087NB1IW|5|This is a really versatile system that installs quickly and easily, sounds good and is really easy to operate. The battery lasts most of a full weekend of riding, playing music the whole time. I paid $99 for mine and felt it was good value for the money spent. Very happy with this purchase.
B0131ZLRES|5|This unit is amazing great quality simple set up I recommend this AS72005 electric siren made by KNS leds is more than I thought BIG surprise and the price is reasonable!!!!!
B000HBNX38|2|does fine at 1st - but rust came right back when it got hot.
B00AUCCABA|1|It doesn't even come close to my Van, product page it says it suppose to fit my rear door on 2004 Ford  E 250. I  don't even give 1star but it would't let me continue.
B005KDO8U0|4|They are working fine. All I now is their working right now. They were delivered fast. Thanks.
B00ELR3Z7S|5|This Struts works great
B003G0MCN4|5|Fits perfect.  Great addition to my car.
B004BTBUXC|5|As others have said, passenger side doesn't quite fit a 98 Civic and the drivers side has a few gaps but other than that, these are great.  The too big can easily be solved with a knife but I left it because its just not that big a deal.  These are thick rubber and look like OEM (gaps and overage noted). They are also soft.  I drove about 250 miles with my shoes off and these provided a nice cushion surface.  Highly recommended.
B000NJ981K|4|Works as good as most other soaps but better for rv I guess.
B0075OWK4I|5|Tight fit but same as original worked fine
B00K73QBKS|2|Hooks are hard to remove .
B00HJ6O4A0|3|Just ok.  I have a similar fold up mat that feels more like a blanket and thats what I was expecting.  This however is hard and plastic feeling.  It has come in handy on occasion (we use it to set up a bounce house in our yard on) but not the soft picnic blanket i had in mind.  Not bad for the price.
B007UTPUDQ|5|Fast shipping. Product was as described.
B00KB5077A|5|Great
B002G39DZ2|5|Great Price<br />Great Product<br />Quick Shipping
B000F285EG|2|stops rattles- that's where the fun ends! after one month mounted on my truck it just split at one end- looks like a weird molding flaw. odd that there seems to be absolutely no warranty info on the hi-lift website and amazon only offers 30 days- I wont buy another one so I guess its back to a wrapped bungee!
B004X5QMY6|5|THIS WAS VERY WELL MADE, WAS GREAT FOR THE PRICE. THEY WANTED DOUBLE THE PRICE AT MY LOCAL PARTS STORE .THIS ITEM DROPED RIGHT IN EVERY LINE HOOKED UP. GREAT ITEM.
B00KTJ0IW2|4|Works fine - key can be cut and programmed to work with Pontiac G6 using the ignition switch, but FOB requires dealer or locksmith with computer programmer to work.
B000RZ5XXM|2|It looks good initially, but other than that I would AVOID buying this. It hasn't even been 4 months and mine has completely lost it's color, and looks horrible. I would definitely look at a different emblem because this is clearly cheap, plastic material.
B002UC4UHK|5|very good product easy install nice and bright
B00032KC30|5|Looks great with my stainless frames
B00E9HWPMG|4|I thought this would cover more area in my Odyssey. It looks fine but with dirty kids I need more coverage.
B006ZCK1ZG|4|Will need to alter to drop about 2 inches but otherwise great in all categories
B00GTQD20E|1|I was not able to use this carb,  There is a cable that goes from the top of the carb past  the fuel tank and I could not use the old cable and a new one did not come with the new carburetor..  I finally had to have a mechanic repair the old carb to the tune of $195.<br />Would like to return it but its probably too late now.
B00CHDDNCK|5|Looks great to me
B0031GTXQW|5|Thank you! Perfect since my husband left mine at the gas station
B00557QI0Y|5|Fit my 2007 Buick Terraza, easy install, and it works.  What more is there to say?  Our rear windshield wiper has been out for over a year.. maybe longer.  I don't know why I waited so long to change it out.. the hardest part was taking the door apart, so get yourself some tools for that.  They cost $6 here on Amazon and I have already used them several times for a variety of repairs on the car.
B00KSY3HFS|1|Didn't fit, not even close.
B009GIUVYW|5|Arrived ahead of schedule. Genuine Volvo part. Typical Volvo in difficult to install, but that is not an issue of service
B004GCAN9G|5|Exact replacement for my damaged factory tag bracket.
B00AFWO9VE|5|Easy to install and works great.  Really helps with air flow. Delivery was fast.
B000C32JAO|5|iMickey503 here of Chryslerminivan.net fame.  Helps when you are not drunk when writing reviews.  But here is goes.  Not only can this belt stop your Car from making that GOD AWFUL  Chirp Chirp noise.  IT WIll totally help you score on a date in your minivan.  And help out with street cred.  Really, this belt in all seriousness will solve pulley alignment issues.  Stock belts work great (Dayco)  if the pulleys are all in perfect alignment.  For me it is a issue with the main crank pulley being wobbly.  It will not help if your belt falls off.  Or any other issue.  But it will quiet your Belt drive and stop bad chirps on 1996-2000 (Gen 3 Minivan)  For anyone that knows, Belts fall off these vans like clockwork in the rain if you have the crappy Metal pulleys.  We found on our forum,  (or This dude who did actually)  that the metal pulleys are just not up to par on these vans and you should use the plastic guide pulley if you can. with the lip.<br /><br />There is a whole Gates kit that solves the belt from falling of if that is happening to you.  OR you can use the Flying puck Dorman &#34;hat&#34; that will keep the pulley from falling of the belt drive if you have problems with the belt falling off.  I like to go through puddles a lot, so it is standard equipment for all my vans.<br /><br />Now as far as belts go, this is he gold standard of belts.  It really is nice not having to hear that Loud squeak of the belt in the morning.  And also, this belt can be purchased anywhere, so if you have issues getting the gates belt kit, this is a good option.<br /><br />And my girlfriend always beats me at pool.  That cool.<br /><br />So,  get this if you want to not look so ghetto, while driving your van.
B002MQCY7C|1|Do not purchase these!  I've been fighting with this for over a month.  It is hit or miss connecting this, most of the time just half connected, which feels and sounds totally connected.  But if you miss, have fun trying to disconnect them.  Unfortunately I missed the return policy deadline or I would return them
B004O9WC18|4|Perfect for protecting my carpet. Does what they are suppose  to do with trapping  water, dirt and other things that are dropped. However I have had experiences  where my feet slip due to the water. The water freezes in the winter time overnight.
B00YE360TO|5|Installed in the center console of a 2014 Audi Q5 2.0T.  Well made and fitted perfectly and caused no interference with the armrest.  Certainly provides more storage in the console by creating a top tray over what was previously just a single bin.
B0009I4U1S|5|Works perfectly. Fast shipping. Thank you
B005T7ZL7G|3|It's stylish but you have to consider that you may not close the windows as usual.<br /><br />I just finished installing them to my 2012 odyssey. They looked so nice.<br /><br />However, the windows little suffer to be closed.<br /><br />If I were you, I would buy Honda's genuine window visors which are more expensive around $240.<br />Why? It's simple. Styling and the price is not the important matters.<br />I have little regret to buy this product but I'm not gonna return them. Actually I couldn't take them out.<br /><br />If you have enough budget, go for Honda's genuine window visors.<br />If you don't, this product might be good substitution but personally I won't take it.<br />I'm really worrying about my windows... &#62;.&#60;
B00ARZZ2VA|5|Nothing too exciting.  It's a standard RV 30A service to standard US household plug.  Used this when I went tent camping with the family at an electrified site.  No problems at all, and the lit end made it very easy to tell if we had power or not.<br /><br />A nice bonus for the light?  Helps you see where it's laying at night, to prevent tripping.<br /><br />If you enjoy tent camping, but need electricity to run some household electronics (Laptops, phone chargers, etc etc), this is a must have.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to do the above.
B005G7Y2XS|5|Works great.
B001LHVOVK|5|Works great
B004323RS8|5|I bought this to replace a standard &#34;drinking water&#34; hose for filling the water tank the camper. This is much lighter, takes up much less space. I would be hesitant to use it for supplying pressurized water to the camper, but for filling the tank it works quite well.
B0050SYFXU|5|Fit perfectly in my 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX. Easy to install, and works great. Fraction of the cost of getting it through the dealer.
B00NFSNAS8|5|Recovering from back surgery the lite weight of this  product was very welcome.  I like that it has two plug adapters one being one you can plug into your car for tire roadside blowups.  Also the multi head adapters are very useful.  I would recommend this product.
B008AH50QE|5|I installed it inside my vehicle rather than outside since these are illegal to use in Virginia while driving.  I used double sided tape to attach to plastic moldings and routed all the wires to my glovebox where i have the controller box.  My daughters think our SUV is so cool now while my neigbors think i'm insane!!!  I take both as a compliment!!<br /><br />No real instructions on how to us the remote but this is what i found out:<br />Button A - turns off the lights<br />Button B - turns on the lights<br />Button C - changes the 7 colors<br />Button D - changes the timing of the flashing
B0066RUGGE|5|THIS worked so great for fixing my FORD FREESTYLE!!!!! and so much cheaper than taking my car to the shop!!! holycrap! WE SAVED SO MUCH USING THIS ONE!!! we literally just had to cute the part that sticks out, a few minutes with a saw(prepare to replace the blade) and we were good to go!
B004BTHSZ6|5|Been using prolong in my jeep since 2001, 2 or 3 times a year. I have almost 160000 miles on it and don't burn any oil whatsoever
B010H33WLS|1|According to manufacturer, it should fit the 2005 Toyota Sienna. It does not. It's dimensions are incompatible. I am a mechanical engineer and had no problem installing this, so trust me, it does not fit.
B009AQSCQE|5|for $13, you can't beat these lights with a stick. i'm also using them for bowfishing, and couldn't be happier. Keep in mind, fishermen, these are &#34;cool white&#34; lights, not warm lights. if you're fishing in murky water, these may not be the best choice. HOWEVER, i cant find any warm lights as good as these, anywhere in this price range. if needed, i'll just use yellow cellophane and change the light color. Best LED buy is right here
B0027M3A1U|4|Works well but not a miracle cleaner. Still had to reluctantly power wash my rv. Still requires scrubbing on my pretty new rv which is parked under trees. It cut through the black grime but didn't get the deeper dirt without scrubbing. I washed with outside average temperature water. Maybe warmer water would have helped. I did use a car mop to wash it but it wasn't enough for me. It does leave a noticeable shine and left the windows clean and streak free with just a good rinse.
B00MX9SN5A|5|Fit & finish is perfect
B008BMN8X0|5|Nice Bright White Lights
B00PV37ZEA|5|Perfect to use in my car
B00IS92RYC|1|they don`t fit
B000BGM7QS|5|No problems, got what I ordered.
B000CPAR5Q|5|I've used Russell fittings for years and  never had a problem. I still have Russell fittings that I use with Methanol Fuel (very corrosive) that are in use to this day and that's about 15 years now ! Reliable, great fit, average/ comparable pricing, and readily available make them a great choice. The only other fittings I've also used with great success  which I can recommend are Aeroquip, Earl's, and Fragola. Would I buy this product again? Yes. Would I recommend this product? Yes.
B00T8T1IXC|4|easy to use, worked well to cover the chips
B00CC4LX2G|5|This product looks good in my truck at night. And gives out good lighting.
B00M1X6F9Y|5|Product arrived with box busted on it end, however the product was in great condition. The workmanship was top notch. Very well built heavy duty piece.
B008MISDH4|5|A difference you can feel when switching from regular oil. quieter and smooth shifts
B0009IQZH0|5|Love these towels, easy on the paint and does a great job.
B00172LDFG|5|This turn signal relocation is awesome. It changes the whole look of the back of the bike. I needed a kit for a set of saddlebags I put on my fatboy and I feel this one ends up looking the best and at a great price.
B00C7XV8K4|4|This is a good looking and well built part.  It took it an extreme amount of time to get to me.  Shipping was very slow.
B00IU22TJ0|5|Was just what I was looking for!
B005VNM1EO|4|It works as expected.  I couldn't tell any substantial differences from the OEM part I removed from the truck.
B00PFMANYG|5|Bien
B00QMWQJRS|3|great price but mats slide around some.
B00CLH3ZWU|3|These tie rods are definitely BAD ASS but I don't like that I have to keep tightening the bolts every time I ride as well as on the trail. Even after putting red loctite on them they still come loose. Better hardware is a must with these. Other than that they're pretty awesome!!
B00DWKWSTG|3|A little hard to mount compared to my old HIDs but fit well enough in a 2011 scion tc.
B007G2J1JG|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00H2VATFG|4|No instructions but it was fairly straight forward.  i looked up installation on youtube and that helped quite a bit.
B00MIH4SXS|5|Very nice!! Fits well...
B003502LUO|4|Good
B00UXKQB00|5|Good quality, looks like oem
B005TCM854|4|Exhaust rubs my leaf springs on my 1999 F250 4 door short bed
B0002SRH8I|5|Very satisfied, thank you for your help finding this for me
B004HMBK5G|5|I've had this at least 10 years - still working great.  Now I need to add one to another car. It's great the company and product name is molded into the product, so I could identify exactly what I'm looking for. All it took was one search using the words on the little gadget, and here the same thing is on Amazon, right where I hoped to find it.
B007KW9OOY|5|Nice addition to a nice car! No rusted crap made in China!
B00HX2Q2NW|4|Generic color & look etc., but that's what it is.
B00K24JB2W|5|nifty
B00NUZ90H6|5|its wonderfull. thanx
B007R4M3KC|3|Recieved intact, looks to be nice strong plastic I will complete review when I've used them :-)
B006EHXB1I|5|These are the best belts money can buy .... used for a LS1 application with a underdrive pully and a larger dr44 alternator. Worked flawlessly and quietly.
B00BU2E0WQ|5|Got them very fast and they fit.
B00TLC42BG|4|Little noises
B000B8YLQU|1|Product arrived DOA.  The jack acted like there was no power to it.  Neither the jack nor the light would work.  We ordered this to replace a defective Ultra-Fab, hoping the new product testing claimed on their website improved their product quality.  Based on a defective product arriving we are sending it back and never purchasing Ultra-Fab products again.
B00GWF4CYW|4|These lights look amazing at night! Plenti of the light shines everywhere. But when you turn on both lights the 2 sides flicker
B000BPLNPU|5|Just as described.  Will order again.
B00GTR3SFW|3|Good product and affordable, although I assumed it was a &#34;pair&#34; or set of 2 (one for each side). Still satisfied.
B00FOX57UG|5|Well worth it if you have hids.
B0000DCPDR|4|It works just like advertised.
B001O1X65A|5|Use this meter a lot. Agrees well with my other meters (w/in 0.01 volt)
B002MEZUKW|2|Nice looking and easy to install.  However this exhaust system sounds identical to the factory exhaust.  I was hoping for a more aggressive sound like other reviewers mentioned.  If you are looking for more aggressive sound I would not suggest this product.
B00D9QASU4|3|stand seems to be rusty out of the package! Missing mounting screws!!!
B00KARB7V4|4|Seams as good as any other soap or wash. Suppose to be better for awning though I guess
B00EA2VQ66|5|So cute ... and they match my pink zebra-striped seat covers.  They are holding up well, even tho they are plastic.
B003VMZG80|5|Love it!!
B007UMD300|5|These are cool. Great quality. Love having them on my bike as a scratch free key chain.
B000C2CAXQ|5|Great product and easy transaction....Thanks
B00PBZKDRY|5|Get it. It is better than those thick ones that you snap on.  It is easy to sow; just need to take your time, but it's definitely worth it.
B001UCBUQ0|5|bang for buck points here -
B002UC4Y6C|5|I own a 2012 GMC sierra, easy to install lights on trailer work perfect.
B003S5XCDQ|4|Required elongating the screw holes so the snap connector on the fender could fit.  Otherwise the lower section is white plastic and thick.  Seems to work OK.
B000QJG1HG|5|As expected good product
B00X1QBW7K|5|Awesome gloves
B003ZS32CW|5|Perfect fit
B00KWN73EG|5|got them for my mom. she loved them
B007Z8VG30|5|Exactly as advertised.
B004SCIY6S|5|Caps good.
B000ETQMIQ|3|it will not stand up unleass it's full.  needs more support.
B00NO783UA|5|Footlights came quick when n Easy and works great
B00BY2220O|5|Great stool, works well as a step stool or a seat.  It's a bit taller than most step stools which is nice.  Built well, seems sturdy, folds up and slides into a 2-inch wide space between my fridge and kitchen cabinet.  If you need a step stool, buy this one.
B00XX4PVHC|5|thc dent puller does  it's  job  .<br />it's a lot better  than the dent lifter
B00DRUIBUQ|2|I order a size 10, they were too small for a 10.
B000O0B26W|5|Perfect fit and no complains thank you
B00F23BNUG|4|Better light than standard 1157 bulbs that they replace, still could use higher lumens.
B000C7328S|5|Much better than OEM Honda rotors. Reasonably priced.
B00Y85UM7O|5|Fit my impreza very well! Have been using for a month, so far looks very sturdy.
B00T9GNAYE|5|Excellent quality. Was very pleased with both the look and feel of the product. This is a good choice for either a driving light or an auxiliary off-road light. I received a discount on this product for providing a fair and honest review.
B007N6EFJG|5|Great. And very good communication.
B00CM585YY|3|Not the same as the Absorber.  Its about half as thick requiring me to wring it out twice as often.  I guess you get what you pay for, but I won't be buying one of these agian.
B000KLWFWA|5|Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. Seems to have increased my gas milage by 1 and 1/2 mile per gallon. Very good quality. I put it on in about 30 minutes in my garage with minimum tools. Instructions were very well written and had good pictures and detail to be able to fully understand installation.
B004QHJJ1E|1|I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.  After paying $300 in labor to have them installed we found out that the wheel bearings were bad.  What could I do at that point!  I now have to have the job done all over again.
B00186LFRM|5|satisfied
B00KTR4T2Y|5|Love this exhaust had it taken to a professional shop local..<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwGFQ4wIDak<br /><br />that is with cats still in.. they give you extenders for the g35.. they fit perfect as test pipes.. just have them drill and wield in flanges for the 02 sensors.. As with any exhaust there is a smell that comes off it for a little while. This goes away i hope.
B00G620ZVU|5|Great Product and Fast Shipping
B0074A97LM|5|cant get it to work
B0002JMDAE|5|Smells fantastic, and keeps leather looking great - I will buy again
B00B9Z86F6|3|Did not come with advertised rivets. Had to use glue to attach
B000F5ECUY|5|Works wonderfully!  Another nice, solid, reasonably priced tool from OTC.  Arrived in a timely manner as well.  Thank You!
B005MKR7CC|5|Soft and easy to install.  Good fit and durable.
B00062YVT8|5|Works great. Very responsive needle. The light is brighter than other gauges a have.
B00749OJ6Q|5|Worked like it should, and fit just right, and for a good price.
B00KMWE2L4|5|Works great! It does everything I need it to and more, I really like the color.
B0002UEMZ2|5|Good material to keep the vibes from separating your equipment.  Frank
B000CC4O58|1|Didn't stay on very long,didn't stick like it said it would.
B000VKTULY|5|Works great
B004LLQNL4|5|My husband was jealous of my heated seats so I got him this.  He LOVES it.  Works as it's supposed to and is inexpensive!  Great for miserable Midwest winters.
B00MEUMDRM|5|THEY WERE THE RIGHT PARTS THE FIRST TIME@ AGOOD PRICE.
B00KTJ3ZMW|4|Works perfect
B0010E00T6|5|Seriously, you can do this yourself in a matter of minutes. Just look up the video on YouTube. Honda wanted $130 to change my cabin and engine air filter. I bought both on amazon for under $40.<br /><br />The filter itself fits like a glove and freshens the air.
B0014E3MSI|4|Camco 59013 does the job well for my 1957 Westerner Camper, with propane stove/oven, light and catalytic heater.  It does vent more than the old one that I replaced as it regulates the pressure.  Over all it was a good value, I used free Amazon Prime 2 day shipping, it arrived via post office on Sunday.  I would buy again if I needed a 200,000 btu regulator.
B000QQXAHI|5|Worked great.  Took the thumping noise out of the front end.  I bought to sets just to have one on hand.
B00KQXKG46|5|Nice and bright. Make sure you note that wiring harness does not come with this light.  First bar I bought I didn't realize that.  Second one, ordered a wiring kit at same time.
B004GDWOFG|4|It fits nicely on my car. I am happy with the buy.
B0016IVQE4|5|Very good
B0007RVLX6|5|Im 65 yrs old an have used 100s waxs with out a doubt it is the best !!
B000GTZREY|5|Before you order a Dynatek Ignition System, check to see if you have a 7 or 8 pin setup.  This will save you the pain of ordering one of these, which I waited nearly a month for.
B0043SCBD4|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B005FKXRIC|5|So far so good.  My other rotors were warped and these made a huge difference in stopping.  I hope they last.
B00PT18QAQ|4|So far so good.  Bought 3 so I'd have one for each vehicle.  Too bad there isn't a small case to keep the face dust/damage free.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works great.  Used with the Battery Tender 081-0069-6 Ring Terminal harness.  Hooked up to my Note 4 and it charges fine.
B004SJ16QG|1|Don't store this stuff!!  We have had it in a climate controlled storage room.  It EXPLODED today, spraying that stuff all over everything in the room.  What a mess!!!
B0002SR47M|5|Thank you very much for a good product and quick delivery, worked very well and did the job, it was good doing bussiness with you and would do again !
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Check your windshield size. I didn't, thinking that it would fit fine, but it still tends to fall even with the shades folded towards the windshield. 2016 Hyundai Elantra. Good quality however.
B000FW61SI|1|Very disappointed in the quality.  1 had a corner broken,  not what I expected. Would not recommend to anyone .
B00KCQSOAA|5|it's good and fit. look cool '
B004K7X4D4|4|Big difference in ride and handling on my 2005 F250, of course it still had the original Rancho shocks on it and they were completely shot.
B00OACB9NQ|3|Pretty thin but its worth da cost when your seats are wearing
B012E87QHU|5|My best friend and her husband recently became parents and I love giving them unique gifts. I actually saw something like this on reddit, but I never thought I'd ever be able to find it in real life. When I saw these on Amazon, I jumped on it! The magnet is strong and the finish is shiny and durable. It's a fun &#34;joke&#34; gift that makes everyone smile!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a promotional discount for my honest review.
B001R8WP0M|4|With a little MacGuyvering it works great just sitting on my garage floor
B002TPRNFE|4|great product. A little smelly.
B00FQQTK90|5|Great! I love it!
B000KIMHRQ|5|My husband was thrilled with it. It does everything he needs to do.
B00T5JS7DY|2|Poor
B007HFT034|5|A+
B012LQNPNE|5|Down side is that it did not come with instructions...  I had to use YouTube for installation. Nice set up and the light are extremely bright. I suggest buying this product. Fast shipping and great quality.  I can't wait to take my Jeep off-road!!!
B004UQIUKW|5|used on windshield with cerium oxide to remove pits .
B00RV4BOGM|5|[[VIDEOID:87b690a0ddb1ee9752ec7b5aee8f95]] Exactly what I was looking for! I recently put a plate bumper on my 1st gen tacoma, and so I lost the stock mounting location for the blinkers. I could have installed an alternative set in the bumper, but opted to instead turn the marker lights into dual purpose blinkers/parking lights. These worked exactly as advertized. They are super bright, and no one has any trouble seeing them. There's a slight delay when you activate the parking lights, but that was to be expected. An unforeseen consequence of this is that when I lock or unlock my doors using the key fob, the front parking lights no longer light up, as the power does not stay on long enough to activate them. No big deal for me, but something to consider. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase. In order to make the bulbs fit, I did have to silicon the bases into the housing. The bulbs are so long, this was somewhat of a challenge.
B0006MRRU8|5|It was exactly what I needed.
B006GGI6P8|5|It fits convertibles
B002E1AYTU|5|perfect
B007W6B4OQ|5|I had this installed by my local Toyota dealership. I talked with the tech that was going to do the install and gave him a heads up that these tend to set off the oxygen sensors after installation. Since my 2014 FJ (Yes, that is correct...2014 FJ even though the description says 2010-2012 models) only had about 1000 miles on it he didn't think it would be a problem but said he would would rest the sensors and reprogram the computer chip control just in case. So far no warning lights have activated and I now have about 3000 miles on the FJ. Although it was not fully &#34;broken in&#34; I was getting about 14 to 15 mpg in town before the install. And now, after this was added (along with a free-flow cat-back exhaust pipe), I am getting  about 20 mpg in town. We will see what the highway mileage is like this winter when I am traveling to see the KC Chiefs play. (I live in southern MO and the Chiefs play in northern MO, about 300 miles round-trip). I will try to remember to update this review later this year (2015) or maybe early next year.
B004TG3R6U|2|it did not fit. it was 2&#34; or more to short in height
B007OW6MD6|5|They look like drain plug gaskets to me, so not much else to say, except that I'm going to start replacing them at every oil change like you're supposed to!
B000C8Z7YE|5|PERFECT !
B000OGXITK|4|The gloves fit, they are reasonably well constructed, and I am confident they would protect my hands in a crash. The gauntlet that extends over your wrist/jacket cuff is a bit tight, even with the Velcro fully loosened. They could just left the Velcro tab off. If you want an inexpensive, but functional glove this could meet your needs.
B0010FS1F0|5|Easy to install to my 2006 Toyota Rav4.... Perfectly fit and reasonable price....Quiet and smooth... the good thing is, it comes with the hardware as well...great!!!!
B00ED81S0Q|5|Sticker looks just like the picture. I have had it for a year and it has survived through heave rain and many car washes. Really nice strong sticker.
B000KA7UR6|5|Excellent Quantity!  Looks great on my truck!
B002HVH8E6|5|Simple to install replaced both mirrors in 10 minutes.
B007KTINX0|5|Excellent product. Not a fan of the scent.
B000KL7NZE|1|This thing couldn't even take surface rust off of22ga sheet metal
B00SVNRJ6Q|4|Fits a 2001 Toyota Tundra perfect!
B001EOV45G|5|Ordered on Monday; arrived the following Wednesday and fit perfect!
B005OEAAIY|5|good deal, you would pay twice as much at any truck stop.
B00RZ4YTCO|4|this is what i wanted and will serve me well.
B00NUJ23J4|5|This product worked just as the description explained. They fit perfectly and literally only took 2 mins to install it says its a 2 person job but i did it alone and still wasnt difficult at all.
B0031ZDU62|5|I had a misfiring cylinder and didn't want to invest a lot of money into my old truck. I bought a whole set of these for less than one would have cost at the local parts store. Thus far, I have only installed one of these in the cylinder that had a misfire. Truck runs great. Now I have 7 more COP's I can install, or just keep in reserve for when any others fail. Terrific deal.
B00KSUA6HY|1|I bought two packages of 10 plus the bigger lights for the cabin. Of the big ones only 2 work,<br />Of the 2 packages only 5 are working of 20 lights. That was a waste of money.<br />I will give an 1/8 of a star but I can. My front cluster on my car is pretty dark.<br />I dump my all lights before I knew these were dead on arrival .
B0068M09YQ|5|Excellent OEM fit to my 2011 MB GL-450 - looks and works great. Unlike other windshield wipers that use different adapters to accommodate different kinds of mounting, which causes the windshield arm to protrude and stick out causing noise and just ugly look, this blades fit perfectly.<br />Very happy
B00TF7BVWK|1|The handles ripped off instantly! Cheaply made cargo holder.
B00J62WAFQ|5|Perfect
B007ZLN0ZY|2|rubber broke after not even a year, amazon replace it and the 2nd pair broke even sooner, I changed both and the second one broke too right after 1 year warranty, I ended up by another company. you get what you pay for. Moog has now a premium line of control arm with better bushing, I wish they had it before
B00NASRFUM|4|Fit my 05 V star 1100 midnight custom factory sissy bar perfect!!
B002EWNVV2|3|I liked a lot but they had I lay scratch
B00407GO72|5|Rear bumper caps fit good and look good
B00AKA3RLO|5|Looks great on my F150!
B00J0ABMWG|5|Does what it's supposed to do. Good match for an aluminum hitch.
B00E6OO5ES|3|Not sure if it was a packaging problem, but the tip of the antenna was bent and there was a crease in the metal.  The antenna works fine, but I was disappointed to open it and find it bent.  For the purchase price, I didn't feel like doing a return since it works.
B00HNP91VO|5|Awesome light!!! Just make sure you get the wiring kit too!!
B00029JXNE|2|I bought it july 2014 and august 2015 it quit. Still looks new if that means anything. Guess we buy something cheap we just take our chances. Its a 50 year old car and it sits more than goes but speedometer was broke and was using tack to gage speed. Not the end of the world....Robert
B00RFCDN6O|5|My boyfriend loves them!
B00722XX9Y|1|My car is a 2005 Hyundai tuscon
B0094DBRNS|1|Not impressed at all
B008XB9BJY|5|The bulb arrived without damage.  It was no different to install than a standard bulb.  It worked without any issues and continues to work well..
B00L2NY3NY|5|Installed in 2010 G37, all good
B00PG78W9I|3|You will still get Scratches in it. you have to be very careful when cleaning it.<br />It will keep the wind off you but it does bow in about 1.5&#34; in the center when going 65 mph<br />The hardware is starting to rust (nuts and bolts) mainly the hinge bolt.
B001NYE24C|5|Fits as expected an way cheaper than Nappa! (31.99) plus came with hole for sensor.
B000M5Y720|5|Love them. Look good, very bright and the price was right.
B007ROUBYC|5|good buy...used same wiring harness. Simple battery replacement on the Razor scooter.
B001CF1RJ0|5|Very happy with the quality of this rack it also matches the support
B00EK5CEI2|4|Nowhere near as dark as the picture they are a smoky gray at best. still better than stock light housing. though
B001UCGOQ6|5|Quality parts at a great price. Quick shipping, on-time delivery as promised.
B002QUJ92C|5|Great classes, couldn't find them anywhere local or for the price. Keeps the wind out when riding the motorcycle , which is just what I was looking for. Love them.
B00BCRMBSO|3|This didn't fit my car, was very hard to install, many different pieces, instructions not fully understandable. it said it would fit, but didn't. But after contacting customer service they agreed to send me a refund and I could keep the product! Will give this to my friend, maybe it fits her car.
B00JH2GMMC|5|Changed out in less then 5 min. Good replacement.
B002PNRVZC|4|Good product, wide steps, but I had hoped for a flatter ladder as I have to slide it into the kitchen between the counter and the fridge. Otherwise an OK item.
B008TG8O3W|2|I can not believe that i received a used or a rebuilt one with marks of oil and tie wrap all over.
B00064LQL2|5|Works great in my 4Runner with LED blinkers
B003YK44FA|5|Easy to install! Works great! Fairly well hidden.
B00QRHDIPY|4|This solar panel does exactly what it stated. I use on my car dashboard to maintain my battery . The red indicator light appears to stay on all the time . The only problem is the plastic cover on the solar panel melts and shrivel up under the hot sun and heat within the vehicle .
B00RH3AMIS|5|The tie down loops were what I was looking for, I would recommend them./
B00SAAW8Y8|5|Litterly was perfect99.9% love it I had to extend one ground wire but everything else was pefect! This is an honest review!!! No joke
B0012GTVVA|5|Used now for several several camping trips and still very solid. Family of 4 plus in-laws going in and out during meal time and everyone using and liking the pull bar.
B00K5A9B2I|5|Yes it arrived quickly I was very satisfied
B007J3DJZ4|5|good
B004PILLZG|5|Need to use a heat gun and roller for installation.  Excellant adhesion once heated.  Have not had a chance to test for sound transfer.
B00DHRHOFW|1|Very noisy made a loud whine pitch sound. It lowered our trade in value
B008SANL5A|5|Love it
B00IZZDRR0|5|This product is often &#34;Temporarily out of stock&#34; for good reason. It is one sturdy, well made step platform made of welded steel that is wide enough and just high enough to step in and out of the camper. Many of the stools may be lighter and smaller-for that, they may get a good rating. But for ruggedly built, larger dimensions safety,felt carpeted for traction, Quick Products is an excellent choice. This stool has folding legs for convenient storage. Granted, steel is a bit heavy and it is painted. We would have preferred aluminum. But where safety, strength and durability matter, we can live with steel. The one improvement that we did make was to pad the feet with rubber squares found at the local home improvement stores. They were cheap and keep the &#34;feet&#34; dry on a wet surface..
B009LOOI0Y|3|Love the tuner.  But save your money and buy the tunes somewhere else.  The MPT tunes on my truck were horrible.  2003 f-250 6.0.
B009RC2HVC|5|great part
B00OS9G4F4|5|Love it.
B00KIFTXJ6|1|Not GM part, not chrome, and not as pictured.  All plastic, no clear coat on main emblem, looks real cheap, and no way would this stay on the vehicle if I put it on it.
B00V30J86I|5|arrived in great condition
B00VD17UDU|5|Used as part of the decoration for &#34;get away car&#34; for daughters wedding, big hit for the happy couple.
B00R6IWD4K|5|great seller - delivered as promised!
B000BLI23A|3|If you have a z71 suburban don't buy these. They don't fit even though the vehicle selector says it will...
B000C0WKHO|4|Fit 2002 Chrysler Sebring 2.4 DOHC good quality belt.
B000CJ8D7Q|5|Just as good as OEM. I like the color, makes it easier to monitor age and wear.
B00V0CGV1Y|4|Material is cheap, but it will do the job for a little bit until the mesh starts to rip.
B009F70NSI|5|The BMW M54b25 motor is super smooth, but can lack punch if the DISA is not fully functional.  My car has 160K miles on it and has been fanatically maintained so every little thing tends to bring out the OCD in me.  I noticed the pick up and mid-range acceleration wasn't quite as crisp and zippy as it used to be.  All the intake boots, vacuum lines, VANOS seals, valve cover gaskets and rubber grommets, oil pan, OFHG, and other things have also been replaced so not much left to do until it's time to do it all over again soon.  :-)<br /><br />The original DISA failed the vacuum test.  Twist the flap closed and Hold your finger over the hole is supposed to keep the flap in the same position, however, the internal diaphragm appeared to have failed.  With the new one, the test shows what a properly working DISA vacuum test is supposed to do.  Once installed, the new DISA restored the mid-range power and brought the performance back.
B000C59KTU|5|Nice shocks truck rides a lot better
B007M5QH6C|4|worked well
B00EQDFIW2|5|Great Plate and Fair price
B0002JN2EU|5|Stopped my mower's engine surges.
B00KTIUM88|5|Works great, been using it for about a month with no issues at all
B006RMQCFW|5|works great
B001GH1PU0|4|Threw the instructions away, cant get light to come on when switch is on. Works great otherwise
B00BAZBYTU|1|Did not work was a piece of junk
B00CCZ15Q4|4|The right brightness but not the right hotness. Be careful when using for long times are near flammable things.
B003VAX3IC|3|Too short,  get the 6' instead
B00HGHM468|5|No more cramped and sore hand and wrist,wish I knew about this a long time ago!
B001C6OYYO|5|ok
B00GLQBDVM|3|Brake pedal was damaged but i used them anyway the damage made it harder to install but i got it done
B00Z6P2R00|3|I purchased these replacement mirrors for my 2001 Honda CBR 600 F4i back in July 2015 after one of my mirrors broke. I needed them ASAP so I  decided to have one day shipping done. Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was the flimsy stems. I have always been skeptical of these because of their plastic construction and still am. At higher speeds (80-90 mph) the mirrors fold back in no matter how much you tighten them to the base. As for the integrated turn signals, the wires are ridiculously small and had to be soldered to the bike's wiring harness in order to ensure  a sturdy connection. Nonetheless, the left turn signal failed within about a week of use. Overall the quality of the mirrors are not that great, they seem to be cheaply made and feel like they will snap off at any moment. The only reason I give these mirrors 3 stars is simply because they still function as mirrors .
B001TZEIBM|5|Worked great..No clogging..I recommend....
B00FMZ0SSM|5|Great price ... Nice cover.
B00NFSNAS8|1|This unit replaces an old Craftsmen model that plugs into the cigarette port of my Toyota Prius. I've always been nervous about over-taxing the electrical system of the Prius because it's a hybrid, so I wanted to get one that plugs into the normal ol' 110V electrical system. I've used it to pump up bicycle tires, basketballs, soccer balls and car tires. It seems to do the job, if slowly (e.g., getting from 32 to 36 psi on one of the Prius can take 8-10 minutes). The unit gets pretty hot while it's working hard.<br /><br />Update January 2016:<br />The pump stopped working after about 6 months and maybe a dozen uses, mostly to inflate the tires on my Prius (the other uses were to inflate soccer/footballs). The pump still gets power, but it's not maintaining a seal. You can hear a hissing sound no matter how the needle is seated. Since I've used it successfully the pump before, I'm pretty sure this is not user error.
B00H4Y648C|3|Cup Bowl did not fit. Still looking for cup bowls to fit Toyota Corolla Axio 2009 model.
B00J47EQNC|5|I love these they look amazing in my truck!
B00M1WBUQ8|5|its what I needed and very affordable
B005MZWUXS|5|It's big. The graphic is high quality. Magnet is sufficient. I've put it on the door that goes from the garage to the kitchen. However, others in my household refuse to follow this suggestion. And sometimes when I see it out of the corner of my eye, I read it as &#34;no winning&#34;. So potentially, it can serve a dual purpose.<br /><br />No seriously, I chuckle a little on the inside every time I walk out the door.
B0027JY7F6|5|Love the glove!
B008KWBAKY|5|Love this helmet! Flip down sun shades on the inside is a cool feature, has good ventilation (does not fog up on long stand stills with visor down) is very solid and have not had any problems with rattles. My advice if you're new to motorcycling, go to your local store and try on a few helmets and then go online and order! This helmet's colors are great, they matched my 2015 Yamaha FZ-07's Blue wheels! Also, the helmet comes with a helmet bag, and is DOT and ECE R 22.05 Certified!
B009TA0RF0|2|These turn signals look nice and bright which is probably the only saving quality they have. The quality does not feel that great, but hopefully they will hold up for a long time. They are not flush with the fairing and sink in quite a bit. If they were protruding a little that would have been much better than how they actually seat. They don't come with connectors like the stock turn signals, so I cut the ends and soldered them to keep the same connection if you need to take the fairings off. I wouldn't recommend these as a flush mount option. Shipping was also oddly long to get from Texas to Ohio. I believe it was 12 or 13 days.
B00E1SM6D6|4|Great price , easy install, less than 2 hours, for both, seem to be a really good product but don't know how long they will last only time will tell. The only problem I had was I ordered for a 2007 Silverado and the ABS wire harness connector was not the same you will need to cut and splice your old connector or like I did unscrew the harness from the hub and use the old harness.
B00XTRWC4I|4|Light and attaches easily. Probably not worth the 30$ but still good product.
B009IE2JTE|5|thank you for such great service and such grat value this is most great ceo should be very proud of you from purchase to shipping thank you all wow thank you
B0006HP9ZS|5|Fit well as advertised on c5 z06. No issues
B005FNKSMW|5|Perfect fit and holds a charge like it should.
B002YKGLUW|4|Item is as described
B00BYH6C1E|5|Works as advertised. Simple, yet brilliant.
B005HG0DRM|5|Large sheet of vinyl tape used to decorate painted area
B00BLZAW56|5|Nice additional to my VW bug!
B00E5PYUXE|4|12 passenger van and the seat belts get tight. These allow the passengers to adjust the tension for more comfort without compromising safety.
B00HNHWM4A|4|Everything was decent except the headlight adjuster they kept popping out on one of the lights but a dab of superglue fixed it
B00REMNB1W|5|I saw this on a truck in town. I just had to get it for mine!! Two for me and 3 for friends!! EXCELLENT!
B00IMNI50Y|4|Shipped quickly. Fits like stock.
B00390TK0Y|5|Nice piece .I bought four of the caps to cap off the NFab step bars I bought for my Ford . Solid quality , nice finish .
B004J6MCTI|5|OEM stuff, fit with no issues on my brother's wife's H3.
B0006H8ACW|5|Fit my factory S-10 mirrors perfectly, looked just like original equipment. Really made a big difference in towing a tent trailer. Without these I would have been blind behind me. Very happy with them and would highly recommend for anyone towing a wide trailer.
B00R71JRFO|4|somewhat difficult to snap back together.Keeps popping apart.
B0069TND14|3|Look great very fast shipping but some LEDs burnt out within minutes
B00NPZAZ1G|5|Item was exact replacement, shipping was great and the price was right. Thanks, Bill
B000HZDFVY|5|Installed as expected. Worked great. No complaints.
B000C5DUN2|5|Work great. The faces had crumbed off the original switches, though the buttons underneath still worked. Install was simply and straightforward. Fit great, look great. Being factory parts, they should.  Hard part was unplugging the harness from the new switches (I reused the old harness, replacing it requires more work) Installed in 1997 Explorer which actually calls for the 5919 switches. The 5919 is inexplicably $65 more expensive. (I believe the only difference is the color, blue vs green)
B00IOU1BPQ|5|Increased gas mileage and noticeable acceleration improvement.  Could be quieter; how about a retrofit sound deadening kit.
B00POG2SIM|5|Love these!  They look nice on my big red truck!  I just wish people would quit stealing them off my tires!  Really?!
B004BT687U|5|JUST WHAT i NEEDED
B00JIEX722|5|Love these LED lights, use them for my running light in a '08 Scion tC and they are super bright and the perfect white color. I love these so much I'll be buying more for my license plate light next.
B000WJEXAM|5|Good fit for my scooter.
B002X6VXL4|4|Works great and hold a charge for along time
B007L6Q1EK|5|Its oil and it is slippery.
B00LFL8PDW|5|Perfect fit
B00515NHKY|5|Great power.  Happy with purchase.
B0002JMU3E|5|fixed my truck
B00IBOKPHK|5|These mats are a great fit for the Accord Coupe! I have had these mats for a month now and I am very happy with the purchase. People have asked about them when they ride in my car because they are impressed with how nice they look.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Great fit<br />-Sturdy construction and they seemed to be very high quality<br />-Texture on the surface makes them look classy<br />-Back-side has the same grippy, velcro-like texture that the factory mats have<br />-Use the factory mat lock points.<br />-Waterproof<br />-Easy to clean<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Large plastic 3D logos (1&#34; tall) on the mats detract from them visually (though they're not noticeable when you're sitting down since they're close to the edge of the seat).<br />-Installation can be difficult; there were a few kinks in the mat that were from them not sitting correctly the first time. Because of the grippy nature of the backing, it was hard to make small adjustments to the position of the mats.
B00O83OIAI|4|Good!
B00CJD10TQ|5|perfect.... watched a utube how to fix .... changed out all bulbs works great
B009UIV6K6|5|Love love love it!  It hangs from my rear view mirror and I love hearing it ring as I drive around.
B000PM96NA|5|Exact fit
B0023TQEFQ|4|Bought this just for the caps and it came really fast. I was going to put more freon into my moms suv 2004 Toyota Highlander v6. I was loosening the A/C low side service port and the cap blew off and disappeared. There was only two of them that only fitted, which in result I just used the blue cap and it fitted perfect.
B00D7HZ6FC|5|Great product! Very well made. Have since bought another one for several other pieces of equipment that I don't use all the time. When I go to fire them up the batteries are fresh as a new one. Like the fact that they hardly consume any power so I just leave them hooked up all the time when possible. I  highly recommend this product. Have a blessed day and God bless America!
B005RNEYAM|4|stuff worked pretty good not that hard to sand
B0091OE6K6|5|I've been using one of these for a couple months now and remain happy with it.  It hasn't popped apart, broken yet.  The ones I've gotten at Walmart are two pieces that snap together at the top and bottom.  They break easily, the snap pops apart and then won't remain snapped.  This one is connected at one end and you snap the other.  So far it's keeping connected.  This one could be a winner!
B001DKRG26|5|Exactly what I expected
B000CMJ08O|4|its longer than my coil
B00GHSIK1A|5|Perfect match and perfect fit. Works very well.
B00XM1NF42|5|I love the retro look! the size/quality actually surprised me. Great purchase
B00NB8UEWM|1|this kit came with 10 pcs i only got to use 3. its not worth it. save yourself some money and don't buy these
B008032N40|1|arrived broken due to shipping, very cheap and thin plastic, better of getting one at the junkyard
B007TZXW04|5|It was just like i expected
B00W8E010U|5|My vehicle is a 2005, so does not have a TPMS at all.  I ordered this because it was compact and could be integrated into my interior without being too bulky, yet provide the functionality I needed.  It doesnt matter what kind of car you have.  The sending units should fit into most standard wheels.  I have custom wheels and the installer had no problem.  Power the receiver unit and after you roll a few feet, the sending units start to transmit.  It was a very easy installation and it works as well as expected.  If you already have a TPMS, this probably wont work (unless its a Toyota)
B00C0XTFOW|5|Highly reflective and great quality sticker. The actual color was not in the description. But it is not quite white, slightly grey. Looks awesome on my helmet.
B00GD8OL62|4|Great look, closet thing you can get to HIDs / LEDs.<br /><br />My Install: 2015 Honda CRV-V size H11<br /><br />Pros:<br />These are by far much closer to an HID look than other brands I have tried in the past.<br />Color: diamond white with scattered hints of blue. Closer to a 5900k color.<br />Plug in play, same size and fit as original bulbs<br />Unlike other brands, the color has not shown any sign of burning off or fading<br />If you have LED daytime running lights, these will match them well. They also will work and not flicker if your daytime running lights use the same cable as your headlights.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Dim -  Compared to OEM standard halogens, these are about 15% less bright which may be an issue for some.<br />Price -  Compared to the cost of H11 LEDs, these are not wroth it, upgrade to LEDs if your wiring is compatible:<br /> [[ASIN:B00T8HPJNY Kensun&reg; New Technology All-in-One LED Headlight Conversion Kit (from HID or Halogen) - H4 (HB2) (9003) Dual-Beam - 40W 4000LM x2 - 2 Year Warranty]]<br /><br />Build quality:<br />They look exactly light OEMs with the difference being the dark blue tint.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Get these if you want a &#34;cooler&#34; light which matches an HID look. Be aware these will be a bit less bright as your OEM lights but still functional. If you do have to go with a halogen, these are for you as they do not burn off color over time.
B009FUF6DM|4|They dry very fast and easy but hard to wash off the dirt.
B00OO147EG|2|Up pipe flang warped it's blown three gaskets had to replace it.  The rest of the kit worked fine.  It does require some modification.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Used on my Honda Ruckus.  Easy install and works great.  Tucks and hides easily.
B004AIIVUO|5|Work wonderful
B00BZSE5CK|5|Great product, fast shipping love it!
B00BG3WX7I|5|Works perfectly, fixed my rough idle.<br /><br />Direct fit for my 2006 Chrysler 300 3.5l v6.
B006WYRXBM|1|Sizing chart was off quite a bit. I should have ordered it 2 sizes smaller.<br />The quality of the leather was ok but the laces were extremely long and would have to be cut down quite a bit.
B000C59W7U|5|Great Quality part and is very tight. I was pretty easy to install, the old one is pressed in a bit with the sleeve, you will need to use a ball joint separator and heavy 5lb + mallet to get it out, my old one was worn and was causing bad death wobble when going over big bumps, the new one cleared up most of the issues, but death wobble is caused by many worn parts! This one goes at the pitman arm and will help with steering slop a lot, if you feel like the jeep shifts to the right or left on a bump it is probably because of this worn part.
B009DJRX90|5|Excellent
B00OQP7YMM|5|Good!
B00LNGZ0PA|5|fit perfect. Quick delivery.
B003RQBKLC|4|Works great. Don't need the long cord, though.
B00JF8TGVC|5|Great
B008D8I63E|5|Awesome helmet. Lots of looks. Well made. It muffles sound of a loud exhaust pretty well. I usually wear medium helmets and I ordered this in medium and it fit perfectly snug
B00UEC87QS|1|They are literally plastic with double stick tape to attach to your grill. They didn't sit flush to the grill and the color was lighter than my black jeep so I returned them.
B00W1VHNKG|5|Great sizing! Great item!
B002Y2WIAC|5|I cracked the tail light lens of my 2012 F-250 and didn't much like the price Ford wanted for a replacement.  This unit is absolutely identical to the Ford original.
B01180541A|5|looks so much better than those soft white bulbs that came in car
B0026N8WIQ|4|ok
B00JIEX722|1|Didn't work as replacement for front parking lamps in 2005 Mercedes E500 (W211).  Error message appeared on dash display and lights flickered on about once every six seconds or so.
B007Z8VG30|4|just ok the pic does not relate to the actual size. Cuts could have been cleaner on the stickers
B00GOJ1FXM|4|quality belt !!!!!!
B001IB70LC|5|Thank you.
B000BPSW7C|5|It performs as advertised
B00H2TD5IQ|5|it solved a big problem for me.
B00IUUS0W2|4|Looks dope! Even better in person😏. Only gave it 4 stars cause it's not very gelie like it says, but such a awesome design
B00XVVED6C|5|fits Ducati Monster 696 nicely. You will need adapter plates, remember that.<br />Even though it says Rizoma, they're not. But, you can't beat that price. Rizoma's are $41/piece+..
B00EA0ZB7I|2|had to thread the holes on one light myself! it was just smooth with no threads at all! kinda poor mount bracket design as well. they are bright and they all worked but if I didn't have a tap and die set I could not have mounted them. you get what you pay for!
B00OZJB6AA|3|I expected better quality !
B004MZD4B6|4|For the money i had when buying it id say it was worth it. Got rid of my annoying turbo turkey gobble sound it had when letting off the throttle under high/heavy acceleration.  Still plan to get a wwII one day.
B008XIQ5KA|1|Multi tool arrived with broken scales. Haven't played much with plier thing, but I'm not gonna set the bar high. I mainly bought this for the utilikey, which was the biggest disappointment. Knife not remotely sharp, could not get bottle opener to work, and the eyeglass screw driver is too big which was the feature that sold me on this tool. Buy a DoohicKEY. It doesn't do as much, but actually does as it says.
B00PF5OXTE|3|If you break a mirror, there is no OEM replacement on just the mirror.  So this was my only option.<br /><br />The left mirror of the first pair I purchased had a blemish in it.  The price is to low to be worth my time sending back.  Second order was good for the look, however, the vertical hold needs a little improvement.  Bumping down the gravel roads of Iowa caused the mirror to slowly point downward.  I had to adjust a couple times during one outing.
B00GIJT9H2|2|You can't complain . But they are easily damaged.
B00L9NHYGK|3|My fuel efficiency has decreased on the 1st couple of fill ups. My sound is more crisp which gives the impression that I have more HP. The blue filter matches my car perfectly.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Good value for money, does the job !! Not too fancy but covers most of the front glass blocking the sun from damaging the interior and keeps the car relatively cool.
B00DJ4FOQ4|5|Great
B00J262R9A|3|This tuner works well but you simply cant get any phone support. I have left email messages and you can ask for a call back without loosing your place in the Que. Good luck with that!. I tried to load custom tunes from the computer to the hand held tuner. One loaded and the other did not. You can search the computer and find the tune. It is listed in the search field in the SCT program on the computer but it simply will not drop into the available field to be stored on the tuner. There is almost no way to get a hold of their customer service unless you can wait 50-80 minutes on hold! Great product with zero customer service and they simply don't care when you complain!
B00405EH64|1|Garbage. If you want a real oil catch can keep searching. Do not buy this brand.
B0095D34YM|5|Fits perfect
B000WLHGJA|5|saves my ML350 while I am in parking zoo (Brooklyn)
B00JMD4B9M|3|PROS:  the helmet itself is a good helmet with clever features as others have mentioned : sun visor, chin skirt, ventilation, etc.<br />CONS:  static in speakers, too much midrange, muffled microphone.  Gave me a headache after only 30 minutes of use.<br />Will be returning it.  Too bad, I really wanted to like it.
B000CGTLGQ|5|awesome at incredible price. stopping power is just double compared to any standard car maker rotor, pair with EBC red stuff brake pads. you will not be disappointed. this is the 2nd pair I buy in 5 years.
B002LGXOT0|5|Best GL1800 windshield I've tested.  I've tried 3 others over the past year.
B005JU5UEW|5|NOT CHEAP...BUT ALL WORTH IT!
B002FDM2NS|4|Great fit easy to use
B0041TQTZQ|5|fits and works flawlessly
B000CAINEI|5|Husband likes it ~ great coverage!
B0030453NM|5|Nice product
B006N91BLY|5|Bought this as a replacement for my w211. Fits perfectly functions as it should.
B00OTZ48FU|4|I like the product - I own the heat shield for 2 automobiles but the side window shade did not fit well.  I kept it because there was nothing else to order that would fit better from HeatShield.  All-in-all, HeatShield is an amazing product and works tremendously better than other car shades - just amazing!
B00FN3PO4Q|1|Did not fit tailgate
B00CLB2Y8W|4|Feel Sturdy and well made.  Fits correctly on the back seatbelts in a 2009 Honda FIT Sport.  You can use them on the front seats but the seat belt will not retract all the way when you unbuckle which can wear out your seat belt over time.
B00L81X6OM|5|Great fit and great look. Delivery was also as expected.
B002ZTGX3W|5|Worked well and easy to install on your own! Great Price!
B00MPDKYGU|5|Great product !
B0012INQG4|5|Wolo horns is a well-established manufacturer of vehicle and motorcycle horns that are good quality and quite loud. They also last. I anticipate this unit will function well for a long time attached to my boat. A suggestion: wherever you mount it try to angle the horn downward a few degrees so water and condensation doesn't flood it and prematurely kill it.
B00C7Z0BZ0|5|works perfect for my spouses bike.
B00NTOJU28|4|I bought a pair of these for my 2006 chevy. They are not as bright as I wanted. They are bright and put out a nice white color but I have an obsession with having the brightest light I can and this is not it. If you are looking for a bright light go with the JDM ASTAR Extremely Bright 48-EX Chipsets 569 578 211-2 212-2 1.72&#34; LED Bulbs, Xenon White. I ordered one of these just for the dome light and it blew the two other bulbs away in brightness. I will be returning these two bulbs and purchasing the 48-ex chipset bulbs to replace them
B00GBVHQB8|5|Fast shipping. My girl friend loves the gloves
B001UN78H4|2|Too big size, and there is a big logo on the right side not showing in the photo
B0006IX7TW|4|I works great, I'm not sure how long the batteries last over 3 months that I know. The only downer is no on off switch, you have to pop it open to stop it. May just use &#34;crummy&#34; batteries in it and let it just die instead? lol
B000F2OAW2|1|Even though their system stated it would fit my car, it did not.  I ordered another one for my Jeep and it doesn't fit either.
B0050EILKC|5|Great step; really worked well on our recent trip and purchase price was much lower than the other comp. brand.
B000GRZB42|5|Great value fit and sound  almost half the cost of other brands was totaly satisifed with this product
B00ZE5RGTY|5|I got this set for my sister who is expecting. Overall, I am very pleased with the set. It comes with 2 compartments that that slide in between the seats and arm rest. They work great for storage or catching things that fall in between the cracks. It also comes with a slip resistant pad for your dash, to hold your phone. The free &#34;baby on board&#34; sticker is a cute added bonus. This whole set is made really well. Nothing cheap about it at all. So, it's a really good deal.<br />This set is going to come in so handy for my sister.<br /><br />*I received this product for free or at a low discount. In exchange, I have given my honest review.<br /> With that being said, I want to stress that I give my honest opinion for products I receive.
B00NX8EYFI|5|looks good on my van
B000RZCVSC|5|not exactly what i thought it was .but service was great
B004OJL75A|3|6 out of the 8 plugs were out of the original plug boxes. Very poor packaging!  Plugs are good so far.  Inspect plugs before you install. Excellent one piece design. Get with it Motorcraft!
B00FSDBBPM|5|I made this purchase for my husband, who was upset because someone stole the Toyota emblem from his truck. When receiving the emblem my husband immediately took it and put it on. It matched perfectly!
B007Q1DQHK|4|Used this on my 2005 Chevy Silverado.  Worked great.  The only issue I had was that the holes for the screws were slightly off, so I had to finagle it a bit.  But I got it in with only a few minutes of work.
B00KSMFGY0|3|they came pink... not a huge deal just a little disappointed. the fit also was a tad out of tolerance
B00230IDAY|3|Same problem, spins in plastic when tightening
B00WAOSFIS|4|They held up fine and better than the last pair I bought. Just wish they touched or was closer between the doors. It's a gap about 1 1/2&#34; from the end of the drivers door and the beginning of the passenger door.
B002M2MMXM|4|It looks good but haven't install it yet.
B0002SQZQ8|5|worked very well, no problems on a first time install
B008F8QGLQ|5|Fit good. Worked like they should.
B011A08IA2|5|I bought one of these via AntennamastsRus and struggled at first to get it in. The tech people there (Zach) are fantastic! Buy from them for the assistance that they will give you via the phone to assist you until you have completed the task to satisfaction. Ours is now installed and working great! I bought a mast from them for my Lexus suv a few years ago and it is still working great. I would definitely recommend them- they know their product and they know what they are doing-not just a middleman distributor.<br />We own a 2004 Volvo S40 and the antenna had a smooth cable- no teeth. It made it more complicated to install but I am a 55yr old female who did it with the aid of the technical support they give. I had the poor fella on the phone for 10 minutes and called more than once.
B008HZGX6A|5|Great product that truly works. While no replacement for fuel filters, this additive works well at cleaning tanks and removing water and debris from mobile and stationary tanks. If its your first time using it, please follow directions for best results and have a spare filter on hand depending on how dirty the tank is.
B007LS2D6S|5|Fast shipping. Great product. After installation,  my car looks like new and I can see to drive at night again!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|great
B00KQ4VE64|5|Pricey for a filter, but as soon as you mention &#34;diesel&#34; prices go up anyways. Installed perfectly on my '15 RAM Ecodiesel. Note that it DOES NOT fit Jeep GC ecodiesels (why FCA didn't make them same is beyond me). It is a quality filter, though!
B000BUOSGG|5|Perfect in my camper sink!
B000BOAMUI|1|A waste of time and money (mostly time). Tried wrapping this around my tailpipe, but it doesn't adhere at all, so you can't get a good tight wrap, and if you pull on it too hard the threads start separating. Got it around my tailpipe (but it wasn't pretty), and wrapped some wire around it. Left the engine running on idle for 30+ minutes.....it hadn't even started to harden. Needless to say I pulled the entire mess off and I'm going back to using putty, which I've had great results with before.
B00EAOIRBQ|5|Came fast and was packaged well. Perfect fit and easy to install, I love the convenience and price. Will definitely purchase again.
B000BUQODG|4|Fit pretty well.
B001P29O5Y|4|Great bike rack.  My only wish is that I went with one that had folding down arms so I wouldn't have to remove the rack when driving around town with out the bikes.  But, that was my fault, not the product.
B00DD0CMU0|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B000QGOPO0|5|Easiest speaker install ever, 3 screws and a couple electrical connection.  Fit perfect like an OEM part should.  THANKS
B00F7S73C8|5|Sweet 'n clean!
B002HMD1C8|2|These goggles let in a lot of dust. We were on the ATV trails and they were very dusty. After 30 miles of riding I took the goggles off and I had dirt all around my eyes, not just around my mouth and cheeks like usual. The foam around the goggles is very thin and lets dust in. I looked like a racoon! I have Castle and 100% goggles and they do a better job of keeping the dust out. Do not buy these goggles unless you want dust in your eyes.
B009K4H42Y|5|Best price I could get.
B0072SAB9I|2|I put the sticker on my car and all the color has faded, so it is now white. Disappointed by that, but I did put the sticker on my laptop and the color has lasted just find.
B0084UK7MO|3|You will have some problem with windows closing after attaching it to you car if you have automatically closing windows.
B001CYG6XS|4|Works really well: easy to see in the car and stays true to the 4 directions.  It was easy to set the compensation for magnetic noise from the car and engine.  The only problem was that the double sided tape does not hold, so be prepared to use the two screws or a different attachment method.
B000O8455O|5|Great product,super fast shipping
B00BG3GFEU|5|This is worth the price. My husband and I put this in in about 20 mins! Super cold air!
B001HBSXUK|5|Works Great.
B00XBJDBCG|3|The threaded screw was difficult to turn and I had difficulty screwing it into the flywheel.
B00D8FUM8E|5|Good product and delivery
B009RG26V4|5|I'm 6'2 150 and the small/medium was a perfect fit for me, it was even a little big so keep in mind when buying the straps adjust so you could be smart and larger and the small/medium would still fit.
B007ANWAO4|5|Arrived early and was everything I needed...good quality and service
B00EN9DOP2|5|My mini bike now runs like a top. and cheap too.
B004CGRPVA|5|Awesome, heavy duty tool.  Great construction.  Exactly what you need if the power steering pulley is stuck on a V6 Saturn with less than three inches of clearance from the frame.  Not quite out of the the box, though; however, all you need is a shorter bolt (M12-1.75 x 45 to 50mm), which you can find in any hardware store, and a thick, wide washer like the one at the top of shock absorbers so that the bolt is pushing against the pulley flange and not the pump shaft.  If you ever find yourself with a stuck on pulley and little room, try this tool first.  It is well worth the money.
B00GYTEBPQ|5|GREAT PRODUCT!
B000WPF9FY|5|Works great! AND it doesn't cost $80. Which is what the auto parts stores in my area wanted for the filter!  I'll be buying this again!
B00432S99U|5|Nice lights. I put them over my koi pond. They are really bright! Great proce too.
B000GZCPFM|5|They were a great fit for my car. The squeaking took about a week to stop so I was a little nervous at first, but now there is just smooth driving. I even got them @ a great price so I was extremely happy cause that squeaking was embarrassing.
B004QIMCDU|3|Not quite original but it works OK.  Wish it was true, but then it would cost more.
B00S4W1DL6|5|I used to get a brushburn on the side of my neck from the seat belt.  This works great.
B00EWIS1XO|5|Love them I just did not like that they were folded
B00OZSLZBG|5|It worked perfectly!!!
B0000C6F6L|5|Fit perfect works great fast delivery!
B00AF67MSC|1|The remote did nothing. It wouldn't change colors, just all colors at once. Wouldn't recommend it
B00AR9F5HC|5|I ordered two stickers, one from this seller and the other from another different one and i can honestly say by far this sticker is the best one you guys really went beyond customer service, and let me tell you why , this came in on time and once you open it you receive a set of instructions and everything , let alone the service is great and the sticker as well looks amazing better than the other one I bought from the other guys,honestly looks professionally made and not cheap great for just about 3$ good job 👍
B004I9XYIE|5|works great
B0013IR88A|5|Worked perfect in the RV!  Very happy with it.  I have the same size electric crock pot at home and it is perfect for 2 to 3 servings.
B0009IR0PQ|5|I bought a new microfiber couch and learned the hard way that water spots are not fixable with standard cleaners. This stuff worked perfectly!!!!
B0012FKF9S|5|Bought these so I can attach a mesh tarp to my awning.  The little plastic tubes need to be glued in, so the don't slip out inside the awning track.  Simple and works great.
B00NFSNAS8|4|had good reviews, seems to be well built,haven't used it yet
B000CMHVJO|4|Works good was more difficult to install than advertised the template wan not specific.
B00B9H3WDK|5|Fit perfectly and works as advertised.
B00IZ0XU9K|4|Good
B00GX2PSOW|5|Great
B000CIT3N0|3|Good
B00HVHA0EG|5|Worked very well ; did have to use some duct tape on key and plastic case 1st ,, but rubber cover on top works and looks great .
B00QJN7JYC|1|could have got these tires for $79 rocky mountain $45 less
B00NT8H62U|5|This works perfectly for being able to use the AUX on your CD220 radio. I attached an iClever Himbox HB01 Bluetooth car kit to the AUX cable and voila! I now have a hands free phone as well as Bluetooth wireless music through my iPhone on my 16 year old car. Love it!
B00AU9V8WU|5|This fits the 2014 FJ Cruiser just fine. Install was a snap. Took me about 10 minutes to get it all done. Of course, having the proper tools helps!
B00EOZQHQS|5|awesome product  would recomend
B00NB845EK|3|The only problem I ran into was the cover to the middle cushoined compartment. Mine opens from the side and the cover was made to open from the front. Very disappointed. The picture displayed the inside of a cab interior & was exactly the same as mine.  They wouldn't except my return request.
B00JVHLS3G|1|The white sections of the symbol are yellow after one month use. My car is garaged most of the time. The bezel is not the same as a BMW bezel. Don't waste your resources on this product.
B004P22CJ6|5|Perfect fit
B000BW8U7C|5|Perfect fit for Mallory small block Chevy marine distributor
B00KTHXXTE|5|Fit perfectly. After replacing the battery it's like I've got a brand new fob!
B002YKIJ8O|5|Works great for plugging things into other things!
B00BCP9A62|5|As a retired corrections officer, you won't get a negative review on this item. I served the CONNECTICUT DEPT OF CORRECTION, I served with pride and gave my very best for the public safety concerns. Love the stickers and purchased another set of stickers
B00J5IOSP6|5|Fit perfectly. Delivered to me very quickly.
B00MVMMIA0|5|I bought this one because the reviews for other wedge 921 LED bulbs said they weren't as bright as the incandescents they replaced. This one was actually too bright for my liking but I give it 5 stars because it is what it says it is. It was brighter than the incandescents that I replaced it with in my camper. So I am now looking for a less bright LED bulb. Also I did like the warmness of this bulb, it was not blue or too white.
B00QMWQJRS|2|Too small and slide around floor board..........
B003YMBO2E|5|Very nice. Easy to install, it gives a nice look in any view.
B0006GF5SK|4|Quick, easy, and does the job.
B001EP0HGC|1|Excellent mount. Shipment was quick,...we immediately used it. c.w. moran, jr
B000Y87SN0|5|Great product gets the job done!!!
B002MQSBEC|5|Great!
B0024FOTOW|4|The device works as specified and it does make loading my canoe on our SUV much easier. You still need a car with a trailer hitch to use this devise and you will need to purchase a ball mount unless you already have one. I removed the ball from my mount since I do not tow very often. The only negative is the assembly is kind of wobbly when mounted to the car. Once loaded I lower the top support so the canoe rest on my car and not the canoe loader and then raise it when I'm ready to unload the canoe.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Excellent product and great seller to work with!
B000C2WF9A|5|This cap actually works. Tight fit for my Jeep, no leaks or engine codes.
B007P14NPU|1|Not a V2.0. WEill not work for Dash Command, or OBDII adapters. Recieved from China directly, if troubles very hard to return for full refund. Stay away.
B00WQHHJAY|5|Great decal. Very easy to apply and really durable.
B004Y4R1XC|5|great visibility, great price.
B00DQU9W4G|3|My fiance and I were looking for car covers that were good in price and of quality material. I feel that these covers were exactly what we were looking for. They fit our cars perfectly and the little lock each comes with keeps the car cover secure. The car cover itself protects against the desert heat we live in along with protecting from the dirt. I have had a few family members inquire about where we purchased the covers and they were surprised that we did not pay more than $50 each for them.<br /><br />Update: For the first few months these were perfect, but as the wind picked up in late October the car covers started to tear.
B000QFVJ5O|5|Very well made, longer than the stock tire spoons that came with my BMW motorcycle tool kit.  A bit too long to fit in tool tray but they fit nicely underneath the fuel tank inside the tubeular frame on my BMW R80RT
B00569N46M|5|Just as promised.
B004BACSYG|5|perfect 07 gti
B00CPYFOW8|5|Worked like a charm. Exactly what I was looking for.
B0078U83CM|5|Fit my 31 spline explorer 8.8 perfectly, also matched what came out exactly.  Note this bearing is now marked Koyo, because they own Torrington.  This is high quality.
B00N0GLT6A|5|Came very quickly and easy to install
B000VU91SG|5|Heavy duty and fits great.
B005OXEL8K|4|one of the pins was pushed in so a light did not work at first. but i was able to pull the pin out with pliers and it worked.
B00LL4ATTG|3|They fit my 05 Vstar 100 forks perfect, however they do not fit the factory turn signals, so you will need signals with external wiring to make them work.
B00MN7EIJC|5|Great product and great quality will reccomend to others ... Just took about 2 1/2 weeks to receive. Overall great product and pricing.
B00QMZ8HCA|5|They work well in a very tight space between the driver (and passenger) front seats and the arm rest of my Nissan Leaf.  My husband's phone kept dropping off his lap and into the black 'void' before purchasing these. Now he uses them as a phone holder automatically. Also caught my earring when the back fell off.  Thank you! I would probably still be digging for it otherwise.
B008FOVNEA|4|Good sticker.
B00LN3V1O2|5|as expected
B000BZEJCY|5|Great OE replacements on my dad's 69 F100 with a 5.0 conversion we did.
B00I8VA3MS|1|IT was the wrong part. It does not fit a 55 hp Johnson outboard. I called SEI and they were about clueless. Disappointed.
B00F7GXNX8|5|Everything was perfect. Thank you so much for fast shipping!! Perfect!!!
B00F9DYTR8|5|Bright and just overall awesome light
B00NAUL218|5|Installed these on my boat trailer.  They are plenty bright without being obnoxious and were easy to install.  I have not put to boat in the water yet with them on, so I can't say if they are waterproof.  But I am told they are.
B00USUDU4K|4|Very good product. Easy to install
B00NB8TGVW|5|These LED's are amazing. Super bright and improve interior lighting 100%. I'd absolutely recommend these to anyone and would buy again if I got a different truck.
B000JZZT7K|5|Works great and easy installation.  You will need a gasket if the old one came off.  You may also need the exhaust bolt and spring kit if yours is old.  This was installed on a 1999 Honda Civic LX Sedan.
B0018L60B8|5|A Super Deal!!!
B00DSD63KC|5|Loved it
B000WK4EC8|5|REALLY CLEANS THE HARD TO REACH SPOTS.
B00E9G1F0K|5|Worked great and exactly like the one that failed.  I expected to pay far more and would have at a marine shop
B000E28MTA|5|Great product. Excellent value.
B00KOM1RSI|5|Great item, will recommend highly.
B000CJ1ZOO|4|this fit well and looks good. the installation took just a few mitutes. I'm getting another pair for my other truck
B000C39C40|2|it wobbled ,had to straighten it before i could use it ..not heavy enough.
B00I8OMWQ0|5|Really great stuff, went on well and easy to install.
B00HF40N06|4|good parts cleaner, works nice
B00P64H6LG|5|100% in love with these th at could be a bit brighter but other then that! Bang for your buck!.. no water damage rediculously easy install!
B003V57NUQ|4|Very good product for the money. If I had to pick on something, I would say the foam is very cheap and rips easily.  I wrapped all the foam with vinyl tape as soon as the first one ripped.
B00CJ0FLN0|5|Easy to install, fast delivery
B002OQ1V8I|5|Best grips that I have ever used.  Super comfortable!
B000CIC0CQ|5|Cadillac keychain was a gift for my son who just bought his first Cadillac.  He loves it and is using it every day.
B004VLD196|5|installed it few weeks ago on Infiniti g35 and so far ride quality is great and no more clunking.
B000GVANDC|5|Very nice and easy to install. Came on time and very well packed.<br />sound is deep and kick@$$.
B0015KOF78|5|Perfect fit.
B00IVPA9NY|5|Bought a couple of different styles of motorcycle gloves for my husband, who has very large hands. We were having a problem finding a pair to fit him in the stores as most only carried up to a 2x. These were pretty true to size, especially when we compared them to the 'Vance Leather VL452-3XL - Motorcycle Summer Mesh Gloves - 3X-Large' we purchased at the same time. (The Vance ones were a LOT smaller in size.) These fit much better and we will be keeping these for him to use for riding!
B00R6RQ0DQ|5|Worked perfectly!
B000Q6UBQ6|5|This stuff is awesome!!!! First time using it, make sure to use a paint suit and head sock, I got a lot on my hair... It's very messy because of the gun ($20 Amazon gun)... But it's nice, did all my underbody and rear wheel Wales.
B00BJON7QU|5|Love them
B000ALBS0K|5|Two years now, and it is still working fine.
B000OQMIZU|5|they are okay they are built decent as long as you don't go crazy with them
B005GL4GVM|4|I'm on my second truck with a bakflip. The f1 is worth the extra $
B005FR443C|2|Too small for my use, didn't realize until I had the box open which disintegrated as soon as the wrapping was taken off.  The installation instructions are extremely lacking and not really very instructive.  I'm sure a mechanic could install it without issue, but it's for &#34;towing 2500 lbs&#34; which is half of our tow weight.
B0082NET5E|5|whovarian. nuff said
B0007Y6MCO|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B000WJ64O0|5|I love this... Made the steering wheel a lot more comfortable and it looks and fits great
B00MMQRK4O|5|I love it, it looks just like the picture. It's easy to install and I looks great on my 2007 cobalt.
B0024E6W02|5|Goooooooz
B00HM98FGS|5|makes truck shine again, delivered on time, happy
B0073JRZ1S|5|great
B000C4086U|5|cant wait to try it out.
B007IKN17O|5|Installed on kandi 110cc buggy very easily started right up
B00N3VYMJ8|5|smooth action and easy install
B00EPJFLWO|5|Easy to install. Wish I would have purchased a higher wattage kit but they are brighter than the stock bulbs.
B00VNBDVOC|5|Amazing packing, quality looks great!. Well, I need to replace them, but OPT7, responds immediately to fix this situation
B004P23X6W|1|This was a terrible purchase. First a part was defective. Then customer support at Bestop would not honor the replacement due to not receiving a verification of order. All they had to do is ask Amazon. Then another part had a crack in the plastic end of a bow. The look is good but I will never order a Bestop product again!!
B00267APNM|5|Fit my 99 Silverado perfectly. Quick install. Works great
B0012TZ1RU|5|Worked as advertised, exactly what I ordered.
B000RZR2W2|5|Really nice product , works great
B000GD5FMY|5|better than the big $ ones
B004304C0W|1|flimsy
B00F9RNIPI|5|Great product and fast shipping. Cable long enough and strong to jump.
B00EOX2QJC|3|Good quality, but not deep enough for the 6 volt battery I got at Costco, which I am sure is not a Group 24, but who has time to research stuff like that anyways. I still use it, but the top doesn't seat completely down.
B005XUYDV4|5|this coil pack is great, it works as good as any out there
B00KLZ65GM|5|Cool, comfy.
B00B5OB7O8|5|They worked great, really bright and totally worth the money
B0009IQZH0|4|It does seem to work well but leaves lint. I've washed it a few times in the washer/dryer but it will still leave lint if using to wipe the glass areas of my car and my dash. Not sure why so much lint comes off these towels.
B00KL27PQO|3|Nice quality, but pretty sure I could have bought the  same quality for half the price at Walmart
B000IMG6O4|5|I never knew stabbing a wire could be so effortless!
B0031HZS6A|5|I installed this on my 2004 Ford Taurus about a month ago and it started right up like a champ! I will keep you updated if anything changes. So far I am very pleased. The item works extremely well, it had good directions, and came extremely well packaged! I bought this for about $70 on amazon and compared to almost $200 at an auto parts store, I would rather take the half an hour to replace this thing three more times for the price of one at retail price than to take my chances with only one from an auto part store. The main problem with these is that they were designed to fail. They are right underneath the oil filter so they get full of oil every oil change, corrode, and quit working. If I have to buy one and replace it in four years, its not because its a bad product, its because Ford cannot design engines well. The fact that it came with roadside assistance and a 2 year warranty is a HUGE plus! Would buy again!
B00LFPLW88|5|Perfect
B00QSLNG06|3|The bulb seems to be quality construction and is bright enough.  However, it did not properly work in my 2013 Nissan Rogue, which Amazon listed as compatible.  The bulb fits in the socket, but my fuse blew, in particular a fuse in the engine compartment that controlled the running lights and license plate light.  The 7443 bulb has two different types of socket designs:  CK and Standard.  The difference is which of the four wires are positive/negative.  You can search on Youtube on how to test.  I believe these bulbs are for Standard sockets.  The package contains a warning: For Off-Road or Show Use Only.  In other words, these bulbs are not DOT approved; &#34;legal&#34; for use on the street.  You could get ticket by an overly zealous police officer.  I had hoped to replace my brake lights, so that I would not have to worry about changing them for the life of the vehicle.  Such is not the case.  I also tried using these in my turnsignal light; it worked, but the light blinked at double the normal rate; it would require a resistor to function properly.  I reinstalled the original bulbs and am returning these LED's to Amazon.  Seems like a good product, wish it fit my vehicle.

B000CITK8S|5|On replacing my mower battery for the second time, the employee at the auto parts store said lead acid batteries would last much longer if I would install this Battery Tender, so I bought one. I don't know if it extends battery life as it has been installed less than a year. However, it is nice to hear the engine spin so well after several months of the mower sitting unused.<br /><br />As I have a car that is seldom used, I decided to order a second Battery Tender Junior. The Tender has adequate power to bring to bring this larger battery back to full charge after the car is driven, it just takes longer than with the mower battery. Don't know if it has enough capacity to bring the car battery to full charge if it is really discharged?<br /><br />I will update this review after I've had enough experience with the Battery Tender Junior to determine if it really extends battery life. Already they are worth the investment just to have the batteries always at full charge.

B0024E6ZW2|5|I bought two of these for our RV steps and they are fantastic!  No more concern about stepping up and down the stairs and worrying about whether the steps will come loose (I'd read somewhere that the awning and steps on an RV are the &#34;first to go&#34; in terms of repairs).  Even Jack, our 80 lb. Labrador retriever, loves stepping up and down the steps now--no hesitation because they make the steps completely sturdy. Easy to put up and take down. Great purchase, quick delivery; really good price.  We have a Class A motorhome.  Not sure whether the available heights work for 5th wheels.
B00471T798|5|Very well made and arrived quickly from China.  For the price,  you can't beat it.
B00JBI8UU4|1|Cheap crap<br /><br />UPDATE:  After barely a year, the LED assembly on the drivers side failed.  It had always been 'leaky' and whenever it rained or you washed the car it would fog up the headlight for a week.  After the LED faded away, I contacted the seller and they said (of course) no replacement after the year I owned it. I offered to buy just the drivers side headlight from them, but they will not provide that. Only sets.  So now I am stuck replacing BOTH headlights again (definitely from another seller) to avoid my car looking defective driving around town.  Wasted over $200.00<br /><br />Original post:<br /><br />I NEEDED to replace the original headlights on my 2001 BMW X5 4.4i E53, so for the price they are OK. First, I didn't know my car had HID (lowbeams only) so on the face of it THESE DO NOT FIT OR WORK on my car!  Yikes. Almost sent them back, but then realized that the lower portion of the body of the headlights would detach, so they fit perfect.  Next I uninstalled my HID ballast and saw that the 12v connector for the ballast fit perfect into the connector for this unit!  Viola!  Fit and worked! Next I had to splice the POS/NEG wires for the HALO and EYEBROW lights into the daytime running light/high-beam lead. Easy.  Now when I turn on the car the DRL will activate the HALO and EYEBROW LED in this new unit. When I turn to low-beam, they go off and low-beam only. Can't figure out a way to get that to power the LED's also. Then when I use high-beam, they ALL come on. Including pics here so you can see the result.<br /><br />BIG CON:  The HALO LED are VERY DIM and cannot be seen in daylight conditions (The eyebrow LED's seem better). Must be in a darkened area, or at night... in which case you are using the low-beams and they are off anyway!<br /><br />If the HALO lights were bright, I would love them. All in all, they look good in the car for a couple hundred buck replacement, and they can be made to work in a HID car.<br /><br />OTHER NOTE:  I tried a pair of high intensity LED H7 bulbs as low-beams and they immediately threw a CHECK LOW-BEAM error in the BMW.  Went back to halogens and it's fine now. Also I think I will order ultra white H1 halogen bulbs for the DRL/High-beams so they don't look as yellow as you see in the photos.y immediately threw a CHECK LOW-BEAM error in the BMW.  Went back to halogens and it's fine now. Also I think I will order ultra white H1 halogen bulbs for the DRL/High-beams so they don't look as yellow as you see in the photos.
B0065J3368|5|good for bad eyes
B0002NIJW6|5|fits good

B00BR1TO80|5|This thing is a miracle worker. It fills the 85psig tires up on my  fifth wheel, runs a 110 AC 30' fan and lights for three and half hours during a power failure and oh yea, it will start your dead car battery.
B001GPUZXK|5|Good quality product.  Plus since I put it on my auto Cubs won 15 of last 16 games.  Hope my Chicago Bears plate works as well this fall/winter.
B006O87SUC|5|Great product,installs easy and makes a sweet grumble sound..
B007Z4X3R6|1|Want a refund!
B000VKTUJG|5|Fits like a glove!
B00H6XPZN6|5|I have tried several different brands of sunshades with no luck until I found these. They definitely shade my little one from the sun. She has very light colored skin and it seemed impossible to shade her in the car. They are much better quality than I expected. I didn't have any problems with suction cups that others mentioned. They were a little smushed from shipping, but I just wet them a little before sticking to the window and they stay very well. I put both on the same window since my back windows are pretty big. I have no complaints! You must buy these!
B000ONZXPK|5|Good quality oil
B0012TWQUK|5|It came on time and it was as described.  My husband is happy with it and we are completely satisfied.  Thank you
B002X6VXL4|5|I had originally bought the [[ASIN:B001U04NCA Stanley J309 600 Peak Amp Jump Starter]] for my Audi A4, but I found after one use, it never again had enough cranking power to start the car. So I returned it for the Stanley 1000 Peak Amp Jump Starter. Even after 2 years of use, this unit starts my car immediately. The build quality is good, and it has survived traveling in my trunk over many trips. The compressor works well on both car and bicycle tires too. This unit has given me a lot of peace of mind when traveling in areas far from auto service; I would recommend it to everyone!
B0065KAH8Y|5|Worked well and fit well
B000CPJIQK|5|Great fittings. Made well, fit properly, not crooked or out of round, reasonably priced. Very dependable, easy to disassemble and reuse with no thread pulling or warping of the fittings. Would I buy this item again? Yes. Would I recommend this item to others? Yes.
B00ECHQIDK|5|Nice to have it right in front of me and it is also very attractive on the bike lots of compliments
B00S4EU4DC|3|Bought two of these to install on my Mercedes 300CE and really like them.  It's a straight forward install if you understand the wiring of your vehicle.  Adds a really cool effect.<br /><br />I would have given it 4 or 5 stars, but one of the two units had a short in the wires and the Red halo won't light.  To top it off I didn't get around to installing it until after the return / exchange period expired and that's when I found out the halo was defective.<br /><br />I'd recommend buying these to anyone who's interested, but test the unit as soon as you get it or you could get stuck with a defective unit.
B0000BYASB|4|The powder coat is coming off and its starting to rust but it works good otherwise!
B000C5WCTA|5|OE fit and worked great
B00MAWUNCG|1|After 2 days of use, one I the screws fell off and the plate is just swinging back and forth.  Save your money.
B007V8WBPQ|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00YEDMXPY|2|Installation was pretty easy.  Instructions a little hard to understand, especially the pairing part.  Bluetooth works fine.  I was able to makes calls and listen to music on my cell phone.  Intercom (the main reason I ordered) didn't work well at speeds above 20MPH.  Me and my buddy rides Honda Ruckus so we can't go over 45MPH.  Even at this slow speed there was static and we couldn't communicate.  It worked when we stopped at a light.  For some reason it works when one of us was stationary while the other was riding. This may be a good option for people riding with a partner.
B00LCBIWG0|5|ok
B0011TXCZ4|5|Worked great for me..
B001F0MHV4|5|Good price for a replacement strap. Fast delivery.
B008I2OZK8|3|okay for temporary cover up
B00B84NW1G|5|Best in the business.
B00D96TWC4|4|Nice item just be careful with it as it is plastic and seems a lil flimsy.
B004BWU8H8|5|I really like having this secure storage area.  Installation was a little difficult ONLY because the it is VERY difficult to loosen the bolts that fasten the seat frame to the tub.  Best bet is an impact wrench- which I did not have.  Also note that one of the mounting &#34;ears&#34; goes UNDER 1 seat frame leg & the other ear goes OVER the other seat frame leg.<br /><br />I did use some spray on glue to adhere the supplied &#34;carpet&#34; inside the drawer & that works great.  Also, I don't have carpet in my JK, so I glued some rubber mat-like material under the storage container so I wouldn't have (& wouldn't hear) metal to metal contact where the container meets the tub of the Jeep.<br /><br />Before buying the unit, I read some negative feedback about the lock itself & the drawer slides, but I have not had any of those issues. Works great for me.<br /><br />Finally, I store a medium size handgun (which fits fine) in the drawer & sometimes also throw a wallet in there.  Always enough room inside for what I use it for.
B00AYA3Q0M|5|got them used and at a great price... packaged in original box and looked brand new.  I got them cheaper from Amazon then I could have found used locally....<br /><br />very happy with this purchase and with the product overall.... it fits perfect and fells less like plastic and more like rubber.
B005J88GTU|5|Fast shipping great product I recommend
B00W8DBZQU|5|Perfect, fit, looks and price.  Quick delivery, look, fit and work as well as the weathertech product.
B00BFZK66M|5|Enhances the life of the motor. In my bmw 320i 2k year works very well.
B002ZBWKAU|5|ABSOLUTE LIFE SAVER!!!!<br />Ok, I don't usually say this, but if you are a human being and own or lease or use a wheeled motor vehicle then I don't understand why you don't have this inside your vehicle.<br />We live in times where the street can be really rough, and thanks to global warming a lot of climatic changes, which directly affects the pressure on your tires. You can't even trust people at gas stations to pump your tires to your needed capacity, or even the inaccurate inflator readers they have in there. Don't think twice, it's alright mama, this is an absolute bang for the buck. It will last for years and help you in the most desperate situations, when on a trip, on the freeway or at home if you want to extend the lifespan of your tires you need to keep them at the optimal air pressure all the time, and check them regularly (I do mine twice a month).<br />It is even equipped with a flashlight in case of darkness.<br />This little toy will pump your tires in just minutes and save you from the worst emergencies. Just imagine you need to use the spare tire but it has no air pressure for being stored for years in the back of your car. I am not joking get this tool now before you are caught unprepared.
B000JUZJUM|5|Very quick fast shipping, installed have my car running again.
B00UEMH5L6|3|The adhesive is not that great.  I cleaned the grille, twice, and made sure it was dry before I installed the mesh grille pieces.  I have a few of the inserts that did not fully adhere to the grille.  I am worried that they may fall off, eventually.
B005MAHC7W|4|For my wife, they did the job.
B000WNOFY2|5|It was on time and the part I needed.  Thanks
B00O83KFYQ|5|Full factory plug-compatible fit.  Headlight bulbs included.  No splicing - simply plug the halo/CFL harness into the DRL light socket.
B00KQ0VMLK|5|these decals are great for my profession. I put these on my personal vehicle because I'm a volunteer firefighter/medic. these decals are not only made with such great quality but are also highly visible at night you can see them from 800 ft in the dark. they are also very visible during the day. and the detail is phenomenal. the adhesive is so strong that if you remove it, it comes apart and sticks like super glue
B009PQYNE4|5|no problems at all and quick shipping
B00027H0QI|5|Perfect replacement fit.  I have twin 5.7 Mercruiser inboards on my SeaRay, and I swap out the impellers once a season.  Easy job once you get the hang of it, and cheap insurance!  Carry a spare or two.
B003TUNRGM|5|I used fatMat on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler 2 door. It's a great product, easy to install and it WORKS. Road noise is greatly reduced and my stereo sounds so much better. The price is way cheaper than Dinomat and does just as good a job.
B00F4PB8LQ|5|Great stuff! It really works.
B00K7VE2VK|4|I am an auto enthusiast and have been detailing vehicles for years. I used this product on my car for a few months while living in an apartment complex. It works well for removing dust, bird droppings, bugs, and oils left behind from wet drives on dirty roads. However, I have found new micro-scratches in my paint after several uses. It is not severe, but the scratches are noticeable at an angle in the sunlight.<br /><br />I always followed the instructions, applied the product liberally, and used a clean side of a high quality 70% polyester, 30% polymide microfiber towel. I never used this product to clean mud/rocks off the vehicle. I put forth my best efforts not to cause any micro-scratches to the paint, but that seems to be an impossible feat without a proper two-bucket wash. I will praise this product for minimizing the amount of scratches applied to the paint when cleaning.<br /><br />This product does not feel as slick as the off-the-shelf detailers that you can buy in stores. Furthermore, this product does not lubricate well enough to use with a clay bar (at least not with the water mixture that is recommended).<br /><br />You may save water by not rinsing your car with a hose. However, to PROPERLY use this product, you will be washing between 5 and 10 towels when your done opposed to only one or two when using the two-bucket method. That costs water AND towels, because towels don't last forever.<br /><br />My advice for using this product is to apply it very, very liberally. Get your microfiber-towel soaking wet before touching the paint, and use a dry, clean microfiber to clean up the streaks left behind after all of the dirt is removed. Always use a clean side of a towel. Washing a coupe-sized vehicle will take at least five towels. Don't worry about the cost of using so much product. It is cheaper to use a bunch of waterless-wash than to polish the micro-scratches out later.
B00BRN5XV0|5|Works great on my Jeep Liberty, I added some hooks in the middle and have it setup in an L shape between the back seats latch and the four anchors on the trunk floor.
B0087NAWYQ|4|good missing few things
B00JA3BMDW|5|Good
B008OK0OIG|3|As advertised
B0074E2IKA|5|Well worth the asking price (I paid $11 shipped) high quality materials doesn't feel cheap, sure to make that Volkswagen lover smile.
B00AGLO9FU|5|Great
B00EEAFRL4|5|This is a premium Vortex 520 chain and sprocket kit. With steel sprockets and a chain strength of 8500 it should last a good long time.
B00LKXVCDU|5|It fits snug. will order one size bigger next time around
B001AIZ5HY|5|This is a good product that I recommend for removing that ugly toenail fungus that headlights get over time. This kit will work very well for most people. If your lens is smooth with no protrusions then this is a no brainer. It does a great job of removing years of discoloration with a minimal amount of effort. If your lens has protrusions you might want to consider the kit that does not have the drill attachment. Doing it by hand might easier if your lens is not totally flush. My lens only had a couple of protrusions but but I was able to work around it with a little effort. I think that most people will like this kit from 3M. Don't rush the sanding portion of the job and you will be happy with the results.
B00OO886EG|5|Great fit!! What I was looking for
B00GA393JU|4|It is a slick, nice looking windscreen that fits the overall appearance of the motorcycle. However, the fastening device makes it possible to vibrate at certain RPM-s, which is annoying, but I can live with. The finish on top of the screen is very rough, it is not to the standard that my son and I have accustomed (We have 2 other Puig screens that are much nicely done), and we are thinking to correct it with some sanding and polishing.
B00T1CT0GI|5|Great sound...just what I needed
B00KTIAREM|5|Works perfect. Would buy again
B009TWHCLA|5|Yes I was please with this item !!

9539751047|5|Great for covering scratches on your car bumper!
B0015PTTTW|5|My husband bought these for his Dodge Ram and they fit perfect! They look sleek, not cheap, and he was very pleased with them. He installed them himself without any issues. Took him maybe 30 minutes. Great buy!
B00651C8HG|5|I never usually write reviews, but this antenna is really nice and feel it deserved it. Installation literally  took 3 mins and was not hard at all. The antenna feels pretty sturdy and doesn't seem like it would fall off. Per other reviews, the antenna does bend at highway speeds, but immediately shifts back to its original form so this is not a problem. Now my escape looks a little more aggressive and the antenna gives it the off-road feel. Very pleased with the product.<br /><br />Fit perfect on my 2008 Ford Escape xlt for reference.
B006ONRYWO|5|Easy to install. Work great even on hard trails!
B00P5YMY5A|5|fit my jag x-type
B00TUMGO8G|5|Every led was working.
B0077T23IO|5|Easy to assemble and easier to use! I was without the use of my right arm yet was able to lift the bike off it's tires with ease. Is recommend to anyone.
B00JIAGA4S|3|Headlights look nice. The port for the side turn signal bulb didn't fit correctly. There was an excess of black plastic that stopped the socket fixture from being able to be pushed and turned to lock in. I opted to trim the plastic myself with a drill but would have returned if I didn't have that option. I ordered the headlights with Amber reflector and black housing and clarified with seller that this model doesn't come with bulbs.
B00LP436LA|4|Good quality, friendly customer service.
B0009IBJAS|5|I have used this product to recharge two atv batteries. It work great
B007L6ILBQ|3|Wanted it to go on the inside of my car.
B009TKMTXI|5|Perfect replacement in my 2011 fusion.  Easy install if you are small enough to get under the dash...  I wasn't so I walked my wife through the process, she did just fine.
B00ODJ3DBC|5|Works just like the old one.
B0057NSC6Y|3|Well this more of a personal preference. The constuction seems great and went on easy. But the sound is more than I wanted.
B0002JMEQW|4|Simple to use and did the trick, wish I had purchased it years ago.
B008KKMQZY|5|exact fit high quality brake pad
B00NFJWXYO|5|Great
B000GZICXQ|4|Replaced the rubber clutch line on my Superhawk. The Galfer line fit perfectly. A little tip for replacing the clutch line; get a rubber band or something to hold the clutch lever in while you remove the old rubber line. This will prevent the  fluid  from draining out of the master cylinder making it easier to bleed the air out  of the system after you install the new line.
B00JTXKDGA|1|This is not the correct rotor for 2010 528i BMW. I ordered this 2 weeks ago and the size was way bigger then original one. When i called &#34;Prime Choice&#34; they said thats what we have if its didn't fit on your car we can't do anything. So unprofessional, I returned it already. SEE ATTACHED PICS AS A PROOF. DON'T BUY. This will never fit in your BMW.
B0041TS6UM|3|If you are replacing an original part with this keep in mind you can't use the original painted cover. It is not identical.

B00C7Y8LGW|5|Fast shipping, perfect fit
B000BZJP64|4|As expected from a Bosch product, it works perfectly and it is a perfect fit for an Explorer Limited year 2000.  Keeping one star short because I thought it was a little bit misleading when Amazon offers Prime shipping but the small print explains it takes two to three weeks to ship, less than ideal when talking about replacement parts.

B00P8ZAR6E|5|I put this on my 82 jeep cj8 with a 305 chevy and it is great for driving on and off road I love it is very bright it makes it easy to see all the pot holes in the road and its easy to install and there are no problems with it and i have hit a lot of bumps and i have shot off of it once and it hasn't failed to turn on yet also it doesn't get hot and it doesn't take a lot of power it takes a hole lot less power than my headlights.One thing is that mine didn't come with the mounting hardware in the pic but the ones that came with it were still very good.
B000WJYMMQ|5|Mounted on handle bar and it works fine. I did replace the screws with ones i could take out if necessary.  Its basically a deterant ( bad spelling)  but does the job 4 me...
B00YZJ3FCC|2|sun shade was too small for the window of my F150 truck, the steering wheel cover did not fit over my 15.5 steering wheel. and the red biohazard symbol head rest covers did not completely over the head rests. right now I am hanging onto this set because this is the only one out right now to go into the zombie theme with my truck. may have to adjust and add material to sun shade. not worth the $80 for the kit but like I said the only one I found right now. not sure how long it will last it seems like the decals was ironed on?
B008HZOSTY|5|Expected as requested.
B000BQW5LK|5|It does the job it was made to do without complaint from me.
B002KRBW62|2|The picture shows that it would include the bearings, seals, and washers as well as the hollow spacer tube that the bolt goes through. My kit did not come with the spacer tube, which i need. Now i either need to buy another kit or fabricate my own somehow. I attached a picture to show what you will actually get with this kit, like the original seller should have done. 2 bearings, 2 seals, and 2 metal caps, that's all.
