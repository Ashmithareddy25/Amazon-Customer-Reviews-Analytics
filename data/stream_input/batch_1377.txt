B004RLEBTY|5.0|The boys of Red Fang MURDER the music scene with their major label sophomore release, \\"Murder the Mountains.\\"  Each and every song on the record will transport you to rock heaven.  I saw these guys twice in 2011, once in a gravel parking lot in Virginia and again at the 9:30 club opening up for Mastodon; Red Fang was the best act at each show, and the crowd showed it.  This album is the best introduction to the stoner/sludge genre of metal and rock out there today.  I have recruited many a fan by playing this record.  Please Fang, never break up - be a constant.
B004S82OAE|1.0|I am downright surprised at all the positive reviews this book has been receiving. Having several other certs under my belt I expected studying to be quite easy for this. However out all the books I have regretted purchasing for studying a cert,this one take the prize as the worst by a mile.<br /><br />The Organization in this book is greatly lacking. Quite often the author will throw unfamiliar terms to the reader and will say to look at a later chapter for more information on the term. This would not be so bad If the reader had a glossary to work with.<br /><br />Dry does not begin to even describe this book. Lammle not only makes the lessons bland, but confusing often being vague with his writing as well unnecessarily complicated. Let me try to demonstrate Lammle's writing style here. A normal person could say if you have two coins and I gave you two more coins, you would have four coins. We call that addition. Lammle will tell you the sum of the two coins added with  another set of coins will produce four coins by means of addition. He will assume you understand \\"another set\\" automatically means two even though another set could potentially mean any other possible number and if that is not confusing enough, he will only explain several chapters later. He just wants you to roll with it in the ealier chapters while he is trying to teach you other stuff and expecting you to understand how this works in another context.<br /><br />I Hated this book. Hated it. Hated hated hated it. Heated it.
B00402FGEE|5.0|An amazing accomplishment by all involved!  Better portrayals of women, a better exploration into competing forms of government, better initial casting, Robert Carlyle, superior graphics, and toned down sci-fi campiness.  A major difference from it's SG predecessors.  It was cancelled for gross incompetance of studio executives.  The production crew and cast of SGU did a better job at a contemporary story-telling paradigm than LOST or Battlestar.  The studio had a 1000 carrat diamond in hand and threw it into the garbage, way to go mororns.  Thanks for nothing!

1451683405|5.0|Free Will by Sam Harris<br /><br />\\"Free Will\\" is the persuasive essay that makes the compelling case that free will is an illusion.  Free will is intuitively understood but a difficult concept to master.  Dr. Harris systematically, and with few precise words destroys the notion of the concept of free will.  With a degree in philosophy and a doctorate degree in neuroscience and the innate ability to convey difficult concepts to the layperson, Dr. Harris is best suited to enlighten us on such a challenging topic.  This 96-page book is composed of the following eight chapters:  1. The Unconscious Origins of the Will, 2. Changing the Subject, 3. Cause and Effect, 4. Choices, Efforts, Intentions, 5. Might the Truth Be Bad for Us?, 6. Moral Responsibility, 7. Politics, and 8. Conclusion.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Fascinating topic in the hands of a great thinker.<br />2. Profound without being unintelligible.  Elegant and accessible prose.<br />3. Does a great job of dissecting free will.  The author systematically beaks down the concept of free will by attacking it from various angles.<br />4. More so than his previous great essay \\"Lying\\" he makes more use of his scientific background.  He relays studies that support his arguments.<br />5. The illusion of being in control is a concept that Dr. Harris masterfully destroys.<br />6. The author differentiates voluntary and involuntary actions.<br />7. Great quotes, \\"Our sense of free will results from a failure to understand this: We do not know what we intend to do until the intention itself arises\\".<br />8. A discussion on the three main philosophical approaches: determinism, libertarianism, and compatibilism.<br />9. Great examples that help the reader comprehend the challenging concept of free will.<br />10. Classic Harris eloquence, \\"How can we be `free' as conscious agents if everything that we consciously intend is caused by events in our brains that we do not intend and of which we are entirely unaware? We can't\\".<br />11. Does quantum mechanics provide a foothold for free will?  Find out.<br />12. Does the process of conscious deliberation provide a foundation for free will?  Find out.<br />13. Do we really control our minds?  Once again, the mastery of Dr. Harris continues.<br />14. The implications of not having a free will. Great points!<br />15. A fascinating discussion on the level of responsibility.<br />16. How does a retributive judicial system fit in all this?<br />17. Free will within a religious framework.<br />18. Free will and politics.<br />19. A final chapter that brings everything together.<br />20. Links worked great on the Kindle.<br />21. Brief, powerful essay that can be read multiple times.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. My only discomfort with the essay is the casual use of the term soul.  I understand that Dr. Harris does not accept the soul as an empirical concept and may have used the term as a metaphor (equating it to the brain in one instance) but I prefer leaving out all supernatural terms unless properly defined.<br />2. Some topics are introduced briefly and leave you wanting more, isn't that always the case with Dr. Harris?<br />3. Having to wait for Dr. Harris's next intellectual contribution.<br /><br />In summary, what makes this essay great is that the more you read the more you get out of it.  It's a profound essay that is easy to follow but is hard to master.  It is so rewarding to read interesting topics from great minds.  This essay is the ultimate appetizer, delicious and with an everlasting aftertaste.  Free will is not an easy concept to understand but a worthwhile pursuit to endeavor and Dr. Harris makes the journey a fulfilling one.  I can't recommend this brief book enough, highly recommended.<br /><br />Further suggestions: \\"[[ASIN:143917122X The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]]\\" by the same author, \\"[[ASIN:B005UD1EVG Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain]]\\" by Michael S.

B006ZCWTV0|5.0|Polls tell us 51% of Americans believe the bailout of the banks was wrong. An overwhelming majority --- 86% --- disapproves of big bonuses on Wall Street. And more than 50% feel that \\"the power and influence of banks and other financial institutions represent a major threat to the country.\\"<br /><br />You'd think that a lot of bands would have a song for those people.<br /><br />It's no great mystery what messages that music might deliver.<br /><br />A shout of rage for what vulture capitalists have done to workers and the dispossessed.<br /><br />A raised fist at the politicos and pundits who know exactly how the game is fixed and don't give a damn because they've got theirs.<br /><br />And a message of hope to all those who are struggling to pay their bills.<br /><br />The silence of other musicians -- well, finger-pointing no longer matters, for we now have that CD. It is fierce and blunt and angry, and unapologetic about its rage; in the Guardian's phrase, it's \\"a sledgehammer holding a megaphone.\\"<br /><br />And the guy who made it is 62.<br /><br />In Bruce Springsteen' s world, the plane leaves when he shows up. He's got acreage that a Texan might envy. His kid rides expensive horses. As he once wrote, \\"I've got the fortunes of heaven in diamonds and gold / I got all the bonds, baby, that the bank could hold.\\" If he were so inclined, he could go on a Greatest Hits tour until the end of time and end up far north of a billion dollars.<br /><br />But then he would not be Bruce Springsteen.<br /><br />If you've listened to Springsteen over the decades or even just dropped in on his seminal CDs, you know that one bright thread in his career is his concern for workers, the poor, the lost and the broken. It starts with \\"Born to Run\\" (1975). On one level, this record is a wet kiss to the American dream of endless youth and a four-lane highway with no speed limit. On another, it's a rebel yell, the defiant statement of a kid who's not going to let his soul be crushed.<br /><br />That kid grows up fast. \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" released just three years later, describes what it's like to discover you're not going to realize the dreams of your youth. The new challenge: to find dignity in defeat, to get married and have kids and still maintain some respectable definition of manhood in a system that reduces you to a cog.<br /><br />Jump-cut to \\"The Rising,\\" the 9/11 record that begged someone to make it. Not my favorite Springsteen, but it brought comfort to many, and that isn't small.<br /><br />And now \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" If we were to talk about the music here, I might say this is Springsteen's most interesting CD in a long time; you'll find jaunty Celtic melodies and gospel and rap and references to Pete Seeger and Johnny Cash. But the politics overshadows the music. As someone has said, this is the soundtrack of \\"Occupy New Jersey.\\" [<br /><br />What are the politics of \\"Wrecking Ball?\\" Simple: Springsteen hates the way people who have gained the world have lost all sense of connection to the rest of the planet. And now we --- he's in the 1%, but he identifies with the 99% --- are jobless and ignored. \\"The country we hold in our hearts is waiting,\\" Springsteen said during the 2004 election; eight years later, we are \\"shackled and drawn.\\"<br /><br />Some critics have dived into the politics of \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" and boy, that conversation can get granular fast. I admire their erudition, but I really don't think the politics is the main event here. Emotion is.<br /><br />By emotion, I mean primal feeling, what's revealed when everything you think you've got is stripped away. You can't really channel this; you need to have lived it. And Springsteen has. He's spoken of his father, \\"emasculated\\" when he lost his job in the `70s: \\"Unemployment is a really devastating thing. I know the damage it does to families. Growing up in that house, there were things you couldn't say. It was a minefield. My mother was the breadwinner. She wassteadfast and relentless and I took that from her.\\"<br /><br />In this CD, the wrecking ball that took down the old Giants Stadium becomes every dirty deal --- and every lost job:<br /><br />Now when all this steel and these stories, they drift away to rust<br />And all our youth and beauty, it's been given to the dust<br />And your game has been decided, and you're burning the down the clock<br />And all our little victories and glories have turned into parking lots<br />When your best hopes and desires are scattered to the wind<br />And hard times come, hard times go,<br />Yeah, just to come again...<br /><br />What do you do when you can't win? Just stand your ground. \\"Take your best shot,\\" he taunts the wrecking crew. And to us: \\"Hold tight to your anger/ And don't fall to your fears.\\"<br /><br />And this isn't the stance in just one song. The CD is shot through with a fierce refusal to sugarcoat bitter knowledge. Start with \\"We Take Care Of Our Own,\\" the song he did at the Grammys; only the brain dead could miss the irony.<br /><br />Then move on to \\"Rocky Ground,\\" which features this bit of rap (yes, rap):<br /><br />You use your muscle and your mind and you pray your best<br />That your best is good enough, the Lord will do the rest<br />You raise your children and you teach 'them to walk straight and sure<br />You pray that hard times, hard times, come no more<br />You try to sleep, you toss and turn, the bottom's dropping out<br />Where you once had faith now there's only doubt<br /><br />Samuel Johnson, 250 years ago, noted, \\"The natural flights of the human mind are not from pleasure to pleasure, but from hope to hope.\\" But as I hear it, the question at the heart of \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is: How can we go on when the game is rigged --- and there's no hope? That is, first, a commercial question. No one wants to listen to a 45-minute dirge --- you gotta give them something that doesn't make them want to slit their wrists. But beyond commerce, that is the emotional question that \\"Wrecking Ball\\" must address if it's to be any kind of help to us.<br /><br />And Springsteen does directly address it in what I see as the key song of the CD, \\"Land of Hope and Dreams.\\" It's not a new song; it's been a high point of his concerts for years. And deserves to be --- it's an invitation to salvation, and for everyone. Show biz theatrics? I think not. I think this is the moment when it all comes together, and the world drops away and the reason you're the one standing up there is revealed. It's a moment that chills and inspires, and it doesn't happen often enough.<br /><br />\\"Faith will be rewarded,\\" Springsteen sings in \\"Land of Hope and Dreams.\\" \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is the argument against that. And yet, against all evidence, this is what Springsteen affirms. Because although he's a fallen-away Catholic, he believes --- as I find myself believing --- that there is something bigger than we are. And that, just maybe, we'll be okay.<br /><br />A CD for the ages? Maybe not.

B001NLKXK2|3.0|While enlightening, this book was very depressing.  We all have someone we know, whether it be relatives or friends, who have alzheimers.  We know how sad it is and how the families have to cope with the disease.  If we don't know, we are not very knowledgeable about what is going on in the world today.  I would not choose this book to read on my own; however, my bookclub hostess picked it for the month and I had to read it.

0767836324|2.0|There are very few Peter Pan productions that I fancy. This isn't one of them. Much like the 2003 Peter Pan which I panned as well because the starring Peter looks like a dirty lost boy, this is on the other end of the scale as a middle aged Peter who simply cannot remember his past. The stage production looks entirely fake much as Robin Williams Popeye, which I even like better than this. There is the overly sentiment which tries desperately to make Peter a deep thinking individual. BORING. And the ridiculous scene of Peter regaining his thoughts and powers only to careen in like a flying invisible bicycle is utterly stupid.<br />Bob Hoskins is well cast as Mr. Smee but ends up doing nothing. Julie Roberts was even nominated as worst actress, and it shows as yet another straggled haired Tinker Belle with no magic other than the special effects crew. There are no great songs, and this should have been a musical because it looks it, but Spielberg opted to burden it with many excruciating action sequences that are not even intriguing as they are noisy. And it one particular scene of a very bad lost boy having vulgar words with the forgetful Peter is nothing short of disgusting for the Peter Pan legacy. Thank god there is a live actor that once worked at Disneyland who's name is similar to Spielberg by coincidence that has given the true meaning of what Peter Pan really is. A joyful, playful, witty, and slightly naive character that lives within all of us, myself included.

B006IDG2T6|4.0|In Free Will, the latest mini-book by Sam Harris (much like [[ASIN:B005N0KL5G Lying]]), the author is mostly preaching to the converted. I suspect that fans of his previous books, The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation, will already agree that the popular notion of free will \\"cannot be made conceptually coherent.\\" I agree too, and Harris does a good (though brief) job of explaining why the \\"libertarian\\" notion of  free will (as it is called in philosophical circles) doesn't stand up to much scrutiny.<br /><br />The bigger surprise, however, is Harris' attack on compatibilism - the view that free will and determinism are compatible - which he likens to theology, saying that it \\"amounts to nothing more than an assertion to the following creed: A puppet is free as long as he loves his strings.\\" I found this section a bit lacking and unfair. Though Harris does argue his point well, mainly contending that the compatibilist notion of free will is vastly different than the popular notion of free will.<br /><br />After all, Harris certainly knows how to make a persuasive argument. He also does a great job of discussing how determinism plays into the judicial system and politics, as well as dispelling concerns about fatalism. However, at only 66 pages, it would have been nice if he'd expanded a bit more in general. But still, it was still an overall interesting book, and well worth the small investment of time.

0525478817|4.0|Read my full review at (...)<br /><br />Finally! Now I know what the loud buzz was all about. It was a meaningful read and this book was amazing. I may be one of the few who wouldn't give a perfect 5 star rating, but it doesn't mean I loved this book any less. So for the mean time, let me tell you what I loved about this book.<br /><br />Okay. I'll skip the summary.<br /><br />When I started reading the first few pages, I found myself REALLY laughing out loud. And people around me looked at me and asked \\"what happened? what's that all about?\\" I'll tell you.<br /><br />This book is hilarious. Amazingly funny and crazy and quirky. I loved how the author wrote it. And yeah, I was laughing all the time because of the choice of words which the author used in narrating the story. It was a very good laugh, and I loved it. And that's what makes this book great and unique--the way it can make you feel that way, and still it makes you feel aware that something is wrong and something scary might happen. And I was right. I was laughing in many parts of the story, and by the end of the book, I felt like my heart was broken into pieces.<br /><br />Hazel Grace and Augustus were no perfect couple but they're perfect for each other. Their disabilities made them. What they're lacking made them whole. I think that's the best thing I got from this book. To live a grand life even though it seems that there were no reasons to do so. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters might be physically weak but they are two strong characters all through out the story. They are crazy and fun to read about. You'll love them both, plus you'll love Isaac, too. He's the amazingly funny friend of Gus and Hazel, who is blind and dumped by her ex-girlfriend. It was enjoyable to see their journey as they experience how to love, be loved, to live and die. It was amazing how the author crafted great characters that made this book very entertaining.<br /><br />What I loved most about the story is how it made me happy and sad at the same time. It felt good to laugh over a book and then cried over it afterwards. I guess there will never be enough explanation on how this book made me feel. It was hilarious and yet heart breaking. Tragic but beautiful.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to read The Fault In Our Stars. Yes, it is an emotional read and you might cry over it (make sure to ready some tissue), but it was a fun, crazy journey of two characters who have meaningful fight with cancer, who are trying to enjoy every cancer perks they were given, who wishes on Genies yet aware that the world is not a wish-granting factory. It's a story about a boy who lived grand and who rides a roller coaster that only goes up and a girl who is willing to ride the roller coaster with him. Read this book, meet these amazing characters, know what An Imperial Affliction is all about, and experience Amsterdam.<br /><br />I have my reason why I gave it a 4 coffee cups rating and I will tell you why. I was impressed by how the two characters talked about life and cancer and everything, but sometimes it was too much for me to easily get it. Some dialogue were a bit hard to understand (or maybe I'm the one with the problem *wink) but other than that, this book is great in every way.<br /><br />It was sad and heart breaking but over all it was beautiful. You should read it. I'm glad that I DID. This is the first book by John Green that I've ever read, and surely it won't be the last.<br /><br />\\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world...but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.\\" - Augustus Waters about Hazel Grace.<br /><br />P.S. I've never really liked the word \\"Okay\\" until now :)over a book and then cried over it afterwards. I guess there will never be enough explanation on how this book made me feel. It was hilarious and yet heart breaking. Tragic but beautiful.    Don't be afraid to read The Fault In Our Stars. Yes, it is an emotional read and you might cry over it (make sure to ready some tissue), but it was a fun, crazy journey of two characters who have meaningful fight with cancer, who are trying to enjoy every cancer perks they were given, who wishes on Genies yet aware that the world is not a wish-granting factory. It's a story about a boy who lived grand and who rides a roller coaster that only goes up and a girl who is willing to ride the roller coaster with him. Read this book, meet these amazing characters, know what An Imperial Affliction is all about, and experience Amsterdam.    I have my reason why I gave it a 4 coffee cups rating and I will tell you why. I was impressed by how the two characters talked about life and cancer and everything, but sometimes it was too much for me to easily get it. Some dialogue were a bit hard to understand (or maybe I'm the one with the problem *wink) but other than that, this book is great in every way.    It was sad and heart breaking but over all it was beautiful. You should read it. I'm glad that I DID. This is the first book by John Green that I've ever read, and surely it won't be the last.    \\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world...but you do have some say in who hurts you.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I was very impressed how quickly this item sharpened by knife.  Nice handy sharpener at a good price.  Thank you!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great program! I love the ability to switch translations at the touch of a button. The selection of reading plans is fantastic. My only reservation is the number of times I get a &quot;server not available&quot; message when I have an excellent wireless signal. Frustrating when it happens during church on Sunday mornings...
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover looks like a regular book when closed. It wraps completely around 360 degrees when I want to read it with the cover out of the way. It will prop open for a horizontal view. At first I had to place something behind it to keep it from slipping, but as I have broken in the binding to make it more flexible, it now stands on its own. I have the tan one and it is gorgeous. I get comments on it all the time and people are surprised there is a Kindle inside. I agree with other reviewers that it does not close completely at first because the spine is slightly too small. However, my wrapping the spine completely back on itself over time has loosened it up and it now does lay flat and it has not hurt the stability or look of the cover. I disagree with the reviewers who said the corner straps that hold the Kindle are too tight. I think they are perfect. It is easy enough to get the Kindle in and out whenever I want and I like how securely it holds the Kindle in place. I highly recommend this cover for its quality, flexibility and its great looks!
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I have always loved Creedence Clearwater Revival since they came on the scene.  I was in the military at the time and the songs that group sang gave me some joy in an era of war and unrest.  They must have been good because after all these years they are still being played across the county on the radio whem my wife and I travel.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Quick, accurate discription and my husband loved it.<br />Watched and enjoyed the day after it arrived.<br />Thank you very much.

B006MQRLSA|4.0|To start out, I have to say that I am not as huge baseball fan, ill go to a game for friendship and beer. However, Moneyball made me feel sentimental about Americas favorite pastime. Not your typical sports movie, it is more subtle. Jonah hill and Brad Pitt give great performances.
1466401885|5.0|This book is brilliant! I have never been so drawn into a book before, I feel every bit of emotion they feel and as I sit here I feel like I have lived through it. I seriously feel like i have taken on abby's life force which is weird. I can't believe a book can play with your emotions like that. Apart from the spelling mistakes, (who really cares) this book is perfection.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I think I was one of the few people who never read the book so other than listening to a radio review of the movie, I had no idea what I was walking into.  Personally I think this is the best way to see movies.  This way you can watch the movie for what it is, rather than spending your time comparing it to a book.<br /><br />This is a great movie with a amazing acting.  Please note that this is Rated R for a reason.  The topic and certain scenes are very graphic.
0439023513|5.0|The final book in the hunger games saga comes across as a bleak and jaded picture of what a society at war with itself might look like. The focus turns from the individual struggles to survive (that featured heavily in the first two) to the collective struggle to figure out who should be in charge. Unfortunately, humans don't always get it right.<br /><br />The frustrations a reader might have felt with the relationship arc in the story get resolved in this book...but, like real life, it's complicated by war, sorrow, and evil. If you have felt the slightest bit annoyed with Katniss' indecisiveness up to this point, the author will now shove it in your face and show you why it has been so. The relationship scenes in this book did not make me feel warm and fuzzy like in the others. Instead, I was left feeling hollow and sad. At least, at the end of this book, one can breathe a sigh of relief that at least the nightmare is over - on the page, if not for the characters.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I am an avid reader but very choosy about the books I read. I have to say, this very well written book had me from the very first pages and hard to put down. Look forward to more from this author.

B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this Mahjong game.  It has several games and I like the designs of them all.  It doesn't lock up on me on my Fire.
B004ZNAXX2|2.0|I love floyd but i think this is a big rip off for the price. The first two discs are basically last years remasters, the next 2 are a re-release of the live \\"Is there anybody out there\\" from 2000, quality is more or less the same, slightly better. The 4th and 5th discs are great and DVD is ok. So essentially, only real floyd fans are going to buy this and they will already have discs 1-4, so they are paying big money for 2 cds and dvd basically.<br /><br />If you never had the Wall its probably reasonable value, still think its over priced
B004W89N72|1.0|looks nice but needs to sync with google calendar.  the kindle fire doesn't curently have a stock calendar that can so this would be the perfect feature to make this app take off on the fire.
0545425115|5.0|I cannot believe it.<br /><br />I just finished reading \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />Might not sound that impressive except I was only a third of the way into the book when I picked it up again at around 6pm.  I literally could not put it down. No dinner, no bathroom break, no water, no nothing!  It's like the past 6 hours (yeah I'm a slower reader) all my body needed was this book. I cannot say I've been this entranced by a book ever, nor can I recall reading a book faster. Now I have to go put something in my stomach before I throw up. =D<br /><br />p.s. If you haven't read this book yet...READ IT!!!  NOW!!!!!<br /><br />I'm NOT KIDDING!!!!<br /><br />Stop reading this post and GO READ THIS BOOK!!!!
B004LWZW88|1.0|My sister & I saw the trailers months ago & couldn't wait for the DVD release. Wow, the trailer is very misleading. It is soooo boring, long & unimaginative. Only one short scene is funny, i.e., a \\"Dance Fight\\" scene. The rest is a very long hodgepodge of scenes involving humpty dumpty, jack & the beanstalk, and the goose that lays golden eggs. Bits of these fairy tales are haphazardly mixed together with no real story or direction. We were so bored & agreed that even when we were kids we would not have liked this over rated & over priced[[ASIN:B004LWZW88 Puss in Boots (Two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]] \\"cartoon\\".

B006P0FICE|1.0|This has got to be the worst Musketeers film ever!! It's like the writers and the director watched the all the other films and thought \\"I know how we could really destroy this\\". They have definitely NEVER read the book. If you've ever read the book DON'T WATCH THIS! When this was first coming out I was intrigued by the choice of actors. I really thought they would portray the characters well... It's a shame that they were never given a chance to actually play their parts correctly. I won't even start about Milady and Athos or this will end up as a 10 page rant.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|I've been waiting for Daria on DVD for ages, and I have to agree with a lot of people here who say they are really disappointed with the lack of original music. Though I completely understand why, it does make me a little irritated at the music industry! (Especially since the artists themselves wouldn't be making that much off of the royalties, but I digress.) Like another reviewer said, I wish they'd sprung for R.E.M.'s Everybody Hurts in the one scene- most function pretty well with the new music, but, well, everybody hurts without the proper music in that scene in particular.<br /><br />That being said, while the music definitely shaped Daria as a show, the show does a great job of standing on its own. I'm really glad I bought the box set because I will watch this over and over again. I know there are sites out there that list all the songs played on each show- maybe I should just get those songs and play them at appropriate moments! Ha!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|Plays fine was fun. Music real cheesy. Only plays at the end, though. Turned off, hope it stays off. This will be a fine time waster.

B005MMJ84K|2.0|As a fan of Delirium and Before I Fall, I was expecting a lot from Pandemonium. Unfortunately, I feel it did not deliver. Delirium set up a wonderful storyline and characters that made me very excited for this trilogy. But Pandemonium felt like just a placeholder and no new revelations or risks in the storytelling were taken until the very, very end. There are many unexplained loose ends and I feel slightly insulted as a reader that Lena is \\"magically\\" saved several times and quickly at the scenes that should be the most intense. Lena is either very lucky or Lauren Olivier has become lazy in her storytelling. Unlike Delirium, Pandemonium was split into two storylines: essentially the before and the now. At the beginning, I could feel Lena's pain and despair after losing Alex and the description of life in the Wilds was interesting and descriptive. But it went on for too long and didn't go anywhere. **SPOILER ALERT** The end scene of the Wilds where Lena's group meets the Scavengers ends quickly and doesn't explain anything about the ideology of the Scavengers or how the other members of their group were there to rescue them. Where they just hiding watching the Scavengers lay a trap? Doesn't make sense to me and I wish it would have been explained. The other big hole in the story is the set-up of Lena and Julian. It was predictable and planned by the Resistance, but why Lena? Is there something about Lena that Raven and the others knew Julian would fall in love with? Or are we just supposed to assume that any two people locked up together will fall in love? Really? I like Lena and Julian together and I do get them as a couple. I just dislike that the underlying assumption seems to be that of course they would fall in love if they were trapped together. Why would the Resistance put so much effort into the trap based on that? If the Resistance had really known all along that they would fall in love, I would have liked an explanation as to why. Also, there was an exceptional chapter in which Lena is forced to kill a rabbit as a necessary part of survival. Lena's internal struggle with this was put to words eloquently and when she and Julien first escaped their cell, it seems that Lena was careful to not harm the guard if she did not have to. Yet, slightly later she kills a young women and seems not to be emotionally affected at all. Seems incongruent to me and I don't like that she could have so easily killed that young woman after feeling so guilty for killing a rabbit. There are some other inconsistencies in the book that harm the character development and makes this novel feel like it was rushed through to get to the third. Maybe I expected too much from this sequel, but I was disappointed and I hope that the third novel gets the story back on track. The idea behind this book had so much potential and I hate to see it fall flat after a wonderful first book.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I'm thrilled with this Adele purchase. It includes the DVD and CD which I have played countless times. It includes songs from her 21 album as well as 19. Fun to hear DVD with her comments on how she was inspired for certain songs. If you are a fan of hers you will love this.
B003R4ZMNQ|2.0|While I was a little amazed that instead of filming on a set in California the producers actually filmed in Hawaii the one dimensional characters and storyline are so cliche any enjoyment is quickly forgotten.  The series should be called Clone CSI/NCIS series in Hawaii, none of the characters really stand out or are really affable not even close to tolerable.  The scripts the cast get are also one liners we've heard so many times from the previous mentioned series it's beyond pathetic, and of course we can't have them, as regular special detectives no they have to be black ops special forces doing missions that are so beyond their scope you really wonder what the writers have been drinking or smoking to think up this garbage. The actors and actresses aren't the real problem but as you hear them say their god awful dialogue you can't help but wince and facepalm as you're thinking \\"Really that's the best you could come up with!!??\\".  I had no problem with the original series but this horrendous remake is such an insult that you feel like storming the writers office of the show and throttling them until some of their higher brain cells reactivate and they actually give us an intriguing story.
1594202842|5.0|There are lots of things i believe it's exagerated in this book but they are well-deserved. Upon reading this book, i am starting to recall a lot of my high-achieving friends' moms were tiger moms. They got drilled at piano lesson, ballet lesson and intense math and science regime. Meanwhile, i get to play and watch as much tv i like!!! 25 years later, those who \\"suffered and survived\\" through piano lessons and after-school math lesson got scholarship to UPENN, Yale and MIT. Meanwhile i worked at a mediocre job with mediocre pay. Now that i'm a mom, i intend to be more strict w/ my children. I intend to set higher expectations, cultivate good habits and spend a lot more time with my kids. I don't think i have the tenacity to do what Amy Chua did(like on vacation and practicing music at same time!!!) but I do intend to work with my children and push them to their potentials so that they can have more opportunity in life. I don't want to ignore my children's problems by convicing myself that i have done my best when kids are facebooking 5 hours a day while i'm at the spa. I agree with Amy that those mom who starts with \\"it's killing me but i need to trust that my kids are making the best choice in their room on the computer\\" are lazy and are too whimpy to point out that their kids are not good enough and work needs to be done. I think a lot of parents are afraid to \\"open the door\\" and find a whole pandora box with no solution as how to deal with their rotten kids.<br /><br />As deprecating as some of her stories sound, I admire her for her honesty and committment. It's no fun driving 4 hour to NY from new haven every sunday for your kid's violin lesson. But somehow she managed to do it while the moms who are criticizing her are fixing their nails at the salon or shopping at blommingdales sales.<br /><br />The world, as we know, it's hard and getting harder out there. It's better to have your parents tell you that \\"you are not good enough and needs to work harder\\" thanto have your boss and managers tell you that you are a loser !!!

B0028MBEFI|5.0|John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) wrote in the Preface to this 1935 book, \\"This book is chiefly addressed to my fellow economists... its main purpose is to deal with difficult questions of theory, and only in the second place with the applications of this theory to practice... I cannot achieve my object of persuading economists to re-examine critically certain of their basic assumptions except by a highly abstract argument and also by much controversy. I wish there could have been less of the latter.\\"<br /><br />He contrasts his \\"General Theory\\" with the \\"classical economists\\" (e.g., Ricardo, Mill, Marshall, Pigou), and asserts that \\"the postulates of the classical theory are applicable to a special case only and not to the general case... Moreover, the characteristics of the special case assumed by the classical theory happen not to be those of the economic society in which we actually live... (so) that its teaching is misleading and disastrous if we attempt to apply it to the facts of experience.\\" (Pg. 3) Notably, the economic system may find itself in stable equilibrium at a level below full employment, owing to an \\"insufficiency of effective demand.\\" (Pg. 30)<br /><br />Of course, the book's most famous illustration is that if the Treasury were to \\"fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths... and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again... there need be no more unemployment... It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like; but... the above would be better than nothing.\\" (Pg. 129)<br /><br />He suggests that \\"the duty of ordering the current volume of investment cannot safely be left in private hands.\\" (Pg. 320) The right remedy for the trade cycle is in \\"abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom.\\" (Pg. 322) He rejects, however, the idea of State Socialism; if the State simply determines the aggregate amount of resources and the basic rate of reward, \\"It will have accomplished all that is necessary.\\" (Pg. 378)<br /><br />To appreciate Keynes' work, one must note that (1) it was written during the height of the Great Depression, when unemployment was disastrous; (2) Keynes also proposed that deficit spending to stimulate demand should be REPAID during better times [a message ignored by modern politicians]; and (3) modern economic \\"stimulus\\" packages are not necessarily what Keynes would have endorsed.  Whether you agree or not, this is a seminally important work to read and study.rd, \\"It will have accomplished all that is necessary.\\" (Pg. 378)<br /><br />To appreciate Keynes' work, one must note that (1) it was written during the height of the Great Depression, when unemployment was disastrous; (2) Keynes also proposed that deficit spending to stimulate demand should be REPAID during better times [a message ignored by modern politicians]; and (3) modern economic \\"stimulus\\" packages are not necessarily what Keynes would have endorsed.

B002ZG97EC|1.0|Buyers be aware that even though the description and the picture show the  Three disc Blu-ray, DVD, digital copy combo package that is not what you receive. As others have stated what you receive is the two disc blu-ray & DVD only. The movie itself is fantastic but if you are expecting a digital copy you will be disappointed.
B006JJBFK0|5.0|Calling a female-fronted metal band \\"ballsy\\" sounds a bit corny, but in this case, it's true.  Too many symphonic metal bands emphasize the \\"symphonic\\" more than the \\"metal,\\" but in this case, both are equally epic and equally astounding.  You won't find exaggerated virtuoso shredding, but there are abundant power riffs and plenty of blazing aggression, which is a breath of fresh air in the realm of often over-orchestrated power/progressive metal.<br /><br />Xandria's sound hearkens to the glory days of Nightwish, and the production and immense scope of the sound is even more jaw-dropping then their predecessors.  I'm talking Lord of the Rings massive epic here.  And the vocals...wow.  There are a lot of bands with an operatic frontman/woman, but I often find them a bit breathless and stiff.  Miss Kraller's vocals are soaring and effortless and very thick, in contrast to the lighter/poppier approach of other bands (I'm looking at you, current Nightwish).  As a side note, check out Liv Moon from Japan if you want an Eastern-flavored helping of operatic symphonic metal.<br /><br />Nevermore's End is quite a dramatic departure from the gothic metal/electronic sound that made them popular, but they nailed this one.  It's not a home run; it's a grand slam.  If these guys keep it up, Xandria will be synonymous with this genre.

B0068VZQCC|5.0|After 25 years and 9 studio albums, Blind Guardian have finally released their first 'Best Of' collection. Like all best of albums, some fans are going to quibble about the selection of songs that were picked for it and whether they truly do represent the \\"best\\" that Blind Guardian are capable of. Having said that, and with only one or two exceptions, it seems to me that the band have chosen many of the songs that fans go most crazy for at their live performances.<br /><br />With the album limited to \\"only\\" 16 tracks there also seems to be a good range of songs taken from all 9 studio albums, although it would have been nice to see ANATO represented by more than just the one track (And Then There Was Silence), even if that one track does clock in at 14 minutes! The songs on this album aren't presented in chronological order but, even with the old and new jumbled in together, there's a good flow between tracks and none seem out of place.<br /><br />The benefits of remixing the songs, and the rerecording of four of them, will also be a matter of subjective opinion amongst fans. I personally found that some of the old songs (such as Majesty and Traveler in Time) were really enhanced by the remixing process, while it wasn't quite so successful with others.<br /><br />As for the four rerecorded songs, it was interesting to hear the band revisit these songs after so many years and give them a modern touch up. If you enjoy the orchestral direction the band has taken with recent albums, then you'll more than likely also enjoy the new approach to both of the Bard's Songs. Although the originals are beloved for a reason, there are new elements to both Valhalla and And Then There Was Silence that are refreshing to hear, and I imagine there are going to be people who prefer the new version over the old and vice versa. If nothing else, these new recordings will serve as a snapshot of the present day Blind Guardian as Hansi's voice, while still being big and strong and powerful,has inevitably changed with age.<br /><br />If you're only just getting into Blind Guardian, this best of compilation is a great place to start since it includes tracks from their earliest to very latest albums and provides a nice overview of the way the band's sound has evolved over the years. On the other hand, if you're a real diehard fan then this album is worth acquiring for the liner notes alone - there are comments and reminiscences about each song and there's a wealth of candid photos that have been taken during the course of the band's career (I'm sure I'm not the only one who cracked up with laughter at the sight of Andre's Iron Maiden tshirt tucked into his checked pants... oh, 80's fashion, you were a hoot). And if you lie somewhere in between, this album may not be absolutely necessary for your collection, but it does provide variations for some of Blind Guardian's classic tunes.
0061537934|5.0|This book, is not a book, it's a jounery, a journral, a dipiction of the human condition, a view on the wonders and atroties of the world we all must face. The best part, the narrator is not even human. He is an extremly itelligent dog named Enzo, who see the flaws, the pain and everything else that goes into being a human, and he still wants to be human. He wants to be able to smile, laugh and be the type of person we all want to be. I must stop before i begin rambling, but I would recommend this book to everyone over the age of 13 who is human and has a heart. Some content is too harsh for younger children, but I am 15 and this is my favorite book, because of the harsh content. It is not sugar-coated it is raw human suffering that we have all faced and all fear facing again. Read the book, you will love, I love it, and hope that this review can help others love it as much as I do. you probably won't see this review, this book is so popular my little review will never be seen, but if you do see it and if you are still reading I thank you, and pleastly ask you to stop and begin reading, \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" by Garth Stien

B002ZG98J6|1.0|The movie barely follows the book, the only they really have in common are the name of characters and the fact that someone stole Zues's lightning. Spoilers!  In the movie, they removed several key characters and plot points that are important to the whole series.  They removed Ares story arc along with his daughter, Kronos (kind of important), Thalia/Tree, and the fact that Zues warned that Percy Jackson should not fly, but yet, he is flying at the end of the movie with the final battle with a pawn.  Just a terrible movie, read the book.

I have always been in good health until recently showed high triglycerides and had to be put on 20 mg Simvastatin.  Putting into practice what this book recommends will have me off statins and more energetic.  Do not miss this book.  A must read at any age.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good app with many games, the instructions for the games are confusing sometimes. but don't be discouraged, after playing a few times, you'll understand them.
B007H51DQG|5.0|I still do love the series (five stars). I do have to admit that the season dragged on and on. I know the writers will leave everything in a nail biter for the last two episodes for the season. I just hope that when the next season arrives, it just picks up pace and stays fast paced. Since the writers and producers aren't afraid of killing off characters, they better bring in better ones as well. If the season 3 does not pick up pace within 2 to 3 episodes, then, thank you amc writers and producers of the series, I'M OUT!.
B004W89N72|3.0|I think this my 2nd review, not sure. Advertised as &quot;FREE&quot; but I'm seeing a price tag next to it. I'm not cheap, but I don't like surprises on my statements.<br />In all thou, it's very decent for Kindle Fire IF it's free. For a purchase, there are much better choices.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app so much that i play it every day. i would recommend this app to all of my friends thank you for creating his app.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|This unit allows me to listen to my extensive vinyl collection again. My old Receiver has phono jacks and the first turntable my wife got me for Xmas wouldn't play thru my system, but this unit has a phono or line switch which allows you to turn on or off the pre-amp.
B004S5C91Q|4.0|I loved the way this book was written, through the voice of a 5 year old. I found the first half more enjoyable than the second, however it was still an amazing book. Recommended!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and helps pass time. I enjoy playing the games while just waiting around. I highly recommend this app to all ages.
B000EXZI0A|4.0|I really enjoy this compilation, but \\"Greatest Hits?\\" The Ramones were denied radio play until they did some uncharacteristic and misguided work with Phil Specter. While the band was always a doo-wop band that had been sniffing glue, the joy of the early records had been in the unadulterated daring of the work. This is a band that never saw boundaries and stumbled forward, bashing all the way. They never adopted arrogance or obnoxiousness, and yet the music could be the most gleefully self-destructive and rambunctious out there.<br /><br />This compilation is light on the high-gloss material, fortunately. There are some fans who will want the \\"Pet Cemetery\\" material and some who will want the material of the closing years, and those tracks are present, but most of the music is from the first three albums, and presented out of order so as to give a pretty good mix. The CD therefore works both as a play-through disk and as a collection.

B0071PS7AC|5.0|Vegas Bowling works fine (as described) when instructions are followed.  The Graphics are very smooth and pleasant, the sounds are good and the Controls work well every time.  I have found NO FLAWS with the App.  Looks like many people were unreasonably slamming this app due to their Device Limitations or their FAILURE to read and follow instructions.  As others have said: the Menu including settings and instructions are easily accessible by tapping the small arrow in upper left corner of screen.  It is wrong to slam a GOOD QUALITY APP like this one unfairly due to your choice of Device or failure to follow instructions.  The app looks and works great so it is well worth a try.  This one is a KEEPER if you like this kind of game.  Thanks to Developer.

B001ECPJZO|5.0|My eight month old grand daughter is a little too young to learn the tying, but was fascinated with every one's shoelaces.  This and the Doug and Melisa one have helped distract her from the grubby human shoe laces.  It is a little smaller than you would expect, but so attractive and well made. We all love it.

1451627289|5.0|I've always liked King, he's had his hits and misses, but who doesn't.  In 11/22/63 he hits it out of the ball park in my opinion.  Trying to get to the end kept me up later than was good for my well being on more than one night.  It may seem a little slow at first but it quickly picks up and never lets up until the end.  The story of Jake Epping going back in time to stop the assissination of JFK, falling in love with a world he did not belong in and the hard choices he had to take to finally make everything right was spellbinding, heartbreaking and ultimately satisfying. Highly recommended.

B005D0RDIE|1.0|I have to say that I was very excited to get this DVD since this was the first Rush tour I have seen so far. I was very confused and disappointed to discover that the audio dies after the opening advertisements. First we thought it was the TV or the DVD player, but we tested out the disc on another player with the same results. There just isn't any point to watching a Rush concert without the sound; the audio is the whole experience!!! Very disappointed, I am trying to find another manufacturer to buy this from.

B004W89N72|5.0|This is almost perfect for me.  I would like to see the US holidays.  It's a very simple, uncomplicated calendar for those of us who don't have abundant meetings or appointments everyday.  It is a competent app, it does what it says.  As far as those complaining that it doesn't sync with google calendar, if you have and like the Google calendar, why would you need another calendar anyway?  And, if you had read the description then you would have known that it doesn't sync with google.  So, why give it a bad rating just because it doesn't do what you want it to do?  Thank you for this style of calendar.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book to me was just a trainwreck! The whole idea of this book really disappointed me, and it wasn't even necesscary.<br />Like another reviwer said, it gave me the Twilight vibe when they talked about who the gir who choose when she was asleep. I do NOT want to be thinking of vampires an werewolves while reading that kind of scene.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD!!<br /><br />The whole killing of one Prim irked me a lot. I could have gone thhe whole book wthout seeing her die. Heck, why couldn't you just kill that damn cat.<br /><br />SPOILER END.<br /><br />The characters were no fun this book. Haymitch wasn't even really into the whole Capitol mess, Katniss became scared and helpless and always  seemed to be in the hospital, Gale was jut boring, and Peeta wasn't even Peeta, more like an aien from another planet!!<br /><br />All in all, the book seemed messy and rushed for a finish. The ideas were bogus, and didn't find myself crying, laughing, or even getting excited. By the end, I was skimming the book I was so bored.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Really good app...really addicting!! Definitely recommend to download :) If there is a downside I'd have to say everytime you deal you get the ad which can be annoying, but you deal. Nothing major!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|great time waster. please read the help to understand the controls. after a couple of games I bowled my first 300. lacks any bells and whistles but kills time.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I purchased the season pass for Downton Abbey. I thoroughly recommend it. You get a (small) price break on the per episode price and the quality of the streaming video was very good.<br /><br />As for the actual show ... Downton Abbey is simply phenomenal. The writing is exceptional and the acting is superb.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|I haven't read God of Carnage by Yasmina Reza, but I think Polanski's cinematography itself deserves 5 stars. Most likely dark humor covering all contemporary culture idols with vomit in literal as well as metaphorical sense covering all does come from the play, but Polanski surely did a great job of bringing all this to us in a crisp modern setting which makes every screen look like an art piece in itself, by placing every person and every single object in the exact place where it should be, by having selected exactly right actors, colors, sounds, everything.<br /><br />Reza's  misanthropic message (I'm sure it's there in the play) comes across forcefully in Polanski's rendering, and the film covers not just modern culture, but human relationships in general, including what we call \\"fair\\" competition in the industrial world, psychopathic industry captains, women whose life is all facade with no substance, parents who bring children in this world without really knowing what for and what they really want from life themselves...<br /><br />This film is considered black comedy, but I think this is too narrow a definition. It is black, to be sure, and yes, it's superbly sarcastic, but it's not a comedy, it's as deadly serious as life  ever can be.<br /><br />This movie can be seen as anti-American, but I think it's bigger than that, it's misanthropic in general, especially so considering that the world around us becomes more and more Americanized by the hour.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of fun. All ages can enjoy. Games are family friendly and each level brings, bigger and better games to both challenge you and make you laugh.
0767810856|3.0|Last night's bargain rack DVD movie was \\"it Could Happen To You\\" staring Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda. Only Hollywood could come up with something like this. A NYC cop lacks enough money to tip a waitress, a total stranger, so he offers to split a freshly-purchased lottery ticket with her if he wins. She graciously agrees and they part. Well, folks, I bet you can't guess what happens. You're right, he wins 4 million dollars the next day. Then he's forced into telling his money-grubbing wife that he gave away half of the lottery winnings to a woman he doesn't even know and she doesn't even know who he is or that he won, but that they had agreed and it was a matter of honor that they split it. Did I mention that the waitress was married to a money-grubbing husband? Well, I'm sure you could have guessed by now. Sappy? Well, that's only the beginning. Then the financial vultures swirl in and by the time they're done neither the cop nor the waitress have anything but one another. Again, you probably guessed. But not all was lost, because of the generosity of the cop and the waitress, the wonderful people of NYC send them bundles of five and ten dollar donations to the point where they have over six hundred thousand dollars and they lived happily ever after, or something like that.<br /><br />So, what did I think of this wonderful uplifting fantasy movie? The cinema was okay. The acting was okay, but Cage looked embarrassed at his own efforts from time to time. It's hard to imagine any of the cast members taking the script seriously, yet it certainly wasn't a comedy. Or maybe it was a comedy and the joke was on the public who paid good money to see it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best app ever especially for kids.you can play so many games and its free. they don't try to charge you on buying coins
B00001PE4D|4.0|The four leads here do a nice job of portraying a corrupt young woman, her stepbrother, and two other women that they try to destroy  in various ways, apparently just to see if they can and to get off on the feeling of power that comes with conquest.<br /><br />Fortunately, the ones involved get what they deserve in the end.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this game, it's just hard sometimes when you don't have enough points to get new games. it can be really irritating.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was my first Landay so I didn't know what to expect.  It is well written and interesting but it just seems to be a little bit hard to believe some of his situations.  Don't know that a DA could get away with some of the things done in this book but then it is fiction.
B0065GC0BA|3.0|After reading the great reviews for this book, this book sounded like a must read. I agree with other reviewers, it will play on your mind and you will think about it and discuss afterwards given its thought-provoking ethical dilemma.<br /><br />However, it left me thinking, why doesn't Amazon have a 'I really don't know what to think of this book' button/rating?<br /><br />On one level it is a great read, on another level, prepare yourself for a serious topic and one that may well leave you angry/depressed/sad - or possibly a combination of all three, depending on your own life experiences and/or value system.<br /><br />I read both serious literature and light-hearted escapist fiction. This book falls somewhere between the two extremes and manages to be neither, simultaneously.
B004W89N72|5.0|I am too dumb to figure out the calendar that came on the phone but this one is perfect for my needs. I am very glad I got it....and totally recommend it!  And yes I got it free today but I would definitely buy it.. For my needs it is perfect
0783225903|2.0|The only thing that I liked about this movie is the creative set and the imagery.<br />The movie drags on and on, and is just another example of how weird the British are.<br />I would categorize this as more of a weird British musical.
B007H51DQG|3.0|*spoilers*<br /><br />Poor Dale, he was such a humanitarian; a real Mensch and likable character. I think the group really took him for granted and killing off his character was an epic fail on part of the writers as he was not only a likable character but also represented a balancing force in the dynamic of the group. Now they are left with the trigger happy hanging judges that run the group and it's going to be hard to water down the intensity of their polar opposite points of view. And if rumors of serious cast changes are true, more deaths are to come as we approach the season finale.<br /><br />I noticed that in this show most of the characters are beginning to behave in a way designed to service a desired plot outcome (like Carl attracting the Walker to get Dale killed) instead of the plot responding to the characters. For example, Lori and Rick must be just about the dumbest parents ever. Who lets their kid (that was just recently shot), wander around unsupervised in a world run over by the flesh eating undead? ESPECIALLY after what happened to Sophia. I mean that stupid kid was wandering the woods, climbing into the barn with Randall yelling \\"I am a man, I can take care of myself\\", was almost eaten by a Walker and not once did his dumb parents wonder where he is. That is not very believable and was obviously put in there to service the desired plot outcome.<br /><br />And then that kid Randall: they all act like there was NO alternative to execution, just so the writers can put the characters in a situation where they have to contemplate his execution. But there were other options besides murdering the kid and the writers DIDN'T do a good job at showing us that they really had exhausted all those and had to now consider execution for lack of a better alternative. It wasn't believable and again, put in there to service the desired plot outcome.<br /><br />The logically incoherent rules and reversals of elements according to whether they need them in an episode is also annoying. The Walker that attacks Carl is not strong enough to pull his feet out of the mud and is barely able to wrap its paws around him, but just a few hours later tears a man's chest cavity open with his bare hands? I didn't think that was even possible. A wild animal with claws needs to put more work in that but in this case the Walker just went through Dale like a hot knife through butter. And where did that stealth zombie come from anyway? One moment we see Dale walk in an open field with no one is sight for miles, next minute a clumsy Walker is standing behind him.<br /><br />Hershel goes from \\"No guns and violence on my farm\\" to \\"meh, kill whoever you want, I dont care\\". And for Rick, the decisive reason not to cold-bloodedly murder someone is not what Dale said, but that his kid is watching, whom he just five minutes ago asked to never ask any questions or disagree with anyone, no matter what. Are they kidding me? The dialogue in this dhow must have been written by juvenile boys. It is conpletely devoid of any kind of substance, wit and insight. The writers have gone from quoting William Faulkner in season 1 to Lori giving Andrea a hard time for not being a good submissive woman who knits and does laundry for the big strong men and Rick telling his kid, whom he never even asked what he actually said to Carol, to just summarily shut up and never ever ask any questions or question anyone. Great values to instill on your kid. This show should seriously be the called A/-holes on the Zombie Farm, because that is what most of the characters are.<br /><br />It is also insulting that T-Dog, who did have somewhat of an interesting role in season 1 (and even beginning season 2) and actually had meaningful conversations with other people, barely ever appears anymore and when he does, he is standing in the corner quietly. I think his \\"what do we do with the body\\" single line was the most he has said since episode 3 of this season, which just points to the overall crappy cheapness of this show (dont have to pay actors that dont talk much or are seen, same location...). T-Dog's role in the show and group has been reduced to that of doing the grunt work. Sure, let the token black guy take orders from king Rick and queen bee Lori. What's gonna be next? let him be eaten by zombies?<br /><br />They should bring the focus back on the apocalypse and what caused it and survival and leave the farm and they should use zombies as another character in the show - as Jenner did - instead of as just props that pop up every now and then so that the producers and writers can check it off their list of things to do. Didn't Rick see a helicopter when he was in Atlanta? Whatever happened ot that? Seriously, it seems like the writers are making this up as they go.<br /><br />The previews are unfortunately showing that we are going to go back to that Rick/Lori/Shane triangle and I just don't care about these peoples' personal issues. No one does. The world has come to end, get over yourselves and your petty affairs you selfish dolts. Why couldn't they have gotten rid of Lori? Everyone's problem would be solved if Lori was gone, because let's face it, as the Alpha, Rick is acting like the judge, jury and executioner to prove to the other Alpha, Shane, that he can take care of the water hole and his mate.<br /><br />I hear something about the comic's nemesis The Governor making his way through season 3. So then it will be this group vs. the Governor's gang. Like Boys in the Hood but in a zombie setting. Yawwwn. Been there, done that. Not very original.<br /><br />And hey, if you run into a group that looks like they wanna hurt you, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. No reason to waste 22 episodes on it and artificially build the story around it.  It is not like there is only one patch of land left for all of humanity and these people had to fight for it. Again, the writers are artificially extending these peoples' struggles by creating directions and \\"issues\\"that don't make sense. this isnt south central LA. You dont like, move on.<br /><br />As to Dale, story wise, maybe it is better he died. He wasnt going to make it in this world. He pretty much lost out on the execution debate as no one had his back and thought he was some naive and delusional old guy. And he said that he didnt want to live in this kind of a world anymore. So his demise, while tragic, was his peace.<br /><br />If they do that with too many characters, though, I suspect alienation by fans. People are drawn to not only the story but also characters and historically shows that have gotten rid of major characters ended up alienating the fan base, eventually facing cancellation. That and please gt/fo of this farm. And goodbye Jeffrey DeMunn, loved your character.

B002SJKWZ4|5.0|Works as advertised.  Here are some tips to remember if you buy one.<br /><br />Read the instructions carefully and follow the manufacturers suggestions for operation closely.  A no-brainer, but skipping ahead or improvising is not helpful.<br />You don't need to make huge motions, we found that small motions work better.<br />Rotate the wand very slowly for the rotational tricks.  You'll find the sweet spot.<br />Ditch the stock batteries. Remember to insert the new ones Positive side facing OUT.<br />Don't think of this as a One-For-All replacement, instead use it for a volume and playback of your TV and media playback device. You'll probably still need your other remotes if you have a complex system, but once you break out the Wand it's party time!<br /><br />The command feedback system is pretty darn cool, it pulses the number associated with the command you're using.<br /><br />Bought this for my wife's birthday, initially felt I was paying waaaay too much for a basic remote, but this gift is all about the fun and cool presentation.<br />Yeah, it costs a lot, it's harder to use than a universal remote, but you should see the look on my wife and children's faces when she uses it!

B006YXTRHY|4.0|I haven't even seen the two movies before this one, but I'm glad I gave Breaking Dawn a try. Granted, the love part is a little overkill sometimes, but I liked the cinematography! If you're looking for an action flick, probably not the top choice, but I don't think that was the purpose of the story to begin with! It's more about the psychological side of the characters in making choices and dealing with consequences. I thought the movie did a nice job and I'd watch it again. :)
B0071PS7AC|1.0|omg the controls for this game are terrible. don't waste your time and data space with this game. this should be removed from the market.

B002N2SYWE|5.0|This is a very well-made movie.  It has an excellent and thought-provoking story-line.  It is also extremely disturbing, and will take a while after seeing it to fully digest what you had seen.  I bought this on DvD at first.  I watched it (and I did need a few breaks) and let it sit for a few days.  Any movie that is original, provokes an emotional response and causes me to think about it for a long period of time goes to near the top of \\"my list.\\"  I later bought it on blueray and gave my dvd copy to a friend.<br /><br />I heard somewhere that Fox is remaking this and changing the ending.  Sometimes it seems like all we do is remake movies.  I am never going to see our remake of this.

B004JN1D2I|1.0|I picked up the fist of these books just hoping for a good read, but soon found that the writing, which I found tolerable at first, soon turned pornographic! What a way to ruin a books potential! If you can do no better than to waste perfectly good paper by filling it up with that garbage in order to keep your readers attention, then maybe you should give up writing....  I'm happy to say, I got my money back on this one.

B005HQ5S3G|4.0|Let's get this out of the way: Get the deluxe version. It's only a buck or so more right now and you get 4 excellent songs: one being the #1 country pop power ballad hit \\"Don't You Wanna Stay\\" featuring Jason Aldean and the others being great pop rock songs with nice, catchy guitar work. \\"Dark Side\\" by far and away is the best track here with a dance beat and relatable lyrics about EVERYONE having something wrong with them but still deserving love. The last bonus track \\"The Sun Will Rise\\" is my second favorite here and is very inspirational. \\"Alone\\", another deluxe version track is next best and probably the most rockin' song on the whole album. In said song, Kelly articulates feelings about a partner who makes her feel like she's solitary when with him. Lastly, \\"Let Me Down\\" is probably the fourth best track which is on both versions of the album and very fun dance pop-ish. \\"The War Is Over\\" is an honorable mention because of its emotional nature and desiring to keep the peace instead of losing a pointless fight. :)<br /><br />This album at first worried me. There are some standard tracks that do the job fine but don't break any new ground in any way, shape or form and they made me feel that this album was a bit boring on the first couple of listens. But most of the tracks do gel fine and this will probably go down as one of Kelly's better records. Compared to the last, this one is a bit more dancier with less guitar work when ALL I EVER WANTED was a ton of rock guitars and some dance music thrown in for good measure. I think I prefer Kelly when she's sitting comfortably in front of guitars but a good mix of both is always nice too. Like I said, a solid work.<br /><br />4.4 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Dark Side\\"<br />\\"The Sun Will Rise\\"<br />\\"Alone\\"<br />\\"Let Me Down\\"<br /><br />HONORABLE MENTION(s):<br />\\"The War Is Over\\"

B0071PS7AC|4.0|...once you read the instructions. You DO know how to read, right? I find this to be a decent bowling simulation, certainly one of the better ones on android. However, there is no splash screen, no high scores, no easy way to change difficulty or choose the \\"player\\" (the help hints that one player is possible but for the life of me I cannot find that option anywhere), etc. and it kind of leaves the game feeling like it is unfinished.
B003BVFZ4Q|3.0|I wasn't sure if there was a point in purchasing a book on writing from an author that I had never read from before, but because I had heard of Stephen King and his books I decided to give it a shot.  Overall \\"on writing\\" is a good book that gives some useful clues on how to write, but for $8 I don't think it gives that much.<br /><br />The main advice from this book is read a lot, write a lot.  The book even tells the reader that if they're not a good writer then don't expect the book to help them become one.  The books an interesting read and the short story at the back is excellent but if you're looking for a book to teach you how to write then this book won't do a lot for you.<br /><br />Using some of the tips in this book I've wrote my own book, it can be found below.

0792839730|4.0|\\"A Bridge Too Far,\\" (1977) is an MGM war film, a historical action drama that is based on historian Cornelius Ryan's World War II blockbuster bestselling history of the same name ([[ASIN:0684803305 A Bridge Too Far: The Classic History of the Greatest Battle of World War II]]).  It was directed by Richard Attenborough, ([[ASIN:B00003CXA4 Gandhi]]) to a script written by distinguished screenwriter William Goldman ([[ASIN:B00005M2CO Marathon Man]]).  It is fairly accurate historically, set in Holland, in 1944, based upon a joint British/American/Polish operation, dubbed Market-Garden, involving 35,000 men, in an attempt to capture several bridges to Germany.  The top brass thought that it might speed up the end of the war, to, perhaps, the famous, long-wished, home before Christmas.  It called for thousands of men to reach the area of Arnhem, by parachute, road, and even boat.  Unfortunately, the territory was inhospitable, the only roads were very narrow, hardly suited to the passage of tanks, and there were several well-rested German armies in the area about which the Dutch resistance had been trying to warn the Allies.  But the top brass didn't want to know.<br /><br />The film runs 175 minutes, and plays out on a gigantic, complicated scale showing many divisions, many armies, requiring, seemingly, many thousands of male extras.  Battle sequences are filmed onsite. They are intense and gritty, apparently, accurate, and not for the faint of heart.  Fortunately, the film is also top heavy with male stars, so that even me, who is not that knowledgeable about those things, can know, for instance, that when Michael Caine appears on screen, trotting out his best Irish accent, he's supposed to be commanding the Irish Guards.  To run through all those male stars, in no particular order whatsoever: two great favorites of mine, Caine, as Lieutenant Colonel J.O.E. Vandeleur, Irish Guards; and Sean Connery, as Major General Urquhart, in red beret. Dirk Bogarde as Lieutenant General Browning; Ryan O'Neal as Brigadier General Gavin. Gene Hackman as Major General Sosabowski.  Edward Fox as Lieutenant General Horrocks.  Anthony Hopkins as Lieutenant Colonel Frost. James Caan as Staff Sergeant Dohun.  Gerald Sim as Colonel Sims. Colin Farrell as Corporal Hancock. Alun Armstrong as Corporal Davies; Anthony Milner as Private Dodds.  Elliott Gould as Colonel Stout.  Robert Redford as Major Cook.  Maximilian Schell and Hardy Kruger play German generals.  Laurence Olivier shows up as a Dutch national, Doctor Spaander; as does Liv Ulmann, as Kate Ter Horst, the sole female to have star billing in this huge, dark enterprise.  Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Adolph Hitler show up as themselves, in archival footage, as do Generals Omar N. Bradley, Charles De Gaulle, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Bernard L. Montgomery, George S. Patton, and Erwin Rommel.  Joseph E. Levine got the top producers credit. Geoffrey Unsworth deserves great praise as cinematographer. The evocative, mood-setting music was by John Addison, who had himself been a tanker in the operation.<br /><br />It's really superbly done giving us fierce, chaotic glory.  Largely in color, of course, with the archival footage in black and white. The acting is topnotch throughout.  Director Attenborough must have had the abilities of a general himself, to keep all the necessary projectiles in the air.  BRIDGE TOO FAR is one of my favorite war movies, and I don't like many, no more than a dozen.  Not that I am a pacifist.  It's just that all those uniformed men tend to look alike to me.  Once upon a time, in WWII films actually made during WWII, every one had a hillbilly, an Italian kid, a Jewish kid, and William Bendix as the Irish kid from Brooklyn.  Easy to tell them apart.  But the only two men I could recognize in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN were Tom Hanks and Matt Damon.  Of course, I can recognize most of the actors in DIRTY DOZEN.  And in this one.  Recommended, even to women.eneral Browning; Ryan O'Neal as Brigadier General Gavin. Gene Hackman as Major General Sosabowski.  Edward Fox as Lieutenant General Horrocks.

B005UBNKWO|5.0|According to Passmark, this little gem processes data at 1/2 the rate of Intel's flagship 3960x, It's not the fastest architecture on the bloc, but AMD has nothing to be ashamed of, here.  At 10% of the price for Intel's flagship, this CPU delivers real world bang without the need for extra bucks.<br /><br />Super pi turnaround has been astounding on the default rate processor when compared with times generated with a retired quadcore intel.  Overclocking to 3.9 GHz required negligible effort, and the system was stable without need of additional CPU voltage. On full load, the 3.9 GHz set processor has not exceeded 37C, although this outcome benefited from water cooling.

B0036R92V2|4.0|Django is one of the best of the non Sergio Leone Italian westerns period!

B000002J6H|5.0|I was 19 when this recording was released.  At a moment when rock music was more of a religion than a business model, Stephen Stills was a god.  The test of time may have given this album a C+ judging from the reviews posted here.  But when it was released, it was as well received by my generation as any record ever was.  And by the way, anyone questioning Stephen Stills musicianship or musical contributions to the classic groups he belonged to is speaking from ignorance.  Do your homework, you idiot, and you will easily find that he is ranked among the top rock guitarists and songwriters of all time by everyone with a right to an opinion.  I guess you had to be there to understand.

B004H4XI5O|4.0|A good friend who works with stroke victims and acquired brain injuries clients recommended this book to me, because she knew of my interest in brain research with regard to aging and sustaining our mental capacities.  It's a quirky book, fun to read, but with valuable information if you are looking for it.  The author is a solid writer, somewhat like Malcolm Gladwell, who skillfully weaves together cutting edge research reporting and his own personal adventures.  From my viewpoint, that makes for compelling reading.<br /><br />I am still trying out his methods for remembering names, and it seems to be working.  However, I have only been trying for a couple of weeks, and cannot say how long I will hold that information in my mind.  I am convinced that the tools he describes will work extremely well with marketing for establishment of brands, political identities, etc.

0230709532|4.0|My 1 year old really likes this book.  She loves lifting the flaps and looking at the animals.  I think it's a cute, quick read.  She doesn't like to sit still for long stories, but she will sit through this one before she is off to pick another book.  Since she likes it so much, I decided to order a copy for a baby shower I will going to soon.  I mistakenly ordered the \\"mini-edition.\\"  When it came I was very disappointed to see how tiny it was, and only the outer cover is hard.  The interior pages are thin paper.  They will not stand up to a child looking through it multiple times.  It's not worth it for me to send it back, but I'm sad about it.  Why even bother manufacturing a thin paper lift-a-flap book for babies?  They're both almost the same price anyhow.  Order the BOARD book!

B0071PS7AC|4.0|I know I shouldn't complain about freebies, but the free daily downloads from the Amazon App Store are usually pretty bad.  Today's game is a pleasant surprise.  This game is actually pretty decent.  The sounds and the visuals are really good.  They don't look like somebody created them in one of their freshman Computer Science classes.  And the physics are way better than most of the recent daily downloads.<br /><br />So yeah, I realize it's just a bowling game, but it's a pretty fun bowling game.  The Kindle Fire isn't the world's best gaming platform, but this game really plays well on the device.<br /><br />Try it out.  See how long it takes to get a strike.  It's harder than it sounds, but it's pretty fun to try.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I have noticed a WHOLE lot of people complaining about Ultraviolet copy. This is a good sign, and hopefully through this some change in WB will come.<br /><br />But this is not the MAIN complaint of my review. My main complaint is with a horrible scene that sprouted from the film itself. I don't mind TOO much if they skip things because I know that the movies and books are two different things. And I have been delighted at some additions, as it just adds cool stuff about our favorite characters. This is not the case with this film.<br /><br />I will give spoilers: Minerva orders 200 children ranging from ages 11 to 18 to be locked in a dank dungeon. In this dungeon they will be in the MIDDLE of a deadly attack by Death Eaters, as the entire Hogwarts is being attacked. The reasoning, you might ask? Because ONE of these 222 panicked when Voldemort threatened to kill them all if they didn't turn over Harry Potter. This is a war crime.<br /><br />If you defend this scene on the basis that they were SLYTHERINS, then I am really worrying about your morals or your mental health. They are children, and Rowling has said herself that the majority are NOT evil.<br /><br />There is even proof that this is out of character: In the book, Minerva sends everyone to safety. This Aberforth challenged this and says angilly\\" We could have captured a few to be used as hostages!\\" Harry says: \\"Your brother would never do it.\\"

B000QRIGJY|4.0|This is a very good book, a solid entry in the Det. Bosch series. It is also rather short.  But I would rather have a book be short and well written than suffer through alot of superfluous chapters or repetitive reading that so many authors use as fill to pad the length of their books.  Still, I wish Connelly had taken the time to develop the story a bit more before solving the crime.  It definitely felt rushed. I certainly would have liked to spend additional time enveloped in a very interesting plot.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|First the price to get all 3 books was incredible. The books themselves were rivetting. I was skeptical based on the description, but just a few pages in and I was hooked. The characters are in great detail that you see them in your mind from beginning. There are twists and turns that keep you turning the pages. I love this series so much it took only a week to read all 3 books and now my teenager is reading it with just as much interest.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The second book in a trilogy usually suffers from the same issues that a middle child does:  It has a hard time defining its identity and tries to overcompensate in very awkward ways.<br /><br />Not true with Beautiful Darkness.<br /><br />This is a fantastic follow-up to Beautiful Creatures.  The story continues with Ethan and Lena trying to put the pieces of their lives together, along with the rest of the town.  As Lena approaches her seventeenth birthday, she must choose between the world of the Light Casters and the Dark Casters.  Without giving too much away, we know that Lena is good at heart, but her choice isn't simple.<br /><br />Beautiful Darkness introduces a new character named Liv, a teenage girl from England who is studying under Marian's tutelage in the library.  Liv's character is a great addition to the story.<br /><br />And just like in Beautiful Creatures, the writing is superb.  Garcia and Stohl do a great job with their charcters, the plot, the setting, and the dialog.  I'm envious of their talent.  But even more so, their descriptions of Ethan's & Lena's families (even as messed up as they are) and of their small Southern town all just makes me feel good.  As much as I love the story lines, I also just love the way their books feel.<br /><br />Plus there's still one more book in the trilogy to go!

Seeing as there are no physical production costs for the item, the price seems unfair. If should at least be equal to the price of the paperback set, if not less. Someone who paid for a Kindle should not then be given higher prices. Definitely not buying this item on principle alone, and as a weekly traveler I have no interest in the bulky paperback set.

B006CBSE86|5.0|In a word, amazing! It took about three full listens, but this album really takes you on a journey of different emotions through dreamlike and nightmarish fantasies and near-realities. Any fan of Nightwish should probably appreciate or love this album. I think it's their most ambitious album to date, and I can tell they worked a long time on this album. It's worth listening to if you're a fan of operatic, symphonic rock and metal. There is even a song that reminds me of a 1940's jazz lounge, like I said, very ambitious! I can't really pick a favorite, but Storytime probably stands out the most, along with Scaretale and Song of Myself, the latter mostly because of the lengthy spoken word section at the end.
B0000029GA|5.0|What can I possibly even say that has not been said? I'll keep it simple. This is my favorite rap album of all time. Have I listened to it 100 times yet?

You never go more than a week from my ears because of this album.
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />Is there anyone out there who will buy this album for their first taste of Bruce Springsteen?  I'd like to think so, I hope so, but I wonder.  How many new fans do artists of Springsteen's renown pick up along the road that leads past their seventeenth studio album?  While I don't know the answer to that question, I do know that there will be plenty of hardcore fans quick to digest and analyze every aspect of WRECKING BALL.<br /><br />Surely many will point out that this is already the title of a much-admired 1996 album by Springsteen-admirer Emmylou Harris (she has covered a number of his songs) that also includes a title track entitled \\"Wrecking Ball\\" (written by Neil Young).<br /><br />Many will write about where on the record the late, great Clarence Clemons' sax solos can be found, how this is not an E-Street Band album, in what ways producer Ron Aniello may have influenced the sound of the record, and whether it's a good thing or a bad thing that \\"Death to My Hometown\\" sounds like The Dropkick Murphys.<br /><br />And I imagine many will mention that three of the eleven songs on WRECKING BALL have already been played at live shows for years, with \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" heard both in concert (as early as 1999) and on record from the LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY album.  This song is a sweeping, Cinerama-sized tribute to the American spirit that anchors a new album full of the kinds of grand musical gestures that Springsteen does best.<br /><br />But maybe all that really matters is that WRECKING BALL finds Springsteen in the midst of much hand clapping, boot stomping, whoopin' and hollerin', Irish and Gospel infused rock and roll goodness.  Times are hard but the music's good and the singer has something to say.  Although Bruce hasn't worn a blue collar in a long time he still gets an honorary one for giving a voice to the folks who aren't heard, folks who are perpetually \\"another day older and closer to the grave,\\" who feel they're \\"trudging through the dark in a world gone wrong\\" and who literally see and feel that \\"Up on banker's hill the party's going strong/Down here below we're shackled and drawn.\\"<br /><br />It seems Springsteen's carnivalesque rock and roll-as-church motif has rarely been this black and white.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|Item arrived fast, was as described and worked perfectly. Plug and play at it's best. Highly recommend. Pictures transferred automatically and required no action on users part to wok.
B006FE83UE|5.0|DVD arrived in excellent condition.  No problems with purchase.  Movie is great!  I plan to continue to purchase items from Amazon because of excellent service.
B001HN6922|5.0|Violent for a kids movie but was absolutely hilarious. I loved it and have watched it 5 times since I have received it. Great movie.
B000O14VAU|4.0|It was nice to see the beginning of the Underworld series. I saw this after watching Rise of The Lycans, and the movie made a lot more sense after seeing the first Underworld. The video quality is ok, but it's standard definition which is to be expected. I watched it on my tv through my xbox; there weren't any visual problems. The visuals in the movie were pretty good for a nearly 10 year old movie, good sound too. I really have to check out the new Underworld, but I think I may have to wait until it comes out on Blu-ray.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app, can type documents in class its really good for the kindle fire since there is no real app to create documents. I love that it syncs directly to my computer as well.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love the game but it needs more challenge of a challenge with other Colors of cards also. maybe a few surprises thrown in.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I wish I read the reviews first. I have the fire and it won't. download. so I repeat WHAT GIVES?!?!??!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good app. some games are easy while others not so much! do not do the update! deletes all progress. hope your experience was better than mine!
B0071PS7AC|3.0|This would be a fun game if I could invest a lot of time into getting better at it.  IT IS POSSIBLE to throw well, but I haven't been able to do it with much consistency.  I can see where it might be next to impossible to throw a good ball on a smaller screen though.  I think I would be willing to put a lot more time into learning the nuances of throwing in this game if I were able to play against other people (real ones...) or if it kept an average (it's BOWLING... it should definitely keep an average). As-is though - the app will likely sit in my history.<br /><br />If you're looking for a game with a steep learning curve, this might be for you - it's very well done.  Also plays and looks great on the kindle fire.
B00425S1H8|4.0|I am a network engineer and I use a serial port adapter all of the time. I bought this and hooked it up to my Windows 7 laptop. I was pretty amazed when Windows linked me right to the download link for the drivers, directly from the plug and play screen! I've had two BSoD when using this, but it's been pretty solid. I would recommend to anyone.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Do not get this on kindle fire. I just got it and it downloaded. it will not open.it said that it is not compatible. DO NOT GET THIS APP. I WANT A REFUND NOW!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun games to play when you are passing time. Just wish you didn't have to spend so many points when picking a new game.
B006ON41FC|1.0|the game it's self is pretty fun, but the programmers included this stupid reminder for every time you open it ut wants you to rate it.... and ut is frustrating. enough that I'm giving it only 1 star!
0061537934|5.0|I just finished this book and it has gone into my top 30 list.  I loved it.  Do not be put off by the fact that it is told by a dog.  This does not in any way take from it.  In fact Enzo the dog comes across as a person anyway.  It is a lovely read, original and unique.
1451629184|5.0|having only heard about this story a couple years ago, browsing books at the local store this one caught my eye. I could not put it down. i'm not an avid reader but I finished this book in just a few days. There are other books out there about Jaycee and this case but there is nothing like hearing it from the brave woman herself. Anyone can write about this from what they read in other books and stories but nobody can capture what it was really like, the emotion, terror, relief and joy they way she can. If you want to read a book about this case look no further. All other books do not compare to the heartfelt words written by Jaycee.
B007DX39XW|5.0|Lego Creator Town Hall is the largest modular made by Lego to this date! 2766 pieces! Town Hall fits well into your Lego Modular City and compliments Fire Brigade being somewhat similar in design and brick tone. 3 Stories Tall, the functioning elevator is a lovely touch. Each Floor has fun play features. However the third floor is a little empty. This is easily remedied with furniture and other modifications!<br /><br /> The 8 minifigures included are all great additions to Lego modular city such as the Mayor, Janitor, and a Bride and Groom! There are many new Lego elements including new Greek Style Column Bricks that decorate the entrance to Town Hall.<br /><br />Like all Creator Modulars, Town Hall is an excellent family project that teaches patience, coordination and team work!<br /><br />I highly recommend this set!
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|I must admit that was with much trepidation that I looked forward to this album. The pre-release  hype about it being \\"his angriest album yet\\" filled me with both dread and curiosity, as did the fact that it was said to include \\"hip-hop\\" beats, samples, and even rap. If by hip-hop beats he means the opening  of \\"This Depression,\\"have no fear, for the drum that kicks off that song  is as old and hoary as the opening beats of J.Geil's Love Stinks (1980). Elsewhere he uses the synth-line from his own\\" Secret Garden\\" in the rousing title track, and essentially rewrites \\"All or Nothing (at All)\\"  from Human Touch on \\"You Got It\\". But there is nothing wrong with an artist of the stature and longevity of Bruce Springsteen revisiting familiar themes and motifs, and on Wrecking Ball, Bruce pays homage to every era of his long career. \\"Jack of All Trades\\" has both a haunting melody that would not have been out of place on The River, and a killer guitar solo from Tom Morello, that echoes long after the fade out. Much has been made of the \\" I would shoot the bastards on sight\\" line , but it seems to be said in a tone of bitter resignation rather than blind anger. Indeed, bitter resignation and even hope--either in the form of lyrics, or in the uplifting music that often belies the song's subject matter--seem to be the watch word, not anger. No where is this more apparent than in the jaunty Irish singalongs \\" Death to My Hometown\\", \\"Shackled and Drawn\\", and the remake of his Seeger Sessions stand out, \\"American Land\\", available as a bonus track on the Special Edition.  (Wrecking Ball will no doubt have many seeking out The Seeger Sessions, and it's Live in Dublin companion piece). Another reworked song is the fan favorite \\"Land of Hopes and Dreams\\" here making it's studio debut. It's no where near as good as the live rendition from Live in NYC, which remains definitive, but it does contain the last saxophone solo from the late Clarence Clemons, and when that sound wails in, thefinality of the Big Man's death really sinks in and it's hard for even the strongest to suppress a quiver in your lips and a tear in your eye....Wrecking Ball sounds put together, assembled. What I mean is, I sense that these songs are the fruits of many sessions over a long period of time. There are many overdubs, samples, strings, horns, voices thrown in the mix, and Ron Aniello  has done a fine job piecing it all together. One more thing about the pre-release hype. Much was made of Springsteen being influenced by the Occupy Wall Street movement. I don't believe it for one minute. There is nothing in any of these songs that capture that media-made moment. The characters in these songs are the same type of people that have populated Springsteen's songs since at least The River, and bear no similarity to the over-educated politically- charged young \\"hippies\\"  in that movement. I think Bruce -though obviously sympathetic to their aims-tried to tie in his new album to that event in an attempt to seem more revelant, more topical.  He needn't have bothered. Wrecking Ball stands on it's own as an often powerful, sometimes pedestrian album by an artist whose vision of America as a flawed experiment that often struggles to  live up to it's promise mirrors  his own career.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|horrid contols.  played a lot of these games.  didnt hit a pin for the first five frames.  no clue why.  no instruction (shouldn't need any).  I'm hoping that its just the phone or something.  evo 4g
B0071PS7AC|5.0|I am very picky what apps I put on my Kindle Fire. With 365 free apps a year you don't need to get every one. Out of the past 100 this is in the top 10. Great app. Keep up the good work.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|No other word can truly express how I felt about this movie.  This is an unthrilling thriller of the lowest common denominator.  I knew within the first few minutes what kind of movie this was going to be.  Completely unlikable characters who are scripted to use the f bomb for every line they say makes one so depressed about the state our screen writers are in these days.  Not only that but they were terribly clich'ed as well, led by a big nosed phone his lines in Liam Neeson.  Their is no way Mr. Neeson read this script and these characters and thought it would make a convincing or entertaining story.  My opinion of Liam Neeson has dropped considerably after seeing this movie,  thats how bad it was.  So everyone is firmiliar with the story by now so I wont go into great detail about it.  All I can say is that I despised the characters so much that I found myself rooting for the computer animated wolves.  The worst offence this film commits is its attempt to be profound.  Really! you are really going to try and be deep and philisophical about life and the existence of god with a movie Steven Segal would problaly have passed on.  Thats right we get a whole embarrassing scene of Neeson swearing out god and deciding to go after the computer animated wolves by himself.  Q one of The most unexciting finales in a movie ever.  The movie was beautiful to look at, however, the sheer amount of expetives severly detracted from the films visual beauty.  I can liken it to taking a road trip during fall or spring with that friend who has a barrel of full swear jars at home. The only scary thing about this peice of garbage was the hard earned money I spent to see it.  The Grey is further proof that just because a big name signs on does not mean its going to be a qaulity film.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|Wow!  What a deal.  I am Dickens lover from way back in high school and this satisfies my love of this wonderful author.  To have them all at my fingertips for such a small price is fantastic.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Lego Creator Volkswagen T1 Camper Van 10220 is absolutely phantastic! Crisp and Tight like Mike and Trey at Telluride 2010. The Van is exceptionally detailed, much like a Brent Mydland/Garcia solo without the burnout. The Lego Beatle had a hard time making it across the midwest in the hot summer sun, but the Lego T1 Volkswagen delivers like Further piloted by Neal Cassidy! Already going down as one of the best shows in history, the Lego Creator Volkswagen T1 Camper Van is straight from soundboard, this one is not be missed. Nothing like some good R&R after a long days drive and a long night of dancing on the lawn! Remember kids, the tires are the things on your Lego T1 Camper Van that make contact with the road!<br /><br />The Lego creator Volkswagen T1 Camper Van is a Lego classic. If you are reading this review, and get what I am saying, you need this Lego.<br /><br />Keep that Truckin on!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I play this type of games on my Pc but since I've got my kindle I thought I would give it a try. Needless to say I have no regrets. The graphics are good and the puzzles are challenging. I loved playing this game &amp; I would reccomend it if you like games of this type.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|like it for a lil min, but with some many glitches its kills a classic game of dominoes and i have been playing it a while
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down and when it was finished, I was so riveted, I had to buy book 3, which I am almost finished reading--great series. I will be looking at her books with renewed interest!!!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is definitely one of the greatest films ever made. If you have never watched this, you should definitely watch.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|I can't really knock the app. Pin action seems realistic. Ball control is fairly intuitive. Straight finger stroke throws a straight ball.  A stroke ending with a sideways swipe, throws a hook. Lane action is good. Graphics are fine.<br /><br />My problem is that it seems like it would be hard to progress in this app, even on a Kindle Fire's larger screen. I was a decent league bowler (around 170), throwing a 16 pound ball with a conventional hook delivery. From that general perspective, I can attest to the app's overall integrity.<br /><br />That being said, however, I was only able the throw in the low 100s. I lost faith in ever being able the throw a consistent hook and simply tried straight balls from various angles. Washouts and baby splits seemed at tad too frequent.<br /><br />UPDATE***  Tried program by cheating.  If you drag your finger all the way back, the ball releases in a straight line, right where it is lined up; normal spares become easy.  One board to the right, you usually strike.  First game using this method resulted in 8 strikes and 2 spares.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I still think the game might be fun if you don't cheat.  Give it a try.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Having seen the play several times and the film, I was curious to see if Phantom could be made even better...IT WAS!  The Royal Albert Hall performance was outstanding!  The sound, the performers and the costumes were exceptional.  I am more than happy with my purchase, and would encourage who loves Phantom to own a copy of this show!
B007CKB2AS|5.0|I'm already on my third play thru of this album and I've only had it for 2 hours. Bruce and the band still cut to the core of things, calling the dark times for what they are, a Depression. But this is more than just an indictment of those who've brought death to our hometowns, it's a voice that's angry and low yet not beaten by a game that's been rigged by the few against the many. This is a wrecking ball and Bruce knows just how to swing it.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|A perfect unit for its size and price. I used to build my own amps but that was actually more expensive and all my Chumoy project doesn't sound better than this...<br /><br />Based on other review, every detail on this little amp makes perfect sense it its user. I have a Yamaha RH5MA which is a little bit hard to push. On this unit, a big improvement! Especially if I use my Ipod Touch 2nd Line out.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who has a headphone that needs more power.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|Movie came incredibly quick. First view/inspection shows nothing wrong with disc. Its a hilarious film that I highly recommend. Can't go wrong with a family flick like this!
B006T5FDLG|3.0|Still the same Metallica that's been restrained since the black CD. I loved the older music, but they seem calculated and restrained since then. :-(<br />These 4 songs could have been left off altogether. They seem to almost go to the hard rocking style that made them famous, but falls short.<br />Jeff
B00751K174|5.0|Love this show  will buy the seasons  really got into the story, love the characters  will keep watching hope everyone else enjoys it too
B004W89N72|2.0|similar to what others wrote. I uninstalled very quickly after getting it. I would ask for a refund if you paid.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is tons of fun.  I like how you have to earn points to open new games. it is a challenge.
098478280X|5.0|This book is the book to prepare for a technical interview. Many questions that were asked to me were covered in the book.. Definitely got me an edge in preparation over other candidates. Also the book has nice sections about what to expect, what not to expect.. Overall, reading it alleviated a lot of my stress and gave me a positive attitude towards the process wich got me an offer! Less cheaper than a textbook!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed watching this DVD. Ramin Karimloo plays the Phantom really well, i can feel every emotion he has and it is truly breathtaking. Sierra Boggess does a great job as Christine. In my honest opinion i feel Emmy Rossum in the 2004 film of Phantom did the innocent \\"deer in the headlights\\" look better, but that is because she was at the right age. I was introduced to the Phantom by Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum playing the main roles and i never thought i would find two people better than them to play the role. Ramin and Sierra have perfect chemistry and amazing voices. I still love Gerard and Emmy more, but Ramin and Sierra are very close on my scale to them.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun way to pass time...trying to get enough points to unlock all the games......my kids love it also.....hoping that more levels come out soon
B0071PS7AC|1.0|This is a bad game don't get it controls are bad Cpu is too good and always too much spin starts the game when u open da app don't get it its poop
B006C45MRE|3.0|...if you don't get your hopes up. It's a serviceable distraction. Daniel Craig is stiff, Olivia Wilde is hot and Harrison Ford is iconic in a clich&eacute; kinda way. If you're into popcorn you'll wreck a bag or bowl or whatever but you won't be left exactly stressed out.<br /><br />If it isn't obvious, I did get my hopes up because I did the math and the sum of the parts is much more than what this is. On the other hand, if you take this review to heart you'll probably enjoy it more than I did.

1609611543|5.0|I first learned about Wheat Belly back in September 2011 in Northern California.  My friend Seamus was eating some chili out of a can while we were waiting for our class at a seminar to start.  I asked him why he was doing that and he said, \\"You gotta read this book called Wheat Belly!\\"<br /><br />After he explained what the book was about, how quickly and dramatically his situation improved (his digestion turned around very quickly!), it made total sense why he was eating chili out of a can even though we had plenty of food served (most of it had some form of wheat in it!).<br /><br />I immediately downloaded the book off Amazon and finished reading it on my way back home to Hawaii and my view on food had totally shifted.  Life would never be the same again!<br /><br />I knew eating bread would contribute to weight gain, however learning about all the OTHER information about the hybridization, the Gliadin, and all the blood sugar, inflammation, digestive, and neurological effects, OMG!!!<br /><br />I am a massage therapist and part of a family business and now it is clear why we have so many people coming in with so many aches, pains, & injuries from seemingly routine activities.  It is clear to me that consuming a diet with wheat, triggers inflammation, creates all sots of systemic problems and their bodies are no longer able to tolerate typical activities.<br /><br />I realize why I'm seeing more clients not responding to our techniques that used to work well.  The techniques are great, however the clients that are coming in are unhealthier than ever with rampant inflammation, pre diabetic / diabetic, high cholesterol, nervous systems interfered with by gliadin, overweight, etc etc etc.<br /><br />All of our clients who have made the transition to wheat free have lost weight, have more energy, and most of the joint pains and stiffness have gone away and their massage treatments are enjoyable again and we aren't putting out fires anymore!<br /><br />It is our responsibility to share and let everyone know in order to create change.  Our friends & family will continue to see their health degrade if they continue on this path.  It will cost us all.<br /><br />Get 5 copies of this book and share it with everyone!  I just ordered 5 more and will be assigning homework to my clients!
0545425115|5.0|Great book!  Author Suzanne Collins combines a futuristic sci-fi setting with an interesting page-turner plot which really moves to offer reading pleasure well into the night. Her novel creates a unique, richly imagined stunning fantasy world. It's a survival tale which takes place in a scientifically engineered arena of enormous proportions into which twenty- four young people aged 12-18 are placed to serve as tributes. These \\"losers\\"  are the \\"winners\\" of random selections held in their provinces along with occasional volunteers. While twenty four must compete to survive, the survival odds are extreme since the rules determine only a single victor will emerge to survive the ordeal.<br /><br />  The building blocks the author uses to create her futuristic ( and horrific) world include ideas clearly rooted in ancient traditions: spectator sports held in arenas, Olympic competitions between city-states,  people offered up as tributes to conquering nations by vanquished nations, and gladiators who survive only by winning fights to the death . Another recognizable literary theme Collins adapts is that of human prey evading and escaping human hunters. Collins makes her imaginary brave new world unique by combining these recognizable elements derived from the past with modern concepts of control:genetic engineering, environmental engineering and technical monitoring.<br /><br />  The extreme survival ordeal brings out the very best and the worst in human nature. Amidst all the horror and bloodshed,  Collins creates several very likable and very human characters who respond by revealing some wonderful character traits. This  maintains our interest and makes us keep on reading to learn their fates. The Hunger Games movie is due for release later this month, with some trailers already out there. This is a unique, interesting, and creative book which provides great source material for the film. I'm eager to see how the movie director cast the characters and the staged  the special effect of scenes with great cinematic potential: the fiery chariot entrance,the competitors' multiple carefully crafted designer costumes, the arena's genetically modified animals, and the arena's evening reports projected into the night sky to memorialize the fallen and to update the surviving competitors.

0307956350|4.0|Built on the sturdy foundation of deception, the Expats is a cat and mouse tale of long held secrets and double lives where it's difficult to tell the players without a scorecard.  With as many twists and turns as a certain well known street in San Francisco and travelogue type descriptions of far away places, author Chris Pavone takes you on a vicarious, intricately plotted adventure down the streets of locales like Luxembourg, Paris and Amsterdam as wife and mother, Kate Moore futilely attempts to keep her past from colliding with the present.  Little does Kate know that she is not the only one playing \\"I've got a secret.\\"<br /><br />Pavone's characters are alive on the page and the reader becomes part of the adventure while travelling along with Kate as she tries to sift through her memories and use valuable lessons from her past to unravel the suspicious actions and underlying motivation of everyone from her husband to a couple of friends who seem to keep popping up at every turn.  One small hint to readers, the secret to truly enjoying this book will lie in your ability to keep track of the \\"today\\" scenario as the novel moves back and forth in time.<br /><br />If you happen to be a fan of the early works of Robert Ludlum this intriguing book should be moved to the top of your TBR list.  Don't be surprised if Hollywood decides that Kate Moore is the new Jason Bourne and Angelina the new Kate Moore.<br />3 1/2 stars.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This app is soooo addicting. I love it so much. I recommend it to anybody who loves games that are fun... and never ending! You have to get this app!! Just DO IT!!
B007H51DQG|1.0|I think that the other reviews pretty much sum up how I feel. This show isn't even about zombies any more, it's just about petty drama stitched together terribly. This used to be my favorite show, but I give up. I'm not going to make excuses for it any more. It's not going to get any better. Good job on ruining a great idea AMC. Shouldn't have fired Darabont.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I LOVED these books, I fell in love with Christian and Ana. To be honest, I never wanted the books to end, I could have read 5 more of these books..  =) Very well written E L James, I can't wait to read more of you're books in the future. Give these books a chance, you won't be disappointed.
0439023491|5.0|If you've got this far in the trilogy, you know you'll have to read all three books before you can stop. The second book picks up where the first left off and starts answering some of the questions we were left with at the end of the first. We get deeper inside the characters we fell in love with and we find that, once again, no one is safe. The plotting is just as intense as in the first, and it very quickly ramps up even more. Just like the first book, I couldn't put this one down. And, as expected, when I got to the end, I quickly grabbed the third in the trilogy.<br /><br />Collins really impressed me with her writing style and with her plotting. It was her characters, both major and minor, that grabbed my heart and never let go.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|This has to be one of the best if not the very best railroad movie in many years. The action starts at the beginning and never stops. It is one you will want to see over and over. The first time I saw it I found myself on the edge of my seat and very tense just wondering what unbelievable thing would happen next. The acting is great from all actors and the special effects will blow your mind.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my best friend talked me into getting this, and now I am really happy I got it! it keeps you playing!
B001UV4XFG|2.0|This seems like a copy of the real product. In the back instead of reading proof of purchase by summit it only reads proof of purchase... I have all the movies and I just wanted to have the original eclipse because I have the blue-ray version, all my other movies have summit writen in the barcode. Other than that the service was super fast.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This movie was hilarious. I am a big fan of Alan Tudyk (of Firefly/Serenity fame) but chose to watch based on Katrina Bowden's appearance. A definite must for horror comedy buffs!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It is a really good Bible app but the scripture changing could be better.  Make it where all you have to do is select the book an chapter.  Also a Concordance would be nice.  Either that or find a way to speed up the search function.
0451209338|3.0|This is Daniel Silva's first Gabriel Allon novel, and I read it immediately after reading his very first novel, a WWII spy thriller called \\"The Unlikely Spy.\\" It is a page turner, no question about it, but at its conclusion, Silva uses a plot device that he also used in \\"The Unlikely Spy.\\" Giving away the device would spoil the ending, so I won't describe it, but it didn't work there, and it doesn't work here. In his effort to add just one more twist, Silva spoils the story and makes you ask, what was the point? I'll go on to read at least one more in this series, but you have to be a great fan to not coming away a bit disappointed with this effort.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|Vegas Bowling is a really good bowling app that uses realistic physics, I also like that you get to see your opponent's avatars in the game, a nice touch!  Please keep this in mind, like any decent game, you do need to read the directions (look in the Help file) and practice, practice, practice!<br /><br />This game is not unwinable, you can beat this game, if you practice enough, I bowl in real life and the ball in the game does act like my real ball (though the controls take some getting used to) and have scored 149-279 every game I've played so far on my device.<br /><br />The Mulligan Strike (single frame 0-10 (gutter ball/spare) counting as a strike instead of a spare) may be intentional or a glitch, that all depends on which Bowling Rules Set is being used in this game.  Yes, there really are other rules for bowling outside of the commonly known and used rules, just look at poker for a great example of this in action!<br /><br />If the Mulligan Strike is not a glitch, but deliberate, I wish there was an option to get rid of it (add a checkbox to use the standard rules instead) just to cut down on the pointless complaints!<br /><br />A few other things that could improve this game are: Multi-player, more than one human player (named of course) so my friends can play against both the computer and myself, &quot;I'm up?  Pass the device please!&quot;  That would make this a fun party game.  Average Tracking, just like you do in real life.  Track my winnings overall, I'd like to see how much I've won/lost and against who.  A way to increase the difficulty for when the game gets too easy.  And last, things to spend my winnings on, new balls, bowling bags, wrist braces etc.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are other things that could be added to Vegas Bowling to improve it, and I hope that the kind Devs that brought this game to us will consider implementating at least some of these suggestions in the near future.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a very good bowling game and I believe it worth the purchase price if you weren't lucky enough to catch it as the FAotD.owling game and I believe it worth the purchase price if you weren't lucky enough to catch it as the FAotD.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game makes me wonder if i missed out for a career in grocery bagology. it takes a simple concept, applies some cute, well rendered graphics, clever sounds, and satisfying gameplay. this is my fav android game so far.
0553801473|2.0|Haven't started reading this yet, but with 2/3 of the reviews giving it 3 stars or less and blaming it on bad writing in books four and five I doubt if I will take the time to even start. Author please note that some people will be influenced by the opinion of others
B0071PS7AC|4.0|Other than not having complete control of the ball, (as in Real Life)...this is a pretty good game!  Especially for the price!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The very best book I have read in a long time!!! I enjoyed as much or more than the Harry Potter series, but the trilogy wasn't as long as Harry Potter. Interesting and inspirational.[[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]]
B001DUJNGS|4.0|Enigma's always been in my top 3 favorites and I found this CD to be a very good album, although I do like some of their previous music a bit better I still enjoyed this album quite a bit.  If you're 'new' to Enigma's music I would first recommend either Love, Sensuality, Devotion, A Posteriori, or MCMXC a.D.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Considering I purchased this for only $25 and had free shipping, it was very much worth the money. If I had to have paid full price, however, it would feel rather overpaid. The construction is decent, and it's very light weight due to being full plastic. It creaks a bit when you're moving it around on your head but seems to be solid enough. The fabric used for the padding can get a bit itchy if you wear them an extended period (I tend to wear them on and off throughout the day as I work from home on the PC and game while on voice chat), but overall it's soft and the padding is sufficiently comfortable. The mic is great quality, I have no problem with background noise or not being heard, even if I'm speaking from a few feet away while it's not on my head. The rotation and way the boom fits into the main body is also very well thought out and constructed (the ear cups also rotate a bit on a ball joint which is useful). As far as audio goes, at low volumes it tends to sound a bit weak, but once you pump it up a bit (I'm not a fan of ear-blasting volume as I still have great hearing, but I like to feel the bass in my music at least) it sounds good. Compared to my old Sony MDR700DJ headphones, it's pretty comparable and much more comfortable. All in all a great low cost headset.
B0054JELS4|1.0|I love NCIS so I bought the complete set so I could watch them from beginning to end.  I have only gotten to the second season and I have already found that 2 discs in season 1 were mislabeled and discs 3 and 4 from season 2 are blank and don't play at all.  I'm scared to find out what happens in the next 6 seasons.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|at this time I cannot give an accurate review, because I have been busy...but I will be glad to add additional info when I am able to read this product.  Thanks for the free reads.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is easy to use and encourages even a quick read. it works better than the e-book version of the Bible on my Kindle!
0671027344|4.0|Man, did I love this book when I was in high school. I bought it when it first came out, and still have that copy today. I recently re-read it and was surprised by two things: 1. How much I remembered after 10 years and 2. How much I completely forgot.<br /><br />Now I see why this book is so popular. It has pretty much every single YA trope in it: drugs, first kiss, sexual abuse, dealing with sexuality, teen pregnancy, abortion, distant parents, making friends, bullying, suicide, and melting your hand with molten silver until it's a creepy flipper like that of Oswald Cobblepot, aka The Penguin. Okay, that last one might be from Johnny Tremain, but all the rest is in there, and probably a half-dozen more I forgot.<br /><br />I think the reason I forgot so much of the book, was that when I first read the book at sixteen, I just chose the parts I identified with and pretty much discarded the rest. Kind of like picking the marshmallows out of a bowl of Lucky Charms and tossing the cereal. Because I wasn't into drugs as a teenager, I didn't remember that the characters were high half the time.<br /><br />That whole pick-and-choose method isn't part of my reading strategy anymore. As a result, I didn't care for the book as much upon re-reading it. And I found the narrator extremely tiring.<br /><br />Plus, the whole book comes across as a little false, like an adult writing letters pretending to be a teenager (which is exactly what the book really is.) Charlie talks about how he needs to learn grammar, punctuation, and spelling, but his writing is pretty much flawless. That may seem like a nitpick, but it's hard to think you're reading letters from a teenager when they're written in perfect English. Most adults don't write that well.<br /><br />Because the book tries so hard to cater to everyone, it just feel spectacularly average. The upside is that there is something, at least one little thing, in here for practically every one.<br /><br />This adult re-reader gives this book three stars; the emo teen still inside me somewhere (I really shouldn't have eaten him) gave it five; so I've averaged that out to four.is book three stars; the emo teen still inside me somewhere (I really shouldn't have eaten him) gave it five; so I've averaged that out to four.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use would highly recommend to anyone. never had problems that I read other people complaining about in reviews.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|The people rating this game must have horrible coordination! Its tricky, but not hard. Just look at the instructions! If you have played any bowling game before you should be able to get the hang of it quick. That being said, not a real interesting game, but a good time waster. Great fore a doctors office waiting room.
B002HL3PN4|2.0|Rented video from amazon.com because my girlfriend had never seen it.  She was actually showing interest in the story when in the middle it stopped.  No idea why and couldn't be fixed.  Pretty sure no one is going to read this and provide a refund so I'll also ask for a personal stimulus package that will pay off my student loans, a rickenbacker 360 blue burst 6 string, and a monkey.  And a case of Sierra Nevada pale ale.  Go Pens.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I came across this 2011 version of Jane Eyre by accident. As I was watching the movie my eyes would glance at the clock and wonder how they were going to fit all the needed scenes into this movie.  You can not see a Jane Eyre movie in 2 hours. That being said I believe the chemistry between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester was the best out of the previous versions. After the burning bed seen I could not wait to see more of that chemistry.<br /><br />It was not to be seen the movie went by so fast that useless you had seen previous versions you would have been lost as to what was happening. Let's cross our fingers maybe there is a longer version.<br /><br />Cross fingers
1469984202|5.0|I was truly taken aback midway through the first paragraph of Wool.  This piece of work was far beyond the usual self published works on Amazon and holds it's own with my favorite novels.  I've recommended this to everyone I know and have purchased the entire Hugh Howely collection.  I've never been more excited to read additional works by a single author...this story is THAT good.
0525478817|4.0|The Fault in Our Stars seemed to travel on an inverted roller coaster. This I due to a less interesting and at times slow moving middle section. However, many of the moments and dialogue in this section are key to the final points the author makes and the occasional dull passages are worth this message. Augustus and Hazel speak very poetically and philosophically, with a somewhat larger than average vocabulary for teenagers. This, and their at times cynical attitudes, can be overlooked given their age and situation.<br />Being a fan of John Green, I was a bit nervous to see his often light-hearted backdrops replaced with a dark and looming sky. The serious setting leaves the reader looking for an inspirational and heartwarming story, which Augustus, Hazel and others do not disappoint to deliver.
B000002OZY|5.0|Simply a masterpiece.  Arrangements on certain songs are classic ( overture\underture) !!  A must have for any serious collection.  Pete Townsend set the bar so high with this work of art...
B001BKG9SK|5.0|This is an excellent buy. The music is great and so are the DVDs. I would reccomend this to all Pink Floyd & David Gilmor fans!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for when your bored and just want to waste some time...and the locked games will get you addicted into opening them....
1439116881|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who knows of a person with Alzheimers. It makes you cry and laugh at the same time.
0062060562|5.0|I must say that I had no idea what I was buying and had never heard of it.  I was on vacation in Mexico and had finished the book I brought to read on the beach.  I found this in the gift shop.  For the rest of the day, my husband was on his own as I could not put it down.  There were a few times I was ready for the change I knew was coming to happen but other than that, I found it to be quite the page turner and was completely surprised with the ending.  I brought the book back with me instead of leaving it at the resort for the next vacationer to pick up and gave it to a woman I work with as she is also an avid reader.  She also said that it had been a long time since she read a book that she couldn't put down.  She was done the next day and it went to someone else in the office who responded to it the same as both of us.  This little paperback is now making it's rounds and I am being applauded for having found it.  I am writing this because I went on Amazon to see if he had written anything else I could scoop up.  I hope the author is not a one hit wonder because I am really looking forward to his next book.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|When you can score a 300 on your second game, then the game is way too easy. You don't even need you curve the ball. Just aim a little off center.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|Terrible controls.  This is definitely the worse bowling game that I have ever played.  Even free is overpriced on this one.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is a singer. Wow, isn't it weird to say that? In today's society, so many performers have to utilize auto tune and various vocal manipulation tools to even get a record out on the market. Adele doesn't have to do that, she has raw talent, which is for the most part sadly missing in most of popular music today.<br /><br />Her voice is like one from the past. It is haunting and beautiful. She isn't over-rated, simply put, her voice is one of the best in music. She swept all of her categories at the grammys and \\"21\\" has remained at the top of the charts for over a year. All of the singles released from this album have also hit number one on the billboard chart.<br /><br />I haven't listened to the entire album because the very first song \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" is so catchy and so compelling.. it's hard to top. As are \\"Fire to the Rain\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\". I haven't been disappointed and you won't either.
B006O5XYWG|3.0|My friend recommended this to me with a five star review, but I was not impressed. The story was weakly believable, but weaker than I expected. I wanted to believe, to immerse myself and enjoy the show, but the story was too weak and contrived.<br /><br />None of the characters possessed the power of an individual who has a soul. I drifted away from the picture, thinking about other things. Cesar gained my pity, but not my sympathy, never my admiration. The humans were mere cardboard cut-outs, a backdrop to the apes, and the caretakers of the ape sanctuary in San Bruno were mere goons. I know it is just a movie, but I couldn't swallow that: Bay area activists would have protested and media would have headlined until that place was shut down. Some of the action episodes brought me back, but this was just an action flick, and not a very good action flick at that. The final action sequence was ridiculous, and I was annoyed by the filmmaker's attempt to get the audience cheering for the apes as they face down the police.<br /><br />The production was professional, in that current Hollywood manner, where all of the good guys are attractive and their homes stunningly beautiful. It doesn't innovate, or dare to challenge the current correct thinking (animals are good, humans are bad). The scenes in the ape sanctuary were very dark on my home system, which may have been mood lighting, but made it difficult to see what was happening at times.<br /><br />I barely remember the original Planet of the Apes movies, which played when I was very young. This has been called a worthy successor to that lineage, and I can't argue, because I suspect those old movies wouldn't play well to modern audiences, myself included. This movie did well at the box office, and some younger people I spoke with liked it, so I guess we will be seeing some sequels.
0316017922|5.0|I loved this book!Found it very mind-opening and highly recommend it to anyone. Can't wait for the next book this author will write.

B0071PS7AC|3.0|Ehh, this game is okay. At first, I had no idea how to play; no instructions. But then, I realized you pull back to release. It would've been helpful if it actually said that instead of you having to figure it out. And last, it's not all that fun. That's why I gave it 3 stars.
0307957934|2.0|Based on  a couple of his other novels I really liked, I expected a lot from 'The Fear Index'. Boy, was I disappointed. Bad character development, unlikable characters, a plot that seemed interesting for awhile but then took a bad turn, and very pedestrian writing. The story has the feel of being a partially developed idea that the author just sort of plowed his way through without doing much research or polishing his prose.<br /><br />If you're a techie, you'll probably find many targets to mock, likewise if you're a financial person. I can deal with the occasional error if there's a great story or fantastic writing, but this had neither.
B000056NX5|5.0|This was my first experience with this movie and I find it a very bravura performance by Glenn Carter.  His fantastic acting and singing brings the story to life.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants to enjoy a great experience.
1401307787|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from a meditation website. I was interested in meditation to learn more about it. Other books i had glanced over seemed really difficult to understand. Websites seemed to state different things that made it hard for me to understand what meditation even was.<br /><br />I received this book and WOW. It starts so basically that all you need to be able to do i read English. You don't need to have any idea what meditation is. You can follow any religion as this is not religious. It is so basic to begin with and as you read it builds up your understanding as you go.<br /><br />The parts that you try yourself seem to pop up at the exact right time, just when you have that question in your mind . Perfect for anyone interested in mediation and mindfulness without any pre-conceived notions about what or how it is.
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|Well, after watching this all I can say is... Thank you, dear Lord, that my mother had the forethought to check it out of the library instead of buying it. This is easily the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre in existence. Here are my complaints-<br /><br />First (aka 'Dude, where's the cameraman'): if I had to watch one more scene where Mia paced or walked aimlessly in a circle I probably would have screamed.<br /><br />Second (aka 'The dog ate my script'): They left out key parts of the original Jane Eyre dialogue and added pieces that do not sound in keeping with period. Not that it much mattered since everything was spoken monotone, so as not to wake any of the audience up.<br /><br />Third (see title): The entire movie felt like the cliff notes version of Jane Eyre. For all the length of the movie (and believe me, it was endless), it felt like there was no pause between Jane's \\"Hello I'm the governess\\" and Mr. Rochester's \\"Hey babe let's get married.\\", leaving anyone who had never read the book before to believe that Jane is only after him for his money and Mr. Rochester must be desperate. Honestly, the only thing that could have saved this movie from itself was if Mrs. Rochester really did turn into a vampire and killed them all.
B003AO1SVS|1.0|Shouldn't a CD that you pay money for sound better than, or at least as good as, a live performance on TV?  This one doesn't.<br /><br />Ordered two CD's the same day, two different artists, two different labels.  They both sound bad.  Maybe most of the market these days is downloads and cheap ear buds, but it couldn't cost much more to put a decent recording on a CD.<br /><br />Here's an idea:  Maybe Amazon could have a separate review rating for Sound Quality on the CD's.
B004XIQIPQ|5.0|This album, although being nothing like their first 3 albums epitomizes the return to form of this fantastic band. 'Humbug' despite having the odd great song did not have the consistency of this album. The whole album is more mellow than any of its predecessors with fantastic songs such as 'Black Treacle' and 'Piledriver Waltz', meanwhile there are other great songs to be found such as 'Suck it and See' and 'She's Thunderstorms'. Anyone who has written a unfavorable review cannot have given this album a proper or second listen as I honestly rate this as one of my favorite albums, but then again that is the point of the album title 'Suck it and See' meaning that you should try it and see what you think. I personally think this is a phenomenal album!

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />Immersive new world (this is a huge complement. Don't take it as a small thing).<br />Sanderson's light prose which allows us to delve into the experience rather than the writing<br />Those little hints that make us want to read the next<br /><br />Cons:<br />1 of the 3 main characters is one-dimensional.  You know what will happen next.<br />1000 pages and not much action<br /><br />Great job on a new start.<br /><br />P.S.  B. Sanderson is an avid MTG player.  I always like to think that the game had an influence on his world creation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is really fun. The thing that makes it so awesome is that there are so many games in one app, and it is, like, the only app you need cause there is such a variety if games. I love this app!
B003DT194G|5.0|This film is the continental European version of the 'state of nature' that was America before government.<br /><br />The music stems from the Wagnerian leitmotif. The characters are all beasts of prey vying for mastery of the control of resources, the primordial aristocrats battling for supremacy of will.<br /><br />The revenge motive is more powerfully captured in this film than in any I have ever seen.<br /><br />In the Top ten films of all time, imo.
0802798225|4.0|(3.5)<br /><br />I think most weight in the story leaned on Alex being in a gang. Since it's a baggaged topic and usually poorly portrayed, I was looking to read about it from another angle and I do find that Elkeles succeeded with what she put on the table. I know I was immersed in it.<br /><br />I'd say `Perfect Chemistry' is a classic story about forbidden love - two people from completely different worlds with only a wall between, thrust together and having to deal. It's not exactly something you haven't seen before and the plot involving the bet and how that was going to play itself out was beyond predictable, but I'd like to give all credit to Alex's character for being the main interesting concept. Yes, I'm actually going to do that.<br /><br />Sure, the bad boy thing is really taking over the world of YA but Elkeles gives so many sides and layers to Alex and makes you go through all of them with him. There was his cocky/confident/sexy side and his vulnerable/shielded/trapped one - you went from rolling your eyes at him to sympathizing with him.<br />I'm not on a roll with heroines lately and I haven't got much to say about Brittany. There wasn't anything that made me recognize Brittany or her personality. She was average, bland.<br /><br />I've previously mentioned that I'm not big on love stories extending for too long (several months or more) because it easily gives the impression that the story never gets to the point, of if it skips for longer periods makes you feel like you've missed out on a lot material. But with `Perfect Chemistry' I didn't really notice it as a whole. Okay, admittingly, I was slightly bothered by the \\"five months later..\\" but quickly got over it. I actually liked that there was a good build-up to Alex and Brittany and a detailed execution.<br /><br />It's so fulfilling feeling like the journey a story has taken you on has come a long way and that's exactly how I felt about `Perfect Chemistry'.<br /><br />Will I read more from the author? Surekly got over it. I actually liked that there was a good build-up to Alex and Brittany and a detailed execution.<br /><br />It's so fulfilling feeling like the journey a story has taken you on has come a long way and that's exactly how I felt about `Perfect Chemistry'.<br /><br />- Review taken from my YA book review blog: LITTLE PAPER ROSE on Blogspot!

B001P9EQH8|5.0|So many reviews here speak of using this for music etc but I actually bought this due to my nerve deafness.  I can hear many sounds, but often with movies, the speaking parts are too low so that it is not enjoyable to watch movies or tv shows as I can hear them speaking but cannot make out the majority of the words.<br /><br />I actually bought this for use with Amazon Prime since they do not have CC (Closed Captioning).  This unit is the only amp I have ever bought for use with my headsets so I cannot make comparisons, but for amplifying volume so that I can actually hear the dialogue, this unit is FANTASTIC!  In fact, for Prime shows, it is so loud, I have it on the lowest setting to hear comfortably!  For movies elsewhere on the Net, I've had to crank it up a few notches for those that were ranked a low score due to low volume but I hear everything!<br /><br />I do not hear any hissing, pops or anything that some other reviewers have complained about but then again, maybe their better hearing picks up these imperfections.  I do not hear them however.  The unit normally goes for $30 but w prime it is discounted about $10.  I bought it before I had Prime back in June 2011 and it was worth all $30!  One thing I do notice is that it works best with a headset with one jack and can be a little glitchy with headsets with mic/headphone dual jacks - sometimes it works with duals and sometimes it doesn't so be aware of this.<br /><br />The unit is small- about the size of a paper matchbook, is very light in weight but made of high quality material.  The surface is slippery and the clip is sturdy but slippery also so it may have trouble actually staying in place.  My advice is to clip it on the inside of a pocket so that the clip is on the outside and the unit in.  A small strip of velcro taped to a backpack pocket would make it more secure.  It charges via USB within an hour if fully drained and lasts quite a few hours of constant use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this unit if you have nerve deafness or are hard of hearing for whatever reason.<br /><br />UPDATE: June 27, 2012<br />I bought a used 8GB iPod 4th gen and some of the music files already on the iPod were transferred in low volume.  I added this amp in between the iPod and the headset and was able to hear even the faintest of songs in great volume so the only songs I took off the iPod were the ones not of my taste and not due to an inability of hearing thanks to this item!  I also bought the latest FiiO E6 to have the FiiO E5 as a backup and the E6 is better than this one due to more sound selections (i.e. more bass etc) but both work great. :)<br /><br />UPDATE: December 10, 2013<br />I still use both the E5 & E6 with my iPod 4th Gen.  They work just as they did on day one. However, I do not use them for my Samsung G3 phone due to the quirkiness of its headphone jack based on so many reviews.  I opted instead to use a Bluetooth headset with my phone.  To help with my nerve deafness, I purchased the Equalizer app from the Playstore and it acts as if I was using this physical amp.  This update doesn't exactly refer to this product but I wanted to add it for those that are hard of hearing and are finding it difficult to hear via Bluetooth headsets.
B007D5DUBG|5.0|I didn't think they could top themselves after Light Me Up simply because of Make Me Wanna Die, Zombie and Miss Nothing.  But this has them bringing a bit more mature sound to mix.  Taylor's voice has always veered on the bluesy side to me and she lets you know it with these songs.  Much smoother sound and feel. I'm really loving Under The Water but all the songs are so great.  It's good to see the band evolving and hope to see much more from them in the future.
1466401885|3.0|`Beautiful Disaster' sure was interesting. It's a story about unlikely love. How two very different people can connect through unlikely events and unlikely times in their lives. It's the hungry and craving kind of love. McGuire has done an excellent job of boldly pushing the limits and just about (barely) working around the fear that comes with having someone be so addicted to you.<br /><br />I was astonished by how much I liked Abby. Her voice was plain, very safe. She might as well still be a stranger by the end of the book, but it actually suited as a nice contrast to the intensity in everything around her. Though, there were definitely moments you wished to have been able to just sit her down and ask her if she's even thinking properly.<br /><br />As for Travis - oh, dear god. I'm impressed McGuire dared go there and create such an intense and somewhat \\"taboo\\" character. I can see why people are attracted to the bad boy type but Travis' drinking and smoking, carelessly sleeping around, the violence, the red hot temper.. it was a bit overboard for me to still have him supposedly be a charming guy that all girls lust for.<br /><br />He loves and needs Abby in such a controlling and dangerously overpowering way. Reading about Travis was like walking on eggshells, you're just constantly waiting and expecting him to snap.<br />I was afraid McGuire would take it too far but I'm glad she still meant for it to be about love and, at the end of the day, (which I can't believe) she succeeded maintaining some attraction to him.<br /><br />McGuire worked Abby, Travis, America, and Shepley's friendship as a group very well. I definitely enjoyed reading about the four interacting.<br />There were lots of new-thinking, outside the box, and interesting ideas in the story. The book has a quick pace, changing scenarios with good speed, never leaving you bored with what's going on.<br /><br />'Beautiful Disaster' is an extremely conflicted, frustrating story, and definitely worth a read for the sake of the giant wave of emotion that'll come your way.<br /><br />Loved it? No<br />Regret reading it? No<br />Will I read more from the author? Surethat'll come your way.    Loved it? No  Regret reading it? No  Will I read more from the author? Sure
B001AVCFJM|5.0|i bought this video and it was amazing, came on the time predicted and video works well. two disc, the second disc has the bloopers, deleted scenes and etc.<br /><br />i definitely do recommend buying from this seller.  on the other hand star trek was an amazing movie in general.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast read. This book brought forth a long, free ranging discussion of cultures at our book club and how our tween children were responding to it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I rely on this for everyday weather reports.  I deliver mail so it helps me know how to plan my clothing and drive to work.
0142419400|3.0|I'll be blunt and say it was.. okay.<br /><br />I was definitely not blown away by it nor was I disappointed. To me, it was one of those stories you read, finish, and don't think much about it.<br />There wasn't anything extraordinary about the plot, it was pretty much an in the range typical girl-likes-boy situation only Perkins added boarding school and Paris which I can imagine made the story much more appealing and interesting.<br /><br />A novel set in a foreign country is normally something I'm not a huge fan of - basically I find that it gets so tourist-y and confusing, but I actually enjoyed reading about France from Anna's point of view.<br /><br />Another one of my pet peeves are YA romance novels that extend for a long period of time - an entire year, in this case. Although some stories may need more time to be told or a longer execution, I only experienced `Anna and the French Kiss' to be stretched out and repetitive, like it was really three novels in one. As I mentioned in the previous review, more than a couple of crying sessions is tiring.<br /><br />What I did like was the supporting characters (favorites were Josh and Rashimi, also Matt - of all people - struck a chord with me) and how stunningly the school was described as.<br /><br />What really made the book I must say was Anna's internal dialogue (funny, sarcastic, dramatic), her thoughts felt very real and true to the present time. She's an average girl, not hard to like.<br />As for &Eacute;tienne St. Clair, he seemed like a friendly character. Nice, but misleading and lost. Besides his attractive name and how mind-blowingly amazing his hair supposedly is, I wasn't that charmed.<br /><br />Bottom line, `Anna and the French Kiss' was a cute read. A bit overdone and, but still a cute read you ought to bring on the vacation.<br /><br />Loved it? No<br />Regret reading it? No<br />Will I read more from the author? Perhaps
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it, used ereader for more than 15 years, this is the best I've used and its free. I've made my own in the past and by far this exceeds my expectations.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a book that will keep you engrossed and very hard to put down.  Lots of excitement and \\"oh nos\\".  Keeps you on the edge of your seat to find out what happens next.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a perfect app for people who like to make lists.  I appreciate the option to color-code and password protect selected lists.  The calendar feature is a bit confusing and hard to access.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun game. some levels are harder than others. over all it is really fun. gumball misheen. fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
B0064BCNA4|4.0|Installed it mostly because my son is a musician. Sure enough he found the app while playing with my tablet. Needless to say he found it interesting, and I was delighted to hear him play. While he is a guitarist, he has had a year of piano lessons. #proudpapa
0525478817|5.0|John Greene did it again...wrote another excellent book. I don't want to spoil it for readers but, remember to pick up some Kleenex.<br />The characters are so well developed and the story sucks you in...read it one night.<br />Thanks again...for writing a beautiful book. This is a \\"keeper\\"
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Great game that is fun and challenging....wasn't satisfied with the free version so I bought the full version. my kids love it!!!
1594203334|5.0|I saw the author being interviewed.  She was wearing a black beret.  Every word that came out of her mouth made so much sense to me.  I am not disappointed with the book.  Only wish I had read it when I was raising my three!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have found in a long time. Lots of sounds to choose from and make unique combinations to listen to.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Very hard to argue with the song selection.  However, I believe one small change is in order.  \\"The Loner\\" instead of \\"Harvest Moon\\".  I love both songs but \\"The Loner\\" is more significant and would be a dynamite opener.  Also, I hate the see the 1st album left off of this nearly perfect collection.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Downloaded this app for android phone.  It is effective at keeping up with the phases of the moon. I would recommend this app for anyone who wants to keep up with the phases of the moon.
B004EPYZQ2|2.0|I was unable to fully enjoy this film due to the insanely loud sound fx mix and low dialogue mix. I had to ride the remote volume the whole time.
0894803123|5.0|We bought this along with an ice cream maker for our son's birthday.  He's been making one or two of the recipes from the book ever since he received it.  All but one of the recipes has been delicious so far.  He Loves the book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is an ok game app if you have time to kill because it has a varitey of games to play
B0035J6TAI|2.0|Unfortunately the album put me to sleep with the same formula (slow and melancholic)for each track resulting in a boring listening experience.<br />Nice try Pete - shame the new blood CD went down the same path.  I would strongly recommend anyone thinking of buying this (and new blood)to get a listen/sample first as the reviews are wide and varied and in my view, far too complimentary. Certainly NOT his best work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game, and so do my kids. The variety is awesome, some games can be a little hard but if you keep playing  eventually you'll win it!  The graphics are good and this game lasts and lasts you can play and play still have news things to do. It is definetly a game to pass time away. and the fact that its free, cant get much better. It does how ever have pop up ads to get you to buy more games but you can skip them just by pressing one button. Don't pass this game up! P.S.  haven't had one problem with the app since I downloaded it on my Kindle fire 2 months ago!
B004G6TD66|5.0|I'M A HUGE ELP FAN SINCE 1970 AND A KEITH EMERSON FANATIC SINCE THE NICE YEARS-1967/69.I HAVE MANY VERSIONS OF THIS CD AND THE WHOLE ELP CATALOGUE.I REALLY FEEL THE REMASTERING IS THE BEST ON THESE SONY CATALOGUE IMPORT RELEASES.THE PACKAGING AND BOOKLETS ARE ON THE MONEY!FOR ME,THESE ARE THE BEST AND COMPLEMENT THE ELP CATALOG TO A VERY HIGH DEGREE.I BOUGHT THE WHOLE CATALOGUE.BUT I LIKE TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS ELP CATALOGUE ON SONY.AND ALSO,RAZOR AND TIE RECORD LABEL HAVE SAID,THEY WILL RELEASE THE ELP CATALOGUE IN DELUXE EDITIONS.ALL COMMENTS WELCOMED.
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|I am and have been a big Bruce fan.  I don't think any of his recent work is a good as his older material, but  it's still a good listen.  But this album lyrics are very depressing.  In fact, I could not listen to the whole thing through at one sitting.  While sad story telling and protest songs have their place, I missed the optimism that is usually somewhere on a Springsteen album.  Reality can be depressing enough, I don't need music and Bruce to wollow in  it. It really is still OK to rock out once in a while, Bruce.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Not just a rehash - plenty of new challenges here.  It was well worth the buck I spent on it!  You'll like it too
1451683405|5.0|Excellent short examination of the topic of free will and how it is an illusion. If this is true as Harris argues then this will certainly give new meaning to what it means to be born lucky. Not only that, but it gives an interesting perspective of how we should view hideous crimes against us, which boils down to not hating them, but certainly prosecuting and incarcerating them since they should be removed from hurting anybody else. I suppose viewed in this light can probably bring quicker healing to those victimized families knowing that those who have hurt us or our families really had no free will on their own but we just born unlucky.<br /><br />The whole philosophy Sam is advocating can be boiled down to \\"You can do what you want, but you cannot choose what you want.\\" He also provides a rebuttal toward compatibilists like Daniel Dennett.<br /><br />Makes you look at things differently and gives you a new appreciation to life. At least this is how I came away from the book. I'll probably read this a few more times because I felt a few \\"aha\\" moments and also I felt inspired to be more moral.
B005FUTBV4|4.0|The person who told me to watch this said, \\"I won't tell you what it's about, who directed it,  or who's in it. Just watch it.\\" So I watched it. At first I wasn't sure if I were watching a teen slasher film, or a morality movie against hate crimes, or an action movie like SWAT. But it was more than enough to keep me interested. I liked Michael Parks' acting right from the start. Not his character, but his acting of it. By the time his sermon was over, I realized it didn't matter what kind of movie it was or who directed it, I wanted to see how it played out. There was a villain and sort of a hero, and, as for the outcome, there was way more lost than ever gained.<br /><br />Important issues were brought up in a horror film. Why not? Hate crime is horror. Murder is horror. Religious intolerance is horror. Domestic terrorism--by both sides of the law--is horror. Why have a slasher or a werewolf or a vampire when you have this preacher and the ATF?<br /><br />Once I remembered Kevin Smith directed, I thought, \\"Wow, I'm glad he did this. It's different for him, and it's something that will stay in your mind, for better or worse.\\"
B00536OCYG|5.0|Seeing as nobody has yet reviewed the 2012 vinyl edition, I thought I'd be the first. To start, it's a phenomenal reissue, despite the price tag (nearly $50). Anyway, the artwork is nearly identical to the original 1979 release, and the vinyl is 180 grams. It's a very good pressing, with no unwanted surface noise. Great dynamics too. Don't be fooled by the poorly pressed DSOTM release from a few months back; this is pretty much as good as vinyl reissues get. Also included is a new poster, which is probably around five by five feet. It contains all of the lyrics to the album printed over a brick overlay, much like the cover. It's a very nice touch. Anyway, don't let the hefty price tag deter you from purchasing this. It really is a quality product and the music is absolutely brilliant.
0439023521|5.0|First of all I have to say that I usually don't like dystopias or books for \\"older teenagers\\" or books about competitions to the death. This book has all three aspects but I couldn't stop reading. Katniss's first-person view really drew me in and I just had to find out how it all works out for her.<br />Very well written, great story, interesting underlying subject.
B003Y5H4YI|4.0|This was a very good and engaging movie, with the usual strong performance by Helen Mirren and a very good performance by Jessica Chastain, who I have now seen in 2 very different roles (The Help; The Debt).  She is certainly a versatile performer.  The movie as a whole was well worth the cost of the DVD.
B0059XTUO0|5.0|I didn't know much about the film going in, but it was more than I expected. I expected it to be an homage to silent film, when what I got was an actual silent film. It was charming and sweet and yearning. I didn't expect the dark themes, but that added to the weight of it, and the ending more than balanced it out. The unspoken dialogue happens in your mind, which is where a well-told story should take place.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|After reading all the positive reviews and enjoying Providence, I decided to check this book out. I really should've checked out the negative reviews first and saved myself time and money. The characters lacked any real depth and spines! I'm sorry to say, I don't find being a male slut sexy at all. Worse yet, after making sure \\"the girl\\" knows that you want her, have a small spat, then go out and bring two other girls to where you both live to f**k while \\"the girl\\" is home, listening from the other room. Who does that? And that is not something to get over easily, no matter how perfect you freaking are.<br /><br />It was often predictable and after that incident I found Travis unredeemable, so I stopped reading. After some skimming, I found I was right and the story ended as I thought it would. Disappointing.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Wow,it was like I hit the order button and the next day they both arrived flawless,only problem is I lent them both put to friends and they love it so much I can't can't them BOTH BACK ! Lol

0439023521|5.0|This book is the first book to an amazing trilogy that I fell in love with because of this book! This is a MUST READ!
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is not the typical movie about a man wrongly accused, but an excellent movie about how friendship can overcome any human condition. Perfect characters of Robbins and Freeman and the end is one of the most amazing in movie's history. Highly recommended for any kind of crowd.
B0071QIN00|5.0|this app is LEGEN... wait for it DARY!! amazing app really fun totally worth a buck ninety nine, controls are very simple
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is very addicting and challenging. The graphics are really cool and the goals make the game even more addicting. My best friend and I will play it for over an hour and still be entertained. I love it!!!
0761169253|3.0|This was a fun book with limited content. It may well contain new ideas for some readers. As someone familiar with postmodern concepts of pastiche and bricolage, these are a nice review.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|I usually read mystery/suspense type novels, but for some reason I decided to give this a shot. I actually really enjoyed this book. The fun, lighthearted nature of it left me feeling happy and optimistic. I was slightly frustrated at how careless Emma was at times in the book, but was also finding myself envying her for her simple, happy life. I will be incorporating more books like this into my collection.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|We all love the beloved angry birds characters but this app gets really old I mean really old, its fun the first couple of times but everyone has shirts of it youtube videos of it,I mean really this has a terrible lasting appeal
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|downloaded this huge app, played the first scene and liked it.  but then it stops and tries to tie you into the gs website.  after repeatedly saying I did not want to go to the gs site.  the game said, thank you, but if you want to continue playing this &quot;free &quot; app it will cost $4.99.  don't know about you but I call that a scam.  fun game if you can overlook the gs bs.
1612130283|5.0|Ok people, this isn't fine literature. But it sure is fun! It does contain explicit sexual content, not necessarily any more explicit than many so-called \\"romance\\" novels, but this content is of a particular sort: Bondage and Domination.<br />Anastasia Steele is an almost-college-graduate who is pressed into last minute service by her roommate, Kate, to interview Christian Grey, a young billionaire, for the college paper. When Anastasia meets Christian, they have an instant attraction and a romance of sorts ensues.<br />Unfortunately, Christian is damaged goods. He is only interested in a Dom-Sub relationship with Ana, and wants to control her in all ways within the confines of their contractual agreement (yes, he actually draws up a non-legally-binding contract to set out all of the limits and rules). Ana tries to create more of a relationship with him, and Christian comes to realize that while he is falling for her, she doesn't make a good Sub, except of course in the bedroom.<br />This book doesn't skirt around things or suggest as much as many books of this ilk do. Everything is plain and simple. And whoa, is it hot. The sex scenes (there are many, many of those) are well-explained, and the author refreshingly does not use many euphemisms for body parts (I am really tired of reading the word \\"core\\" for a woman's intimate anatomy).<br />I enjoyed the origins of the relationship between Ana and Christian, and they do seem to be very hot together.<br />I have a few issues here, however. One of my first thoughts about this book is how similar the characters are to Edward Cullen and Bella Swan from Twilight. Odd, I know, but there are plenty of parallells. Christian has \\"bronze\\" hair (whose hair is bronze??), he is extremely rich, tries to prevent Ana from being with him because he's \\"a bad guy\\", buys her many gifts, a car included, and is obscenely rich and young. Where Edward wanted to protect Bella's virtue is where Christian departs from the similarities. However, Ana is a virgin, like Bella, she has no idea that she's good looking, doesn't think Christian could like her because he's a \\"god\\" and she's just a plain girl, she doesn't like receiving gifts and gets mad when Christian buys her things. Also, Ana's mom is much like Bella's, on her 4th husband, and Ana went to live with her stepfather when her mom married \\"Husband #3\\" because they didn't get along. Ray, her stepfather, is quite similar to Charlie Swan, Bella's father. The list goes on. The stories themselves are not similar, but the characters are much alike in their demeanors and backgrounds.<br />All that being said, I did enjoy this book very much. I don't think it necessarily needs to be analyzed, as it is not intended as fine liturature, but it is extremely entertaining and very hot.<br />The bondage scenes are relatively mild, gaining intensity throughout the story, as Ana and Christian's relationship progresses, but they never get too out there or too odd for the average reader (at least in my opinion). Some may not agree, I suppose, so I would recommend this book, with caution for any that might possibly be offended by the content., Ana is a virgin, like Bella, she has no idea that she's good looking, doesn't think Christian could like her because he's a \\"god\\" and she's just a plain girl, she doesn't like receiving gifts and gets mad when Christian buys her things.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of really great games choices. hours of entertainment. Love the frog game. Games range from really easy, hard, to almost immpossible.
B0068RHSCW|1.0|Craig and company deliver great performances. The acting is top-notch. It starts off interestingly enough - and there are other reviews that'll give the reader more detail, and then it gets REALLY interesting, as the director proves that he bites off more than he can chew, and one has the feeling that somebody needed to up his meds, stop his meds, or in some fashion not panic as he did. It takes thoughtfulness to pull off a Mulholland Drive or Momento. What happens here is a sudden concoction is poured into the viewer's lap to pull all the pieces together that is so sophomoric and un-intelligent, un-creative and flat out-last-minute-i-dont-know-how-to-end-this' so I'll wrap it up this way' piece of mediocrity, that you feel cheated in the shell-game.<br />What is so shocking is that so many millions of dollars can be spent and still allow this mangled jumble to get out the door the way it is.
1423140591|5.0|I'm really loving this new series. I admit, The Lost Hero, was my favorite, but this was a close second. I feel that Rick Riordan is getting better and better with each new book to the Percy Jackson saga. If you're up for a fun adventure this series is really fantastic!

006097625X|5.0|If you have any kind of interest in the general topic of comics, or an interest in creating comics yourself or with a team, forget all but five books in the entire Amazon library and begin with this book right here.  It will teach you more about how to create comics without any 'how to' guides than every one of them combined.<br /><br />The other four are Making Comics (also by Scott McCloud), Comics and Sequential Art (Will Eisner,Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative (also by Will Eisner), and Drawing Words and Writing Pictures (Jessica Abel and Matt Madden). After them, every other book on the subject is either redundant, a terrible mish-mash of random bits of 'advice' or endless 'inspirational' quotes from big names in the field that actually teach you nothing.  If you are interested in one particular 'job' within comics, the DC line is fairly useful.  I own the ones on coloring and inking.<br /><br />But no house gets built well unless one understands foundations, and this book is about exactly that.  When it comes to foundations, comics is unlike any other form of art (cinematography comes closer than any one drawing style or art genre) and nobody lays it out better than McCloud and Eisner.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I truly enjoy using Evermore! I am a Radiography student and I use it every class. I also use it to study for my exams.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I think this is a really fine Springsteen album. Although I have been a fan for decades I don't think that every album is a classic, but I suspect that this may turn out to be one. The man certainly hasn't lost any of his ability to write a fine song, and there is a passion and often a rage running through Wrecking Ball which gives it real power. There is also a variety of material and styles here - country, gospel and even a little rap make an appearance - with some deeply introspective, almost Nebraska-style moments through to driving rockers like the title track, which I find makes the whole thing a riveting listen from beginning to end.<br /><br />It is the rage which strikes you most forcibly. Springsteen has always had a passionate love of his country and of its ordinary, decent people. He now also has a raw despair and fury at those who cheat those people and twist his country away from what he thinks it should and could be. This is thunderously and uncompromisingly overt in several songs - for example Jack Of All Trades (\\"If I had me a gun I'd find the bastards and shoot `em on sight\\") and Death To My Hometown:<br />\\"...Send the robber barons straight to hell -<br />Greedy thieves who came around<br />And ate the flesh of everything they found<br />Whose crimes have gone unpunished now<br />Who walk the streets as free men now<br />And brought death to my hometown.\\"<br /><br />Powerful stuff, and a great song which is sung with a fury and blame very different from the sad, fatalistic acceptance of economic hardship in songs like The River and My Hometown in the 80s. There is more on this album than just rage, though. Springsteen's strength as a songwriter has always been his ability to write a good, straightforward tune and to convey important human experiences and truths through singing about the small specifics of life, especially working life. He does a great job of that on this album and it is also good to see that he can still write a fine, direct love/lust song in You Got It.<br /><br />That great voice is still just as great, and the production is, as always, excellent. There is, of course, one giant absentee and I found the huge gap left by Clarence Clemons yawned at me on occasions, despite a fine brass section.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|This series is amazing.  I cannot speak highly enough about it.  Well written and enthralling.  Its formatted like interview with the vampire, and is as detailed as lord of the rings without the long, boring stretches
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I purchased this connector primarily as a way to watch on my TV, the collection of movies stored on my hard drive. The initial plan was to transfer the movies to my iPad or iPhone to view them on the TV screen. However, as a curiosity, I tried to watch them with AirVideo and it worked just fine. That way, the movies can be streamed directly from my computer to the TV through my iPhone or iPad. I have a iPhone 4 and and a first generation iPad. The Netflix and Video applications also work smoothly using this connector. It is true that the connection is fairly loose. This is the only flaw of this item but I don't see this as a big deal compared to the benefits.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is awesome! I accidently deleted it from my phone after they took it off the android market & finally found it at the Amazon app store. It works great on my htc evo & I've never had a problem downloading videos from youtube with it.

0525478817|5.0|I can't tell you how much I loved this book. My eyes are all red from crying, and I can't stop hugging my baby daughter. Green's writing is stellar, the characters feel real, and the questions brought up in the novel are thoughtful. This is the first time I've written a \\"review\\" for Amazon, and it's for good reason--this book will change your life. Get reading!

1451683405|5.0|While many philosophers (and people in general) dodge this \\"touchy subject,\\" Sam Harris tells it like it is.  And he does so in his signature style, plowing through the philosophical mumbo-jumbo in a direct, succinct manner.  It's easy for the layman to understand and can be read in an hour or two.<br /><br />This book will be a most refreshing read to those who are sick and tired of hearing the sayings \\"there's no excuse for your poor choices\\" or \\"you make your own luck\\" or \\"take some responsibility for your choices.\\"  While such sayings can be useful as motivational tools or helpful in causing one to change his behavior, ultimately we are never in a position to explain why such a change actually takes place (or fails to take place).  Harris describes why this is the case by showing how what seems like our ability to make \\"conscious choices\\" is actually just our awareness of choices that have been made unconsciously.  We experience an illusion of beeing the source of these choices but we never actually are that source.<br /><br />While some readers will initially (and mistakenly) interpret Harris' description as an endorsement of nihilism or fatalism, Harris takes a chapter to describe why deliberation, choices, intentions, hopes, fears, etc. are still as important as advocates of free will believe them to be.  Contrary to popular opinion, \\"no free will\\" need not lead to \\"meaninglessness\\" or \\"no morals.\\"  Harris writes how he believes that his acceptance of no free will has actually made him a better person, in that it's given him greater compassion for those who've been dealt a bad hand in life and humility in recognizing just how good a hand he's been dealt.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it so far great game. awesome for a free game. similiar to other building games... fun fun fun.! Definitely worth downloading

1451648537|5.0|I knew this is going to be a great book as I love the biography Walter Issacson wrote for Albert Einstain and Benjamin Franklin. I was not disappointed after reading through this book. A great biography makes you feel like to can set down with a historical figure and get to know them. This book does exactly that and brings to life Steve Jobs with all of his many contradictions.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|This watch is my first (and only) \\"Automatic\\" winding watch.  I've never been good at wearing watches.  What I mean is that I usually end up cracking the lenses, breaking the bands, or simply losing them.  And, the only reason I bought this watch is because it was a requirement for EMT school.  (The teacher insisted that we have a watch that clearly showed the seconds, which supposedly would make taking pulse rates easier.  Go figure.)  So, after searching Amazon and reading reviews, I decided to buy this one.  It seemed to be the light-weight, low-profile, relatively inexpensive watch that I was looking for.  For the purposes I've listed, I'd recommend this watch, but that recommedation would not be without some qualifiers.  To make things simple, I'll list the good and the bad:<br /><br />The Good:<br />-Narrow band and small watch face makes for more comfortable wearing.  (Easier to bend wrist while wearing it. Easy to position higher or lower on wrist.)<br />-Unlike metal bands, this one doesn't pinch or pull hairs.<br />-Unlike rubber bands, this one doesn't cause sweating.<br />-Lens has been remarkably wear resistant.  (As a firefighter/EMT, I've banged this watch against hard/sharp objects hundreds of times now, thinking for certain that I would have scratched or cracked it.  So far, there's not a single scratch!)<br />-Band snaps free of watch when caught on an object. (I've snagged the watch several times now on different objects during work which resulted the band snapping loose from the watch body.  The reason I've listed this as \\"Good\\" is because each time it has been very easy to simply pop the band's retaining, spring-rods (don't know the technical term) back into the watch.  So, its good that the watch will separate/snap free when snagged without causing any permanent damage the band retainers!)<br />-If worn consistently (every day for a several hours each day), the watch doesn't require manual winding.<br />-Shows the seconds as the largest numbers, making it very easy to count off seconds.<br />-Water resistance seems to be well designed.  (Its been sprayed with pressurized water and submerged and so far shows no signs of leaks.)<br />-Back of watch is transparent, allowing one to see the inner workings.  Very cool!<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />-Does not stay wound very long if not worn constantly.  If you skip a day wearing this watch (or if you wear it but don't move around a lot, it will wind down over night and necessitate resetting it.<br />-Tricky to get it to keep time accurately.  At first, I decided to do the manual winding method (shake it from side to side) every morning on each day I would wear it, but that resulted in it being over-wound.  So, it would keep time too fast or gain time (approx. 10 mins within a couple days).  Then, I decided to not do any manual winding, but quickly discovered that it would keep time too slowly or loose time (approx. 10 mins per 2 days).  Ultimately, there's a sweet spot where one learns just the right ratio of manual winding to \\"automatic\\" winding.  At this point in ownership, I've managed to establish a manual/automatic winding routine where at most I'll gain or lose only about 2 to 3 minutes from actual time over the course of a week.  And, according to what I've read, a 2 to 3 minute variance in 7 days is very good accuracy for a mechanical watch in this price range.<br />-Can be annoying to set the day of the week and calendar day.  (There's a specific time window each day that you can directly set these.  It has to do with the A.M. and P.M. positioning.  Since there's no visual indicator of whether the watch is on the rise or fall of the 12/24 hour clock cycle, you can't necessarily simply change the day of the week and calendar day to what it's supposed to be and expect it to change correctly on the next day.  You may have to also change the time, cycling through an entire 12 hour interval, to make sure that the date will change at midnight instead of noon.  I hope that makes sense...)<br />-Glow-in-the-dark watch hands are not very bright or of long duration.  (If they're exposed to a bright light (sunlight or intense, up close lamp light), the hands glow brightly in the dark, but only for a few minutes.  I know that all such phosphorescent-based photoluminescent materials are subject to gradual fading, but the hands on this watch seem to be the fastest-fading, dimmest of any watch I've ever owned. This is very problematic if you need to check the time or count seconds when its dark.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Despite the problems listed above, I'm mostly satified so far with the performance of this watch.  Once I worked out/adapted to its quirks, it serves me well.  I'm especially impressed with its durability.  I've put this watch through some heavy abuse, but it has remained scratch and defect free!  As someone who has always hated wearing watches, I've grown to like wearing this one so much that I'm thinking of buying another with a brown band to wear to church and such, since my current black band clashes with most of my dress clothes/shoes/coats.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great and fun game to waste time. My kids love it as well. I would recommend this came to ANYONE!!!
B004G6009K|5.0|I was really surprised by this film. I brushed it off as another CGI kids flick that I wasn't interested in. My girlfriend wanted to watch it, and I was willing to \\"put up with it\\". We were both very impressed with the film and it has become one of our favorites. When I got a 3D HDTV, this was one of the first movies I picked up and always the first that goes in the blu-ray player when I want to show off the 3D to guests. Great film that looks great in 3D!
1587613379|4.0|This book was amazing. I checked it out from a University Campus Women's Center Library and loved it so much I had to buy it. Even if you aren't interested in being in an open relationship this is a great book to expand your thinking on love and relationship. Also a wonderful resource for people who are struggling with jealousy issues.
B0052U59F4|4.0|As my title says, this book is totally Twilight meets Pretty Woman.  I enjoy them both, but the book seems kind of unoriginal in that respect.  The writing is not very good.  Especially in the first book.  I like the characters and they are what got me addicted and sucked into reading all three books in four days.  I will say though, that some of the stuff was way too repetitive.  Constantly hearing about her inner goddess and her subconscious was stupid and annoying!  Towards the end I skipped to the next paragraph when I saw either of them mentioned.  The sex scenes were lame and slightly unrealistic (in the frequency sense).  Honestly, I read this because I heard the books were \\"hot\\". In that area they were disappointing. I did like the characters, though, so that made up for it.
1250004217|5.0|A fabulous read, couldn't put it down!  Gorgeous hard cover edition, too!  The author did a great job of pulling the reader into the story to read until finished!

193413712X|5.0|I stumbled upon this book recently and If I weren't a card carrying buddhist/atheist (still waiting for the toaster oven promised when I joined) I would have fallen to my knees in thankfulness.  I have been reading for 58 years and thought that I was exhibiting symptoms of alzheimer's because it seems I have been reading the same books over and over for the past few years.  I decided that there were only so many great literary themes and they had all been done to death.  However, Mr. Harding renewed my faith in literature.  This book is a lyrical thing of beauty.  Thank you, sir.

014312093X|1.0|I have not a clue as to what this book is about. I have reread the first 70 pages several times thinking I missed something.  I like books that challenge me, but this is rediculous. Was there a prequel to this book that I should have read?
B00280LYIC|4.0|If you or your kids enjoyed the Harry Potter books, chances are you'll enjoy this series as well. A boy who never felt like he fit in anywhere finds out he comes from a fantastical world normal humans are unaware of. Coming into this world he finds out that, even here, he is special and immediately famous because of the part of his family he never knew, despite some bumps he is able to form bonds of friendship with a couple of other kids that will be his constant companions through this and later adventures... sound familiar? Sure. But that doesn't mean it's an HP rip-off like some people have called it. It simply shares the same themes because it's directed at the same audience.  After you get past this similarity you see that the book is a good story, full of fun moments and even though its set against this fantastical world full of elements of Greek mythology, it is told from Percy's point of view which makes the narrative very simple, human and funny. I'm now halfway through book 3 and I've enjoyed the stories so far and seeing the author's interpretation of the mythological characters living in modern times as he keeps introducing them into the story.<br />Do I like it better than Harry Potter? So far, no. But it's still a good story worth reading and well worth the price for the kindle versions.
B004QX07G4|1.0|This book is a waste of your time and money.  There is no story to it, nothing makes sense.  It is a conglomeration of useless thoughts that don't form any complete thoughts.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I have had this game for about a month now. You can bowl straight or put spin on the ball. I have probably bowled about 50 games on it. It has never froze up. There is one major flaw in it, if you bowl a gutter ball on your first throw you still get a strike if you knock all the pins down with your second ball , this I consider to be fairly major, other than that its pretty decent
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather collection arrived in good condition and I appreciate the overall condition. The trilogy is a favorite of mine and I am quite pleased with how this item fit the definition given on Amazon.
B0071PS7AC|2.0|This Game has no instructions so you basicly go in not knowing what to do. And you don't know when the ball will curve and your opponent always wins. Good free app but not worth its full price.

B007E6YYLO|5.0|I love this show...  If it only could come on more than once a week for 9 weeks I might be a more happy person!
B0071PS7AC|5.0|I just played my first game and loved it!  I was terrible, but as a bowler who throws a curve ball, it's fun figuring out the &quot;physics&quot; of the game. I think some are too lazy to do that and therefore don't like it. What would be great for this game would be a &quot;pass and play&quot; feature so you could challenge a friend. Great graphics and sound!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is so much fun. I always find myself playing. if you want a good app get this one =)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is nothing comparable to the twilight series. the only thing they have in common is that once you started it you couldn't stop. The love, loyalty and the fighting was all portrayed in the best way and it wasn't just about one aspect. The true ups and downs of peoples lives and what people will do to survive and save the ones they love. Very well written and an amazing story overall!
B0071MV540|5.0|This movie is very exciting.  I have already watched it 2 times.  Its a real feel good movie.  Much recommended.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|Not sure what some are saying about the controls they work fine. Rolled strike after strike way to easy.<br />Good game for kids since its easy. i won't keep it.
1401307450|3.0|I'm astonished at how Kiedis was able to survive and find such success with his type of destructive, narcissistic lifestyle.<br />  As a musician myself, I find that things only progress or get done when I apply hard work and discipline, and that the progress will often stagnant if these things are not applied. If you try to balance hard drugs with a career the drugs will eventually dominate and consume you. But yet the Red Hot Chili Peppers somehow survived, despite numerous drug problems, personnel changes and an overdose death (Kiedis did not even bother to attend guitartist's Hillel Slovak's funeral and continued abusing drugs after). Bands have broken up for alot less.<br />  Also, Kiedis speaks of living like a skeletal junkie, but yet looks healthy and ripped in appearance. To get such a muscular build takes hard work in exercise. The effect of drugs will definitely take a toll on your appearance, as it did with Frusciante. But somehow Kiedis managed to avoid this as well.<br />  People who live like Kiedis usually end up either dead or in prison. He is a very fortunate person who somehow managed to avoid these pitfalls and find great success, as he did not seem to learn from mistakes or have much structure in his life.<br />  Hollywood is a vain and selfish town, with very little moral fiber, and Kiedis is a pure product of it due to his wild upbringing.<br />  He was lucky to survive it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The PS3 Dualshock 3 is, in my opinion, the best game controller ever made for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1.  Stylish, comfortable feel.  It fits in the palms of your hands like no other.  Perfectly ergonomic and looks awesome at the same time.  Long gone are the days of the old \\"Nintendo thumb\\" and other such maladies from extended gameplay.  I'm mentally fatigued long before my hands are and that should be the ultimate goal.<br /><br />2.  Wireless connectivity is flawless.  I can easily reach 15 feet across my room without a single bit of dropout or lag.  The battery life is also tremendous.  Can easily last 8-10 hours on a single charge which, to me, means that I only need to charge it once every two weeks or so for an hour, if that.<br /><br />3.  The \\"Dualshock\\" feature really gets you into the action like no other, but remains smooth and comfortable throughout.  It adds for a much more engaging playing experience without being distracting in any way, shape, or form.<br /><br />What else can one say?  This is a controller for the ages and the only thing that Sony would need to do for future releases is simply work on extending the battery life as the technology continues to improve.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|The movie was kind of slow for me.  An interesting concept kind of strong out over too long of a period.  Its not even really about baseball.
0802473156|5.0|This book is well written, and easy to read. Very informative and touches on unique issues which often go undisclosed by other authors/psychologists.

0307956350|5.0|Washington, D.C. based financial systems security expert Dexter Moore accepts a terrific job in Luxembourg.  As he, his wife Kate and their kids prepare to cross the Atlantic, Dexter is unaware that his spouse was a CIA operative for fifteen years, who resigned to accompany her husband and their two children to Europe.  Her plan is to be a caring wife and nurturing mother.<br /><br />In Luxembourg, Kate struggles to adjust to a passive lifestyle.  However she awakens from the housewife blues when a stunned Kate learns the FBI and Interpol investigate her nerdy husband for allegedly stealing fifty-million euros in an illegal online banking deal.  Needing to know the truth about her spouse, while wondering whether she erred in giving up her espionage career to be a housewife, Kate investigates Dexter's allegedly felonious activities.<br /><br />This is a great espionage investigative thriller filled with red herrings, and super twists that keep the audience wondering what next.  Fast-paced, fans will appreciate Kate's inquiry with fervor as she ponders the ennui and lack of satisfaction in being a housewife.  Although the relationship between Kate and Dexter never quite gels, The Expats is a terrific thriller.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B005XQ973M|4.0|This book deals with a shocking event in history. I am a person who is greatly read in books of all phases of History. At age 69,I just read this Kindle book which I purchased,on line,at Amazon.com. In it, I learned of an event that far over shadows the enormity of Hitler's anillation of Europe's Jews. It's a must read for ALL.
1932100660|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a physician. Bough it and read it within two days and was very glad I did. This book is quite well written, very informative and current. The research in the book is presented in an easy to understand way and is helpful to most anyone. The best part of the book is that it informs about many unique issues that other nutrition books, of which I have read many, either don't touch on or totally oppose. It's refreshing to be informed about these current, relevant ideas. Those with no particular interest in nutrition and who are looking for a good read or self improvement would also enjoy this book. I highly recommend it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I'm just happy that they finally got all three of these apps.....I been looking for them on my kindle and here they are....I absolutely love these games, there fun, time consuming and easy to manage...only if we didn't need the Internet to get on it.....
B00318COS4|5.0|I am in my 20s and absolutely loved this game. I have played nearly every game there is for PC, Xbox, PS3, etc. (from first person shooters to real time strategy to puzzle games, you name it, I really have played it all) and still think about this game months after having finished it. The art and design of this game is whimsical, addictive and absolutely stunningly gorgeous and the gameplay is simple to understand but very challenging to even the brightest minds. I bough the game for my younger brother (10) and he enjoyed it as much as I did. There's no gore, no violence, it teaches peace, friendship and to do good by correcting the \\"bad guy's\\" wrong-doings with help from a friend, so this is absolutely appropriate for younger kids.<br /><br />One of my favorite games of all time. Definitely get this game!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|No crashes, decent graphics and small footprint (RAM) for those with older cells and tablets. Gameplay is simple including controls, I have seen better controls to give more realistic gameplay but a good overall effort. I can say I wouldn't pay anything for this as it is.
1451683405|5.0|I don't read many books, but  I gave up TV for Lent, so I downloaded this for some lunchtime entertainment.  I ended up reading it almost like I would an academic article, taking notes in the margin every time I took issue with one of the arguments.  Surprisingly, the author addressed nearly all of my \\"issues.\\".<br /><br />This book probably was not the best choice for lunchtime entertainment, but it did give me something to ponder this afternoon.  I'm actually afraid the book might stick with me and keep me from getting anything done at work.<br /><br />I will be suggesting this book to quite a few friends.

B005DMNS4A|5.0|This is, in my opinion,is The Who's finest work!<br />The music is a rock n' roll symphony and the words are modern poetry in motion.<br />My hats off to Peter Townsend!<br />The performances by Roger,Keith,John and Peter are astounding.<br />Long live Rock n'Roll!<br />This body of work is to be listened to from beginning to end.<br />It truely is an amazing journey!
B006GH6IWU|5.0|Quiet an extraordinary form to pay tribute to one of the greatest Rock vocalist of all ages. Is really an exclusive experience to really get to know more about the Queen band; because, if you remember, there were always an incredible silence and hermetism with a lot of things and circumstances concerning within the band. Not only about Freddie Mercury!!!... My experience with this video buster (for real Queen fans) was the experimentation of very intense feelings, it's really and emotive film that shows the human side of four big musicians; from the situation of Brian with his father about being a musician (\\"Thank you Madison Square Garden...\\"), to the Freddie's goodbye with the video filmation of the track \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\" and his final passing away (I was really crying with all that situations, like if all the situations just had happened!)... Since my very young years I have been a real Queen Fan that love almost all the Queen Music... It's a very introspective video with a lot of friends and media broadcast people that coments about the band's career, songs, and every aspect of the fab four monarchy. Plus several amazing new footage clips of classic songs like \\"Somebody to Love\\" or \\"We Are The Champions\\" just to name two videos that I really enjoy again like it was yesterday... Very recomended!<br /><br />And there is another part of the band's story, a thing that was not revealed before, and it's about the unrespectfull relatioship between the English press and Queen... As I can tell, through my real experience with the media: the truth is that behind all that image of fashion in some of the mediums (in this case the english Press), there are a lot of selfish interests of the editors, writers, managers, etc. prove to all of this, is the Brian May's video comment: \\" Maybe if you got too succesful too quick, as they thought, there was a resentment there that they hadn't made you, therefore they wanted to break you\\"... Nowadays the thing is that there is no more good Rock music, no more good Rock bands at all in this planet. because all that have airplay by radio or T.V. are created by people that really don't mind the Rock music but just the plastic and their money interests. and It's really a shame!. I really miss all that classic bands, I miss Freddie Mercury and I miss Queen (A good complement for this DVD film is \\"The Making of A Night At The Opera\\" (from Classic Albums label) that was release a few years ago)...

B004SIP71M|3.0|The performances were great but the pacing was a bit slow. People say it's thought provoking but I didn't feel that I learned anything new. The movie was ok. If you've read other reviews then you already know what this movie is all about: Basically, Philip Seymour Hoffman's character of sexual misconduct with at least one of his students. The \\"evidence \\" is flimsy at best but still Meryl Steep's character feels that she is correct in going after him. Philip Seymour Hoffman's says in the movie something to the effect of \\"A feeling of certainty is not the same thing as fact.\\" Really? I could say the same thing to religious people...but I'm not going there. As I stated the performances were great and you feel for the characters but the title of the movie sort of lets you know how the movie ends: After all of Meryl Streep's claims of being certian and righteous in her actions it turns out that she has...that's right: \\"Doubt\\"s.
B004LWZW4M|3.0|This movie was actually better than I was anticipating; I had heard a lot of negatives, and wasn't expecting much.<br /><br />It was a pretty predictable story, but enjoyable nonetheless.  I also thought it was good to see some focus on not only the research lab environment for the chimps but also the environment and the abuse they suffered at the private chimp \\"sanctuary\\"; it certainly tore at my heart strings, although animal abuse is admittedly a pet interest of mine and I am probably biased.  Unfortunately media and movies etc are where most people get their information these days, and it can therefore have an impact on how people view issues and I thought this movie did a good job of bringing some of those issues to the viewer's attention.  They also did a good job of showing why we should be worried about research that isn't properly screened or thought through.<br /><br />On the other hand, some of the acting was a bit over the top at times, and as I said before the story was pretty predictable.  I also felt that the side plot with the researcher who gets sick was a bit pointless; it was so sidelined that it seemed silly to have included it since it was never really followed up on - unless they were setting it up for a follow up movie (I sincerely hope not - this movie was not strong enough to support a sequel, in my opinion.<br /><br />Decent watch, but nothing special!  I don't know that I will watch it again, but I didn't feel that I wasted my time watching it the first time.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie, I believe was made for TV. It is a very good movie. Course Peck is most of the time, excellant in what he does. World War 2 movies are usually about the Nazis. It was a bad time for people. The movie is well done and keeps you in suspence. If you like war or war related movies you'll like this one.

B006ZCWTV0|4.0|Wrecking Ball is an angry album dealing with hard and desperate times: unemployment, economic discrepancies, and personal displacement are just a few of the underlying themes addressed.  It is also an album where many of the musical styles Bruce Springsteen has engaged in come together, along with new elements such as loops and a more pronounced use of female singers.<br /><br />It opens with We Take Care of Our Own, a song that musically sounds like vintage E Street Band; it is, in its own way, as powerful an opening track as Badlands or Born in the U.S.A.  Like that latter song, it could receive a mistaken interpretation by the casual listener drawn in to the catchy chorus.  But, where the chorus declares \\"We take care of our own,\\" the lyrics examine an America where needed help never appears.<br /><br />Shackled and Drawn and Death to My Hometown both bear strong resemblances to the tracks Springsteen performed during his Seeger Sessions time.  With their Irish feel, they sound like songs that Shane MacGowan could sink his crooked teeth into with joy.  Easy Money, a song about a man going out with his lover to commit crimes to make some cash, has a ramshackle, country feel that perfectly matches Springsteen's grizzled snarl.<br /><br />The title track presents Springsteen reminiscing about coming up in the \\"swamps of Jersey,\\" referencing his classic track Rosalita.  It is a defiant song in which Bruce dares all comers to \\"take your best shot/let me see what you got.\\"  It is an exhilarating song; at 62, The Boss is still willing to throw down the gauntlet.<br /><br />Wrecking Ball, for all its anger, ends on a hopeful note.  Land of Hope and Dreams, a song that debuted during the 1999-2000 E Street reunion tour, uses the imagery of the freedom train carrying passengers to a better destination.  The final track (on the regular edition release), We Are Alive, with sweeping, loping music that could fit in a 60s western, tells of departed souls rising up in solidarityand strength.  One final note: midway through Land of Hope and Dreams, we hear a saxophone solo by the late Clarence Clemons.  It's like receiving a call from a long lost friend.  For a few moments, it seems as if the Big Man is truly as immortal as implied by Springsteen in his moving eulogy.  It is a transcendent moment, one of the high points of a truly fine addition to the Springsteen canon.  Recommended listening.

B006G2NVCA|5.0|Obviously I saw the film in theaters before asking for this for my birthday. After receiving it I'm extremely happy I did! As most probably know Trent Reznor is the lead singer/composer for the band Nine Inch Nails which is where I and most people know him from. His collaboration with Atticus Ross in this soundtrack is probably, to me at least, his best work since possibly 'The Fragile' it reminded me of it but it's so much better I almost want to compare it to 'The Downward Spiral' which is my favorite Nine Inch Nails album and one of my favorite all time albums I have ever listened to.<br /><br />'Immigrant Song' is one of the best covers I've heard in quite a long time. I still remember the feeling I had while watching the film that the soundtrack alone was worth seeing it for and I still stand by that after listening to the soundtrack CD a few times. I love soundtracks as background music for doing stuff around the house and you just want something playing that doesn't have a lot or any singing/lyrics since I find that distracting when I'm occupied with a task. This soundtrack not only fits the film perfectly it's versatile for at home use too. Plus it's so different compared to normal score soundtracks like 'Lord of the Rings' or anything by John Williams and I love that about it. I think Trent Reznor found a new niche that compliments his talent as an artist.<br /><br />I will admit it is not for everyone and I'm sure many will probably think I'm nuts for comparing it to 'The Downward Spiral' or 'The Fragile' but it gave the same feeling to me. Some of the tracks tend to sound repetitive at times but then it is a soundtrack CD and even orchestral soundtracks can sound repetitive too. I think it's worth a listen even if you haven't seen the film and even more so if you have.

B000WQBO8O|5.0|Review of the 12\\" vinyl original of Santana's 1972 album 'Caravanserai'<br /><br />Released in October 1972, `Caravanserai' marks one of Santana's highest and most sublime creative moments and has often been described as \\"music for musicians\\". It's the last of Santana's studio recordings to feature founder-member Gregg Rolie on keyboards and second-guitarist (the very young but virtuoso) Neal Schon, both of whom were shortly to depart to form `Journey.' Rolie features on some tracks and new keyboard player Tom Coster appears on others, the start of a decades-long and highly productive association between Coster and Santana.<br /><br />Founder-member David Brown is replaced on bass by Doug Rauch (on some of the numbers) and Tom Rutley (on others) and the departure of Mike Carabello as conga-percussionist heralded the entry of veteran Armando Peraza - who, I can tell you from seeing this band live in 1973, had one heck of an onstage presence and added a lot to the sound. Drummer Mike Shrieve and percussionist `Chepito' are still there, both evident in the music. Altogether `Caravanserai' showcases contributions by some 16 different musicians and is a masterpiece of arrangement and production; it marks the beginning of a rich and productive journey into deeper, more complex jazz-fusion territory which continued with `Welcome' and - especially - `Borboletta.'<br /><br />The trademark rock-salsa fusion sound which made Santana's first three studio albums a global commercial success gives way here to more thoughtful, jazz-like compositions, though you can hear the genealogy of the Woodstock-era band still there underneath. Of the 10 numbers on the album, only three have any vocal content and the first six pieces (i.e. the first `side' of the original vinyl LP) flow together as one, with no real breaks. `Caravanserai' though impressive on first listening, is not such an instantly-accessible musical listening experience as the first three albums. The band experiments with different time-signatures and instrumentation in complex compositions to weave an engrossing musical tapestry which wins over the head, the heart and the soul where repeat-listening reveals ever more depth and subtlety.<br /><br />If you like to seek out great music of any era and especially if you have a penchant for jazz-rock fusion and you've never heard `Caravanserai', then you're in for a rare treat. This mid-1970s period was the high-point of Carlos Santana's long creative career: here he is in his prime, a master of his craft with experience and global success behind him, but wanting to explore music a bit deeper, maybe with less popular appeal but ultimately more personally satisfying, more valuable and enduring. Put on the headphones, lie back, crank up the volume and be transported to a land rich, beautiful and sublime.<br /><br />I am BTW writing this in Hatta, close to the UAE/Oman border. As the Sun rises, a herd of wild camels is visible on a distant hill to the South: a real-life spectacle almost identical to the original cover-art of this: Santana's great, timeless fourth album.ifferent time-signatures and instrumentation in complex compositions to weave an engrossing musical tapestry which wins over the head, the heart and the soul where repeat-listening reveals ever more depth and subtlety.<br /><br />If you like to seek out great music of any era and especially if you have a penchant for jazz-rock fusion and you've never heard `Caravanserai', then you're in for a rare treat.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|My husband started watching sons and kept telling me to watch with him. After a few days of nagging I was \\"ok\\"! This show is amazing. The acting and drama between each character is so genuine. I love the cameos of actors that come in as random characters. I thought it was going to be raunchy and lame. It was crazy action packed. Each character is so well acted they don't do things out of character just to complete a story line. At the end of the episode it all makes sense. There is plenty of drama for me and plenty of action and motorcycles for my husband. We actually talk about it when the shows not on because we are so connected to the characters. Just watch and you will see you will be hooked you won't be able to help yourself. You will end up like me searching the internet for season 5....I tell you its KILLING me.
0439023513|4.0|I did not know about this series until the movie was advertised, so I purchased the first book, and ran out the next day and bought the other two.  I was completely absorbed in the story, thought it well written and imaginative.  This was the most disappointing of the three, but still a good read.  I thought that Kat's response to all of the death, destruction and trauma was what it should be; painful, emotionally damaging and life changing.  It's difficult when you see characters die that have become familiar, but it seemed as though the sacrifice belonged in this story.

I'm not going to go through the summary like everyone else, (you can read that on the back cover). I am simply overwhelmed by its beauty.

1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is a must read for those who want to get insight into a man who has transformed the world.  Jobs influence has changed the computing, music, and movie industry.  Isaacson's past works on center on individuals who merge creativity and science.<br />This book received Jobs blessings and also is a candid assessment of his short life.  Isaacson traces Jobs from his biological parents and growing up in the loving home of his adopted ones.<br />Jobs comes away as much more complex character than his turtle neck public persona.  Here was an individual who lived as an Zen Buddhist way to be detached from material things, but create products that individuals coveted as an extension of themselves.<br />Jobs was relentless to push the envelope and force the world to view itself through a different lens.<br />This book is also revealing in his personal relationships and the pain and joy he experienced from them.<br />Even though the book is a bit over 600 pages, you glide over the material and are left with a better appreciation form

B00005N5S5|5.0|A wonderful modern version of the oldest of all tales...<br />TERMINATOR is a movie purely incredible in many ways, but the two best things in it are first the successful modern retelling of THE tale mentioned in the title, (a tale which appears at least once in all human cultures since the dawn of time) and then the unique and powerful love story. There are also many other treasures in this film (see below, at the end of the review).<br /><br />But first, the tale. From distant and terrible future comes to present day the Dragon (or if you prefer you can call it the Beast, the Monster, the Destroyer, or any other similar name). This Dragon is a powerful and cunning monster - it hides its real form (and it can even disguise its real voice), it doesn't feel pain, it never sleeps, it doesn't need to eat, drink or even rest, it knows no mercy, no fear, no doubt - and as if it was not enough, all its vital organs are covered with nearly indestructible armor... Few of those who will cross his path will live to tell the tale - and even those lucky few will be marked by its passage for ever, in their chair and in their mind. Oh, by the way, the Dragon looks very much like Arnold Schwarzenegger...<br /><br />The Dragon came for one and only one reason - it must find and slay the Princess (in some versions of this story also called the Maiden, although in this particular case she is probably no more qualified...). The Princess name is Sarah Connor and she bears a strong resemblance to young Linda Hamilton. She is absolutely not aware of her importance and being born in a very average family, she lives a rather banal life of hard labor and simple pleasures. On the surface she is a very average young girl, barely out of her teens, not very bright, not very ambitious, not very courageous (at least in the beginning in the movie), cute but not really a stunning beauty - but in fact she is the most important woman in human history since Virgin Mary! And if the Dragon finds her and kills her, all humanity will perish with her!<br /><br />Lucky for her and the whole humanity, the Dragon has been tracked and followed by the Knight (the Prince, the Paladin, the Hero, the Warrior, the Monster-Slayer, the Great Hunter, etc.) who swore to save the Princess (and therefore the whole humankind) no matter what the price, without any regard for his own safety. This Knight, who looks like Michael Biehn, is still young, but in the same time he is already a precociously aged battle scarred veteran, who slayed many a lesser dragon before, but who never yet faced such a formidable foe as this particular Beast. Even worse, he had to leave his magic sword (here called plasma rifle) behind, in his own times... For that reason the Knight can not just face the beast and slay it - he must first find the Princess and place her in a safe place and only then find a way to outsmart the Dragon, to have at least a chance in the unavoidable confrontation. And that will really, really NOT be an easy quest!<br /><br />The TALE would not be complete however if love did not intervene. And surprisingly TERMINATOR, when one looks carefully, is in fact a story about an incredible love. A love completely mad, passionate, burning, tragic, condemned from the beginning, without any hope to be fulfilled but which will ultimately defy the time, the destiny and even the death itself - and triumph! And it may well be, that by this love the whole humanity will be saved - or at the very least get a fragile second chance...<br /><br />As promised, here are some other treasures you can find in this movie. There is the excellent camera work, great music and an incredible atmosphere of a great city (Los Angeles) at night with its game of lights and shadows - all of which is the trade mark of great James Cameron, who signed here his first masterpiece. There are excellent second roles of Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen and Earl Boen. There are action scenes which still are impressive 28 years later and which did not age at all. There is the archi-famous Schwarzenegger's line &#34;I will be back&#34;, which contains so much menace in it that I still shiver when hearing it even if I watched this movie like 20 times already. And finally, there is the water and fire proof perfection of scenario which appears in its full glory in the last two minutes of the movie...<br /><br />I can not find any more words which could praise this movie enough, so I will stop here, inviting you with all my heart to discover this immortal tale, in which the Dragon, the Princess and the Knight will meet their respective fates... and in which they will all lose... but in the same time they will also all win (as it is explained with more detail in the less magnificent, but still very honest sequel).ater and which did not age at all.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|\\"Wrecking Ball\\" is Bruce Springsteen's finest album in a long time.  Each track moves me in a different way. The late great Clarence Clemons plays the saxophone on the track \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\". This song is a reminder that all people are united together in the spirit of friendship and brotherhood. Clarence plays the sax for only about one minute, but his sound is so distinctive.  He makes this song special. The first single off this album is  \\"We Take Care Of Our Own\\". This is a song that makes me proud to live in the United States.  These two songs have the same inspirational tone. \\"Jack of All Trades\\" is another song I like.  This song is about having a humble and grateful attitude to work.  This is a song about trying to survive.  The piano playing and horns are beautifully arranged on this track.  \\"Shackled And Drawn\\" does not convey optimism with the title, but the arrangement is so uplifting to listen to.  This is the kind of song I will listen to pick me up.  \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is a song about the pride that Bruce has for his home state of New Jersey.  I love the sentiment of this track. \\"American Land\\" is about the drive of millions of immigrants to survive and succeed in America.  This song is really fun to listen to. \\"You've Got It\\" is a song about the inner strength that each person has inside of them. This song makes me feel empowered.  \\"This Depression\\" is a socially conscious song about the state of the American economy.  Bruce sings about the frustration that many people feel about being out of work.  Tom Morello plays the electric guitar beautifully on this track.  This song is very moving. \\"We Are Alive\\" is musically arranged so well.  Every instrument brings something special to this song.  This song features horns, banjo and the violin.  This song puts me in the mood to take a trip on the open road.  \\"Swallowed Up By The Belly Of The Whale\\" reminds me how short life really is.  The violin brings a tear to my eye at the end.  This is a very sad but lovely song.  \\"Easy Money\\" is such a happy song.  It took me a while to realize that this song is  about a criminal's attitude toward earning money.  \\"Rocky Ground\\" is a song about yearning for serenity and guidance in life.  This song has a spiritual tone.  The horns playing on this song create a reflective tone on this track.  I love every song on this new album.but lovely song.  \\"Easy Money\\" is such a happy song.

B005HV6Y5W|2.0|While the artistic merits of this film can't be ignored or denied, the rest of it is truly a waste. I wanted to shut it off after about 20 minutes, and I have a very high annoyance tolerance for films. Visually, it is stunning but combined with a non-linear story-line, an odd plot and wasted acting, The Tree of Life is simply a bore. You can't even really summarize this film properly. During the 50's three sons are seen growing up in a typical home with a somewhat strict (but not bad) father and now, in present day, the eldest reflects on his sad past. Why is he so angry and resentful? Who knows, because the mere glimpses we get are not nearly enough to establish anything. Sean Penn plays the modern day son and I'm pretty sure he doesn't utter a single word in the entire movie except a random whisper to the viewers. In fact, I read recently that while he was on set, he had no idea what he was even doing there because he apparently didn't know what the point of his role was... Brad Pitt plays the 'stern' father back in the past (and does a marvelous job actually) but again, his character is never fully fleshed out so we only get a surface picture of him. Jessica Chastain is the mother, who wanders the film aimlessly, loving her boys and husband, but never speaking a word of importance. She does love washing her feet alot though...... There's also alot of whispering in the movie.<br /><br />The one redeaming factor is the beautifully haunting score. I didn't realize until the credits that Alexandre Desplat conducted this. He is my new favorite composer after hearing his work in other recent films. It really is a glorious and noticable score and I only wish the actual film could keep up with it. At well over 2 hours, it was hard not to fidget and constantly check the time. The ending was just....odd. But by that point I was so past caring I didn't even try to break it apart frame by frame like I usually like to do. This is not a fantasy(or is it??) but it does containdinosaurs. Like I said; odd. I was told beforehand you will either love it or hate it and I think I know which end I am leaning on.

But looking for something positive, I always wanted to hear \\"The Misery\\" and \\"White Pearl, Black Oceans\\" LIVE, and here sounds AWESOME
B0063IH60K|4.0|Overall not a bad way to waste time. Easy to get out of ad every other game. Easy to use. There just seems to be a lot of empty space.
0811875555|5.0|For my, this is one of the most complete \\"Art of\\" books I ever seen. A lot of hand draw concept for the characters, architectural analysis to make the background to make them look like the older Disney movies, and more stuff.
B004FQX59I|5.0|JFK by Oliver Stone is an amazing film about the assassination of President Kennedy. All the more poignant since I met him when I was 17 years old.<br /><br />The information about the assassination is heartbreaking and must be seen by a new generation of Americans so they will know what a great human being he was and also what America lost.<br /><br />You will also learn a lot about the Vietnam war continuation by Vice President Johnson and why we lost an additional 50,000 plus men in the Jungles of Vietnam. A must read so we do not repeat the same.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Omnom is a cute adorable little creature! This game is clean and fun! It is good for all ages especially kids! Highly recommend this app!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I like it but I dint want to have to wait so long for things. Also the game thingys r pricy I mean seariously a green oven for 5,000
B00007LTIA|5.0|I remember getting this album when it came out. I was amazed by it. Haven't heard it in years and now since ordering it, it is still as good. Timeless. The Ritual is my favorite YES song and that says a lot from a die hard. In my opinion, during this period, they were at there peak..
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app for everything: homework, syncing receipes, ideas, and info across my computers, iphone, kindle, and husbands phone. Its perfect! Easy to use, quick to update.
B001FOPODS|5.0|The animation is amazing!  You really should watch this.  However I would recommend avoiding this dvd version and getting this instead...  'A Collection of 2007 Academy Award Nominated Short Films'  This dvd has peter and the wolf as well as many others (including madame tutli putli)  Plus it costs less. how can you lose?
B00785P2QC|5.0|what a neat way to pass time. goin on a trip to Il. &amp; will have fun passing time with this game.
0061122416|2.0|The book The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho, in my opinion, was a book worth reading, yet nothing to have high expectations for. This book set forth a lot of life lessons that are obvious and common sense. The basic plot of the story is for the main character to achieve his \\"personal legend\\". I began reading this book with the high expectation that there would be a lot of deeper meaning and plot depth. I was wrong; it was an entertaining read, but not the deep and thoughtful read I was expecting.<br />While reading this book many different settings and characters were introduced and I thought that they would all connect at the end with a much deeper meaning. Though some of them did connect the \\"deeper meaning\\" was not something that took much thought. Most of the time when Coelho was trying to reach a deeper meaning with something he wrote it was oblivious and made you expects that there was something else you should be looking for. In a conversation with the main character the alchemist says, \\"Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you will find your treasure.\\" After a quote like this I expected the Alchemist to go one saying more and more about where your heart connects to your treasure and there being a deeper mean. However I was let down where they simply explained it in an obvious way and went on with the story. Though the ideas seemed good the meaning didn't go deep enough.<br />Another thing that disappointed me with this book was its ability to connect with me. Though I can see how the life lessons apply to everyone I couldn't see myself making these same decisions. Given that I have a less risky personality probably explains why I feel this why. The main character at one point says, \\"Well, then I'll be a shepherd!\\" These are risks that I wouldn't take so I probably don't take as much out of this book as some with this persona might. Along with that the way the story was told seemed somewhat boring to me. There was basically no humor and no use an exciting vocabulary over all made reading it more boring than I would have enjoyed.<br />Coelho seems to think of himself as having a purpose in his writings .His lived as a hippy for awhile which explains his dull non-comic writing style. Though the plot of the story was good it was underdeveloped and, in my opinion, not very well written. This book is worth reading, but would not get a very strong review from me. Many things could be change to make it more exciting and meaningful.  He needs to add something to truly get me engaged in the reading. With a better deeper meaning to the lessons portrayed in the story it would have made it a more intensive read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good way to waste time, I was on a really really long bus ride and I spent hours trying to beat the games.
B006C45MRE|5.0|Cowboys & Aliens is a hoot - an interesting mix of the past and the futuristic type movies. Cowboys and Indians joined up to kick the Aliens off the planet!!!
B007H51DQG|3.0|I am a huge fan of zombie films and was excited when The Walking Dead first aired...Season 1 was fantastic...I wouldn't exactly say that the 2nd season is terrible because it does have a lot of substance to it. However, it does seem to be moving along rather slowly. There is just too much time being focused on the group and the psychological aspect of how each character is affected by what is happening around them...With all this time spent on the farm, there certainly seems to be a lack of any \\"Walker\\" action...I often feel like I am watching a daytime soap opera in the sense that there is just way too much drama...I feel that if the 2nd season doesn't begin to pick up soon as it nears it's end, I may decline to even examine the 3rd...
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really fun game. easy to play reminds me of the Sim city games. even better bcuz its free. Two thumbs way up on this game.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Lots of fun however my 4yr. old is still better then me, I'll get up to speed tho![[ASIN:B0058VW36U Cut the Rope]]
1451673442|5.0|I have read both: The Secret and The Power and today received The Magic. Started reading this book and it is as powerful and meaningful as two previous ones. Wonder when will Russian translation of this book be published, will get few for my Russian speaking friends.
0938045695|3.0|I have practiced ROSS/Zdorovye for about a decade, so I didn't find this book very helpful at all.  I feel like, for the size of the book, they could have included a lot more substance.  It is just the incorporation of movement methods into circular strength training from Russian martial art.  If you have no knowledge/experience in it, you might find the book useful.  If you do have some experience, it won't do you much good.  I'm going to sell my copy online.
B0073PZIYI|1.0|limited acting capabilites...limited direction...limited effects...limited period...I never wanted to walk away more from a movie. won't be recommending it to anyone.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I saw a preview for the movie and wanted to read the book beforehand. I am so happy I did - I had a hard time putting this book down! I loved the relationship between Logan and Elizabeth. I was not thrilled with the ending but the book kept me on my toes, waiting to see what would happen next. I cannot wait to see the movie!
B007H7XJD4|3.0|This movie is exactly what you would expect, \\"301\\". Has the same feel and look as 300 did. Does have some pretty sweet shots that make this movie entertaining enough to overlook the producers' crass take on Greek mythology.
B0073THBIK|5.0|This is an excellent book that starts slow, but gets going after the first 100 pages.  Lisbeth Salander is one of the most interesing characters ever invented and the story enables you to try to solve the mystery.  The story also involves quite a bit of sex, lesbian encounters, rape, etc., so if you are sensative about these topics it is not the book for you.  Great book and I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|A passive, TRS cable, hum reducer. Works on the low frequency stuff and turns unbalanced signals into balanced. It does what it says. Works like my Stinger[[ASIN:B002ZRQ3PW Stinger SGN20 Ground Loop Isolator]], only for TRS cables and not RCA, is also stereo. Does not reduce signal quality, in fact, without the hum, improves it. Some who complain about this should examine their cables, it's not going to fix hum from a bad cable.
1612680011|5.0|Awesome condition and delivered earlier than expected. Great self help novel. He is a genius writer. He comes from two perspectives so its helpful for anybody to read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app has great features,  esp. the radar- but the kindle will freeze up occasionally when using it. I have had to hold the power button to reboot the device more than once when using Accuweather.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is rad fashion story's terrible but this game is amazing I want to scream its so cool.!!. go restaurant story
B005K17RU0|1.0|it works perfectly fine so long as you don't open it up and try getting the future forecast. which really defeats the purpose of this app. you might as well get the weather channel app, it hasn't randomly failed on me yet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the game!!! like how there are so many options. don't like that u have to buy the next game.
0743442539|5.0|Is this a spy novel? Yes it is.<br /><br />Does that tell you what the book is like? Not really.<br /><br />I read this book today, almost five decades after it was written and it is very impressive. When I think of a cold war era spy novel I think of books full of details about the mechanics of espionage, books which impress by their knowledge of how the game is played, books which contain a thrill a minute and are full of three-letter acronyms like KGB, CIA and MI6.<br /><br />For this book though, that whole world of spy-craft and suspense seems incidental rather than central, just a context in which Le Carre places a story that is so well written that it is more about human frailties than it is about spies. In fact, the author seems reluctant to side with any one ideology, preferring to focus instead on the moral bankruptcy which the greyness and extreme result-orientedness of this world leads to.<br /><br />John Le Carre writes with a sensitivity which one would expect in an intellectual love story or a literary masterpiece, not a spy thriller. Every character is deftly painted with a little mannerism or the tone of a statement revealing something about them. It's almost as if every scene is written with a focus on its characters and not on its events. When Le Carre makes the plot take a twist, we don't marvel at the cleverness of the writer, we feel the dismay of the protagonist whose premises have just been shaken up. It is this quality of the book which makes every sentence engrossing.<br /><br />Make no mistake though, this is a spy novel with an intricate plot. While the quality of the writing will make you hang on to every word, the raciness of the narrative will  make you want to turn the pages quickly. At the end, it will leave you feeling empathy with its characters (almost all of them, on both sides of the fence) rather than identifying with the winner.
0380715430|2.0|A friend lent this book, knowing of my interest in language(s). I was sort of taken aback just from reading the bloody cover, which avers that English has more than 300 million speakers (can't remember the exact wording, but the number is correct, except that it's not even close to correct. What about India, e.g.?<br />And then to read that the word schadenfreude gives an insight into Teutonic sensibilities? Good grief!  What an insult to  many millions of Germans who developed one of the highest attainments of civilizations on earth.<br />Lib PC is a fatal curse, and Bryson is a carrier, imho.
B006ZCWU5K|1.0|FIRST OFF, I'VE BEEN A SPRINGSTEEN FAN FOR MANY YEARS AND WAS EXCITED TO PICK HIS NEW DISC TODAY.  HOWEVER, THAT EXCITEMENT TURNED TO DISAPPOINTMENT QUICKLY.  I FOUND THIS DISC TO BE VERY BORING, JUST NOT ENTERTAINING AT ALL.  IT SEEMS BRUCE IS MORE INTERESTED IN POLITICS AND SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS THAN ROCK N' ROLL.  I'LL PROBABLY LISTEN TO IT SOME MORE, LIKE NIGHTS I CAN'T SLEEP.

B0036OS3EW|5.0|This is my second pair!  I also purchased the brown ones about 2 years ago-still in very good condition.  They're very warm, cozy, totally water proof (I've put these boots to the test) and above all super comfortable.  I usually wear a size 7 - 7 1/2, and after reading some reviews to purchase half a size to a size bigger, I went with an 8-glad I did to make room for thick socks.  They're awesome!!!
B0067R0APK|4.0|love the app. hard to change home location though. I use the app daily and from multiple locations: Maine, NY,  VA, MA.
B0073Q0DZG|3.0|I enjoyed watching this movie late one evening with my husband.  While it will not make my \\"top ten\\" list, I loved the actors, story, and would recommend it to my friends.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game has great graphics. However, it can tend to get repetitive as you fly the same course over and over doing the same thing. The achievement goals help alleviate this tedium (until you get stuck). I have not yet found an option that lets me turn the sound off. Using the nuts you gather to buy items and power-ups was a great idea!

B005MMJ84K|3.0|SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br /><br />Like so many other reviewers, Delirium was one of my favorite novels of 2011 and I couldn't wait for 2012 when Pandemonium would come out. Delirium spends the whole novel getting the reader invested in Lena, her transformation, and her falling in love with Alex. The end had me dying for the next book so I could see what happened to Lena and Alex.<br /><br />Pandemonium opens with Lena escaping in the Wilds, leaving Alex behind, presuming him dead. She stumbles upon a group of the resistance and integrates into their society. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I like the \\"Then\\" segments. I thought that it was necessary to show the completion of Lena's transformation from \\"Zombie\\" to the hard, practical, strong member of the resistance she becomes. It is also the only time we really see her grieve for Alex.<br /><br />The \\"Now\\" segments follow Lena as she is sent on a mission to follow the prodigal son, Julian, of the Pro-Cure leader. This irked me because there is obviously something going on but Lena doesn't question it or push the matter. I found the fact that her resistance \\"mentors,\\" Raven and Tack, are a part of a scheme that paid Scavengers to abduct Lena and Julian is ludicrous. I find it hard to believe that they would employ the aid of a faction that is so reviled and hated by the resistance. Plus, Raven and Tack left a great deal up to chance. I found it unbelievable that Lena was able to A) make her way to Julian through the crowds, B) keep track of him once she had found him, C) find him once he had been abducted, and D) manage to make it to him without becoming a casualty herself. I thought it was unnecessary that Raven and Tack kept her in the dark when she could have performed her task so much better with more knowledge. They didn't even have to reveal everything. It could have been \\"We heard a rumor that Julian would be abducted by the Scavengers at the rally - keep an eye on him\\" and we could have still had the OMG moment later on when we discover that the resistance paid the Scavengers. And it was irritating that Lena spent so much of the novel passive, helpless, dirty, and/or passed out. We were treated to a few scenes, but I wanted to see more of the fighter she had become!<br /><br />It was entirely predictable that Lena would fall for Julian. \\"Oh my God, we're stuck in a room together and I hate you and everything you stand for but your whining and naivete are so attractive that I can't help myself.\\" I didn't connect with Julian at all. I hated that I constantly felt sorry for him because of his father, his brother, his cancer, etc. As a reader, I don't want to pity the male love interest in a novel. I especially didn't connect with his and Lena's \\"love.\\" She flipped from one extreme to the other so quickly and he just seemed like a horny teenage boy who got to touch a girl for the first time. (BTW, his peeping while she took a shower didn't seem sexy to me, it was creepy.) Everything between them felt forced and contrived. Maybe it was because I was so invested in Lena and Alex's relationship that this book just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />Now, I don't know about you, but from watching a lot of TV and reading a lot, I KNOW that when a character \\"dies\\" - unless you see the person die and then witness them being buried or burned - you can pretty much guarantee that there's a good chance you'll be seeing them again. That for me was predictable and I was not at all surprised when Alex showed up on the last page, interrupting a lovey-dovey moment between Julian and Lena. I am so tired of the teenage love-triangle in YA novels. Just because it worked in Hunger Games doesn't mean it's the best plot direction for this series. While I loved Delirium, and this series had the potential to become the next HG for me, this second book ruined it by forcing a triangle. I feel like this book would have been better without the love-triangle set up.<br /><br />However, with all that said,I *will* be reading the third book to find out what happens with Lena and Alex and to see if, hopefully, it can redeem the disappointment of this book. :(
B0054JZC6E|4.0|thanks for allowing us to download for free.  its slot of fun.. thanks again ..lots of different games to play
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is highly addictive! I love it....great for all ages!!  So much fun!!<br />I think its the new angry birds! Worth the purchase!
B0071PS7AC|5.0|I do not understand the negative reviews. It's a bowling app!! How hard can it be to play? I just played my first two games and could not believe how well I did after reading some of the other reviews. Try it for yourself. I think that you will enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|As someone who loves to game all the time I find myself returning to this nice collection of rather fun and entertaining short games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|packed with numerous translations in nearly every language you can think of, complete with numerous Bible study plans, you can tame notes, highlight, listen to audio versions, and get reminders to complete your readings! excellent app! not one complaint here! you can even download translations for offline use!
0307891372|5.0|This guide is worth the money. The game is so complex / robust that if you try to play it without a guide you will miss out on so many fun items in the game. The guide tells you everything you need to know except your own personal preferences. Normally I would just use guides / walkthroughs posted on the internet, but you really need the guide for this game. The game takes hours of your time, you might as well know what you are doing.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|In Time presents an abnormal futuristic society where time is the newest currency of choice.  Enter Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake), destined to live a life of little means, meaning he lives to gain more time, working, day in and day out, to prolong his own life and that of his mother, Rachel, played by Olivia Wilde.  If you're wondering about Olivia Wilde playing his mother, let me break things down for you.  Everyone physically stops aging at 25.  They have been genetically engineered not only to stop aging at 25 but also have an internal clock (okay, well, it's not so internal, because the countdown is visible on everyone's arm) that is counting down until the moment they die (and when they do die, it looks like they have some kind of massive heart attack, so maybe it's actually some internal bomb that destroys the heart, which, hey, since we don't get any explanations, could actually be mechanical).  In this way, it is possible for people to live hundreds of years, thus looking 25 but actually being around 38 and so on.  The catch is that they have to keep earning time by working (and lose it when making purchases, like buying food or wanting to take a bus).  When a person's clock reaches zero, they die.  The poor struggle for more time (little side conversations are dropped here and there about needing to hurry), while the rich are born and destined to live a long, long time.<br /><br />Everything changes the day Will encounters a rich and reckless Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who flashes his many years in one of the poorest sections of town, an act which incites trouble (keep a lookout for some futuristic gangsters, led by Fortis, played by Alex Pettyfer, and one of his cronies who dresses ridiculously - that hat annoyed me to death - he's supposed to look tough?) and sets this tale in motion.  Will saves his life, Henry reveals that he has lived a very long time and is ready for it all to end (he also drops some information that shocks Will but whichisn't all that shocking to the viewer), and by morning, Henry is gone, and Will has more years than he has ever dreamed of earning.  Shortly after, a tragedy happens and Will is determined to get revenge.<br /><br />While I think this movie is interesting, you have to suspend your disbelief to enjoy it.  You're told that people stop aging at 25 due to genetic engineering, and then their countdown begins (which makes it possible to live forever if characters play their cards right)...but this isn't delved into too deeply.  The subject of health problems is never brought up, so I only assume that this is such an advanced society that even cancer has been eradicated (as no one in the movie is sick; also, no one is overweight, so I guess they've taken care of obesity as well).  Along with this, the entire subject of the genetic engineering that has led to this current state of affairs is mentioned the one time and never talked about again.  Characters also exchange time (which confused the heck out of me when the film began).  They hold onto each other or use a little metal device and can take and give time (again, this is never explained and the viewer is left to speculate how this is possible).  In Time doesn't explain things.  It doesn't explain what happened to illnesses, how aging was stopped, how this genetic engineering thing works (or even how it was accomplished), how people can physically exchange time in order to gain more or give their own freely, and even how time can be used as a currency.  I think these oversights (but hey, they might have just messed the movie up even more if they had been included, maybe leading to more confusion), along with bad casting (which is covered next), are the things which ruin this movie.<br /><br />I know Justin Timberlake mainly as a singer, and, while, I'm not against singers turned actors, I wasn't overly moved by his performance or even attached to his character.  I don't think he did an awful job, but it wasn't anythingnoteworthy, either.  On a similar note, Amanda Seyfried as the spoiled Sylvia Weis (who becomes the Bonnie to Will's Clyde) manages to make herself useful only by standing around, her eyes looking gigantic and catlike, her wig very fake, and her actions very robotic; oh, and let's not forget how smart it is to wear a pair of high heels (because being stylish when you're being naughty is oh, so intelligent; and you definitely won't have to run when being on the country's most wanted list - *please note the heavy sarcasm).  On the one hand, I find the concept of time as currency intriguing, but the movie drags on and on, the acting isn't the best (though Olivia Wilde and Cillian Murphy stand out), the amount of unanswered questions I had about this society grew and grew as the movie progressed, and there was a certain inconsistancy to some of the characters.<br /><br />Tragedy takes place, Will crosses the border separating the rich from the poor, and his sadness over his loss seems to vanish (barring instances where he's moodily staring off into space, all the while - of course - being watched by Sylvia and her massive eyes).  I was enjoying the movie before he went into the richer portion of town.  Once he went there, it was apparent that this movie was going to shirk the loss this character had undergone, and throw a lot out all for the sake of a romance with no spark (and a heroine whose sudden change in opinions felt rushed and out of character).  The first scenes between Will and Sylvia were annoying and didn't go with what had already taken place in the film.<br /><br />Later, Will and Sylvia take action and start behaving like a futuristic Robin Hood/Maid Marian pairing, stealing from the poor to give to the rich.  I thought this was a little interesting, but it wasn't enough.  Cillian Murphy's character had so much potential, not only in the development in his character but because he can actually act.  Unfortunately, I think what happens with this characterwas too predictable.  It was the easy way to end things, and it was also a cop-out.<br /><br />On a more positive note, I liked the futuristic police cars, the concept of the movie was interesting (though the message behind things was overly stressed), and I enjoyed certain scenes.  I've considered whether I think this is worth a 2.5 (not possible on Amazon) or 3 star rating, and I'm going to have to go with a 3-star rating.  I liked some things about the movie.  It's very different and quite interesting, but the acting doesn't hold up (and I honestly think the inclusion of Sylvia's character is one of the downfalls of the film), there are numerous plot holes and unanswered questions, and it's more of a sit-back-don't-think-and-just-enjoy type flick.  Don't expect too much from this.<br /><br />Overall: This movie definitely won't appeal to everyone.  I think the cons largely outweigh the pros in this case, but I sort of enjoyed watching it (sort of).  This wasn't a film I hated, and I didn't love it either.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I read this after seeing it on the Today Show and hearing what a great read it was. I had never read a story that contained BDSM, however this story was not super explicit with the BDSM, therefore it truly was OK for me to read. I love the complicated relationship that takes place between the two main characters. I read the entire book in a 24 hour period and quickly downloaded the next book. I can't help falling in love with Mr. Grey. He is such a strong male character. Likewise, I love that Ana is such a strong female character. I read the whole book with a big grin on my face. Loved it!
B0071PS7AC|2.0|okay game play, but where's the story line. So I lost the first game, it shows - $100. what's the goal? are there levels? is there a point?
B004J4WNL2|5.0|1. gives very complete picture from many perspectives<br />2. concepts are easy to understand, many good examples are given<br />3. language is good and simple so non-native English speakers can read<br />4. not only useful but also fun to read

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Just finished Mockingjay, having read all of the trilogy for the first time within the last 12 days.  While I loved the first two books, the ending for the third left me unsatisified...dismayed....betrayed is probably the best word.  Ms. Collins should have gone ahead with the \\"Katniss as heroine\\" theme instead of the ending that she gave us. Another great author disappointing her audience.  I won't be reading any more of her works since I can't risk my investment in characters on her endings.
0385344228|5.0|Wow, what a great book! I know people say this all the time, but I literally COULD NOT STOP READING this book! I made the mistake of grabbing it on Kindle at 2 am, and I read straight through till six am, finishing it in time for breakfast, basically. I'm thinking Harlan Coben-good. Tess Gerritsen-good. Jeffrey Deaver-good. Jodi Picoult-good, in a really big way.And a better courtroom drama than anything John Grisham has written in the last ten years. It's a tiny story and a huge story all at once. I love first-person narrative, and Andy Barber's voice blew me away. I won't give any spoilers, just READ THIS BOOK!
B00009RAJI|5.0|This is an excellent sounding CD. The remastering is superb. Fleetwood Mac (no doubt the best line up in their long history) at the top of their game. Great song writing, fine playing, and excellent vocals. The Deluxe Edition is just that. DELUXE. Get this, you can't go wrong.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|On my first throw, I delibrately threw it out of whack just to see what the complaining was about. The second time, I aimed and threw a strike and have been doing just fine on every throw since.  Like this game so much, recommending it to family and friends. Noise is realistic and picture quality is great of Fire and nexus phone.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really like this game.I also have virtual city this is a little better than the first  the touch feature is ten times smoother.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|i really like this game. its easy to throw a curve ball, u just have to learn how to pull up the settings and the instructions with it. after u master the curve it gets pretty realistic. and from someone born and raised in Milwaukee, i know my bowling! hint: during gameplay at the right time press the upper left hand side of the screen to bring up instructions, music control and other options.

0439023521|3.0|I read this for a class, and I've got to admit, yes I was entertained. Then I realized something, I've read this before. That's right, I read \\"Battle Royale\\" when I was a senior in high school. Its good, but really, just a knock off of other novels that did it before. Sorry, but read \\"They shoot horses, dont they\\" or \\"battle royale\\" better. May get this from the library, but don't buy
B003L20IFQ|3.0|Paul Conroy, a private contractor, working as a truck driver in Iraq, wakes up after an ambush to discover he is inside a wooden coffin buried beneath the desert sand. He has nothing but a lighter, a flask with whiskey, some pills and a cell phone provided to him by his captors. He begins to make desperate calls for help as time drags on and his situation becomes more and more dire.<br /><br />This is the premise (and a large portion of the plot) of BURIED, an independent film from Spain, starring Ryan Reynolds in what is essentially a one-man show. It's a tense little thriller that is nearly spoiled by some serious flaws. Reynolds gives a fairly convincing performance as a fairly ordinary guy who begins his ordeal in a panic and only gradually finds his way to calm. At least, he's calm for awhile.<br /><br />The movie is mostly the various conversations he has with the outside world. Grappling with lost signals (and a dying battery), answering machines and a disbelieving bureaucracy. He can't reach his loved ones. He can't convince his captors that he doesn't have $5 million dollars to exchange for his freedom. There's really nothing he can do about his situation...he has no way to break free and must rely entirely on a world of people who aren't quite as motivated as he is.<br /><br />Director Rodrigo Cortes does a good job of finding as many ways of filming the events of the films as he can. His camera swoops around inside the coffin, yet we always have the claustrophobic feeling. The film has a simple premise (sort of in the way that OPEN WATER was a simple, claustrophobic little film), but Cortes and company grab all they can out of it.<br /><br />However, even though we can believe that Conroy would frequently panic and make some bad decisions...he makes too many bad choices. When he does reach people on the phone, he does an unbelievably bad job of convincing them that he really needs their help. I can believe him losing his cool once or twice...but he does it fairly consistently. And when he finally DOES reach someone who might be willing to help, he spends a lot of time sharing unneeded information. He knows his battery is running down, yet he often wastes his breath. It got to the point where I occasionally thought, \\"Well, if he dies, he has no one to blame but himself.\\" (Notwithstanding that he didn't put himself in the coffin.)<br /><br />Worst of all, though...the film manages to take some pretty nasty jabs at the mission in Iraq and make some attempts at moral relativism. One of the folks working to help Conroy, a hostage expert in Iraq, actually tries to explain away the terrorist acts as the work of people who will simply do anything to survive. \\"You'd do the same if you were in their situation, Paul,\\" this awful man says. REALLY??? If a time comes when the only way I can think to feed my family is to kidnap folks and bury them alive...go ahead and shoot me. To dare suggest that Americans would be just as bad as these terrorist extremists is a mighty big (and offensive) argument for a little thriller to make. For unsubtle, unearned and unsubstantiated political/social statements inserting themselves where they don't belong, BURIED takes the cake.<br /><br />The day after seeing the film, what I remember most is not the tension and excitement and fear...but the bad taste in my mouth from the group of Spanish filmmakers and producers who took pot shots at America.<br /><br />I mention all this, because the film is generally very effective (though not as tense as some other reviews I've read have implied). If you don't mind the politics I mention, by all means enjoy the film. If you find the premise intriguing enough that you think you need to overlook the politics...then you'll have a good time. I just wish someone had warned me.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|personally, i enjoyed this movie.  i like how close the series ended to the books.  i'm glad they stuck with the same characters throughout the series.  Great beginning to the end of an era.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I love this story so very much it is as basic as boy meets girl and as complicated as 21st Century human ignorance. I love this story simply.
B007H51DQG|5.0|It was gory in the beginning with the torture.  I dont do well with torture.  I cannot believe it was so explicit.  I was terrified for Carl.  Maybe cause I have kids, but I knew it was going to end up to no good.... a parent's nightmare.  Carl was constantly watched throught the series ...why was he left so unattended in this one.  Oh, and Dale that was shocking!  Great acting!!! Did not enjoy the torture scene ..it was too close up.
B0073PQ720|1.0|Don't watch this movie.  The guy doesn't even talk most of the movie, even when people are talking to him!  Totally stupid and a waste of money.
B0071PS7AC|2.0|this bowling game has average graphics. that is about it. it is slow paced with no way to skip the computer moves. the ball control is flawed and difficult to control. this deserves to be a free app because it is not worth money. the kindle awaits a good bowling game, for this one kinds stinks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You always want to keep playing to unlock more games! There are so many to choose from and it will keep you occupied for hours.
B006ON41FC|4.0|enjoy playing this game.  I'm having trouble getting passed a certain point it because it is really hard getting only the gold acorns. besides that its a fun game.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Another fun game from team lava.  How many neighbors can you get and how quickly can you advance?!?  Invite your friends and family!
B003YP7N9O|5.0|Very few albums 'stand up' to the passing of time.  This one is as fresh and wonderful as the first time I heard it 40 years ago.
B0067Q04AM|4.0|I am surprised by the incredibly high praise this album is receiving. It's certainly a very good album, just not quite a great one. I have read a number of reviews comparing the project to Miles Davis which is a little ridiculous to me. I've recently gotten into jazz a bit, and Miles Davis' \\"In A Silent Way,\\" \\"Bit@%es Brew\\" or \\"On the Corner\\" are leagues ahead of the sound on this album. But, they are also less accessible than Robert Glapser Experiment's more straightforward, Contemporary R&B influenced style. Though no one has combined genres in quite the way this project has, the tracks on \\"Black Radio\\" end up having a familiar sound. They are really not particularly experimental if you have explored neo-soul, a genre which has been strongly influenced by jazz and hip-hop since its beginnings. Rather than truly pushing the boundaries of the genre, it sticks close to conventions. Similar instrumentation is utilized on most tracks, with the majority being mellow songs relating to relationships. Aside from an arguable lack of innovation, the songs here are generally successful, as most are very well executed. However, the album is not without its faults. It is difficult to excuse a few significant disappointments on the album such as Yasiin Bey's (Mos Def's) limited role on the track \\"Black Radio\\", some silly lyrics by Lupe Fiasco (Ninja Turtles?) on \\"Always Shine,\\" and the droning drum beat introduced near the beginning of the Nirvana \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" cover (though I did find the song to be an interesting contribution to the album). If you enjoy mature neo-soul and R&B you will probably enjoy this, as I did. But depending on how adventurous you are in seeking out music outside of the mainstream, you may not find it particularly unique. I find myself more engaged by the RH factor's 2003 album \\"Hard Groove\\" which was based on a similar concept. With some hesitance, due to the overall quality of the project, I can give \\"Black Radio\\" four stars.<br /><br />Favourite tracks:<br />Afro Blue (Featuring Erykah Badu)<br />Cherish the Day (Featuring Lalah Hathaway)<br />Move Love (Featuring King)<br />The Consequences of Jealousy (Featuring Me'Shell Ndegeocello)<br />Why Do We Try (Featuring Stokely Williams)<br />Letter to Hermione (Featuring Bilal)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is amazing its time consuming nice music and traffics really. I'm. Happy with. This purchase many well spent. Five star for this game.
B003HFFVDQ|5.0|The Chemical Brothers can walk that line of hard, and soft. Melodic, and abstract. Loud, and quiet. Just when you think a song is about to tip one way too far, in comes a verse to pull you back in the opposite direction. That pulling back and forth creates a rhythmic undertone. One that is created alongside the actual song. You find yourself getting pulled in, and it feels like youth. It makes you want to drive faster, dance harder, and live longer. If you are not moving to this album, check your pulse.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|This thing performs as well as I thought it would.  Very sturdy and LARGE for a mid tower.<br /><br />One gripe though.. I has to buy a fan power extension cord to plug into my motherboard.  But this might be my MOBO's issue.  I do not know.<br /><br />Also, the front panel mic and headphone jacks are so tight that I have never fit anything in them.  A small issue, since my MOBO has jacks on the back.  You might want to make sure if this before you buy this unit.  I know other people have had the same issue.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|This is a movie the whole family can watch together.  It has great comedy, a little sacary and lots of laughs.
1612130283|5.0|very well written trilogy.. couldn't put it down.. want more!!!! i suggest these books to anyone... my inner goddess is jumping up and down! =)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great second book in the series. The second I finished it I had to start the third book!
B0055SWM08|5.0|played for 45 mins straight.  held my attention very addictive!  free was also good.  thanks Amazon!  I would recommend to friends!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I was looking for a series to read after I finished the Hunger Games, thinking nothing else could come close. This series is amazing as well. Fun and fast reading.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I have not opened the app and refuse to.  There is a new (annoying) update daily for this app that pops up in my alert menu!  I am being forced to view updates (adds) from amazon!!!! This is terrible.  I am to the point where I may not ever order from amazon because of this uninstallable, constant annoyance!  It is just terrible that google/android would allow something like this to happen.  After all, google makes billions because their adds are so non-intrusive.  Why would they let amazon have this much control over a user's experience????  I secretly hope that Verizon is the one who has been bought and lets this happen! Terrible, terrible, terrible.
B000M5AJQI|1.0|I started watching this with high hopes but very quickly felt let down and was pressing stop half way through. If you want to see this story done properly then get the original (Infernal Affairs) rather than this pile of trash. Why do English language directors feel they have to dumb down Asian movies when they remake them. To me this goes in the same bin as The Grudge or The ring or just about every remake of a good Foreign language film. I can only hope there isn't an American director out there hoping to remake Pan's Labyrinth.
B004P1JEWU|3.0|The Game of Thrones had been totally engaged in this world of knights, kings, passion and sword fighting, but I felt the story started to loose momentum further into the books.
B001IYVUEW|5.0|The Dark Knight Series is by far the best Superhero movies I have ever seen!!!! Loved every minute of it!
B004FOA84A|5.0|I had a such a great time with this game. However, I finished it in a little over an hour. I was so disappointed.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I wanted my 26 year old daughter to see this movie. She is at the right age to appreciate it, and did. As I hadn't seen it available on TV in forever, I decided to purchase. Great price, well-made edition, and super fast shipping. I especially enjoyed the added documentary -- seeing the stars talk about their experience in making the movie.
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|Mercury Living Presence 50 CD Collector's Box Set (Plus 1 bonus interview disc)is a collection of 47 of the early 1990 remasters of the original tapes for CD by the original engineer. This collection brings together many long out of print CDs of classic recordings of the early stereo era.<br />The album material was combined in the 1990's to take advantage of the CD's longer time limit, so these are not lp replicas, but CD reissues.<br /><br />One of the nicest put together label retrospectives available with a small but sturdy box and thin informative booklet that tells the story of the label and engineers and then has a couple pages of info on the artists.<br />The Mini LP style covers have the front cover of the CDs which was based on the orginal LP artwork and the back covers have both titles and recording info on the individual CDs. Which means once you read the booklet you can leave it in the box, because the info is on the CD sleeves.<br /><br />There are much better reviews of what's in the box already, but as someone just starting in the classical CD market, this is an excellent introduction to some core versions of the classics.<br /><br />Highly Recommended to anyone looking to add to their Living Presence CD library.<br /><br />When vol 2 comes out, and theres plenty of remastered CDs that aren't here that vol 2 seems a given, this will be known as the Dorati box and the next one will be the Paray box.<br /><br />Contents by artist.<br />CD39: Bachauer - Brahms/Liszt/Beethoven: Piano Works<br />CD4: Dorati - Works By Bartók And Kodály<br />CD5: Dorati - Bartók: Violin Concerto<br />CD7: Dorati - Prokofiev: The Love For Three Oranges<br />CD9: Dorati/MSO - Tchaikovsky: 1812 Overture<br />CD10: Dorati/MSO - Dvorák : Slavonic Dances<br />CD13: Dorati - Petrouchka/Printemps<br />CD17: Dorati - Liszt: Hungarian Rhapsodies<br />CD19: Dorati - Brahms: Hungarian Rhapsodies<br />CD21: Dorati - Copland: Appalachian Spring<br />CD23: Dorati - Prokofiev: Romeo &Juliet<br />CD35: Dorati - Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker (Part 1)<br />CD36: Dorati - Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker (Part 2)<br />CD38: Dorati - Bartók: Bluebeard's Castle<br />CD43: Bachauer/Dorati - Beethoven: Piano Concertos 4 & 5<br />CD44: Bachauer/Dorati - Chopin: Piano Concertos<br />CD45: Bachauer/Dorati - Ravel/Debussy/Stravinsky<br />CD48: Dorati - Stravinsky: The Firebird<br />CD6: Fennell - Hi-Fi A La Española And Popovers<br />CD12: Fennell - British & American Band Classics<br />CD16: Fennell - Fennell Conducts Sousa: 24 Favorite Marches<br />CD27: Fennell - Screamers March Circuses<br />CD28: Fennell - The Civil War: The Music And Its Sounds (Part 1)<br />CD29: Fennell - The Civil War: The Music And Its Sounds (Part 2)<br />CD3: Hanson - Mcbride: Mexican Rhapsody<br />CD8: Hanson - The Composer And His Orchestra<br />CD11: Howard Hanson - Grofe: Grand Canyon<br />CD20: Janis - Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos 2 & 3<br />CD22: Janis - Mussorgsky: Pictures At An Exhibition<br />CD24: Janis - Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto 1<br />CD31: Janis - Liszt: Piano Concertos 1 & 2<br />CD32: Janis/Kondrashin - Prokofiev: Pno Cto 3; Rachmaninov: Pno Cto 1<br />CD1: Kubelik/CSO - Mussorgsky: Pictures At An Exhibition<br />CD2: Kubelik/CSO - Smetana : Ma Vlast<br />CD30: Osipov State Russian Folk - Balalaika Favorites<br />CD14: Paray - Suppé: Overtures<br />CD15: Paray - Berlioz: Symphonie Fantastique<br />CD25: Pepe Romero - Flamenco<br />CD26: Romero - Royal Family Of The Spanish Guitar<br />CD50: Romero - Rodrigo: Concerto De Aranjuez<br />CD18: Skrowaczewski - Shostakovich: Symphony 5<br />CD33: Starker - Dvorák: Cello Concerto<br />CD34: Starker - Schumann: Cello Concerto<br />CD41: Starker - Bach: 6 Cello Suites (Part 1)<br />CD42: Starker - Bach: 6 Cello Suites (Part 2)<br />CD46: Starker/Sebok - Brahms & Mendelssohn: Cello Sonatas<br />CD49: Starker - Italian Cello Sonatas<br />CD37: Szeryng - Brahms And Khachaturian: Violin Concertos<br />CD40: Szeryng - SzeryngPlay Kreisler And Other Treasures<br />CD47: Szeryng - Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto<br /><br />A fantastic box set, that should be followed soon with part 2.<br />I'd like to preorder it today.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great read. The type of book that you ignore other things because you do not want to put it down. Although I felt the first book in the trilogy was the best, this one still delivered!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is soo much fun! i love it to play on my kindle! everyone loves to play this game!
0545425115|4.0|I caved and read The Hunger Games Trilogy.  They are very well written! I read all three in two days (youth fiction, so they are easy reading)and can finally return to real life (and sleep).  EXTREMELY ADDICTING!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Does just what you'd expect a solitaire app to do. Intuitive, easy to use, and fun. I recommend it without reservation.
0307454541|5.0|I started the books on a friday, and by sunday afternoon had finished the trilogy.  Sleep was not an option. Very exciting and addicting.
B006964E8S|5.0|i can see the similarities but thats where it ends. great book ..... hope for more. well done mr baldacci
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Well, what more can you say about Downton Abbey?  It's probably one of the best TV series in recent history, period.  After I watched the 2 seasons of Downton Abbey, there was a deep sense of withdrawal & emptiness - feelings I get after I read a great novel.  Many say that season 2 is more sudsy & melodramatic, but watching the 2 seasons back to back, I found them equally entertaining & satisfying.<br /><br />What makes Downton Abbey so great is the exquisite writing, acting, & costume/set design that blow almost everything else you watch on TV out of the water.  The story lines are compelling, the characters are fully realized and not just stock, & the actors who portray them are so finely nuanced.  It's a formula that can hook an audience, make them care about the upstanding downstairs characters like Anna & Bates, curse at the evil of O'Brien & Thomas, and pine for more to happen between Matthew & Mary.  Michelle Dockery, who plays Mary Crawley, is an unbelievable actress.  You can love or hate her character, but her every look and facial expression so subtly exposes Mary's emotions, that she is a big reason that people are mad about the Matthew/Mary story line.  And Maggie Smith as Countess Dowager - her delivery of lines is just impeccable & her character adds some levity to the show.<br /><br />I don't want to add spoilers but would just say that:  1)  The Sybil-Branson romance was deemed a little incredulous to some, & it did seem like Sybil overcame her feelings of ambiguity rather quickly....2)  There is one sex scene (or at least scene in bed with a couple) - but it's definitely not the couple you wanted to see!  3)  The return/appearance of mystery character P. Gordon seemed pointless - unless of course he makes a return in season 3.  4)  For people who love the Matthew/Mary arc, the Christmas episode will prove to be deeply satisfying.<br /><br />If you are watching Downton from the beginning, just take it slow & savor every episode.  If you watch it too quickly, you'll be left empty & adrift, helplessly waiting for season 3!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I will say that the beginning of the book is slow but the author does a wonderful job of bringing the world to life. I am so sad I have to wait for the next one.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|this game could have been better if they had a Vegas tourney where you can win cash instead of the hundred dollars. also if you bowl a gutter then a strike it shows a strike sign but its still scored a spare so no biggie.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is a truly great game. I picked it up when it was the faotd, but now that I have played it, I can say that I would have paid for it. I played it all the way through and enjoyed every minute of it. GNexus.
030788743X|3.0|There are two things you should know about Ready Player One.<br /><br />The first thing is that it is loaded with 80s pop culture references and trivia. LOADED. Multiple instances per page. The entire plot is driven by 80s pop culture references. If you were not experiencing pop culture during the 80s you will most likely either be very lost or very annoyed. I am actually slightly too young to be the target audience for this book because I was born in the early 80s. Ideally, the target audience for this book would have been a teenager during the 80s.<br /><br />The second thing is that Ready Player One is basically a young adult novel. The action is, like in YA novels, relentless -- the book never really slows down except for periods of 80s-related exposition. The villains are cartoonishly, unmitigatedly, straight-up evil with zero redeeming features. Relationships are simple. Characters are simple. Emotional responses to tragedy are glossed over or stereotypical. Ideally, the target audience for this book would be teenagers.<br /><br />So you see the problem, right? The people who will enjoy the pop culture references in this book are in their 30s-40s, and yet the book is aimed at teenagers.  I'm not saying it's not a fun book; it's a totally fun book! But I expected a bit more from it depth-wise, and did not get it. (That said as far as books about MMOs in the future it is like 900 times better than [[ASIN:0061977969 Reamde: A Novel]], which was a whole nother kettle of disappointing fish.)
B0071PS7AC|2.0|Worst control ever. This game mighty work better on a tablet but on my Epic4g the controls are almost impossible to get the ball down the lane without young it right into the gutter. If control options were added to adjust sensitivity and hook and slice of the ball, might work better but would still be a boring game.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is worth 6.99 .on the fact that it is a clone of world of warcraft .  If you go moblie having this game will replace w.o.w. with the 1-60 lvls and plenty of quests on order and chaos sides .. Worth the money
B000063UR2|5.0|The European and American version differ enough to make one want to watch both.  I still like the American Version better and the music of Tangerine Dream fits the movie better then Mia Farrow singing.  The story was a bit more through and you can tell where the European film was cut to make the Americanized version.  Good vs Evil, light vs dark.  This movie is well worth the whole 8 bucks they are asking for it now.  This movie and Willow is great for 10 years old and up.
B0071PS7AC|2.0|it was ok I did not enjoy it vary much I got rid of it after a few days so I would not recomend it to enyone
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some games are super silly and easy but its fun how you can unlock new games and great to pass the time! Only down fall is the ads every 3rd or 4th time you play
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game has not only been an entertainment to me, it hasalso been awesome to me!! thank yo G5 you make all my favorite games!!!!<br />love, fergo wallsight
B004VPVVKS|5.0|I listen to at least 60 hours of music a week, (Bluegrass, folk, jazz, metal you name it. I'll listen to just about anything if it's good). I saw them perform on a late night show (by chance) and reviewed the album on Amazon.  Wow!! The little samples you get don't do this album justice.  She is a wonderful song writer, a gifted vocalist and the band is tight. I like the cover of Tainted Love better than the original. Proud and humble was the song that got my attention. Kentish Town Waltz is a real treat also. There wasn't a tract on the album I disliked. This is a great mix, with the horn and upright bass, guitar style is awesome and the drummer is brilliant!  It is not over powering but mixed to a wonderful sonic blend that flows. I have listened to it everyday for a month mixed in with everything. I'm going to be a fan of this album and band for a long time to come. It really blew me away that this is a singer that I had never heard of, but I am gonna' keep an ear on!
B0071PS7AC|1.0|this game will not let me bowl anything! at first I thought I was doing it wrong but then I played and played and played! and it always went into the gutter!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|kids love it...but did force close a few times on kindle when trying to install airplane game.  but still fun and lots of games
0446563048|5.0|Change is often seen as difficult when in fact, it is a blessing for many companies. This book provides you with some extraordinary ideologies, that when embraced, can truly provide you with what I like to think of the \\"A-HA!\\" moment. Believe and value your employees and you will reap rewards you never knew existed.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|This anime easily top's most if not all other's! If you are a huge zombie fan this is for you! They really have done the wide spreading zombie fan base justice with this masterpiece. Not only can you enjoy watching the undead ravage japan but you can do it while enjoying the amazing voice acting , accurate term's for all the weapons and vehicles shown they really did there research and made sure each weapon that is mentioned is done properly to its true name and function :D. I cannot wait for season 2! They only bad thing is the price but if you want just pay 8$ and get Netflix where you can watch it online at anytime in HD :3.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|For the most part it is a good copy but it does skip and freeze in a few places. Very funny and very inappropriate in hilarious ways.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I found this book's glimpse into the world of ultra-running to be fascinating, even though it's a world I will never, ever personally experience (except maybe as a support person.)<br /><br />I really like the way the book is written. The author mixes history with anthropology, physiology, biology, autobiography and storytelling. Combined with the fascinating event(s) being portrayed, this made for a fast, easy read for me. My only criticism - and it's not much of one - is that somehow I wanted more. I can't really explain why, but I wasn't ready for it to end when it did, even though the story was \\"over.\\" Maybe by that time felt somewhat attached to some of the players and didn't want to say goodbye to them.<br /><br />All in all, I found this to be a great read ... even though it won't make me a runner.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved this book. I especially enjoyed that it felt like you were having a conversation with Tina. A conversation in which the other person never reacts to any of your questions, commentary or laughter. I'd do it again.
0061148512|4.0|I did not enjoy this book. But who does enjoy a trip into the depths of your own insecurities, inadequacies, inconsequentialness, and your second class status as a female citizen. I think this is really what drove her mad.  A woman with a brilliant mind in a world that both fears and envies an intellectually powerful female is subject to it's constant derision, and it cannot help but eat away at her soul. As my friend would say, \\"lived it.\\" So no, I did not enjoy this book.
B002RKRSV0|4.0|It took some work for me to get involved in the book. It is set in early 1900s in and around London. With those times and customs not being familiar to me, I had to concentrate on my reading, particluarly through the first half of the book, to get my grip on the story and characters, but it was worth the effort. So much happens in the characters' lives in the second half of the book, and I certainly couldn't predict the ending. It was worth the effort of my initial struggle. If you find yourself in a similar circumstance, try to wade on along, and you will be rewarded.  Although there are summaries and analysis out there to assist, I recommend going along on your own because those aids give away so much of the story line.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|For some I've read the movie was a disappointment. For me it was worth buying and watching many times. I don't usually go by what others say, always listen to my own mind and if the tv ads look promising I'll consider seeing it or buying it out right. After all, don't buy it right away, give it a few months the price will go down then buy it. Going to the movies is getting too expensive, and there hasn't been a movie I've wanted to see bad enough to actually go out to see. This movie has a sequel coming so it must be worth it. From seeing it I'd recommend it.
B001BR3ORC|5.0|A good plot that really could have happened in the 80s. Fox I dont think ever did a movie that the whole family of any age couldn't sit down and watch. One scene is a little perverted but can be passed over as \\"they took a nap\\". other than that I loved it, and have for 30 years.
B004XQO90O|5.0|Source Code was another time transfer movie, but instead of sending a whole person back they were only able to send one mans mind back, to prevent a terrorist from exploding a bomb on a train in Chicago. Another dirty bomb would follow. It was engrossing to keep me guessing throughout the movie. The man had only one thought about going back time and time again till he got it right, and that was to save the girl he'd grown to like. The ending was what got me. Once his job was done he wanted to be unplugged and left to die like his father had already been told. His mind was working but his body was half gone from war injuries and barely kept alive. When a friend did give him his request his mind was in the past where it stayed with the body he occupied. Only thing is, where did the mind of the original owner go? It never said, but the movie is great.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is a great game!  it is very addictive too.  it works very well on my kindle fire.  add me fogs81.

B005Y5L2WG|5.0|This was a great way for me to keep up with the lastest episodes of my favorite show. I will most likely to order more.
B007H51DQG|4.0|I still really like the show even though it's slowed down in pace from seaason one. It's kinda funny though that Rick as the leader has probably made more poor decisions that have killed people than the others. I can't belive Rick and Lori just let Carl roam around with no supervision as they do in this zombie world. I'm sure that their stay at the farm is coming to an end soon. I kinda hope they don't kill off Shane/Daryl since he and Daryl  are the perfect fit for this type of world. T-dog might as well be 'offed since he has done absolutely nothing in season 2 and they haven't developed him as a character at all.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Suddenly on my kindle screen appears my facebook page with a request from angry birds to write on my facebook page AS ME and obtain all the people who are my friends and family.  This really upset me, first that they could write on my facebook and second, the request that was made.  I declined to allow them to do this and then another message was posted.  If I knew how to get rid of angry birds from my kendle, I would.  This is a terrible request.  How can they do this???  By accepting a free angry birds game do I give them the authority to send me messages on my facebook page thru my kendle?? Help.  This is not right, I don't want to have anything to do with angry birds.  Please respond.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|I absolutely love The Boondock Saints, so I was super excited about this movie coming out. I remember leaving the movie theater in total confusion, just wondering how Troy Duffy could have made such a wretched movie. It's like he didn't even try. Every aspect of the film was either a thoughtless rehash of something from the first movie, or he just stole it from the generic action conventions box. This was a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE movie with lame dialogue, predictable plot devices, and absolutely none of the quirky originality of the first film. I hope Duffy dies and goes to hell for this.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Phantom of the Opera 25th anniversary Royal Albert hall dvd, is really good. I thought the cast was good, especially the Phantom and Christine, but it was surprising to me that Raoul's character seemed a bit arrogant in the story here. The production values were very good, and the picture quality is very good. Phantom of the Opera is my favorite musical.<br /><br />After the ending of the play, there's an additional 20 to 30 minutes of past phantoms and original cast being presented on the stage, including Sarah Brightman who sings \\"Phantom of the opera\\".<br /><br />Overall, this dvd is a keeper.

B004SBQGHS|1.0|Bought through amazon.  Have Android Cruz  and it wont complete installation...so I get nothing for my money....and cannot figure out where to get technical support.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I've seen many reviews for this item, and it has to be one of the most popular heatsinks sold. I don't know what I can say that others haven't already said. Some gripe about the size. It's pretty standard these days. 120mm fans are the same size no matter which heatsink they are on. I've owned several heatsinks, and this one has to be the one of the easiest to install. I'm replacing a whiny Zalman 9700 NT with this one, which I liked Zalman's mounting ring with backplate design too. I had to remove the mobo anyway to install this. The instructions are kind of confusing. I followed the pictures and found its really easy. Bracket on one side of the mobo. Push through the bolts and screw on the nuts. Place HSF on top of chip and screw down retention bracket in alternating pattern. Done. Love this design. I absolutely hate the Intel push-pin design on others. I've seen it bow motherboards.<br /><br />Backplate seems unobtrusive enough that it doesn't interfere with components on the back of the mobo. I had a problem with another model with a universal backplate that I was trying to mount on a EVGA 780i FTW mobo. The backplate hit the NB heatsink mount on the back and prevented it from sitting correctly.<br /><br />People have mentioned memory clearance issues. Must be on AMD based boards. I have it mounted on a Gigabyte GA-EP45-UD3P with no issues. It's even in a crappy cheapo case with the PSU at the top and the HSF clears everything with 1/8\\" to spare. In my AMD rig, I have a Xigmatek S1283 that is very similar to this one. I have to use low profile memory otherwise it hits the bottom of the aluminum radiator. As it is, it prevents me from removing memory from 2 slots. HSF mounts 90 degrees clockwise on a AMD socket compared to Intel. Xigmatek used the dreaded push-pin design for this, luckily I am using it for AMD, so it still uses the stock clipping system. I think its possible to rotate this so that the HSF is oriented towards the back, though I haven't been able to test this. Not true of the S1283, unfortunately.<br /><br />How well does it work? Great! I was running 45C+ on full load with a Q9550 @ 2.83Ghz with the Zalman 9700. Single fan brought it down to the low 30s. I've added a second fan and brought the Q9550 up to 3Ghz. 39C full load, 26C idle. Impressive for air!<br /><br />Lastly, I liked it so much I bought a second for another project I am working on.

B0071PS7AC|4.0|to everyone saying u cant win or controls are too hard is full of it. controls are easy. you can just drop the ball and it goes perfectly straight. i got a strike first throw and beat the chick by 70 pins. its not overly difficult and controls are simple and intuitive. Hate watching the cpu bowl but if u think about it u wouldn't just want it to say she got a strike if u didn't get any proof.
0470601787|5.0|A Dutch friend of mine once referred to the practice of using slides presented from a PC as \\"poofterpoint\\" ... I take it that his comment was indicating that they lacked power in presentation.<br /><br />The same cannot be said for this book. Having sat through pages and pages, days and days of meetings with more and more slide presentations on the projector I am really looking for something to break the tedium and this is it. I recommend it.
006197806X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this YA novel, the second in Lauren Oliver's dystopian trilogy about Lena. The pacing was excellent, and Lena's internal monologue is thoughtful and interesting. The book shifts back and forth between \\"then\\" (her time in The Wilds, trying to survive) and \\"now\\" (her time in New York City, working for the resistance). The very end of the book was a surprise and a bit of a disappointment because I like Lena's new love interest, but the cliff-hanger also makes me eager for the final book in the trilogy. I think these books are much better than The Hunger Games (which I also liked, incidentally).
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the whole book.  So much better than the show.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|gameplay is horrid. no matter where i aimed or how you throw the ball it goes straight to the left gutter. even when its said all the way to the right. dont waste your time even as the free app of the day
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I must say that  I was impressed with how fast I recieved the item. I am very satisfied with the item and it was as listed
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|I received this set from Amazon.uk (Great Britain, about two weeks ago.) I'm very pleased with it. I'd like to have a complete list of the Mercury Living Presence CDs because I wish to purchase all of them! When I eas a youngster in 1960 I purchased the 1812 Overture disc on LP and really enjoyed it. Later I obtained several more of them. Now that I have a much better appreciation of classical music, I realize that these performances are really the best because the recording techniques are the simplest and therefore, the cleanest for sound reproduction. Three microphones, one at center and one each at right and left are all you need. Wilma Fine realized this. So did Thomas Edison, who in 1902 put out a line of wax two minute cylinders based on one recording horn, which gave him the clarity which today amazes people who have never before heard an Edison cylinder!<br /><br />But there is another reason to buy this set. If you are not familiar with classicsal music, get this one! I'm doing the same thing with the Mercury Living Presence series because I'm exposing myself to a lot of the music pieces I've never heard before. In high school in 1961, I took a music class that turned me on to classical. I've not looked back. I support my local station, KBAQ, in Phoenix, in Arizona, Classical music is so uplifting and enjoyable if you will only relax and let it penetrate your mind. Just try it!
B004QX07G4|3.0|This book is basically a collection of a lot of random thoughts and is kind of a book about not much at all.  Her attitude about life is fantastic, which is why I wanted to read it in the first place.  But I was kind of turned off by how many much she tries to sell the book in the book.  The reader is already reading it.

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Yet another visually captivating addition that leads to a wonderful conclusion of the Harry Potter series! Every new release met the standard that was set by the prior films and this movie is a welcome addition. Now that the series has ended, these movies have to be watched several times just to catch every detail that has been woven into the fabric of the whole story. The visual effects constantly raise the bar and the story still leaves you wanting more. I loved the ending and hope that someone steps up to fill the vast void that will surely be left by J.K. Rowling.
B004YXE438|5.0|Can you tell me how to upload photos?  I select from a folder but don't know what to after that.  Thanks.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|Works fine on Evo 4g. I just finished my first game and will play it again soon. I got this as the FAOTD, but worth $0.99 in my opinion. Great job.
B0063IH60K|1.0|ads would keep popping up. super annoying. solitaire. part is as expected and just fine. I got rid of it Bc of the pop ups
B003N7ORNI|3.0|The book is funny and entertaining, but there is just a little too much nonsese for my taste. It is different from reading a Harry Potter, for instance, in which you have a whole world of fantastic things, filled with magic, but it is still believable while you are reading. With this book, I kept thinking all the time how absurd some things were (it was probably the author´s intention, but it didn´t really work for me). Anyway, an ok book.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|I always enjoy Judy Picoult.  It was a really good book, however I felt the end was a bit too neatly tied up.  A happy ending just to wrap it up.
0062082353|5.0|This book is very good.  Its an autobiography so it covers Chris Kyle's life outside of the military as well as his experiences in the SEALs.  He is a true American hero.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|The watch worked very well for three runs, after that it simply \\"died\\". According to the technical assistance, it cannot be repaired since the damage is a fatal fail in the main part (manufacturing defeat) according to the official Technical Assistance of GARMIN in Brazil.<br />GARMIN agrees in replacing, if Amazon gives a VAT Invoice, but so far, Amazon said they will not provide this document.<br />Can someone help me on this?
B000LC55F2|3.0|Some things made this movie OK and some things made it kind of annoying.  Bad first.  Christian Bale, what a boar.  His whole presence is kind of loathsome and false.  If there was a sympathetic character it would be Hugh Jackman's character.  So I found it rather disappointing in the end that he loses and not the other way around.  A rather unsatisfying ending that lacks justice, considering that Bale's character starts the whole feud initially by carelessly causing Jackman's wife's death.  Gonna have to throw Caine's performance in with that of Bale's as well.  I was not impressed by the acting and the crappy English accents.  The story however has moments of interest of the kind that decent science fiction is likely to arouse.  David Bowie actually put in a pretty good performance as Dr Tesla.  If there was a was a hero I'd have thought it to be Jackman's character.  I actually could stand watching him (unlike Bale and often Caine whose characters just seemed so \\"put on\\" and finally just annoying).  Anyway, 3 stars for acting.  The story (minus the lame ending) I actually give 4 stars as I liked the injection of real sci-fi (in the name of \\"science\\" of course) into the mix and it raised philosophical questions about the ethics of \\"murdering an immediate and exact replica of yourself\\" - do you have the right to do it?  The movie seems to tell us no and perhaps they are right.  Fortunately science hasn't advanced to the stage where immediate clones are a possibility, but it does make you think a little (and only a little).  So the flimsy concept of the movie is half entertaining though still a bit longish at times.  I'd have forgiven the longishness if the acting (and accents) had been more worthwhile, but there was only so much of the Christian Bale character's nonsense that I could take which made those longish moments all the longer.<br /><br />It's a half decent film with some entertainment value, but if it won any awards for acting I would be extremely surprised.
B0071PS7AC|2.0|not great graphics, slow gameplay, bad AI, overall not a great game, if you want a real bowling experience with good graphics and realistic physics with customizable bowling balls you should try PBA Bowling 2, I've had it for over a year and I still think It's the best bowling game on android.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think the reason why I want to do this because its fun and pluses this is the first thing I ever had
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I throughly enjoyed the writing style. She told an intresting story. I have always been interested in the<br />life style of earlier times and this book(I hope it is factual)presented a interesting a vivid detail of the times. I would didinately read another one of her books.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|There's not much that is needed to be said about this case other than it fits the Kindle Fire perfectly and it looks fantastic.  The speakers are not covered up and the ports/button at the bottom are accessible.  The top cover forms nicely with the shell when it's closed.  Very satisfied, would definitely buy one again.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use it every day and the option to solve math problems helps this sleepyhead really wake up!  Also, the gradual increase in volume is less obtrusive than other alarms.  Awesome free app!
B007H51DQG|4.0|So this Episode was a long Drag, but it was a Must to point out as the Show progresses. Dale makes a true point about his case and what would happen if they become the judge, jury, and executioner to the kid. I was disappointed on how early they killed off Dale, i was hoping he got bit and they would have to chop off his Leg. darn, and if only we had a chance to meet the hunters ( Cannibals) But this show has more to show for itself with plenty of characters  to come in and out. It's not about killing a bunch of zombies its about survival, staying sane, and to finally start living.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game overall with lots of mini games to choose from. I give it 4 thumbs up!
B006ISJQ3K|5.0|I think theses expanded issues are great!  There are always songs recorded for an Album and then shelved Its about time they were heard  I have all the expanded issues Of Diana Ross and this is one of the best.  The Packaging is awesome with a quite thick little booklet to go along  Plenty of unreleased material here also  If you're a fan this, re-issue is a MUST for your collection
B0071PS7AC|5.0|This is easy to play and the graphics and sound effects  are good.  Intuitive game play.  Love playing against a virtual opponent.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love playing this game!! it keeps me doing something, that I like. its cool how its like u actually own ur own restaurant and u have the money and make the different foods. it is kind of weird how it can take up to like 2 days to make something though....I always get on this game when I'm bored and it keeps me entertained and interested :)
B0071PS7AC|5.0|I would of gladly paid for this app! I got 5 strikes in row one of my games. I highly recomend this as it is awesome!<br />Marla from Iowa
B00000JLWW|5.0|This is great, great movie that you will watch often year after year!  Really good and beautiful movie. I still thought that Leo and Kate should have won for the best actor and actress that year.  Oh well.  I tried to find it on DVD to replace vhs since it's getting old at many stores and they didn't have it.  I still have VHS and still fine even after 12 years.  Wonder if they will have it on DVD soon? Also, I wished that they included only real life black passenger, Joseph Lanache who were on Titanic with his French wife and their two daughters in the movie. Joseph Lanache went down with Titanic and his family were saved by going into one of the 20 lifeboats.  May every Titanic Passengers find their peace on the world's most famous Titanic on their 100th Annversary.<br /><br />\\"1,500 people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us. Six were saved from the water, myself included.  Six out of 1,500. Afterward the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but wait... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would never come.\\"
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|\\"Wrecking Ball\\" closed the hatch on John Lennon's August 1966 remark that the Beatles are \\"more popular than Jesus.\\"  With Federici accordions-away and Clarence tooting ram-horns in heaven, \\"Wrecking ball\\" established Bruce Springtseen's art as greater than the Beatles, and after shepherds in the fields of Judea listen to \\"Rocky Ground,\\" they'll follow this star to the nearest record shop.
B00004U8JU|5.0|Everything went very smoothly from the moment I ordered to the moment we watched the movie with our son.<br />Thanks!
6305090564|4.0|While it hardly wins points for originality...\\"Deep Rising\\" is my kind of fun.  It tells the story of a merc crew led by Treat Williams who are looking for a deep salvage gig and instead agree to a robbery on a luxury cruise ship.  While the movie is equal parts \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Aliens\\", \\"Deep Rising\\" is an old school monster movie with excellent special effects, good actors and an exciting score by the late, great Jerry Goldsmith.  Stephen Sommers (The Mummy) has fun with his glorified B movie.  While I'm glad its a blast script wise, the cool spfx make it a blast, and it just has an old school creature feature feel that makes it well worth the purchase price. The sound design is booming and fun and it just needs to be released on blu to make the experience complete.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|really love this one.  I use it to write essay and take notes in class.  also the calender is so good too that's how I keep up with my busy life.

B006LEHOL2|5.0|There aren't many singers who can open a song with \\"I wanted to change the world, but I could not even change my underwear...\\" and then a few minutes later - stop your giggling in its tracks by moving you to tears. But then Sinead O'Connor has always been impossibly special - and at times - a complete space cadet.<br /><br />Newly signed to One Little Indian Records - 2012's \\"How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?\\" is a hugely accomplished record - and more importantly - it's a moving one.<br /><br />The opening number is catchy enough - a clever ditty on marriage called \\"4th And Vine\\" (and a potential single), but the haunting \\"Reason With Me\\" is different. It's beautiful and its message about knowing that you need to seek help is incredibly moving (lyrics from it title this review). \\"Old Lady\\" grows on you like mad - an upbeat winner - as does \\"Take Off Your Shoes\\" with its religion and reverence. \\"Back Where You Belong\\" is properly great - a gorgeous melodious vocal with a drum rhythm that feels like a march towards something spiritual. It's followed by the joyful single \\"The Wolf Is Getting Married\\" (recently aired with such confidence on The Graham Norton Show on UK TV to a rapturous audience response). The witty and angry \\"Queen Of Denmark\\" (a John Grant cover from his album of the same name) has superlative lyrics (mentioned above) and is a blindingly good interpretation. It's followed by a powerhouse of hurt and longing called \\"Very Far From Home\\" where she pines with a stunning emotiveness \\"I long for you...see you in my dreams...\\" The last two tracks \\"I Had A Baby\\" and \\"V.I.P.\\" suffer a little from being too preachy, but are powerful stuff nonetheless.<br /><br />To sum up - like John Martyn, Bruce Springsteen, Joni Mitchell, Peter Gabriel, Paul Simon, Kate Bush and so many other great songwriters with brains and heart and the courage to wear their world on their sleeve for all of us to see - there is 'always' magic in their latest offering - that track that simply floors you - touches your soul even... Well folks - Sinead O'Connor is back with an album chock full of them - and I'll openly admit that many of them left me in tears of admiration. \\"How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?\\" is a bit of a blinder frankly.<br /><br />Way to go you gorgeous woman...<br /><br />PS: the UK issue has a card wrap outside the 'painting' artwork of the US issue - it's different.simply floors you - touches your soul even...

B002QE3CTY|3.0|This book while having some good action at points has overall left me dissapointed. I bought it on my kindle because of a recomendation from a friend thinking i might as well try it. At most points of the book (and even throuout the series) the reader is left with little to no information on any of the characters, or even their thoughts i personally found myself skimming the book especially during dialogue. Eventually during the series you will certaintly come to realize that these characters are just lab rats and have even less depth and personality.I certaintly would not reccomend this book or any book from this series.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I've just finished reading this book and felt I had to come back to review it. It is beautifully written, and yes, very much worth the hype and it's place on the bestseller list.<br />My favorite line in the book is towards the very end. \\"This is not magic. This is the way the world is, only very few people take the time to stop and note it.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun and different, and plus they are something to do. it is an interesting little app for.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|The only real disappointment for me in the saga was #2.  However, the rest have been unique with excellent supporting actors and Ms. Beckingsale is superb!  The \\"Awakening\\" delivers and it thrills me that there are rumors of a 5th movie.<br /><br />\\"Awakening\\" was intense from the opening moment and never slowed down.  The daughter was amazing and brought the maternal side of Selene out and the introduction of the new coven, the son especially, added so much.  The police officer was also a good supporting actor.  Bad guy was also awesome.  Out there, but awesome.<br /><br />Althouth, there was the typical good vs. bad, but they did it with finesse.<br /><br />I would give it a 5.  Keep in mind, I am an avid follower of these movies.  Best vampire and werewolf movies of the day!

B006JJBFK0|5.0|There have already been a few releases in 2012 from female fronted symphonic metal bands and none are as epic or great as Xandria's new release. Having been a fan of Nightwish for almost a decade, I can easily say, this CD leaves them in the dust. After Tarja's departure, they did go a bit more mainstream with a tinge of pop. However, this new release from Xandria reminds us all what it is like to listen to symphonic metal with a frontwoman who can actually sing and hit the high notes.<br /><br />If you loved the old Xandria, chances are that this won't be your cup of tea. It isn't really anything they have done before. However, if you miss the old Nightwish or want something a bit harder edged than Sirenia, Nightwish or Leaves' Eyes, then this is it. The guitar solos are nothing less than amazing and the overall production is top notch with a soaring orchestra.<br /><br />There isn't a weak track on this release, so whichever one you listen to is as good as any other. I think some of the standout tracks coming from this release are \\"A Prophecy of Worlds to Fall\\", \\"When The Mirror Cracks\\", \\"Blood On My Hands\\" and \\"Forevermore\\". All songs are quite heavy with soaring vocals that really make this band stand out from the others. I have listened to all of the new releases from symphonic metal bands and none can compare to these guys. If you loved old Nightwish or just love bands with a good balance of symphonic and metal, then this is for you! This CD will not disappoint and it is safe to say that if Xandria continues on this path, they may even take the symphonic metal crown.<br /><br />*The only thing I didn't like is that the CD comes in the digipack paper case which doesn't hold up well over the years. I take superb care of my CDs, but jewel cases are much easier to care for.
B007H51DQG|3.0|I still love watching the Walking Dead and most likely will keep watching it for some time however it does get annoying that many of the characters just seem absent from the picture at times or don't have much to say in the episodes.  I feel if they really wanted to they could film different scenes giving us more in depth insight to the other characters and how they feel at times.  I barely even know anything about the black guy?  I mean he's the only black guy in the group and I was hoping he would have some cool attributes to bring to the group but they have him as a prop practically?  Seriously?  Ever since the farm, Daryl seems a little here and there and not included as much.  I think that guy is so interesting to watch, yet they are filming some retarded girl in a bed getting five star treatment because she can't take the pressure.<br /><br />Lori talks about the nights getting colder indicating winter is approaching and you would assume they would be trying to gather supplies or ensure they can make it through the winter but so far this entire idea of surviving seems to take a seat while they debate this guys fate because they can't figure out what the hell they want to do with him.  I get the whole concept of feeling the pressure of deciding his fate but my God do we need to drag out the entire episode over it?  Should of been less than 1/4 episode discussing this guys fate.<br /><br />The point im trying to make here is there is TONS of stuff they can pack into an episode.  If they want to drag the cast staying on the farm for so long at least have them explore, gather, go on missions anything to where we don't have to watch a Post Apocalyptic U.S Congress argueing over a bill for a month.<br /><br />Any how I thought the ending of this episode was descent but it happend all at once and felt most of this episode was just some what boring.  They've had some exciting episodes this was'nt one of them :(

Because of this I haven't see much in the way of weight loss (at the end of the program I am down 6 lbs), however the change in my body shape has been DRAMATIC.<br /><br />In addition to modifying the cardio to work for me, I have also gradually increased my weights as well as added ankle weights. My friends ask me over and over again if I'm sure my scale is right (it is, as is the scale at the doctors office).  I did the work out 6 days a week, and moved up a level every 10 days (I did not count the days which I did not excercise either because it was my rest day or a sick kid needed me and kept me from my workout...  which has only happened a couple of times).<br /><br />I haven't been this toned since I started having children many years ago, and while I am clinically overweight I do not look it.  Not bad for an almost middle aged mother of 6 children (the youngest being just 16 months)!  I am very very pleased with the results of these workouts and am now trying to decide which Jillian Michael's program to try next in order to push my body further and get these last 20 lbs off.  I can't wait to see the rockin' body I've worked so hard for!
B00005O3VD|5.0|My life was changed,at 8 years old, when I walked into the theater to see, \\"Funny Girl, for the first time in 1968. It was amazing how Barbra Streisand as Fanny Brice could have that much of an impact on an 8 year old. Barbra Streisand's performance was a life altering experience from her first line:\\"Hello, Gorgeous\\" to her devastating finale of \\"My Man.\\" I had never been so deeply moved by anything I had seen prior in my life and treasure the film to this day.<br /><br />I remember as a child it played in Metro Detroit, at the grandest theater, on a Roadshow Engagement for a year and a half and we would go every Saturday. I was very lucky to be surrounded by many Barbra fans. It was after seeing that performance I knew there was a reason to wake up in the morning. I always tell people until I saw \\"Funny Girl\\" I viewed the world in Black and White. When I walked out of the theater, after viewing for the first time, I saw the world in color.<br /><br />What made it so unique is, we were seeing Barbra Streisand's career unfolding as it was happening. The musical number \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" was like seeing the pre-cursor to the MTV video. It was the first time in a film where the song did not stay in a stationary place yet started in a train station in Baltimore and took you to Barbra on a tug boat to meet Nick Arnstein(Omar Sharif).<br /><br />I remember one night, after Barbra won the Oscar for the film, we were at the dinner table bantering back and forth for which scene she won the Academy Award for and my Mother piped in and said: \\"Honey, she won it for every frame of film in the movie!\\"<br /><br />For those of you whom have not seen \\"Funny Girl\\" I recommend it as a MUST see as you will never see a film debut or performance like this ever again. It won't be the exact same experience one had as they were watching her career unfold as it was happening as she also did the \\"My Man\\" finale live(No play back) and the results are astonishing. When she finishes that scene every emotion in your body has been touched, as she puts everything in her being into that number.<br /><br />Streisand's performance is flawless from start to finish and the score by Jule Styne with lyrics by Bob Merrill is timeless. What's great about the DVD restored version is they put a ton of money into it. It starts with a montage of the movie then the menu is a marquee. They included the entire Overture, intermission, E'nteracte and the exit music. There are also some great bonus treats as well.<br /><br />I give this film 5 plus stars for Streisand's outstanding performance and William Wyler's direction. Herb Ross, did a magnificent job on directing all the musical numbers and the supporting cast is all top drawer with excellent set design and art direction. The story is great and each musical number is a revelation. This is Barbra at her best!!! Buy it today, it will cheer you up when you are down. It will touch each emotion in you from hysterical laughter to tears. They could not make this movie today if they tried, as there is no one with the talent of Barbra Streisand to recreate the role.<br /><br />For those that do not know this, Barbra Streisand originated the role on Broadway in 1964 and became the toast of Broadway. They have tried for year to do a revival, yet cannot find anyone with all the skills needed to pull off the part. They most recently were going to finally bring it back to Broadway this Spring with Lauren Ambrose(From \\"Six Feet Under)as Fanny Brice.  However,the show was cancelled in late November as they realized that Ms. Ambrose was not up to par to pull off and the producers pulled out. This was after Lauren had already been rehearsing for over a year. The theater was booked. The poster created and the supporting cast all in place. Bobby Conavalli was going to play Nick Arnstein, yet they decided it was not up to par.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I do not think they will ever find another Barbra Streisand to play this part?  So,do yourself a favor, buy the DVD and sit back and watch the performance of a lifetime.  I have selected a few of the best Barbra Streisand movies and concerts for my product link.  Check them out as they are all masterpieces, to me, as well.

B004D0YB4Y|5.0|I am 62 years old and grew up listening to Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Wilson Picket, Joe Tex, Eddie Floyd and of course James Brown.  This guy can sing with all of those guys and it was so exciting to hear this kind of great soul music again.  Horns, back up singers and wailing.  I am going to see him live in a couple months and I can't wait!  Ironically, the single they seem to be selling as an MP3 is not representative of the rest of the disc.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Got it for the kids when I need them to sit quietly. Got bored one day and played. I ass addicted immediately. I even got my sister to challenge me.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|My laptop is only a year and a half years old, but I noticed it getting hotter and slower recently. So on advice from some online sources I decided to reapply thermal paste.<br /><br />Couldn't have been happier with the results. I was hitting around 82*C before, and now only topping at about 77*C. That doesn't seem like much except for normal browsing has dropped by about 10*C.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|there are many games I haven't played every single one of them yet. its alright the ones I have played on the other hand. it'll keep you busy?:)
B0071PS7AC|3.0|graphics are weak and gameplay is basic, app works though, doesnt<br />seem buggy. i will probably uninstall and look for a better free bowling app on getjar or google.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I got this game today and played it with the expectation that I was going to get my hind end handed to me on a plate. And I did...my first game. Second game I won as I figured out how to throw the ball - how easy or hard - curve or no curve etc. But what REALLY gave me the edge and allowed me to beat my opponent was when I cleaned my screen even while playing the game. I started out with 10 points my first 2 frames due to cleaning my screen but after that I was getting strikes and spares pretty consistently. So try cleaning your touch screen and then play the game. Unless you are just really horrible at the game you should notice an immediate improvement in your game play.<br /><br />PS - to the developers - the one pose you have the girl in when she's got a hard roll coming makes her look like she has to go to the bathroom (the pose where her hands are crossed by her thigh) - you may want to fix that - or not as it doesn't affect gameplay other than me wanting to tell her to take a bathroom break :)
B0071PS7AC|4.0|this game isent that bad its super easy to win and if u get good at it, it could be hrs of fun
B0068TL23G|5.0|I don't play games on my phone, but when my kids are bored while my wife and I are trying to have a nice dinner, there's nothing better than an educational puzzle game like Router. This game is so straightforward that my 5-year-old figured it out on his own. Kudos to the developer.
0385534639|5.0|This book was a Christmas gift and sat on a table in my living room for a month and a half before I bothered to pick it up. Once I started reading it, however, I couldn't put it down. It is a magical book, full of beautiful imagery, illusion, and well-developed characters. The whole time I was reading this book I marveled at how the author ever thought up the plot and the scenes and the illusions. What an imagination she has! The story is set in the late 1800s to early 1900s in Europe and the US, and begins with two old illusionists, one who works as a magician. The magician has just discovered he has a young daughter who is now his to raise since her mother has died. He quickly discovers she has powers similar to his. He challenges his colleague to a competition. His colleague adopts a young boy from an orphanage who also has some powers. Then both men train these two young people for this competition, but the kids don't know what the competition is or who their opponent is. As young adults, they both become engaged in the creation of a circus. A magical circus, which shows up unexpectedly and is only open at night. These two young people are very much involved in creating and maintaining the illusions in this amazing circus, unawares, at least for a while, that they are opponents and that the circus is somehow part of the competition. A great book. I highly recommend it.
0525478817|5.0|This book is not for everyone. But for those who can handle the stark reality of Cancer it is a must read. It is amazingly written and insightful. You will be laughing, crying, fearing,angry,hoping and every emotion in between. It takes on a subject that most \\"Adults\\" can't handle so \\"hurray\\" for the author who realizes that \\"young adults\\" are not only smart but dealing with life issues everyday. Let's stop writing crap for them and give them what they deserve.<br /><br />I have a lot of experience with cancer. My Mother, Sister and Father died from it and I have also gone through it. The indignity of disease is obvious to all but the dignity of the fighter, whether one lives or dies is not so obvious. FEAR made it incrediblely awful for my family members. Not wanting to know, denial, inability to ask for help and with help comes some of the dignity that is missing from our characters at times. Where is hospice? I read about the meds but not about any help outside of the family. When I was told I had lung cancer I faced it head on and check out all the info, reading a survival rate of 14% was not easy but then I thought about it and decided I would be one of the 14 out of 100 who survived. Its a choice. It's always a choice. Whether I lived or died I wasn't going down without a fight!<br /><br />Augustus speaks about the Great \\"S\\", that something in the universe that gives us hope in a hereafter. I decided that it's a 50-50 shot that there's Something else. So why not believe in Something. I have never seen an atheist who handles death well, but I see people who are spiritual tackle incredible obstacles well. Life can be tough and great and most of the time boring but I'm a fan as are both the main characters. I don't think anyone gives it up easily and that's because in the end life is awesome and death definitely seems to suck.
B004NROYUI|5.0|This case is awesome. I got it as a present so not sure which store it came from, but it came in a nice black box and I'm pretty sure that mine is authentic as it's very well designed! I've read some people got a fake one that doesn't fit their camera perfectly... it should, mine does, and that's the whole point of a case like this!<br /><br />From completely protecting your camera to taking a picture is 1 second. You just lift the magnetic flap on the bottom and lift the front protection over and under. You can even put the lens cap away and use this case instead as you walk around. The front center part is flat and hard so the lens is safe. The case is made of two parts. And you can remove and put back the front part very quickly as it's secured by two snap buttons. I usually take it off and put it in my backpack as it's kind of weird the way it's just hanging down there...<br /><br />The bottom part is also easy to remove/put back, and you need to do that when you wish to change the battery or the card. Bottom is nice and flat so you can set the camera on the concrete without scratching the fragile aluminum. This camera is so easy to show signs of wear even after a gentle use when not using it with the case. The aluminum (or whatever metal this is) is like a dent magnet. Slightly brushed against it with my keyboard the other day and it got a scratch... but whatever, the camera is a tool even if this one's also a good looking one. Using this case looks like will keep it in one piece for a longer time, which is a good thing because I love this camera and it doesn't have any alternatives on the market at the moment.<br /><br />I like the case because it's there when you need it and quick to get out of the way when you want to take a picture. Oh and it maintains the same style as the camera.
B000002L61|5.0|I just had to buy this CD as I owned it years ago on cassette. I almost bought the greatest hits but I already own the Sacred Heart & Holy Diver CD's and a few Rainbow CD's. This is a great listen!
B0041I0N9A|5.0|This is a great set! It took two of us one whole night and one morning to finish building the whole thing. Over half way through, we realized that we were missing one piece but we were able to manage and put in replacement. We contacted lego and they mailed us the missing piece a couple weeks later. It was lots of fun putting together. Definitely worth getting.

0307352145|5.0|Many introverts spend their entire lives pretending to be gregarious, socially adept extroverts; they put on this facade to help navigate through the challenges that confront them, practically out of the womb.  By the time the typical introvert has made it through high school, they may have fooled themselves that they're really the happy-go-lucky free-spirited social butterfly they portray to their peers.  The rationale for this type of behavior is simple:  Extroverts are perceived to have a better chance of attaining long-term happiness and success.<br /><br />The truth of the matter is, nearly half of those appearing to be extroverts are in fact, introverts, as the author of this quietly engrossing book, Susan Cain, observes.  Rather than trying to modify their outward behavior to gain acceptance from the masses, Cain encourages the introvert to embrace the strengths that are inherent in this largely misunderstood personality trait.<br /><br />This book picks up nicely where a couple of other wonderful books on the subject left off; both were read and reviewed by this introvert a couple of years ago; if you want to really delve into the subject, I'd encourage you to read Laurie Helgoe's [[ASIN:1402211171 Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life Is Your Hidden Strength]], as well as Nancy Ancowitz' [[ASIN:B004Q1IH90 Self-Promotion for Introverts 1st (first) edition Text Only]].

B005SAZFWK|3.0|This somewhat sweet, somewhat creepy coming of age movie is worth watching for its quirky humor and for the sincere acting of its young cast. It is set in South Wales in the mid-1980s. By way of local color, there are some nice shots of the seashore, the hills, the local junkyards and railway depots and deserted industrial plants.<br /><br />We meet Oliver, a somewhat thoughtful, somewhat geeky kid of around 15 anxious to avoid bullying, if necessary by joining in against even more vulnerable targets. His love interest is Jordana, a cute classmate with an independent streak. Both of them have problems at home.<br /><br />Oliver's parents are bizarre, each in their own way. His father seems to be in the grip of clinical depression; his mother is obviously frustrated and somewhat attracted by a creepy neighbor who practices a form of \\"new age\\" therapy to do with light. Both are hopelessly awkward and inept with their son.<br /><br />We learn later that Jordana's mother may die of a brain tumor, though when we meet her, she seems amazingly healthy. This is one aspect of the plot that totally fails to work.<br /><br />Oliver earns Jordana's respect when he submits to a beating for refusing to call her a \\"massive slut\\". But then he loses it by failing to show up at the hospital where her mother has just undergone surgery. The two break up -- and we watch Oliver try to go through the painful mournful process we all go through when our first love affair dies. At the same time, he makes increasingly desperate and ill-judged attempts to save his parents' marriage.<br /><br />In the end, all these matters are resolved and the characters walk off into the sunset.<br />I quite enjoyed it, my wife did not. I think it's worth watching on an evening when there's nothing on the TV and when you can't stand yet another reality show.

B006ZCWU5K|3.0|\\"Wrecking Ball,\\" Bruce Springsteen's first record in three years, has been met with considerable anticipation by fans over the previous months. Described in various interviews as his `angriest' record to date, as well as his most diverse and experimental sounding in years, many fans were hoping for another top shelf effort from The Boss.  Unfortunately, despite his best efforts, \\"Wrecking Ball\\" doesn't reach the lofty heights many had hoped for.<br /><br />It's not that it's bad. The record is a definite improvement over 2009's lazy \\"Working on a Dream\\" (\\"Queen of the Supermarket?\\"), and there's a lot to commend about it. The most striking compliment that can be given is to produer Ron Aniello, who replaces Brendan O'Brien at the helm. Aniello gives the songs the kind of breathing room that O'Brien never was able to achieve; the compressed, ear splitting loudness of \\"Magic\\" and \\"The Rising\\" are now replaced by a smoother, better separated sound that lets each instrument shine and allows for the more subtle touches to be better appreciated.<br /><br />The record also lives up to its promise of being `experimental.' Musically, it's an excellent record, and there is really no Springsteen album that sounds like it; part Seeger Sessions, part traditional E Street, with touches of soul, R & B and even mariachi and rap popping up at various points on the record.<br /><br />However, the record's weakness lies in its most crucial factor: Bruce.  For all the effort put into getting the arrangements, sound and production bang-on, there is comparatively little effort put into the actual words of the songs. There are no lyrics on this record as moving, precise or detailed as, say, the last verse of \\"The River,\\" the opening of \\"Thunder Road,\\" or to use a more recent example, the last verse of \\"Long Walk Home.\\"  The lyrics range from being banal and simplistic (the clich&eacute; laden first single \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" and the list of chores that is \\"Jack of All Trades\\") to downright embarrassing (\\"Easy Money,\\" the novelty title song). The songs are impeccably dressed up with no place to go.<br /><br />There are some strong moments to be sure. \\"Shackled and Drawn\\" and \\"Death to My Hometown\\" are both powerful, Celtic tinged rave-ups, \\"You've Got It\\" is jarring thematically but is a nice roadhouse blues, and the sample laden \\"Rocky Ground\\" is a bit repetitive but works well, and even the rap towards the end (not by Bruce but by a female singer whose name escapes me at the moment) is surprisingly effective.  Best of the brand new ones is \\"We Are Alive,\\" a tribute to fallen souls lost to the strains of inequality and social repression loaded with energy and spirit.<br /><br />The album's best overall moment, somewhat unfortunately, is the thirteen year old \\"Land of Hope and Dreams,\\" debuted in 1999 on the E Street Band's Reunion Tour. The studio take of the song takes the passion of the live performances to a whole new level, and is also significant for featuring the final recorded appearance of Clarence Clemons, who passed away last June.<br /><br />The deluxe edition of the record comes with two bonus songs, a studio take on the Seeger Sessions gem \\"American Land\\" and Leonard Cohen / Tom Waits esque \\"Swallowed Up (In the Belly of a Whale).  \\"American Land\\" gets a heavier, less folksier E Street Band feel, and it works well, giving it a Dropkick Murphys vibe that it previously lacked.  \\"Swallowed Up\\" is a sparse, haunting acoustic number with apocalyptic undertones that stands as one of the most pleasantly unusual numbers in Bruce's ouvre.<br /><br />While \\"Wrecking Ball\\" has quite a few highlights and shows that The Boss is still willing to branch into different directions musically, it also sadly represents a decline in Bruce's abilities as a lyricist. Gone are the great stories and characters that listeners can close their eyes and envision. It's now simply buzz words and stock imagery that does not paint as nearly as compelling a picture.
B003BFTS9K|1.0|I have to start out with this statement... I love the Black Rapid products and have used them with all of my cameras, with complete confidence.  That was until Sunday March 5, 2012... loading up the car with daughter in hand, my 5DmkII with 50mm f/1.2L strapped with the RS5 my whole rig took a DUMP onto the driveway!!!! This seemingly well built ConnectR-2 worked it's self into two pieces. It didn't break it came APART into the rectangular piece and the clip. Apparently the material it's made of is malleable and with the use over the last year it has widened the hole that the pin goes through, allowing the pin head to cock itself in there sideways.  With the twisting it just happened to work itself out and there went about 4000$ onto the pavement.  I trusted that Black Rapid would build its components out of quality material, unfortunately that turned out to be unwise. Really disappointed!!!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This is one of the BEST books I have ever read. Stories for old and young, life lesson that wont be soon forgotten, and it will make you laugh and cry. It is everything a book should be... Heartwarming=)
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Very good, I recommend, I received the product before the promised deadline and I am totally satisfied. i found it almost usefull and i keep it the product
B00729GQ0A|5.0|First off, Rebecca Hamilton is an amazing writer. And an amazing lady!! I was up late as usual on Twitter and I follow her account, so I emailed her about a free copy. She was super nice and sent it to me, and that night and into the following evening I read the entire book. Even during class (which was bad of me, but it was too good for me to put down.) When I did put it down I couldn't help but want to finish reading because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Rebecca knows how to draw a reader in, suck them into the dimension of the book. I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Secondly, The Forever Girl has an amazing plot and amazing characters. Sophie is my favourite and someone I think I can relate to, in part. An outcast of society kinda, HAHA! And Charles.... yah, Charles *squees!!!!*... that's all I'll say, LOL. And I loved, LOVED how she had everything paranormal. Vampires, werewolves, Wiccans, scary things. My favourite things to read about!!!<br /><br />Thank you, Rebecca, for giving me the opportunity to read such an amazing, well-written book. I'm looking forward to more!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER, I LOVE IT. IT'S A GREAT BOOK FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT!
030745455X|5.0|This book is very good! Well written, interesting, and hard to put down. I highly recommend it!<br />However, I would say these books are not appropriate for younger audiences.  There is a lot of language and some sexual content that is not so much erotic as just downright disturbing.<br />Even with that it's a very good series!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Lifelong VH fan and completely objective in terms of albums/eras... fan of everything from Simmons demo tape to even VH3 (well, not much to love from that one, but Eddie was in a bad place at that time; Gary Cherone is a great vocalist though). I'm a fan of VH like I'm a fan of James Bond... i.e., find the positive in the unique characteristics of each period, if you will. If you're a rock/hard rock fan, and especially a VH fan, and don't love this album, you should probably go back to listening today's current Top 40 and stick with Bieber!<br /><br />I've read so-called music critics question and debate everything with the release of Different Kind of Truth (DKOT) such as the album's title, Eddie's sobriety/appearance, to Wolfie's playing and vocals compared to Michael Anthony, to Dave's vocal range and on-stage theatrics (or lack thereof), they used some old, original and unreleased music, there are too many tracks on the album (who complains about getting more for their money these days?!?), etc... etc... give me (and the band) a break already! At the end of the day, it's all petty. You don't listen to and/or attend the concert of an iconic rock band to see their dance moves or dress, or debate the \\"politics\\" of rock - you have a good time and get loud with one of the best ever. If this album had been released by a \\"new\\" band, instead of one coming back, people would probably be saying \\"Welcome the new kings of rock.\\" Instead, it's \\"Welcome back one of the kings of rock.\\"<br /><br />And DKOT delivers! I listened to this album multiple times, front to back, on a recent road trip and can honestly say there isn't a track on this album that doesn't kick tail. There is at least one moment on almost all of the tracks where you just replay it louder, and louder - and say \\"Man, that is just in your face right there.\\"<br /><br />DKOT puts you right back into the VH that simply rocks. I agree with many fans who have said DKOT could easily fit in the Fair Warning/Women and Children First era. BUT, the cool thing to me is that the album combines some elements of the past 35 years of VH with a whole bunch of new/unique elements that make it equally contemporary-sounding in many respects. The whole album is a musical paradox, from outside the box tracks like Bullethead and Honeybabysweetiedoll, to Big River, a re-written version of Big Trouble, a previously unreleased vintage VH track from the Simmons demo recording. Even though the whole song and solo closely mirror the original track they recorded decades ago, EVH's solo sounds as good or better than any other rock guitar contemporary alive. Eddie still uses lots of phaser and probably more wah than ever throughout many chorus and solos, plus some great new sounds/techniques here and there to mix things up. I always loved Alex's drums and felt he's been underrated because of his brother's acclaim; how about some credit for helping hold the band together and keeping the beat to one of the best guitarists ever? Wolfie is awesome too - he can even do back-up vocals and most people just bash him because he's not Eddie Van Halen or Michael Anthony, not because he can't play great bass guitar. And I think WVH's presence and influence definitely seem to have helped shake up things with the band's music. I had some doubts when Dave first resurfaced on/off again with VH, but he sounds great and he is such a creative lyricist. If you're just a casual VH fan, or don't really pay attention to the lyrics, you're missing some classic DLR poetry. Also, great editing and production of the album IMO with a variety of recording styles heard throughout the various tracks.<br /><br />And one final comment for all the VH vs. Chickenfoot debaters. I still like Hagar, Anthony, Satriani and Smith, individually and as a band. And maybe Sammy is right that individually, each member of CF is a technically superior musician in some respects. But a band is the sum of the whole and the final product speaks the truth; and in this case, DKOT is not only \\"different\\", it's a classic - period.h; and in this case, DKOT is not only \\"different\\", it's a classic - period.

0345528581|4.0|I think this is the best approach to take to physical strength training. That is, I think a pure body-building/weight lifting approach is unhealthy and uninteresting compared to this. I think Mark's workouts and his full programmes are terrific - and I'm sure, if you take advantage of his expertise, you will transform your physique. I think his approach to bodyweight exercises shows that you do not need free-weights and a gym to build a more muscular physique - and I'm also sure that I'll be using what is basically his approach for a very long time to come. So I'm really a very big fan. Having said that I think I injured myself quite badly when I first started to do these workouts - and I think he is not entirely blameless - a couple of months later, I'm still trying to recover. I believe the problem was the pull-me-ups done using a regular table. You lie underneath the table and, holding on to its edges, you pull yourself up with a straight back. I put a lot of energy into doing this - the problem was I could not get a good grip on the table. Trying to get one has messed up my elbow and forearm - giving me something like tennis elbow. This is really a very bad thing for someone as obsessed with training and exercising as I am. So I think, in Mark's enthusiasm to show that we need no specialized equipment to get into shape he has recommended that we do difficult exercises using truly awful equipment (e.g. regular tables) - and this is very likely to lead to injuries. I'm sure he wouldn't injure himself doing these things - he's young and in perfect shape - but for those of us over forty it is a recipe for quite serious injury. I recommend you get some good home gym equipment - like a power tower that allows you to do a range of bodyweight exercises safely - then follow his workouts and long programmes.
1612130283|1.0|I'm seriously worried about the people who rave about this book!  Christian Grey is a psycho stalker.  This isn't erotic, it's scary and usually winds up with one person dead and the other in jail.  This book is disturbing on so many levels.  Don't waste your money reading about  a woman who can't tell the difference between love and victimization.
1400095204|4.0|I gave this book four stars mainly because it helped me learn about a part of Nigerian history that was unfamiliar to me - the Nigeria-Biafra War of 1967-1970. As with all historical fiction, this book made me curious about the real history and people. The author had relatives who actually fought in the war and obviously did a lot of research, so I assume this novel is fairly accurate. The novel follows the lives of two well-off twin sisters Olanna and Kainene and their respecitve lovers (then husbands), Odenigbo and Richard. Odenigbo is an intellectual and math professor who eventualy marries Olanna, the \\"beautiful\\" twin. Richard is a white, British man who comes to Nigeria to study art (pots) and falls in love with Kainene, the self-described \\"ugly\\" twin. The story also details the life of Ugwu who comes to Odenigbo's household at about the age of 13 as a houseboy and eventually is forcibly conscripted to fight for Biafra.<br /><br />The author skillfully evokes the details (often mundane) of everyday life - the food, the conversations, the landscape. As the conflict between the North (Nigeria) and South (Biafra) develops, the book describes the painful deterioration of people's everyday routines, relationships, and well-being. The horrors of war are amply addressed, including rape, torture, bombings, injuries, death and starvation.<br /><br />I will not give away any of the details, but the story is not new at its core: relationships are complicated and war is horrific. Though long, the novel is an easy read. Despite its length, I felt that some of characters could have been developed more fully. I never did quite understand either the Richard/Kainene relationship or the Odendigbo/Olanna relationship. The descriptions of sharp, skinny Kainene and beautiful Olanna became repetitive. Nevertheless, the novel is impressive in its scope and detailed coverage of this brutal civil war in which a million people died.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 will easily go down as one of the best Stephen King novels ever. It's as good as, if not better than, Hearts in Atlantis, another favorite of mine. As soon as you'll read the first sentence, you'll know that this book is special. It's impossible to keep it down for the first 300-odd pages. It slows down for 200-odd pages then, but by the time you finish reading it, you'll have a big smile on your face.
0143039431|5.0|When absolute naked wild Capitalism rules and there is no Government intervention, it wreaks havoc in society and the weak and the poor are at the mercy of the rich and powerful, ordinary working people become instruments like animals, worthless cogs of a machine that at the same time grinds them, This seems to be the main idea behind this colossal novel<br />The story begins when Oklahoma farmers are forced to leave their land, and head west to California  because they are replaced by tractors, as the actual owners of the land, the ruthless Banks, understand that hand labor does not yield a profit. One of these families is the Joads (the collective character of this tale), which \\"in group\\" confront the continuous adversity \\"individualism\\" is offering them every step of the way from the moment they leave Oklahoma until they finally try to settle down in California where they had gone following the indications of a handbill requesting orange pickers and just one unique hope, to find work, but in California things does not seem to be the way it looked, and the battle renews and rages on. Contemporary issues arise, such as immigration, equality, unemployment, egotism, hunger, strikes, law, authority, social demands. The ending leaves a message of hope, related to the will each individual possess in its more intimate and spiritual values.  Almost a classic, this novel has been classified among the best written in the 20th century by book critics

B0052U59F4|2.0|Where do I start? I suppose this book could be hot...if you're a tween. I don't really feel any which way about the leading man. At 27 he's young but the role is believeable. Forgiveable at least. Perhaps it's because I'm slightly older than the characters that I don't really find reading about this 21 yr old who's never so much as once had any kind of sexual feelings for anyone before Mr. Grey came along more than just a little corny to endure. There can't be more than 2 paragraphs without the mention of blushing, flushing, \\"down there\\", looking through lashes, and the most annoying statement of all....oh my. Oh my? Give me a break. Reading about Christian this, oh my, and Christian that, oh my...I'm blushing, in every single chapter leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />I honestly don't know which is worse...that I paid to read this highly rated book...or that these bland scenes are a step up from a mundane, real life sex life for many. Now that's depressing. I've had steamier conversations with my girlfriends.

For an +800 pages novel, I never thought, while reading it, that any part of the novel was unnecessary.<br /><br />It gave you an interesting view of this tragic event that took place on November 22, 1963 and at the same time you got so invested in the main character and everyone that he interacted with.<br /><br />I higly recommend everyone to read this novel and I would love it, if this would ever come out as a movie since I would love to see these characters come to live on the big screen.

0307346617|5.0|I am in love with Max Brooks' writing and can't wait for his next book, zombie-related or not! World War Z is the perfect analogy for the ills of today's society. Brooks takes a ridiculous premise (world over-run by zombies), and turns it into something that is not only believable, but inevitable. I am also in awe of how he can create so many different voices and stories and thread them together. Even if you're not a zombie fan, give this a shot - it will certainly make you think twice about the manifest destiny of humanity
B005LAIGLE|3.0|\\"Contraband\\" is a 2011 action film starring Mark Wahlberg as a former smuggler reluctantly drawn back into the game for one last score, this time to help his brother-in-law (Caleb Landry Jones) who got in too deep with the bad guys (Giovanni Ribisi).<br /><br />For the past few years Wahlberg has been cranking out the action films at a pace that truly amazes. He's been nominated twice for an Oscar (\\"The Fighter\\" in 2010 and \\"The Departed\\" in 2006) and recognized for \\"Three Kings\\" (1999), and \\"Four Brothers\\" (2005), although my favorite Wahlberg role (and guilty pleasure) \\"Shooter\\" (2007) has been ignored on the awards circuit.<br /><br />If his awards were not sufficient praise, Wahlberg has delivered at the box office. Seven of his films have neared or topped the elusive $100 Million mark, and most of his films have been among the top 10.<br /><br />And if awards and box office clout aren't enough, Wahlberg has a second career as a producer, a role he served on this film and on Oscar nominated \\"The Fighter\\" (2010) as well as several TV series (\\"Broadwalk Empire\\", \\"Entourage\\").<br /><br />Unfortunately, Wahlberg is about the best thing in this film, apart from some good action scenes with lots of explosions and a coy performance from J. K. Simmons who apparently got time off from his role as the Police Chief in \\"The Closer\\".<br /><br />Perhaps the problem is with the writers (Aaron Guzikowski, Arnaldur Indrioason, Oskar Jonasson) and director (Baltasar Kormakur), none of whom have much experience with American style action films. But they worked on an Icelandic thriller \\"Reykjavik-Rotterdam\\" (2008) and that film was the basis of this one. Or, more likely, the problem is that the villain, Giovanni Ribisi, simply carries no menace. Ribisi is a very talented actor (\\"Boiler Room\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"The Rum Diary\\"), but he's out of his depth in this genre.<br /><br />Reviews were unanimously poor. Roger Ebert referred to the film as \\"crap\\" and said he was getting tired of violent retreads\\".  Peter Travers (Rolling Stone) gave it 2 stars and complained that Wahlberg sleepwalks through the film. The NY Times called the story absurd and referred to the film as \\"thrill free\\".<br /><br />Despite the poor reviews, \\"Contraband\\" earned more than $20 Million in its opening weekend and is on schedule to  hit the $100 Million mark.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you're a Mark Wahlberg fan you'll enjoy this one, but it is clearly one of his lesser accomplishments.ired of violent retreads\\".

0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a slow burner that will take you a while to get into, but the stories will stay with you long after you've turned the final page. I've read some of the negative reviews on here where people think it's pretentious twaddle, but I've waded through screeds of inane stuff in the course of my job - and this definitely isn't pretentious.<br /><br />In Cloud Atlas, David Mitchell has given us a wonderful, vast, richly imagined world to play in. I got frustrated a couple of times in the beginning, because I'd find that just as I got into one story, it would suddenly skip ahead to the next one. But as I got further into the novel, I actually began to enjoy this sequence. I found that by telling six separate but interlocking stories in such an unconventional way, the book actually made me think and engage a bit more.<br /><br />The characters were also all so hugely compelling that I really cared, and wanted to find out about what happened to them in the end. In particular, the character of Sonmi~451 and her story about the futuristic society of Neo so Copros will haunt your dreams.<br /><br />I'm nervous about the film version that's being released this year. But I'd be happy if it's only half as good as the novel!

I don't like that all three books beat and beat and beat Katniss down until she couldn't even appreciate having a child fully.  Unbelievable to take the main character, the one who started out with the intention of protecting the ones she loves, and turn her strip her bare.  Make he crazy, suck the spirit of life from her, just down right suicidal and pathetic.  Books are supposed to give me something to hold onto when I'm finished reading them.  All this book gave me to hold onto was that perhaps the dull existence that most of us are living is the best it's gonna get and I should just accept that.  Way to go Collins.  You've inspired us all to accept our realities rather than reach out and attempt some sort of greatness.<br /><br />I'm pissed.  I wish I would have never read the last book.

145162445X|4.0|This book is a very engaging and highly enlightening introduction to modern cosmology, with forays into quantum mechanics and general relativity thrown in. Indeed, I have never seen better. Krauss's ploy to get you to read this book is to add some half-baked theology/metaphysics that will draw in those interested in the debate as to whether science can replace faith in interpreting our world. Krauss's argument is that modern cosmology shows that we have a universe without the need for positing a Creator. He is not at all convincing (which no doubt motivates most of his one-star detractors in the Amazon reviews of this book).<br /><br />The story starts with the discovery that Cepheid variable stars exhibited a regular relationship between brightness and period of variation. In 1913, the distance to a known Cepheid was accurately measured, making it possible to use the brightness of a Cepheid in any part of the visible universe to measure its distance. Hubble used this fact to show that there were galaxies outside our own, and that the universe is expanding.<br /><br />Another advance allowing us to measure distances in the universe was the fact that Type 1a supernovas, which occur only once per hundred years per universe, have a tight relationship between brightness and the length of time they shine before winking out. We can measure the time, and then infer the distance to the galaxy containing the supernova. Because there a billions of galaxies, Type 1a supernova are actually quite common in the night sky.<br /><br />By observing the spectral lines from stars, astronomers long ago determined that stars and intranebular gasses are made from the same stuff as the physical matter on Earth. Indeed, helium was first discovered from analyzing starlight, and only afterwards discovered on Earth. Because we know what the matter in the universe is made of, we can estimate the composition of the matter in the universe. If we know how much matter there is, we can use simple physics to determine how stars should attract one another, and hence determine the speed of various stars and even galaxies. When this was done, it was found that stars far from the center of our galaxies are moving much faster than predicted by the known mass of the stars in the universe. This is the origin of \\"dark matter.\\"<br /><br />What is dark matter made of? If we measure the initial density of protons and neutrons arising from the Big Bang (there was too much energy for the first 300,000 years of the universe to support anything but a plasma of neutrons and protons), which we can do by measuring the current abundance of very light atoms (hydrogen, helium, lithium), which were the first atoms to appear after the universe cooled a bit, we find that the we are missing about half of the matter that we should see. The other half presumably is part of the \\"dark matter.\\" However this accounts for only about 20% of what the amount of dark matter must be. What is the rest? No one knows.<br /><br />The amount of dark matter is important because this amount determines whether our universe is open, closed or flat. However, we don't know how much dark matter there is. So Krauss takes another tack. The light from a star shows us what the star was like at the time the light was emitted from the star. If we look at very far-away stars, we can peer far into the universe's past. However, before age 300,000 years, the universe' matter was a hadron plasma that absorbed all photons, so it is impossible to peer back farther than that. However, the 300,000 year surface of the universe is \\"last scattering surface,\\" and by measuring the density of matter on this surface, we can tell whether the universe is open, closed, or flat. Why? Because gravitational clumping is subject to the laws of gravity, and gravitational forces move at the speed of light. Therefore, we can determine the actual maximum width of a clump, as measured on the last scattering surface. If the universe is flat, we will observe exactly what we calculated. If the universe is open, light rays will \\"fan out\\" from the last scattering surface, so clumps will look bigger. Similarly, if the universe is close, lumps will look smaller. What we observe is compatible only with a flat universe. Krauss's exposition here is just superb.<br /><br />Given that the universe is flat, we can calculate that 70% of the energy is missing, being neither visible matter nor dark matter. This is essentially Einstein's \\"cosmological constant,\\" although astronomers move this from the right side of the equation (curvature) to the left (energy). Krauss argues that this \\"dark energy\\" is actually the energy of empty space (this is the \\"nothing\\" in the title of the book).<br /><br />Krauss here takes a long and beautiful detour into quantum mechanics explaining how the uncertainty principle predicts that empty space is really a frothing turmoil of particle coming into and out of existence, and reality of virtual particles is proved by their use in predicting the spectral lines of hydrogen with an accuracy of one part in 100 billion.<br /><br />If we calculate the energy in empty space, we get a figure that is 120 orders of magnitude larger than all the energy in the universe. So this calculation is wrong, but no one knows why. Krauss calls this the Cosmological Constant Problem. He makes a rather lame argument that the energy of empty space must be zero after the frothiness cancels out (although perhaps it does). Cryptically, a few pages later, he asserts that the missing energy must be not in the form of any matter but empty space (p. 75), so I will disregard his lame argument.<br /><br />Krauss explains why the universe is flat using Guth's inflation theory, which says that very early in its existence, the universe underwent a phase transition that led it to increase a trillion-fold in size in almost time (space can expand faster than the speed of light, although nothing in a give space can travel faster than the speed of light). Whatever small amounts of curvature were present at the inflation point would be obliterated by the inflation process.

We do not know anything about the realms of being of the Creator or Creators, but we believe they must exist beyond the limits of our understanding. Our reason for believing this is that we experience possessing forms of knowledge inaccessible to other species (amoebae, mushrooms,field mice, Capuchin monkeys, German Shepards, chimpanzees, and such).

I received this a gift and I tried several times to get it to work. I hope that this is simply an issue with digital copies being new, however I'm very disappointed :(
B00679T1EO|5.0|If picture quality is important to you this format detail is important to know. I am assuming that Series 2 will be the same but I have not bought that yet but will. If there is a difference I will update:<br />Update: 9/4/12 Series 2 is the same 1080p as series 1 and is wonderful in both colors and sound. It does not have the Xmas special on it.<br /><br />I bought the PBS version Series 1 (Blu-ray)first and UK version (import) Series 1 (Blu-ray) (region free so it does play in the US). I bought the PBS Blu-ray first thinking they were equal in format. Not so. The PBS version is 1080i and the UK version is 1080p. If you have a good setup and really enjoy this aspect of things there is no comparison. The 1080p version is a lot better in both picture and sound. The PBS is much more grainy throughout. With the UK 1080p there are some problems here and there with grain in the shadows at times and colors a bit over done (on my setup)here and there but the 1080p version really knocked me over. It does matter what setup you have but basically I found the PBS version much grainier and the sound just wasn't quite as crisp. Would some not care? I'm sure but I love the detail in the accents so this turned out to be important for me and you could hear more in the UK 1080p version. For me, it was like meeting the crew all over again. The UK 1080p version also has deleted scenes which are not the end all but are fun to have. Again, I am assuming that most wouldn't care so much about this but I thought I'd bring it up. Side by side you can't help but notice this difference.<br />  For series 2 the big negative for me though is that the 1080p version (import) does not have the Christmas Special on it. So..........you will pay a heck of a lot more since you will have to buy that separate and it looks like at a high price (at this time). Never easy with this thing I guess. Since the import is so much better for my intentions (not an addiction for the next episode) I will buy the UK1080p w/o the special and by the time I get there the separate Xmas special will probably be down in price.<br />  I'm trying not to get too complicated here but if you are confused about which is which here the UK 1080p Blu-ray version says \\"import\\" in the title description on Amazon and has a number 12 in the lower right corner of the front picture....and to be sure .........I am talking about the Blu-ray versions and not the standard DVD. I am trying to detail things here since there is so much confusion in specific language about these things.<br />Note: Another comparison: If you have seen this on Netflix the PBS 1080i version is FAR superior to that. In the end if you want a copy of this and are not too fussy about things the less costly version PBS 1080i Blu-ray version is fine. Since I have not seen it on TV (PBS) I can not make that comparison.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|According to one critic, the slang phrase I've used for my review title has been 'out of style' for many eons. I'd never heard of it, which must mean two things: 1) I'm not hip, and 2) I ain't worried about it. Lana del Rey, who uses the phrase in her song 'Blue Jeans,' doesn't seem to be worried, either.<br /><br />While husky altos, hip-hop beats, and '60s melodic stylings have been done before, I've never heard them meshed together, let alone so perfectly, a true feat of acculturation that is exciting and revelatory. Her music is interesting, and layered, and each layer is interesting; and that's the difference between albums you listen to every now and again and albums you listen to all the way through twice a day.<br /><br />What I want first and foremost from the music I listen to is a great melody. And I have to say, Lana del Rey's album has that in spades. The melodies are just magnificently beautiful, and while that might seem like an overstatement, I'm okay with it. I've heard plenty of gorgeous music in my lifetime because that's what I gravitate to, and I know this is the goods right here. I find it pretty much ingenious that her songs are backed by some hardcore beats, and on top of that, the kind of lush instrumentation you might expect from a cinematic score.<br /><br />While apparently that golden alto is not exactly her natural register, she uses it to gorgeous effect, most notably in 'Video Games' but also in the sublime opening verses of songs like 'Born to Die,' 'Summertime Sadness,' and 'Radio.' I really, really love it. Which is perhaps why I have a hard time accepting her upper-register turns, for example in 'Off to the Races.' But in other places, like 'This Is What Makes Us Girls' and 'The Lucky Ones,' it's easier to digest, as she sings outright rather than creating an affect. For me, the jury's still deliberating - is her persona solidified, or is she still experimenting?<br /><br />The only songs that I have to mostly tolerate are 'Off to the Races' and 'National Anthem' - ironically the two  that lay reviewers on several sites regularly cite as favorites. I know that she's not trying to come off literally as a rapper, just someone who appreciates the genre, but for my personal tastes I'd rather her keep it to a minimum. And I think she uses rhythmic phrasing to great effect elsewhere; it's lower-dosage and easier to swallow.<br /><br />I believe this album is a major accomplishment, for the reasons I've listed above and in spite of what I perceive to be shortcomings. I would recommend getting the deluxe version, because the three additional songs are amazing. I love the harmonies in 'Without You'; 'Lolita' is the most aggressively hip-hop of the album, with (Asian) Indian overtones and flashes of pseudo-reggaeton. 'The Lucky Ones' is preciously grandiose and ends with another beautiful string-section meditation.<br /><br />My favorite song should be 'Born to Die,' but it's actually 'Radio.' As mentioned above, the opening gives me chills; and the chorus just rolls along so effortlessly, easy rhythms married to a flirty melody; the beat is, as usual, top-notch. Yeah, she drops the F-bomb, but it's not in-your-face, and I really don't think she meant it to be startling. It rolls along with everything else, just a part of the tapestry. Listening to the lyrics, I wonder if they're not subtly aimed at her audience? \\"Their heavy words can't bring me down\\" from the first verse; and the second verse: \\"American dreams came true somehow/I swore I'd chase until I was dead/I heard the streets were paved with gold/That's what my father said.\\" Mmmmm-hmm. And ending, of course, with \\"How do you like me now?\\"<br /><br />I'm saddened by the professional music critics who, very obviously, knew what they were going to say about del Rey's music before the album even dropped and stuck to their guns even after listening - if they even gave it the thorough listen each musician deserves. How anyone who gets paid to placea value on music can truly absorb the vast majority of these songs and not come away with an appreciation of the constantly superior melodies, sublime but never over-powering beats, and moments of lyric beauty, I will never understand.<br /><br />This is the only album that has pulled F+TM's 'Ceremonials' out of heavy rotation in my stereo and car. Five stars, and keep up the good work, Ms. Grant.a value on music can truly absorb the vast majority of these songs and not come away with an appreciation of the constantly superior melodies, sublime but never over-powering beats, and moments of lyric beauty, I will never understand.<br /><br />This is the only album that has pulled F+TM's 'Ceremonials' out of heavy rotation in my stereo and car.

B0064MT1U8|5.0|When it comes to movies like this I've found either you love them or hate them. My wife loves this movie even if the the story line is less than factual- far fetched even - but it's one of those 'feel good' films that grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. Terrific performances and a rich story line create an atmosphere of lightheartedness that keeps even the most crusty soul entertained.<br /><br />  The way I look at it, 'Patton' or the 'Matrix' or anything by the 'Duke' ( that's John Wayne to us 'pilgrims' in-the-know ) might appeal more to my sensibilities but if the wife states she wants to watch a romantic movie for a change, well, this one is made to order.<br /><br />  The movie is very well made with rich production values, the BluRay sound and visuals are top notch and Gwyneth Paltrow is especially easy on the eyes in her period costumes. Overall 'Shakespeare In Love' is a winner. Keeping the peace and making the 'better half' a happy ( and romantic ) viewer has never been so easy.<br /><br />  Just plan on making your own popcorn.

0545403359|3.0|But I couldn't get past a couple chapters. The writing was sporadic and jumped back and forth. I love the idea of telling a story through the horse's point of view though. I guess I'll just watch it in theaters and give this book to the kids.
B003O86FMW|4.0|In the first book of this series I got sucked in with the rest of Panem in the tragic love story of Katniss and Peeta, but by the third book, Mockingjay you find that this series truly is not a love story.  It is about the horrors of war and the corruptness of politics. The first book will have you on edge after every sentence, the second book will break your heart, but the third book will devastate you. If you continue on after the Hunger Games to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay because you want to see more of the love story with Katniss and Peeta you will be sadly disappointed. They have enough sweet moments to keep you going, but not enough for me to feel resolved about their turmoil at the end.<br /><br />All three books in the Hunger Games are extraordinary and entirely worth reading, the characters are real and deep and well developed; but be warned the love story between Katniss and Peeta, as well as the love triangle including Gale is not what this book is about, and maybe that's the point. Like the rest of the selfish, corrupted and twisted people in the capital I'm so sucked into their love story in the Hunger Games that I overlook the senseless death that surrounds them, and I think that says something. But their relationship is something that I wish the author had given us more of. Instead the sweet moments where Katniss gets a brief moment to share with Peeta or Gale are somewhat rushed past or skipped over.<br /><br />I would still suggest reading all three books, but I wish I had known more to expect when I got into them because they left me utterly devastated. Don't start Catching Fire if you need a happy ending, because you can't read Catching Fire and not read Mockingjay; and Mockingjay will leave you wanting a little in the end.<br /><br />Check out my review of Mockingjay for more info.
006197806X|4.0|It's safe to say that Delirium was on the top of everyone's must read list last year. It was an epic, sprawling dystopian that took the YA world by storm, and Pandemonium is a book that is going to be just as huge this year. It goes without saying that Lauren Oliver is a writing phenomena, and anything she pens is breath taking and worth reading.<br /><br />Getting back into Lena's world was a relief. Delirium left things way too open-ended, and I was dying to know what had happened to her. The first few pages are heart-pounding as you escape with Lena. Her jumbled, broken thoughts are mesmerizing. I love how quickly I was drawn back into this story.<br /><br />While I absolutely adore Oliver's writing and the way she tells a tale, I felt like this story was a bit frustrating. Let me explain: While the action and drama were undoubtedly present, this book did what so many other books and even TV shows do in their sophomore chapters. They introduced new characters, and inevitably when new characters are introduced and given their own arcs, other main characters you initially fell in love with are pushed to the side. I will say that by the end, I came to enjoy most of these new characters, but I found it a bit off-putting in the beginning.<br /><br />I also wasn't entirely crazy about the flip flopping from Then and Now. The story alternates chapters, dividing the novel into past and present, which took a bit of getting used to. I was used to it by the end, but never entirely comfortable with it. I felt the story lost some of its fluidity. I would have preferred a more linear story, but that's my personal preference.<br /><br />The ending positively killed me. Oliver has also mastered the jaw-dropping, cliff hanger ending, so be warned. If Delirium left you craving more, Pandemonium will leave you pulling your hair out in frustration. I personally can't wait to see what the next installment in this story brings, and how Oliver ties everything together. I'm sure it will be epic.be epic.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|These books sucked me in and went straight to my heart, I felt for Katniss dearly and was engrossed in her struggles; however this book left me shattered.<br /><br />I suppose what left me a little disappointed with the end of Mockingjay was that by the end of it all, after watching Katniss survive the Hunger Games which in themselves are twisted, then get sent back in; after watching her give up everything for her family for her sister, after watching her loose it all to win the war; Katniss is left destroyed. She is a shell of her former self. Her friendships are broken, her home destroyed, so many people dead. Katniss, a girl who from the very beginning has this amazing will to survive and an enormous heart is so broken by the end that she wants to die and her heart is shattered.<br /><br />She's devastatingly broken and we hear about everything that brings her down in great detail; but her path to recovery is practically glossed over. I wanted to see more of Katniss's return to even the ghost of her former self that she seems to be left with by the epilogue, but instead I'm simply told that eventually she gets a little better and (SPOILER) that she and Peeta eventually end up finding themselves able to care about each other again.<br /><br />I didn't want a happy ending and understanding what the book is really about I understand why it ends the way it does, and honestly it ends perfectly except that I wanted to see it; I wanted more details of Katniss, the girl who was on fire. The girl who is burned to ash and then things get a little better, not a phoenix rising, but a flicker of hope, just a little something that everything she'd been through was worth something to her; but we don't get to see it. We get graphic details about all the things that suck the life from her but barely any about what little spark remains. If I could have had just a little more romance there at the end, just been able to see that connection between Katniss and Peeta returned to them this book would have been perfect, but in my opinion it is lacking that.<br /><br />I would still suggest reading all three books because seeing Katniss change and become this power that truly does the right thing is moving and I cheered and cried for her along the way; but I wish I had known more to expect when I got into them because they left me utterly devastated.this book would have been perfect, but in my opinion it is lacking that.<br /><br />I would still suggest reading all three books because seeing Katniss change and become this power that truly does the right thing is moving and I cheered and cried for her along the way; but I wish I had known more to expect when I got into them because they left me utterly devastated.

1451673442|4.0|In The Secret, Rhonda Byrne introduced the reader to the concept of The Law of Attraction. In her latest book, The Magic, she focuses on how gratitude can change our lives; that we will attract all we want when we practice feeling gratitude.<br /><br />The book begins with a reminder of how we felt magic in life as children; how as adults, we want to be around kids just to feel that magic again. She then explains how we can feel that magic again as adults...<br /><br />In the Gospel of Matthew in the Holy Scriptures, written over 2000 years ago, there is a cryptic message that has caused confusion...the crux of it is that \\"whoever has gratitude will be given more and he or she will have abundance.\\"<br /><br />As in The Law of Attraction, \\"like attracts like.\\" So, if you are grateful for what's in your life, the law of attraction will attract more of that into your life.<br /><br />Byrne writes that all the major religions have gratitude at their core...So The Magic is having gratitude in your life.<br /><br />Having gratitude takes practice, according to Byrne. She advises the reader to practice saying \\"thank you\\" and meaning it...that saying a heartfelt thank you will change your life:<br />  Say thank you deliberately and with meaning<br />  The more you say thank you, the more you feel gratitude<br />  The more gratitude you give out, the more abundance you will receive<br /><br />The Magic is uplifting to read. Will it really completely change your life? It depends...working real gratitude into your life is a good thing. How much it'll change your world depends...I would add that I have a spiritual, not religious background, and gratitude is also central to spirituality. It just makes sense.<br /><br />As a Feng Shui interior designer who also practices the law of attraction, I would like to suggest some ways to help you be reminded to feel gratitude every day: surround yourself with things in your home that make you feel good and feel grateful to own...keep your home free from clutter, as clutter causes confusion and a muddled mind; place objects with the intent that they will help you attract what you desire. A book I recommend to all my clients that will help you do all of this is HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT:BEAUTIFY, DETOXIFY & ENERGIZE YOUR LIFE, YOUR HOME & YOUR PLANET. Trust me; it'll help you attract abundance in your life.<br /><br />Liked and recommend THE MAGIC....and THE SECRET if you haven't already read it.r home free from clutter, as clutter causes confusion and a muddled mind; place objects with the intent that they will help you attract what you desire.

B003Y5H51K|4.0|I picked up this movie from the local library to watch with my wife. My wife couldn't manage to sit through the entire movie, though! She found it a bit too intense in the suspense department. She got up once and said \\"I need to go empty the dishwasher! I can't watch this!\\" Then she got up again, later, and said \\"I need to fold some laundry! Tell me when they get out of this!\\" In total, there were three times she had to leave the room because she couldn't take the suspense. I was lying on the couch, watching her, at one point, and when I saw how big her eyes were, I just started laughing out loud. She turned to me and asked what I was laughing about, and when I told her the reason, she just said \\"Why are you making me watch this crazy movie?! you know I can't take movie like this!\\" It was hysterical!<br /><br />Seriously, though, if you want to watch a movie with plenty of action, suspense, beautiful wonders of nature, and great filming of it all, this is a good movie for you! Very solid movie!

B0059XTUB8|3.0|Aside from the protagonist and Marilyn, I don't think the acting in the film justified the reviews it received. Yes, Marilyn Monroe was a big deal and yes Michelle Williams did her justice. The film was far from what I would call a romping effort. A charming, flirty 23 year old British guy falls in love with the 30 year old Marilyn who's had three divorces and dwindling faith in her own personality. There is some dialogue about how Marilyn felt that everyone leaves her once they get to know her.  To sum up I'd like to say, this will serve as a perfect Home Box Office film for several decades to come. Also I must add that an actor who was nominated for oscar - Kenneth Branagh didn't act that well at all. Especially in the climax of the film.
B0059XTUEK|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Marilyn Monroe is best known as the quintessential American female sex symbol. After watching My Week With Marilyn I came away feeling sorry for both her, and the man who spent the week with her, aspiring filmmaker Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne).<br />According to the movie she never knew her father. Instead she kept a photo of Abraham Lincoln by her bed, the logic being \\"it might as well be him.\\" Her mother didn't want to care for her, so she was placed with foster parents.<br />By the time we're into My Week With Marilyn she's been married three times, and divorced twice.<br />Marilyn, at the time, was married to Arthur Miller (the author of To Kill a Mockingbird). She is to be learning her lines for The Prince and The Showgirl. Arthur is there, partially to support his new bride, but mainly to work on his next novel. Marilyn is needy, usually distraught about something and an early victim of taking pills to get up, pills to go to sleep, and what ever else. Arthur can't concentrate so leaves.<br />That's when Colin moves in -- he's young, never been in a relationship and infatuated with Marilyn.<br />Laurence Olivier recognizes this and tells young Colin, \\"Remember boy, when it comes to women, you're never too old for humiliation.\\" But it's to no avail - he's lovestruck.<br />Marilyn locks herself in her bedroom. Her co-stars become worried and frustrated because she is holding up production. The only person she'll talk to is Colin, who is more then ready to put up with anything just to be next to her.

B002IFT1ZA|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Game of Thrones is set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. It borrows from Roman, Greek, Viking and Assyrian cultures.

The boy lives but loses the loss of his legs and can't remember what happened. That's good for Jamie and Cersei Lannister, brother and sister, who are having an incestuous affair (to keep the bloodline pure) and who the boy saw. Cersei is married to King Robert Baratheon, an old friend and ally of Eddard's.<br />The King has asked Eddard to help watch over the throne fearing he has enemies from within. That's possible with Grand Maester Pycelle, who acts decrepid, but is more spry than he lets on, Varys, an enoch, and Lord Petyr Baelish, who has some hidden agendas of his own, are his closest advisors.

B0012DT9VK|1.0|I watched this because I thought it might be an updated, high-tech Charlie & the Chocolate Factory with 21st century effects that my 3 and 5-year old boys would enjoy. But it's too wack. It's too grown up. It's too Depp! The movie I'm going to show my kids, at least until they're older, is the one that makes more sense, no matter what age you are. The \\"nicer\\", easier-to-understand one with Gene Wilder and real little people.<br /><br />And that's my biggest gripe: how do you recreate a musical piece with dance and song using duplicates of a single face and a bunch of synthesized voices with images that look like they were cheaply spliced into other images to make the little dude look little? You don't, because even a 5-yr old is able to recognize the poor quality. The Oompa-Loompa in this version sucks! So does the chocolate river.

The books are quality paperback and after thumbing through them slowly they all appear to be printed and bound perfectly for a paperback.  I read these books before on the computer but wanted a complete set to reread on the go.  These are perfect.<br /><br />These are a great read and are well written.  I love the story and the characters.

Any complaints about the &quot;controls&quot; may require some calibration on your device? Also gives the option of a solo game which is nice. :) have fun.
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|This album includes simply everything: The classic E-Street rock, Bruce's singer-songwriter-qualities as well as Seeger-Sessions moments! For me it is one of the best Springsteen albums ever! Okay, the old albums from \\"Greetings\\" (1973) up to \\"Born in the USA\\" are lyrically and musically unequalled. BUT, compared to \\"Lucky town\\", \\"Human touch\\", \\"Working on a dream\\" the new album deserves 5 stars! I can understand those Springsteen fans who are constantly dwelling in the 70s and 80s and can agree on \\"The Rising\\", but still, \\"Wrecking ball\\" is not a one or two star album. These harsh reactions must have something to do with the criticism Springsteen stresses about the American society and its recent economic developments. Films such as \\"The Life of David Gale\\" or Bruce's \\"Nebraska\\" prove that social criticism is not arrangeable for the broad masses. I do not want to judge on American patriotism, as I haven't been born there, but loving ones country and criticising it at the same time, is not a contradiction to me (as a European).

006197806X|1.0|One of the other 1-star reviews already gave away the ending.  I'll avoid that, but I will say that the ending is what made this a one-star rather than a three-star review for me.<br /><br />There is very little that is believable in this book, but I am willing to suspend my disbelief for these YA dystopian novels.  I know they cater to a certain audience.  There is a ton of action, lots of twists and turns (many of them predictable), the love scenes were really well done.<br /><br />But why the ending?  After Delirium, I was upset at the ending because it moved me.  It was a great love story.  I thought it was brave of the author to leave Delirium's ending the way it was.  This ending- just a ploy to appease the YA girl set.  Implausible, poorly staged- even the only sentence spoken doesn't make sense coming from that character.<br /><br />Like some of the other reviewers, I didn't really connect with any of the new characters introduced in this book other than Julian.  I did like how Lena developed.<br /><br />But really, the ending spoiled the whole book for me.  YA dystopian trilogy writers- start taking some risks, please.  I'm tired of the same-old same-old. I just hope Divergent's sequel doesn't fall into the same trap.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it. With a title like \\"Drive,\\" it is easy to expect a film that is simply car chase after car chase, intermixed with gratuitous violence and a few sex scenes. I'm not going to act as if I don't watch those movies, too (because I do), and that is precisely why Drive was such an unexpected surprise.<br />The film is subtle but powerful. In fact, the things that are left out of this film (long blocks of dialogue that hammer the viewer with what is happening in case they are too dumb to get it; sex scenes featuring body model stand-ins; a happy, predictable, neatly tied-up ending) is part of what makes it great. Just the gazes between Gosling and Mulligan say more than sappy scenes ever could. The cinematography is excellent. A darkness runs through the movie and appears in the images but also in the characters. The music intermixes really well--I even ended up buying the soundtrack to this movie, which I pretty much never do.<br />I watched this film several times, and the more I thought about it (another great thing about this movie--it's one that can make you reflect), I started to consider the different meanings of the word \\"Drive.\\" Yes, the protagonist is a driver. He drives. But perhaps the real meaning as it applies to the movie is, \\"to send, expel, or otherwise move by force or compulsion.\\" So in this way, \\"The Driver\\" doesn't just drive the car, he forces the action, he is what makes what happens in the movie happen.<br />This has become my favorite film and made me rethink the capabilities of Gosling as an actor. He is gifted. Truly. This is the kind of film that other action films might have been, if they had any brains. Those movies are great for people without brains (just read the poor reviews of this film). But if you have a brain, and appreciate art and action (in the truest sense), give this film a try. It's a masterpiece.

0399536108|4.0|When I first got this book, I took one look at it and decided I wouldn't read it. After all, the guy writes for the Huffington Post, which, isn't much better than a tabloid magazine. Liks as not, there's definitely an issue of credibility here. I figured it would probably be that \\"la la la save the whales hug the trees\\" kind of stuff. I'm glad to say I was wrong.<br /><br />I changed my mind about reading this book though because I found the topic just too intriguing. Unlike a lot of people who believe that the way to change the world is to change outside circumstances, I believe that the way to change the world is to change yourself and become the best person you can possibly be. The first step is in actually believing there's room for improvement, and believe me, there's room for improvement in everyone.<br /><br />So I read this book, and I'm glad I did. This is far more than the adventures, or a travelogue of someone who writes for questionable journalistic entities. This is a roadmap for achieving more of what you want in life and finding a way to finance those dreams no matter what they are.<br /><br />If you are someone who wants to visit far off places like Africa, and feed the hungry, this book will appeal to you. If you're someone like me, who is more interested in seeing just how far you can go in life and what you can really do with your talents and aspirations, then this book is for you too.<br /><br />First, it's filled with some of the stories of how the author has chosen to fulfill his dreams. This includes everything from doing volunteer work overseas and living in a foreign country, to those other dreams like seeing all of the countries of the world.<br /><br />This is also about challenging the status quo and figuring out what is right for you in your life. Guillebeau also provides examples of people that he's worked with, as well as their outcomes. In the end, he really challenges you to think. The goal here is to find the path that is right for you, not the path your parents think you should take, or even the path the government or society thinks you should take.<br /><br />Ultimately, this does turn out to be a book about being a non conformist, about getting your life off of autopilot, about thinking about what you want to do, what you want to have, and who you want to be. The sad truth is that most people will never live the lives or their dreams because they will never take the risk. It is unfortunate, but this book might just help you avoid a life of \\"quiet desperation\\" if you are willing to apply the principles offered.<br /><br />In the end, what this book really shows you is that you don't have to be rich, or have huge amounts of resources to do those things you really want to do with your life. You just have to want it bad enough and then be courageous enough to take those steps you need to take to achieve it. This is a great book, and it's a fun book because not only do you get to read a book that's enjoyable, but it's engaging, interesting, and again, just plain fun too. You learn something. Definitely worth your time.you, not the path your parents think you should take, or even the path the government or society thinks you should take.<br /><br />Ultimately, this does turn out to be a book about being a non conformist, about getting your life off of autopilot, about thinking about what you want to do, what you want to have, and who you want to be.

B006PTL1QM|1.0|Film makers, like novelists, have artistic license when dealing with historical characters and events.  Still, when their portrayal is severely distorted, they may be doing a disservice to the audience, who comes to accept what they see or read as the truth.  This is the case with A Dangerous Method, which has so many biographical facts wrong that it makes the film hard to follow or understand. The movie purports to be about the relationship between Carl Jung at the beginning of his career, Freud, and one of Jung's first psychoanalytic patients, a young Russian-Jewish woman named Sabina Spielrein.  What is wrong? Jung is portrayed as a clean-cut, serious and soft-spoken young man.  In fact, the real Jung was a ferociously ambitious doctor, with a booming voice, energetic, and someone who felt, from late childhood on, that he had two personalities.  He was, in other words, somewhat of a wild man; in his youth his friends called him \\"barrel\\" both because of his robust physique and his capacity for alcohol.  In short, the portrayal of Jung is a most serious distortion of the real man.<br /><br />Eugen Bleuler, the head of the Burghölzli where Sabina is hospitalized is, again, mistakenly portrayed as an authoritarian man who has little sympathy for her.  Not true: both he and Jung granted her wish to become a medical student and not a mental patient and it was this, along with Jung's love, care, and taking her on as his research assistant, that enabled her to overcome the crazed state she was in when she first came to the hospital.<br /><br />And what of the real Sabina?  The movie shows her engaged in various bizarre body distortions but gives no sense of why she is in such a state.  In fact, she was the oldest daughter of a wealthy family whose father beat and abused her and whose mother was so self-centered that when she brought Sabina to the Burghölzi, she almost never visited her, preferring to spend her time staying in a luxurious hotel and shopping.  The motheralso had the strange idea that her daughter should be completely shielded from sexuality and, even as an eighteen-year-old, she didn't understand reproduction.  Sabina, who was brilliant (she mastered four foreign languages by the age of seven), was reacting with hatred at both her father's violent treatment of her, her mother's disinterest, and the difficulties that women faced realizing their potential during these years.  She was one of those extremely energetic persons who did not hold her emotions back and most of what she displayed when she first saw Jung was in reaction to the frustrations and abuse in her life.  She displayed out of control temper tantrums, some of a childish nature, and rage.  Jung began trying an early version of psychoanalysis with her but soon found that it was more meaningful to both of them to have her participate with him as an assistant and collaborator in his research.  This, along with the granting of her request to study medicine - providing she acted appropriately in classes - led to the complete abatement of her symptoms within little more than a year.  She pursued her medical studies with ease, got her degree with Jung's assistance, and, at his suggestion, went into psychiatry and, eventually, became a psychoanalyst.  She returned to her native Russia, wrote a number psychoanalytic papers, married, had children, and helped spread psychoanalysis there until she and her family were murdered by the Nazis in 1940.<br /><br />Did Sabina and Jung have an affair?  She clearly fell in love with him and proclaimed to one and all - including her mother and Jung's wife -- that they were lovers.  His comments in letters are more ambiguous but they certainly spent a great deal of time together and, given his later affairs, it is likely that they did.  While we now know that sex with patients is destructive, in this case it seemed to be part of the love that helped her recover. There is no evidence that Jung beat her on the buttocks with aleather strap, as depicted in the movie, though she may have had such a fantasy.<br /><br />The portrayal of Freud is probably the least distorted in the movie since his main concern, as it was in fact, was luring Jung into the psychoanalytic movement as a loyal adherent.  At the same time, the movie seems to suggest that Jung's affair with Sabina had something to do with the later break with Freud as well as Jung's own breakdown.  Completely untrue, as revealed in the Freud-Jung correspondence and other biographical sources.  Many of the early analysts had sex with their patients and Freud seemed little concerned with this as long as they adhered to psychoanalytic dogma.  Jung saw Sabina in 1905, she graduated from medical school in 1911, and Jung's near psychotic breakdown occurred in 1914 when Freud, who he had come to revere as a substitute for his own weak father, rejected him.<br /><br />Louis Breger, Ph.D. and Author, \\"Freud: Darkness in the Midst of Vision\\" and \\"Psychotherapy: Lives Intersecting\\"

B0071PS7AC|2.0|For what this app is, it looks and sounds ok. The controls are not terrible, but it is difficult at times. It's easy to hook (curve) the ball or throw it straight. But you can't throw the ball straight from one corner to the other...if start on the left side of the lane and try to throw straight at 10 pin (furthest pin on the right) the ball will hook. It shouldn't do that. The controls need to be fine tuned. The biggest problem is the pin reaction. There are way too many splits. I'm throwing consistent shots in or near the pocket (between the 1 and 3 pin) and not getting strikes. The scoring needs to be fixed too. If you don't knock down pins, its not zero \\"0\\" but rather a dash \\"-\\". If you knock down all the pins on your second shot its a spare \\"/\\" not a strike \\"x\\". I'm not sure what other people are talking about with the menu. This game has one. This game isn't worth the $.99 but I think this game actually has potential. HTC Thunderbolt stock.

B00755646W|4.0|I have been waiting years for this to come out on Blu-ray and was so excited when i heard it was finally being released in high def, but then my excitement was short lived when i found out that the ONLY bonus features was the trailer...WHAT are they thinking?<br /><br />We know there are hundreds and hundreds of hours of unreleased material that Alex Keshishian filmed, we know that the Blond Ambition Tour was filmed professionally many times and released...The Nice, France show was shown on HBO and then released on Laserdisc, the Yokohama, Japan show was released on VHS and Laserdisc in Japan, the Barcelona, Spain show was shown in Europe, Australia and Canada and then of course all the footage filmed for Truth or Dare was filmed over 2 nights in Paris, France.<br /><br />They should of done a huge box set with her new Truth or Dare perfume and included at least 2 versions of the Blond Ambition tour, one with the ponytail and one without. Even the VHS had 2 bonus songs Like A Prayer and Hanky Panky, which aren't even on this blu-ray.Lionsgate could of really put together something special for the fans but really screwed up this release.<br /><br />I of course will still buy this as it is the single best tour documentary ever. All the backstage footage was filmed in grainy black and white and all the concert footage was filmed in glorious high definition color. The movie shows Madonna at her best, worst, most vulnerable and bitchiest...it also concentrates a lot on her dancers and their lives.  I would love if Madonna chose to do another documentary like TOD (She did do I'm Going To Tell You A Secret but she wasn't followed around day and night like in TOD) where everything on tour is filmed. I would imagine that we would see a much more gentle, caring and less bitchy Madonna that we saw in TOD but Madonna herself said that she would never do something like that again.<br /><br />Bottom line I would of given this release 5 stars if there were more bonus features butbecause of that it only gets 4 stars...but do yourself a favor and buy this as it is going to look amazing on blu-ray. Hopefully Lionsgate will come to their senses and release an director's cut or box set in the near future, I can only hope.

1601251556|4.0|Ordered two mats, the box they were shipped in was undamaged, but both mats had a crease on the inside of the folds. I find it very unlikely they were damaged in transit, so that means they were shipped like that. It doesn't make them unusable, just an entire row will have lopsided minis. The lines are not as dark as depicted in the picture here on Amazon, they are a grey on the mat and hard to distinguish on the sandstone side if the lighting is wrong.<br /><br />They are wonderful however, and I plan to get one of them straightened out as good as I can, and then laminate it again just so it is extra durable. If you want a cheap reusable grid, this is your best bet.

B005UKJX4E|2.0|Malick's Tree of Life exemplifies the director's arrogance for his movies. It is apparent during the long drawn out segments of the history of the universe and of Earth that Malick believes he can simply ignore plot, immersion, and interest to try to get his philosophical and artistic ideas onto the screen. However, I give this review 2 stars, not one, because there are some redeeming parts in the middle of the film where he ceases to be artistic and focuses more on the character development and family structure which actually mimics Malick's own upbringing. Perhaps this would have been better as a short, 45-minute film, but instead any semblance of a good movie is lost in philosophical nonsense which simply alienates the viewer.

It's just a well written, terrific recording with a top notch mixdown. They even stuck a little piece of 1/2 inch tape in the CD booklet just to remind you that it's an analog recording ... and the warmth of that analog is very much present. All too often, so many releases following any greatest hits or best of packages are weak, but this one's worth every penny. A best of or greatest hits release often marks the end of any real creativity and screams \\"okay, we realize our best work is behind us, so here's a convenient little package of our hits to remember us by\\". That is not, I repeat, is NOT the case with the (post-greatest hits) Wasting Light. In fact, this could (arguably) be their best effort yet. Kudos to Dave G. and his crew as they continue to deliver the goods. Very nicely done!

0783114222|5.0|A phenomenally well-done and comprehensive mini series on the history of the early space program and the people who made it all happen. My 8-year old gives this 5 stars because the system won't let him give it a 100, and I completely agree.<br /><br />I do have two parental warnings: The episode \\"1968\\" includes some graphic news footage from that year, and the episode \\"That's All There Is\\" contains some pretty strong language and small images of 1960s pinups. Neither prevented us from choosing to watch the mini series with our child, but we did block his view for portions of \\"1968.\\" During \\"That's All There Is,\\" we paused frequently to talk about how our word choices can affect other people and about how the objectification of women negatively affects both women and men.

1416583432|4.0|I have long been interested in canine cognition; but I find that many texts about dogs are either: a.) too dry and scientific and thus not enjoyable reads or b.) too unscientific, filled with glaring errors, and anthropomorphic. This book is a lovely blend of scientific knowledge coupled with excellent and compelling writing. Much of the information in the book is new or, if from well-known studies, is fleshed out and coupled with other studies that expand and deepen understanding. I particularly like the author's explanations for why various popular training methods and/ or other current fads about dogs are just plain ridiculous. Her anecdotes about her own dog and her only-too-human misconceptions about its behaviors pepper the text and add just enough whimsy. I found myself frequently nodding in recognition. Another feature of the book I enjoy is the short breakdowns of specific topics. The reader can give the book ten minutes, take in a whole lot of information, and still not interrupt the overall flow of the text, setting it aside for another 10 minute reading reward at a later time. I anticipate that there will be many disgruntled, self-proclaimed dog trainers and welling-meaning dog rescuers who take offense at the information and insights this book offers; but it is well-needed in the current climate of enthusiastic misinformation about what makes up a canine and why dogs are our companions and our soulmates, but are very different from both us and wolves.
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|I should have checked the Kindle reviews before buying.  This app does not work on the Kindle Fire.

1400063515|4.0|When it comes to this book's central thesis, I agree chance and randomness determine our lives much more than we wish to believe.<br /><br />He explains this with lots of interesting arguments and stories. This book is entertaining for anybody who's curious and willing to read with an open mind. If you are convinced you/God/the stars/the Law of Attraction etc determine your fate, you won't enjoy it so much.<br /><br />Years ago Jack Schwager published a graph of the performance of the stock market. As efficient market theorists say, the stock market daily returns forms a rough Bell Curve -- with the exception of the two tails.<br /><br />Instead of the two ends sliding down to tiny amounts, they both abruptly swept up. This indicated the stock market in reality has had far more extremely good and extremely bad days than it \\"should\\" have assuming a normal distribution.<br /><br />And that graph came before the Dot com boom, before the Tech Wreck, the 2008 financial crisis, and the summer of 2011 when Europe threatened to implode any day now.<br /><br />This serves to validate what he's saying. Sometimes things happen which you couldn't predict, and they throw all prior trends out of whack.<br /><br />Be prepared for the unexpected.
B002M3SP28|5.0|Found it hard to put down and read every page. One begins the feel a part of the story. Part fictional, part fact ... but certainly very well written. Read it as a novel and not as a National Geographic article. Its the author's version.
1592802974|5.0|This is a fascinating look at traders who are making money from stocks, commodities and currencies.<br /><br />I believe the average person reading this book should take away the lesson that these people work very hard and are very disciplined, and the average person cannot beat them in their spare time.<br /><br />Yet so many people want to try. Heck, that's the reason I read this to begin with, to learn how to be a part time trader so I could be a full time trader.<br /><br />Given these interviews are nearly 25 years old, it's be wonderful to know how these traders have fared since then. Are they still trading? Did they get wealthier? Did any of them go under? Well, we know James Rogers is still around, and writing his own terrific books on investing.<br /><br />The average person should realize they don't have an edge in the markets, and therefore should not try to compete with these guys. Buy stocks that pay dividends and reinvest them. That's the way for the average person to win. Don't play the same game these guys and their modern counterparts are playing, because they hold all the cards and know how to play a lot better than you do.

0393338827|5.0|If you read only one book on the 2008 financial crisis, this is it.<br /><br />It tells the story of the financial crisis from the points of view of the people who saw it coming, and made money from it.<br /><br />We're often told nobody understood the problem. These people did. Tiny hedge fund operator Steve Eisman, hedge fund owner Michael Burry, Deutsche Bank bond salesman Greg Lippmann, and Jamie Mai and Charlie Ledley.<br /><br />All of them except Greg Lippman were outsiders to Wall Street. Lippmann played a key role in reducing Deutsche Bank's exposure to toxic mortgage bonds, so it was not on the list of big names.<br /><br />Lewis is great at explaining the complicated financial investments. He also delves below the surface and tells us things nobody else did.<br /><br />For example, while everybody else decries the rating firms giving high scores to the toxic assets, he explains the human story of how S&P and Moody's employees were deliberately bamboozled by Wall Street.<br /><br />He also points out most of the players wound up personally wealthy and free from criminal prosecution.<br /><br />How can we prevent the next financial crisis? He's not hopeful about that.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I like it its a decent game and inferior your a hater all you two star and under your all haters
0060555661|4.0|This classic work is practically the Bible of value of investing.<br /><br />I advise reading it to understand how the minds of value investors work. They think they can buy $1.50 for $1. They can find such bargains if only they analyze enough company annual statements.<br /><br />Graham brought intelligent analysis to the field of stock selection when so many were out and out con men and hustlers. He devised ways to determine which companies were really worth buying and which not.<br /><br />If you're going to buy single company stocks, especially those of new, unproven companies, digging for facts and using rational ways to evaluate them makes a lot more sense than simply relying on tips, as so many still do.<br /><br />That said, it still makes far more sense for the average person to focus on buying established companies that pay dividends through Exchange Traded Funds that already screen out the probable losers.<br /><br />Nobody knows the future, and all value investors have picked losers, including Warren Buffett, so the method is far from flawless.

1400067936|5.0|There's a huge industry of investing advice all based on the assumption the financial markets move according to rational reasons. And if you can pin those reasons down, you can determine the market's direction, or that of an individual security.<br /><br />Some academics assert the markets move in a totally random fashion.<br /><br />This book's author is closer to the second thesis, but he also realizes, thanks partially to his personal background from growing up in a peaceful, harmonious, prosperous Lebanon only to see it slide into the radical, sectarian violence it's been infamous for since the 1970s, that sometimes things happen that don't fit the standard, normal Bell Curve financial theories and formulas are based on.<br /><br />He tells how as a trader he constantly fell short of a particular bond trader -- until the bond market collapsed in 1994, and that trader was hauled away, having lost more money in a few days than he'd made in all the years before that.<br /><br />I wish I could give this a 4 1/2 because the author is far more interested in being perceived as a philosopher than a successful trader, although I believe traders make up most of its readers. I found it in the Investing section of my library, not in Philosophy (where I never browse anyway).<br /><br />Therefore, he short-changes the trading strategies he's attacking. The trader mentioned was selling naked puts, which seem a sure-fire to make money until catastrophe strikes.<br /><br />Apparently the author buys puts, which seems a sure-fire way to lose money -- until catastrophe strikes.<br /><br />However, most people are not financially or psychologically able to follow this strategy.<br /><br />Which is one reason why I advocate investing for income, but that's another story and doesn't involve options.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire is an interesting name for the title, as the book does almost everything but. It is a solid story, told, once again, from the point of view of Katniss, and I think the author does a terrific job with her. Katniss is a typical 17 year old, moving from one extreme to the next, loving Peeta and Gale, both equally,depending on whom happens to be with her at the time. Still, with such a great character, we don't get much accomplished in the second book.<br /><br />It is hard to say from a distance why Katniss would be an interesting person. The book hints at that very subject when Katniss starts this second plunge into the arena. All the previous victors have won thru the merciless killing of others in the arena, with the exception of Peeta. So it is difficult to see why she would become the lightning rod of an entire uprising amongst the districts. Again the book points toward Peeta as a better role model, though it would be difficult to see in a real world setting how he would be the kindling to the fire in the districts either.<br /><br />Still, Collins does a great job of giving us Katniss, who, up close and personal,we see doing what needs to be done, in a remarkably human way. The book doesn't get much accomplished, and certainly doesn't catch fire, but Katniss is still ablaze in all her glory. For that alone the book is worth the read.
B005E7AOHI|4.0|I'm a long time Primus fan and own all their releases.  I give this album a lot of time to settle in before giving an honest review.<br /><br />This is neither the best or worst album in the Primus catalogue.  The fact that we have a new Primus album at all this fair into their career is wonderful.  There IS a magic here that you won't find in Les Claypool's solo albums, and it has a lot to do with the way he interacts with Larry LaLonde.<br /><br />Jay Lane is Primus' original drummer and 3rd main drummer to appear on their original material.  He's as funky as Brian, but in a flashier and different way.  Not much like Herb at all, but that's not a bad thing.  His approach brings a sense of freshness and distinguishes this album from the rest of the Primus discography.<br /><br />Song-wise, there are less standouts tracks than you may find on their classic albums.  There's no track on the class of Mud or Jerry here, but there are some wonderful songs and some unbelievable jammy parts.  It's also probably one of the easiest Primus albums to listen to without skipping any tracks (the other being Brown).  Highlights include Last Salmon Man, Tragedys a Comin, Lee Van Cleef (personal favorite), and Extinction Burst.<br /><br />The production leaves a lot to be desired, compared to their last EP \\"Animals...\\"  The drums could be a lot meatier, and the whole mix sounds a bit muddled and weak.  This is slightly better on the vinyl LP version due to the dynamic space provided, but lacks compared to the production values of Tales or Brown.<br /><br />Overall this is well worth owning if you're a Primus fan, but never expect a revolutionary masterpiece from a band this far into their career.  Catch them live if you want to enjoy the material even more, as it comes across much more powerful (HOINFODAMAN especially).  Plus, they're one of the top tier live acts out there.<br /><br />PRIMUS SUCKS!

1400069289|5.0|In the words of William James:<br />\\"All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits.\\"<br /><br />These habits develop when the brain is able to chunk a sequence of actions into an energy-efficient and automatic routine, which we then perform unconsciously. Good habits allow us to seamlessly incorporate healthy routines into our lives, with the added bonus of freeing up our brain power to focus on life's other details. On the other hand, bad habits can hijack our brains and lead us to feel as if we are prisoners of our cravings and self-sabotaging behaviors.<br /><br />Charles Duhigg's amazing book _The Power of Habit_ not only provides a fascinating exploration of the anatomy and development of habits in individuals, organizations, and societies, but it also shows how we do ultimately have the power to replace our bad habits with good ones. Duhigg explains how the three components of a habit loop are: cue--> routine--> reward, and that the key to changing any kind of habit is to keep the same cue and reward but change the routine. For example, AA works by attacking the habits that surround the drinking habit loop: it substitutes new routines (attending regular meetings instead of imbibing regular drinks) in response to the same cues (neurological cravings to ease anxiety and emotional discomfort ), while providing the same rewards (escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release).<br /><br />Neurologically savvy companies have tapped into the (economic) potential of the habit loop. The minty and frothy effect of toothpaste (which, by the way is a purely sensual effect that offers no additional cleaning power) creates a neurological craving that ensures we'll be habitual consumers of toothpaste. The manufacturers of Febreze realized that adding the \\"scent reward\\" to their product provided enough incentive for consumers to regularly incorporate the product into their cleaning routines. Target has done such extensive research on the buying habits of its customers, that it has become a master at predicting and manipulating our buying habits. (Those coupons it sends you are specifically targeted at your buying habits! &lt;Whether you find that creepy or economically beneficially is another story!>) Even radio stations have tuned into the power of the habit loop: when introducing a new song, they play it in between two familiar songs that our brains already unconsciously craves due to their recognizability.<br /><br />A little less disturbing is how companies have also been using the power of the habit loop to transform the health of their corporate cultures and help employees perform at their potentials. Starbucks, for example, helps employees build \\"willpower habits\\" to develop the self-discipline that allows them to use routines to effectively respond to daily challenges. (Perhaps these same employees could refer to this book for any on-the-job coffee habits they may have developed.) Societies also use the habit loop to drive social movements. In essence, a social movement starts with social habits of friendships, and then grows due to the habits of a community, and endures when people are able to incorporate new habits to create a sense of identity and ownership.<br /><br />The book provides insight into how we as individuals can tap into the power of habit to improve our lives. As the author points out, all habits are malleable, and once we become aware of them, we have both the freedom--and responsibility--to remake them. This modification of a habit does require the hard work that involves identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits routines, and finding alternatives. With this knowledge, every habit can be changed--from how we eat and sleep to how we  spend our time, attention, and money. Even the most addicted alcoholics can achieve sobriety, the most dysfunctional corporations can be transformed, and the most oppressive societies can be improved.  Once we make our habits visible, they become within our control, and change becomes possible. We can harness the power of habit with the insight that our habits are what we chose them to be.<br /><br />I'm so glad that my reading habit lead me to this book! I wouldn't be surprised if I become a habitual reader of Charles Duhigg. (Hey, but at least that'd be a healthy habit in my life's mass of habits!)mproved.

0062060562|2.0|I had such high hopes for Before I Go to Sleep. It seemed to have a lot of good press. Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I was disappointed by it.<br /><br />It's a psychological thriller, where the main character Christine wakes up every morning with no recollection of who she is, who the man she's sleeping next to is, where she is or even hold old she is. When she looks in the mirror, she realizes that her hair is graying and she's 47-years-old. She \\"meets\\" her husband Ben all over again every morning and he patiently explains to her that she had an accident many years ago that gave her a rare short-term memory loss/amnesia every time she goes to sleep.<br /><br />After Ben goes to work for the day, Christine often gets a phone call from Dr. Nash, a doctor who has been meeting with her in order to try to help her improve her memory. Dr. Nash tells her to check in her closet for a journal that she uses to detail each day of her life and recount the occasional recent memory she does have, before she goes to sleep and forgets everything the next morning. The journal helps Christine realize that she trusts Dr. Nash and that he's been helping her make real progress with her memory. Though on the first page of the journal she's discovers that she's written, \\"Don't trust Ben,\\" and Dr. Nash informs her that she keeps both Dr. Nash and the journal a secret from Ben.<br /><br />Early in the novel, Christine goes through this routine a number of times. She wonders why she can't trust Ben and comes across a few memories or parts of their past that he doesn't readily tell her in the morning but if pressed, he'll admit to after she's read her journal and questions him when he gets home from work. Is he lying to protect her from being hurt by the past or is there another reason he's hiding the truth from her? And why is Dr. Nash so anxious to meet with her and help her, when her own husband doesn't even know about him?<br /><br />I definitely thought this was an intriguing, unique premise for a thriller. But I got a bit tired of reading about Christine's routine--it took a while for it to be established, before getting to the meat of the story. Then once the story got going, it didn't take me long to figure out the twist, so I read the rest of the book waiting for it to be unveiled and it was hard for me to enjoy the story. Just too predictable.<br /><br />While I was clearly distracted negatively by different aspects of the book, I do think Watson is a good writer. It was easy to read, the characters really came to life and I thought it was original.ique premise for a thriller.

B0071T5PN0|3.0|My rating would be more 3.5. I was surprised by two things when I first heard this album. First, is how heavy but nimble it is. It was refreshing that most of the songs weren't that plodding, cheeky radio rock-n-roll like Tattoo (which btw has grown on me). No, the songs for the most part are fast and unhinged, closer to early DLR albums. Honeybabysweetiedoll and As Is are superb, wild tunes that hold up vs. anything on their earlier records. Honeybaby has some Fair Warning menace. Good stuff.<br /><br />The other surprise? --the FLAT, compressed recording. Wow. It's been noted by many as I read around, and they are correct. Nothing comes from the right or left or center. Nothing is in the back or up front. Everything is everywhere --and flat. No space at all for the music. No EVH rhythm in left and solo in right. No AVH tucked in nicely behind the music, nothing like that. It all comes pouring out from the same slab of space and it's a distracting shame I say. It's amazing it got to us this way.

B0018RWM9G|5.0|I've been in love with Coldplay for forevs and this record is perfect. Of course the record itself is awesome and plays perfectly but it also comes with the audio CD and an AWESOME booklet thingy and it's AMAZING. Ahhh perfect for my collection. SO COOL.
B0071PS7AC|2.0|I have defiantly played A LOT BETTER bowling games than this one!  Graphics... ehh ok, could be better. Concept ok. But putting ball to the side to get spin to it? No!!! That is not how you bowl!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|Pretty fun, i would suggest if you are having a hard time read the instructions, first game i got just over 100, second i got 273, it's not that hard if you've ever bowled before

B0050SYS5A|3.0|I had high-hopes for the Zoom before it was even released; I wanted to make better use of the kinect, since I didn't have a large room, even rearranging furniture still didn't give me the 6x6 (I'd say more like 7x7) necessary for games. So essentially, the Kinect just collected dust, like I've heard several others say.<br /><br />Anyways, bought the Zoom, and I have to say its not as awesome as I hoped, but its not quite as terrible (at least the one I got) as others say. First, you do need to be careful when putting on the Zoom, the Xbox must also be off before snapping it on. It comes with a \\"protective screen\\" which I didn't put on (wasn't sure if I'd keep the thing with all the bad reviews). The first few times the Kinect acted wonky about it, rotating up and down trying to find me. Finally, it just started working as it should, didn't really mess with anything, and it works somewhat like it says it should. It does allow the Kinect to have a wider/taller view, and works pretty well for the two games we have (Adventures and Dance Central 2). However, you do have to be actually fairly close to the Kinect, and it doesn't seem to be accurate enough to do 2 players. However, with one player, I only have to stand about 4ft back, and its great for playing and taking turns on Dance Central 2. Also, the Kinect couldn't identify who I was for the first few times, but finally seemed to learn who I was with the Zoom attached.<br /><br />Keep in mind, just like for the Kinect itself, you need to have the \\"right setup\\". We have a lamp in the background which now, thanks to the wide view of Zoom, and it shines right into the Kinect so we have to turn it off. The tracking seems almost as good as the Kinect by itself, but it randomly decides to pickup other objects as well while using the Zoom, such as the floor being highlighted in Dance Central 2, no idea why its picking that up. But, overall, since I really only use it for the one game, its been worth the low cost. Microsoft will probably release their improved Kinect next year with the next console, so we have something to look forward to, lets hope they have wider-angle lens on the thing next time, and we'll try not to cry over spending $150 on a dust-collector. The Zoom works, somewhat, but it doesn't completely solve the Kinect's limitations.will probably release their improved Kinect next year with the next console, so we have something to look forward to, lets hope they have wider-angle lens on the thing next time, and we'll try not to cry over spending $150 on a dust-collector.

1907360263|4.0|The book was in mint condition. The translation was perfect and well organized. The only thing that could have made this purchase better, is if the book itself was larger and the pages were stronger.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|This is great when I have to go out of town or really even at home. Its nice to just have a quick easy cheap workout right at your finger tips!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|The people saying theres limited or no control obviously didnt read the help section, good game! can curve throw hard or soft change ball weight etc.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|Feels allot like the real thing. the ball physics have subtle nuances that make it spin and do tricky shots. good animation makes this lots of fun.
B0071PS7AC|2.0|I don't. like this game. It has horrible controls.  Don't get this game!  I I I I I I. I I I I I I I I I I I I j I I i
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am slowly building a Madonna library after watching VH1's 100 greatest female artists of all time and Madonna was #1.  I only have the debut album to get...the rest I bought luckily for $5.00 each in the bargain bin at WalMart.  Still this CD is the one I go to if I need a pick up!  Get's me moving...let's have another real soon, Madonna.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of game options!  I don't really like that you have to unlock games by earning enough coins, but it isn't something that would keep me from playing.  great for wasting time :)
B00751K174|5.0|Love the Vampire Diaries. I would recommend this to anyone with a great imagination and open mind! All of the episodes are intense and thrilling.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I love the Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve.  It is very light and thin, therfore it doesn't take up much room.  I also like the color,graphite, that I chose.  It is awesome.

B006ON41FC|4.0|this app has what I like and if you are like me you like the dodging and collecting and trying to get to the goal and traveling at high speeds and all this app has got my approval of awesomeness!!!
B0073U2F12|2.0|I won't go into the level of detail as to who was in Darkest Hour nor who made it. I will tell you that in my, and my family's opinion... this film was bad. The effects were great up until the Aliens were actually revealed... then they looked like a bad SyFy channel rendering.<br />I loved the fact that it took place in Russia. The characters who seemed to be \\"in the know\\" as to how to avoid, and deal, with the aliens were too conveniently placed leaving the main cast really nothing to uncover for themselves. I would have much rather seen these people figure it out on their own... vs hiding out in a bunker... while others figured out everything before these people decided to come out of their cave.<br /><br />I realize that if the story followed the people who are in the thick of it all... the ones who developed the \\"Resistance\\" and the \\"electrician\\"... the budget goes up... but, this is, or rather was an original idea... and shudda been better.<br /><br />I will tell you this, as well, LOL I really wanted to like this film! Maybe the sequel if there is one will do better, because you can only go up from here.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|it is fun but it gets way to hard way to fast... but I love the game otherwise...so I guess its worth downloading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is very well-written and extremely stable. No crashes and very straightforward. No complaints and I can't think of anything it's missing.
B004UID2LC|4.0|it is very cool that you can now view and download videos in a few easy steps but the app could have a few extra features.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Secritariat is not only a great true story. This movie gave me hope when my son (lil sonhine) was fighting for his life. Doctors didn't give me much hope but this movie did. I must have watched it 100 times. It gave me courage and hope. I still watch it at least once a week. My son is now 2 years old and he loves the movie as well. This movie about the horse that God built is exciting from beginning to end. I remember the songs and have them as my ringtones now. Oh Happy Day, I'll Take you There and It's Who YOu Are will help guide me in raising my special needs son. As you can tell I am not a writer but I had to say something about how this movie kept me going on days when I thought I had nothing left to give. The cast was superb and the story in my opinion is the best ever. The way Eddie (the real Eddie) cared for and loved Secretariat is unconditional and I would loved to have know this great man. As for Penny she has taught me how to stay strong even when everyone else is knocking you down. Always stand up for what you believe in. I will teach this to my son and watch this movie with him until he says mom it think I understand what you are teaching me. Thank you Penny for telling us your story. Kathy Metz Mobile,Alabama
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really enjoy even though I haven't played many of these type of games. I am sure this will be my new addiction.
0545265355|5.0|The three books were a fast read that you did not want to put down.  Katniss was a great heroine.
B005YDLJ76|3.0|I love Beyonce and the first live version of her I watched was the I Am Tour. I LOVED that one. I guess because I saw that one first I was expecting more. Honestly to me on the 4 dvd there wasn't enough dancing for me. Most of the time she was holding her belly and singing, not doing much dancing. LOL. It was cute but I wanted to see more dancing but I understand she was pregnant. The singing was good but I just wanted more. The I AM Tour dvd spoiled me. I was also expecting to see more Les Twins on stage too. (For those of you who don't know they are stellar dancers with the air-fros from France that she found out about on You Tube \\"Les Twins World of Dance in San Diego\\"). Yeah Larry and Laurent are sexy and just give her show that \\"umpph\\" on stage. I was disappointed she didn't show much footage of them because I love those boys. Anyways overall I would say if you watched the I Am tour you may be slightly disappointed. For those of you who haven't seen her live at all or the I AM tour you will love it! I love Bey but this just wasn't as good as her last dvd.
B002RI9ZUE|5.0|Absolutely fantastic read.  I loved how it was written and you felt so drawn in and apart of her world.  Highly recommended for anyone above 15.
B004W4N55C|2.0|This app used to work just fine until it was updated and now it won't work at all.  Every time I try to open it, it decides to force close when I go and press anything. If this app is going to cost this much, I think it would be wise to make sure it works before deciding to update it. Honestly, it's called testing. Make sure the app works before you decide to upload it for everyone to download. Not only is that bad for you but then the community who actually downloads it will give bad reviews and deter others from downloading it. Instead, they'll download the competing app. Just saying...<br />UPDATE THE APP WITH A WORKING VERSION!!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|greetings fellow amazonians thanks again for all the well wishes. I left st elmo's hospital today and I feel much better. too bad derek is still recovering from my over excited ekg monitor attack.<br /><br />so I went back to work and saw rodney the office jerk who thinks he is still the quaterback of his football team and it is 1984. he told me that if I was a real man that I would join the bowling team at work. I like sports so I told him sure.<br /><br />to practice for my big event i downloaded the faotd. to my surprise it helped me and when I got to the bowling alley I was ready to take on rodney and his crew. because of all my practice I kicked butt and scored a 74. now im the captain of the bowling team and master of the office, thanks amazon for making me cool
B005GC8FKE|5.0|Breaking Bad, from Season 1 to end of last season is arguably some of the best writing, acting, directing I've ever seen on television or in a motion picture.  It is the only tv show I have EVER paid to watch-as I didn't even know it existed until I heard an interview on NPR with the actor who plays Jessee Pinkman.  Worth more than a dollar per series!
B0071PS7AC|5.0|This is the best bowling game I have played on my KF.  You can play alone or against a player.  There are 4 players with different levels. It is a little tricky to get the ball spinned but the help option shows how to control the ball.
156224003X|4.0|This book has some really interesting ideas about your mindset while playing your instrument.  I think I would go as far as saying all musicians should read it... or at least MOST.  If you're already an accomplished, professional musician and are completely confident in your playing abilities on and off the stage, then you might want to pick it up just to get a different and insightful viewpoint on the way music is taught to children.  All other players could certainly pick up at least a few useful ideas.  I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because the first several chapters are almost like teaser website ads... \\"you are going about these things all wrong because of A, B, and C. If you want MIRACULOUS results, click here!\\" (then click here, and there, and give me your credit card number).  We already bought the book, so get on with the getting on and tell me how to fix it!  The real meat and potatoes of the process aren't until chapter 9 or so!  Still, there are some great quotes and ideas in the first chapters and throughout the book.
0307946711|4.0|One Day is an engrossing story of two friends who meet at their college graduation and remain part of each others lives for the next 20 years. It unfolds with a peek into their lives on the same day each year - St Swithin's Day, July 15th. The dialogue between them is wry British humour at its best, and the time frame in which it takes place is one I could personally relate to (late 80s - early 2000s) so the pop culture references charm. Early on I struggled to believe their relationship would really stand the test of time (she, an introverted academic who loved him from afar, and he an absurdly crass extrovert who seemingly took her for granted), but the story works and you find yourself rooting for them all along. Nicholl hits you with a surprise ending, but then brings the story gently to a close through a series of well timed flashbacks. Really enjoyable read.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I absolutly love this movie I saw it twice when it came out in the theaters and it arrived earlier than I thought it would and in very good condition.
0879309210|4.0|I bought the book after reading some of Dan Erlewine's repair ideas on the web (along with spending a lot of time reading about his collaborations with Frank Ford of FRETS.COM). Dan is one of the brightest lights in the guitar repair world, and this book is absolutely stuffed to the gills with useful information.<br /><br />The book covers a variety of guitars, both in general and specific: for example, there are sections on the general theory of guitar necks and then sections about adjusting Fender electrics, Gibson flattops, Martin flattops, and a host of other instruments. As previous reviewers have noted, the book annotates each repair/setup technique with a difficulty level, which is useful in helping beginners decide whether to attempt the repair.<br /><br />My frustration comes with the very poor layout of the book. Although each page shows the chapter title and there are section headings indicated with bold text, it's often hard to figure out whether the words you're reading are part of, say, the discussion on general guitar setup or the section on Stevie Ray Vaughan's specific preferred setup. Even after I started paying attention to the layout, I still get confused and have to flip pages to make sure I'm reading the thing I wanted.<br /><br />It's a large book, well written, with lots of photographs that are genuinely useful. Be prepared to invest some time reading the whole thing so you'll be able to find the information you need later, and you'll be all set. I would definitely buy it again.

B0071PS7AC|1.0|This is a very simple & challenging bowling game app where you can bowl in either in a Group, against the computer or Solo for practice. Just go to settings in your Menu. To change amount of players, tap New Game.<br /> It has just a few basic options available such as: Sound Control of Music & Game, Ball Colors (blue, red, green or black), Ball Weight-12 to 16 lbs.<br /><br />I'd played this game for about 45 minutes; using the different weighted bowling balls options available. Now, at first it had seemed the computer had the advange because, it won EVERY single play against in the first 10 rounds! However, as I'd continued to practice & experiment with weight of the bowling balls, strategically practicing how far back & what side to toss the ball, my scores began to improve some. However, I STILL could not win a single  frame! I'm not talking about the entire game either. I'm mean just one FRAME. If I bowled a 7, the computer would bowl a 9. If I got a Strike...of course..so did the computer!  It just \\"seemed\\" obvious.<br /><br />So, I am still unable to confidently say as to whether the computer is set to beat the player or not. I would have to give the app much more game play in order to determine this for sure. (To learn how to move your ball properly, tap on the upper left hand corner of your screen. For menu options,then  settings, then tap Help. If you own a K-Fire,  just tap your Menu at the bottom of the screen)<br /><br />I did find the game to be fun as any bowling app can & I would expect any SHOULD be. Strategically, it's going to be challenging to win against the computer on this one. That is only of course, IF one has the time & patience that I did to practice with it's limited options.<br /><br />It is in my opinon, that after my own experience & considering all posted reviews, that the developers do one of two.things:<br />1. Take the app off the market so that significant improvements can be made or,<br />2. Make Vegas Bowling a FREE app.<br /><br />And, if I can't find a way to beat the computer (at least just once and, soon....it'll be uninstalled.<br /><br />1* star<br /><br />  **Tested on a Kindle Fire**r />And, if I can't find a way to beat the computer (at least just once and, soon....it'll be uninstalled.<br /><br />1* star<br /><br />  **Tested on a Kindle Fire**

082300659X|5.0|Aristides goes chapter-by-chapter through every stage of the drawing process from planning and measuring to blocking the major shapes to final touches. Many beautiful illustrations help to get through the slower parts. The thorough instructions, explanations, and technical tips are the reason I would recommend this book to a beginner (like myself). The book uses art historical references and classical design principles to demonstrate how and why the works of great masters have survived many changes of taste and remained relevant.<br />The book contains a lot of practical information about drawing supplies and techniques; very clear explanations of sight-size method, measuring (with a knitting needle or a piece of paper), identifying main lines and angles in the drawing, using plumb line to establish a vertical, and so forth. The book is printed on glossy paper with high-quality illustrations. There's also a DVD with drawing lessons.<br />This is third Aristides book I bought, in part because reading her books is like talking to a like-minded person.
B007CKB2AS|5.0|\\"Wrecking Ball\\" is a disenchanted look at the current state of affairs in the country today. A champion of the working man, Springsteen is acutely aware of the vanishing middle class. The poor are still poor, the rich are using their money to make more money and the working man is going under for the final time. In his words, he has always been aware of the difference between American reality and the American dream. The inspiration for the album comes from Bruce's dismay at the Wall Street crisis. He is frustrated that people lost their jobs and their homes while no one was held accountable and the bonus money was still being paid. Musically, Ron Aniello takes us on a tour of various Springsteen styles recalling \\"Born In The USA\\", \\"Nebraska\\", \\"The Ghost Of Tom Joad\\" and \\"The Seeger Sessions \\". Heck, a couple of songs sound like Bruce is channeling The Pogues or The Dropkick Murphys. There are going to be people who think the album doesn't stand up to the classics in his catalogue or wonder what Bruce knows about having too much month at the end of the money. Understandable, I suppose but I don't think it should diminish of Springsteen's \\"Lion in Winter\\" roar.
B004W89N72|3.0|Well, this app is simple to use, no fancy features just basic memo recording. Overall its ok, but I wouldn't get it for the $1.50 price.
B006PKQQJS|1.0|This is the worst app I've ever had. You'd think that you'd actually be able to cut hair, but you cant. It also has bad graphics. I was really dissapointed when I played this game. DONT BUY IT!!!!!
B0071PS7AC|2.0|This was obviously made to steal peoples' information.  It nothing more but a luck game.  Some would disagree with me, but I am saying this because when I roll the ball to the side it comes back and strikes.  But when I roll in a straight line to strike, it just rolls to the side.<br />Also, the game level is preset to hard!  It virtually impossible to beat this game.<br />Now think about downloading this app...
B006GX3ONK|5.0|The extended versions and extra tracks on these albums have all been remastered and sound much better than the CD singles of each that were released in the early 1990's. In addition, the 12&#34; German mix of New Gold Dream is longer at 7:01 than the version that was released on 12&#34; as they've added the opening fade-in from the album mix of the song.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Finished in one day because I couldnt put it down! I can't wait to read the next book in the series and to see the movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|like the option to play Vegas style and one or three card deals. don't like the pop up ads but that's life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I truly loved this book, enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. Collins' trilogy exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this book the general public. Thanks Collins for a great novel, I couldn't put it down. When I did put this book down, I couldn't stop thinking of what will happen next with Katniss and the challenges ahead. Overall, best book I've read in a while.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|Everything works great on my HTC Incredible running 2.3.4. If your bright enough to figure it out, you can either hit the menu button or the little arrow in the upper left hand corner of the screen to bring up the menu. From there you can choose a solo game or opponent, change your ball color &amp; weight &amp; it even has a help section that explains how to play the game.  It's basic. It's pretty fun. It's bowling. It also has pretty good graphics. Other than the fact that they could use the money won to buy new balls or something, it's a good game. Also there are no outlandish permissions &amp; it won't take up a lot of room on your device. Almost the perfect game.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Listening to this really makes me want to see the show.<br /><br />There's lots of things I love about this.  I've been a Beatles fan all my life. I enjoy hearing these remixes which manage to be both faithful to original recordings while at the same time providing surprising little twists and innovations like the juxtaposition of the \\"Blackbird\\" guitar work with \\"Yesterday\\". Listening to the DVD version in surround sound is just amazing.  There are things here that I'm noticing for the first time despite having heard these songs many times before. This is a great survey of Beatles tunes with concentration on the mid to later catalogue. Bless George Martin for doing this.<br /><br />Unless Paul McCartney and/or Geoff Emerick come up with another project, I guess this is the last we will have from the original Beatles.  That makes me a little sad. Soon they will belong to the ages instead of just to those of us lucky enough to have been around for the ride.<br /><br />And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've read a bunch about people using remote desktop type programs/apps before, but didn't really see the need for it and never bothered to really look into it. I picked this up on an app sale from amazon, and am so happy I did. I use it on both a tablet, and on my phone (galaxy nexus) and it's great. Who needs to stream from the cloud when you can access all of your files directly on your home pc and play them through your device directly! I use this for watching videos, listening to music, and the occasional logging in to video games to tinker or do some minor grind work. It's also been super helpful on the rare occasion where I needed a file from my home machine, and I just email it to myself through splashtop. Admittedly, I haven't used other remote desktop apps, so I don't know if this is the best, but I have had no complaints about it so far.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|The macro range is very similar to the one you would get with an extension tube, and the depth of field is also as narrow. But the captured images are sharper.

B007H51DQG|4.0|*** SPOIL ALERT ***<br /><br />The story overall from an entertainment perspective wasn't to bad for me. The living and the dead were at it again and finally they are starting to use hand weapons instead of firearms. The part where daryl (Norman Reedus) knifes the zombie in the head was quite classic. And then Carl just about pooing his pants when was the zombie got partially free was just great. For that part, I was wondering whether Carl was going to kill the zombie or not. In fact, I was wondering the whole time if Carl was going to kill the prisoner. Something to think about.<br /><br />A couple of things:<br /><br />1. The whole story itself needs to pick up the pace. The writers are spending to much time being a soap opera, even though zombies are involved. There is so much more then a simple farmhouse compared to the rest of world around them. I do understand though that leaving the farmhouse could be quite hard especially with all of the supplies that are needed are readily available.<br /><br />2. I have found Dale to be quite annoying. It's like he's trying to live in a dream world or something where everything needs to be fair. Wake up dude! Zombies have taken over the world, people who were once those nice neighbors of yours are no longer nice. It is survival of the fittest. The weak die and the strong live. Shane had it right when he was theorizing about letting the prisoner loose. Rule of law is out the window and civilization is pretty much kaput or least can't be restarted until a few billion pesky zombies are taken care of first.<br /><br />3. If the group finds putting this kid to death hard, wait until you have issues of starvation, cannibalism, rapists, murderers, etc, other groups, zombie herds, and oh, the governor. How do you deal w/ those situations? On top of that, how much can AMC really show on TV? Do you think the writers can push the limits of what is acceptable and go as far as what the movies \\"The Road\\" did with Viggo Mortesen or \\"TheBook of Eli\\" with Denzel Washington did since these are different yet similar situation?<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how the writers pull this off. All of the characters need to be challenged a bit more then what has happened so far. Overall, I am anxious for the next episode.
B003QCCS36|3.0|Well ... I tried. And I just don't get the appeal of this at all. It's not awful, just nothing special. After reading reviews, I bought this CD at a shop in Kuala Lumpur, thinking it would be a safe pick, maybe a good representation of Ray Lamontagne's music. So what am I missing? I find the songs rather weak overall, nothing very memorable or exciting. And his vocals don't do anything for me at all. If anything, the sound of his voice is one of the weak points to this album. Maybe he has better albums, but I'm not motivated to try any more after this disappointment.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Just as good as the first book, except it doesn't have a slow beginning. This book picks up not to long after the first book ends. Great read, BUT READ THEM IN ORDER
B003GK21ZI|5.0|This is a book in the true Ken Follett style.  It is impelling and infectious reading from the start of the first page until the last.  It is based loosely on a real war hero but not sure how close it is to the true events.  No matter though because it is a very good read all the same.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|In order to really appreciate the books, read this one in close succession to the second book, in my opinion the 2nd and 3rd book are just one large one that was too big for print. loved how it all came together

B0071PS7AC|5.0|I've tried just about every bowling app available and this one blows them all off the map.  The throwing action is very realistic as is the sound, the behavior of the pins and the overall experience.  I like having a visible opponent and it's a credit to the developers' that he/she takes a fair turn at losing games and having badly thrown balls.  Great job...I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys good action without the blood shed.  Bravo!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|She really is. Her story is haunting. I had to turn away several times while many tears were shed for her as well. Reading this true account makes me realize how evil, diluted, and plain disgusting some can be. On the other hand, people like Jaycee Dugard are just plain amazing in all her goodness and strength.<br />Buy this book and take the time to really read it. Although it is at first a horrifying tale, towards the end you come to understand the true love Ms. Dugard has with her family and life. She has my complete and total respect. I only wish that I can send her a letter to thank her for letting me read her story. I hope she has the most wonderful undisturbed life now. If anyone in this world deserves it, she is certainly one of them.

B005XBA9Y8|5.0|50 CDs from the Mercury Living Presence series released in the early to late 1990s (the 51th CD is a bonus, with an interview with Wilma Cozart Fine, the producer, from the early 1950s to 1964,  of many of those already legendary reissues, and the wife of C. Robert Fine, the sound engineer who really MADE the sound of Living Presence, thanks to his \\"minimalist\\" approach to microphoning): of course, this reissue is as much about what is NOT included as what is. Between 1990 and 1995 Philips/Universal released more than 100 reissuses from the Mercury catalog - I've counted 135 CDs (some in 2- or 3-CD sets) excluding the two compilations \\"You Are There!\\" - transfered and remastered with loving care from the original masters by Mrs Cozart Fine. Some were also later issued in SACD form (I am aware of 20 releases), but apparently those were not produced by Wilma Cozart Fine, and, unlike the straight CDs, they weren't made using the restored original Mercury \\"vacuum-type Westrex film recorder and Amex 3-track tape machine\\". Anyway, those SACDs are now selling at very unreasonable prices, and likewise with many of the original CDs, also offered at steep prices on the secondary market, so it is good to have at least part of them (50 / 135 makes 37 %) back at less than 3 dollars a disc. The set will be very welcome at least to newcomers who wouldn't have most of them already. Not my case: I have too many already to make it worthwhile to replace the whole, just to get the few I am missing. So I'll have to keep scouting on the net in search of affordable opportunities.<br /><br />All the CDs on this collector's edition are straight reissues from the original CDs, with no reshuffling of material. No cause for concern here: those original CDs were very generous in timing. This collector's edition gathers all the Janis from the Mercury CD series (5 CDs), the Bachauer (4 CD), the Szeryng (3 CDs), the Romeros (3 Cds), 6 Starker out of 7 (missing is the Chopin Sonata), 2 Kubelik outof 4 (missing Dvorak's New World and the Kubelik/Dorati compilation of Hindemith Schoenberg Bartok Kodaly). 14 CDs conducted by Dorati (other than Concertos) provide the main bulk of the programs featured in the box, but still those selections only skim the surface. Among the missing ones are his complete Brahms and Tchaikovsky symphonies and Swan Lake, his two Respighi and two Rimsky CDs, his Schoenberg-Berg-Webern collection with the London Symphony Orchestra, three Bartok out of 5, Dvorak Symphonies 7 & 8, Beethoven Symphonies 5-7. The Paray selections are only apetizers, out of 18 Paray CDs the box offers a paltry 2. There are 6 out of the 18 Fennell CDs (I can certainly do without 12+ hours of Marches!), 3 out of 16 Hansons (only one out of three of himself conducting his own works, and not his Gershwin with Eugene List), and none of the 3 Puyana CDs. The rest is the famous Russian Balalaika and one Skrowacewski.<br /><br />Here's the Edition's complete content. The Mercury Living Presence series is not entirely easy to track down on this website, because not all are listed under the label Mercury: some come under Philips, some others under Polygram Records. Unfortunately I cannot provide the product links to each original CD release, since these reviews are limited to 10 such product links: and it's a little under 50 (accounting for the 2-CD sets) I'd need to provide here, on top of which come the SACDs. But I will at least provide the label numbers of the original CD, the ASIN numbers, and those of the SACD reissue when relevant. Since the booklet that comes with the box apparently doesn't provide the info about recording dates, I will do so. The recording dates I provide are collated from various sources: the individual CDs when I have them, but also the mammoth Mercury discography compiled by Michel Ruppli and Ed Novitsky (volume IV has the chronological listing of the Mercury Living Presence classical records, [[ASIN:0313290342 The Mercury Labels: A Discography Volume IV The 1969-1991 Era and Classical Recordings (Discographies)]]), and the comprehensive and detailed discography of the London Symphony Orchestra by Philip Stuart (it is now hosted on the website of CHARM, the Research Center for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music). I have found no discrepancy between Stuart and Ruppli/Novitsky; there are a few (but rarely more serious than a few days) between them and the dating provided on the CDs. In some cases where I've been able to check, the booklets were wrong and the Ruppli/Novitsky dating was right (no way Mercury could have been recording Paray's Auber Overtures in Detroit on April 4, 1959, AND Dorati's Petrouchka in Minneapolis. So Ruppli/Novitsky's 20 April for the latter is more likely), and in another case, it was the other way around (the dating of Janis' Pictures at an Exhibition).

0375869026|2.0|August (Auggie) was born with facial deformity, to avoid the extra stares his parents have always homeschooled them.  Auggie is about to start the fifth grade and he'll be going to public school for the first time.  The novel is broken up into several parts, giving the reader insight into many of the characters.  In part one reader comes to know Auggie, as he shares his world and experiences.  Auggie is doing his best to fit in at his new middle school and make friends.  I enjoyed the first half of this novel but it lost me soon after the narrative moved away from Auggie.  The emotional aspect of the novel started to feel a bit forced.  A few of the characters came across as one dimensional, especially Jillian, the bully. I am all for emotional and sensitive reads but not when they over done. Towards the end I found it a bit strange that some of the minor secondary characters were able to take over narrative. I would expect Auggie's older sister Via to get a few chapters and I enjoyed those. Though later in the novel I was thrown for a loop when later in the novel, Via's new boyfriend who was just introduced takes over the telling . Neither of Auggie's parents who have been in the story since the beginning have a part to call their own but this new character just steps right in a gets a part.  There's a chapter with correspondences, including letters, and emails that felt a bit out of place. There is no denying that Auggie is a likeable character, his honest narrative easily pulls the reader into the story.  As does watching Auggie's family come together to protect and love him. Though for me it simply didn't work as much as I would've liked
B0064MT1QW|5.0|Excelent movie, but sad. Too bad they don't make movies like this one anymore. The acting, photography, sound, everything was well matched for a good and unusually long movie. No wonder it got the Oscar.
1402210086|5.0|This was my first Georgette Heyer novel, and I must say it was absolutely perfect! Sweet, sassy, and fun...a great regency!
0688014291|4.0|This is a must read, I read this book about 15 years ago, better the second time.It is a timeless book, read at difference point in your life, meaningful all the way through,
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great Buy exept for the material..... Gotta B really really careful with it like the back sleve attracts pet hair. And the front and back outside cover is a matted finish soo you can see scratch marks or food marks.
B004EPZ070|3.0|The novel Something Borrowed, written by Emily Giffin, is a great book. I was disappointed by the film though. To me, they changed too many things about the story. First of all, the character of Ethan lives in England throughout the entire story. The character of HIlary, Rachel's work friend whom she confides in about her affair, is written out entirely. I watched the movie with my mother and drove her crazy with the number of times I shrieked \\"this is not in the book!\\" I understand that movies often make small changes in their adaptations, but this was ridiculous.<br />I feel as though the casting was off too. Although Kate Hudson acted suitably obnoxious as Rachel's over-confident best friend, I didn't really buy it. I felt as though she was trying too hard, and there were moments where her natural likability shone through. I would have cast a different actress as Darcy. She was supposed to be a brunette anyway! The character of Dex came across as wimpy, which he doesn't in the book. And the whole part with his parents, his mother's depression and them buying the couple a house was also not in the story.<br />If I had watched the film without reading the book, I would have thought it was a mediocre but vaguely enjoyable rom-com. Definitely not a stand-out. But for anyone who has seen the film and not enjoyed it, don't let it put you off reading the novel. I know it can't be easy to adapt any novel to the big screen, but I don't feel that the movie really did the book justice.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good I keep coming back over and over to play games and earn points. Some of the mini games are easy and some are hard
B003EYVXSW|5.0|The Splice movie was sent to me from MightySilver on time and in the as new condition stated. My DVD had \\"Rental Copy\\" printed on the jacket, but showed no signs of ever having been released. Great movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but have to say it wasn't worth the hype.  I mean I was expecting Harry Potter to the nth power.  I don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a really good book because it was.  But I think the hype outran the actual quality.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read a lot of science fiction, and I read a lot on my Kindle, so I spent some time searching for good scifi on the Amazon site.  I came across this series (it wasn't hard to find, it's pretty highly ranked for scifi) recently and absorbed it quickly.  The serial falls into the general category of \\"small population dystopian future/hidden external world with secrets\\", and the author competently explores the world he creates (a 100+ level silo dug deep into the ground).<br /><br />Some of the things that I thought were really interesting (although hard to really believe) were the self-sufficiency attained by the silo: it includes a working oil derrick, petroleum processing plant and a single generator that provides power to the silo (including a demanding server farm and hydroponics farm along with a population of thousands).<br /><br />It explores a number of interesting avenues, such as methods to keep populations stable and maintaining a long-term mission using deception in the face of uprisings.  I think some parts of the story really stretched credulity, but for the most part I had no trouble believing in the world and its creations.
0897500482|5.0|This book contains Bruce Lee views on Martial Arts & Philosophy.  Bruce Lee studied Wing Chun under Ip Man, Philosophy in college and thus combine both in his perception of reality. But of course reality exist independent of man perception of it.  For informatin of perception of reality, read [[ASIN:1590770757 Looking Out for #1]].<br /><br />This book contains lots of Bruce Lee thoughts from information he has gather over the years.  The thoughts is not original and has existed for thousand of years.  But here, it was written down and put into words before it is forgotton.<br /><br />When Einstein created theory of relativity, Newton discover gravity and created the law of motion, they must have had many thoughts about the subject before they finally created the simplified version that exist today. If we were able to have their thoughts during the discovery process, we can call it Tao of Relativity or Tao of Gravity.<br /><br />Thus this book is an excellent companion during your road of discovery.  You need not feel lonely during your road of discovery with Bruce Lee as your companion in your journey of discovery.<br /><br />Too bad Bruce Lee was covertly assassinated by the XXXX mafia.<br /><br />Personally I only have the following to say.  I got rip off.  I purchase this item in the 80s and it does not say \\"Best Seller\\" like the picture on Amazon.  So I got an inferior book because mine does not say \\"Best Seller\\".  Don't get rip off like I did and make sure your book say \\"Best Seller\\".  If it does not say \\"Best Seller\\", return it for your money back.  I would return my book for a refund but I think the seller probably went out of business, retired or dead by now.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Great application. Have a lot of fun with it. The only thing I wish is instead of giving everyone your ID you should be able to press a button to request as a neighbor.
B000007MVZ|5.0|I read about these guys back in 1984. I loved their huge guitar sound was so similar to U2. Then they blew up the whole concept of what they were and went towards Irish Folk Music which was also amazing. H
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The only thing this series left me wanting of was MORE!<br /><br />I've picked up a few more now of this author's works (again based on reviews), we'll see but...<br /><br />The Wool series is the kind of books that will change the way you think forever (and not in a bad way). The current world, when viewed through the goggles of the characters in Wool makes everything around us appear that much more intense. Since I've finished the Wool Omnibus, The feeling hasn't left me yet across two different continents (that might also be jetlag, but this series really touched me, and not in the same places Uncle Jim used to.)
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I WATCHED THE SERIES WHEN IT WAS FIRST ON TV. THEN AGAIN WHEN IT WAS IN RERUNS. DECIDED TO PURCHASE IT AND WOW, JUST AS GOOD THE THIRD TIME AROUND. THE ACTING, SETTINGS AND COSTUMES WERE ALL 5 STAR.  IT IS ONE OF THOSE SERIES THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO SEE THE NEXT EPISODE RIGHT THEN. AMAZON HAS ALWAYS TREATED ME FAIR WITH GREAT PRODUCTS, FAST SERVICE AND FAIR PRICES.
B00127RAJY|5.0|So, I've been using this video for a couple years now (off and on).  It was sort of my \\"gateway drug\\" into getting me to start a workout regimen.  I just finished a round of p90x, which was amazing...  Once in awhile I would be super short on time and couldn't commit to a full hour or more with the program, so I'd supplement this video.  I was a great help to keep me on track.  You really do get a great, well-rounded workout with this vid.  Would highly recommend.  I have gifted this vid to several of my friends, and every single one of them are now converts.  I will be using this dvd for many years to come.  It's already a modern classic, IMHO.  I aslo have her Ripped in 30.  I love them both.  If I had to decide between the 2, I'd probably choose Shred.  It's a close call, but I just enjoy Shred a tinsy bit more.  I think it's because in Ripped there are a few moves that are just ever so slightly more complicated, which is fine.  I'm just not to most coordinated person on the planet, and I suppose I just prefer things a little more simple at times.  In my opinion, both workouts are equally effective, however.
0241951615|4.0|This is an unforgettable portrait of England's decline and fall, as embodied in the story of one aristocratic Catholic family -- with a flicker of transcendent hope at the end. A rewarding way to spend 11 hours of commuting time, if you listen to the audio version.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|This is hands down the worst bowling game ever made. I think even free is too much. A poor design and terrible graphics don't waste your time.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|What an amazing movie. God works in mysterious ways. This movie has made me aware of so many weaknesses and strengths in my life. I hope when you watch this movie you will be more than blessed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book gave me a ton of answers I was hoping for from the first book on top a total Mind F*** of a twist. You have to read it. Even though the first one felt like a good ending and even though there were unanswered questions. Questions are answered, and more are asked. Buy it and read it. Easy read. 10 hours & read it straight through, and I'm a moderate speed reader. DO IT!
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|I've been a fan for many a year, and I've been waiting on this one... well worth the wait. They seemed to be a little redundant on the last album, and this is everything but. I've been asking for some NEW music, and boy did they deliver with the same style and charisma that sucked me into them to begin with....great job guys!
B005YVSIZ4|3.0|I agree somewhat with the criticism that there is a lot of nothing much in the first half of Season 2 of The Walking Dead. My real gripe is that what they are saying is not helping to develop these characters into people that you care about or really NOT care about, which is important if this show is going to last. However, the zombie action is still gripping (and icky).
B004W4N55C|5.0|Two more gadgets made obsolete by the smartphone.  I don't do much with the tabs, but the tuner and metronome are excellent.  Totally worth the price!
B000EGDC0A|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this album has some strong pieces on it (Namely: Ooh lala, Satin Chic, Number 1 and Beautiful, and maybe a couple others), but somehow I felt a little underwhelmed by this album (as I was with Black Cherry). I know that Goldfrapp has a very large range in terms of their sounds (the mellow beauty of 7th tree so far seems to be my favourite), but knowing what I could possibly expect from them I was still not 100% happy with this album.<br /><br />Word of advice: look up all the tracks on youtube before buying the album.. to make sure you'd like the majority of them. I should have.. not sure why I didn't.
0307593312|5.0|This is an extraordinary piece of literature.  My entire family is reading it at the same time right now.  I highly recommend this book.
0375869026|5.0|WONDER by R. J. Palacio<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book! Yes, I know it's a YA and I'm a senior citizen, but the August (Auggie) Pullman, the young hero cast a spell over me from the first page.<br /><br />Auggie was born with a terrible facial deformity. Despite many surgeries to make it possible for him to live, nothing could be done to fix how he looks. He's been sheltered by his family who love him and try to protect him every step of the way, including home schooling.<br /><br />When the book begins Auggie is about to start regular school. What a brave step for this kid to take--and none of it is easy.<br /><br />This is story about strong family love, friendships and betrayal, and bullying. I couldn't help but pull for Auggie every painful step of the way.<br /><br />The author did a great job showing us Auggie's feelings and the members of his family and some of his friends.<br /><br />Marilyn Meredith aka F. M. Meredith<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who loves a great tale about the human spirit.

B003ES5ZPK|4.0|It's difficult to use the rear hdmi ports on a wall mounted televisions.  This adapter allows you to access those rear ports without risking damage to your television or cables.  I would recommend to a friend and I will likely buy more myself.
