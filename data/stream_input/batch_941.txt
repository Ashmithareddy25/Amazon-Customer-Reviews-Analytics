055357342X|5.0|Hard to review this book without giving away some major plot twists, but let's just say if you're a fan of certain characters from Book 1 or Book 2...get ready to say good-bye to them in Book 3.  I will say I'm incredibly glad Mr. Martin has not only kept Jon Snow front and center (well, kind of), but has given him a great character arc.  My fingers are crossed we see even more of him in Book 4.  I also love Arya and Tyrion...will be interesting to see what's in store for them.  My only gripe with this series is the lack of \\"fantasy\\"...meaning, if you're expecting wizards battling it out on top of dragons, so far through 3 books and about 3,000 pages...that hasn't happened yet.  But, a very highly recommended series anyway.  Especially for anyone who loves a brand new world as richly constructed as A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin!!!

B001F12J48|1.0|DO NOT BUY THE 3D VERSION OF THIS FILM.    Yes, I like the movie, but the 3D version is awful!!  The 3D version should not be available for purchase.    It is the worst thing I have seen. The 3D imaging is blurry and there is very little of it.    Stick with the regular DVD version.    Please, please don't waste your money!

While every episode has a story that ends at the end of each episode, there are additional plots that are intertwined throughout multiple episodes.<br /><br />If you like fantasy shows, I highly recommend this show.

061861169X|5.0|The Polar Express will leave you with a warm feeling.  All the smells and memories of childhood will come floating back to you.  I read this to my youngest daughter when she was 3 and she totally fell in love with it.  Every Christmas since then she gets something with a silver bell on it.  It has ranged from a sterling silver bell on a ring to a dime store bell, but she has kept them all and loves them.  My other daughter liked the book, but did not feel the same way.
B001PR0YDA|5.0|Over the years I've seen at least a dozen versions of Dickens's \\"A Christmas Carol\\", and this one, dynamic and evocative, ranks among the very best, I saw it in an Imax theater in three D, and the special effects were stunning. The very rapidly moving aerial views of London were spectacular with a beautiful shot of St. Paul's Cathedral. Victorian England came to life because the director had paid attention to detail, authenticity. The wintry, slippery streets of London were part of the atmospherics.<br /> I was never really aware that Scrooge was being played by Jim Carrey because the make-up and computer effects similar to \\"Polar Express\\" submerged and camouflaged the person. He did a great job, even better by my lights because I've never been much of a Carrey fan. The sharp jutting chin in the young and old Scrooge reminded me of a character drawn by Toulouse-Lautrec. Scrooge was amazingly thin and emaciated. The three ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future are all played by Carrey though I never realized until I read the credits.<br /> The movie was fast-paced. I have seen rather stately, pokey versions in the past, but this one zipped along as it concentrated almost entirely on Scrooge. The three visits of the three Christmas ghosts initiated by the dead partner Marley were done with alacrity. Scrooge goes flying off into space like a rocket.<br /> This film has a comic book or graphic novel look to it with some scenes looking like drawings, paintings that have come to life. There are some funny touches as when Scrooge balks or shows a wise guy side as he talks to the ghosts. You get the essentials of the story, a lot of action and movement, without being bogged down by some of the old familiar stuff. The Roger de Coverley dance in Scrooge's past was well done. Some of the characters in the dance sequence are Pickwickian. Scrooge's stinginess and acquisitiveness are evoked by the stacks of coins on his desk as a young and old man.<br /> The street scenes were cleverly recreated. Kids were rolling hoops with sticks, sliding down icy hills on their feet which Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) imitates later. Some kids hitched themselves onto the rear of fast-moving wagons and foot-skied behind, and Scrooge does it after his redemption. Of course the theme of the story is how the real spirit of Christmas can bring about redemption.<br /> It has a truly Dickensian flavor using some of his actual dialogue, description and narration. The Cratchits' prosaic roasted goose inspires Scrooge to send them a turkey.<br />For kiddies and adults in the audience the story comes alive with added dimensions. This is a reimagined version, done with originality and creativity. It may be too scary for little tots.ecreated.

Her live performance in front of thousands impressed me. Some how the CD does not have the charisma Susan Boyel had on stage  it's  overtones are if  it was a rehearsal.  I rate this CD as with three stars. Susan bring up the tone and the beat that won us all over.<br /><br />Susan drop Simon Cowell and get a real music manager.<br /><br />Robert Geco
B000053VHO|5.0|If you like Led Zeppelin & you like the Black Crowes...that's nice. But if you like the best kick*ss music in the world.....buy this cd set! What you get here is an ultimate mix of songs (many that are not the standard Led Zep radio tunes) busted out in PERFECT TIGHT arrangement. Custard Pie, Ten Years Gone, The Lemmon Song....not to mention the countless others. (By the way, if you buy the \\"Import\\" version you get two extra tracks -- Not what you's guess either & totally friggin' awesome!).      THIS IS BY FAR, THE 'BEST' LIVE ALBUM I'VE EVER HEARD ON CD.     This CD set gets BETTER every time I listen to it. You can't go wrong with this. Buy it, crank it up & rip off the knob. You'll be happy you did!    It's one of those albums that sounds better loud & you find yourself playing either air-guitar or air-drums to. Excellent!

0596522347|5.0|Improving a slide presentation is a never ending challenge so any constructive tips can only improve matters. When I noticed Slide:ology I was a bit skeptical about learning anything new, but it was worth taking the chance. When the book arrived I was impressed first by its size. I wondered how anyone could dedicate over 200 pages to slide:ology. I cracked it open the day it arrived and immediately I could tell that this book would be the most educational authority that I had ever read on the subject. Nancy Duarte is obviously very experienced with presentations. Not only does she tactfully note the do's and don'ts she goes in depth to explain why certain things should be done or not. This is a must for anyone doing presentations. It's also a tremendous reference book that you'll be able to refer to over the years. Well done Nancy! This will surely help my presentations beginning tomorrow.

0440238153|4.0|One of the first noticeable aspects about Pullman's final book in the His Dark Materials series is his willingness to tackle head on aspects of life that are categorized as being either morally right or wrong. It can easily be seen as a thematic book that condones homosexuality, atheism, and murder, but that's a simple base analysis of the book.<br /><br />However, if any of those subjects disturb you, then you should leave this book on the shelf.<br /><br />I truly believe this book is a teacher's dream come true, because it follows one of my main teaching principles. You expose the real world to students and tell them they are at an age to come to their own conclusions. I realize this book isn't for everyone, but the series ends on a high note.<br /><br />By the end, you learn this book is a coming of age story centering around Lyra and Will. The two of them are completing their destiny and end up discovering who they are as people, what true spirituality means to them, and the beginning of one's first love.<br /><br />Characters return from the previous books as Lyra sets out to find the world of the dead. While we follow her and Will, we learn of the final challenges that Ms. Coulter and Lord Asriel face. What readers will enjoy is that any questions lingering surrounding Lyra's parents and their true allegiances is finally revealed in a way that could only make sense.<br /><br />There are segments that seem to linger longer than usual, especially where the Mulefa are concerned, but by the end all of the side stories are seamlessly tied together.<br /><br />People may questions whether Pullman is able to pull off the prophecy and if Lyra is a symbolic representation of Eve. I think there is no definitive answer on this, because each person will interpret the ending differently. I can easily see people disagree over it.<br /><br />The ending wasn't what I would have wanted for Will and Lyra, but Pullman does acknowledge that life isn't beautiful and perfect. All loose details and questions were answered to my full satisfaction.<br /><br />As always, Pullman's writing is exquisite.<br /><br />If one can complain about the book, it would be about the notion of Lyra and Will creating their own Kingdom of Heaven on earth. How can they really recreate paradise if they are not with the people they love? I question it, but I would assume that Pullman would respond that they were separated, because in the end they were destined to be apart. It may also depend on Pullman's interpretation of what a Heaven on earth would look like.<br /><br />The book is wonderful, but like most series, if you wanted a sugary sweet ending you will be disappointed. However, if we really analyze the series, from the start, Pullman flirted with taboo subjects and took his readers on an unexpected roller coaster ride.loose details and questions were answered to my full satisfaction.<br /><br />As always, Pullman's writing is exquisite.<br /><br />If one can complain about the book, it would be about the notion of Lyra and Will creating their own Kingdom of Heaven on earth.

B001TOD92C|5.0|I was expecting the Wrestler to be a film focusing on the wrestling career of a character portrayed by Mickey Rourke, but instead, it's a story focusing on the LIFE of a wrestler portrayed by Mickey Rourke.     Going into the movie, well, I've been a big wrestling fan for over 15 years now. Sometimes I watch wrestling on TV constantly (specifically WWE wrestling) other times I go through phases where I'd rather watch something else instead.     However, despite how I may feel about wrestling at whatever moment in time, the one thing that never changes is the fact that I've personally cried when many wrestling stars have died at a young and unexpected age, because for years, I've been reading about everything these superstars have to go through in order to put on a show and entertain the fans. Everyone from Owen Hart, to Eddie Guerrero to the British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith.     They will always be remembered by wrestling fans for their hard work and talent.  The Wrestler really focuses on the struggles of wrestlers who make a living by putting on entertaining shows.    Mickey Rourke does an INCREDIBLE job showing us what sports entertainment wrestling is really like. Everything from the kind of shape these superstars have to be in on an everyday basis, to the way they bleed in the ring, to the way the wrestlers interact with each other before and during matches, to the way they sometimes DO take REAL damage when they smack either other (such as during those extreme matches that focus on tables, barbed wire, chairs, and other dangerous weapons)- this movie covers all the aspects of a wrestling superstars career.     The film even covers what happens AFTER a wrestling match, and focuses on the condition these wrestlers are in when they return home.     Without spoiling anything, I'm really surprised over the fact the film does NOT focus entirely on wrestling. Instead, the first 45 minutes show us some wrestling, then the next 45 minutes focus on Mickey Rourke's character and the people he interacts with (especially the woman in his life- a LOT of attention was given to this aspect of the storyline) and then the film finishes up with the wrestling aspect to end the movie.     What is a bit on the disappointing side is the ending. It leaves a few questions unanswered, some of them BIG questions. Who knows what really happened after that final scene?     Anyway, the movie probably deserves all those awards it won last year, because the movie has that distinct quality about it that makes the general population really appreciate the time and work that went into it. Probably a classic film, especially for wrestling fans.
B002IT5OU2|5.0|If I could have only one book of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" this is the one that I would want.  The illustrations are beautiful.  The price was terrific.  I liked mine so much that I ordered one for a friend.  Love it.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Don't waste your DVD purchase dollars on this one. If you missed it in the theaters you did not miss a Bond movie. No gadgets. No fun. No \\"Bond, James Bond\\". He doesn't even say \\"Shaken not stirred\\". The producers/directors decided instead of trying out their approach with their own creation, decided to steal someone else's creativity. Oh, by the way their creativity isn't their own either; Watch a Bourne Identy movie. Better story, better action, and filmed better too.    Where's the Bond?
B001NESPHC|5.0|I first discovered Melody with this album and the lead track Baby I'm A fool earlier this year... \\"Baby...\\" is such a great track and a very good representation of the album.    It all sounds so soulful and sincere...  nowadays, there is a real trend to try to be retro and recreate old styles of music, it would be easy to dismiss Melody as just another bandwagon-hopper trying to sound like an old style jazz singer... but Melody is so convincing.. this music is perfect for her and her voice is lovely to listen to...     She hasn't gone the big band route or an album of standards, mostly it's her own work and this album is a great collection of soulful and soothing numbers. Her music is never overly complex or showy... it's her voice and her thoughtful lyrics that carry her work not big fancy arrangements. There is something understated yet beautiful about Melody's work here and on her debut.     I think this album is a definite progression from her last... her songwriting definitely is improving ... the songs feel more fleshed out this time and are not as short or fleeting as on her debut ... you can sense real progress here.    I love the catchy Who Will Comfort Me, the jaunty If The Stars Were Mine (particularly the version without orchestration), and  the many soulful ballads like Your Heart Is As Black As Night, Our Love Is Easy, Lover Undercover,  The Rain and My One And Only Thrill....    Mostly, the album is ballad-centred.... But if this is your cup of tea, then you will love this album, great to just chill out to and think.... A very introspective style of album and definitely one for those moods.    Now, I'm sure some will find this too boring, too samey maybe... but I think you are missing the point if you do... if you are looking for something uplifting, up tempo... then this album certainly isn't for you... the only party this will start is a subdued style dinner party... not a wild night out.  And that is no crime, its nice to have some music to just chill to and relax to at times when the mood takes you...    I for one am sold, and will definitely be picking up Melody's future releases if this work is anything to go by. Enjoy!
0312360266|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. Couldnt put it down. Just waiting for the next one to come out. I think there is about 5-6 of them already out. Make sure you buy the collection to save some money. Dont just get one to test it out. I promise you will read every book out.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I discovered Melody earlier this year with her track \\"Baby I'm a fool\\" from her 2nd album \\"My One And Only Thrill\\".... I loved that album so much that I had to buy this one too, this is her debut.    And it is a confident and convincing jazz debut I must say. I'm not a major jazz fan but this girl has captured my attention. She is more convincing than say Norah Jones at jazz for me and she is not as showy and glossy as say Michael Buble who I have to say I have sadly tired of... can't get into his new album much at all.      Melody has a really soulful voice and it is clear this style of music is perfect for her... she evokes a smoky jazz club feel on this album and her 2nd one too. It's so soulful and sincere... it's not about over-complex arrangements, it's about her selling the lyrics to you ... she sings it like she means it... really effective.     Maybe, too laid back and  slow for some people's tastes.... She never goes for big band style numbers... yet for me, her arrangements are simple yet beautiful.  This is why I kinda lost interest in Buble... it's all a little too showy now... this lady just sings her heart out without any major bells and whistles.     The album is full of laid back tracks that you can just lay back and relax too... not an album that you are going to get ready for a night out to but... just because it lacks up-tempo numbers doesn't mean it is really lacking at all... an album for a quiet night in or contemplative moods.     Personal faves of mine: the beautiful Love Me Like A River Does, the lilting Sweet Memory , the soulful Worrisome Heart  and the charming goodnite.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|First off, let me say don't buy these pieces of plastic unless your fingers ACTUALLY do slip off the R2 and L2 buttons OR you want a more comfortable racing experience.  These also make the L2 and R2 triggers more \\"fun\\" to press. (I think that is what this company was mostly going for!)  These don't affect first person gameplay unless you make R2 the fire button. (All of the games I've played use R1 as fire button.)  If you yearn for 360 controller-style shooting you might want to buy these.  \\"gain a competitive advantage over your oppenents\\" For one, opponents is spelled wrong in the description; and two, there is no significant advantage to using these. I find these were mostly made for comfort.  These can't cost more than a dollar to make. This is a total rip off and everyone knows it.  These are removable in case you were wondering.  Both pieces of plastic are exactly the same, so you can have one trigger without the plastic and one with the plastic.    I played through Uncharted 2 with these and they did make throwing grenades and reloading (L2 and R2) much more fun to do.  I advise NOT to buy these unless you REALLY have the situations described in the first sentence of this review.  I think it is better if you don't know how these feel so you don't feel tempted to buy these.    The star criteria need to be changed for this review. I'm not rating a game.

Now she's an artist and she's worked at this in the studio with her headphones on. Now she's not just the lady who took care of her mom. Now her mom's in Heaven saying, Toldja you could do it. The selections on the album are perfect for her and for me and for the season and for the first album. I am just so glad I bought it.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|The movie looks good and sounds good. It is fast paced from beginning to end. Yes, it won't likely win the actors any Oscars, but who was really expecting that kind of movie here anyways. I love the Dark Night and other serious adeptations of old comics/cartoons but there is still room for some over the top explosions and a plot with no real basis in reality. In fact having a 5 year old of my own and getting him the old cartoon series (which in my memory I held in very high esteem), I can safely say that it wasn't filled with a lot of believabilty, plot lines, or great voice acting. In fact the plots were often cheesy as was the sexual tension between some of the male and female characters. Ditto for the movie.  And if I am somewhat disappointed in the movie it is only in that the violence is a little bit much for the crowd they are marketing all those toys to. As an adult, I was OK with it and thought it fit what I wanted but as a parent watching it with my son I thought it was a bit much (the old cartoons were kid of like McGyver and the A-team in that about 10,000 rounds were expelled per episode yet no one on either side died). If you are a purist I think that would be about your only gripe as the rest of the movie I think nails the old cartoon. So sit back and watch stuff blow up for two hours, no harm in that.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this CD--simply wonderful!  Wild Horses was meant to be sung this way by Susan--touched the core of my soul completely!! --For her first CD--I think it showcases the wide range of her voice and shows the entire world that she is not a \\"fad\\" -- I believe she has a long career ahead of her -- I can definitely see her in a Broadway show ---  I just hope that she is being managed in the right way and that she is happy with whatever path she takes.
1416914285|4.0|City of Bones by Cassandra Clare (Mortal Instruments Book 1)  496 pages; McElderry Books; March 26, 2007    When one writes a review--and by 'one' I mean 'me'--one is never sure what to write about. Do I concentrate on whether I enjoyed this book or on its literary worth? All the reviews I've done so far have about equal amounts of both, and this one...well, just read the review.    ENJOYMENT  I really, really enjoyed City of Bones. Let's start off by saying that. I'm not big on fantasy, and yet, after having this book reccomended to me by several people, I decided, what the heck, let's give it a try.    And so I did.    There's a lot of stuff going on in this 485-page book about a girl named Clary Fray who witnesses an unusual murder, blah, if you want to know what it's about, go read a summary or something. Clare gives us a lot of stuff to digest in the first hundred-fifty-or-so pages, and less dedicated readers may drown in the hefty character list. Still, this was a fun, quick read (I think it took me, like, 3 days to read, and considering it's 485 pages...), and I think that fantasy fans especially will enjoy it, and probably its two sequels as well.    E RATING:   LITERARY WORTH *spoilers!*    It was crap.    Okay, that's not true. It wasn't crap. But there's a lot of stuff that's wrong with the book as far as LW goes. Bear with me here--if you absolutely adore this series and will kill anyone who says that it's even close to bad, don't read on. At all.    The major problem I had with this book was the description. There was a lot of it. A LOT OF IT. Clare doesn't seem to know where to stop. I mean, do we have to know what EVERYONE is wearing? Seriously.    Also, there's the fact that the secondary characters--that is, anyone who's not Clary, Isabelle, Alec, Simon, or Jace, which is, like, a lot of people--are immensely hard to care about. I found myself thinking, when Clary's mother hadn't been saved by the end of the book, \\"And I'm supposed to care?\\" I didn't--because Jocelyn had appeared only for a short while at the start of the book, during which time she acted generally unsympathetic, and what we learn about her during the book isn't exactly flattering. The only reason I did care, a little, (contradictory, I know), was because Clary did, and say what you--okay, I--will about the secondary characters, I honestly did care about what happened to Clary.    That being said, Jace was an ass. A witty ass, but an ass nonetheless. I find in fantasy today, male protagonists are quitem commonly asses. He was okay, though I wouldn't have minded if he'd died. (Only half-kidding.)    LW RATING: 2.75-3.25    City of Bones was extremely enthralling, gripping, et cetera, but it wasn't the most well-written or Printz-worthy book ever--far from it. Still, ya gotta love a book that seamlessly melds pop culture and fantasy.    OVERALL RATING: 3.50~4    (WARNING: I've been reading the second book for a while. So far IT'S EXTREMELY BORING. Will probably get better...but who knows?)
B001FB55I0|5.0|(**Contains minor spoilers**)<br /><br />First off, this is not Arnold's Terminator. If you're expecting the same thing as the first three, you'll be disappointed by this movie. Nor is it a serious philosophical work. It is simply a continuation of the first three, from a somewhat different -- but not contradictory -- light.<br /><br />The story follows John Connor and Marucs Wright, two very different individuals whose fates nonetheless seem intertwined. Connor leads a raid against one of Skynet's prisoner-holding facilities; in the process, many die. Connor makes it out alive, but so does someone else...Wright, who was being held in the facility, emerges a few minutes after Connor is extricated. Thus begins a long, twisted path on which both men embark. Along the way, they find themselves on the same team -- often doubting the other's intentions -- and yet at odds when the dark secret of Wright's resurrection -- after his execution before Judgment Day -- comes to light.<br /><br />Meanwhile, they learn that Skynet is using them both to ensnare Connor as well as Kyle Reese, in order to manipulate history in their own favor; at the same time, Skynet is manipulating the Resistance itself, offering up a sort of \\"Trojan Horse\\" in order to take out high command.<br /><br />There are many twists and turns along the rocky road to \\"Salvation\\" -- personal, and of the Resistance -- but both men make the journey. In the end, one will sacrifice all to give the other a chance at life.<br /><br />Now, aside from my brief retelling (trying not to give away too much), my opinion. It's very well done, and highly enjoyable, to me at least. Obviously, there are many who disagree. But I enjoyed the twists and turns, and actually saw the movie several times while it was playing at my local theater. Would I recommend seeing it before you buy it? Yes, if for no other reason because so many are so disappointed in it. I, however, think it is one of the best, if not the best, in the series -- certainly better than 2 and 3 imho. Keep in mind that my parents were from the generation that saw and loved the first two in theaters, and I'm not; and, frankly, I don't know how much my Dad -- who loved the first -- would care for this one. I approach this having seen the first two around when T3 (which I wasn't terribly fond of) came out.<br /><br />Also, this is best seen more than once to make certain that you catch everything; for a \\"light\\" movie (which it certainly is), it tends to jump about, and make sudden detours. Not unpleasantly, to me at least, but there it is. My advice? See it with an open mind, and don't expect a masterpiece. If you do, you might like it; I personally thought it was awesome..

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I really liked this movie, and despite its emotional ending I was somewhat disappointed to find out that the man was a liar all along.  Okay, the few final scenes may be open to interpretation, but I still say the guy's a liar.  Of course, most people probably know that before they even open the DVD box, but I've always been quite gullible.<br /><br />But the more I thought about it, the more I thought that we all have tall tales to tell about ourselves.  I mean, I've had a cat that could sleep with his eyes open, I've had a job where I cremated people, I once drove home and saw part of a miniature golf course lying on my neighbor's lawn, I've beaten a multi time world champion powerlifter in an official meet, and I once arm wrestled a guy who survived the concentration camps of the holocaust.  All of these statements are true, but I'm leaving out a lot of information regarding each one on purpose.  I guess knowing what not to say is an important part of storytelling too.<br /><br />The music in the film is perfect.  Perfect.  The tall tales are pretty good at bordering reality and fantasy just right, although there are one or two instances where they cut clear into fantasy completely.<br /><br />Big Fish may not have the originality of The Neverending Story, but it certainly has a lot of charm.  The Alabama setting adds a lot to the atmosphere.  The title fits in perfectly with the symbolism and themes.  I don't recall the use of any bad language.  It's probably the closest thing to a George MacDonald story you'll find on film.<br /><br />(12/12/09 - actually, I do remember some slightly bad language from Devito, and the kids visiting the witch house)
B00006AFF5|5.0|Director Ron Howard's film version of the classic 1966 TV Holiday cartoon \\"How The Grinch Stole Christmas\\" is an entertaining and well-crafted adaption of a Christmas classic. Jim Carrey plays the Grinch who decides he is going to steal Christmas from the Whos who live in a town called Whoville. The neat thing about the film is that they actually delve into the Grinch's past and examine why he is the way he is, being unhappy and full of hate. The special effects and the make-up are amazing and the muscical score is breathtaking. Faith Hill does the beautiful theme song called \\"Where Are You Christmas?\\" which has now become a beloved Holiday classic. The DVD comes with many bonuses including deleted scenes, video of Fiath Hill's song, trailer, visual effects, makeup application and design, and much more. Grossing more than $260 million at the boxoffice, \\"How The grinch Stole Christmas\\" spent four weeks at the top of the boxoffice charts, although some critics hated it. Don't forget that the original Boris Karloff cartoon from the sixties is also available on DVD with a bunch of special features.

B002T45VX6|5.0|Not like any of her other CDs, this one is certainly more \\"pop\\".  But ya know what?  It's infectious and fun and the lyrics are as great as ever.  Rolling Stone gives it the best review of any of her CDs (4 of 5 stars) to date, and I have to agree.  And at this price, what's not to love?
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I totally loved this movie. I´m not a trekkie, just a sci-fi lover, and I enjoyed all the action sequences and all the VFX shots. The story is very good, also.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I love her voice and her performance is great.  However, the choice of songs is perplexing.  Definitely not what I expected.
0385504225|3.0|I waited extremely impatiently for this book to be released, and when it was, I devoured it. It is typical Brown in that is is a super fast, enjoyable read. It is atypical in that it did not intellectually stimulate the way the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons did. Not only that, it actually seemed very repetitive and even a little (gasp) boring at times (for Dan Brown, that is). However, even with the predictable ending and the rather flat story line, it was still a fun read. Just don't go thinking you are getting into the next Angels and Demons or anything...    Hoping that the next time I can give Mr. Brown a 5 star review!
B0029NY9YO|5.0|I could start out with the line from Dave Mason's classic song:  \\"There are no good guys, there are no bad guys, there's only you and me and we just disagree.\\"<br /><br />Most superhero movies deal with people who are basically moral and upright, where the villains are usually evil, and where the focus is on PG-13 rated action.  This movie blurs the distinction between good and evil, where the heroes are no less violent (and in some cases no less murderous) than the villains.  The result in fairly nihlistic, that there is really no meaning to everything.  In another sense, it is existential, where we create our own meaning.<br /><br />I am giving this five stars.  Why?  Because it is a well crafted story.  It gives you opportunity to know the characters psychologically rather than the typical two dimensional stereotypes where the emphasis is on the action instead of on the person.  (The recent Batman series comes closest to this, with honorable mention to the X-Men Trilogy.)  It is a long movie, but that's because it doesn't rush the story.<br /><br />There were many reasons I could have given it a lower rating.  Some are purely subjective, such as the dark and bleak outlook of the movie.  Some are due to feeling this being an R-Rated movie with a lot of vile language, too graphic violence, and going all out on the nude scene with Night Owl II and Silk Spectre II-- a lot of that seeming gratituous.<br /><br />This is, as just said, an R-Rated movie.  Teenagers don't need to see this movie.  Personally, I think they don't need to be exposed to that hopeless a philosophy any more than to the sex and violence.  In other words, I long for the days of the Batman TV series.  But maybe Silk Spectre I was right -- the future looks darker and the past looks brighter.  I just would like to do more to brighten the future.

B0026P3G12|4.0|NPR did a piece on Sarah Boyle and Adam Lambert, two reality contestants who will are owning CD sales right now and are positioned to have the top 2 albums of 2009. The smirkingly snide tone of the NPR reviewers had more than a hint of truth: Sarah Boyles' arrangements are big, and it represents, as they said, schmultzy material that Patti Page would have done in the 1950s. But people bought a lot of that schmultz, and this weekend, so did I. Know what? Whether people are buying this (Amazon's #1 downloaded album right now) for the novelty, or the voice, it is a good album. Covers of the Stones' WILD HORSES and the Monkees' DAYDREAM BELIEVER (lyrics are different from my memory of them) are slowed down and an homage to tunes that suddenly sound much, much better. A couple of churchy numbers are very good but don't expect non-christians to shed a tear over AMAZING GRACE or SILENT NIGHT. CRY ME A RIVER has been rebirthed by Joe Cocker decades ago, but a slow-cooked Boyle version weighs in along side any 50s version I know. Your grandmother will like it, your aunt will like it, and good gosh, WE really like Sarah Boyle's pipes.<br /><br />WE are indifferent to most pop idols who dance too much and lip sync even more. I don't know Rhianna, and don't care about most of the packaged divas of the day. We do have Julie London on CD, and more Dean Martin albums are selling today, for whatever reasons one can claim to dig, because in part, they are lush, slick, cultured icons with something that today's trash don't have: classy, controlled voices. Susan Boyle's I DREAMED A DREAM can be called a lot of things, but not bad things. And smirks are pretty good barometers for what people are buying. Another talent who got bashed and flipped off, Taylor Swift, is a kid who can really write and perform and sells very well. Swift, like Lambert and Boyle took the punches and built a bigger following. In 2010, to be a hit, you really have to deliver, and for a bargain bin's worth of sound-alike garbage, unique is good and uniquely talented is the big winner. Susan Boyle's first CD is just that: big, big sound that will compliment your Bose system.<br /><br />And OK, NPR, there are thousands, as you said, of mezzo sopranos out there who could do this and do it just as well if not better, but they didn't. They could, and we're buying.<br /><br />Ms. Boyle and Bruce Springsteen have the same publicist, I've heard, and whoever it is, this is good work in hyping an obscure voice without pretensions. Sarah Boyle may not last, but unlike other reality popsters, she has a magnificent voice that is worthy of tremendous respect. If Sarah can relaunch easy listening and massively produced music that anyone can understand the lyrics to, wow, paraphrasing Frank Zappa, \\"Hit it, Zubin!\\"e garbage, unique is good and uniquely talented is the big winner.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|This is where it all began. Star Trek launched science fiction film into a new era. It had many selling points. The stories and plots  were intelligent and thought provoling. Laced with enough action/adventure to keep it from ploding. A great combination for good  entertainment. It also projected the future as a bright, hopeful place. Something that was really needed in the hippie/drug infested  1960s. It also treated science fiction as a serious entertainment subject instead of goofy 90% fantasy like it normally was in  those days, and still is today all too often.  Star Trek became the benchmark by which good science fiction in film was measured. And still is today. Still the original and best  of the lot.  Some complain that the acting was not that good, and in some cases it wasn`t. But it was no worse than acting in general in tv shows  of the time, or today for that matter. They may also complain that the special effects were not very good. But this isn`t the case.  Remember that this was the mid 60s. For the time, they were pretty good. Especially considering the low tv budget they had to work  with.  As far as space opera in tv, it has never been matched. Which is a real shame. It shouldn`t be that difficult. But tv in generally  has been on a downhill slide since the 70s.
B00005R62K|4.0|Stained Class being Judas Priest's 4th studio album and their 1978 release is the first album with Les Binks playing the drums. The booklet contains well-written liner-notes by the band and all the lyrics including three photographs of the band from the time of the recording of the album. We also get two extra tracks one which was during the early years of the band and one recorded during one of their many world tours. The sound is very raw and the lyrics are well-written. Allmusic gives the album 4.5/5 and this is right but since 5 is a little to high and I can not give half points it gets 4/5. 4/5.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has such a beautiful voice. Her peaceful voice is still filled with passion. I was surprised at some of the songs here but it must be the real Susan. She promised her mother she would \\"be someone\\" and she certainly has become one! God Bless her.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Death Magnetic being Metallica's 2008 release and their 9th studio album is an album that sounds alot like their earlier recordings, i.e., ....And Justice for All. The tracks range between 5 to 10 minutes and is not the radio friendly tracks that one found on recordings such as One and Load. To me this is Metallica going back to basics and this includes well-written lyrics, heavier guitar riffs and a more macho rough sound then one had heard from the band in quite some time. The booklet contains all the lyrics but for some strange reason the artwork is covering up some of the lyrics. Allmusic, Blender and IGN all gave this release high marks in their reviews. The album topped several charts around world, e.g., France, Sweden and Croatia. 4/5.
B00006DEFA|4.0|Amadeus featured amazing performances by the actors, great costumes and wonderful writing, not to mention beautifully integrated music supporting and enlarging the action of the film... but the director was clearly in love with the complexities he went through in recreating Mozart's operatic performances. This \\"director's cut\\" version included a disproportionate amount of opera performance, which in my view did little to enlarge or enhance the viewer's understanding of Mozart's musical genius.     You're better off with the movie cut as it originally appeared in theatres. Much tighter, more concentrated, and a proper balance of music and story line.
B000001FKY|4.0|Hysteria being Def Leppard's 1987 release and their 4th studio album is a prime example of 80's Hard Rock music. The booklet contains no lyrics  but a list of whom plays what. The album was a massive commercial success when it was released and topped the charts on the Billboard 200, UK Top 40 and the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. To me this is not heavy metal but rock with metal elements to it being that I am used to listen to groups like Megadeath and Metallica. One could even say that it sounds a bit like glam rock or glam metal since it definitely has glam rock elements to it. Tracks that standout are \\"Love Bites\\", \\"Pour Some Sugare On Me\\" and \\"Armageddon It\\". The critics loved the recording and Allmusic and Rolling Stone both gave it high marks. 4/5.
B002QEXN2K|1.0|As a long time John Mayer fan and a fellow musician, I have to say this album is a disaster.  I have loved all of his other albums, but this one is nothing like them.  He seems to be experimenting with a different sound-one which is not working for him.  Some of the songs are very 80's sounding.  His rendition of crossroads is terrible; I'm sure Robert Johnson is turning over in his grave.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|United Abominations being Megadeath's 2007 release and their 11th studio album and is great mix of heavy metal and thrash metal. Mustaine has written some very political lyrics and usually I have an aversion to political music but Mustaine writes with plenty of wit and intelligence so that the lyrics do not sound basic or like propaganda. The album was met by many positive reviews. Kerrang!, IGN and  Blabbermouth all gave it 4/5 which I also give it. All the lyrics are included in the booklet including a list of whom plays what including the brand names of the instruments which is quite rare. The artwork is ok but a little busy. The photograph of the band is very nice. 4/5.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have waited for this CD since first hearing Susan Boyle sing.......as all of us have.  Waited and wondered...and I must tell you....I am absolutely amazed and thrilled at how beautiful her voice is. Every song on this CD is done so beautifully, it will bring tears to your eyes and give you chills.  If it doesn't, then you have been listening way to much to high tech, computerized music and have forgotten how beautiful it is to listen to someone singing without all of that.  Get this CD.....you will not be disappointed. Listen to it carefully, quietly. Listen to the beauty and meaning of each song and Susan Boyle's overwhelmingly beautiful voice.....if you don't have a tear in your eye.....or goose bumps when it is over..........you have lost your soul....!!!
B001I5M9SC|5.0|As a great fan of Andrea, I have to admit that was I let down by his work, on the contrary I have all his discs and dvds.

0439023483|5.0|Where do I start? Well, When I first read the synopsis of this book, I immediately thought of the Japanese move Battle Royale. The idea of teenagers being put into a fight to the death was the same, so I put off reading it for a long time. Big mistake. I can't believe I deprived myself of this book! The characters were very well developed and believable. There is action, violence, and a little romance. The book works as a standalone, and doesn't feel like it needs a sequel although it's the first in a trilogy. As soon as I finished, I HAD to go out and buy book two, Catching Fire. It's probably best to read them back to back, because the second one picks up right where book one left off. Buy this book! There is a movie planned for release in late 2010, so read it now so you're ahead of the game!
B002X02V02|3.0|When i first heard the fame the entire way through. I truly thought it was one of the best, if not the best pop cd's this decade. It had such a hard dance edge to it, I thought nobody else could ever match up to this groundbreaking record. The songs were hot hot hot! And she def. gave everybody else a run for their money,even Madonna imo. So i was def, excited that she announced that she would be releasing a new EP. I was a little disappointed by some of the tracks that i heard! Alejandro was ok. I mean it seemed really corny to me, and the grooves weren't as powerful as some of her other stuff.At least she doesn't disappoint with Bad Romance, what a great dance type song.To me she's really stretching and experimenting with what she can do.The opera part was pretty neat. That has to be my 2nd favorite track on the album. Speechless was a big surprise and had to be my favorite track on the album! What a talented ad beautiful singer. After listening to that track,i think she'll be around for a while. It seems like a great cover of classic rock song,but i cant seem to think of the song. It def. was gaga at a deep and more mature level. I almost enjoy this side as much as her dance electronic music. Monster was so-so,seemed like a throw away track from the fame. the only other two songs i liked were telephone with beyonce that was pretty unique and edgy, and teeth. Teeth seemed more like a song the gossip or the killers might do. I really thought that was a great way to close off this album! Overall, this is not as good as her first album,but its still got a few really good tracks on it. I would only buy bad romance, telephone, speechless if it were me!
B002OR18HQ|5.0|I did not go to this concert simply because while living close by in London, I had seen Fogerty several times on each of his recent UK tours including Wembley Arena with my family preceding this event, so could not justify it to myself. Then seeing the subsequent internet entries via Wikipedia criticising how the concert had been handled given it was to be filmed (as covered at length in another review here) I counted my lucky starts that I did not. However with its final release in edited form all that can be thankfully ignored and forgotten as this DVD is quite possibbly John Fogerty's greatest live recording and is definitely I believe the one to get, just pipping the 1998 release \\"Premonition\\".    The reasons are that firstly this is a masterpiece of audio recording (remembering the cavernous Albert Hall by design is more suited to classical than rock music concerts) and film editing, compared with all prior Fogerty DVDs and the now very outdated few Creedence film recordings especially the original Albert Hall concert. Having viewed the Stones/Scorsese \\"Shine a light\\" effort just before this DVD, you realise that director and editor Michael Darren with probably a much lower budget and less technical effects than Martin Scorsese has achieved much more in conveying the spirit of rock'n'roll. The standards on show here are exemplary and while you inevitably get odd shots of hand held camera crews scurrying around stage they do not mar the sheer energy and enjoyment that are well communicated throughout.    Fogerty is certainly in fine voice on all songs with great lead guitar playing as always and because of the stage lighting and layout for filming, his regular band are more easily seen plus participate better than on all prior Fogerty DVDs. The inclusion of a back up chorus on appropriate songs and a talented multi instrumentalist Jason Mowery to play on certain songs help take this event as was the case with \\"Premonition\\", even further out of the more standardFogerty and backing group live rock concert recording.    Add to this that the Fogerty song repertoire in the final cut drops standard concert favourites (\\"Green River\\" & \\"Have you seen the Rain\\") to include some lesser performed but great songs by the man (\\"Almost Saturday Night\\" & \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\") plus some very well handled country numbers (\\"Southern Streamline\\" and Blue Ridge Mountain Blues\\" shine especially) and the man by the end of the 1 hour 40 minutes recording simply amazes on all counts given he is now well into his sixties.    While I started this review with a comment on the pre-release noise around the original June 2008 concert, there is one interesting historical facet on show here. When Creedence made their original Albert Hall appearance they closed with \\"Keep on chooglin'\\"and despite a tumultuous reception refused to do any encores. In this set the song is performed at mid point (as is now common in Fogerty's live set) in a shortened version. Fogerty instead does a storming 3 song encore of \\"Travellin' Band\\", \\"Rockin' all over the world\\" and \\"Proud Mary\\" to finish off the set in grand style. John makes reference in the film and in the sleeve notes to the DVD that he has been through some dark times in his mid-life. If any evidence were needed that the man is now at the top of his game this fact together with the full DVD provides it in loads!
B002X20W2E|5.0|I'm usually not a big Rihanna fan,and quite frankly she's been more popular with 12 y.o. then the college crowd. But she keeps making the hits and like Miley Cyrus, has proven to be quite sustainable and sometimes enjoyable. I liked SOS when it came out when i was in high school, and i thought umbrella and don't stop the music were somewhat enjoyable tracks. I was awaiting this album, because let's face it. Behind Britney and Beyonce,she's probably the highest ranking pop star of the past few years. I knew that she would probably do the Madonna and Britney route and try to do a S&M,dark theme type album and boy was i right. I actually really enjoyed this cd all the way through. I thought that she's improved as a singer and quite frankly just won me over as a fan. I thought Russian Roulette was a chilling ballad, love the vocal work.Wait your Turn was a bangin way to open up an album. Rock Star 101 was a awesome and enjoyable track as well. I was surprised at how catchy G4L was! I assumed it would  just be filler, but towards the end of the album it got more enjoyable for me.Te Amo was a beautifully written track and wasn't as cliche as i thought it was going to be. Hard the second single from the album,was my least favorite track but it was catchy and it could be a hit.This album def. won me over as a fan. It's a shame it wont be as big as her last album,due to all the new releases coming out this week! This album is a most have! She's got a harder edge and left all that kiddie stuff behind Really matured as a artist.
B0029O08WA|1.0|I listened to this while driving with my sister since she bought the cd.  She introduced me to the Twilight soundtrack as well on another trip. After listening to the Twilight soundtrack, I immediately went to Walmart and bought it. With this one, we were so excited to start it up, but a bit disappointed with how it ended up. Now I am totally not familiar with music, at all. Just about the only modern music I listen to comes from soundtracks. For example, I have all the Scrubs soundtracks and a House one too. Mostly I listen to oldies though, think 20s-40s.  So I am totally unfamiliar with any arists from either soundtracks, they could all be indie for all I know. I really liked the variety on that soundtrack and was blown away with how much I enjoyed the music. The music on this soundtrack isn't catchy, doesn't flow, doesn't make you want to move.  Several songs from the Twilight soundtrack are still on my running playlist a year later and I'm not bored with them.      I don't look to music to be deep and make me think. Ditto for literature, I may have a degree in English and be fully capable of analyzing lit, but I have no desire to do so. I want music to make me smile at times, cry at times, evoke some sort of emotion and be something I want to listen to. I force myself to do enough things, exercise, eat right, not buy that totally awesome lcd tv.... I don't want to force myself to listen to boring and depressing music that all seems the same. There's little variety here.
B002WLTI62|5.0|I've aways been a shakira fan! She makes great music that upbeat and catchy. It's also nice to hear some latin influenced music on the radio.I was realy skeptical when she decided like everybody to essentially copy this new dance craze in the music industry, but surprisingly most of this album is very good. If you want to hear old shakira just listen to Gypsy that reminds me of most of her other work.I also enjoyed She wolf, that song was basically a smash thanks to the hot sexy video.I really liked the way she mixes in vocals with the disco beats. Give it up to me, at first seemed like a rip off of madonnas give it to me,featuring a rapper as well. But this one totally kicks that one in the pan. This funky, unique and has great instruments in the back ground. She did a great job on the AMAS of performing this song. Spyglass had to be my favorite song. I love the chilling horns part. Its got a great beat and the lyrics are pretty sexy and seductive. Def. dance pop with an edge. Did it again was the only filler track was like,ugh! But it was still alot better then i thought. Why wait was another bangin track as well.I enjoyed this way better then lady gagas latest album. Im not saying that sucked by any means, but this one had better production quality,imo. Which is what i like to hear in dance music.This is a must have! great album!

And that can be either good or bad, depending in your sensibilities.  Many critics seem to have been thoroughly divided by this film.<br /><br />But everywhere I go, I seem to hear nothing but good things about it from friends and strangers alike.  I have to agree with them; I think this movie has more good things than bad.  It is a mesmerizing story with lots of memorable moments (both funny and dramatic), and it is well-developed.  It has some interesting thought-provoking content, including some comments and themes about consumerism and capitalism.  With a seemingly nonsensical twist toward the end, the plot makes sense in its own way (and seems really sublime on repeated viewings).  Characters are strong; the narrative is very interesting and there are a lot of memorable lines.  Acting and writing are excellent.  There are some interesting special effects, most of which hold up to this day.  Photography is solid, and the editing style is interesting.  It all works together to create some distinctive imagery.  Production design (sets, props, costumes, sets) is excellent.  Music is really interesting (performed by the Dust Brothers).<br /><br />This disc has awesome quality.  The picture is very sharp and detailed, with excellent color and contrast.  There is a fine layer of film grain; it is noticeable and noisy in some scenes, but detracts very little from the image overall.  Sound quality is excellent (DTS-HD MA 5.1), with a few of the more exciting scenes being really loud and the rest of the movie being clear and solid.  This disc includes lots of extras, including a few commentaries, some featurettes and deleted scenes ported over from the old DVD release, and a couple of new features (some awards footage and something that lets you fiddle around with the sound mixing on select scenes).  My copy came with a cool slipcover that can fold open.<br /><br />There is also a nice little gag with the menu screen.

B001AVCFK6|1.0|Just received the new Start Trek on BluRay from Amazon.  I do not have a BluRay player yet, nevertheless bought the BluRay version  BECAUSE it promised a digital copy I could play on my computer.    The third disc (with the digital copy) states, \\"You must upgrade security components...  Step 1: Click here to get the security upgrade.\\"  When I do, I'm taken to [...]  where the button for the upgrade is grayed out?!?!?    Turning to the printed instructions that came with the movie; I see, in the fine print of course,  \\"...For more information, technical support and minimum requirements please visit [...] copy\\"  When I do that I get a blank, worthless page!    Furthermore, the printed instructions also state, \\"For transfer to PC...  Step One: Insert the digital copy disc into your PC.  Step Two: Choose Transfer digital copy.  But when I insert the digital copy disc, what comes up on the screen is  a window telling me, \\"To get a Digital Copy of this movie please insert this  disc into your computer's DVD-ROM or BD-ROM drive.\\"  And what's with the 'Return' Button?!  First of all, it, along with the entire screen area does not react to a mouse click at all,  and second, 'Return' to what?!    I realize all this new technology is very complicated, there are compatibility issues, etc.;  but when Paramont charges the kind of prices they do for DVD's and BluRays;  then provides such a sequence of failures and just plain stupid instruction  windows, one has to wonder about their competence, among other things.    I'm very curious as to whether others have had a similar experience.  This is the first time I've bought a movie on disc that offered the \\"digital copy\\"  and at this point I have no intention of making that mistake again until Paramont,  and whoever else, works out the bugs!

B00008GKEG|4.0|If you're a hard-core Beatles fan, I suppose you have to have this.  It's a loosely-structured, dirty-laundry free hagiography of the Beatles.  Typically what you're getting is a voiceover from some interview over a still photography (or sometimes footage), while the music plays in the background.<br /><br />The reason this ain't gettin' 5 stars from me is that, while your mouse-cursor might be hovering over that \\"Add to Cart\\" button, you should know this:  an unacceptable amount of these 5 disks is filler.  What I mean is Beatles songs playing over still footage, or archival film footage -- something you tire of quickly and can get many other places anyhow.  In other words, there is a lot less that is truly excellent and good to this 5-disc series than it appears at first.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga is genious and can back it up with talent, which very few pop stars can claim these days. She also adds artistry back into a very bland and boring scene of talentless media whores. She has an uncanny knack for blending togther multiple genres of music together and somehow produces a catchy and fun tune.
B002T9H2LK|3.0|Just for those thinking it's sacrilegious for Mr. Tarantino to have invented a alternative, B-movie version of WWII history, I say go fly a kite.<br /><br />In fact, I wish Mr. Tarantino would make several more such movies, playing fast and loose with various periods of history until we get it through our heads that doing this opens up creative avenues of insight and adventures that we currently deny ourselves.  Authors in previous ages certainly wouldn't have scrupled.<br /><br />But the thing seems thematically uneven to be considered great.  From what I read, Tarantino took 10 years to write this, and it shows.  They say you shouldn't take that long to write something, because there are too many changes in the author himself during such a time.  Thus what you finally come up with is likely to be stylistically and thematically clunky.  (Think of Moby-Dick:  unfortunate that the author went through so many changes while writing that.)<br /><br />It's like Tarantino was at times trying to do this, at other times trying to do that.  In the end we get something that doesn't cohere stylistically and is only intermittently entertaining.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's first album (and I am sure with many to follow) is a stunning example of pure talent.  Her voice is perfect.  Her style has been formed by her 40+ years of life experience - pain, harship, success and joy.  She apparently can sing just about any type of adult music with ease: from Broadway to inspirational to pop.      The album has been well produced with a huge orchestral backgound or just a piano to showcase her crystal bell like voice.  In an world where some artists take a year to put together an album, it was apparently put together relatively fast: a few months.  No matter how long it took, it is fantastic.    Her signature song, \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" is amazing. It starts small and builds until it explodes with her realization of her dream.    Susan's rendition of \\"Cry Me A River\\" is unlike any other I have heard.  Johhny Mercer apparently wrote this for her.  (Yes I know he has been dead for decades.)    She has taken \\"Day Dream Believer\\" to an new intamate level. Yes it is missing Davy Jones and a pop, background which I do love but her version is fresh and exciting.    Enough said.  There are 9 other incredably well sung songs you need to hear for yourself. Buy this CD.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is the greatest mix of Beatles music so far. It is so well mixed you can hear each instrument and voice distinctly from each other, at least most of the time. This is amazing considering that the original music was recorded on 4 tracks at the most. I have had the Beatles on 45, LP, cassette (maybe 8 track) DVD and two versions of CD. You have got to get these CDs. This is what John Lennon wanted all along. It is a shame he isn't alive to hear it.

B0026M87G4|5.0|Hours... is a lush, largely serene self-portrait through which David Bowie atones for mistakes and reflects on regrets. Not that this is the chameleon's swan song, but it's a fitting time for him to speak out honestly about his life--a life that's been lionized, criticized, and mythologized by the masses for three decades. Bowie's Hunky Dory muses were once \\"driving their mamas and papas insane,\\" but here they are aged and faded (\\"The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell\\"); yet the man himself could not be more graceful or vibrant.<br /><br />Track Listing:<br />.<br />1. Thursday's Child<br />2. Something in the Air<br />3. Survive<br />4. If I'm Dreaming My Life<br />5. Seven<br />6. What's Really Happennig?<br />7. Pretty Things Are Going to Hell [Unedited Version] [1999 Studio Lp Version]<br />8. New Angels of Promise  [1999 Lp Version]<br />9. Brilliant Adventure [Instrumental]<br />10. Dreamers<br />.<br />With Hours... David Bowie updates his musical wardrobe, but for the first time in his career he drops the facade. The album is a real-life memoir of loss, regret, and repentance. He boldly intertwines trip-hop rhythms, new-wave nods, Reeves Gabrels's wondrously odd guitar riffs, slow, deliberate ambient tempos, and atmospheric synth accents, all while maintaining a cohesive, otherworldly pop appeal. The CD marks the completion of an ironic circle, where Bowie draws inspiration from contemporary trends borne out of a musical style he invented decades ago. Looks like Major Tom has finally found his way home, and what a gorgeous homecoming it is. Listen to this CD fully to appreciate the depth of the music and lyrics. This is the similar to the David Bowie music I grew up with during the 70s, and enjoy the most. His voice is as good as it's ever been. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is only familiar with his later works. I really like every song on the CD, there doesn't seem to be a bad one in the bunch.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|I am not a professional theater critic but I know what I like and this aint it! If I could rate it no stars I would. This was the first time EVER that I walked out of a theater and went to another movie to \\"wash the images out of my mind\\"! The documentary form was lousy to say the least. It had good potential in the story line, but turned it to a total waste of time! I am not proud to say that I stayed 3/4 of the way thru to give it a chance, but I couldnt stand it anylonger and left!

At first I listened as the songs related to Susan.  Then just listened to her sweet voice offering.  Thoroughly enjoyable..and I am going to give several cds to family at Christmas.
B002OLUPYO|5.0|While \\"Funhouse\\" doesn't quite reach the heights of P!nk's fiery comeback album \\"I'm Not Dead,\\" it still shines through with lyrical quality and rockin' power, a further testament to her seemingly unique power to dance through the seriousness and the playfulness rather like a mirror room in a funhouse.<br /><br />\\"So What\\" is the lead single, featuring catchy riffs and hooks we've come to expect from her more rock-themed anthems. It's pure fun to listen to and it's a playful poke at the pain of heartbreak. Moving on, however, the album really starts to take off with \\"Sober,\\" which is quite possibly one of the best tracks on the album as Pink takes us through the highs and lows of substance abuse and the fight to overcome it.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Believe You\\" is a slow ballad that draws most of its power from Pink's sultry vocals rather than the lyrics. This goes into \\"One Foot Wrong,\\" a strong R&B infused track that's more of a throwback to her \\"M!ssundaztood\\" days than we've heard in a while. \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" is everything that \\"I Don't Believe You\\" should have been -- it's a somewhat sad song but the catchy beat and uplifted vocals lend it great listening power.<br /><br />The album takes a sharp upswing in tone with \\"Bad Influence,\\" a sheer fun romp through a party in Pink's mansion, displaying all of her trademark attitude. This is followed up by the title track, \\"Funhouse,\\" which is an absolutely amazing -- if nonsensical -- break-up theme: \\"This used to be a funhouse/But now it's full of evil clowns/It's time to start the countdown/I'm gonna burn it down,\\" she sings gleefully as she contemplates arson on her broken relationship.<br /><br />\\"Crystal Ball\\" is an acoustic ballad that's stunning to listen to and draws rich and lush metaphors about life and love will still continuing the carnival imagery, which works surprisingly well. \\"Mean\\" is entirely unexpected: a pure southern-rock anthem whose riffs sound like they'd be at home on a Skynyrd album with Pink's rocker vocals detailing love gone sour with great skill (and good punch).<br /><br />\\"It's All Your Fault\\" has a catchy beat though the lyrics are more nonsensical than meaningful. Pink masterfully saves herself by jumping into \\"Ave Mary A,\\" (in my opinion the best song on this album) which is a rock ballad decrying the evils of the world and wondering why any sort of divine presence is seemingly absent. \\"Glitter in the Air\\" is the final track, a soft piano ballad that raises many questions about life and love, ending the album on a peaceful note.<br /><br />While there are a two or three missteps, \\"Funhouse\\" is generally a fantastic album that showcases Pink's impressive range in vocals as well as genres, her ability to poke fun at herself and the world even as she mixes metaphors to ask and answer meaningful questions about life, love, and music. While it doesn't quite have the same solidity that \\"I'm Not Dead\\" had in spades, \\"Funhouse\\" is still a worthy addition to the credits under her belt.<br /><br />DELUXE TOUR EDITION<br /><br />In the Deluxe Tour Edition of \\"Funhouse,\\" we get two new tracks and a bonus DVD full of goodies, rather like the Platinum Edition set of \\"I'm Not Dead.\\"<br /><br />\\"This Is How It Goes Down\\" is the first, a hidden track that plays after a small pause at the end of \\"Glitter in the Air.\\" Featuring rapper Travis McCoy, \\"This Is How It Goes Down\\" is a rock/rap fusion that's pure fun from start to finish, rather like \\"Centerfold\\" or \\"Hooker\\" from her previous efforts. It's somewhat fluffy and not very important, but it's punchy chorus and catchy hooks that stick in a listener's head like white on rice is pure Pink.<br /><br />\\"Push You Away,\\" however, is a wonderful new track that perfectly compliments the rest of \\"Funhouse,\\" and the studio version of this song is also now available as a bonus track on her Funhouse Tour CD/DVD release. A fresh ballad, \\"Push You Away\\" rings with the same power as \\"Mean\\" or \\"Please Don't Leave Me.\\"<br/><br />The DVD is a full bag of tricks, as well, featuring all four music videos to Pink's \\"Funhouse\\" singles: \\"So What,\\" the amazingly in-your-face video of the year that featured a drunken Pink cruising down Sunset Boulevard on a lawnmower with a beer can in hand, flipping off the other drivers; \\"Sober,\\" the delightfully nonsequiter delusion that features imagery of Pink making out with herself; \\"Funhouse,\\" featuring Pink dancing gleefully in the ashes of her burned-out shell of a home surrounded by dancing clowns; and \\"Please Don't Leave Me,\\" Pink's marvellously demented take on Stephen King's \\"Misery.\\"<br /><br />The DVD also features live performances of \\"I Don't Believe You,\\" \\"Please Don't Leave Me,\\" and the ever-popular \\"So What.\\" The final goodie is a video-by-video commentary by Pink and her producers, which is fun to listen to once or twice.<br /><br />OTHER RELEASED/UNRELEASED TRACKS<br /><br />\\"Funhouse\\" had a wealth of bonus tracks that the listener can find via iTunes, Amazon, Rhapsody, or as B-sides for her singles, including: \\"Boring\\" and \\"Why Did I Ever Like You,\\" both of which are punky and punchy in-your-face rock songs; \\"Could've Had Everything,\\" featuring a catchy riff and unexpected lyrics; and the heartrending and achingly lovely acoustic ballad \\"When You're Through.\\"<br /><br />P!nk: \\"Funhouse\\" 4 1/2 out of 5 stars<br /><br />\\"Funhouse\\" Deluxe Tour Edition: 5 out of 5 starsnk's \\"Funhouse\\" singles: \\"So What,\\" the amazingly in-your-face video of the year that featured a drunken Pink cruising down Sunset Boulevard on a lawnmower with a beer can in hand, flipping off the other drivers; \\"Sober,\\" the delightfully nonsequiter delusion that features imagery of Pink making out with herself; \\"Funhouse,\\" featuring Pink dancing gleefully in the ashes of her burned-out shell of a home surrounded by dancing clowns; and \\"Please Don't Leave Me,\\" Pink's marvellously demented take on Stephen King's \\"Misery.\\"    The DVD also features live performances of \\"I Don't Believe You,\\" \\"Please Don't Leave Me,\\" and the ever-popular \\"So What.\\" The final goodie is a video-by-video commentary by Pink and her producers, which is fun to listen to once or twice.

B0026P3G12|5.0|My expectations for this CD were very high, based on the first three songs which I (along with most of the modern world) had already heard.  Those three songs, plus the others on the CD just blew me away.  Each song is so personal to her and such a part of her story that the listener almost feels as if he or she is intruding on very private ground.  Beneath the words to each song on the insert are comments in Susan's own handwriting and this only makes the message of the song clearer and deeper.  Susan has a unique gift for touching the emotions of the listener and for making each song she sings totally her own.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Appaloosa is a great movie, made in the same way as great movies like \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\". The historical accuracy is excellent. An old guy like me who has grown up watching great westerns (and some bad ones) can really appreciate the attention to detail in the set, the clothing and weapons, the tack on the horses and the acting. This is truly one of best movies to come out of Hollywood in a long time. It's also nice that this movie was made here in the US. (not that some of the ones made in Canada weren't good.) This is one DVD I will definately add to my collection.  The only thing I can say that I would like to have been different.....I would love to have been an extra!
0765348276|1.0|Okay, why do so many like this book? In the first half there is zero conflict. Zero. Finally, after all the false conflict of basic training and pages of sassy, \\"funny\\" and glib dialog about meals, having sex (imagine that!) and did I mention having sex? And while we're on the subject of sex, it's sex without meaning, sex without eroticism, sex that's just going through the motions (like the rest of the book) then we finally get to the first big battle scene and... and... Pffffffffffft goes the air out of the balloon. No one is in any real danger. It's a turkey shoot. That's where I gave up. When you can read half a book and not care if the main character lives or dies, then it's time to, as Dorothy Parker suggests, hurl the book with great force.  If you want an involving SF story, CONFLICT and maybe even a character you will care about, try any earlier Jack Vance or [[ASIN:0965840727 Sisters of Glass]].

B002K0WBXW|2.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie! I love Sandra Bullock. I can't think of a movie of hers I haven't enjoyed. I even liked \\"Miss Cong. 2 Armed & Fabulous\\". Not her best but still better than The Proposal.   The movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't very funny either. A few smiles maybe and \\"It was cute\\" at the end was about it.  Her character was unlikable (that was the point, but it didn't improve much over the course of the movie) and with such a great cast, I had hoped for better. I can't really pinpoint a bunch of negatives about the movie. I just didn't like it. Not funny, their relationship progressed painfully slowly, and you just really didn't get into the movie. All the funny scenes were in the trailers.
0553801546|5.0|This is other world fantasy at its best. Has it all; beings with psi powers, dragons, a setting in something like our middle ages, and a friendship beyond all bounds. It is an emotional roller coaster ride that makes you not want to put the book down until you finish it. The author (Robin Hobb), weaves a tale that makes  you feel you are a part of.
B000VNMMQ6|3.0|I had high hopes for this sequel based on the good reviews on Amazon. This movie disappoints. It starts out a bit slowly & the filming is that new dark, cold effect that seems to be the new way of trying to create suspense or what, I really don't know. The movie doesn't really pick up in true Die Hard fashion until later in the movie. And it's hard to take the villain vs. Mclaine seriously. The villain is a behind the scenes white collar \\"I don't want to break a nail\\" kind of guy. Yes, Bruce Willis still makes a great Mclaine and he's still tough as nails, but some of the action scenes were just too over the top to be remotely believable even to the most \\"die hard\\" Die Hard fans. ***Spoiler Alert***    I watched the unrated version. I don't know how it differs from the theater version. The following were just too much and terribly done (because the just don't work): Mclaine is driving the police car in the tunnel (the traffic jam/crash happened to leave a clear path for him to drive through) and the helicopter is shooting the hood from above, outside. The car is a half mile inside, how do you shoot straight down & shoot the car?????  Then the helicopter crashes & explodes & one of the terrorists survives (not likely) completely fine. No soot smudges from the wreckage, no injuries. As clean as when he walked out of his dressing trailer that morning. The tractor trailer fighter plane scene was terrible. The truck was smashed in the front in one scene then the next it wasn't. Keep your editing in order boys. And a fighter jet is shooting missiles at close range & can't hit the truck?? And it can maneuver under the bridge?? Then when the truck is finally hit, it's still drivable???    *****    This movie just doesn't live up to the others, but if you have a cold beer & want to just veg out & enjoy Bruce Willis kicking a**, rent it.
0099511150|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

1591396190|4.0|\\"Blue Ocean\\" is part of the everyday business vernacular, which is a sign that the book has left an impression on the larger community. It is a quick and easy read, which dissects the strategy of a few companies which managed to  \\"align innovation with utility, price, and cost positions\\". As the authors point out, most successful companies derive the majority of their profits from these \\"blue ocean\\" strategies in uncontested markets - as compared to \\"red ocean\\" markets.<br /><br />The weakness of the book is in the fact that the analysis is all done with a benefit of hindsight and bias towards successful examples.

B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|When I saw George Michael in concert in Tampa at the St. Pete Times Forum I was amazed.  He came on stage and he sang every song i really wanted to hear.  He sang every song live no lip-syncing like other pop stars today. He apologized for having a cold and he said he almost cancelled but he couldn't do that to us.  Especially since we've been waiting 18 years to see him he was so full of energy it was great.  To watch him dance around and get the crowd going and singing along to every song.  What a entertainer I am so excited to see that this DVD is finally coming out.

B000ZELISO|3.0|Warner Brothers latched on to a cash cow with the Harry Potter films.  Based on the incredibly popular books by J.K. Rowling, the series has followed the exploits of young Harry from his freshman year at Hogwarts Wizards School through his maturation into both young man and wizard, wary of his powers.  The film series has kept the same three principal actors throughout the series; they have literally grown up before our eyes.  \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is the latest installment.    We first see Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in a subway eatery, perusing a newspaper that questions whether Harry Potter is the Chosen One.  Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) mysteriously appears to enlist Harry's assistance in convincing reclusive Prof. Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), once a teacher at Hogwarts, to return.  His memories about a former student, Tom Riddle -- who grew up to become the dreaded Voldemort -- are needed to help determine how to defend against and banish the evil entity once and for all.    The film spends a lot of time on flirtations between Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) and Harry and Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright).  Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), fellow Hogwarts student, also has eyes for Ron.  These tepid romances don't really go anywhere and are tossed in out of deference to the novel and the fact that the Hogwarts trio are beginning to look pretty old not to have an interest in romance, however chaste.    As with the previous Potter films, this one is visually stunning, even though director David Yates has gone for a more somber palette.  With its combination of spectacular vistas and dazzling CGI work, \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is one of most beautiful-looking films of the year.  Though we've seen  Quidditch matches before, the one in the current film far surpasses them in terms of energy, excitement, humor, and sheer visual splendor.  It's one of the film's highlights in terms of pure exhilaration.    Mr. Radcliffe, who's spent half his life playing Harry Potter, is OK but doesn't have a heck of a lot of razzle dazzle this time around.  He's not as much fun to watch as in earlier installments.  This may have to do with the movie's darker nature, but the script does have opportunities for lighter moments that never materialize.    I was disappointed that Hermione has been relegated practically to an extra.  She interacts very little with either Harry or Ron, and plays her romantic scenes awkwardly and unconvincingly.  Mr. Grint fares better with screen time, but Ron is never involved fully in the adventure at hand.  He's there for scenes in which Ron and Harry talk about their respective infatuations, but contributes little more.  The romantic -- if you can call them that -- interludes become tedious and slow the action considerably.    Mr. Broadbent is a welcome addition to the new film.  This is an actor who effortlessly conveys the essence of whatever character he's portraying.  His Prof. Slughorn is intelligent, absentminded, guarded, mysterious, troubled, and fearful, as required.  It's fortunate that Broadbent is portraying a major character, since he commands our attention whenever he's on screen.       Many characters from the earlier films chime in with a few bits of dialogue here and there but are otherwise unnecessary to plot.  Prof. McGonagall (Maggie Smith) shows up halfway through as the voice of caution when Harry becomes increasingly involved in elaborate intrigues.  Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), filmed mostly in close-up, delivers his menacing lines with dramatic pauses you could drive a train through.  Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) pops up, only to fall asleep for most of his screen time, and Prof. Flitwick (Warwick Davis) ambles about more as set dressing than plot ingredient.    Tom Felton's Draco Malfoy has a larger role than in previous Potter films and is seen lurking in dark corners, traveling to cryptic locations, and secretly plotting.  Mr. Felton has the knack for looking evil at all times, playing his role with little dialogue and a disturbing sneer.  The actor who really makes a commanding impression is Frank Dillane as 16-year-old Tom Riddle.  Shot mostly in close-up, Mr. Dillane conveys a maturity and intelligence mixed with malevolence that comes through perfectly.  He appears in only one scene, but he's one of the best things in \\"Half-Blood Prince.\\"    The major problem with \\"Half-Blood Price\\" is that it's a transitional film, promising but not yet delivering the good stuff.  It is often ponderously talky in an attempt to keep the viewer up to speed, but memories are short.  The script assumes an awful lot of knowledge on the part of the viewer, and only a devoted reader of the books will easily recognizes nuances and foreshadowings.  I was reminded of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and how disappointed viewers were at the inconclusiveness of that \\"Star Wars\\" installment.  The same holds true for \\"Half-Blood Prince.\\"  The final scene is really a setup -- even a commercial -- for the upcoming two-part finale, \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" to be released in 2010 and 2011.  Don't expect all plot points to be tied with a neat bow.    \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\"  is far too long at two and a half hours plus.  Though it is always visually remarkable, it will likely confuse those who don't know Potter lore, chapter and verse.  For Potter fans, it will be a delight, as they will fill in the blanks left by the screenplay.
1416562605|4.0|This dry, clever novel manages to be light reading while telling a very dark story.<br /><br />The basic premise of the story is a reflection that the Indian economy depends on the honesty and subservience of a massive lower class, which values family and fears violence towards their family as retaliation for stepping out of the imaginary `chicken coup.'<br /><br />Adiga often presents his humor through imagery.  At one point, he describes getting lost in Delhi as driving through a series of grassy circles, each of which features men \\"sleeping or playing cards.\\"  Later, he describes the effects of pollution: \\"you see a row of men with black glasses and masks on their faces, as if the whole city were out on a bank heist that morning.\\"<br /><br />The author also uses some neat literary devices; at one point, \\"to relieve you of tedium, I would like to insert my own `sidebar' into the narrative of the modern entrepreneur's growth and development.\\"  Like a musician repeating a familiar chorus, he also employs recurring images, such as scenes where the servant's eyes meet his master's eyes through the reflection of the rearview mirror.

B000066NW0|5.0|I never had much interest in this musician until 2009, when she had faded in popularity a bit. There had been little buzz surrounding her at the time, but I still heard her on the radio from time to time. It was her song I'm With You that drew me in. I may not have always liked her, but I always liked that song. It prompted me to ignore my peers and just listen to her albums. I've been hooked ever since.<br /><br />I actually wouldn't consider Let Go to be a pop album. What is pop anyway? Avril has her own unique voice and style of music, which often has a sort of rock/pop/folk sound to it. I would classify her genre as Avril Lavigne. Her lyrics, while simple, convey their meaning well. They aren't all that complex, but they also aren't so complicated that no one can understand what she's trying to say.  And if you take up issue with her lyrics, just keep in mind that she was still a teenager when this album was released.<br /><br />It's true, her music isn't for everybody. She is both loved and hated by the public. I'd recommend listening to this album (or at least some of the songs) by some other means, and then if you like it, buy a copy. A lot of my favorites of hers were the songs I never heard on the radio. It's simple. If you like her music, buy this album. If you don't like it, then don't buy it. But I ask you to listen before you judge.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Avril Lavigne's third album is rather different than her previous two. In general, this album is more raucous, energetic, cocky, and has a bit of a modern pop/punk sound to it. In a word, this album is catchy. It contains her infamously popular song \\"Girlfriend,\\" which also has it's own single, music video, and has spawned versions of the song that are in languages other than English. Also, she swears more in this album. Be warned.    Fans of her first two albums may not like this one as much, since it is so different. Songs like \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" and \\"I Don't Have to Try\\" may turn some listeners off. The latter even caused someone near me listening to say, \\"little Avril has lost her mind.\\" Some may be inclined to agree, but most attribute this change in attitude to her marriage. Since she was in \\"wedded bliss\\" (as some put it), she was much more playful. I'm not quite sure how seriously some of this album should be taken, but I think it's less serious than her first two albums. In short, Let Go and Under My Skin were more serious, and The Best Damn Thing is more fun (she at least seemed to have a blast making it).    If the song \\"Girlfriend\\" annoyed you as much as it did me at first, try not to let it put you off too much. Other songs on the album, such as \\"When You're Gone,\\" \\"Innocence,\\" and the epic-sounding \\"Keep Holding On\\" should redeem some issues you may have with the album. My advice: give the album (or at least some of the songs) a listen. Some of my favorite songs of hers were the ones I never heard on the radio. If you like what you hear upon sampling it, buy the album. If you don't like it, don't buy it. It's not complicated.    Personally, I'd recommend the explicit version. If she didn't want strong language in her music, then she wouldn't have put it in. However, if you are opposed to such vulgarity, you can simply buy a censored version. But with this, you get a DVD, the content of which should provide some insight into the process she went through to make this album.
0060920432|4.0|This is one of the best books available on the subject of happiness. It offers specific and detailed instruction about options available for both improving the quality of life, and achieving greater fulfillment.    That said, it is not an easy read, and real application is required.    I recommend taking brief notes. I went to the trouble of doing this, and I find that my notes from this book have become an excellent quick reference whenever I want to remind myself of options for wise and truly fulfilling actions.    I highly recommend the book to anyone who is a serious student of life itself.    If you're looking for an easy read, you may be best served looking elsewhere.

B001VZY4M8|5.0|To the average listener, Neil Young is probably best known for his 1972 hit album Harvest and its #1 hit single, Heart Of Gold, but After The Goldrush, the record he released prior to Harvest, is arguably his best album.  Virtually every song on here is a gem and taken as a whole are representative of the many, shifting styles of Neil's work.  Rock songs like Southern Man and When You Dance are placed side by side with acoustic gems like Only Love Can Break Your Heart and the soaring Tell Me Why.  But the most effective songs on here, the achingly beautiful Birds and the haunting title track, were recorded with a simple piano arrangement which only served to highlight the lyrics.  The remastered version is as close as one can come to the original vinyl edition and well worth the price.  If you don't have this CD, buy it.  If you already have the original CD, replace it with this one.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Jason and the entire band are simply incredible on Beautiful Mess!  The CD is wonderful and the DVD is even better.  I saw him when the Gratitude Cafe Tour came to Pittsburgh, PA - 2 days before the Chicago show was filmed for this CD/DVD.  He is seriously one of the best live performers around and it's fun to relive such a great concert!  I love watching him perform \\"Fall Through Glass\\" with Bushwalla (on the DVD only).  Sunshine Song literally brought a tear to my eye the first time I heard it!  A classic, The Boy's Gone, is fantastic!
0810983915|3.0|We did not know about the \\"Wimpy\\" series until this book. This has got to be the best one, so funny and heartwarming. \\"The Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" will resonate with so many youngsters between 9 and 12, which is the recommended age. My only criticism would be that it does not challenge this age group quite enough. They are ready to explore even more complex material, at least, mine are. The best book they've received this season is Paws & Effect: The Healing Power of Dogs, which you can also find on this amazon site. By Sharon Sakson. It shows through example what can be accomplished by a human and a dog when the dog decides it's time to be of help. My kids loved it and are still telling us stories they read from it. It is an adult book but it's writing and stories are clear to this age group. \\"Wimpy\\" was kind of a dessert for them, light, fluffy and fun.

0312117337|5.0|I have used the Osho Zen cards to give readings on my television show, Telepathic TV, for 10 years (and in my private practice as well).  Over this time, many hundreds of people have asked me the name of the deck because of its beauty and the simple, yet profound, messages it conveys.  So much of the guidance in tarot comes to us through the visual symbolism and these cards really deliver on that front.  Another wonderful plus is that the book that comes along with it is insightful and enlightening.  I see tarot as a language that we use to speak to our Higher Selves and the language used by the Osho cards is pure poetry.<br /><br />I recommend this deck for those that are new to tarot and to those that are seasoned professionals.  You won't be disappointed!

B0015ABRE2|4.0|Dexter season 3 arrived within a couple of days of placing the order. There was one episode that kept freezing throughout, but luckily would only last a second or two and we did not miss any of the episode. Still was irritating. Season 3 is not as captivating as seasons 1 and 2 were, but still entertaining to watch. Would recommend purchasing but don't expect the same suspense you were used to in the first two seasons.
B001NWI64G|5.0|I missed the Fleet Foxes debut on the various talk shows and Saturday Night Live as they were introduced to the world, and only came across them as they were recommended by a fellow fan of the Moody Blues. They don't sound like the Moody Blues, but they have a similar progressive folk-rock sound, with absolutely dynamite harmonies the caliber of which is rarely seen outside of a Crosby, Stills and Nash or the Beach Boys, and they are THAT good as well.    Check them out on YouTube, if you haven't seen them perform; they are just as good on the stage as they are in the studio, which just amazes me, since the 4-part harmony vocals demand that each plays their part to near perfection, and the resulting magnificence is as dramatic and awe-inspiring as if performed in an acoustic-perfect cathedral. The dynamics of this music sends a chill down my spine, and moves me in ways any band seldom can!    Where they remind me of the Moody Blues is more in the experimental aspect of the music; the unique instrumentation has that same feel of finding just the right tool to construct a particular desired effect. Fleet Foxes hit me as refreshing and new and yet strangely familiar, and the style fits in just as well if it had come from the 70's or today, with even some nods towards the Renaissance-era. I hear so many recognizable influences, and still the whole becomes something completely unique, a greater sum of it's parts than each individuals' contributions.    I'm sure their fans are wondering as I am, when that next CD will be coming forth, but I'm more than happy to wait until they've been able to assemble a follow-up that meets the incredibly high standards of this first effort. I'm sure looking forward to it, and hopefully at some point they can give us a nice concert DVD as well, or better yet, I hope to see them tour in my area at some point. This music ranks right up there with my most favorite artists, and yet Fleet Foxes earned that spot with just a single album! But WHAT an album that is! This is a MUST have! And getting this version with the bonus tracks allows you to get most of what was on their other mini-release, so this becomes the current essential FF offering as it's nearly their entire catalog.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|Hooky songs that just beg to be sung along with. The best songs weren't released as singles. Sexy, smokey vocals over a mostly guitar-driven backdrop. Check out Heroes, Lie, Bar-Ba-Sol. Permanent is the best song on the record.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was simply blown away by the variety of music on this CD.  Susan's range is phenomenal; singing everything from classical, blues, \\"Southern Spiritual\\", traditional gospel, Broadway, etc.  Her range is just amazing and there is not even a hint of her Scottish accent on many of these songs.  My absolute favorites are \\"Up To The Mountain\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\".  I am so impressed by the technical quality of this CD as well as Susan's personal song choices.  IF I had to pick one least favorite it would be Wild Horses, but that's simply a personal opinion. I'm sure others will love it.  I do have a comment about the back cover photo - PHOTOSHOPPED TO DEATH!!  It's a lovely photo and should have been left alone. The front cover and inside photos are faily true to life but the back cover makes her look like she's 25 years old.  I would recommend this CD for just about anyone on your Christmas list who loves beautiful music.  The CD version of I Dreamed A Dream is, of course, technically perfect and just lovely, but I sort of miss the original BGT version, which I still play all the time.  I think this \\"perfect\\" version looses some of the simplicity and shock value of Susan's very first performance - it's a bit too PERFECT - but, perfectly lovely none the less.  BUY THIS CD!!
B001AVCFJM|3.0|I gave this a 3 star rating because although I thought the movie was awesome, the special features were horrible. The movie and story was great, and I enjoyed the pace and updated look and format in regards to the other Star Trek movies.<br />What I did NOT like was the \\"special features\\" that came out with the DVD release. The 'making of' was more like a 30 minute tribute to the director and consisted of nothing but ego strokes to J.J. Adams rather than showing how the movie was made (which is a shame because i love special features about how movies are made). It was a REAL disappointment. The outtakes were OK, but there was a large break in the middle of them consisting of the director smacking on different microphones. The director must have an ego the size of Mars with how much pomp and circumstance he was given in both the 'making of' and 'outtakes.' I wish I would have spent the $19 for the regular version DVD instead of $29 for the special edition: the over-the-top ego stroking of the director left a bad taste in my mouth.

B002VKE0XA|5.0|Paranormal Activity has terrified and greatly affected the majority of the audience that has had a chance to view this astounding piece of work. Oren Peli, the director, has no professional experience whatsoever. Shot in just a mere seven days, using a minuscule budget of $15,000, the film utilizes a couple of relatively inexperienced leading actors, and a soundtrack of absolute silence. The hairs of nearly every viewer are raised each time the leading pair falls asleep. Unlike other recent horror films that boast screaming attractive women, two tons of fake blood and gore, a horrible, disgustingly cheesy script, and implausible explosions, this film works wonders with average looking actors, improvised screenplay with situational suggestions.    The basic premise of this shockingly simple haunted house tale is that successful day-trader Micah and English teacher Katie have recently moved in together after dating for some time. Prior to the first few moments of the audience sees, Katie tells a skeptical Micah that paranormal activity has been bothering her since her childhood and he reacts by purchasing a video camera to capture any abnormal activity that might manifest itself while they sleep to prove her wrong. The film follows the day-to-night-day-night life of the couple. The realism of the film is finely showcased with the mundane conversations and bantering of the couple during the day, to the slightly begging of using the camera to record sexual activities by Micah before night falls. The audience laughs during the day sequences at some of the hilarity; some recollecting similar humor in their own relationships. But then night falls. The audience suddenly grows silent. What follows after that are goosebumps, gasps of horror, some frightened audience members leaving the theater, and some audience members shaking in their seats.    The film is not like a Hollywood film. In fact, it is not but it was adopted by Paramount Pictures after they were astounded by itswidely marketable potential. The marketing scheme has thus far worked superbly but it is unfair to view the film with those high expectations of perfection. The film has some outstanding flaws even with its best quality being its engrossing realism and is by no means, the greatest film of the year, nor is it the scariest film of all-time. Those expectations are not fair. While the film may not be scarier than the scariest film of all-time in your opinion, it is arguably the most psychologically affecting film of the decade because of how effectively it strips you of the mental securities of your safest haven: your own home.    Thus far, no other film has frightened me so, and still, I cannot deny how much I would love to see it again, because of how beautifully it has been made. Paranormal Activity is not just one of the scariest film of the decade, it is one of the best independent films of the year.

B002VECMA4|3.0|An uneven buddy caper that rides mainly on the abilities of its impeccable casting, \\"The Men Who Stare At Goats\\" takes a seriously weird moment in military stupidity and pokes gentle fun at it. There was once a New Earth Army (called The First Earth Battalion) that the CIA experimented with as a Psychic Warfare Operation. What should have you irritated about a waste of your tax dollars gets spoofed into a Hollywood movie. So much for the \\"liberal media,\\" right?<br /><br />As such, it's still a good time waster. Milquetoast Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) wants to prove to his ex-wife that he's an exciting man, so he talks his way into an Iraqi reporter position. It is there where he bumbles into the Special Forces Operator, Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), whom Bob once referenced in a story about psychic warfare. Soon Bob convinces Lyn to take him along on his mission, and Lyn's intermittent explanations about the New Earth Army appears in anecdotal bits, often very humorously.<br /><br />The supporting cast makes up for the slowness of the overall film, with Jeff Bridges leading the pack as Bill Django, the best of the psychic warriors. Stephen Lang steals the show in just a few scenes as somewhat loopy Brigadier General Dean Hopgood. Kevin Spacey is fine as the creepy trouble maker Larry Hooper, but you've seen him do this a million times and his character here has nothing new to offer. And finally, Robert Patrick is a hoot as contractor at large Todd Nixon, appearing for no apparent reason but still amusing.<br /><br />\\"The Men Who Stare At Goats\\" is episodic, and that's its main drag. It never seems to find its footing, and the ending is contrived. The [[ASIN:1439181772 original non-fiction book]] detailed disturbing and often hilarious interviews with men who would tell journalist Jon Ronson about the real attempts Presidents Reagen and Bush 2 put into creating these regiments. But as the movie sputters into its final act and all Jon/Bob gets out of his reports is either ignored or mocked, its a bit frustrating to watch the movie of his work walk the wire between reality and the farcical so unevenly.its a bit frustrating to watch the movie of his work walk the wire between reality and the farcical so unevenly.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|Lamb of God's fifth album proper, 2009's \\"Wrath,\\" continues down a similar path as to what was heard on its predecessor, 2006's \\"Sacrament,\\" in that it brings back some of that effort's experimental elements. It has well-textured musical arrangements, occasional moments of restraint, and overall, is substantially more melodic, progressive, groove-oriented, and black metal-influenced than 2000's \\"New American Gospel,\\" 2003's \\"As the Palaces Burn,\\" and 2004's \\"Ashes of the Wake.\\" However, L.O.G. have not made the same album twice, and they aren't about to start now. Thus, \\"Wrath\\" finds the band expanding on their songwriting and dynamic range even further while also bringing back the cutthroat tempos, political lyrics, and foaming-at-the-mouth anger of their earlier material. This is the band's first conceptual piece, too (its intelligent subject matter is inspired by the story of the ten plagues from the book of Exodus in The Bible). It also marks the inclusion of a new producer (Josh Wilbur, who delivers a clear and articulate sound). And finally, this just in: There is proof that Lamb of God actually have a bassist! The bass work of John Campbell (who was rarely audible up until now) really helps to thoroughly fill the bottom-end by laying down both melodic bass lines and heavy, guttural bass rumbles.<br /><br />Even with an increased melodic sensibility, monstrous guitar riffage, excellent solos, tight and precise drumming, meaty bass fills, huge grooves, awesomely visceral growls, freaky, lung-stretching shrieks, and chunky breakdowns are mostly the name of the game this time around. The end result is an album that sounds simultaneously more dangerous and more well-textured and rich-sounding record than its predecessor. Instrumental opener \\"The Passing\\" is a positively breathtaking prog-rock soundscape that would not be mismatched coming off of, say, an Agalloch or Katatonia outing. But soon thereafter, the listener is slammed like a brick wall into \\"In Your Words,\\" a very headbangable and number with fiery guitar work, catchy vocal patterns, and rhythmic, pounding rhythms. Indeed, this one should instantly become a fan favourite, and a staple of live shows. Surprisingly, though, it concludes with a slow break and docile progressive outro. In \\"Set To Fail,\\" Randy delivers an impassioned, black metal-lite vocal performance long on sustained shrieks, thus helping to make this fist-pumper even more commanding and memorable. These three beginning tracks establish a relatively mid-tempo pace/mood, but it is immediately blown wide-open by song number four. \\"Contractor\\" is a positively breakneck death-tinged Eighties-style thrasher with dizzying, whirlwind buzzsaw picking, thunderous, jackhammer-fast drumming, technical tempo changes, and a distorted bass bottom. Lamb of God briefly lay off the gas pedal when a doomy breakdown enters the picture about midway through, and John Campbell is allowed a moment in the spotlight with an excellent bass solo (yes, you read that right!).<br /><br />\\"Wrath\\" continues with \\"Fake Messiah,\\" which is a much slower and more involved venture complete with skin-crawling vocals (including a creepy-to-the-bone spoken word part), and a really cool and ominous atmosphere. \\"Grace\\" has some grooving, swinging rhythms and slow-burning tempos that bring the above-mentioned \\"Sacrament\\" to mind. But that's the case only about half of the time -- the rest of the time, this is a really heavy, and hard-driving song anchored by Chris Adler's impeccable pummelling drum blasts. \\"Broken Sands\\" practically has \\"huge mosh-pit-anthem\\" written all-over it (after all, it often grooves as well as anything from Pantera's heyday!), but its groove-oriented approach is offset by \\"Dead Seets,\\" a brutal, frills-free, head-down speedster propelled by gobs of blistering riffs and impeccable thrash beats; and \\"Everything To Nothing,\\" with its fast, hoof-pounding beat, and chunked-up, machine gun, Slayer-esque guitar licks galore,is even more merciless. \\"Choke Sermon\\" is highlighted by an epic, memorable, technically-proficient, and totally ripping and wailing guitar solo (it's but one example of the kind that are scattered here and there throughout these forty-six minutes). Set closer \\"Reclamation\\" mostly offers some more of the same (and what you're comfortable with: punishing, dissonant heavy metal), although it does have a noteworthy beginning (a nice, placid bit of melody, and near-country/banjo-sounding guitar strums).<br /><br />Admittedly, it could use a few more immediate infectious hooks and air-guitar-worthy moments, but overall, \\"Wrath\\" can easily be placed right alongside Lamb of God's best work. Plus, one can make the argument that this outing is their most accomplished, expansive, and well-rounded to date. And, if nothing else, it is at least yet another winner from L.O.G., a very enjoyable and exhilarating release, and one that is sure to rank near the top of more than a few \\"Best of 2009\\" lists come year's end.ciless. \\"Choke Sermon\\" is highlighted by an epic, memorable, technically-proficient, and totally ripping and wailing guitar solo (it's but one example of the kind that are scattered here and there throughout these forty-six minutes).

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'm a long time Trek fan, and was very worried about how this movie would turn out.  However I was extremely pleased when I finally got to see it in the theater.  While this movie does lean a bit more towards the action side, there is plenty of character development as we see young Jim Kirk struggling in a life of mediocrity rise to take command of the ship and crew that would make them all legends.  I felt that JJ's use of the time line reset button here was very well done, and that this is going to leave the door wide open towards new stories in the Trek universe.     I've been reading some of the negative comments on this movie, and I feel that these are more then likely one of 2 types of people.  The ones that just have to yell out against something for no other reason then it's popular, and the ones that were just mad because Bill Shatner wasn't included in the story.  I've yet to see a one or two star review on here that makes me think that these people actually saw the movie.  They mostly just seem to be spewing out the hate from other websites.  Sad really.
B000VVS1MC|5.0|This CD is by far the best solo Dave Gahan CD. I think he has finally found his niche for his own style of music. It has dark undertones and has subtle hints of Depeche Mode's album Ultra. Great CD!!
B00011F5DK|2.0|This is okay if you like Tetris and have all four players.  Otherwise not too fun.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Without a doubt Amon Amarth occupy their very own sub-genre of music; that of 'catchy' death metal. How a band this loud and heavy can be so unbelievably melodic in almost every song is still a mystery to me; I guess they are just hugely talented songwriters. I've read quite a few reviews saying they need to vary the songs more but why should they? They have found their style, no one else sounds quite like them and I for one love how they sound right now. If you enjoyed the 'Fate of Norns' album then you're gonna love this one. Superb stuff boys, keep it up!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|At last a CD that matched the caliber of the musical.  Great to see modern musicals making a comeback.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am almost through the first 30 days of this workout.  And it is tough but I definitely see a difference already in lost inches and pounds.  And my arm muscles are more defined.  I'm getting ready to try level 3.  The levels are progressively harder but you can go back to the lower levels and use heavier weights to increase intensity and keep from getting bored.  If you really want to kick it up a notch, add in 30 minutes of cardio a couple times a week.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|WARNING:  THIS REVIEW CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS.   STOP READING RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN THIS FILM AND WANT TO DO SO WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS.      Ok, you've been warned.  If you're still reading ...    Firstly, I'll agree with many of the other reviewers that there are no real surprises in this film.  It is a bit predictable ...    And SO WHAT IF IT IS???    Whilst the scenery is so beautiful (and captured so perfectly that it comes to play its own character, albeit not a major one, in this gem of a film) that it is almost distractingly so, there is a story here that, although nothing new, still very much bears telling.      Why?    Because this story, simple as it appears, never gets old, as long as it is told exceptionally well.  It is a story of deep meaning, one that is relevant to many.    Simply put, this is a story about a man who \\"finds himself\\", to utilize that tired cliche.  Yet most cliches do have more than just a grain of truth to them, and this film is no exception.  Max Skinner, a bonds trader in England, is exceptionally good at his job, quite wealthy, a leader in his field ... in short, quite Alpha.      Yet when his beloved Uncle Henri dies, leaving (or so it seems) to Max a breath-takingly beautiful vineyard in the south of France, Max must journey to this place where he spent his summers.  Max returns to the place where, with his uncle's tutelage, he gained his first insight into what it is to be a successful man.    As the story goes on, Max must come to know Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish playing a role that proves to be a lovely addition to this film), a young lady claiming to be his Uncle's illegitimate daughter.  He also re-connects with the DuFlot's, caretakers of the vineyard and villa, and also his close childhood friends.  Most importantly, he encounters Fanni, a girl he does not remember from his childhood, but who clearly remembers him ... or, at least, the person he used to be.    What is so striking about this admittedly-cliched\\"successful businessman who finds himself\\" story is that Max discovers a part of himself he forgot without rejecting the man he has become.  In the end, what's most remarkable is that this person that Max was as a child becomes quite integrated with who Max now is as a man.  He doesn't regret his success in business, nor does he become Mr. Touchy-Feely, but there is much sincerity and wisdom in Max as he realizes where his heart and soul truly lie.      At the film's close, we're left in the knowledge that Max is: #1, in love with a truly beautiful woman of great emotional depth (can't do without that), fiesty disposition (always a delicious treat, most especially if you happen to be an alpha male) and true kindness (again, can't do without this either); #2, reconnecting to his departed Uncle through continuing the operation of the vineyard in tandem with his cousin Christie (whom he has now accepted as being truthful in her claim of being Henri's daughter); and #3, content to move forward into the future in a greater understanding that it is a man's roots, and also the family that he creates in his life, that define his identity, just as much as do his successes in business, science, art, law, and the like.         Granted, perhaps at least a bit of the above is my interpretation, but what of it?  Excellent films deserve various interpretations, and now, you've heard mine.  If you haven't seen this film yet, please do so, as you are in for a real treat.  If you have seen this film, then perhaps you'll be inclined to agree with my interpretation.  (If you don't agree, please understand in advance that you have no chance whatsoever of disuading me from my position; I'm impossible once I've got my mind made up.)    In sum total, I could very much relate to Max, and that's why I enjoy this film so much, the oh-so-very-lovely women, gorgeous scenery, and fine wine and French villa notwithstanding.      Enjoy!!
0140072187|5.0|I first read this book 22 years ago and was amazed by the action in this book.  I gave some serious thought to getting a helicopter pilot license, but life got in the way and that has not happened.  I just came across the title recently and decided to buy it again.  Wow, did I forget a lot in those 22 years.  This book is an excellent read.<br /><br />The book tells the tale of Bob Mason and his military flying career.  He was a Huey slick pilot in Vietnam.  The writing is fantastic, but sad.  It covers a very dangerous and stressful time in Bobs life.  I guess I would be pretty stressed out if I had \\"the little people\\" shooting at me every day.  I cannot even begin to cover the detailed missions where the writing is so intense it makes you feel as if you are right there with him.  If you like action, you will like this book.<br /><br />The books ends at a very low point in Bobs life, after he is discharged from the Army.  He spirals into heavy drinking, nightmares, and lots of prescription medications to try to find some peace and get some sleep.  That sounded like a tough time in our history because even civilians on the street would call him a \\"murderer\\".  He was a helicopter pilot, he did not shoot people (even the people trying to shoot him)  I never could understand why civilians would punish a soldier instead of the politicians that are actually running the show.  But thats another story for another time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Maybe its time to look into that helicopter pilot license again?<br /><br />Chris
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I thought this was one of Dan Brown's best books to date.  The storyline was great, and the suspense decent (although a tad bit too predictable, and of course the good guys win, the bad guys loses...).  One thing that bothered me a LOT about this book was how preachy it was.  It starts off at the beginning saying how sourced and factual everything is, and then goes and tries to convert you to a certain way of thinking by blatantly misquoting so many sources.  Do I recommend it?  Yes.  But be prepared to be \\"evangelized\\" - don't know why, but more and more Dan Brown is attempting to do this with his books - I really wish he'd quit.
B002QONHQC|5.0|CD arrived in great shape.  Case was slighty scratched, but the disc played well.
B00005K9LK|5.0|priest comes up with a classic metal album for the masses.  They made classics before vengence, but they wern't the most popluar of albums like this one was.  The best songs are the title track,  riding on the wind and the devils child. Once again, great stuff from the priest!
1400063736|2.0|The story line was disjointed.  What was the purpose of the wirewalker in the scheme of things.  Too many vulgar words.  People may talk that way, however, personally I don't like to read them.
B00005K9LN|4.0|Priest Just keep releasing great albums.  British steel is another gem, though i find it hard to give this one 5 stars with the likes of breaking the law, living after midnight, and the poor mans Queen like anthem \\"united\\". not like those songs are horrible,  but they're not vintage either.  The vintage priest songs here are rapid fire, metal gods, grinder and \\"the rage\\". Once again, priest delivers the goods!
0061564893|5.0|The book arrived on time.  Great book. Will change the way history in the future will be taught in our schools.
B00005K9LM|3.0|Priest releasing another popular metal album, though this one is a bit weaker than screaming for vengence.  Still, some classic here. Does have some filler songs like \\"heavy duty\\"  and some others that were popular back then but don't stand up very well today, like \\"love bites\\" and \\"some heads are gonna roll.\\" 3.5 stars for this one.
B000092T6M|4.0|I've avoided this film for years.  It is surprisingly action-packed in a good way and the settings are appropriate.  Alan Rickman's character of the Sheriff of Nottingham, George, is marvelous and with the deleted scenes, much more interesting than Robin Hood's.  Morgan Freeman does a credible job which could have been expanded.  I found muting Kostner each time he spoke to vastly improve the watching experience.  It isn't so much his American accent in an English setting as the lack of emotional depth.  He has none at all.  He looks the part, can't act it, though.  Pay extra for the deleted scenes as they are worth it.
B00005R62K|5.0|only slightly behind the classic \\"sad wings of destiny\\"  I always loved the sound of this album, and it's filled with classics like \\"beyond the relms of death\\" and \\"exciter.\\"  Good stuff from the priest.
0786868724|5.0|Mitch Albom is an excellent writer.  I enjoyed that he shared his innermost feelings about his faith and how he increasingly progressed to appreciating his  background, rearing, and the realization of the integrity and faith of both men, who were very different, but so much alike.  It is good to read about the goodness of people in a world that is on such a \\"slippery slope\\" with morals and integrity today so difficult to find.
B000R7D0EE|5.0|This book is John Steinbeck's greatest work! It is full of wisdom and has lots of autobiographical material about the author. Steinbeck writes beautifully so that the reader gets a clear picture of the people and places in the story. It is a study of good and evil as the story unfolds. You can draw your own conclusions as to whether there are any completely good or evil people in the world, and what the author thinks. It shows Steinbeck's love of the Salinas area in California and makes you want to visit. As it traces three generations of families, you don't want to stop reading until you find out what happens to them.
1594488916|2.0|This book was essentially a padded magazine article.  The pathetic book thief was a sociopath and not particularly interesting.  I don't think the author necessarily was naive or identified with thief; I think she just needed to pad out her story.  .     A much better introduction to book collecting and book thieves is Basbane's A Gentle Madness (as well as his other excellent works).    I would skip it.  I am selling it back on Amazon.
B0028K3192|4.0|I like pretty wings on the CD the rest of thesongs are very   nice & relaxing.
B00005O5CM|3.0|A student used a clip for this movie in her presentation on classical rhetoric for or rhetoric/composition class.  It was the scene where the blonde is crossexamining the wintess and uses the witness's own words to prove she had lied.  I plan on showing that clip in the future!  The movie is cute, but not one I'd watch a doxen times.
B001JE25ZE|4.0|I Am Legend is (if you've read other reviews) great. The rest of the book is meh. Once I finished I Am Legend I foud myself kinda forcing myself to read the rest. With anywhere from 4-12 pages for each story its kinda hard to care about most of the events or people in the stories.
B00008X5J1|1.0|This is a great movie, but I bought the edited for TV version and it was by no means edited at all! The first 1/3 of the video was fine, but full-frontal nudity and graphic intercourse scenes soon followed. Completely over the top for my 11th grade US History class to witness.
1878424505|5.0|Don Miguel Ruiz explains so clearly, why these 4 agreements will make a powerful impact on your life. I have been practicing them for years and know they have made my life better. I also have the cassette tapes of the book read by Peter Coyote. A simple book with a powerful message.
B00133KFGW|5.0|During a time when action and animated violent films are all the rage, it's so refreshing to see a film that makes you feel good.  It's well-written, well-acted, and has an unusual story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  This is a must for adult viewing.
B00012FXAE|4.0|This movie was not as suspenseful and had a lot more action than the first film. The alien was further explained through the queen. The story was well put together and the scene with Ripley's daughter really connected what Newt meant to her. It had a nice ending similar to the first one, but it was missing the suspense of the first film. I liked that there was more action but they should have kept the suspense element more prominently. The aliens looked a lot more realistic in this one which helped add to the believability of the film. About the same rating as the first simply because the action sequences were just simple and have been out done in years since, but the alien idea is still a unique one. The original holds up a bit better because suspense will always hold up where action sequences will be outdone with new technology.
0316017922|1.0|If the author chose an attention-grabbing idea - it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert - for a magazine article, but then decided to capitalize on the popularity of his two earlier books by simply padding it out and publishing it as a book, cherry-picking anything that looked like it might support the idea, without much concern for accuracy or respect for the reader, Outliers could have been the result.
B000LPR9ZS|4.0|This should have in my opinion been the final movie. It was a trilogy and you don't want to bleed the franchise dry. Unfortunately money came into effect and there are now 6 Saw movies. The movie follows a man's path of revenge against those that hurt his son. He decides for the victims whether to let them die or help them survive. It is really connected to Saw IV so watch them back to back. Also it revolves a lot around Jigsaw's assistant. Without ruining the plot points I won't give away who that is.  Also a doctor was chosen to help save Jigsaw. There are a lot of connections to Saw I and II, which help the movie. There is a lot of great character development that was a bit lacking in Saw II. The ending is awesome, perhaps the best in the series. It really ties all the characters together and leaves you breathless.
0061339202|5.0|I thought this was going to be a book about how to increase concentration and performance on complex tasks, but it turned out to be more about assessing yourself and your circumstances and becoming better adjusted - the pursuit of happiness. Writing style has changed so much recently that the book feels like it was written in 1970 not 1990, but you have to try to ignore that and connect with the author's empathy to get the most out of it.
B00023B1LC|3.0|This movie I believe suffers from years of hype and now that I have finally seen it I am somewhat disappointed. It had a lot of action, but not really that memorable. The plot was good a little slow at first but did speed up as the film progressed. I believe now that he knows his true identity that the next films will be better. It was a good spy movie but is beaten by movie franchises such as Mission Impossible and James Bond. Also Matt Damon's performance was a little bland and heartless at times. The overall tone of the movie was drab and somewhat depressing which hurt the action of the film.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|I don't consider myself a Trekkie, but I have seen all the movies and many episodes of the various TV shows.  I don't really get into the high minded utopia vision of the series, but at least some of the episodes and movies have enough intelligence to make you think once in a while.  Not this one.      While the action scenes look very good, the context of them often doesn't make sense.  The crazy drill thing hanging from the Romulan ship?  Child Kirk trashing the Corvette?   Star Trek isn't one of those hyper realistic physics type movies, but one can't help but be reminded of the scene in Galaxy Quest where the characters are forced through a gauntlet of crazy chopping and crunching devices to reach their objective.  One look at the interior of the Romulan ship and you have to ask, who in their right mind would design a ship like this?    Then of course the whole deal with Kirk landing conveniently where he left the Enterprise.  What are the odds of something like that happening?    While I didn't find the movie hard to sit through, the more I thought about it afterward, the more felt that my intelligence had been insulted.  It just seems that the people that developed the movie had their plot (such as it is) all laid out but weren't creative enough to come up with plausible reasons for events happening as they did.  So instead they just relied on fantastic coincidences and glaring inconsistencies and just hoped the audience was too stupid to notice.  Either that or they figured people pointing these things out would just be dismissed as fan boys too caught up in the details to see the full picture.      Unfortunately it doesn't take a Star Trek fanatic to notice the poor design of this movie.  It just takes someone with a brain.
B000EWBKLC|5.0|I haven't seen this movie since it's release, but it's Halloween and I decided to do a Saw marathon. This movie is perhaps the best in the series. It has a lot of mystery and suspense. I think not knowing who Jigsaw is adds to the enjoyment. The later installments peeled the mystery away from him and it hurt the overall feel of the franchise. This movie does not have a lot of traps, they are not as elaborate as the traps in the sequel, but they are nicely used. There are so many twists and turns in this movie it's hard to even guess the next turn. I personally like Danny Glover and he does a great job. He should have been a more central character. The entire movie your trying to figure out who jigsaw is and that adds to the movie's greatness. As the series progressed the mystery element was taken away piece by piece. There are a lot of characters interacting around this \\"game\\" and that adds to the overall feel of desperation of this movie. This movie is a classic. The rest in the series decide to stand on gore instead of real suspense. This is a classic worth treasuring.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Simply Perfection.  There is little to add to those comments already provided in other 5-star reviews for this CD of Susan's.  Vocals are superb and the simplicity of the arrangements let her vocals shine thru without overkill on the instrumentation and background singers.  I like the variation of the song selections, and each one seems to have been selected by Susan to enable her to open up her heart to her fans to allow them to get to know her more personally by the words she sings. I think they are more than songs - - they tell her own story in many ways.      God has blessed her fans by allowing Susan to share her talent with the world after all these years.  And I think because she put her own dream (to be a singer)on \\"hold\\" for many years to unselfishly take care of her mother, it is God's way of saying to Susan \\"thank you being a faithful servant,and now it is your turn to shine and have your dream come true\\".      I was so hoping that this first CD would be a hit and not receive negativity, since that would be so hurtful for Susan to have withstood.  And thankfully, she will not have to worry about that!  Well done Susan.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Gran Torino(WideScreen Edition DVD):    Let me start by Saying I am a big Clint fan, however I won't go see Invictus because it seems to be typical Mandela Propaganda(he's a Communist/castrolover), So I am disappointed Clint Directed that Film,That Said, This movie Should Have won Best Movie! I am not one for Redemption movies, but Thought Clint did a Great job, The Car,Sadly A Ford Gran Torino 1972, (I like Vettes.then Chevy/GM) doesn't do much nor do you hear the engine roar(or Sputter?-Ford)But the point is the movie, the Acting, The Main Character's Family, and how they could care less about him and just want him to croak or live in a Old Folks Home*Near Typical American family* is very sad.People don't have any morals or respect anymore,especially the youth(and Btw I am 27,was raised different). The movie may not be Politically Correct for some of the puritanical people out there because of the Slurs and such,But the movie is a Winner.
B001IF252M|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is at college and has her own flatscreen TV in her room.  She wanted to be able to hook up her Mac laptop to her TV so that she could watch either DVD's played on her laptop or streamed programs from Hulu.  She was able to get this hooked up and is really happy with the setup.
0061864153|5.0|Look, I have liked Bon Jovi since 1985 when I first heard U give love a bad name....  So I'm a little biased. However, This CD and DVD are just so good. The entire CD has great lyrics and music. The songwriting team of Jon and Richie is right up there with the best of them.    You need to buy this. You won't regret it. The DVD is awesome too. :)
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|You bet a Blu-Ray version, a DVD Version, and a Digital Copy for [...] bucks.  What's not to love?  The move was great too.
B000FUF6QS|4.0|This film is a reflection of it's era, the 70's being as they were.  There is nudity and lewdness in a quaint Scottish village, and the plot builds deliciously to a shocking climax. Good music, too.
B001AVCFJM|3.0|Come on Paramount! What's the deal. I was overlooking the special features for the 2 Disc DVD set and the Blu-Ray edition of the film. The Blu-Ray comes with with 30 featurettes while the the 2 disc comes with only 9? I think not! The one good thing is that they both come with the digital copy. I advise that if you have a Blu-Ray player, you have the better edition of the movie. I'm skipping out on the DVD version.
0061537969|5.0|This book will stay with you long after you're finished.  Enzo is a warm and gentle philosopher of the human (and canine) condition.  This is one of those rare tales that one can't stop reading but will miss when it comes to an end.   I re-read the last two chapters three times before I finally put it down.  You will love Enzo as if he were your own.
0061733199|5.0|Well done guide, covers a ton of material well, right down to when to cook the cat and dog!
0790729393|5.0|This film boasts an amazing cast, all at the top of their game.  This is reason enough to see the film.  The story, whether or not it is factual, is stunning.  You won't forget it.  I do warn any sensitive types that there are scenes that you might not want to see.  I stopped watching it after the intense scenes of brutality in the boys' correctional institution.  However, in a few days I returned to see how it would end, and I'm glad I did.      Robert DeNiro underplays his role beautifully, portraying the most sympathetic and hunky priest since Bing Crosby.  Dustin Hoffman, whom I often dislike, came through with an almost comic performance.  It wasn't supposed to be, and perhaps Hoffman overplayed it a little.  Still, it's quite colorful and adds to the overall gritty tone of the film.  Brad Pitt is wonderful and reminded me that he's much more than a pretty face.  Minnie Driver was her usual warm hearted self and adopted a very good New York accent for the role.  Kevin Bacon is slimy evil incarnate--another perfect performance.     All in all, this is a well made film, and, if you can stomach some heart-wrenching brutality, it's worth watching.
B000YJ85BI|2.0|After reading \\"Old Man's War,\\" and it's sequel \\"Ghost Brigades,\\" I was sold on Scalzi. Even though he put just a tad too much of his insufferable leftist political spin on things, I chose to overlook it - especially since he seemed to be that rarity, a Lefty who respects the military tradition.    But with \\"The Lost Colony\\" he allowed his p.c. fever to get the best of him. Suddenly, the Earthlings and their military are \\"the evil ones,\\" and of course the really good guys simply MUST be homosexual. (He repeats that old, long-discredited yarn about legendary homosexual lovers paired as soldiers - never happened, Scalzi, and I'm pretty sure you know it).    I got about a third of the way through this book before I just couldn't take it any more. When leftist politics intrude, BOREDOM inevitably ensues. I found myself yawning through each page, and finally just gave up.    So I guess this is really only a review of one-third of the book.    I have \\"Zoe's Tale\\" still sitting on my bookshelf, untouched. I'm tired of Leftist drivel, so I'll give it away to my local book-swap store.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|It was one of the best movies with Sandra Bullock. She is getting better as an actress and it was fun to watch her grow. The movie was written well to encompass the conflict in this relationship. It was a good romantic comedy. I enjoyed the casting of Betty White. She was adorable and funny. It was good to see in a role that fit her. It was the first time that I've noticed Ryan Reynolds and I liked him.  He played his role well.
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|This movie is great for anyone looking for great action sequences which aren't necessarily realistic. You need to do a bit more than the usual \\"suspension of disbelief\\" here. If you can accept this movie's ideas such as bullets that can curve around objects (there's more than 1 \\"magic bullet\\" here...) then you'll enjoy it. I don't know how they did the effects and stunts, but they are some of the most entertaining action scenes I've seen. Sequences such as one where a car jumps off another car to spin over a third car are enough to make you go \\"wow\\".     There's more to the movie than just action. The story is fairly interesting, centering around a secret society of assassins who are supposedly working to maintain order in the world. James McAvoy's character Wesley is one whom many people will be able to identify with - stuck in a boring cubicle job with a boss he hates, a girlfriend who holds him in contempt, and a \\"best friend\\" with whom the girlfriend is cheating. Clearly, he's more than a little unsatisfied with his life so he soon jumps at the chance of a completely different life when the assassin Fox (Angelina Jolie) springs into his life. He soon meets the head of the assassins, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), who tells him all about his father, an assassin who was recently killed by a rogue member. Wesley then trains to become an assassin to go after his father's killer. The movie also has the prerequisite plot twist in addition to the many car chase and fight scenes and explosive final confrontation.    The acting by McAvoy, Jolie, and Freeman is very good, as you would expect from those of their caliber; however, the best part about the movie is the action sequences. With special effects reminiscent of \\"The Matrix\\", the action can be unrealistic at times but never disappoints. There's never a dull moment. If you enjoy action movies with a bit of a story, give this one a try.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Love this series!  This touches your heart no matter who you are. It brings up a myriad of emotions and takes your mind off the day to day things. Everyone should own this. Give it as a gift this Christmas and you will be on the A list forever!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This was a great buy and saved me a lot of money. 9 foot cables are not a common size in the retail stores so selection is limited, and the cost is much higher.  When I need another HDMI cable, I'll buy this again.
0691142165|4.0|Not a particularly easy book to read, but if you want to know why this time is different (or not) take a good look at this book. You will not regret digging into it.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This product was received in a very timely manner, in great, new condition, and was an AWESOME purchase.  I love the Sons and started watching it when Season Two began, so I just had to buy Season One and your site was the cheapest!  Thank you for the excellent service!
B000AP04OM|1.0|Have you awakened in the abyss of a midnight's cold-sweat, after an evening of viewing this thing, wondering why you were so manipulated by it?<br />It was unearthed in 1965 from a hidden cache of Leni Riefenstahl's archival films ca 1939. You were never told this?<br />It was SS propaganda. Its initial intent was to demonstrate the moral decadence of Europe in general and the Austrian aristocracy in particular. It was meant to incite class warfare. Worse, it is cryptically pornographic and irreligious...a Mother Superior admonishing an aspiring nun to 'climb every mountain', 'search high and low'? Or, the widowed sea captain singing 'Idle-vice, Idle-vice...every morning you greet me'.<br /><br />The goat in the play; at first her eyes were flirtatious in their innocence. In skips the old roue (his hips suggestively a-jerkin') and they turn to sheer terror. More on the goatherds and goats later.<br /><br />The message? It is so obvious; these swinehunds are singing, dancing, partying, lusting and romancing whilst the winds of war are lashing the planet. But, for these oblivious numb-skulls, the bellicose air-currents are simply billowing clouds and skirts.<br />We, The Enemy, are mindless fools. Cattle. The Bovidae actually believe they can solve or escape the world's ills with some songs and dances.<br />This was widely screened across the Vaterland in '39, but it was pulled. Rather than inflaming socialist passions, it was putting audiences to sleep. It was a disaster. Students, so exposed, were failing classes. Or worse, some were caught, the next day, humming mindless tunes and trying to seduce their classmates. The teen-pregnancy rate soared, amidst promises of Rolf's \\"I'll take care of you\\" mantra. Marriages were destroyed as frustrated hausfraus, realizing they were not married to C Plummer, joined the nearest nunnery. Husbands were fantasizing about nuns in lonely dark corners. Sweet little girls in pale pink coats could not walk the hills alone. Goatherds were conscripted into the German High Command. The goats went feral, their numbers exploded without the seminal competition from their overlords, resulting in the denudation of the slopes...it was an ecological catastrophe. Gestapo/SS brass were 'toasted' for their failure of proper oversight. A rent in the very fabric of Teutonic society was imminent.<br /><br />The film's final scenes were never seen by American audiences. All of the Nazi/Brownshirt 'incompetence' was, in fact, a clever ruse to capture the entire family alone in the woods. The lonely goatherds had their way with the little girls. Need I say it was not a happy ending.<br /><br />Here, in America, 26 years later, it was hailed as a masterpiece with endless kudos and awards. Did we really win the war?
0385341008|2.0|I didn't finish this book.  I just wasn't able to get into it since it's written in letter style back and forth.  I think writing in such a style is an author's easy way out quite honestly.  It requires no depth, no guts, no true character...nothing.  This book would have been readable to me had the author taken the time to at least write in a different POV with a well developed character.

0439023491|4.0|I really was surprised that the 2nd book was able to keep me interested as much as the first.  However, I was a little disappointed for two reasons.  First, I was hoping the Author would have picked up EXACTLY where she left off in book 1.  I wanted to SEE the reunion between Katniss and her family...and Gale.  As a reader, I felt cheated that we didn't get to \\"experience\\" it, we were only \\"told\\" about it.  Second, I didn't like that they had to participate in an additional Hunger Games...but it was ok.  Seemed somewhat \\"been there, done that\\".  Those two complaints aside, I really enjoyed book 2 and cannot wait until Book 3 hits the shelves!
B002SF9YUM|4.0|My girlfriends and I drove over four hours away to see this movie in San Francisco when it played in the theatres.  We weren't expecting much simply because this was a low-budget independent movie not getting much attention/buzz.  So, how great to find a gem of a story and captivating acting by the two leads.    The movie is beautifully shot, the colors are magnificent and the story is one you are compelled to hear with an ending scene that will break your heart.      The acting of Pattinson at times can seem awkward, as he has much growing as an actor to do, but he delivers an appropriately weird and uncomfortable performance as Dali.  His performance, unlike those of just plain old bad actors, is anything but boring, and one can only wonder what Pattinson may be capable of with more experience.    And Beltrain as Lorca is hard to take your eyes off of.  He has an ease and sincerity to his delivery that never falters, and you'll wish he'd never stop talking let alone leave the screen!    This movie is worth watching.  You'll be thinking about it long after the credits have stopped rolling.
0385341008|5.0|A friend gave me this book and I immediately fell in love with Juliet.  It didn't take long to fall in love with the rest of the characters in this story.  I have always enjoyed writing letters myself and found this story telling format to be so engaging.  I have read the book twice and have purchased several copies to share with friends.  I only hope there will be a sequel!
B002VECM40|3.0|Two absolutely blistering performances make PRECIOUS a must-see movie...despite many other flaws.  In fact, were it not for the work of Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique, I would probably not recommend the film.    PRECIOUS plays something like the most brutal, graphic Afterschool Special you could imagine.  It tells the story of 16-year-old Precious, a morbidly obese girl who is already the mother of one child (with Down Syndrome) and another on the way.  Both children were fathered by HER father.  She lives with her mother, Mary...the most frightening, abuse, foul-mouthed and dark-hearted mother since...well, I can't remember when.  Precious gets a chance to enroll in an alternative school, and through the kindness of her new teacher and the support of some new friends, Precious begins to blossom a bit.  She tries to tear away from her mother, gain enough confidence in herself and be a good mother for her kids.    This is all set against some of the most squalid living conditions we've ever seen that take place in America.  Precious and Mary live in a cramped apartment, funding purely by welfare checks.  Mary, in fact, rarely ventures beyond the walls of her apartment.  She stews in front of the TV, awash in bile and anger...waiting for Precious to come home from school to cook her dinner and bear the brunt of her wrath.  Even the alternative school Precious attends is in a run down apartment building that anyone would be afraid to send their child to.      While the movie is full of shocking moments (none more than the frequent outbursts of violence from Mary), the story still plays out VERY predictably.  Precious just needs a little confidence and love to start blossoming.  Education will save her.  Her classmates are a generically wacky bunch of troubled teens...really just all good kids on the inside.  Her teacher seems to literally glow with goodness (and she's a lesbian in a healthy, loving relationship).  Her welfare caseworker is tough but fair.  When she goesinto labor, her male nurse is a handsome, sensitive hunk.  Even the daydreams Precious has (sadly, mostly when she's being raped or pushed around) seem generic...dreams of stardom and flashy clothes.      I don't mean to demean the plight of Precious and people like her.  Despite my seeming cynicism, there were still many moments of power in the film that had me gasping or shaking my head in utter disbelief.  But so much of the \\"bad things\\" that happened in the film seemed generic, and most of the minor characters suffered from that as well.  They were one-dimensional, stock characters.  Imagine the kids from WELCOME BACK KOTTER if they could curse like crazy.    The direction of Lee Daniels is very vague as well.  He sometimes doesn't have a good grip on the way people are related to each other in a space.  Some of the scenes have an almost documentary style (probably right for this story), but others have fanciful camera angles, soft focus and unnecessary trickery...to remind us we're seeing a film.      But what Daniels has managed to do well is hardly insignificant.  He's assembled a cast that clearly feels VERY strongly about the material, and most of them handle their assignments well.  Paula Patton plays the teacher fairly well, although Daniels insists on keeping her in a soft focus that reminded me of nothing more than the way William Shatner's Captain Kirk so often had a glow to him on TV.  Her character was written to be something close to a saint...far too generic.  But Patton does well with what she has.  Mariah Carey (star of GLITTER!) is more than credible as Mrs. Weiss, the welfare case worker.  She has just a few scenes, and she handles all of them in an admirably understated way.  She isn't really a character but a device...yet we see glimpses of who this lady might be.   She has humor and toughness in a combination I wouldn't have expected Carey to be able to pull off.  I have to give credit where it is due.    Gabourey Sidibe is a newcomer to acting, but she is SO convincing as Precious, you can forgive those audience members who have apparently thought this film was someone autobiographical.  I know NOTHING about this young lady...but she certainly gives us a fully realized portrayal.  She has no gloss to her at all.  Sometimes she mumbles and is difficult to understand...JUST LIKE many teenagers I know!  She is capable of great self-pity (certainly earned) but also great charm.  We can palpably feel Precious trying to claw her way into a better life.  The odds are stacked against her (there are even more roadblocks I haven't spoiled for you)...but she is able to envision herself providing love and care to her kids.    However, it is Mo'Nique who is a virtual lock for an Oscar-nomination.  She is a shockingly horrible mother and human being.  To say she is full of anger is a major understatement.  While her part is written in a cardboard fashion (she's almost like an inner-city wicked stepmother from a fairy tale)...the actress elevates every moment on screen.  She is riveting to watch because you literally don't know what she'll do next...except you know it'll be horrible.  Her every utterance is filled with animal cunning, and I mean that.  She is a deeply unintelligent and uneducated woman who has a survival instinct that is terrifying.  And she would gladly sacrifice anyone or anything.  She is a creature utterly without dignity and utterly without redeeming qualities.  She knows this, and wears it as a warped badge of honor.  All of this would have been good enough to burn this performance in my memory...but Mo'Nique's final scene, where she bares her dark soul and her motivation takes this to another level.  I felt all the air sucked out of the theatre as we collectively gasped in disbelief at the depths of delusion and loathing this character operated under.    For these two performances, PRECIOUS is well-worth seeing.  And you may find yourself falling more under the spell of the film overall thanI did...in which case, you'll find this one of the year's best films.  For me, it is an interesting failure...made compelling by two of the best performances I've seen this year.
0385504225|3.0|An in depth overview of secret societies rendering them immature and cultish. That part is good, however, Mr. Brown loves intensity and overdoes drama without true character development. No one really cares what happens to anyone of them, and in a movie, play, or book, I like to be able to identify with at least someone.
B001PR0YDA|5.0|We went to the movies the other night and all of us agreed this was by far the finest adaptation of A Christmas Carol since George C. Scott played the well known old grump so many years ago.  The animation was incredible.  The characters were played so perfectly (what an all star cast!) and what I also loved is that they stayed true to the original text.  So many remakes tend to take liberties, but even Charles Dickens would be proud of this great achievement.  Bravo, Disney!  We can't wait to have it on DVD.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones is well suited to the role of a detective tracking down grisly murderers in the Bayou. Confederate ghosts haunt him as he searches for answers not only to the prostitues being murdered currently, but the forty year old case that he dredges up as well.

If you enjoy murder mysteries I suggest you at least rent this one. Good quality picture and sound with some great scenery in the New Orleans area post Katrina. Decent replayability.

0786838655|5.0|Rick Riordan, a young adult author, is quickly becoming a god figuratively speaking.  After the release of his novel The Lightning Thief in June of 2005, Riordan is quickly becoming well known because of his young adult series Percy Jackson and the Olympians.  This series is quickly becoming one of the newest young adult fads because of the interesting way the novels include facts about Greek mythology without being dull or unoriginal.     One of the attention grabbers Riordan uses is his characters who allow the reader to quickly become absorbed in the book.  The first character introduced is Percy Jackson, a twelve year old boy diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia who seems to have extreme difficulty staying out of trouble and in a school district.  Riordan helps the reader to understand Jackson better by introducing his mom to the reader, as Jackson's father is mysteriously out of the picture.  Jackson's life is quickly turned upside down after a trip to the coast with his mother.   Some of the other characters readers quickly gain affection for are Annabeth, the lonely girl who lives at summer camp; Grover, Jackson's best friend who seems unnaturally nervous; Chiron, Jackson's teacher who has unnaturally high expectations for him; and Luke, the friendly camp counselor with a mysterious scar on his face.     This series appeals to many readers, not just young adults.  The appeal for these novels is that it introduces Greek mythology in a way that is interesting and fun, putting their experiences in the present time while still being correct.   Also, the books allow for the reader to understand what the characters are going through by using dream sequences to show how they feel about situations.  The most important appeal that Riordan uses is the fact that the characters in his books are still going through the adolescent changes that every person went through in life.  The characters deal with everything from understanding their parents and teachers to trying to figure out what that girl over there is thinking.   While the writing style of these novels may not be up to Dante's standards, it is simple enough for children to be comfortable reading while still allowing adults to be entertained as well.  One of the best parts of the novels is the fact that the series leads seamlessly from one book to the next.  All of the books have flawless transitions, allowing the reader to quickly move through the series without confusion.     The most important part of this series is the fact that they are education without the reader knowing it.  The Greek facts are included in a way that does not allow the reader to realize they are learning something, while reading questions are found in the back of the book to provoke thought.  Also the novels help to promote morals for children and adults alike, teaching them to stand up for themselves and what is right and wrong.  Riordan has stumbled upon a creative way to teach children about the history intertwined in our present while enthralling adults as well.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This headset was a birthday gift from my wife.  Although it was on my wish list, I wasn't going to buy it for myself.  I'm very picky about sound quality and I couldn't believe that this headset could replace my surround sound system.  Much to my surprise, now, I rarely use the home theater system while gaming.  The environment that these headphones creates is unbelievable. Although I have had no issues with the headset, by looking at the reviews, some people have.  Today, I found the forum on the manufacture's site and  I am further impressed with their quick response to problems.
B00111YM5G|4.0|Growing up as a Catholic, one is taught of the realm known as Purgatory to be something of a neutral holding tank for the departed earth souls awaiting their final destination in either Heaven or Hell.  Beyond that, not much of Purgatory has been mentioned in my personal Catholic back round.  A Jewish friend of mine has described a similar place (of his teachings) as respite, a place of healing, for souls to recover in, before moving on.  So, it was interesting to see the point of balance of this realm shifted to such a dark and heavy force. I found the parallels between this Purgatory and our own earth realm very interesting to wrestle with through out the film.  'Gabriel' presents the dark night of the human soul so very acutely with all of it's repulsive splendor even unto the Angels sent to deliver this place, and the inhabitants thereof, unto the hands of a light and benevolent God of which they represent.  This place, \\"...where even Angels fear to tread\\" depicts the thick, intense, struggles with the seven deadly sins of the flesh and the forces of light under fire by the fallen angels near complete in their control.  To see the Arch's (Archangels) succumb, one by one, to the starless landscape is of some comfort and yet abominable simultaneously.  For if the highest and strongest of the Angelic realm struggle so in the dark - then is it no wonder how the human spirit can also become so wretched?      'Gabriel' is no \\"chicken soup for soul\\", but certainly good food for thought.  It was unexpectedly well acted with a cast of unknowns battling light against dark in very effective cinematography noir, portraying gritty action sequences, interspersed with some very poignant insights gleaming from the shadows.  You may, or may not, feel delivered by this story, but I felt it certainly delivers.  This film was an unlikely, unexpected gem in the rough for me.  I purchased the DVD for myself and a few more for gifts.
045122499X|4.0|As many others, I read POTE and liked it. This book, although I can't deny its merits, is worse. It is a tale of  wide scope, encompassing lives of many people through almost half a century. The book has some vivid descriptions, memorable scenes (especially the closing scene), other things, typical of Follett. At the same time this book has some drawbacks wich make it a less fascinating and sometimes even boring read. I had an impression it had not been edited properly or the author had tried to do his best to make the book as long as possible.<br />1. WWE is full of tedious repetitions (for example, we are told that Thomas Langley had been a knight in the past on pages 68, 93, 138, that his arm had been amputated on pp. 68, 93, 258, let alone times when someone sees a one-handed person and guesses it must be Thomas Langley; Saul Whitehead is the prior of St. John-in-the-Forest - pp. 86, 238, the author tells us three times that monks in that cell produce good cheese, twice that the weight of a sackful of wool is 364 pounds and so on). If Follett had mentioned those facts only once, it would have been enough to remember.<br />2. The auhor gives a lot of information about things which have no bearing on the story itself, but only make the book longer (for example, a detailed description of how a loom worked). I never realized why he needed to tell the story of how Ralph's patrents met and got married (and it was a very hackneyed one).<br />3. Characters in WWE are weaker than in POTE and behave in a very modern way. I was at a loss to understand why the positive characters of the book commited some morally disgusting acts, and therefore never cared much about their fate.<br />4. The plot has some loose threads which the auhor may have wanted to develop, but for some reason never did it.<br />In spite of all this problems, WWE is an entertaining book. I am not sorry I've read it, and plan to read Follett's next book.

0440242401|4.0|This was my favorite of Kinsella's books, for a strange reason.  I liked that there was something real, and serious about it.  Of course, there were LOTS of hilarious moments.  But Lexi, overall, was struggling to get through life, through serious difficulties, and come out on top, and happy.  While the amnesia may have been a hard pill to swallow, I was glad that Kinsella included work and personal problems that could not just be laughed away.  That made the book more appealing than Shopaholic for me -- where I simply cannot relate!  Also, the ending was not all neat and tidy, which I also deeply appreciate.      Bottom line -- even if you don't like the whole Shopaholic series (if you, like me, had to stop after the second book) you may enjoy this one. Reminded me of Jennifer Weiner, which is a good thing.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I watched a couple of episodes when the program aired, but since they were out of sequence, couldn't quite figure out what was going on, main themes, etc. But, it seemed to have potential so I got the DVD.<br /><br />While the series lags a bit after a decent pilot, it builds quite well. Very engrossing, and it's good to see some familiar faces from The Wire (one of my all-time favorite shows). Generally good acting, but it took me a while to appreciate Anna Torv. In contrast, took an instant shine to the character of Walter Bishop (played by John Nobel) -- very entertaining and well played.<br /><br />The comparison to the X-Files is inevitable, and The Fringe certainly borrows quite a few structural elements from it. But, it also moves in some new directions as well - well worth viewing regardless if you liked or didn't care for the X Files.
B002JODV3S|5.0|Steve really did something different with this tour and this show. Yes, you can expect the usual amazing guitar work, but what's going to take you by suprise is how Steve really brings the whole band into the spotlight on this DVD. It's really more like a \\"band\\" video than a \\"guitar virtuoso\\" video. All of the musicians are brought into the spotlight, and the addition of violins / keys / freaky drum packs / etc... are really incredible. If you were to just put this DVD on at a party without making a big deal out of it or telling anyone who it was, within 20 minutes everyone will just be gawking at the amazing musicianship on the part of every player, not to mention the beautiful soaring violin peaces and various instrumental duels. ABSOLUTELY GET THIS!

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Simply put, Lady Gaga's The Fame Monster is magnificent.  Gaga returns with an 8-track EP that serves as a companion to her debut album, The Fame.  However, the songs on The Fame Monster sound less like last-minute additions to an existing album and more like what you'd find on an entirely new album.  The music sound more evolved from those on The Fame, featuring improved production and more mature vocals.  You almost have to wonder why she didn't just include 2-4 more songs and make it a full release!  As for the songs themselves, they are career-defining pop anthems that will rule the airwaves!  We've already heard the fierceness that is &#34;Bad Romance&#34;.  The supposed next single, &#34;Telephone&#34; which features Beyonce, will be a huge single.  Also notable is &#34;Alejandro&#34; (which sounds like another hit single) and &#34;Monster&#34;.  This album is just infectious in every sense of the word.  I have not been able to stop listening to it over and over.  It further shows that Lady Gaga is an enormous force in the pop music scene.   UPDATE:  I recently re-purchased this album, this time on vinyl.  The only official version of this EP on vinyl is, most unfortunately, a picture disc.  As such you'll be treated to the same flat sound that plagues all picture disc releases.  It's really too bad, since the album itself is so great.  But seriously, stick to CD or digital for the best sound.

B00000DRW0|4.0|I went out of my way to get the original David Bowie mix of this album after wanting to hear the original version and being a bit scared off of the Iggy Pop release of a few years back due to negative reviewer comments, on boards like this. It seems that the Bowie mix is being remastered and released early next year, which may resolve some of the issues I had with the sound quality on this cd. The cd I have is dates stamped \\"1973\\", even though cds weren't released back then, so hopefully everything is kosher, so to speak, in any case. This review is attached to the cd I bought from this site in any case. Unfortunately Amazon describes different versions of this album as being the Iggy re-mix, and the reviewers' comments are not sorted according to which cd they have (Bowie or Pop). One other thing to note, there is a release called \\"Iggy Pop & The Stooges: Raw power\\" which is NOT the album people mean when they name that title. That variation has a different track listing, with some overlap of content, but the material is basically demo quality with out-takes included. Beware of that bit of deception...some of the tracks on that demo aren't bad, but sound quality is worse than the cd I'm reviewing now.       Anyway, for the actual album, the sound quality is variable, like I've said...it improves on the second half of the album, for the most part.  The first half songs generally lack presence/immediacy. It's a pity the entire album isn't more in line with the sound quality of the second half of it.  As for the music,  I'd call a lot of it \\"groove rock\\"...overlapping with heavy metal times.  \\"Fun house\\", with it's second side of jazz rock may have alienated some listeners,  but with Raw Power, I think it has a more honed groove...less self-indulgent, perhaps. Overall, I like this album for its listenability. I'm giving it roughly 80/100, but around 75/100 with some wriggle room seems fair.  The Stooges are a consistent band...haven't really loved anything of theirs, but haven't hated anything of theirs either. This title lacks songs which are as good as some of those on their self-titled debut, but they don't fill half an album with themselves jamming, as they do for their follow up album \\"Fun house\\".        Best songs (took two listens to put these two tracks ahead of anything else):        I need somebody - a bluesy, mid-tempo song with pleasant, accoustic guitar note picking. I like the bluesy riff this track has. Chorus has a catchy melody. Electric guitar also features and the tone of the drum sounds odd later on, in the right hand side of the speaker.    Death trip - has a good, choppy riff, but the song lacks presence. However, the lead guitar does sound bright/harsh...it cuts through with its piercing tone. Song seems to have a cello type instrument in it.  In my reviews of earlier Stooges albums I have remarked on how they draw on The Doors for their songs...this is another great illustration of that...this song is pure \\"L.A.woman\\" in form and style.        Next  best song:        Gimme danger - has a nice sounding steel stringed accoustic guitar, I think, and the tinkling on the keyboard sounds nice too.  Lyrically, this song seems to have some overlapping themes with their Black Sabbath sounding \\"I wanna be your dog\\" from their debut album...talk of wanting a \\"master\\", for instance. Electric guitar also features. Another example of Iggy Pop drawing upon The Doors' Jim Morrison's approach to singing/performance.  Slower tempo track.          The rest:        Search and destroy - rhythm guitar is in the background here but the lead guitar is more upfront (part of the sound quality issue that I am raising).  The guitar actually seems to drift in out of focus sometimes, which I don't think is intended.  Drums sound tinny but Iggy's vocal level is fine...a sign of narcissism or something?     Your pretty face is going to Hell - strikes me as a boogie hard rock type of track...bit punk rock too, with a heavy metal type lead guitar...sort of ball park ZZ Top in style.  Another track with an odd tone for the drum on the right hand side.    Penetration - a mid tempo bluesy rock vibe with a bluesy lyrical style sometimes.  There is a spacey effect on the vocals (this seems intended...perhaps they were trying to do this too on those drum parts I've mentioned earlier?). Keyboards in the background sound nice...it's a pity that they aren't more in the foreground.  The sound is sort of ok but has a middling level which lacks presence (The Sex Pistols had that sort of middling level too, I think, but the production quality was higher. Ramones \\"Leave home\\" really sorted out the levels which dogged their debut...well, on my cd, which has bonus tracks on it, the levels are way better than on their debut).     Raw power - the 5th track on this album and has the best sound quality to that point. The rhythm guitar has a clean sound which is upfront. Another good track for the piano...it has a glassy kind of sound and its level is better than on other tracks which have a keyboard.  The piano part is cool in any case...maybe similar to what they did in \\"I wanna be your dog\\".    Shake appeal - has a sort of boogie riff to it with a good sounding guitar. Features handclaps with some interesting and fast drumming, at times. Guitars have an interesting sound to them. One guitar part sounds quite garagey...bright and harsh.        Recommendations:        (proto -punk)    The New York Dolls - The New York Dolls    (punk)    Stiff Little Fingers - Inflammable material    The Sex Pistols - Never mind the bollocks    Radio Birdman - Radios appear (influenced by The Stooges)    The Saints - (I'm) Stranded    Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers - L.A.M.F.    (rock)    The Doors - greatest hits or some such.    AC/DC - Let there be rock (pub rock)

Also, this is for the Blu-Ray version, but visually, is it top-notch. This IS demo material!
0061537969|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a perfect 10!    If you love dogs and racing, then you are in for a real treat.    Not only does Garth Stein perfectly characterize how you would think a dog would speak if he could, but he hits the nail on the head with every detail of this book.     I've purchased two copies myself (first copy at Starbucks and the second was at Borders).  One is for me to keep, and one is to lend out to my family members and every single one of my friends.    Add it to your Holiday list for all of your friends, they will be VERY greatful.    Garth, I really hope theirs a follow up book!
1932100660|5.0|This book is not the kind I usually pick up...but it has changed my nutritional worldview like none other.  There are a few parts that are hard to get through for the average reader but the author certainly impressed me with his thorough research.  All of it makes so much sense and has inspired me to not only renew a commitment to eating vegetarian meals (which I already assumed were better for me) but has made me seriously begin working towards a vegan diet, something I previously thought was crazy and totally unnecessary.  An amazing book that all my overweight meat-eating friends and family members MUST read.

B00000F169|5.0|Dark Star is a 1974 science fiction classic, set in the distant future.    The story takes place upon a futuristic scout ship that goes exploring for unstable planets to blow up, so that these planets will not be accidentally colonized . They use intelligent Exponential Thermosteller Bombs and get into an argument with one , after an accident during an asteroid storm. The crew members are hilarious !  It is very funny , in a dark humor sort of way.   This DVD comes with the theatrical version and the Special Edition, which is about 15 minutes shorter than the version the producer, Jack Harris,insisted that John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon add to the film before releasing it to the theaters through Bryanston Pictures. The special Edition is a better quality recording that removes the added 15 minutes.   I highly recommend these films to fans of science Fiction and Comedy, alike. Out of production, this DVD is becoming difficult to obtain, so get it if you can. I'm glad that I found my copy. I can understand why it is considered a \\"cult classic\\" .
1569242739|5.0|I love to bake, I am not a vegan, but I bake for those in the family that are. At my grandaughter's birthday party, they could not get over the fact that they were actually vanilla vegan cupcakes, they tasted exactly like my normal vanilla dairy cupcakes. The icing was even the same consistency. The chocolate chip pumpkin cupcakes with the cinnamon icing are so moist, I made those for Thanksgiving. This book is amazing! I will be buying the cookie book this week to bake with my grandaugher.
B00005UT85|4.0|This is not the progressive rock of Caravan's [[ASIN:B00005A0V0 In the Land of Grey and Pink]] or[[ASIN:B00005A46U If I Could Do It All Over Again I'd Do It All Over You]].<br /><br />Then again, in 1969, prog as we know it was just being hatched, so bands like Caravan were just playing their organs, trying to sketch a new genre the shape of which they did not know.<br /><br />But on its own terms, this is a great album, and basically, a churchy, organ album. Of all the Cantaberry bands--Soft Machine, Henry Cow-Caravan made music as happy if not happier. So although you get a lot of gothic sounding organ, you won't get that dark flavor of, say, those David Axelrod produced Electric Prunes albums like [[ASIN:B00004W3KS Mass in F Minor]] or[[ASIN:B000I8OMR6 Release of an Oath]].<br /><br />But the melodic playing, particularly on the latin-tinged \\"Love Song With Flute\\" show this band was set on their toes, more than ready to sprint into uncharted musical turf.<br /><br />The album is done twice here, in mono and stereo, and although we associate progressive rock with stereo, the bold organ here works in clean mono just beautifuly.<br /><br />This may not be the Caravan you know, and may not be the place to start, but  while waiting for art rock to come out of utero, Caravan sure made one terrific debut.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Review no. 415. Can't believe there are this many fan reviews of this title. Band's second full length CD, as I noticed the lyrics would often jump from Spanish to English. Tracks I was most impressed with were the four-part thirteen-minute \\"Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus\\" - featuring some classy guitar work from Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and the 32 minute five-part \\"Cassandra Gemini\\" that has plenty of changes. It's been noted that \\"The Widow\\" and \\"Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" is more like elaborite poems - I just didn't see it, however I must admit that especially on this title of theirs - I have sort of a tough time 'fully' understanding this brilliance. Some patrons, including myself would likely find this disc a bit too complex - still quite a good find, don't get me wrong. Even more amazing, 'Frances The Mute' reportedly sold close to a half-a-million copies. Not bad for an up and coming band of this particular genre.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|As if there were further evidence needed of the magic of the Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour  provides it perfectly<br /><br />This was not cut as a proper Beatles album. The band took the tracks from the film, and added their 1967 singles. For many bands, this would be a patchwork, but Magical Mystery Tour is as coeasive as any Beatles album.<br /><br />And packed with invention. Listen to \\"I Am The Walrus,\\" \\"Penny Lane,\\" any of the tracks, and you get futher, even more fleshed out extentions of the experiments that started on Sgt. Pepper. Even an offhand jam like \\"Flying\\" is marvalous--so much so very early FM djs used it to talk over. If a novality band had put \\"Flying\\" out as a psych/blues single, it would still be known today.<br /><br />I am not the first to say,  but a throwaway by the Beatles is better than 99% of music available.
B002R68U7K|5.0|I have received my order. My, my what a beautiful black box with all the singles plus B-sides and fantastic remixes all tucked nicely. All the singles' covers are<br />adorned with original artworks. Jive Records really made this an extra special treat worth more, with its glossy booklet which charted every details of each singles with gorgeous pictures complete with a dvd showcasing the best of Britney Spears' music videos. A steal for a limited edition box set.<br /><br />For that certain Girls Aloud fan, please shut up for this is a Britney Spears: The Singles Collection (Deluxe) reviews' page. Save your hatred for your own self.<br />If you do not love Britney's music, please, just go away. Restricted for Britney Spears' super fans. Peace!
B002UXRH10|4.0|Wow! I bought this CD on a whim after reading a review by Mike Ragogna on the Huffington Post. He said this was the album Rihanna needed to make, not an album the record label would have necessarily chosen for her to make. It almost sounds like it could have been recorded in 1980's Eastern Europe with so many heavy techno beats and crunchy synths and simmering industrial arrangements. Apparently Rihanna's Caribbean accent is more present on this album than her previous work. I'd never been drawn to Rihanna's earlier work so I can't qualify that assertion, but I think her accent works for her and I hope she continues to brandish it in her future work. If you are a fan of blended musical genres and artist experimentation and still enjoy popular music, this CD is a goldmine. Not a single dud track and it flows nicely. It may take a while for people to realize it, but this is going to end up being a landmark CD for Rihanna. It's an amazing piece of work by a young person so early in their career. I can't wait to see where she goes next in her sound. This is a young woman firmly in control of her music and her life.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Shipping was very fast and product met my expectations.  The only problem so far is that on dry days in certain clothing I have received a couple of ear shocks while the product was plugged directly into the treadmill (mild). Stays on your head and in your ears while running which was I bought these specific headphones.
B001F290E4|5.0|I got this CD and could not un-wrap it fast enough.  I love every song on the CD.  It's great soul music and very romantic.   I listen to it when I'm stressed out.  Got some great dance songs on it as well.  Very happy I made this purchase!
1400067936|4.0|I found this book to be quite an illuminating expose of sorts in the financial markets and of its (often varied and colorful!) participants. To a lesser extent, this is also an indictment of the role of luck and how it plays into our everyday lives. The book really doesn't go into specific theories (apart from discussing 'option blindness') on how to 'exploit' randomness in the financial markets for one's financial benefit, though. It could be perhaps that the book didn't intend to do so, other than to highlight the hidden dangers of risk and randomness in the financial markets.    I agree with some reviewers here that the tone of the book could have been written in a better way. And that the genesis of his ideas be compartmentalized in a more succinct manner. Hence, a 4-star rating.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|The acting is top form. Meryl Streep is amazing.     This movie is an exercise in subtlety, subtext and nuance - the film begs an intelligent audience, willing and ready to think for him or herself.     Be prepared to draw your own conclusions. You, as well as the actors, are players in this movie. You will have just as much information as the characters do at the end of this movie when the time to comes to make a decision about the one burning question that thrust this movie forward.     The dialogue is sharp and witty: no one ever directly answers the question posed to him or her. Responses are always oblique, which makes the movie intriguing, beguiling. You sort of look at it like an exotic plant you can't take your eyes off of.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I cannot believe how many people have never heard of this movie. Don't let that be you! A true masterpiece!
B002NXSRX4|2.0|This movie was hardly a script driven movie. Three fourths of the fun in watching it is remembering what it was like to play with the toys as a kid and how you always wanted to blow stuff up. The other fourth of the fun factor comes from seeing how hot Sienna Miller is in her outfits or watching Ray Park doing his thing as the GI Joe named Snake Eyes.<br /><br />Honestly, the acting is sub-par with Channing Tatum jumping his lines rather than saying them with any inflection(you could replace him with Ben Stein for the amount of voice monotone acting going on here). With Dennis Quaid sounding more like a barking dog than a military leader and Marlon Wayans trying to be smart/action packed while hitting on the smart Scarlett who could not look less of a soldier while running on a treadmill if she tried (just watch her hands, looks like a little girl running and is annoying). Sorry Rachel Nichols, you were obviously hired for the hair color and your rack, because your lines in the movie were bad. Then again I blame some of that on the script and the director.<br /><br />Worth the rental on DVD, I bought it on Blue ray for the special effects and the fact it was on sale.<br /><br />NOTE: This is not a Transformer style Toy to Movie success. (Most of it has to do with Cast/Script/Director)
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This reminds me of Spinal Tap, when, out of creative ideas, the band unveiled their thematic homage to Stonehenge, land of the druids.  Sting's project addressing \\"winter\\" is a bit overwrought...
044654146X|5.0|Senor and Singer tell thier important and instructive story of why Israel is the Start-Up Nation in an entertaining and compelling manner.  Told through a combination of intelligent, compelling narative, and interviews with the young nation's political and business leaders, entrepreuners all, it's a quick read that leaves the reader wanting more.  Other nations, large and small, have much to learn from the Israeli experience and Senor's and Singer's telling of this story.
B001AQO3WY|4.0|I was conflicted by the video. I think most Marines will understand the ways and means of this video but civilians won't understand anything but the action. For a former Marine It's hard to understand why there were so many screw ups but Rudy was there. I have a friend that personally knew most of the real guys in the video so he filled me in. Even though we rolled through Iraq so fast it wasn't pretty. I enjoy watching this a coup0le of times a year and instead of picking through some of the vid's I recorded now I have the series.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|The PS controllers are a little too small for my hands.  The PS3 Dual Triggers place the L2 and R2 buttons in a much more comfortable position.  I've been searching for a larger PS3 controller, but I think this product is a much cheaper solution.  Just be careful while playing FPS games that use L2/R2 for grenades.  My girlfriend's hands are normal sized and she likes the Dual Triggers too.
B00284BMBM|4.0|The message of \\"Leave This Town\\" is clear: Daughtry is a band, not a solo act. From the group photo on the cover, to the extensive credits in the booklet, to the overall ensemble feeling of the songs, this is indeed a group effort. Which is to Chris Daughtry's credit. He could have easily promoted himself as a solo artist, with a nameless backup band, as many artists do. Instead, he seems happy to share the spotlight with his newfound bandmates.<br /><br />The album is more musically diverse than the first Daughtry release, with a more acoustic feel on many tracks, and a less Nickelback-esque feeling overall. Chris seems more relaxed on this release, which is not to discount the first album's excellent rock vibe. This record just feels more natural and less like an American Idol album.<br /><br />Lead single \\"No Surprise\\" contains an extra verse on the album, which is seldom heard on radio. Follow-up single \\"Life After You\\" continues the newfound relaxed vibe, while the excellent \\"September\\" should prove itself as a future classic.<br /><br />So far, Daughtry appears to be a band in it for the long haul; indeed, a traditional American rock band, which is increasingly rare on today's charts full of R&B posers and Disney pop stars.
0316789798|5.0|My 7 year old daughter had used a similar book by the same author at her school for Halloween.  She asked if we could get another one of Ed Emberley's books and we picked the animals book.  She was able to draw really great pictures of animals very easily, on her own.  I highly recommend.
1587613379|2.0|The authors write in an annoying self-help style. The book is fine if you have never thought about things on your own and need spoon feeding. I had to skip most of it.
B002MW50KO|4.0|The last thing we ever thought Bob would do (which is probably why he did it)and even more as a big Dylan fan I still thought this could be lame. It just isn't. He isn't even trying to reinvent these tunes- they are pretty traditional versions but it just works. I never thought of Bob as a crooner and I'm not sure I do now but this is a good Christmas album in fact it's just a good album. Well done Bob and Merry Christmas to ya for it!
B00004VVND|5.0|This was a very suspenseful movie. Basically, this film is about a futuristic amusement park called Westworld where people can enjoy living in the wildwest. Westworld is inhabited by android robots where visitors can have a shoot-out with them, have a talk with them, and even have sex with them. But when the androids start to malfunction, all hell breaks loose as the unstopable androids start to kill their human guests. Highly suspenseful, good acting and directed, and good special effects. Highly recommended!
044024367X|1.0|I couldn't even finish it. I think the Reacher series is the best series I have read in years but don't bother with this one...predictable and I would say insulting to current and former members of the US armed forces.
B0024FAR5M|3.0|good service from amazon. dvd was less than i expected. i had already seen parts of season 1 this year , season 2. don't get me wrong i love the series !
B00138EZCM|5.0|A friend recommended this to me. Never really listened to Jeff Buckley before, but I am now a huge fan. Definitely get the Legacy Edition. A beautiful album packed with so much emotion...a new favorite in my collection.
0786868724|5.0|While a book for any time this book about faith and hope is perfect for the times we are living in. As always Albom communicates a simple message in a few pages which the \\"experts\\" and the \\"learned\\" can never convey in hundreds of pages precisely because faith and hope need little clarifcation and no justification but simply some living examples.
B001F290E4|4.0|Seal has a great voice he knows how to sing the right note,i love this cd.
0393061310|5.0|One of the best works of non-fiction I have read. The breadth of the author is staggering: anthropology, history, genetics, linguistics, biology, climatology, geology, sociology, and other fields I don't know the names for. All of these disparate yet interrelated fields are woven into a single narrative about the ultimate reasons behind the radically different developmental paths taken by the worlds civilizations. A plausible, scientifically-based explanation of issues I have contemplated for years, which simultaneously deconstructs the commonly held theory that genetics had a role in the advancement (or not) of peoples. The author explains why native Tasmanians never left the stone age (and indeed reverted to so-called inferior technologies), how Great Britain became a world power, why the native cultures in pre-Colonial North America were technologically moribund and not only illiterate but making no progress towards the development of written language, and how that same North American continent then came to house the most advanced civilization in the history of human kind (my assessment of America, not his). A must-read for anyone who has ever pondered the great question of human history and pre-history.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|This is good.  But we really wanted the AMERICAN version narrated by Signourney Weaver as was shown on TV.  We have found that we can buy the AMERICAN version from Discovery.  So, we have given away the FOREIGN version, the only one that Amazon sells, and have purchased the AMERICAN version from Discovery.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|Cute family movie. The whole family laughed through this movie. Lots of the same characters with a few extra that bring more laughs.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|All I have to say that all the items I've purchased through Amazon have been Amazing.  They are the best and have a wonderful team of customer service.    Since snow white is my favorite of all Disney movies I have purchased a sony blu ray and the movie as a christmas present for my grandchildren.    I thank you and I can't wait to see their faces on christmas.
B002UZCJP2|3.0|An okay movie. It could have been better. The acting was fine but it is definitely NOT a family movie.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|It's good to periodically reconsider an artist's relative vision/output, however 'pre-conscious' the very best of the same may be. Well beyond the obsessive marketing or 'philosophizing,' one may periodically find surprises as magical as they are real. The great artist's more fantastical senses of self - and the lesser work that flows from these - can indeed encourage comparisons to the docu-spoofery world of, say, Spinal Tap, in their druidic phase. But the critical sensibility forged mainly through disappointment at the relentless dance of big business and self-worship will tend to miss the best artistic moments -when/where they emerge.   This Christmas, there are yet 'Goods' to celebrate; the Sting 'Winter' record is one. The pop genius here channels the spirited English winter, complete with the far-reaching glow of its great Mass. Filtered partly by the forest's and the heart's darker aspect, this light further meanders in the form of wonder, toward something as forgotten as it is compelling: the sound of reverential longing. The quiet, snow-dampened path that is breathed and wandered here suggests a haunting that, in a sense, is itself haunted. This realistic light entails shadow but its engaged darks gradually flicker. Among the snows and grogs - in the very humblest of pleas and in personal visions that threaten to transfigure into caring identification - tacit Nativities arise. Wonder's acute interpretation resonates texts, harmonies, scenes, characters, and tambres so as to free them from numbing quaintness or mere Romantic magic. Though my reading may cross the intentionalism of his own market-strategic characterizations, the Renaissance [police]man and his merry gentle-persons seem to have engaged something of the season's core - its peculiarly real and loving magic. The album's uncanny discernment - of melody, sentiment, lyric, classical quotation, voice-leading, orchestration, performer, ensemble, performance, and engineering constitutes a uniquely beautiful allegory, at very least. It often sounds like the wise, giving and receiving Good gifts. Hark, is that Gabriel's harmon-muted horn on the first cut? And who on earth is this ripe man, wrapped in swaddling shreds and pleading for a 'soul cake'?!

B0000025T6|5.0|A record produced during my childhood, a collection of silly songs, was called \\"Dumb Ditties.\\" Bruce Springsteen's \\"Nebraska\\" is the polar opposite. A hot, dark, steaming platter of American wreckage stew is what The Boss serves up in \\"Nebraska.\\" These songs are True Gritties.   Economic and social decay are the backdrop for this 1982 classic. None of the songs corporate radio considers Springsteen's \\"greatest hits\\" are on \\"Nebraska,\\" making it all the more interesting for music fans and social critics.   The title track will never be played at a Cornhusker halftime show. Neoconservatives tried to impress \\"Born in the USA\\" into their perpetual warfare state, annoying Bruce, but there's no way that could happen with \\"Nebraska.\\" Gov./Sen. Bob Kerrey might appreciate the song but chamber of commerce types are sure to drive on by.   \\"Nebraska\\" the song's final line - \\"Well sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world\\" - attracted me to the CD and I'm pleased, though disturbed, that I stopped.   \\"Atlantic City\\" brims with earth and recession. The gambler's mindset and the desire to get it all back at once pour forth. \\"Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact. But maybe everything that dies some day comes back. Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and meet me tonight in Atlantic City.\\"   The winners and losers of \\"Atlantic City\\" linger in the haunting \\"Mansion on the Hill.\\" The starkness jars us as Bruce sings \\"In the day you can see the children playing on the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel.\\" And how's this for contrast? - \\"Tonight down here in Linden Town I watch the cars rushin' by home from the mill. There's a beautiful moon rising above the mansion on the hill.\\" Damn good, I say.   \\"Johnny 99\\" reminds us of the interconnectedness of everything and with that the inevitable limits of the criminal justice system. For more on interconnectedness notice the lack of punctuation in the CD's jacket notes. Our artist is telling us that nothing is ever truly separated off from other occurrences.   \\"Highway Patrolman\\" is poignant poetry about the thin blue line. In \\"State Trooper,\\" Springsteen makes a clever introduction of electric guitar in creating the accelerating bodily functions (pulse/heartbeat) of a nighttime motor vehicle stop. He does the trick again in \\"Used Cars,\\" using opening guitar chords that remind us of \\"Pink Cadillac\\" and \\"Cadillac Ranch.\\"   \\"Nebraska\\" the CD is much about Springsteen's native New Jersey. But with his choice of title the artist is telling us this collection is more than just about his home state. It's hard Americana with no brand or ZIP code.   Springsteen is thoroughly in the universal with \\"My Father's House.\\" This comparison of religious idealism with the organized version du jour is arguably the CD's best piece (it's my favorite, any way). This individual soul wandering foreshadows the couple version of \\"Secret Garden.\\" Bruce well summarizes the challenge of faith - \\"My father's house shines hard and bright. It stands like a beacon calling me in the night. Calling and calling so cold and alone. Shining across this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned.\\"   The artist detours back to Jersey to close the CD with \\"Reason to Believe.\\" But like the Kansas of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" the map names aren't what's important. What's crucial is one's mental and spiritual state. Springsteen gets as close to boosterism as he's ever likely to get in his music when marveling at the ability of people to have faith against reason. The Boss should know that the biblical patriarch Abraham, through nearly sacrificing son Isaac (Muslims say Ishmael was the offering), became the father of faith in this way. It's a gift to the human race that the race is still unwrapping. Springsteen is understandably anxious as the wrapping paper remains mostly in place centuries later - \\"Tell us what does it mean. At the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe.\\"

B0026P3G12|2.0|I really wanted to like this album; who wouldn't root for Susan Boyle?  But, the music verges on painful.  Each note is drawn out so much longer than it should be and while she can certainly hold a tune, she's not as good as any first-time Broadway artist.  You can hear her lack of formal training in every phrase she sings.  Good for her that she's become a star -- I don't think, however that I want to fund that stardom in the future.

B0017ANAZO|3.0|So this comedy carries a chick flick to the feminist end:<br />there are actually no male actors. We only see the men as reflected<br />in their effects on the lives of the women.<br />You think that the friends are going to attack<br />the other woman at her perfume counter.<br />Solidarity breaks down when the magazine editors confirms<br />the break up to a gossip columnist.<br />The lesbian played by Jada Pinkett Smith is an accepted one of the friends<br />so that moral or religious superiority is also lost<br />by these defenders of the middle class womanhood.<br />I'm a long time Meg Ryan fan, so I enjoyed the movie,<br />but I can't say this is a high point for western culture.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|I'm late coming to the Mamma Mia soundtrack because I have the London cast album. But after seeing the movie a gazillion times and loving it to bits, I decided to spring for the soundtrack because, let's face it, Meryl Streep and the movie cast lift this collection of fun songs to the realm of art. At least Streep's songs do.    So I was really disappointed that the album producers have opted to make the movie soundtrack sound like an ABBA album, minimizing the soloists' voices on Chiquitita and Dancing Queen almost out of existence.     With the exception of Streep's tracks, especially the great Winner Takes It All, you'd do just as well buying ABBA Gold and making your own Mamma Mia soundtrack.
B001SN78JO|3.0|This seems like a romantic comedy with a feel good message<br />by Jim Carey with his rent a new female star per movie program?<br />No one sane can possible say yes to everything?<br />It sounds like a perfect way to end up<br />in real big trouble, not with a job promotion,<br />or a new pretty but dumb girl friend....<br />So this guy's life degenerates to near chaos,<br />and he jumps off a bridge ( bungee).<br />He goes from a lonely loser to a fellow with too many phony friends?<br />Turning you life around and getting a second chance<br />at love is not going to happen to everybody<br />even if they do say yes.<br />The movie is a light comedy<br />and the acting is mostly light weight as well:<br />an LA fluff movie.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I hate Christmas pop - it's vile, loathesome stuff. Elvis was the last person to do anything worthy in that genre. So what does old man Bob do - he turns back the clock to the 40s and 50s and comes up with his best album since Love & Theft and the only Christmas album I'll ever need. Amazing, miraculous - the first time I listened to it, I just grinned through the whole album. It actually put me in the Christmas spirit... in October. So I put it away until Thanksgiving (anything Christmas before Thanksgiving is just wrong), and since the turkey got cooked, I've had this on continuous rotation. And I'm buying 3 more copies as gifts for friends and family.    Bless you, Bob - you really are something else.    (And all you 1 star reviews - what is wrong with you people???)
B002VECMA4|2.0|I had really high hopes for this movie. I love Clooney, Spacey, McGregor and Jeff Bridges. I had heard about 'remote viewing' when watching 'Suspect Zero'. I thought this would be a good movie and probably pretty funny cause I like a lot of what Clooney has done in the past. I must say it was just ok. It just kind of floundered and it is a shame cause with this much talent and such an interesting subject it could have been gold.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This album was worth the wait!  Each song is done with such great feeling and subtle background that enhances her voice rather than drowning it out.  I Dreamed A Dream gives me chills every time I listen.  One of the few albums I have ever purchased on which I like every song. I can't wait for her to do an album with cool jazz, and something with a bit more pep and power. She has breathtaking potential if the right persons assist her in selecting the tunes she can lift into greatness.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I have watched this movie about 10 times since I got it, and will proably watch it another 100 before I'm done.  It is such a great movie.  It has funny, laugh out loud scenes as well as poignant touching scenes that will bring a tear to even the strongest of people.  It is a movie that both children and adults will want to see over and over again. It will bring out the adult in a child and the child in an adult. A touching tale of a man keeping a promise of adventure to a woman he loved, after she dies.  You really love the characters and the story is so well done.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves adventure, romance, dogs, children, and heroes, because this movie has them all!
B001FB55HQ|4.0|When I heard that Christian Bale was starring in the newest TERMINATOR film, I flipped.  I mean, Bale's portrayal of Batman (or, rather, Bruce Wayne; I have qualms about his Batman voice, but that's another rant) helped rejuvenate the ailing franchise...hell, it brought it back from the grave.  I figured he could do the same for TERMINATOR as well, a series that started strong, became excellent, and then fizzled in the third entry.<br /><br />Well...SALVATION is much stronger than TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES.  However, Bale isn't given much to work with--his character, John Connor, wasn't even the principle character in the original script.  SALVATION rests squarely on the broad shoulders of Sam Worthington, who thankfully is an actor worthy of the challenge.  Worthington plays Marcus Wright, a death-row inmate given a second chance as one of SkyNet's failed human/cyborg composites.  However, the film wavers between Bale and Worthington's characters, primarily because the studio knows that ignoring a big-name star like Christian Bale is a big no-no.  Dare I say it: this movie would have been stronger without Bale's presence.  (I know, it's almost blasphemous; but it's the truth.)<br /><br />Also along for the ride is the talented Anton Yelchin (who also hit 2009 blockbuster gold in STAR TREK), as the guy who eventually goes back in time and sleeps with Connor's mother (look for voice cameos by Linda Hamilton).  We've also got a grossly under-used Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Ironside; Moon Bloodgood, who's a good fit for the role, although again there's not much to work with; and Bryce Dallas Howard, who doesn't quite mesh with the action stars she's surrounded with.  Add to that McG's uneven direction, and TERMINATOR: SALVATION comes off as another \\"what it should have been\\" film--not great, not spectacular, but entertaining enough to make up for RISE OF THE MACHINES.  Of course, that wouldn't take very much.  Also, let's face it: we would've loved a genuine Arnold cameo, his old age be damned.  Now THAT would have been true salvation.o, his old age be damned.  Now THAT would have been true salvation.

0312383320|3.0|Janet Evanovich has an imagination that defies description and I'm one of her biggest fans.  I know her books will be easy reading and take me to places I could barely imagine, with \\"plots\\" that are so nuts you rarely can tell what will happen next.  Personally, I wish she would stick with the numbers series and not spend her time with other characters who are not nearly as engaging as Stephanie and her weird assortment of relatives and co-workers.  Stephanie's attraction to both Joe Morelli and Ranger is perfectly understandable.  Each is sexy and different in their own way and I want to read more about them!  PLUM SPOOKY was fun to read if you don't try to take anything too seriously.  Anything Plum is going to be fun - with some books better than others.      If you like heroines, you will probably enjoy [[ASIN:1432745530 No Stone Unturned]], which follows the adventures of probation officer Linda Davenport in Orange County, California.  Linda solves a mystery and rekindles an old romance, in a real life format.  Sorry, no monkeys or pine barrens, but your interest will be held by the engrossing story line.    Back to PLUM SPOOKY, if you're an Evanovich fan, you know you'll be on a roller coaster, but you'll enjoy the ride.

6305907145|4.0|If you're looking for a movie with a Jane Austen-ish feel, you might like this movie.  However, I have to warn you that there are some things that I was surprised were in a PG movie.  I believe I saw a nudity for a brief moment.  I'm not sure about that because I didn't feel like rewinding it to make sure.  And there are also drawings of the brutal things that were happening to the slaves, including a woman being raped.  If you love the book and are looking for a good representation of it, I'm sorry to tell you that I don't think it exists.  I've seen 3 versions: this one starring Frances O'Connor, the version starring Billie Piper, and the awful 1986 adaptation.  In this version, lots of things are different from the book, most notably, the character of Fanny Price.  In the book she's quiet, but firm and virtuous.  I have to admit that this was never my favorite of Jane Austen's characters.  So while I actually liked the witty, active character that Frances O'Connor played in this version better than the true Fanny Price, it still bugs me that the movie strays so far from the book.  The version starring Billie Piper left out such large chunks from the book that events in that movie don't even make sense.  And the 1986 version stars the worst actress I've ever had the misfortune of seeing on the screen. In conclusion, if you're looking for a good and true representation of the book, don't buy this movie, and start petitioning BBC.
0385341008|3.0|When I first started reading this book, I thought I was going to love it.  I did enjoy the historical parts of this book. I did not enjoy the demeaning remarks about Christianity and Christians.<br /><br />Unfortunately 3/4 of the way in, I felt the book fell completlely flat.  Yet I continued.  There was a shift in the writing and to me, several things came out of left field. The romance came out of nowhere and seemed unbelievable. I thought it was strange that a complete stranger, Juliet, was trusted with the beloved orphan Kit in such a short time frame.  Also, the character Isola seemed to change into a strange lady.  JMO!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I love this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  For the most part, the acting is very good.  There are a few actresses whose performance were not good: Jane, Ms. Darcy, and Aunt Gardiner.  Some may argue that the part of Mrs. Bennett was overplayed, but in comic characters like that, I don't relly mind.  In this longer version, you get the full story.  You get to know the characters, and you get to see the relationship between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth bloom.
0312427646|5.0|I love to read, but it is unusual for me to find a book that I can best describe as being fun to read-not instructive, not thought provoking, not disturbing, not life changing or life affirming- (although this book in some ways does all that as well)-but fun to read.  The kind of book that makes me laugh out loud because the situation is so delightful and outlandish, and yet in a very quirky way, very believable.<br /><br />Oh! I forgot to tell you what book I'm talking about. . .  Well, it's the book I've been recommending to everyone I've seen in the past few days.  I tell them, \\"You've got to read this book. It will make you laugh, and you will identify with the love of reading it conveys on every page.  Put down everything else you're reading and read this book. Now\\"<br /><br />So, this book I'm raving about is The Uncommon Reader by Alan Bennett.  Alan Bennett is one of my favorite writers.  A few years ago I wrote about how much I loved his very odd little book The Clothes They Stood Up In.  And last year I told all my friends about the movie made of his Tony-award winning play The History Boys.  And, by the way, he also wrote The Madness of George III.<br /><br />Alan Bennett is funny in  the wry, iconoclastic, gentle/ferocious, literate, sly way that only the very best comic writers can be.  I react the same way to him that I do to James Thurber and love him most when he's making fun of what I normally think or do. In other words, Bennett (and Thurber and Twain and other writers of their ilk) can make me laugh heartily at the foibles of others, and even more uproariously at my own conceits and follies.<br /><br />Now Alan Bennett's latest book (a slender volume of 120 pages) is about the current Queen of England. . . yes, that Elizabeth, the one we've all come to like a lot more since Helen Mirren played her in the movie The Queen.  Bennett imagines that Queen Elizabeth one day stumbles upon a library bookmobile on her grounds at Windsor Castle, and strictly through politeness decides to take out a book.  Returning the book a few days later, she decides to take out another book, and before she knows what has happened she finds herself hooked.  Hooked on books. Hooked to the extent that she begins to resent and neglect her many royal duties because they cut into her precious reading time. Hooked, and what's more, for the first time in her royal lifetime, she begins to understand, a little, how the other 99.99 percent of the world lives.<br /><br />If, in fact, the greatest books are all inherently subversive, as some have said, then reading those books would be an act of subversion as well.  At least, the Queen's many courtiers and advisors come to think so, with even her Prime Minister feeling a great unease at having her quiz him about the books he is reading.  But will all the Queen's advisors be able to pry her away from her new- found love, no, her obsession with books? And if the Queen cannot get enough of the printed word, what will it mean for England?<br /><br />For the answer to these questions, you have got to read this book.  Now.  By the way, I think it would make a perfect present for your friends and family who love to read.  But first, read it-and laugh-yourself.take out a book.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|For a normal feature length film, I think this adaptation stays very true to the story.  There were a few things that I was sad to see change, like the personality of Mr. Wickham, and the more comic aspect of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett.  I do prefer the BBC adaptation a bit because you get the full story and you get more time to get to know Mr. Darcy and see the relationship develop.  But that version is much longer, and has a few less-than-outstanding actors.  If you're looking for a more concise bersion, this is wonderful.  The acting is superb and the original music is gorgous!  It you're a pianist, I highly recoomend the songbook also.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Filmmaking for incredibly short attention spans. Director Michael Bay's Veg-O-Matic style guarantees that no shot lasts longer than 10 seconds. This editing technique may work on a three-minute music video, but it's excruciating for a theatrical feature.

0525421033|4.0|Seventeen-year-old Mia is out for a car ride with her parents and little brother Teddy when the horrific happens: on a slick, snowy street, they're struck by a truck. Her mother and father are killed instantly, Mia comes to realize . . . as she stands outside the vehicle, looking at her own crushed body and those of her loved ones. Everything happens as if in a dream; Mia watches it all unfold, powerless and voiceless.<br /><br />After she's transported to a hospital and her grandparents arrive, desperately trying to talk to her as she remains in a coma, our narrator realizes she has a choice: stay in this terrifying new world without her parents, but with her loving boyfriend Adam and extended friends and family, or leave -- rejoining her family in whatever exists in the hereafter.<br /><br />Forman's small, sharp novel IF I STAY delves deep into what it means to be a family, including those attributes that both divide and unite us. Told over the course of just one day, the story flashes back to Mia's life in Oregon and shows us clearly the type of brilliant, focused and loving people her parents were. I loved learning about her dad's rock star past and could definitely feel the fierce protective quality her mom had for those whom she cared about most. What I loved most, though, was the story of Mia and Adam's love -- the sweetness that was the beginning of their romance, and the understanding and compassion they had for one another as it deepened. Joined through their love of music, Mia worries before the accident that Adam's band's rocketing success will eventually drive them apart -- especially considering Mia's devotion to the cello. Forman does a remarkable job of capturing the innocence and obsession of first love.<br /><br />As you'd expect, themes of death and grief are certainly prevalent -- and a few graphic passages didn't sit well with me. I was definitely rooting for Mia and hoping she'd make the right call, but I don't know what in the world I would do in her situation -- and pray I never have to even go there. I guess that's why the novel left me with a crater-wide pit in my stomach.. the realism of the story was scary. Because this trauma? It could happen to anyone.<br /><br />Recommended for older teens and adults of all ages. A tender, sad but ultimately uplifting story of loss, love and the strength we find in the most impossible of all circumstances.d pray I never have to even go there.

B002NXSRW0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It brought a favorite cartoon from childhood to the bigscreen and did a great job.  It also shared a trait with the original cartoon that is lost in most of today's entertainment... a plot!  So, now you know, and knowing is half the battle.
B0024FADAQ|4.0|If you were a kid in the 1980's then you saw \\"The Last Starfighter\\", simple as that. Either you caught it on the big screen, or saw it replayed one of a million times on HBO or Super TV (bonus points for anyone that remembers Super TV!). Not only does it feature the guy that kills himself in \\"Halloween 2\\" by slipping in blood (Lance Guest), it features \\"Night of Comet\\" heroine Catherine Mary Stewart. \\"Starfighter\\" gave every arcade game playing pre-teen geek the hope that for every quarter pumped into \\"Zaxxon\\", a little signal made it's way into deep space letting a distant alien race know of your awesome gaming skills. And if you plugged enough quarters into the game, and played well enough...then who knows...maybe you too could fight off the \\"Wizard of Wor\\".<br /><br />This is actually a fun little story about a kid stuck in a desert trailer park, acting as handyman for several octogenarian neighbors. He wants more, but looks like he'll be playing janitor for quite awhile longer as his request for a college loan gets turned down. He takes out his frustration on an army of intergalactic warriors via a videogame breaking the high score and \\"beating\\" the game. Turns out, there is more to beating the game than simply entering your initials in the hall of fame, and soon the teen finds himself whisked away to do battle among the stars for real.<br /><br />Sure, it's corny. The special effect while fantastic for the time, do seem a bit dated (but not as badly as expected, and much better than quite a few modern productions), but this film is a lot of fun. If you haven't seen this film since it's last run on HBO when Reagan left office...then give it another shot. It will provide you with some great memories, and it's a flick even the kids of today will enjoy. Video Games, laser cannons, space ships, aliens...what's not to like?
B001HN697M|4.0|I was a huge fan of the first and second Underworld movies, and enjoyed this one as well.  The story was very good, and filled in a lot of details mentioned in the first two movies.  I hope that another film can be made to follow the story of the second film, with Kate Beckinsdale back as the lead.

This is one of the most complete and truly amazing recordings I have heard in the past 10-20 years.  Truly a masterpiece!  Every song is good/great and the flow is so strong.  They blend hard rock/metal and beautiful harmony into an amazing musical gift for us all.  Do yourself a favor and get it.
0385504225|5.0|This book is just great, keep you always interested. It is also, as the others Dan Brown's books, deeply philosophical and educational, so may be is not the best novel, or the best educational book or the best philosphical book, but it has a great balance of all this subjects and for me, it is a 5 stars book. Hihly recommended.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had a lot more action than the the original series films and the Next Generation Films. It is action packed very different b/c it is an alternate Star Trek Universe and if JJ does a sequel I hope he dose as well as this one. I just enjoyed the film better than the other 10 that I have seen.
B0001WANCM|5.0|This is a movie that you could watch over and over again. I love the plot behind it, and the kids even enjoy watching it. Baseball has always been a favorite with my son, ever since he was 2 (he's now 10). I would recommend this movie to friends and family.

B002X20W2E|1.0|Wow! I liked her last CD just fine, but this is out of control. She has mentions of guns in almost every cut, violence in most of them. Yes, she is angry as heck, but is this the type of example you set for other victims of abuse? At the AMA's, she's decked out in guns, and the look on her face is like she wants to hurt someone. I'm worried for her, and for anyone going through domestic violence that listens to this CD. I hope she truly finds herself and gains enough self-worth to not let anyone step on her or control her, but without all this violence incorporated into it.

B001E95ZHY|4.0|This is a great movie.  Fans of the Office will love Rainn.  He does a great job as a middle aged guy who isn't quite ready to work a real job and still has some unfinished business when it comes to playing music -- something I'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to.  I think it does a good job of showing the excitment of putting a band together, when you think anything is possible, even though the fantasy is almost always better than the reality.  Funny cameo by Pete Best.    Music is actually pretty good.  If the metal songs had been released 20 years ago, they would have been hits.  Fun to look back on that stuff now that we don't take it so seriously.

B00008IAMD|5.0|Ha!  I was just listening to this album three days ago and bought it over three years ago.  That should be a sign of how awesome it is.  The american album series of covers, I think, was a great way for Johnny Cash to end his career with.  You can hear a song once, then hear it done again by Johnny Cash and it immediately becomes that much better.  Must own.
B0019X3ZZY|3.0|I saw this film a few weeks ago, and had heard about it for the last 20 years or so. At the time of its making, and even now, it certainly would have been considered pornographic, disturbing, etc. However, beyond the explicit content, the film is generally poorly made. This is something it shares with the film Caligula, which did have a big budget, and some good performances that didn't mask the lame excuse to make fetish and bad porn accessible, as pseudo-art for middle America. I wouldn't recommend either, unless you were hopelessly naive about politics, fascism, and atrocity, ... hmmm. That probably covers a lot of film-goers after all.

B000002MP3|5.0|This 1994 release from the original pop-punkers Green Day still sounds as great today as it did then,although a bit nostaglic (in a good way, of course).  It harkens back to the days of cutting class and smoking pot with a mohawk and torn-up cargo pants. Songs like \\"Burn-out\\" and \\"Welcome to Paradise\\" were the theme songs of Gen X. The top-ten hit \\"When I come around\\" was definitely a break-thru song for them and it's one of my personal favorites, along with \\"Basketcase\\" and \\"She\\".  The whole album is just like taking a teenager growing up in the 90's, sticking it in a garage, and giving it a mic and electric guitar. :)  Recommended to all!

B002N4DZ2G|3.0|Ugh... This appears to be a repackaging of the horribly remastered three-disc \\"Great Recordings of the Century\\" from 2002, with the addition of a so-called \\"bonus disc,\\" which simply replaces the printed libretto. I guess the \\"bonus\\" is that you get to print it out yourself on your home printer. But, the real fiasco is the re-use of the 2002 remastering, which is quite simply, horrible. It has no almost no high frequency response, sounds dull and muffled, more like a digitally synthesized message from your voicemail box than the sound of a splendid opera. It seems as though the only purpose of the 2002 remaster was to remove the tape hiss from the master tape, which was made in the golden era of stereo in the late 1950s, even though the hiss was hardly objectionable in the first instance, as evidenced by the excellent sound of the previous 1987 compact disc release. If you want to hear the difference, go to the MP3 download of the 1987 version, which still uses the 1987 mastering. You might also consider buying the highlights disc on CD, which still uses the 1987 mastering, and which, unlike the full opera, is still in print.
1401323820|5.0|As someone who has watched the series Castle since its first season I found it very easy to find this book entertaining and can easily see the shows influence in the characters and writing that brings their dialoge to life. When I bought the book and then come monday night when Castle was on there was made mention of several things that were actually in the book including a sex scene that was on the very same page as the show mentioned. Although fans of the show will find this a good read so will anyone looking for something to pass the time. It made me laugh when intended as well as suspensful when needed. At just under 200 pages this is a fast paced mystery that keeps you guessing until the end.

My son asked me last week if I had any more. When I looked I found I had no more so I went to your web site to see if you carried them; and low and behold here they are more than 30 years later. I am so thankful for this as my children had so much fun with thses books and apparently so is my 4 year old grandson.
0446679089|5.0|Nelson DeMille weaves a clever, page turning tale here with the adventures of John Corey. The characters are engrossing and believable, the protagonist all too human but also tough, smart and funny. The story totally sucks you in and keeps you reading until the very end. I've read this book twice and it had me laughing and anxiously anticipating what would happen next both times. Thank you Mr. DeMille for a fantastic tale of murder and treasure hunting.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|Directed by Luc Besson, Angel-A was first released in 2005. It's a French romcom (not quite what most would expect from Besson) and stars Jamel Debbouze and Rie Rasmussen in the two lead roles.    André is 28 years old and badly down on his luck. Although his working practices have been a little shady in the past, he's trying to make an honest fist of things and - following a recent trip abroad - is sure that his big break is just around the corner. However, given that he owes an absolute fortune to nearly every crook, villain and gangster in Paris, he mightn't live to see the good times. Having sought help and protection from both the police - who wouldn't lock him up for a few days - and the US Embassy - although of North African descent, he holds a green card - he's left alone and desperate. Eventually, he gives up and decides to throw himself off a bridge and into the Seine...and, just as he's about to jump, he notices Angela to his left. In fairness, Angela is very distracting : she's a tall, very leggy and exceptionally beautiful blonde...and the dress she's wearing only just keeps everything covered. Although he pleads with her not to jump, she won't listen...and so, rather than ending his own life, André finds himself jumping in and saving Angela's. The pair get talking on the banks of the river and, by way of thanks, Angela dedicates herself to helping André. Miraculously, with Angela on his side, things start looking up very, very quickly...    It is subtitled (which may put some people off) and it mightn't appeal to the very innocent, but I loved it. There is a real `feel-good' element to the movie and there is a pretty obvious comparison to \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". Some of the better known locations of Paris are used as the story's backdrop - the Seine and its bridges, the bateaux mouche and the Eiffel Tower - and it's very stylishly shot in black and white. A film I'd have no hesitation in recommending.

B002HWRYJE|2.0|Are their no real Star Trek fans writing reviews here? I have been a fan of all the series; from the original with William Shatner to the last network series Enterprise. Admittedly Enterprise was not the best of the lot, and some of the movies were grade B, however they all had a timeline, a standard story line, and an on-going cohesion.     This version of Star Trek says none of the earlier Television series ever happened and probably none of your beloved characters ever came to exist.     In this movie, is it not odd that James Kirk went from cadet, on the verge of being discredited and kicked out of Starfleet, then the next day is made 1st officer of the Enterprise, then another two days later is it's Captain!      Odd that only cadet's seem to man the crews of all the Federation ships?  Odd that if there are other more seasoned crew members, their pushed aside so the cadets who haven't even graduated yet take all leading posts on Enterprise, and from it's logic, the fleet?     Also, would you really want to follow this James Kirk, accept him as Captain?  He shows little personality traits of a leader you would want to follow. This is not the James Kirk we have all known and loved thru the years. The old Kirk was adventurous but he was seasoned with years of experience and reliabilty. Would you really put command of a ship on this guys shoulders?     In listening to the director, he's not a fan of Star Trek. He's a fan of Star Wars. He comments that Star Trek is slow, that modern audiences need faced paced action that is not achievable in the old franchise. So this I assume gives him justification to change the forty-year history of a franchise?      Destroying Vulcan, what does this do to the Federation's future, all the story lines that encompassed its people, its pivotal role in all the series and movies?     As I said, I'm a fan of the franchise. Now, as a fan, do I keep watching Deep Space Nine, Voyager, all the series again knowing in our fantasy world we've developed over the years, that all of these characters and events now never occurred? They never happened and will never happen?     The director is good at his craft; he shows us this by his self-indulging special features focused on him, I just wish he had been more of a fan of Star Trek.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|Usually Amazon's reviews are helpful but not so much in this case -- a lot of people gushing about the film and not so much about the product.  The film deserves the praise, sure, but I wanted to know whether this Blu-Ray release would contain all the special features from the DVD version of Casino Royale: Collector's Edition, which came in a 3-disc DVD set packed with features and had very nice packaging and a full-color, glossy booklet.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray release includes every single special feature from the DVD version of Casino Royale: Collector's Edition, and includes some Blu-Ray exclusive special features including BD-Live and a trivia quiz, which to be honest isn't that big a deal.<br /><br />As for appearance, the packaging is not the same and the glossy booklet is not included.  The DVD version of the Collector's Edition is much nicer in presentation, but I'm only buying this so I can see this film and features in 1080p.  However, I'll be keeping the DVD version of this because I really do love how that version was packaged.  I hope this helps you.
B002BFIN6K|3.0|The work Zenph does with old recordings is amazing, and this disc is no exception.  But the decision of the record company to issue it as a CD rather than an SACD makes it poor value.    Previoius Zenph releases have been on hybrid SACD, which allows the listener to have a full program of music and still enjoy the binaural mix using headphones.  By releasing this as a single-layer CD, the program is duplicated: once for the stereo, once for the binaural, on a single layer which contains roughly 79 minutes of data.  That means only approximately 39 1/2 minutes of material.  In this day and age, that is inexcusable.  The playing is excellent, but there is simply not enough of it.
0312427565|5.0|I picked up The Right Stuff, expecting to read a detailed history of the US space program; from the breaking of the sound barrier to the Moon landing.  Instead Wolfe has written a book about the rare breed of men that have the necessary ice water coursing through their veins to fly the experimental fighter jets, and to sit on the tips of rockets.  This isn't a book about the science and bureaucracy of aviation in the 50s and 60's, but instead a study of the psyche of the pilot.<br /><br />This is a fast past paced narrative which portrays the pilot of the cold war as a near mythical figure - an American David to the Soviet Goliath.  In doing so Wolfe also examines the psyche of the American people during this time, and provides an interesting commentary on society.  It harkens back to a time when America could accomplish what was thought unthinkable, by the sheer determination and true patriotism of its people.  In a way that is almost hard for us today to imagine, these pilots not for monetary gain, risked their lives for their country and for the prestige of being called a true brother among pilots.  Society today has a strange way of making celebrities out of the nobodies and the untalented.  Reading The Right Stuff in 2009, is a reminder that America once extolled the virtue of real accomplishment, of being chosen from the select few, and from the select few proving to have the right stuff.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Great Movie. I have it in vhs and have always wanted it in Blu-Ray. It will look awesome.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I purchased three  CD's.  I will be purchasing 15 more for gifts.  Susan's voice is a gift from God to all of us.  Each word is pronounced with feeling.  It seems to me that the words to these songs were mean't to be heard in our world today. Susan has been chosen to deliver them NOW in a way many will listen.  It goes without saying that she sings like an angel.  More than that, she is speaking to the world. For the first time in her life, what she has to say is being taken to heart.  Susan Boyle has struggled with the judgment of others since childhood.  Now SHE is letting the world know what she felt in her heart through the years.  She is \\"beautiful\\" in every way.  She is very real...she experiences anxiety when she is overwhelmed with ANY emotion, she is a gentle spirit, she is spunky and humble.  The CD is great, I can only hope she will continue to record more albums.  Sacred Music would put her off the charts again.  Show tunes, well chosn will be a sell out too.  A Christmas Album?  Who wouldn't buy it?  PS.  This is the first music album I have ever purchased.  I am 71 years old. I recommend this CD for everyone.
1400064287|5.0|I found this book very valuable so I gave it as a gift to a close friend, I missed having it, so I bought another copy.  A must have in any intelectual's library.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've read almost all of Stephen Ambrose's books, and this set is so well done !!  Had to have it in my collection.  Especially love the interviews with the real cast, and hearing their stories...
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I do not like grouchy old man. I do not like movie that toys with emotion. I do not like dogs. So I did not like the whole settings for this animation from the start. It took me a long time to even bother to watch this. And the first time, I watched here and there because of my 33 months old. He adores this movie. There are a lot of emotional ups and downs and my boy acts it out. He calls Russell baby and loves to follow what he says and how he acts. It is not an animation of 3 year old. But there is nothing that's out of ordinary that should be objected to. All are part of every day life that young and old has to confront. So far, Pixar has managed well mixing materials for young and old together well enough to be enjoyed by all groups. The Incredibles being the prime example. Story of middle aged man going through their mid-life crisis wrapped around comic characters that a whole family can enjoy. That's the mastery of Pixar's series. Younger ones that don't understand should be just ignoring the depths of the issues naturally and depth of the story is only unlocked as they \\"understand\\" the underlying story. That's mastery!    On the second viewing, all the details of the movie grab my attention and as usual all over the movie there were subtle mastery of story telling. The old man was genuine character, not something that someone just came up with. He was someone that most of us could associate with. Russell is also one of our boy and who I once was. With all the badges earned still unsure of oneself. Through all the bravery, weak and naive and so very much a child.     I see poor reviews of Pixar movies and they center around Pixar not being purely children's animation. I have a very strong objection to that type of idea. 1. I watch all Pixar movies with my boy ever since he was able to watch them. He chooses what he wants to watch. Toy Story 2, Cars, Up. I talk with him, tell him stuff. We don't quite communicate yet but he listens and \\"appreciates\\" the interaction. 2. Things like infertility, death and family issues, younger ones just don't understand and they will just skip those scenes naturally. It will be wrong to assume that 2-3 year old struggling with life and death and infertility questions. It's more likely the adults watching it has those questions they themselves haven't worked out with themselves. Deal with it. Pixar present them in best possible way.     UP is another gift by Pixar to humanity. Thank you, Mr. Jobs and Mr. Lasseter. This is a 175 million dollar gift from them to you. Enjoy it for $20!
0307269752|1.0|Today I reached the end of Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  I've spent a great percentage of the hours since I closed the paperback edition that final time contemplating why I didn't like it.  Surely it was well written and well plotted but misogyny turns my stomach and this was naked misogyny that was truly horrific in scale. I would have actually closed the yellow cover once and for all at a very early juncture but for the fact that I was reading it on the recommendation of a friend and therefore felt obligated to charge on.  Perhaps I'm being overly sensitive; I'm not immune to that, especially when my \\"button\\" is pressed.  Misogyny is a hot button of mine.  Still, remove from the narrative the misogynistic current (an impossibility, but for arguments sake, remove it) and this author still set my sensibilities aflame.  I'm an avid reader and a pretty open-minded one at that - rarely have I a reaction so visceral.  This is my opinion of course, and I believe it is the minor one, but anyone who has the first volume of what is a loosely connected trilogy on their \\"to read\\" list -  I recommend steering clear of this one.
006112429X|1.0|I have never in my life given up on a book on the first page before.  But, halfway through the first page of this book, I was already thinking it was mired in self-indulgence.  Then I came upon this sentence and a pure truth revealed itself to me.  There was absolutely no good reason why I should have to spend one more page with that women.  I put the book down, got up and walked away.  This was the sentence that did it for me:    \\"What a more considerable achievement, to root around in the untransubstantiated rubbish of plain old New York state and scrounge a moment of piquancy from a trip to the Nyack Grand Union.\\"      Maybe, just maybe, if she were weaving some tortured, Catholic metaphor through the narrative, I would have give her a few more pages.  Why would you possibly choose the word \\"untransubstantiated\\" in lieu of something short, clear and concise like \\"boring\\".  Who writes that way?  Who publishes writing like that?  I knew at that moment that I was about to read a book that really only dealt with the author's aggressive insecurity about her intelligence, and maybe had a few bits about a violent child thrown in to make it palatable.
B001FB55I0|1.0|This film was atrociously bad.  I wouldn't watch it again if it was running free on network TV, much less buy a copy of it.  It was pathetic in all aspects...
0307269981|5.0|Larsson's second book in his masterful trilogy is even better than his first.  Rarely do sequals surpass the original stories. This one does so.<br />With the same unique set of characters and a more complex plot, Larsson explores the underbelly of Swedish society, giving the reader an insight into a world that he must surely have gained the hard way as an experienced liberal journalist in real life. It's a great pity that we have only the final book left to read due to the author's death from a heart attack at age 50.<br /><br />Only three novels from Larsson, whilst Grahame Greene, who shared with the reader similar deep probings into the dark side of human nature, gave us more than thirty.<br /><br />Dr. John Bank
B001M5UDGS|2.0|The DVD sometimes runs on my player and some time it doesn't, and can't seems to get the special feature, like commentary and making, to play.    Also, it skips as well
B0026P3G12|1.0|... I do not love this album.  \\"I dreamed a dream\\" still gives me chills on YouTube, and this version is fine also.  But the rest of the album - painfully slow arrangements, and somewhat breathy enhanced production -- tracks which do not take advantage of Susan's powerful voice.  One example - \\"How Great Thou Art\\" - would be a perfect hymn to showcase Susan's soaring vocals - but not in this version.  And the selection of songs is also very weird - I think someone could have given her a bit more guidance in the creation of the songlist for this first album.      On her next album, I would listen to the tracks first and then decide whether to buy the album or just some songs.  For this one, I would only have bought two - I Dreamed a Dream and Cry Me a River.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|everyone should watch this movie,i am not one bit a trekkie and i loved it
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This edition of Good Evening New York City has two awesome CDs and a two hour plus DVD with excellent footage, all compiled from the three nights Paul and his band played at New York City's Citi Field Stadium in July, 2009. Paul and his mates (Paul \\"Wix\\" Wickens, Rusty Anderson, Abe Laboriel, Jr. and Brain Ray) are in excellent form; and the guest appearance by Billy Joel is absolutely wonderful! The CDs have some background noise from the crowd which shows just how much Paul McCartney and his band enjoyed a very positive, even electric rapport with their audience. In addition, the DVD has crystal clear footage of the songs they performed over the three nights although there was a bit too much footage of the audience which should have been replaced with footage of the performers on stage. However, don't let this dissuade you from getting this package: it's still extremely good and a must-have for any Paul McCartney fan. In addition, fans of The Beatles may want this also because McCartney makes sure to include lots of Beatles tunes in his show.<br /><br />There are so many jewels here that it's impossible to highlight just a few of them; Paul and his buddies do outstandingly well. There's Beatles standards including \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" \\"Drive My Car;\\" \\"Back in the USSR;\\" \\"Something (written by George Harrison);\\" \\"Let It Be;\\" \\"Hey Jude;\\" \\"Lady Madonna;\\" \\"I Saw Her Standing There;\\" \\"Yesterday\\" and the ending medley of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band/The End.\\"<br /><br />It's just as important to mention some of the terrific songs Paul gave us after the breakup of The Beatles. \\"Jet;\\" \\"Flaming Pie;\\" \\"Let Me Roll It;\\" \\"Highway;\\" Calico Skies;\\" \\"Only Mama Knows\\" and \\"Sing The Changes\\" are performed with lots of positive energy and panache.<br /><br />The DVD gives you the feeling of being there for an entire night's concert although I have the impression that this was a film created by patching together footage from all three nights Paul and his buddies played at Citi Field Stadium. The quality of the print is flawless; it's quite clear and the sound leaves nothing to be desired. Play this on a big screen TV with all the lights down and you'll swear you were right there! There could have been a little less footage of the audience and a little more footage of Paul and the band but still this is quite a fine DVD.<br /><br />Good Evening New York City is a fantastic 2 CD, 1 DVD set and any Paul McCartney fan will want this for their collections. This set also makes a terrific introduction to Paul and his artistry for people just discovering his magic. It's something to seriously consider for Beatles fans, too.ality of the print is flawless; it's quite clear and the sound leaves nothing to be desired.

B00180R06I|2.0|Vampyr is a film designed to baffle the viewer - and it succeeds brilliantly. With no coherent story line or identification of the characters, and with its disconnected jumps from one scene to another, this viewer was left completely at sea.<br />The Criterion release adds a screenplay book and a smaller booklet about the film and its history. The special features on Disc 2 are also interesting but neither these nor the commentary provides much clarity about what is going on.<br />Criterion did what it could to render the poor-quality film elements viewable, but picture quality is only fair. Sound, conversely, is quite good.<br />This is not in the same league as other Criterion titles such as The Third Man and M.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I pre-ordered this cd to support an inspirational lady with a great story to tell.  I honestly wanted to do my part to help her get off on the right foot....and now....I've received my cd and it turns out that the blessing was mine.  I won't even try to put words to it besides just saying its absolutely awesome...  The ultimate turn out the lights, light a few candles and escape from the world cd. Susan you're right where you're suppose to be. At the top and deep into so many of our hearts.  I love your music and what it does to my soul. I dare somebody to listen to it and not tear up...Awesome!!!!!!
B001GCUNWQ|2.0|Don't show your kids this if you're expecting the same quality as the first two movies. Instead of a well-done plot now there are 1.5 hours full of trashy lines, sight gags and overdone stereotypes.  You would think it was done by a whole different crew. No life lessons here, just constant slapstick with sexual overtones. My seven year old enjoyed it because she didn't get the lewd stuff, but it got old for me pretty quickly. Just my opinion. This is the end of the run for me, and it's a shame, but I guess when you run out of creativity and need to bring in revenue this is what happens. Stuff like \\"Oh, it's a boy!\\" \\"No, that's just it's tail\\". You decide.

0385504225|1.0|Throughout most of the novel \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" Robert Langdon questions what he is doing there. The reader can sympathasize. \\"The Lost Symbol\\" brings us back to Robert Langdon, the Harvard professor and symbologist in Washington DC searching for the Lost Word. Ironically, it reads like the previous Dan Brown books. All in one day, a random series of connected events, a crazied madman thinking he can solve the worlds evils with his actions, the hard ass government authority figure seeming to be against Langdon, the new security guard that does as he is told, the rich family that needs Roberts help, and the smart girl who finds solace in Robert and helps him along the way. It's the same book Dan Brown has recycled to a new city. It's a tired storyline and a disappointing addition to the Robert Langdon series, who quite frankly was just a bore in this novel. As Robert ponders how he got into this mess, we wonder the same thing. How did we get ourselves into this mess of a book? Save your money!
B00005QGAT|5.0|Outstanding work by Micheal and Quincy. Forever set Micheal apart from his talanted brothers and establish him as not only the most polished of the Jackson family at the time, but as a force to be wreckoned with.

For Christians and non-believers it is a terrific introduction and guide to those interested only in, say, biblical history or theology or those also wanting a greater understanding of their faith through study of the bible.

I am more than pleased with this purchase.

It gives a differenct appreciation of what a \\"miracle\\" looks like.    Israel in a new light
B000LYCNJQ|5.0|This movie, in my mind, is really just an introduction to the series. Minimal action compared to the others. The acting in the original Star Wars trilogy is better than in the new movies. When I say this I am primarily referencing Harrison Ford in his debut as a major film actor. There is only one lightsaber duel, which last all of about 1 minute. The best part is at the end when Luke Skywalker, the \\"hero\\" blows up the Death Star. And by the way, I wouldn't recommend watching the Star Wars films in order of release because you won't grasp the continuity of the films that way. Watch them in order of episode number. You will gain a much better feel for how all the movies fall together in the larger scheme. A little trivia: there are rumors circulating that there will be more Star Wars films released. I hope they do, because, after it's all said and done, the only thing you don't understand is what goes on in the twenty or so years between Episodes III and IV. So one would think if there were new movies, they would explain some of that. Overall, this is a great film. You won't regret buying it.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I have received Susan Boyle's first CD and have listened to it several times.  I feel that she and her powerful voice have been dealt a tremendous injustice by the overwhelming background accompaniment volume on this CD...something that I find very offensive.  The point is for the accompaniment to be be subtle in the background so Susan's voice can shine in the forefront, isn't it?!  I hope Susan, you will branch out into more classical music...you have the voice, the projection, and I know you can do it!  Perhaps Wagner or J.S. Bach???  You CAN do it!!!

B001NXDSLQ|4.0|This is a great DVD, I own alot of Music Documentaires on DVD and this one is a great one to have.  But just know that this is just the concert and there are no speical features in this at all. It might say there are but there are no interviews or anything. You think there would be more. But other than that it is a great concert. Wish I could of been there and it feels like you are in this DVD.
0143038419|1.0|I am surprised to see that so many people shared my antipathy for this book.  I really wanted to like it.  I wanted to join a conversation with people who thought it was great.  But it was like making friends with a girl who is on everyone's \\"popular\\" list, but her conversation always gets back to her -- her dreams, her goals, her pain, her boyfriend, her ex-husband, where she bought her shoes, her favorite pasta, her oh-so-silly embarrassing moments, her sex life, her thoughts, her, HER, H E R.  But I guess if you pick up a memoir you should be prepared for a trip down the black hole of someone's ego.    The thing I found really objectionable is that she makes a rather arch pronouncement that she will not be discussing the divorce in the book, and then mentions it all the way through, along with her acute pain, which I believe is really real.  I'm sure it is painful to realize that you are lying to your spouse about having kids, and that isn't okay with him.  He should just agree and go off quietly, dammit!  She says very clearly that she moved from her marital home right to the House of David.  That was quick -- so it wasn't all about not wanting to have kids, was it, Liz?  But who am I to judge.    But, you know, I thought the parts where she discusses religions and beliefs were well-done.  It's just...it's a shame.  She's a smart lady, but wow, I'll never get those hours back I spent in the vortex of her self-absorption.

Also it was to graphic in the oral sex department. Come on! Your not a good writer if you have to bring up crap like that. It doesn't make it less real if you leave that stuff out. Stephenie Meyer did it along with Kristin Cashore and Suzanne Collins. (and many more) I will not be reading any of the other books and I will not be recommending this to anyone.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I still listen to Alice in Chains even after all these years, when I heard they had a new album out I was very skeptical, I'm so glad I gave it a listen, this is a great album, I listened to it back to back and enjoyed every song. The band still has the same style, the music is still the same , and the new vocalist sounds so much like Layne Staley, If I didn't know I would have thought this albums was released 15 years ago.
B00000DF6O|4.0|Excelente disco, realmente estaba buscando algo de blues puro, tal cual lo interpreta el gran B.B. King. Sin embargo, creo que el disco está un poco estancado en el estilo. Creo que pudo haber sido genial introducir algunas canciones que rompieran con el ritmo en general. Ampliamente recomendable!!!
B002NXSRX4|1.0|This movie is 'Spy Kids'. The people who liked this movie must just happy that some form of GI Joe was on the big screen. This seriously couldn't have been worse if they were fighting Barney.

B0000399WI|5.0|Even after all these years I still find my self watching this movie from time to time, I am a big fan of documentaries about criminal investigation, court trials and prisons, and this in my opinion seems to be the best fictional movie about prison and incarceration ever made.
0785814531|3.0|I am the Poe novice. I've heard much about him, and finally decided to get a copy of his complete works. Before I begin, I am a fan of, and quite capable of digesting 19th century literature. Furthermore, those buying this book for a Poe fan, or for themselves (already being a fan) will find a great deal for the money. A sound bargain.    However, for the Poe novice, one who is merely curious about this author of great renown, I offer this review of the writer himself.    A curious thing that an author of mostly short stories should be so tedious and long-winded. Imagine that - a tedious and long-winded SHORT story. Never before has half a dozen pages seemed like hundreds.    The stories themselves are often silly affairs, where after dragging out a wordy introduction, the author hastily advances the disingenuous plot, and resolves the conflict with naive or farcical devices.    With very few exceptions (The Fall of The House of Usher, The Raven) most of the stories have not aged well regarding their ability to chill, mystify, or beguile. Considering E.A. Poe's milieu, it is not hard to see why he was overlooked in his lifetime. It is only a wonder that he has posthumously received such a lofty reputation for anything other than The Raven - his only true \\"masterpiece.\\"     To be fair, there were a few stories I found engaging enough for their style (The Black Cat, The Facts in The Case of M. Valdemar, The Murders In The Rue Morgue, The Cask of Amontillado) but they were still lacking in sufficient substance. What may have awed or stumped people centuries go now seems rather obvious - like a ghost story that can only scare children because they have not yet developed higher reasoning faculties. The stories may begin with a shroud of the macabre, but wind up finishing with less impact than desired.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I am using this in an HP notebook with Microsoft Streets and Trips software. A really nice combination.<br /><br />When I installed the software (which I got from their website, since I am using Windows 7, I wanted the latest drivers), and plugged in the device, it was recognized right away and assigned a comport, 4 being the favored one apparently. I then tried the little location program they give you to test it to make sure it works before trying it with any other mapping software. Funny thing is, it couldn't find the device. I loaded up Streets & Trips and it detected it with no problem. Get 7 satellites here in the house and 9 to 10 out on the road.<br /><br />The wire is plenty long enough for most uses, and it is as magnetic as they say. I usually just put it on the dash and it stay there just fine.<br /><br />Can't go wrong with this one, inexpensive and does what it should.
B002JCSWHA|4.0|\\"Hachiko: A Dog's Tale\\" is directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules), and is based loosely on the real life story of a dog, named Hachiko, who was born in Odate, Japan in 1923. His master, Dr. Eisaburg Ueno, was a professor at the University of Tokyo who died in 1925. Hachiko returned to the Shibuya train station the next day, and every day for the next nine years until he died in 1934. Today, outside the Shibuya train station, where Hachiko waited, is a bronze statue of Hachiko.<br /><br />In this particular movie we have a similar story, only the dog is in transport to the United States, where he escapes, and ends up in Parker Wilson's (Richard Gere) possession. Parker eventually decides to keep the dog since the owner cannot be found. Hachiko, or Hachi, as he is usually called here, at one point breaks free of his yard, and follows Parker to the train station. Eventually Hachi is allowed to accompany Paker to the train station everyday. But at one point Parker never returns to the train station, since he has died at the university.<br /><br />The movie then becomes a tale of a loyalty that reaches far into the bonds of memory. Hachiko never realizes that his master has died, and even though he never sees his master again, he never forgets him. What is Hachi's purpose now that his master has died? His purpose seems to be to wait for his master who will never return. It is at once moving and heartrending, as it is a tragedy of sorts, and one that is only resolved once Hachiko also dies. This is a beautifully told tale that makes one think about the things that are important for us to go on living, even after those that we have loved have died.
B001PR0YDA|3.0|I brought my 3 kids and niece to see this 2 days after Thanksgiving. I thought that this would be a nice holiday movie to see to get us into the holiday spirit since we have yet to get any snow where we live.  My 3 year old spent much of the movie with his head in my shoulder after the first scare.  I tried to remember after the doorknob any other parts that they might make extra scary for him from other Christmas Carol movies.  My 8 year old told me that it was more for Halloween than Christmas, and my 11 year old and 13 year old niece both said that it was good but agreed with the 8 year old that we should of gone to see around Halloween.  It's a alright movie to see I guess once but I won't buy it or see it again I will stick with Mickey's Christmas Carol of the Muppets Christmas Carol, Scrooged any other version of a Christmas Carol is better than this one.  I did not have the Christmas spirit after seeing this version of A Christmas Carol it was a very dark version and not very cheery at all not even the end maybe if there was more of the holiday cheer at the end but that was very brief.
B001GCUO16|2.0|When the studios first came up with the idea of adding digital copies to dvd's and blu ray's, you used to get a 2nd disc of bonus features, and then the digital copy of the movie.  Not long after that, the studios decided to just cram all the bonus features and such onto 1 disc, and then make the 2nd disc the digital copy.  Ok, fine, but why do all the advirtisments and box's say '2 Disc Edition + Digital Copy'.  Am I wrong, or does that imply 2 disc's PLUS digital copy???  Batman's 'The Dark Knight' blu ray say's 2 disc on the box, and that is exactly what you get, IN ADDITION to a 3rd disc, which is the digital copy.    To top it off, there was a limited 3 disc blu ray version, that just had the theatrical cut on dvd as the 3rd disc.  Personally I could care less for the digital copy, they should just offer that for download from a site, which is what I think they tried to do at first, and is what record companies are doing for music.    Anyways, decent movie.  Yeah, we all hoped for more, and wished the first and especially the 3rd X-Men movie's were better.  Looks great and sounds even better on blu ray.  And what can I say, I'm looking forward to the next installment and much rumored Magneto origins.

B000MV90B2|5.0|Excellent depiction of the battle of waterloo . Good acting  with Rod Steiger(Napoleon) and Christopher Plummer(Wellington) and many others depicting the historical participants. The film gets into some of the politics of the time but is principally a historical epic  showing the battle with its cast of thousands. The battle sequences are excellent and historically accurate. Bonderchuk directed, as he did War and Peace with the battle of Borodino. Excellent film.
B001C4CI8A|4.0|During the so called \\"war on terror\\", DiCaprio plays the role of Ferris; a CIA agent who unravels the hidden parties and games of this war.<br /><br />Other than my personal satisfaction of seeing DiCaprio looking like a man, not just a pretty boy, the character of Ferris displays outstanding intelligence and genuine humanity. To listen to Ferris debating real Islam and verses of Quran with his torturers is priceless because it shows how people are rejecting the lies that terrorists attach to Islam.<br /><br />Pretty boys, Crow and DiCaprio, both showed great talents looking like regular men in a wonderful and thought provoking plot. Watch and think!  Does terror have a religion??
0670867950|5.0|This is the best illustrated classic book I found so far. Reading the original can be a great challenge for young readers. But this book makes it not only easier but fun: instead of reading long boring explanations what some words mean or things look like kids can look through the very thoughtfully chosen illustrations that boost imagination and give them a sense of epoch of pirates and adventures.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Black Gives Way To Blue is a CD that takes me back about 15 years or so to the height of grunge music.  While Alice in Chains is more complicated than a single label, there has been a musical void since the grunge movement ended in the 90's.  As I listen to this CD, I find it every bit as dark and brooding as the music that marked that period.<br /><br />It is also a bold move by the remaining members of the band after lead singer Layne Staley's passing in 2002, and it is their first studio recording with new vocalist William DuVall.  While the sound of Black Gives Way To Blue is true to Alice in Chains, I have to give DuVall credit for not falling into the trap of trying to sound like another Staley.  However he and Jerry Cantrell manage to blend their vocals in a way that longtime fans will find familiar yet fresh.  The differences start out subtle on the opener \\"All Secrets Known\\" and \\"Check My Brain\\", but DuVall takes center stage on \\"Last Of My Kind\\".  The good news is that DuVall is no slouch whatsoever, and he is a big part of making this CD great.  It may sound odd to say this about an Alice in Chains song, but the harmonies on the second verse of \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" are a thing of beauty.<br /><br />The instrumentation on Black Gives Way To Blue is very tight.  Most songs are driven by the three pronged attack of drums, bass, and rhythm guitar to a pace that is moderate.  Alice in Chains was never a thrash or punk band, and the slower tempos helped create the brooding vibe.  At the same time, though, there are a couple of acoustic heavy tracks in \\"Your Decision\\" and \\"When The Sun Rose Again\\".  The latter also features tablas, an Indian percussion instrument, that adds a unique vibe.  I found the structure of \\"Acid Bubble\\" to be very interesting as the verses are fairly slow and driven by the base line while the chorus takes the tempo up briefly before giving way to the second verse.  This pattern repeats after the second verse and then the song ends.  As a final note, the piano on \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" is courtesy of none other than Elton John.  That has to be pretty far up the list of unexpected collaborations!<br /><br />I'm not sure how much of the lyrical content is supposed to be about Staley's drug use and its affect on the band, but you can certainly read that into a number of the songs.  \\"All Secrets Known\\" seems to be about moving on from the past as it opens \\"Hope/A new beginning\\".  However \\"Your Decision\\" seems to be the most pointed with lines like \\"Time to change has come and gone/Watched your fears become your God\\" or later in the song \\"You feed the fire that burned us all/When you lied/To feel the pain that spurs you on/Black inside\\".  One could argue, though, that \\"When The Sun Rose Again\\" is just as strong with \\"Pray/Squeal when your caught/Cry/It's not my fault\\" and \\"Time to trade in never befores/Selling out for the score\\".  Yet on the closer, \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" to tone is more conciliatory \\"Lay down, black gives way to blue/Lay down, I'll remember you\\".  This brought things full circle for me as it hints at the night passing into a new day but with a touch of sentimentality.<br /><br />Overall, it is hard to call Black Gives Way To Blue anything short of a triumph.  I highly recommend it to fans of Alice in Chains' previous work or the 90's grunge music.  I've had a hard time keeping this out of the CD player in my car.<br /><br />Download this:  Your Decision, the piano on \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" is courtesy of none other than Elton John.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I've hesitated on reviewing this for several years now even though I've owned the dvd since its release. I guess I wanted to give it couple attempts to change my mind. Unfortunately, I still feel the same way about this adaptation. It's still the most deplorable adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I've seen even though I really wanted to like it. There are just too many things that were done incorrectly in this adaptation including casting, wardrobe, dialogue, etiquette, and so on. There were too many cringe-inducing scenes and dialogue to allow me the luxury of enjoying it.<br /><br />While I like Keira Knightley as an actress, her portrayal of Elizabeth was simply wrong. Her Elizabeth erred more on the side of petulant rather than witty. I won't even talk about some of the things that her Elizabeth said and did that Jane Austen's Elizabeth would never say and do because they would be considered improper. I also had a problem understanding Keira Knightley. She spoke her lines way too fast and I was often forced to use the subtitles to understand what she was saying. The rest of the cast I easily understood. I also like Matthew MacFayden. I've seen him in Little Dorrit and The Way We Live Now. However, his portrayal of Mr. Darcy was far too timid. There was nothing confident or supercilious about his attitude; he was therefore unconvincing. The only character portrayal that I liked was Rosamund Pike's Jane. The rest also missed the mark for me.<br /><br />Overall, I was really looking forward to this adaptation when I heard a new Pride and Prejudice was coming out. Unfortunately, this just didn't cut it.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Countless movies were made about the tragedies of World War II, but I have never seen a more perfect and touching movie. The story is about a Jewish woman who's trying to survive after losing everything she had.  It turns out that even when you are dead inside, you can still hurt.<br /> Carice van Houten is an incredibly talented actress as described by the director. I enjoyed watching her carry the burden of creating the action around her character whilst allowing the other characters to shine.  Sebastian Koch, Thom Hoffman, and Derek de Lint are all amazing telling stories of love, betrayal, loss, parenthood and heroism. It's been a while since I cried, and I did watching Carice finally fall apart in tears. Amazing performance and direction; don't miss it.
1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink has written a highly interesting and very informative book on the truth about what motivates us.<br /><br />He uses a very interesting analogy - comparing motivation to different generations of operating software.  Motivation 1.0 the basic operating system for the first few thousand years was based on the primary needs of the human - food, shelter, clothing and reproduction.  Eventually we moved to Motivation 2.0 - basically the carrot and the stick - reward and punishment worked fairly well for a time.<br /><br />But according to Pink and other scientists, reward and punishment no longer work in most situations.  We need to move to Motivation 3.0.<br /><br />Pink goes into great detain about why the carrot and stick motivation does not work.  \\"The traditional `If then' rewards can give us less of what we want.  They extinguish intrinsic motivation, diminish performance, crush creativity and crowd out good behavior.  The can encourage unethical behavior, create addictions and foster short-term thinking.  These are the bugs in our current operating system.\\"<br /><br />The \\"if then\\" reward/punishment system does work under very limited conditions.  Pink explores these.<br /><br />He then introduces the I Type and X Type behavior - named for intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.  Type I behavior concerns itself less with external rewards and more with doing things for the joy of doing them.<br /><br />There are three elements to the I Type behavior: Autonomy - we all long to be autonomous - to have control over our lives and destiny.  To the extent that we don't have autonomy we feel something missing.  The second element is Mastery.  We need to learn to master the tasks we are undertaking.  The third element is Purpose.  We need to \\"buy in\\" to why we are doing things.  There needs to be a reason.<br /><br />The final section of the book is a Toolkit section where there are strategies for individuals, companies, tips on compensation, suggestions for education and suggested reading.<br /><br />This is highly entertaining and thought provoking.  At some time we all face the challenge of trying to motivate others.  For the most part we have relied on the reward/punishment approach.  You will learn why this does not work and a better approach to motivation no matter who you are working with.<br /><br />The book is well written and there are many references to back up the claims made.  I highly recommend this book.ng and thought provoking.  At some time we all face the challenge of trying to motivate others.  For the most part we have relied on the reward/punishment approach.

B002NUULNG|5.0|It has both the new remastered and the original version of the film on one disk. What else do you need to know. The new 3-D stuff is cool but it stands out too much. On the other hand the new sound and remastered 2D animation is great. But if your old school and prefer the original version (like myself), you will be happy to know that the original is on here as well, untouched. It's in the extras. With that said, this is an amazing disk. If your a fan or Oshi or ghost in the shell and want to watch it in HD? Then this disk is for you.
0142410349|5.0|The three meanest farmers in the county are determined to kill Mr. Fox.  In their unrelenting war against our suave and roguish hero, they inflict terrible damage to the countryside and threaten the lives of many other animals that share the hills with Mr. Fox.  As the farmers create wanton destruction, the animals look after each other and find a just if morally questionable solution to the threat to their children's and their lives.<br /><br />Many folks are going to have a problem with this one.  \\"It's too scary\\", \\"It glorifies theft\\", \\"It's a tree-hugger political tract\\", et cetera.  What a load of tosh.  This is a kids' book, written by a man who understood what worries kids and what inspires kids.  Kids are worried by mean people who are bigger than them, like the three farmers.  Kids are worried by being pursued, the way the three farmers were after Mr. Fox.  Kids are inspired by a little guy who can outsmart the big, mean people, like Mr. Fox.  Kids are inspired people who look out for other people the way Mr. Fox did.  Kids are inspired by food, and food was a central theme to this book.<br /><br />It's got action, drama, heroism, and humor.  \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" is writing at its best.<br /><br />E. M. Van Court

She LOVES this book, she sits through the whole book, and wants it read over and over.  The only thing she does with \\"Another Monster\\" is occasionally look at the pictures to point out Elmo.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has been vendicated for the stupidity of the English public who voted for the 'Dance Group'? (who in a year will not even be remembered). This is REAL talent! She does not need gimmicks, sound effects, etc. to make her sound better. This is a pure voice, A REAL SINGER. By the end of the album I had chills and two of the songs, I Dreamed a Dream and Who I was Born To Be moved me to tears. If this is to be her only album (I hope to God it is not)it is steller. Susan has heart and soul in her voice. We have not had this in such a long time. BRAVO, Susan! We who saw your gift and believed in you are not disapointed. As some of the other reviews have stated, I do hope your producers will let you sing with the power you have and not try to subdue that wonderful strength you have. I also hope they will cut back on the choir in the background. They were loud, shrill and did nothing to compliment your great gift. Producers, let the woman sing the way she wants to sing and you will have a \\"GREAT\\" star on your hands. I would love to hear her sing songs like You 'll Never Walk Alone, As Time Goes By, The Man I Love, My Man, etc. These sons would show the world what a great voice this woman has. Belt it out, Susan! I am buying another CD so I can have one in my home and one in my car. Mozel Tov, Susan!
1932100660|5.0|My wife got about 80 pages into this book and decided to become a vegan. In her zeal, she has not progressed any further in the book. After being skeptical/critical of her quick conversion, I picked up the book and read it in two days.    The reason I suggest that this book is not like many other popular health books, is because the author isn't obviously hawking a program or product. From start to finish, his tone (collaborating with his son), is simply that of a principled scientist with knowledge he believes will help save countless lives and reduce suffering. Motives-wise, Dr. Campbell is much more Albert Schweitzer than Dr.s Adkins or Weil. If you decide to act on what you read here, the author doesn't gain anything. Which is why the one and two star reviews don't seem credible to me. The criticisms I read in comments here of the science in this book are not accurate. Many of the most energetically critical ones attribute arguments to the author which he is not attempting to make, and also, they ignore his extensive clarifications about the design of the study, margin of error, etc. To suggest that this book is based on \\"bad science\\" is simply a lie.    This book makes remarkably strong arguments which also happen to undermine a handful of overlapping multi-billion dollar industries: status-quo traditional medicine, big pharma, big Farmer etc.     The case for eating a plant-based diet presented here is the strongest, most well-substantiated I have ever read. Beyond the science and nutrition information, the author presents some very interesting first-hand history of the politics of U.S. dietary guidelines and the powers-that-be who have traditionally shaped them. The anger the author encountered from those who are supposed to have the health of the public at heart (government, lobbyists, and doctors) when he initially showed support for the ideas that form the basis of this book are especially damning and a little depressing. Those were the parts that pushed me over the edge into a trail period of veganism.      Thanks to the authors. You have done good, lifesaving work here.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|This is a fun movie. Betty White steels the show. If you are in the mood to have a good laugh or just need a good pick me up, this is the movie for you. You owe it to yourself to see it. I know, it is predictable at times, as most movies are. But, I really don't care. This is a laugh out loud, make your sides hurt, and your eyes water movie, and those are few and far between. And the best part is the whole family can watch it. Enjoy!

B00000IL1K|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this CD, shipped very quickely to me and plays excellent! Clearly one (if not the best) albums that Sarah Brightman has ever done. With her powerful angel voice, she will seduce you!
031606792X|3.0|Ok... So I really enjoyed the first three books.  I couldn't put them down!  I am a little against the grain when I say I am right in between Team Jacob and Team Edward.  The author could have easily persuaded me either way.  It seems like she was on the fence herself and therefore kept me on it.  I am 28 years old, and definitely see how this is written for a younger audience... however, that did not stop me and I thoroughly enjoyed myself!    I was somewhat disappointed in the forth book, Breaking Dawn, because of a few key points:  The pure, rugged, passionate Edward that we grew to love in the first 3 books dissapeared in this book.  What made me love him was his passion and his raw feelings for Belle.  It seems in this 4th book it is a bit too \\"controlled\\" for my taste.  He is a mild little puppy in some ways... and just an \\"object for affection\\" you could say.  Secondly, we sense Jacob's true rugged feelings in this book for the first half, but after that he, too, is just another character.  3rd, the plot for the end takes up way to much time because of formalities (introducing more characters) rather than playing on the complications in relationships between the Cullens and the Blacks, etc.  The closeness just wasn't there.  4th, although the buildup to the end was really cool... there was much to be desired.  It was little long getting there, but it eventually got to the \\"finale.\\"  I definitely felt closure at the end of the book... but I would still like to know more about certain characters' futures.  In conclusion, if you have read the first three books, you have to read this one.  However, don't cancel your plans for a few days to read this one.  Unfortunately, you can take your time and set this book down.
B000002J6H|4.0|Amazon.com, shame on you, why did you feature Gavin McNett's misleading review? Stephen Stills is the most versatile and talented musician in CSN&Y. The others are great specialists in their styles, but Stills is the best all-around musician. He holds his own in the tracks with Clapton & Hendrix. So, Graham Nash is more talented? Really?

0307588335|5.0|Lawrence McDonald was a bond trader at Lehman Brothers during the critical years before the collapse.  He provides us with fascinating insights into what was going on at the firm and how its collapse came about.  If you want to know more about what it is we have just been through with the American economy, this is one of the books you should read.<br /><br />The book has four interweaving threads that each contributes its part to making the book interesting and valuable.  The author tells us the story of his life with his childhood as the son of a man who traded as a bear.  Mr. McDonald learned from his father, and after a youth spent meandering a bit, he ended up wanting to get into trading.  We follow him through sales, how he became certified, and how he aggressively and creatively got his first gig on Wall Street.  He made his first big splash by staring a web service that rated convertible bonds.  He and his friend were so good at helping the public avoid buying bad deals that Morgan Stanley bought them.  We also get to follow him to Lehman Brothers where he got to work with his childhood friend, and brilliant trader, Larry McCarthy.  McCarthy, along with Mike Gelband, and a couple of others are the primary heroes of the book.  I think one of the attractive aspects of this book is McDonald's being open about his triumphs and goofs and freely identifying others as heroes while leaving himself primarily in the role of witness and reporter.<br /><br />The second thread in the book involves his time at Lehman and how he became aware of the massive problems Fuld and Gregory were creating by buying massive amounts of real estate paying top dollar at the top of the market using borrowed money.  Needless to say, Fuld and Gregory are the bad guys in the book and the author lays the failure of Lehman at their feet, not only because of their bad business decisions, but also because of their personal arrogance.  If Fuld had taken offers to sell Lehman, he could have saved not only the company, but also the money of people who had their life savings in Lehman stock.  More than that, the author shows us how the contagion of Lehman's failure contributed to the near collapse of the global economy.<br /><br />The third thread is the explanation of the investment vehicles and corrupt rating companies that allowed Lehman (and other companies) to massively leverage their assets and pretend that it was all riskless.  At the end, Lehman was leveraged more than 44 times their actual assets.  As you read about the creation of the CDOs, SIVs, CMBs, and the off book Caribbean banking hideaways Lehman used to hide their losses, you may well become physically ill.  Be forewarned.  This is crazy stuff that helped contribute to the destruction of your own retirement accounts.  He also shows us why repealing Glass-Steagall was an awful notion that led directly to the massive risk taking by all banks and put tremendous pressure on investment banks to compete by taking on more and more leverage.<br /><br />I think the wrong lesson to draw from this book is that this collapse is the inevitable results of \\"Reaganism\\" or \\"capitalism\\".  No, it is not.  True capitalism involves risk and reward.  It involves losses as well as profits.  What Fuld and others in the current financial (and big business regime) have done is to gather outsized rewards for themselves while transferring the risks and losses to you and me.  That is not capitalism. nor a free market.  It is a distortion of capitalism and free markets by using distorted regulations (where good regulation is really needed) and complicit politicians to distort markets and honest risk taking.  Markets require market discipline.  Bad decisions must be paid for and it should be paid for by those who made the bad decisions.  In a more sane time bankers were risking their own money (and their depositors' money, to some extent) and wanted to be sure it was safe and would be paid back.  When Fuld et al could makethemselves into potentates using other people's money and could pretend that there was no real risk, the market discipline and personal responsibility were destroyed.<br /><br />This is a very good book and I encourage everyone to read it.  While there is a tiny bit of investment jargon, you will pick up on it easily and find that learning what was really going on in the Wall Street banks is worth the effort.  Be warned, though, what you will read will scare you almost to death.  At least it did me.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MIes using other people's money and could pretend that there was no real risk, the market discipline and personal responsibility were destroyed.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and south was in my wish list for 2 or 3 years. one day I decided to order it. I never thought that another movie could replace P&P but North and south did! it's like that perfect recipe where nothing else is needed and nothing can be taken away. It is truly a masterpiece.and I own a good sized collection of period drama. I have lost count of how many times Ive seen it.I cannot imagine anyone else playing the leads as Armitage and Denby-ashe have. Amazing.

Simply open the book and let the pages fall where they may for your daily message from your Angels or read it through from beginning to end like a book.  I have found that it is coherent with what is going on in my life each day.  Again, great tool.  I also would recommend getting affirmation cards that are portable, such as Louise Hay.  In Munay.
0151013837|5.0|Oh. My. Goodness.<br /><br />This is the kind of assigned reading they should have in schools. This book had so much to offer psychologically, symbolically, and philosophically and yet it was a FASCINATING story. If you really wanted to, you could read it exactly as it's written, just a story. But you have the ability at the end to go back and see everything with wider eyes.<br /><br />Boy doesn't like his name. Boy gets trapped on a lifeboat with a tiger.<br /><br />That's all I knew.<br /><br />I started this book in the evening, and finished it the next morning(after staying up all night). I was that enraptured (Plus I had to have it finished by that morning for school. Heh.).<br /><br />And even if you're going through the whole book going \\"What in the world is going on?! I'm so confused.\\" know that it's totally worth it at the end.<br /><br />MY WARNING: It really helps if you read this book and then have someone to discuss it with. I would recommend an entire book club. For me, I had my mom. I would have been completely shocked and frozen by this book if it hadn't been for my mom telling me, \\"Calm down, this is what happened:\\" Also, there's a bit of gore. After all, he had to kill his own food.<br /><br />Ah! I loved it!

B002C6K7NU|3.0|I know I'll probably be in a minority with this, but I heartily disagree with the sentiment behind the title track, God & Guns, and even moreso that they used it for the album's title.  Whatever happened to Ronnie's sentiment in \\"Saturday Night Special\\".... \\"why don't we dump'em to the bottom of the sea / before some old fool come around here / try to shoot either you or me\\" ??  When Johnny sings about a \\"peacemaker\\" in your bedroom drawer, he's not talking about a hunting rifle.  A bible in one hand and a handgun in the other?  Only a hair's breadth removed from the mindset of any Muslim extremist as far as I'm concerned.    The rest of the album is pretty good, but not great.  I think the previous record, Vicious Cycle, was much stronger.  Standouts on this one are \\"Still Unbroken\\" and \\"Skynyrd Nation\\".  Johnny sounds just a trifle strained in a couple spots, and his voice also seems to overpower the mix here and there.  A couple of the lyrics, ballads notably, are a bit sappy for my taste.  The extra studio and live tracks on the 2CD edition are all very good.  All in all a respectable addition to their history, but not the 5-star raves that some others have given it.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|I heard a lot of good things about Slumdog Millionaire.  It also made me excited to know AR Rahman did the soundtrack.  Despite the fact the film was not well received in India, I was going to give it the benefit of the doubt.        Unfortunately, I could actually see why this film was not well received in India.    The film portrayed mostly poor people in India.  In addition, they made it seem like the majority of the officers were corrupt.  I tried very hard to not let these quirks get in the way of the plot.  After all,  in any poor neighborhood - including places in the United States - these things are bound to happen.  Stress levels are higher, there generally is less reliable help from authority, and so forth.  This can safely be generalized to most places in the world where there is a low-income neighborhood and a high crime rate.  I have not done any research on the statistics in Bombay/Mumbhai, but despite the overemphasis on poor people in India, I was willing to put this reservation to the side.  I even bit my tongue when I saw the Muslim fanatics attack people and saw the main character make a comment about blaming Rama and Allah for his mother's death.  (I will say this, though: the inter-caste violence is generally more infrequent than people in the West make it out to be and even then, it is usually reserved to the rural population.  In almost any society, social norms are more rigidly enforced when you get away from the more populated and diverse areas.)      What really turned me off was the scene when little Jamal was conning tourists, only for the police to publicly beat him.  Some cops might abuse their authority, but I really do not think the developed parts of India would have this happen a lot.  Following this was the young Jamal made the comment to the tourists, \\"You wanted to see what the REAL India is REALLY like?\\"  After this comment more or less helped me make my decision on the degree of stereotyping.  The tourist responded via giving cash to Jamal and saying, \\"This is how the real America is like!\\"  I may have not quoted the scene word for word, but this is how the scene went.  This part of the dialogue really made it obvious that the script writer and film maker over-stereotyped.  It also shows a lack of consideration for the non-profit institutions in India that actually -do- help the poor.  But like America, people in other countries cannot help -all- of their population.       This major \\"turn off\\" aside, the plot was interesting and I am always up for something dealing with the gray aspect of society.  It really shows what could happen to the homeless when people do not pay any attention to them.  Furthermore, I think the main characters show how far people will go to survive when put under the circumstances many homeless and poor people endure in the city slums.  I think someone already said the only unlikely thing that happened was Jamal becoming a millionaire...despite this, almost everything else seemed a pretty accurate portrayal of this environment.      Sincerely,  Arya Nightingale

There was a mystery, a hero, his helpers, his villains, puzzles (I LOVE Dashner's puzzles), an apocalypse, a twist, monsters, and some violence. Honestly, I don't think this book was missing anything. The only thing I wish was different is that I wish it was longer. Then again, I read it in two days, and whenever I do that I tend to think the books are really short when they aren't. Plus, I was so excited by the end of the book that I just started to skim. I'm definitely going to have to re-read this one.

Loved the stronge female role of the Confessor played by Bridget Regan, who often steals the show in many of the first series episodes appearing to be more talented, fight wise, than the seeker. What I like about the series is that all the episodes all tied up quite neatly. You are not left thinking, what was that all about, why did they include that, or they never explained this... etc. Really good, looking forward to the next series.

B001NXDSLQ|5.0|This film doesn't have all the best songs by the performers at Woodstock, but what it does have far outweighs all that we've seen before. It's a real, organic telling of how Woodstock happened, gives a feeling of having been there as it morphed and progressed from an organized event to a gathering of the tribes into a nation, and doesn't gloss over the mud or freakouts, the logistic nightmares or any other problems. This is the closest thing I've seen to having been there and reliving the magical event.

0375703764|1.0|HOUSE OF LEAVES is a postmodern horror novel by Mark Dalielewski which, unless I am mistaken, was first published on the internet and which gained a cult following, to at last be published traditionally, with original different typefaces, colors, and orientations.<br /><br />It is in essence two (or three) stories in one: ostensibly, the transcribed tale of a haunted house, as recorded by those who lived here. That story is fascinating and somewhat original, if seemingly unresolved.<br /><br />However, unfortunately, that tale is overlaid with the story of the person who finds the notes of the original transcriber. With the transparent name of Johnny Truant, he is vulgar, drugged-out, insipid, and completely off the track of the main narrative. His slow descent into madness does not actually seem connected to his work with the notes, and also seems reasonless as far as the reader can tell. Mostly, we suffer through stories of his many....many....MANY.... pointless and graphic one-night stands.<br /><br />I'm nowhere near done reading, but OMG it is getting annoying. What started out interesting--the feeling that the book was itself a journey, wending slowly to an unknown end--has become frustrating at pg.150 when I feel like I have been reading for-EV-er and not getting any closer to anything....further and further from reality, which of course is the point, but oh my GOD do we really need 7 pages on the etymology of the word \\"echo,\\" scratched-out meditations on the Theseus myth, pages after pages of listed buildings, upside-down pages of films? The reader has to turn the book upside-down, read backward, squint, etc. to come away with....NOTHING. It's just annoying at this point.<br /><br />Worse than postmodern: pointless.<br /><br />__________________________<br /><br />Okay, I finished it, and no, it didn't get any better. There's a quote at the end that \\"it is the commentaries on Shakespeare that matter, not Shakespeare.\\" Well, this book is definitely for people who'd rather read the commentaries than Shakespeare. Instead of a haunted house story, we have deconstructions of the meanings of a film about a haunted house (that may or may not even be true). Blah, blah, blah. Okay, I think there were a few neat moments, but only about 3 of them in an entire 656 page book, and all of them toward the beginning. Also, I will say this author's ability to speak in many different voices was brilliant, and his concept that the empty, unknowable darkness in the house is the existential empty, unknowable darkness inside all of us is very original. But it could have been told flat-out as a good story, not a bunch of postmodern notations (many of which later turn out not to be real....or are they? No, they're not. Wait...yes, they are!) Ack. I saw no reason that reading the \\"manuscript\\" would make anyone go insane... And in fact it didn't seem to make anyone but the meth addict go crazy, and he was genetically predisposed anyway. Etc. Etc. ad infinitum ad nauseum. I thought this book was incredibly hollow and pretentious, a good effort that still managed coming off like something I might have written in graduate school (my postgraduate thesis was on postmodernism), that would have benefited from a cut of some 200 pages.speare.

0385504225|1.0|I really enjoyed his first 4 books (Angels and Demons was my favorite). So as not to cover ground previously gone over - let me just mention what I think is the most disappointing thing about this dreadful novel (aside from the anticlimactic-pointless-banal-you've got to be kidding- ending followed by a second longer and oh so boring ending attached).  The best part of The DVC and A&D was their use of existing art and architecture to provide clues and keep the mystery churning. They always made you want to see these statues - buildings - paintings etc. Here there is a little of this at the beginning - but then the there is just a fictional, manufactured puzzle - a multi-part artifact that is a puzzle designed only to be a puzzle. What a letdown! Nothing to see in a new way, nothing to Google, nothing to learn or whet your curiosity. A little bit about murals and architecture, a little about Masons, a COMPLETELY irrelevant tiny subplot about a puzzle statue at the CIA that has NOTHING to do with the story... This was a really bad Dan Brown knock off. Unfortunately it was by Dan Brown.     And since I can't help myself - The final mystery wasn't one, and the big crisis wasn't one. If you or I were presented with the big crisis, I think most of us would stop, think, and say \\"um, OK, back to bed, goodnight\\".
B0026P3G12|5.0|She chose the songs that she wanted to sing, and sang them the way she chose. She did it all magnificently. There is a remarkable variety here and Ms. Boyle commanded it all into artistry. She created her own nuances and delivered them to us. Those who might have wanted or expected or needed something else from her need to find their own Susan Boyle and have her record it. I'll take this Susan Boyle any day. She is poignant, soaring, reflective, defiant, and all with a voice that is pitch-perfect, clear and enchanting. She reminds me of Eva Cassidy and Nancy LaMott, both lost to us now. They sound nothing alike - unless you're listening from a place far beyond your ears and your ego. Then they are all the sound of something that you did not know you were listening for - until you heard it. I heard Ms. Boyle this evening. I will be listening for her the rest of my life.

The censorship is awkwardly done ([...]) and will make you wince every time you hear it.  However, \\"Bad Romance\\" has been available for download in an uncensored version; your best option after buying this CD might be to combine the uncensored version of \\"Bad Romance\\" with the songs from \\"The Fame\\" (uncensored) and the remaining new songs from \\"The Fame Monster\\" and burn them all onto one CD.

B001HN697M|1.0|Vampires vs. werewolves seems to be the popular supernatural conflict in movies right now, but I'll give credit where credit is due -- \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" actually provides some backstory for that war. This prequel to the other two \\"Underworld\\" movies is a grimy, gloomy affair that has some good acting, but is drained dry by choppy direction, a flimsy plot and a love story that never quite convinces.<br /><br />Lucian (Michael Sheen) was the first of the Lycans -- rational lycanthropes capable of taking human form. Born from a savage werewolf, he was made into the personal slave/protege of the vampire lord Viktor (Bill Nighy). But things began to go wrong when two things happened: Viktor began breeding a new race of Lycans by infecting humans with Lucian's curse, and Lucian fell in love with Viktor's lovely daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra). The Lycans are treated like beasts of burden by the vampires, and rebellion is starting to stir among them -- and especially in Lucian, who sees them as his people now.<br /><br />But when Lucian is savagely punished for removing his slave collar (so he could save Sonja from werewolves), he decides enough is enough -- he and a small band of Lycans break out of the fortress and escape into neighboring lands. But he's determined to return for Sonja, whose affair with Lucian has been discovered by a horrified, grief-stricken Viktor -- and as the armed, organized Lycans clash with their former masters, someone will lose everything.<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" is sort of a werewolf \\"Ten Commandments\\" crossed with a bit of goth \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" -- basically it's about a rather straightforward slave uprising, and a forbidden love that obviously isn't gonna end well. The entire movie is bathed in gloomy shadows, rain and lots of pale anemic light; everybody wears weird pseudomedieval armor and lives in grimy stone fortresses that would drive most people to suicide.<br /><br />The plot also isn't terribly complex -- there are no twists or unexpected moments in either the slave uprising or the forbidden love affair. Both subplots go from A to Z with brain-melting predictability. What's more, the romantic angle is painfully unconvincing-- Lucian and Sonja start boinking out of the blue about five minutes after meeting each other, and they do it in a sewer. Apparently this is supposed to convey eternal true love... but it just left me thinking how gross it was.<br /><br />It also helps to ignore the choppy direction, frequently pompous dialogue (\\"Do you not realize that what I am giving you is a gift?\\" \\"It's a curse!\\") and dense melodrama (\\"We can be slaves, or we can be LYYYYCAAAAAAANS!\\"). Fortunately it isn't half bad at action scenes -- we've got big brutal werewolves, anemic noble vampires, lots of leather and metal armor, and plenty of necks being torn out with big bloody teeth.<br /><br />Sheen and Mitra both do good jobs as Sonja and Lucian, although Sheen yells a lot and Mitra looks terminally ill (would it have killed them to give the poor woman some lipstick?). While they do solid jobs throughout the movie, they are genuinely moving during their last scene together. Bill Nighy manages to bring some extra dimensions to a flat villain, by conveying his grief over his daughter's betrayal of her vampire kind, and Kevin Grevioux brings a lot of life to the smallish role of Lucius' second-in-command.<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" is a simplistic movie riddled with gothic gloom, goofy melodrama and a very flat love story.

B0012X6FR6|5.0|PORTRAIT IN JAZZ: BILL EVANS TRIO is quite simply GRACE in Trio form expressing itself as Jazz. There is an intensity at the heart of the music on this album - and an effortlessness. There is a BEAUTY revealing itself at every moment of the musical expression on this album by Bill Evans (Piano), Scott LaFaro (Bass), and Paul Motian (Drums). I purchased it on Amazon,and couldn't be more pleased with it. I've never been affected by a pianist as I have by Bill Evans. His lyricism, touch, the sheer depth of feeling he penetrated into, his introspection as an artist all combine into a quality, a presence - musically, that makes him, quite simply, one of a kind. He found his musical soul mates in Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian. They were together for only a moment. But thank whatever that is that brought them together. There's not much more to say. PORTRAIT IN JAZZ is musical perfection. Words don't quite get to the heart of explaining or getting a hold of such a thing as GRACE. All one can really do is to be hungry for it. And, when or if, whatever that mysterious force is, it chooses to present itself to us - receive it.
0385504225|2.0|Much of the book dwells on a very long sequence of grotesquely violent and bizarre attacks---violent crimes.  These appear to have no inherent value in themselves.  It is not obvious that they teach a lesson or give some insight into the darker side of human nature.  They appear, in this context, merely as gratuitous and mindlessly ugly violence.    Many great works of art have unattractive elements.  Even Beethoven's great Ninth Symphony has excursions into the minor key and passages that are troubling, at best.  However, great art more than offsets these excursions to the dark side.  The Ninth gives us the Ode to Joy that can hardly fail to awaken the greatest pleasure and optimism in anyone.  Because Brown has a long and profound excursion into ugliness, he \\"runs up a big tab,\\" and he can be expected to pay back for this with interest.    The coinage that he has available to pay us back, as readers, is the \\"Ancient Mystery\\" or \\"Western Mystery\\" tradition.  This is not simply verbiage to mislead children or gullible adults.  Something of great worth and importance---something real and valuable---is signified by the \\"Western Mystery\\" verbiage.  If Mr. Brown made that more real or more credible or more accessible to his readers, then he would have a great chance of paying back the bill he ran up with many early chapters of unrepentant violence.  In my mind, he fails entirely to give any substantial notion, and leaves the reader with the idea that this may all be smoke and mirrors, something designed in a cynical way, to sell books.  So, it could have worked---but it doesn't work at all.  It certainly would work for a reader who finds palpable significance in the \\"Ancient Mystery\\" area, as presented here.    I had the chance, months ago, to interview a very accomplished and thoughtful author, Dierdre McNamer.  I tried to play the villain with her, saying that fiction was itself useless, and so, unworthy of attention.  She was too kind of jar me out of my silly game.The truth is that fiction need not be garbage that is simply \\"all made up.\\"  Carefully constructed, it is the opportunity to hold up to mankind a mirror that shows a clearer vision of where we are, who we are, and where we're going.  A photographer can only photograph what is---not what is to be or what ought to be.  That's why we need art.  That's why we need real literature and meaningful fiction.    This book is not art, but it is extremely good business.  With Mr. Brown's previous track record and his publisher's business model, this book will be a superbly successful business venture.  That's what it is---a business venture.  It is not art.  It is not literature.  It's rubbish, and that's the kind phrasing.  It was wholly unworthy of the precious time I devoted to reading it.
B002MW50KO|1.0|I would like to start this review off by saying that I am a huge Bob Dylan fan and have been following him since 1962...I've only seen him live once and that was in 1965 in Baltimore.  Great concert....Now let me review this album.  These are all standards songs and if you like these songs go listen to the original artists.  I don't see where Bob has brought any new twists to the songs or any other arrangements making this cd a must buy.  His voice is strained and he has a hard time reaching some of the notes..Unless you must everything that Bob put out I really would not advise you picking this cd up...Bob is donating the proceeds from this cd to his charity (don't remember which one it is) so you may just want to buy it for charity sake.  I've listened to it once and don't believe that I will ever listen again...The only song that is half decent is \\"The Christmas Blues\\".  But please listen to the samples and make your own decision, I have made mine and filed it away...
B002ONC9MS|4.0|Carey Mulligan. Remember that name. In a movie filled with big name actors, newcomer Mulligan outshines them all and in a stunning performance that makes her a near lock for Best Actress nomination.  Set in post-war and pre-swing England, Mulligan brilliantly portrays a sheltered young female attempting to avoid the mundane and repressive lifestyle already laid out for her and seemingly every other young girl in England during this time.<br /><br />Mulligan's character Jenny is wise beyond her years and is being pushed along by her parents in pursuit of an education at Oxford.  When she meets David (Peter Sarsgaard), her world is turned upside down. He offers her a lifestyle of glamour, adventure, and sophistication that she has always wanted. She becomes blinded by all the glitz and glamour of this lavish lifestyle that Peter and his friends live. Seeing the limitations of women at this time, she begins to wonder what she is really working towards in her endless studies and cello lessons.<br /><br />The pivotal scene that really displays the heart of Jenny's troubles and the film's core message is when her father, who has been pushing her all along to get perfect grades in all her classes so that she can get into Oxford, admittedly says how she wouldn't really need to go to Oxford if she were to marry Peter, or essentially anyone who could financially provide for her.  What is she really working towards if all her studies and schooling mean nothing as long as she can find a wealthy enough man to marry? She is both scared and frustrated that all this hard work and dedication she has given to her schooling could ultimately result in her leading a boring life.  David represents an opportunity to avoid this and live a life filled with jazz-clubs, expensive auctions and trips to France.<br /><br />You can see the ending coming from a mile away, but the film is so well crafted and the acting so genuine that you can't help but be engaged from beginning to end.  With its all-star cast, led by a breakthrough performance from Carey Mulligan, An Education is an honest and heartfelt coming-of-age story that should garner much attention come Oscar season.<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryan<br /><br />[...]cast, led by a breakthrough performance from Carey Mulligan, An Education is an honest and heartfelt coming-of-age story that should garner much attention come Oscar season.    -Jeffrey Ryan    [...]
B0027WNRJ0|5.0|The album is great.  Sounds excellent with the remastering.  The live songs are great.  Packaging is great.  Everything is great.       However, why are songs like \\"Heaven Is\\" NOT in the live extras?  Instead, we get live songs from other albums.  I appreciate that, and I enjoy those live songs, but I've seen Def 3 times and never heard that song live.  Either that, or include other live songs from the album, vs. live songs from other albums (Hysteria).    I still gave it 5 stars, but the live song selection could be better.  Even still, if you're a Def fan, pick this up.  I still recommend it to any fan.  No question.
B002HWUU2C|5.0|Hansard and Irglova have magic voices-separate or together. I love the lyrics and the music and enjoy the sound with the Frames added into the mix. The live CD and DVD are simply wonderful. One of my favorite Frames songs is \\"Fitzcarraldo\\" and am thrilled to have it on the live recording-very exciting piece of music (the story behind it is, also, very interesting). A great value on every level.
1594200106|2.0|...with the 2 star/1 star reviews.  I don't know why this has so many raves.  I'm half way through and will probably finish as I don't have anything great in the wings to read, but I'm beginning to skip bits as they are so repetitively dark, Gothic, overwrought and, yes as others have said lurid.  For instance the story of Jacinta (in the institution) was just too over-the-top with the mystical, ghost ridden, devil cursed, awful fortune she'd had to live through. Why should I live through it too?  Maybe once, but we've been there with that a few times already in this book.  Just don't care about these folks, don't believe in them, the magical realism is neither real nor magical and the mystery is in no way compelling.  Yes, I agree--don't bother.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is awesome! It's perfect for someone who doesn't have alot of time but still wants to get a hardcore workout for the day. I recommend this for anyone who wants to get into shape and lose weight. It kicks butt!!
B001IBIQU6|1.0|Sounds of the Universe is like an unholy paring between DM's Speek and Spell mixed with Exiter. Much like human breeding, it is best if incest is not practiced. I wish they'd gone in a different direction stylistically rather than trying to rehash the dull and boring parts of Exiter with bleeps and bops of Speek and Spell.     I'm going to pretend this album doesn't exist in the DM discography.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|This CD has the Foo Fighter's greatest hits. From Big Me to Wheels, this CD is a must have for any Foo's fan. Very highly recommended!
B000PMLFRA|4.0|This is in response to some of the people complaining about wanting the original uncut and unedited versions on Blu-ray.    Are you people dense?    I have seen a HD version of the original episodes 4 and 5 and can without a doubt say that they really show their age. The sound was great at the time of it's theatrical debuts but is really lacking in the modern world. The same goes for the special effects.What was state of the art in it's day can not stand up to the scrutiny of HD versions including blu-ray.  Do you really want every flaw in the movie to be exposed in dramatic fashion. Do you really want to see just how much makeup was used on the actors faces. How about seeing the backdrop paintings lines as they run across the floor or to see how miss matched the colors in Matte paintings are compared to the foreground.    Some people have the wrong impression that what they see in a theater is HD. Wrong!!!  Theater projectors project a semi HD image on the screen, its actually just slightly more HD than a DVD version. But blu-ray disc and a good transfer will put nearly 3 times as much detail and information on a screen for your eye's to take in.  Under those circumstances the original films have more in common with buck rogers of the 50's than it does with sci-fi of today.   Here's another example of a scene where to much detail is bad.    Episode 4    This scene takes place on the death star and is in an imperial conference room. Tarkin and Vader are standing when an officer comes in to report that \\"they have reached Dantooine and found the remains of a hidden rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time\\". Now that you know the scene I'll let you in on the flaws you see with HD. When the scene starts Tarkin is saying something because his lips are moving but theres no dialog. When the officer begins speaking his lips are saying something different than what his words are. Same goes for Tarkins response. Apparently Vader is making motionsand hand motions as if he is also saying something but there's no dialog coming from him.  The scene was perfect as it was during its day, but under the microscope of HD it is in need of some serious work.  Or how about seeing princess Leia with more rouge on her checks than Bozo the clown or better yet Han and Luke with rouge.   No Thank You.    I like them just fine on my dvd and VHS versions. Blu-ray will just destroy the mystique of the originals.  Enhancing them is the only way these films could ever be released on blu-ray.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Love it, though would like more \\"soaring\\"pieces to show off her voice.  Songs of triumph and sorrow that speak to us.  I have been very ill for three months and \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" really talked to me  - \\"the tigers come at night, with voices soft as thunder\\" and \\"so different from the hell I'm living\\" touched my soul.  \\"Up to the Mountain\\" soothes me.  Keep doing songs with messages that show off your beautiful voice.  I hope she does tour some day.  It would be nice to go go a concert just to hear all songs instead of the show biz hype.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie is incredibly enlightening, it is full of nothing but informative yet interesting conversations. Everything said in this movie has meaning and power behind it. It will truly open your mind.. to other things. To other dimensions..
B0013XS8A2|5.0|This album has it all...it's rythmic, sometimes soft, at times with a  lovely choir.  It is Mike Oldfield's best and is a joy to listen to this unique album repeatedly...and I DO!
1433502410|5.0|What a great Bible. Very easy print, maps, charts, and well worth the money. A great 2nd bible for anyone studying the word more in depth. An overall best value of all bibles I have seen.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|Worked right out of box, after simple setup.  It is setup in an office environment with a Microsoft domain.  I do recommend this item.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|I fully expect to go back and forth on the relative merits of individual songs in this classic set. At the moment, Paul McCartney's tuneful craftsmanship appears to win the day over John Lennon's heroin-laced soul-baring, simply because some of Lennon's tracks come off as unfinished by comparison, but on another listen the reverse might be true. What isn't arguable is whether this holds together as a cohesive group effort; it does not. The individual Beatles were each moving in different directions by 1968, and the strain shows: on a number of tracks, for example, McCartney doesn't even enlist the aid of his ostensible bandmates, but instead overdubs himself into a one-man quartet. As producer George Martin put it in Bob Spitz's excellent Beatles bio, \\"I was recording not a group of four, but three fellows who had three accompanists each time.\\" Funnily enough, even \\"Abbey Road,\\" recorded just before the group splintered apart, conveys more the feeling of a band, even if a band on its best behavior.    Yet even as there are tracks that by the Fab Four's standards sound a little dull or uninspired, you also have \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" \\"Helter Skelter,\\" \\"Julia\\" and \\"Revolution 1,\\" all of which rank with their best. (\\"Revolution 9\\"--or should I say number-nine, number-nine--does not impress as much as it once did, although the remastered sound allows you to hear Lennon's collage with scary clarity.) And the cornucopia of musical styles puts this 2-CD set into a class by itself among the Beatles canon. About the 2009 remaster: having never heard the \\"White Album\\" LPs (whether the original or a Mobile Fidelity reissue) on a state-of-the-art turntable, I can't say whether these new CDs represent the ultimate. But they sure wipe the floor with the thin, two-dimensional sonics of the 1987 version.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Awesome, love it, totally worth the money. I tried twice to buy this product from different sellers. Both fell through and I got to experience the wonderful process of internet fraud for the first time. So I decided to just buy it from Amazon, knowing that I wouldn't be let down. I was right! Everything it said it was. Plus I love this show now! I'm into the third season :) This show has wit, intelligence, and I've actually learned some things from this show; C.J is my favorite ;)
0451529308|5.0|When my book club selected this book, I didn't want to spend alot of money on another copy since I had already read and thrown out 2 others.  When this one arrived (earlier than expected) and in perfect condition, I was delighted.  I decided that I am going to keep it in case my grand daughters want to read it when they come to my house for a summer visit. Many thanks!!!
B002OB9KPE|3.0|I've been waiting for years for this CD.  Parts of it are incredible, while other parts are eh able.  Some of the songs are excellent - such as Overture/Whirlwind, Evermore, and Is It Really Happening?  from the first main disc, and Return of the Giant Hogweed and Soul Sacrifice from the second (bonus) disc.  However, there are two songs I don't like at all - Rose Colored Glasses is incredibly repetitive and grating and Salty Dog, the Procul Harem cover, which I have never cared for.  The musicianship throughout is, as always, phenomenal, but I feel the material is more of a let down.  Still, it is good prog with a good message.
0375851569|5.0|Bought this set for a baby shower gift, was well received. Such a nice classic group of books to start off a little one with.
0571202284|5.0|It's really good, I read it immediately as I received it and started drawing straight after. It's fantastic.
0061730327|5.0|Amazon's editors have selected William Kamkwamba's inspiring tale as one the Top 10 selections of 2009...and rightfully so.  Though I'd known of Kamkwamba's story through my membership in TED's online site, Bryan Mealer's book vastly exceeded my expectations.  Most notably, through Mealer's skilled direction, Kamkwamba recounts the depth of the desperation that led to the inspiration and drive for his amazing windmill - notably, the grinding, near-catastrophic famine that visited Kamkwamba's Malawi in the early part of this decade.  What also comes alive through Mealer's guidance is the persistence of William's efforts to educate himself, despite his family's inability to finance his continued schooling.  When all the family's money and efforts had to go towards basic sustenance, William turned to the library and immersed himself into such books as \\"Understanding Physics.\\"  The sheer intelligence and diligence that lead from that book to William's creation in the most dire of settings and circumstances - no Hollywood tale can do justice for what he has pulled off.  Mealer's tale does justice to William's tremendous feat of perseverance and triumph.
B002MW50KO|4.0|Dylan's voice maybe cracked and aging but it works well within its limitations and, for me, Dylan totally succeeds in delivering shades of phrasing which ensures Christmas in the Heart contains a great deal of humour as well as pathos. Most of these Christmas songs are familiar but Dylan does revive their fundamental message and gives the meanings of the songs a new lease of life despite resorting to 50s style arrangements. While it appears that Dylan has yet again upset many of his fans, this CD should be taken for what it is - a Christmas album made specifically for charity and one to be taken of the shelf every December. Christmas in the Heart evokes a spirit of Christmas which might be nostalgic for something that exists in our imagination rather than our reality but is a Christmas album and Christmas concept very much opposed to the tinsel consumerism of the modern era.
B002MW50KO|1.0|I was actually very interested in hearing this disc of Christmas songs.   Might be quite good I thought. Some atmospheric Lanois take on the classics.   Bob using the better parts of his voice.    Then I heard it and OMG, what a train wreck.     Bob's voice is so shattered and tattered now it sounds like it would be acutely painful for him to even speak, much less sing these old chestnuts. If you want a mix of Harvey Fierstein and Tom Waits with bronchitis singing in your ear as you open presents with your kids have at it, but this has got to be the most ill conceived project of his entire career. Who released this thing anyway?     Wretched.    ps-love you Bob,merry christmas.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Extraordinary film in the true comic sense. Peter Sellers best film ever. George C. Scott is amazing. Sterling Haden plays the part to a Tee. I'll be watching it again before you can say \\"Blast Off\\".
0756655730|5.0|Having been captivated by fossils at a very young age I always have the desire to learn more. This book widens the scope of knowledge I thought I had and opens up even more fascinating areas of discovery. You will not be disappointed and will want to share this with family members young and old.
B00003CXA6|5.0|It's been out for years, but this movie still brings forth the reality of character, circumstance, and event of Gettysburg in a way that keeps us captivated long, long after the last credits roll by. Even though, in the four hours length of it, we are presented with only small samplings of what was a monumental three-day battle that continues to comprise more than any one human being can wholly comprehend in a lifetime, \\"Gettysburg\\" draws the viewer in to where s/he can't help but want to visit this place, walk these hills and fields, and read and learn more and more of what happened there, and how what happened there has continued to define who we are, even now, as a nation. At any rate, up until the very recent past ...
0307716988|3.0|I'm a great Michael Jackson fan and I was eager to have this book in my hands. But I was a bit disappointed to discover that there wasn't much left for me to learn about MJ in the book. If you have read \\"Michael Jackson, the Magic and the Madness\\" by Randy Taraborelli or have seen the mini series film \\"The Jacksons\\", then you know the vast majority of things written in this book. However, it is a must have for fans, since it's his life in his words, and it has a lot of great pictures and a drawing made by Michael himself. I also have the feeling that MIchael doesn't reveal much in the book, the contents are a bit light for my taste. In spite of all this, if you are a big fan, you cannot miss it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's exquisite voice is beautifully showcased in this wonderful debut CD.  5 Stars all the way !!!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|My words cannot compare to the earlier reviews of Xeno or Big Al - they nailed it.  Every moment of every song is moving beyond words.  Susan Boyle truly is a blessing and a treasure.  Her God given talent is remarkable and breathtaking.  Her vast range of emotions play out in every song.  I only wish she had another CD already in the making and ready to share with us.  Don't let it be too long please we need more!  Will have to buy another copy since I am almost wearing out this one.
B0014BECF8|4.0|I would have bought this only for the extended version of Everything She Wants, a guilty pleasure from the 80s that, like Abba's work merely a few years earlier, is so wonderful that you don't feel as guilty anymore. Everything She Wants could have been sung by Michael Jackson. Its teems with the same pairing of urgent R&B and obvious pop sheen that made Billie Jean stand as the most celebrated single of the period.<br /><br />If you were a child like I was when Make It Big was all over radio and MTV, you were in for an unwelcome discovery when you played the album on your home stereo. What happened to that great bridge, the climatic peak that builds to Michael's wail \\"I give you all, you say you want mo-o-re...\\". Assumedly, the format of vinyl prevented that 6:30 version from being waxed on Make It Big. Further, perhaps to maintain uniformity between formats, the full length Everything She Wants wasn't extended on copies for compact disc. So alas, that's how the track stood, stunted before its real greatness could be revealed, unless you sprung for the single.<br /><br />However, in larger part, this collection (i actually have the edition with a 3rd disc-For The Loyal) displays much George Michael that wasn't donned much attention at its time of release has aged incredibly well. There is so much of it, sequencers opted to omit the artist's defining 9 minute, I Want Your Sex, figuring, assumedly, you already had it on the Faith album anyway. Normally, this kind of omission on a best of is the collections downfall but TwentyFive is able to truly soar, perhaps by virtue of it. Familiar songs like Father Figure, Careless Whisper and Freedom 90 are enough to provide the measuring stick of discovery to how much Michael that you didn't remember, is actually consistently masterful pop music.<br /><br />Michael's tabloid presence has shadowed him from celebration for a lot of people, and it is a damn shame. Few artists of the past 30 years have maintained over such an extended stay in the spotlight with songs that have aged so well. Listening to them in succession is overwhelming for any pop fan and it is hard to imagine Michael eventually won't be remembered more properly.<br /><br />Faith is still the place to start. However, if afterward you don't want to collect each individual album, you will after hearing this.ght with songs that have aged so well.

B001RTP48G|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the PSBs since 1985, and rarely have I ever been disappointed with their new projects.  This is yet another great new album from this group.  Great pop sound, yet complex and beautiful.  \\"Love, Etc.\\", \\"Vulnerable\\", \\"King of Rome\\", are some of my favorites.  Anyone who likes some of their music will love this album. - JL
B0026P3G12|5.0|I pre-ordered the album, received it yesterday and am astounded.  Susan has the voice of an angel.  Most of the songs gave me chills.  I love the classics she chose and the hymns.  So  many people get to the top of the charts without any talent, it's a shame.  But this woman has amazing talent.  I'm so happy for her success.  I  hope she continues to produce albums, richer and deeper than this one.  I pray she stays humble and sweet.  Can't wait until the next album!
B002VECM36|4.0|About halfway through this film I realized even though I've seen a lot of kung-fu movies, I haven't really seen too many \\"ninja\\" movies. In fact as inherently cool as ninjas are, other than the pseudo ninjas in Batman Begins, I can't really recall ninjas ever being featured in a major studio film. Ninja Assassin corrects this egregious error. This is a straightforward \\"B-Movie\\" revenge flick with some pretty gruesome CGI enhanced fight scenes. The plot is flimsy and the acting spotty, but I went to see people getting sliced in half by katanas and by God did I get what I paid for! I can only hope that this film leads to a sequel, which will hopefully have more of a plot and fewer one-dimensional characters. But they can keep the excellent, stylized ninja slicing CGI fights!
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|This is such a fantastic movie, and everything a Science Fiction movie should be!<br /><br />The plot is very interesting. It brings back the Borg, the baddies of the universe.  Through a series of events, the Borg time travel ( Yes I know, in Star Trek, they travel through time like we change socks) to the past and plan to make the population of Earth all Borg. Well, Captain Picard and crew just can't let that happen. They travel back the same way the Borg did and stop them.  It seems that the Borg want to stop \\"First Contact\\" (that's when we met aliens for the first time) and we'll never make friends in the universe and it's easy pickings for the Brog to turn all of us into them.  That's pretty much all I want to say on what happens, I don't want to give to much of it away.  Just trust me, it's fantastic!<br /><br />This movie has it all.  It's chuck full of suspense, jaw dropping stunts, and some really interesting plot twists and some old fashion action.<br /><br />I really liked the story line of Picard's obsession. It was linked to Moby Dick and Captain Ahab.  This just adds to much to the story line. If you didn't know there were two epys of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Picard was taken by the Borg, and was made into one of them.<br /><br />Now for the blu ray aspect.  Its' phonominial!!!  It has fantastic sounds.  The sound is so crisp and clear, again, it adds a lot to the movie. The visuals are out of this world. Everything is crystal clear and the images are incredibly sharp. The view can't help but to be drawn in.  I just have one small issues with it. The menu screen could have been so much better. It was just the Star Trek symbol, and then it looked liked you are in warp drive in space, going around the symbol.  I think that they really dropped the ball on this one. They could have done so much for the menu screen. They could have had the new Enterprise, the Borg, Data, the Queen Borg, the Borg Ship, anything. Anything would be better than nothing, and I feel that's what they have for the menu.<br /><br />Overall if you have a blu ray and you like shape images, and sharp impressive sound, then you need to get Star Trek: First Contact!have for the menu.    Overall if you have a blu ray and you like shape images, and sharp impressive sound, then you need to get Star Trek: First Contact!
B001OQCV24|3.0|I'm a sucker for \\"end of the world\\" type stories. And I'm familiar with Director Roland Emmerich's style (Independence Day, Day After Tomorrow, 10,000 BC) so I went into this film fairly confident of what to expect: a good premise with an \\"OK\\" plot, fairly interesting characters that are only slightly more than one-dimensional, and outstanding special effects sequences of chaos and destruction. What I got instead was essentially a weaker version of the film \\"Deep Impact\\" only with destruction coming not from the sky but from below. Remember, \\"Deep Impact\\"? It was that other asteroid movie--Morgan Freeman was the president--released around the same time as Michael Bay's Aerosmith video, I mean film, \\"Armageddon.\\"     \\"2012\\" does have the great effects sequences, but the pace is uneven and while it raises some interesting moral questions, such questions were raised in a much less ham-handed fashion in \\"Deep Impact.\\" If you do go to see this in the theater for the effects sequences definitely save your money and go to the matinee.
B000RJO58C|1.0|Rec'd movie within a timely basis but rec'd a HDDVD.  Wrote Movietronix but was told it was my fault that I should read better.  What ever happened to the customer is always right?!?!? Especially if the DVD was only a few bucks they could of had a customer for life but they lost this one.  I won't ever buy from them again.  I bought a regular DVD from Wal-Mart instead for $7.
0312370849|3.0|The author has a very interesting premise, and I learned a great deal about this topic of history.  However, the book was fairly predictable, and the last fourth of the narrative was nothing more than a romance novel.
B002T45VX6|4.0|I like Shakira, I was in Buenos Aires when she released her last album and it was kinda my soundtrack for South America. I like Shakira's Spanish better than her English though. She has good English, don't get me wrong, but I wish she hadn't sold out so much. That's what makes her unique. I love her beats. This is a great album for that, but I agree with several other reviewers, her other albums have more... uhm... soul. I'm a fan of [[ASIN:B0009K8L52 Dónde Están los Ladrones?]] and [[ASIN:B00097A5HW Fijacion Oral vol. 1]]. Shakira, te amo chica, pero por favor, más español.   I am glad I got the album, no regrets. :) I do recommend it. It's fun for bellydance practice too.

B001GKJ2DY|1.0|It does not pay to buy cheap-I did, and the DVD stopped playing after 3 minutes.  I did get full refund though. That's why I like buying from AMAZON..
B0029O08WA|5.0|Anyone who has read the book, knows that a melancholy soundtrack is in order... and even though they aren't the same tracks that are on Stephanie's website, this soundtrack still delivers. And it's not so \\"down\\" that you listen to it and want to slit your wrists or anything, I love it actually, slower tempo, new Muse song, Deathcab, The Killers!, and some other indie-rockin artists. Definately recommend buying this soundtrack. Last year I bought the digital Twilight soundtrack, but this year I wanted something tangible so i bought the hard copy and was happy with the \\"poster\\" type thing that jacket folds out to.
0307460444|5.0|Martha really outdid herself with this book!  It was agift for our daughter, who loves to bake and it's right on target with lots of outstanding recipies!  She used it immediately for a party for her inlaws (very demanding folks!) and they loved the results.
0385336950|5.0|I had read this author's \\"All Saints\\" recently and so looked for another of his books.  Although I preferred the emotional content in \\"All Saints\\" and his success in seeing through a woman's eyes and speaking in a woman's voice, the psychological and cultural material in \\"The Cloud Atlas\\" was mesmerizing !  The author did a magnificent job of weaving a dramatic story line and interesting little-known-to-me factual information of the Japanese balloon bombs that landed in the USA during WWII. He definitely added an important page in Alaskan history and geography.  His characters in both novels are well-developed and maintain the reader's interest throughout.  I now am anxiously awaiting Mr. Callanan's next book.  Hurry !
B002C1BHIO|5.0|What can I say?  The product arrived within a few days after ordering.  The cable has a \\"cloth\\" feel to it, much like appliance cords from the 1940's.  It works as advertised and the price was several dollars less than ones at the local Walmart, and half the price of cables sold at TV stores.  Would definitely buy it again.
B001VPJYZK|4.0|The quality of the DVDs are very good, sturdy, no skipping and single-sided, with clear picture and sound. If one enjoyed season 5, or would like to view it comercial free, then I would recommend this set.<br />As for reviewing season 5 of the show, I found the show watchable, but only just. I am dissapointed in the turn of events that took place in season 5, and where the writers seem to be taking the characters. I will not give away any spoilers so my review of the show ends here.<br />The DVD's however are as good as it gets for a series release and for a fan, I would definately recommend it. One star is missing just for my displeasure with the storyline in this season.
B002MBAJ4M|2.0|Maybe one of the weaker, if not the weakest, album of Gov't Mule. BaT lacks some punch songs; there are good cuts (Monday Morning..., Steppin'..., Forevermore -but this one is way old, appears on WH's album at Bonnaroo-) but nothing in particular as 'High & Mighty' had. 'Broke Down...' is not an appropiated song for Billy Gibbons to take part, neither something to invite you to hear the full album.    I find 'Mighty High' (the dub album) even more interesting. They could have done something better; they know it, so what happened this time?    A.
1416594787|2.0|I read Richard Dawkins latest book because I was drawn by the subtitle: \\"The Evidence for Evolution.\\"      Not surprisingly, I did not find much \\"evidence.\\"  Rather, Dawkins does a commendable job of \\"explaining\\" Evolution.  Moreover, I appreciated his considerable attention to universally-accepted science on such fundamental subjects as: plant and animal characteristics, radioactive dating, and plate tectonics.  Therefore, since all are in agreement on universally-accepted science, why must Dawkins open Chapter 4 by declaring: \\"If the history-deniers [i.e. which includes people like me who accept Intelligent design] who doubt the fact of evolution are ignorant of biology ... \\"?  That's like saying: \\"Those who appreciate the form and habits of reindeer are, nevertheless, ignorant of the reality of Santa Claus.\\"    On the specific subject of Evolution, Dawkins resorts primarily to \\"speculation.\\"  To illustrate, I counted no less than 83 \\"speculative terms\\" such as: maybe, my guess, highly plausible, likely/not likely, perhaps, no harm in asking, fair bet, wondering, pretty confident, suggesting, may/may not, might have, speculate, assume, if, seemingly, presupposes, possibly, cautious, inclined, take seriously, probably, surmise, somehow, something happened, believe, and imagine.    Dawkins spends a considerable amount of attention to equating \\"Evolution\\" with \\"great periods of time.\\"  However, why does he think Evolution has a monopoly on \\"billions of years\\"?  In fact, he conspicuously avoids even mentioning the now universally-accepted \\"Big Bang Theory.\\"  Why?  Because he knows that even our universe's estimated age of 13 billion years is not nearly enough time for the Theory of Evolution to take place.      While Dawkins frequently quotes Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" he confesses that he cannot identify the initial origin that the Theory is based on: the single cell.  Moreover, even given the existence of a single cell, Dawkins agrees with J.B.S. Haldane that \\"there is a mystery, merging on the miraculous ... in the very fact that a single cell gives rise to a human body in all its complexity.\\"  Yes, I like the word: \\"miraculous.\\"    Speaking of \\"Species,\\" why, is it that species are dying out on a daily basis, but since man has been on this earth no evidence of a single new species has been discovered?    Perhaps most baffling for me is how, on the one hand, Dawkins insists that the laws of Natural Selection are amoral, he, nevertheless, resorts to value judgments.  For example, in the Chapter he titles: \\"Arms Races and `Evolutionary Theodicy,\\" he agonizes: \\" ... if only hunter and hunted could sit down together and hammer out a sensible agreement, everybody would be better off.\\"  This empathetic commentary is meaningless in an amoral world based on Natural Selection.    Dawkins can't resist the \\"belief\\" (in the absence of \\"evidence\\") that aliens from outer space exist.  \\"My GUESS,\\" says Dawkins,\\" is that life is very rare, but that the number of planets is so large that we are PROBABLY not alone, and there MAY be millions of islands of life ...\\"  In the meantime, he completely ignores the  current 322 EVIDENCES for the fine-tuning of earth and its cosmic environment for intelligent life which makes it mathematically impossible for life to exist on any other planet than ours.    Finally, and perhaps most ridiculous, is Darwin's assertion that Evolutionists are being persecuted in American society!  The opposite is true, as portrayed in Ben Stein's movie: \\"Expelled - Intelligence Not Allowed.\\"
B00001R3GI|5.0|What can be said about a classic rock album like Exile.  So many classic songs I won't try to list them all and describe how each one is great.  Some songs are a bit muddled, in particular Jagger's vocals.  But that adds to the rawness of the songs.  If you are looking for Stones album, this is one to pick up, along with Beggar's Banquet and Let It Bleed those are the dinitive Stones albums in my opinion.
0307269760|5.0|This great ten story anthology looks deep into relationships with strong characterizations.  Nine of the contributions are under forty pages; only the title entry is longer at sixty pages.  As always Alice Munroe provides her audience with a profound collection.<br /><br />In \\"Dimensions\\" Doree grieves on the bus for her three children who were murdered by their father so they would not suffer the same misery he suffered of their mother leaving them.  \\"Fiction\\" stars Christie who tells the stories of her stepmother the music teacher in a published anthology.  \\"Wenlock Edge\\" college student explains how her roommate fools her into going on a dinner date with her lover.  Sally learns how \\"Deep-Holes\\" in marriage can become.  In \\"Free Radicals\\", Nita's friends are there at first while she grieves, but she rejects them; now she is moving on and needs them but none are there for her as they were hurt by her when they needed her.  His father stared at his \\"Face\\" once after he was born and never looked at his son's disfigured face again.  Young Mr. Crozier is surrounded by \\"Some Women\\" while dying from leukemia; but keeps a stiff upper lip so as not to alarm the female retinue who hide their melancholy from him while caring for him.  In \\"Child's Play\\" Marlene and Charlene become summer camp BFFs, but torture Verna until Marlene muses over \\"How can you blame a person for the way she was born?\\"  \\"Wood\\" centers on Roy who refinishes furniture, but works alone since he and his wife Lea never had no children. He is hurt and all alone apparently dying in The Deserted Forest.  \\"Too Much Happiness\\" centers on Russian mathematician Sophia Kovalevski who has found men limit her choices; still she writes stories in spite of her father insisting she is selling herself and obtains a teaching position in Sweden in spite of her lover living in Paris as she reuses to allow males to limit her.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

0385737424|5.0|I feel like there's a lot more I could say, but others who precede me in reviewing this book have said a good deal that echoes my own feelings about it.  Like many others, I am an adult reader and I also grew up around the same time as protagonist Miranda.  I was blown away by the depth of the plot, the intense individuality of the characters portrayed, and the concise manner in which the author conveyed a great deal without an overbearing amount of detail.  The pace of the novel never wavered.  Interestingly, despite the \\"fantastic\\" (as in \\"fantasy\\") nature of the story, the author managed to make the tale ring true.  I can't recommend this book highly enough -- but might have a tough time figuring out to whom I ought to recommend it.  Sophisticated beyond my seven year old daughter, and a possible tough sell for my ten year old boy (a girl as the central character, and no sports action, etc.), I would guess that a 10-15 year old girl would be the most likely recipient of this as a gift from me.  Don't know too many of those right now, but I may have to wait; I might feel a bit strange giving a copy of juvenile fiction to my own peers.  Despite this, however, I would recommend it to *all* age groups and genders.  For those of us no longer \\"juvenile,\\" it is a fun, quick read without being on any level vapid or shallow.

B000NA1OXY|3.0|...I like this album a lot-its a lot more fun than Under My Skin which I thought was dreadful-draggy vocals and mediocre. She definitely suffered from the sophomore slump. Avril's best is still her first-Let Go which had hit after hit! Each song was good on its own. BDT is fun, as is Girlfriend, I Can Do Better, Hot. I don't like how she sings When You're Gone-I feel like she sounds a bit sarcastic rather than pasionate. That could just be because of Avril's bratty image. I feel this album is girlie and fun and immature. I rather she stick with this style than go back to Under My Skin boredom style for the next album but who knows. I do feel that she can do better and yet I'm happy with what I have.

B0018RWMNM|2.0|Blu-Ray is awsome. Lonesome Dove is awsome. But this Blu-Ray version is missing key scenes. The scenes that I noticed are: The last scene of disc one is the Irish boy being bitten by snakes. The second disc opens not with him dying but with \\"Deets\\" (Danny Glover) dead with no expaination. Also key to the story is the hanging of Robert Urich's character which is not seen at all. I don't know what else is missing. Maybe a third dvd??

0470477237|5.0|I recommend Socialnomics to anyone who would like to better understand the business implications of social media. You may also find that it is a good book to recommend to anyone who is \\"on the fence\\" regarding social media. Qualman provides a good survey of the social media spectrum--from personal use to business use. He focuses mainly on the marketing benefits of social media. However, even if you are not a marketer, you will pick up useful insight. I found the very last chapter especially important because of its focus on using social media to promote one'(tm)s brand and focus on how important it will be for employers to understand how the next generation of workers (the \\"aeMillennials\\") will expect to interact in the workplace. If you are an employer, it is critical that you understand both the benefits and costs that social media will bring to the recruitment process as well as staff management.
B002SF9YUM|2.0|This movie (and \\"How to Be\\") makes me think Robert Pattinson is trying to be the next Johnny Depp.  I could see Johnny Depp in the role of Dali because he has a talent for eccentric roles.  Pattinson just doesn't cut it.  While the rest of the cast seem comfortable in their rolls, Pattinson constantly appears on edge and seems almost frightened to deliver his lines.  I'll be the first person to raise my hand and say that while Pattinson is very handsome, his acting skills are better suited for bubblegum teen movies or light-hearted romantic comedies.    It is an interesting story but the poor acting of the lead role takes away from that.

B000AS4L16|5.0|The contents of this DVD is usually only obtained in libraries, research institutions and colleges.<br /><br />If one desires to get a complete understanding of the Holocaust and it's result, there is not a better investment you can make!<br /><br />Unlike stereotypical black and white Army documentaries of the result of Hitler's \\"Final Solution,\\" \\"Shoah\\" brings to light the personal human stories of the Holocaust, both from the side of the surviving perpretrators and the victims. Also brought to light are the testimonies of the casual witnesses in the countries that were involved. It is far more personal than Schindler's List. It is over 9 hours of history in your face.<br /><br />No archival footage was used in this presentation. It was filmed in the late 70's and early 80's by Claude Lanzmann. He interviews hundreds of surviving victims, SS officers and native populations of that era. Vividly through filming of the extermination camp sites, the \\"De-Jewed\\" villages in Poland, the forests where hundreds of thousands were burnt and buried, he brings the Holocaust to us in a personal, gut-wrenching manner.<br /><br />This is especially important today. One must obtain a heartfelt experience of the Holocaust to appreciate the efforts of the hundreds of thousands of American lives sacraficed then to put an end to that mad \\"Thousand year Reich\\" that sponsored the industrial scale butchery of humanity. Relying on the thousand year hatreds of ethnic groups in Europe, Hitler and his goons fanned those fires in the hopes of \\"purifying\\" humanity of those they personally hated. Never in the history of humanity has this been possible until the Industrial Revolution made possible the machinery, technology and science required to make death an industry, where even the by-products of the butchery were a commodity.<br /><br />In this movie you will see aged Jewish survivors of the \\"Aktion Reinhard\\" program. You will see them open up to Claude. You will see them break down in tears as he makes them remember the horrors that will haunt them the rest of their days. You will see many native Poles of that era, now as old people, as they reenact the slitting of their throats- the sign that they gave the trainloads of jews as they passed by them on their way to Treblinka. You will see hidden camera interviews of some surviving SS personell of those camps. As these people are being interviewed, Claude takes us on a visual tour of the camp properties as they appear today.<br /><br />It is as if ghosts come back to life. We witness the ghosts of forgotten landscapes give up their dead to our view.<br /><br />I cannot more powerfully reccomend you to obtain a copy of \\"Shoah\\" whatever the price. These days we are assaulted by Holocaust deniers, whether thay are Neo-Nazis spewing their excuses and hatreds through the media of Community Television of the internet, or Presidents of countries! Worst of all, there are even regimes in the world who sponsor Anti-Holocaust conventions in their country to discount and deny the reality of the Final Solution. This film is neccesary for everyone to examine the truth and examine their conciousnesses. ONLY through personal experience that this film depicts can collective humanity purify their souls so \\"never again\\" can such inhumanity and horror be revisited upon the world.<br /><br />After viewing this film, you will never hear a train whistle in the same way again!<br /><br />Look at the cover of this DVD set. You can see that aged train engineer, and the sign Treblinka. What you can't see there is shown in this film.

0385737947|3.0|The Maze Runner / 978-0-385-73794-4<br /><br />Currently, Amazon seems to be recommending this novel if you've recently purchased and enjoyed \\"[[ASIN:0374324913 Lockdown]]\\", so if that's why you've been directed to this page, please note that the two books are - in my opinion - only superficially similar, so just because you liked the one doesn't mean you'll like the other. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />When Thomas awakes in a strange new land, walled in on all sides, and missing most of his memory aside from his name, both he and the reader are deeply confused. Are Thomas and his other companions - all boys - prisoners of society for forgotten crimes? Are they being experimented upon? All their needs are provided for - food and supplies are sent weekly as needed, and livestock and farms are kept to provide fresh meat and produce. Yet the boys who prowl the external maze every day face constant threat of death, and the small graveyard tended by the boys grows larger every day.<br /><br />\\"Maze Runner\\" is, I think, the sort of book I would have enjoyed more when I was younger. There is a lot of good material here, particularly the independence of the youths within their trapped society. Despite the unlikelihood that young boys would naturally make good farmers and livestock keepers without remembered knowledge, the point works well enough to underscore that these young people are intent on making a living for themselves, apart from the adult society that has seemingly cast them aside.<br /><br />There is a great deal here, though, that I would like to see improved upon. The first half of the novel is devoted too much to Thomas asking questions and the others refusing to answer them, as though the answers would be too much for his fragile sanity to handle, and as an artificial method to heighten tension and drag the story on, it is irritating. And then we have the stereotypical Lawful Idiocy sequence where Thomas is, basically, put on trial for being incredibly awesome, and none of it rings true. Thomas himself comes off as a bit of a Mary Sue at times, with his preternatural ability to scale walls and perform useful combat leaps.<br /><br />For the second half of the novel, though, the story picks up nicely and leaves behind the more annoying tics of the first half. There is a lot of suspense here, and the build up and eventual climax is exceedingly satisfying. The actual final ending, however, was quite annoying to me and without spoiling anything, I will just point out that I truly hate \\"right all along\\" justification twists to side-step actual, real moral dilemmas. Since this is meant to be a trilogy, the ending does come down on a cliff hanger, which normally I would dislike, but I found myself so detached at that point from Thomas, his companions, and the world around them that I found that I didn't care as much as I thought I would about their eventual fate. I'd like to check out the sequel, when it gets written, but I hope that this promising author can polish a few of his edges between then and now.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this book provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollrings true.

B002IR3PSC|5.0|What makes this dvd stand out to me, is the line-up with David Palmer and Barriemore Barlow. There hasn't been any other Tull dvds with those two members present. I consider this to be the premier line-up. Great playing under difficult circumstances being one of the first, or perhaps the first, world wide sat broadcast. Barries' playing is fiery and inspired. The band really seemed stoked to play. A must have, of course, for Tull fans and anyone else who enjoys seeing a band at the peak of their powers.

0738702994|5.0|I purchased this deck at Borders in winter of 2007. It was the first deck I ever purchased for myself, having been re-gifted a terrible, negatively energized deck from a friend the spring before, which I promptly burned and disposed of. This deck by Ferguson is very close to my heart. I have imagery from the 2 of Cups on my back, and intend to get the Priestess on my arm when she shows up in my present instead of my future. This deck always comforts me regardless of how bleak my situation may be.    The book that came with it is a gem, too; with much history and tales of Welsh / Celtic mythology.    My one complaint would have to be that the bag is pretty much worthless, it broke after a few uses, but that shouldn't matter anyway as it isn't very suitable for blocking out negative energy anyhow. (I had originally been putting the cards in the bag they came with, and then in a black bag of my own design- double bagged, if you will.)    Overall, still worth every penny.
0977476073|1.0|I don't get it.    Ford self publishes (?) the translation of a book , then self publishes (?) a book which criticizes favorably  his first book, has no academic credentials, claims that his is the \\"uncensored\\" edition, is based on subtleties of German to English translations which only experts can ascertain, etc. etc. etc. and we are supposed to believe this as the ultimate truth ? Is Ford both a native German and English speaker that can assure that his understanding of subtleties of both language are respected ?    I have read the Spanish translation and glanced at English translations. In fact the Spanish translation that I read quite carefully was published by Nazi sympathizers, so if anything it was inclined to a more favorable interpretation. Not being an expert I can say that from all these I concluded that Mein Kampf: is badly written, extremely boring, full of inaccuracies that jump at you, and overall seemingly the incoherent ranting of a lunatic. It is also clear that Hitler dragged the world into a lengthy war, which caused pain, death and suffering to millions people. So while Ford may even have a point regarding the subtleties of a word here and there, the overall conclusion for non experts remains; Mein Kampf is not a scholarly book.  Based on all the background available about Ford, I surmise that neither is his translation.    While debate and discussion of any subject is healthy, some form of sanity has to be maintained on how this is done. Expert discussion has to be left to experts, and should not be pursued by self appointed gurus. You wouldn't go to a butcher to get an operation, wouldn't get your car repaired by a watch maker, wouldn't build a house by a gardener and would like these to be vetted by some legitimate institution.   Non experts can voice opinions of course about any subject, but these should be considered what they are; \\"non expert opinions\\".  The reason why caution is needed is because the \\"opinions\\" of non experts may lead toquack medicine, flat earth societies, deniers of scientific facts and believers in racial superiority.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I kind of hesitated to give this even three stars, but I do think two stars is wholly unfair.  I have been a fan of Muse since Origin of Symmetry, which in my opinion is their strongest (most cohesive) album yet.  I loved the bombastic hits of Absolution and Black Holes, too--I really thought those albums were high quality.<br />This album, though, seems to be more like fan service than any sort of musical growth, to me.  I could sense Muse's (particularly Bellamy's) need to stake out a political agenda in Black Holes and while it's really strong in The Resistance (notably the first track, Uprising), I didn't think it was too genuine.  Most of the tracks seemed to veer off the political path and move more onto the romantic track.  At plenty of the lyrics, I found myself cringing.<br />To be fair, I am biased as I really enjoy the more grit-rock of Origin and Absolution and am somewhat hesitant to listen to more technically-enhanced music (although I wasn't opposed to Radiohead's experimentation am a fan of Bjork, and I hear no complaints of the Beatle's technology friendly progression), so this album ended up disappointing me on a very base level.  Whereas with Origin, Absolution, and eventually Black Holes, I did not find myself looking forward to listening on as the album progressed.<br />There is a big pro for this album, however.  I was really excited to hear more of Bellamy's beautiful piano solos.  A con?  Where is his equally beautiful falsetto?<br />I think the best way to sum this up is to say that the best track of the album is the first, Uprising, and it goes downhill from there.<br />My recommendation for those new to Muse is to go purchase [[ASIN:B000AMPZF8 Origin of Symmetry]] immediately if you haven't already!  It's one of those rare albums that's best listened to from beginning to end.
014017821X|1.0|I've always liked fairy tales and just recently saw the movie Company of Wolves for the first time based on a couple of these stories.  I had mixed feelings about the movie - it was weird, disjointed, boring, and yet sometimes intriguing all at the same time.  Certainly, it tried  - not entirely successfully - to capture a fairy tale atmosphere that not many movies have tried to do and I had to applaud the attempt.  It did succeed in inspiring me to try reading the book.  Similar to the movie, it was weird, disjointed, boring . . . and lacked anything intriguing.  The closest I came to a strong feeling about this was distaste since it read more like horror than a fairy tale and lacked any attempt to make you like any of the characters.  Cannot recommend it.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I love Susan Boyle and her natural voice, but that isn't what you have here. She is best when she sings boldy and unfettered, like in her YouTube video.

And Susan you have so  many \\"helpers\\" listed on your album - they aren't helping you.  And make sure they leave some of your income left over for you.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|After reading through the other reviews here, I had a good sense of what to expect (and what not to).  The watch's UI isn't the most intuitive, but after 15 minutes or so, it made sense.  My first run was great; although a little bulky, the 405 is very light and comfortable.  The real surprise came when I paired it with my Mac though...wow, what a great example of hardware and software designed under the same roof...very, very nice.  The only real criticism that I have on that end is distinguishing between [...] and Garmin Connect (where you get your dashboard and all data)...but that's pretty minor.  Facebook upload felt pretty clunky, but that's honestly frosting anyway.  As you'll read elsewhere, sweat and the touch interface aren't friends...and to that end I'd lock the bezel.  All in all, I could not be more pleased.
1416594787|3.0|This is mostly a \\"how evolution works,\\" book, rather than one devoted to providing evidence.  Yes, evidence is provided, but in no greater quantity than in any of his other books.  Jerry Coyne's \\"Why Evolution is True\\" is more narrowly focused on the evidence.    This isn't the Dawkins book that I was hoping for.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|Tarantino (sp?) produced his finest work in this gem of a film. You talk about creating tension? The opening scene builds it masterfully. The dialogue is interesting and the main villain (the Nazi general) is hilarious and great to watch. I especially loved Hitler's character, however...Tarantino knew to keep him under wraps, only allowing him enough screen time to reveal this man's insanity and fear.    The closing scene in this movie truly showcases Tarantino's talent. It's simultaneously tragic and triumphant, and goes from a low to a brilliant high in seconds.     He also managed to nudge in a few of his own political beliefs, particularly when the Nazi general labels the Inglorious Bastards \\"terrorists\\" in their fight for vengeance against the Nazi regime. I'll leave the reader to their own beliefs.     In all, it was a great, great film that I certainly would not mind watching again. I will buy the DVD.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This movie is wonderful to watch and the acting was superb. The movie is very clean and would be a film the whole family can enjoy. I would definitely recommend to my friends. The film was well done and the scenery is beautiful.

B000WZAE1I|3.0|In \\"Stardust\\" (2007) you will see a campy, funny, cross-dressing, sexually ambivalent Robert De Niro loose in a movie that at times is nutty and staggeringly stupid. De Niro is the captain of a pirate galleon that floats beneath a blimp. The village of Wall, England, has, naturally, a wall around it. Its only opening is guarded by an old retainer, a little guy who turns out to be quite tough when provoked. He tries to keep people from going to the supernatural kingdom of Stormhold (Faerie).<br />Tristan is the young hero who has walked through the opening in the wall to the magical kingdom. He finds the falling star turned into the young woman Yvaine.<br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, playing a witch/sorceress, is looking for eternal youth, and is on the trail of Yvaine whose heart may do the trick. Michelle's two sisters, crones, are always egging her on, and she turns into a crone as the movie progresses. She's always pointing a finger at someone, casting spells. She turns an oaf into a goat and later into a buxom barmaid. Oh, and there's a unicorn in the story.<br /> The Stormhold king has died, and his nasty son-princes are vying for the throne and are willing to kill for it. They go looking for the falling star girl who will give them magic powers and legitimacy. The glowing ghosts of failed dead princes go along for the ride.<br /> The film is full of chases and counter-chases which seem interminable and turn tedious. There are the three various plot strands that come together: Tristan, the witches, and the princes.<br /> There's some sly wit and humor. The buxom barmaid who's really a guy sneaks looks at Yvaine in the bath.<br /> Some of this flick seems labored, and it tries awfully hard to be fey. The repetitions of the bolts of light from supernatural beings become irksome. Is it a fairy tale with a lot of action for adults, a send-up, or just fanciful fluff? It's from a graphic novel with a cult following by Neil Gaiman.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is not #1.  She is #11.  She rocks off the charts with an unconventional, yet true to form commitment to her artistry taking #11 as the number I believe demonstrates her unique and limitless potential.  To say that I am in awe of her is an understatement.  I thank Susan Boyle for sharing her gift and for having the courage to rise above the odds.  She has given me an unforgetable and remarkable experience in simply listening to her sing.  Who I Was Born to Be moved me like no other song ever has, even beyond that of Susan's extraordinary renditions of I Dreamed a Dream and Wild Horses.  I humbly express my heartfelt gratitude.  With the sweat of my brow, I am ordering more of her CD's to share with friends, coworkers and family!  Sincerely yours, Tracy, Denver, Colorado
B000U0F7RG|4.0|Obviously love the series. However, I bought it off of Amazon and there is a problem with one of the discs that has yet to be rectified. I spoke with Amazon's customer service and though the man I spoke to was nice, he had little information and could not offer me a definite solution. This is quite disappointing considering what a huge company Amazon is. I am STILL waiting for them to fix this issue.
B00079HZUM|5.0|I'd never heard of this 2005 movie when I saw it on TV in 2009. What a failure of publicity! For me, it was everything 'Shakespeare in Love' should have been and wasn't. Billy Crudup, as the man who's been through a lifetime training regime equal in perversity to that in 'Mao's Last Dancer' or 'Farewell My Concubine,' but finds his skills superceded in his prime, is absolutely brilliant. He explores his craft and, through it, himself, taking us along for the ride. Clare Danes, as the woman who loves Crudup from afar but aspires to act the parts he plays, manages an incredibly demanding role with great verve and subtlety. It's hard to believe they are both Americans--they inhabit Restoration England as though they were born there. The rest of the cast are just as good, especially Rupert Everett as Charles II--full marks to the casting director. And the script was a joy to hear unfold. Witty lines and knowing insights emerge in every scene. If only there were more films like this! A completely satisfying entertainment experience.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Pure raw beauty.  Her voice is a cut above the rest.  This cd is a must have.  Her versions of these song do her justice.  I hope we will get to see more of her; and I hope she gets to stretch her vocals even more.  I'd like to see her do some classics like Ave Maria, Danny Boy and even see her venture into a bit more bluesy/soul style as well.
1416562605|5.0|I thought this book would be a preachy look at Indian society and the haves-vs-have-nots of any society.  Thankfully, it was so much more than that.  In part, a fascinating view of current Indian culture and society with the contrast between modernization and city-life and riches and education versus life-as-it's-been-for-300 years rural poverty illiterate culture.  Pulses with the vibrancy and craziness, beauty and heartbreak, promise and pitfall of modern India.  Also a compelling and entertaining story in its own right.  A great book club book.

B001DHXT6G|1.0|Bought this set for my husband for our anniversary. Was sent out first set that wouldn't play first season! Says HD Dvd on one side and standard on other. WELL neither side worked on season one. Tried it on both HD Dvd player and standard. Contacted Amazon, who sent out replacement set. Got before I even returned the first set. Opened first season only to have the same thing happene! Sent both sets back at same time. Amazon sent out third set, with promise of this set working. NOT only did season one not work. Season three did not work either! Got refund through Amazon. Found set through Costco for $40 LESS then Amazon! And it PLAYS! Amazon pulled sets to make sure they had working sets and is NOW selling them again!     BUYER BEWARE! If you have newer DVD player these WILL not work in your player/recorder!
B0026P3G12|4.0|I'm a big SB fan but this album is a little different than I expected. It's somewhat subdued and not the powerful, triumphant Susan Boyle that everybody fell in love with. A lone piano provides the accompaniment for the most part. And the title track is a slower and softer version than the one heard on BGT. The album is also a bit gospel-y which I don't much care for, but I guess that's just how Susan rolls.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|This is a true delight! Smooth and even, the sounds are almost eerie at times. But the cold, wintery feeling is balanced out with the emotions the songs invoke.

B000BB1MI2|2.0|Note: While I indeed like the percentage rating, I am refusing to rewrite this review, because I am way too happy with it to just delete it.  Still, I'm giving it a percentage.<br /><br />First off, I love Tim Burton.  Quentin Tarantino is cemented as my favorite director, but if I had to choose other favorites, Tim Burton is easily one of my other favorite directors.  Granted, he's not a genius as much as some of his saviors would like you to believe (you know the kind), and I don't rate all of his movies five stars or even four stars (Pee-Wee's Playhouse and The Nightmare Before Christmas are prime examples).  However, I think he's more than just some goth symbol.  He makes great movies that really have great visual styles, and for the most part, he's an inspired director and someone I can always count on for making something good.<br /><br />Except when he tries to redo other movies.  Granted, he's only had only one other re-make, but Planet of The Apes stunk up something fierce, and this one isn't much better.  I actually don't like the Willy Wonka movie that much either (I actually like the book more), but it's not a bad movie for good reasons, and there are parts in the movie that  seem very heartwarming (god I hate that word).  If felt engaging many times, and while it's also kind of dated, it still retains some form of engagment and emotion.  This movie, on the other hand, left me feeling cold throughout, with nothing to grab onto, with no character development.  Visual style can only take you so far, and while I liked some of it, it didn't do enough to save the film from becoming a total mess.<br /><br />This isn't a terrible movie by any stretch, but there's just not anything to grab onto.  Tim Burton is usually known for his quirkness and strangeness (boy, how dumb does that sound), but I always thought  he did so in a way that was always engaging, really making the world, characters, or situations come to life in some way.  In this one, the weirdness is there because he wants to be weird.  It does nothing to bring the world to life, just makes the world seem like a place that reminds you of a retirement home.  I actually have felt more emotions at a retirement home than this movie, I'm not even joking.  Plus, unlike the book which still had the heart but some of the deranged fun, this one doesn't have much with the sterile characters, and the two main people: Charlie and Wonka, being incredibly annoying on both counts.<br /><br />Ah, the annoying characters.  An example of this one would be the main character himself, Willy Wonka (?).  This Willy Wonka is just plain annoying and totally unengaging.  He has no real motivation in his actions, makes the stupidest and lame jokes, and just seems like the kind of person that tries to be all weird but in any case comes off looking like a person starved for attention.  The lame subplot about his father was also worthless, a backstory that made me feel absolutely nothing and did nothing to make me like this character at all.  Besides, when you don't give two _________ about the character now, why did you think I would care now?  He's annoying, he's weird because he can't offer anything else, and comparing the two characters makes you realize how much more soulless this Wonka is (The Nostalgia Critic did some cool comparisons, although I have no idea where the heck James Bond villian came from).<br /><br />I also liked the way the Nostalgia Critic pointed out how the Charlie character in this one is underdeveloped and annoyingly perfect.  This is a boyscout indeed, a kid that is so perfect and unrealistic that you just want to deck whoever put together this moron kid together.  As he said, the Charlie in the Wonka version (his name is in the title of the BOOK FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!!) is kind, but is more like a kid.  He can get greedy, he is tempted at times, but really comes out at the end after conflict (at the end).  He's more like a real kid.  He's crucial to the story,which makes it all the better since he's engaging while the focus of this movie does not involve a character that's in any way interseting.  See above for that reason.<br /><br />However, there are some improvements, although most are on the visual front.  The whole chocolate River is much improved, the original version did very much look like liquid _________.  The river in here was extremely gloppy and looked very much like chocolate.  I also thought the gobstopper was improved, I mean, what were the original gobstoppers supposed to me modeled after.  The factory is kind of interesting to see at times, but not entirely all the time.  It's kind of a person thing, but I think it overall looks pretty cool for the most part, and Tim Burton knows his stuff (too bad it didn't save the movie).<br /><br />There are some plot points cleared up, and the character updates shows they weren't entirely lazy (Gloop is pretty much the same).  The updates of Mike, and ESPECIALLY Violet, are very welcome.  I also like seeing the kids come out after their survival through the factory.  However, Veruca Salt was not improved at all, as the one in the earlier version was so __________ spoiled and bratty that you wanted to beat for being such a bratty son of a __________.  And the opening parts weren't that bad either, although nothing special considering the characters weren't that interesting, so setting up uninteresting characters doesn't really make the movie better.  It would only count if the characters were actually interesting.  And when they do, there's not much screen time anyway.<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing.  The MUSICALS NUMBERS $U(% @$$!!!!!!!  The whole different songs played during each kid's demise are totally annoying.  Why Elfman why?  Oh.  _______ the Willy Wonka song.  Eh, at least it's better than A Whole New World.<br /><br />Sorry Burton, I love ya, but I'm not a patsy.  It's worth a shot if your a Burton fan, but if you are going into the movie expecting to see something akin to the original, you're in for a rude awakening.  I'm actually glad I saw this movie for some Tim Burton greatness scattered about, but there wasn't that much.  It's kind of too bad.  Oh well.  I'm glad Ed Wood was released on DVD in special edition.<br /><br />Directing: 7/10<br />Characters: 3/10<br />Improvements in visual style 4/5<br />musical numbers 0/5<br />plot: 1/10's engaging while the focus of this movie does not involve a character that's in any way interseting.

B002MW50KO|1.0|I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable.  The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!
1594488843|4.0|Pink provides an engaging and informative take on motivation and incentives - more precisely the right coupling/alignment between the two.  While, the concept itself is not a breakthrough in itself - books such as [[ASIN:1439149178 The Carrot Principle: How the Best Managers Use Recognition to Engage Their People, Retain Talent, and Accelerate Performance [Updated & Revised]]] focused on the need for appreciation and right incentive structures, Pink provides a more rigorous, behavioral sciences-based discussion.  Other books such as [[ASIN:B002C949KE Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions]] (cited by Pink as well) also has touched on similar topics, albiet a bit tangentially. Using the classic early experiments (Harlow, Deci's Soma puzzles) to frame the discussion, Pink argues that motivation has three components (autonomy, mastery, sense of purpose).      The rest of the book is essentially a discussion into this separation and an underlying argument that incentive structures should align with these elements to succeed, else, they are likely to be counter-productive.  He then provides his version of an upgraded motivation system based on intrinsic motivation (Type I) and provides a more detailed discussion on the three elements (stated above) of motivation as it pertains to his Type I motivation system.  Part 3 of the book (while very informative, but seems a bit disjointed at times) is a toolkit that provides several suggestions/strategies for the individual and organizations to improve their approach towards motivation, with specific chapters for parents/educators and a conversation starter guide on motivation.     Overall, despite the sometimes forced analogies to operating systems and software upgrades and Newtonian physics (docking 0.5 stars), Pink provides a thought-provoking book, leveraging existing academic research and arguing for a new frame for thinking about motivation and incentives. 4.5*

B002L3RVCY|5.0|After an uneven debut as a movie, the computer animated Clone Wars show hits its stride.  The show covers the galaxy-spanning clone wars from several angles.  Whether a space battle against an enormous battleship, or a down-to-earth fight as droids infiltrate a clone stronghold the show manages to tell good stories in a short amount of time.<br /><br />The show keeps to the atmosphere of the films with their virtues and flaws.  There are amazing alien worlds and fantastic technology.  But there is some juvenile humor with the droids and an annoyingly perky teen Jedi but overall it is a strong product.<br /><br />The box set deserves special mention, not only is the packaging great but it includes a sketch book filled with art.  Most of the episodes include a 'making of' feature and many have an extended director's cut.<br /><br />This is a great gift for any Star Wars fan and well worth watching.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I don't want to give Susan any less than 5 stars because her gift is outstanding, and as a person she is beautiful. However there are two songs, (I Dreamed a Dream and How Great Thou Art) didn't live up to what Susan can really do. I Dreamed a Dream, despite how great it sounds, was a little disappointing because I felt that the song should be sung in its full version. The music accompaniment sounded synthetic making the song sound cheap; and Susan's gift doesn't need that. My biggest issue was How Great Thou Art. We just hear the chorus repeat itself over and over. I love that song and felt it didn't live up to the whole positive spirit it can bring when a powerful singer performs it. Other than that, the CD is awesome.     I can't wait for Susan to release her next album!    Perhaps Christmas themed?
0307346617|1.0|Maybe we've reached the point when gimmicks are all that's left? When just telling a simple story about characters the reader can care about is passe; and novels are judged on the numbers of characters presented, on quantity rather than quality? So here we have the gimmick of the interview style, each story told from a different point of view. What if the reader cares about none of them? No problem.<br /><br />Well, if you are aware enough of what makes a good novel you'll know this is not one. If you hunger for a character you can really care about and situations that will keep you enthralled, then try any Jack Vance.

0156027321|5.0|\\"I have a story that will make you believe in God.\\" - Pi Patel<br /><br />\\"I know what you want. You want a story that won't surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won't make you see higher or further or differently. You want a flat story. An immobile story. You want dry, yeastless factuality.\\" - Pi Patel<br /><br />This novel was easily one of the most unique books I have ever read and far from \\"dry, yeastless factuality\\". While reading it, I often wondered if it was not based off of a true story in some way simply because the story seemed too unbelievable to NOT be true! This book would appeal to a variety of literature-minded tastes as it covers topics that range from philosophy, religion, travel, and biology to suspense, horror, and even comedy.<br /><br />On the surface, the story is about an Indian boy that survives on a lifeboat with a lone Bengal tiger after his ship sinks, taking the remains of a zoo and his entire family with it. Woven into the plot are threads of Pi Patel's passion for religion as a whole. He seeks to survive - both mind and body - 227 days at sea, using both the knowledge of three world religions and the experience of growing up in a zoo.<br /><br />What makes this book rise above the general expectations of the fiction genre is that the main character's frequent monologues on his present circumstances inadvertedly cause the reader to evaluate his or her own life in light of Pi's words. Take for instance Pi's explanation of the battle between good and evil:<br /><br />\\"These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside. They should direct their anger at themselves. For evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out. The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart.\\" (Ch. 25)<br /><br />Page after page, chapter after chapter, Pi's personal philosophy is laid out as his life hangs in the balance. At one of his lowest points he discusses the power of fear:<br /><br />\\"I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. ... The matter is difficult to put into words. For fear, real fear, such as shakes you to your foundation, such as you feel when you are brought face to face with your mortal end, nestles in your memory like a gangrene: it seeks to rot everything, even the words with which to speak of it.\\" (Ch. 56)<br /><br />In the midst of reading this highly imaginative text, I realized that the musings of this castaway were reflections of what any person standing on dry land could be feeling at any given moment:<br /><br />\\"When you look up, you sometimes wonder if at the centre of the solar system, if in the middle of the Sea of Tranquillity, there isn't another one like you also looking up, also trapped by geometry, also struggling with fear, rage, madness, hopelessness, apathy.\\" (Ch. 78)<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was when in the midst of a storm, Pi was nearly struck by lightning. The description of this encounter in chapter 85 put me in nearly as much awe as it did Pi Patel and reminded me of how the Holy Bible often described the voice of God as the voice of a great thunder, which completely fit in with the overarching theme of religion as a framework for life.<br /><br />When at the end of the book, Pi Patel offers an alternate, more-believable version of his survival at sea, I realized that this novel could be read as an allegory to symbolize life and its survival. This is what truly allows The Life of Pi to make the leap from contemporary fiction to enduring classic.ower of fear:    \\"I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent.

0060763280|5.0|I've read very few books about rich people's views of wealth that explain it in layman's terms and offers you the tools to acquire the thoughts and actions as this one does. It works well as a self-help workbook and as a future reference manual.  I have also attended the Millionaire Mind Intensive seminar. For being infomercial in nature it still held up to it's promise to deliver the goods. Both book and seminar are well worth it.  Though I've purchased several copies for friends and acquaintences previously, I purchased this one through Amazon.
1594488916|4.0|This is an interesting book on book collecting and stealing rare books.  The thief of the story doesn't really \\"love books too much.\\"  Instead, he has a bizarre sense of entitlement and considers books a way to show that he belongs in the upper class society that he envies.  Bartlett has done a nice job in analyzing her thief, and while she gives some glimpses into rare book collecting, I wish she would have given more of a sense of contemporary collectors and what drives them.  The other part of the book that troubled me was how much she inserts herself into the narrative.  The book takes on an uneasy balance between memoir and reporting, between a book like \\"A Gentle Madness\\" and \\"The Professor and the Madman.\\"  Given the subject and her access to living sources, I think the book would have been stronger if she had stayed more in the mode of a reporter.  Still, it's a quick and enjoyable read, and fans of this brand of non-fiction should enjoy it.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|I'm looking for information about the 2 disc set Special Edition set but instead i find nothing but kudo's on the movie itself so guess i'll look somewhere else to buy since you could care less about giving potential buyers the info they need to make a decision on which to buy, if any.   oh & for those who are interested; neither Scotty,Sulu,Ohura,or Chekov delivered in their performances of course that's partially the fault of the writers; Sulu had a chance but didn't deliver,Uhura was never a loose woman,& the actor who played Scotty was never close to capturing the essence of his character. By far the BEST performance was for BONES by Karl Urban excelant capturing of the essence of the character, didn't ruin it like the others did,he just extended the role to fit himself.......

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I have to say this set is one of the most amazing discoveries I've found in music. To hear the original mono masters of arguably the greatest band in rock music is something to behold. I knew I wanted this set from the moment I saw that it was available, being a new-found lover of original monophonic recordings (The Beach Boys original \\"Pet Sounds\\" converted me). There are plenty of reviews already that speak about the sound quality and the various sonic differences between the stereo and mono albums, but to distill the impact I'm feeling, it's as easy as saying that the songs have far more punch in mono than they do in stereo. I've heard people complain that mono seems flat, but to me, it's not flat as much as deep. Specifically, the depth of sound that the band was able to achieve in one channel is astounding. My biggest problem with the old (and new) CDs is that the \\"stereo\\" that is presented is a very disjunct listening experience - with the exception of \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" which were only ever in stereo and sound FANTASTIC in their remastered editions. Of course the impact of that sonic depth is greatly enhanced the further into the Beatles catalogue you go. From about \\"Help\\" on, the band's growth as songwriters and arrangers becomes increasingly apparent.<br /><br />As far as the packaging goes, it's stellar. The album sleeves are meticulously re-created with care and love. Why EMI decided not to do the same presentation for the stereo catalogue escapes me, but it makes this set rather special for that reason. The CDs are missing the mini-documentaries which adorn the stereo catalogue, and they don't include the DVD that is in the Stereo Box. Still, it's not too big a sacrifice as the two documentaries I've seen - for \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" were pretty lame... most of the info I knew, and some of it I recognized from \\"The Compleat Beatles\\"... why that film isn't on DVD is criminal.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you're a completist or a collector, this set is well worth the price. Get it while you can!<br /><br />P.S.

0375842209|5.0|In the library, this book is marked for \\"Young Adults\\".  Too bad, because this is a good read for any age, and might be overlooked if in the young adults section.  I liked it enough to make it my choice for our book club.  It's what life was like during WWII from a poor German girl's viewpoint.
0847830942|5.0|My mother of all people gifted me this for my birthday this year. She knows I love bicycling (close to 5000 miles annually), but does not quite understand the passion. Still a wonderful gift. I own a custom built bicycle that was a 40th birthday present to self (cheaper than a sports car.) This book captures not only the beauty of hand-built and custom bicycle frames, but provides a nice history of European frame-building. This book is great for any cycling enthusiast who has affinity for his or her bike. Yes, it may be short in prose, but the photos are wonderful.
0199571791|5.0|Amazing book which explains revolutionary legal and constitutional concepts in post-Apartheid South Africa and how they are applied by the court. Written by a judge who was part of the ANC struggle against Apartheid. Section on Truth and Reconciliation is heart-wrenching.
1595141979|2.0|It's one roller coaster ride reading all these Vampire Academy books back to back like this. I'm actually starting to have trouble keeping the events separate and compartmentalized in my head. It all feels like one headlong rush to me. I maintain that the world itself is the real draw. I like how cold it feels, how dangerous and yet limned with the hint of hope and possibilities. The characters are full of potential and somehow keep their hooks in me despite the fact that I still feel parched in the depth department. SHADOW KISS is the third installment in Richelle Mead's very popular Vampire Academy series and, though it's taken me awhile to get around to reading them, I have blown through them without a backward glance.<br /><br />Rose isn't the same girl anymore. Having bagged her first Strigoi and watched her friend die at their hands, she endures the ceremonial tattooing process with an almost detached stoicism. The moment was in no way, shape, or form the way she imagined it would be. Dogged as ever, she presses forward with her studies, her training, and her dedication to her friend and charge Lissa. Despite the fact that she's now regularly encountering the shade of her dead friend around every corner. And having trouble controlling unusual mood swings. And not assigned to Lissa for her Guardian practical training. Instead she gets Christian and her friend Eddie gets Lissa. Having bonded with Eddie (and Christian to a degree) through the events at the end of [[ASIN:1595141758 Frostbite]], Rose manages to keep her lashing out to a barely contained level and directs her rapidly disintegrating attention to keeping Christian safe. As her anger rises, her last shreds of composure are shot to hell by regular contact with both doomed flame Dimitri and new St. Vlad's resident Adrian Ivashkov.<br /><br />This is the thickest Vampire Academy book yet, and I was pleased with that fact initially. I've been wanting \\"more\\" and hoped this third volume with come through for me. In some respects it does. I like how Rose finally turns her attention inward and, when pressed, pays some attention to what's going on inside. I'm also glad she's making a few friends other than limpid Lissa and dour Dimitri. Though I never really bought the whole Mason thing, I thoroughly enjoyed watching her interact with Christian, Mia, Adrian, and particularly Eddie. The mutual respect and willingness to work together to protect their assigned Moroi lent a nice maturity to their actions and the calling and burden of the Guardians. I've enjoyed the history of St. Vladimir and his shadow kissed partner Anna from the very beginning and I liked how that played out in this more modern story as well. However, I have to say it was mostly a slog getting through SHADOW KISS. Those interesting bits were overshadowed by so much telling, so little showing, and a healthy dose of predictability. These drawbacks kept me from fully engaging. I kept wishing book two had been the longer one and that there were more scenes with Adrian in them. I saw the end coming a mile away and, as it mirrors a certain event in a certain TV series I followed religiously, I threw back my head and groaned when the fateful moment finally came. I was so not okay with it. So. I know this was everyone's favorite, but for me that spot is still held by book two. Will I be picking up the fourth book? Yes. Why? Because I am an Adrian junkie. And, yeah, I want to find out what happens to Rose. You'll be hearing from me soon.espects it does.

THE COOL THING IS THAT AT LEAST THIS ONE HAS A DVD THAT IS OKAY AND SHOWS MOSTLY OLD FOOTAGE OF SLIPKNOT AND LIVE CONCERTS, BUT IS GOOD. IT ALSO SHOWS ALL OF SLIPKNOTS OLD MUSIC VIDEOS LIKE:SURFACING,WAIT AND BLEED(LIVE AND ANIMATED),AND SPIT IT OUT. ALSO SHOWS A FULL LIVE CONCERT FEATURING:SURFACING,(SIC),WAIT AND BLEED,PROSTHETICS,PURITY,AND MANY MORE. THE CD DOES HAVE SOME REMIXS AND DOES FEATURE THE DEMOS SNAP AND WAIT AND BLEED. UNLIKE THE OTHER SLIPKNOT SELF TITLED ALBUMS IT HAS VERY DIFFERANT ART WORK IN THE BOOK ABS THE LYRICS OUR KIND OF MORE ORGINIZED OUT, IF YOU WANT TO READ THEM. IF YOU DONT OWN ANY OF THE OTHER SELF TITLED SLIPKNOT ALBUMS OR A BIG FAN LIKE ME THIS IS A GOOD DEAL. THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVEIW OF SLIPKNOT 10TH ANNIVERSARY CD/DVD.

0545123267|2.0|I actually got this book from my little sister's book order because I saw the great reviews of it.  At the end, I was disappointed, though.     So basically the premise is the classic star-crossed lovers thing.  A human girl falls in love with the wolf that saved her from his own kind, and then finds out that he's a werewolf.  He is only a human in the summer, and stays human for less time each year until he never changes again.  This is his last year.     This book left so much unexplained.  For example, Sam's love of music and lyrics.  I think the author assumed that the reader would understand what that was about, but for something that was a part of the story, the idea seemed unfinished.      Another part of this book that didn't satisfy me was the lack of build to the story.  If the author had gone a tiny bit further into the climax, it would have been more interesting.  The ending gave me a .... moment, and I had to go back and read it again.    I would not recommend this book to someone looking for a good story.  For me (someone who reads A LOT), this book was just \\"eh.\\"

031606792X|1.0|This is by far the worst book in the series. Not only is the writing bad and uninteresting, but the plot is almost non-existent. Bella and Edward have almost no personality in Breaking Dawn. What the heck happened to my noble Jacob in this book!?! Too many new vampires are introduced in the story and frankly, I didn't care about any of them! And, why wasn't the encounter with the Volturi more suspenseful? I could go on and on, but many of the other reviewers have already stated the details much better than I can. Just believe me when I say this book is a disappointment.
B00064AM6C|5.0|I absolutely love this dvd.  Raunchy, crunching guitar riffs; ear-splitting guitar solos; Jack's blazing, tortured vocals; and Meg's driving beat make for a live show that will lock you in a trance.  I love the way it was shot as well; especially with all of the over-produced junk that is out there.  Its refreshing to see and hear a band that has such raw talent and such a passion for what they are doing.  The White Stripes are, without a doubt, one of greatest modern rock bands out there. And I really don't care what people say about meg, because she's brilliant.  Her style is all part of the fun and you can tell shes having a blast. (Simplicity is what makes them so painfully good.)  Being as they don't have a set list, its impressive how she so effortlessly keeps up with Jack.  The physical quality of the actual dvd is perfect.  If it were given to me as a gift, I would have never known that it was used. Not a single, tiny scratch on it.  Rarely have I been so satisfied with a purchase and I know for a fact that I will watch this over and over again (I already have).

I think what would help most people would be to invest in a pair of the plastic glasses rather than the cardboard ones and you will have an entirely different experience with this 3D movie and others as well.

B000VECAEO|3.0|This is the least enjoyable season. I thought it as unnecessary. An I thought the ending was overly contrived even if their comeuppance was long overdue. In an interview Jerry says that the show was still top rated. Many of us watch TV shows past their prime because of habit. Or we're curious to find out how it ends. Not because the show is still good and/or relevant. The British know not to overextend their welcome!
B002KH4KSY|3.0|First, I'm not necessarily convinced that Children of the Corn needed to be remade. The original wasn't half bad, and the 80's capabilities proved a good match to the nuances of the story.  This remake, also, isn't half bad.  Its a pretty faithful retelling of the famous story, done in what feels more higher budget and better production with obviously newer technologies.  The acting is decent, and the camera work is as well.  If you're a huge fan of the original, you might enjoy this.
1591841984|5.0|I've read a good three or four books on Steve Jobs so far, and this has been one of my favourites.  Not only does Leander Kahney make seemingly accurate and educated assumptions at all aspects of Jobs' thinking, but he backs it up with examples from former Apple employees and quotes from El Jobso himself.  While other books, such as biographies, on Steve Jobs tend to stay on the cusp of his decision making process, among other things, Leander has a brilliant and entertaining way of getting past all that and digging deep to expose what's really going on inside Steve's brain.     This book has definitely given me some knowledge on Steve Jobs, and Apple all-around (especially Jonathan Ive) that I had not yet known, and so yes, this is worth your money.  Great read.

B0000CDJPQ|5.0|I recently purchased an iMac and discovered that it only had a Firewire 800 port. Needing to import some video, I searched Amazon and came across this adapter. First, the adapter is much cheaper than the corded adaptors. Second, when the adaptor arrived, I plugged it in, and video transfer began. It was as if the adaptor wasn't there, which is the point. It worked flawlessly.
0747572593|4.0|The English Patient is by far one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The words are so generous and descriptive, each page was an adventure into the lives of the characters, and every work delicious. I have not read any other books by Michael Ondaatje, but I will certainly be looking for others.  I would recommend this book to anybody who can appreciate good literature, not to the lover of the Mills and Boon type book.
0307277453|5.0|I'm a geology major in my second year of college, and we were assigned to read this book for our Paleontology class. I dreaded it at first, but upon opening Shubin's book, I was fascinated. I found the book to be very well organized, with each chapter introducing a new idea. Shubin, while staying true to science and facts, discusses how we are all distantly, not directly, related to a common ancestor. It is overwhelming to think of our similarities with other creatures.    Shubin describes how certain genes, such as the Sonic Hedgehog (which controls placement of certain body structures) and Pax 6 (which is the master creator of the eyes), can be transferred from organism to organism and still serve the same purpose. He discusses the bone structure of organisms, and shows that all creatures with any form of a limb has the same one-bone-two-bone-lotsa blobs-digits arrangement. He further goes on to explain in a later chapter that \\"the same gill arch that formed part of the jaw of a reptile formed ear bones in mammals (Shubin p.160).\\"     Shubin, in my opinion did a wonderful job of explaining and educating about evolution, without all of the defensiveness and justification that some evolutionist authors tend to have. He did not try to disprove any other theories, only gave count after count of evidence for his own. After reading Your Inner Fish, I think it would be difficult not to be persuaded that we are related to seemingly different creatures such as the shark and worm.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I'd prefer to give this a 4.5 out of 5.  The story was good, the characters were good, and the weapons were mind-blowing.  I gave it a 5 for the effects, the action, and the incredible fight sequences.  But the aliens were a little too cutesy; a little not-quite-believable.  Fix that minor flaw, and this would have been cinematic perfection.  As it is, you'll stop caring about everything else once they start firing those guns.  Awesome.

B002HWRYJE|3.0|I have never seen such a tempest in a teapot as there is about this movie.Almost every single review, regardless of whether they love it or hate it, has multiple negative votes. The trekies are out in full force, arguing like the universe or at least the planet earth depended on this piture. It's really funny.    The picture was fun. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad, it was just fun. Some of y'all think it was \\"the best movie ever made\\", and each review to that effect gets multiple \\"no\\" votes.  Others think it's \\"the worst trash ever produced\\" and they also get multiple \\"no\\" votes. Can't seem to please nobody. Lighten up people. This is not Citizen Kane, Macbeth, Death of a Salesman or even No Country For Old Men. It's a sci-fi action movie based on a cheesy 1960's TV show and it isn't high art by any definition. I liked it but I wouldn't have been any more or less happy if I hadn't or if it had not even been made. Why can't you argue about something that really matters.    It's not important enough to merit either one star or five stars. It's not really worth the time it took me to write this. But I had to comment on how silly all the arguments are. It great, it's terrible, it's great, yada yada. IT'S A MOVIE. Grow up!

0823004325|5.0|This book is like no other book I have found on the market today. It has such great personality to it, as well as such great teaching models that an aspiriing artist who seeks to do portraits, comics, or paintings with people with facial expressions, this is the book for you! Not only is there page after page of practical instruction, there are also sections within this book that discuss how to draw eyes that show emotions, how the mouth responds with expression, and for this I have to say I have never found this much in depth teaching all within one book. I would say this would be a must have for an artists reference library.

0071636080|5.0|Throughout the year, I am engaged in a number of speaking gigs. This book came along at a most interesting time for me personally. I've run my own companies and used a number of techniques to get a message across.<br /><br />Jobs is clearly one of the most captivating speakers of our day. He has been able to attract an almost cult-like following based on his public speaking abilities. Other executives at Apple have made attempts, but few can compare to Steve.<br /><br />I recommend the book, just like I do Toastmasters or Dale Carnegie courses, because I think everyone in business should be able to speak well in front of audiences. It is one way that a leader can gain leverage.<br /><br />The book covers why he is a great speaker and gives a ton of tips to help any reader to also become a great speaker. It covers things like the 10 minute rule (people drift after 10 minutes so you need either a break or major shift).<br /><br />One interesting comment. \\"People have forgotten how to listen and take notes instead\\". Then it goes on to explain how bad PowerPoint multi bullet slides are. Slides attract note taking. I, on the other hand, think note taking can increase retention.<br /><br />Delivering supplemental information such as handouts, outlines, etc. with a presentation can help boost overall retention levels. Giving a website for both additional information or a rehash of the information given during presentation can boost  effectiveness. Rather than go into the technical details on each product Apple releases during a keynote speech, Jobs often utilizes this tactic to both drive traffic to the website and commit them to buy through their online store.<br /><br />In any speech - answer the one big question. At most have 3 main points - often supporting the one big question.  The book talks about passion. Clearly Jobs is the king of this. Passion sells and passion makes for great speeches.<br /><br />Simplicity is key. According to Jobs, \\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\\"<br /><br />The book does not speak about how the credibility of the speaker greatly enhances the receptivity of the audience. One reason Jobs can captivate an audience is a because of what he has accomplished - people listen. His ability to create demand for a products the public never thought they needed to begin with is uncanny.<br /><br />The true value of this book is in getting people to shift their mindset. Boring, lengthy, somewhat unproductive presentations are becoming the norm. Presenters can be much more effective by shifting their approach and being mindful of concepts mentioned in this book. I strongly suggest anyone with public speaking aspirations to give this book a chance.e credibility of the speaker greatly enhances the receptivity of the audience.

1881273989|5.0|You got to use it.  Knowing your partner's love language is not enough. Your partner knowing your love language is not enough. You got to really use it.     This information is the basics of relationship repair. There are only about five categories. You don't need to read the entire book or listen to the entire CD to identify the love languages. They are in the table of contents with your languages visually plain. The hard part is to apply what you learn. This book doesn't go into that enough. But knowing it is required of your next steps. When your relationship is hurt and each of you are selfish then applying what you will know from the Love Languages is beyound the scope of this book. But it is a simple start. Once you deal with your wounds and give your partner exactly what they want in love then you have a fraction of a chance of turning the corner. Ofcoarse I recommend giving this to your partner and discussing it together so the knowledge is not one way and probablably the giving wont go one way in this set up.   Your next book after doing this should be \\"Getting the Love you Want.\\" The application obstacles will be revealed here. Best wishes to the reader.

This is definitely in my rotation to watch again. Lots of crazy action throughout the movie. Blue Ray IS the way to watch this one :D

1400063736|3.0|As others have noted, this is an overlapping set of stories given some unity by a tightrope walk in New York City. The actual heart of the book is a set of stories that involve an Irish monk living in the projects in the Bronx. Involved with him are his brother (newly arrived from Ireland), a mother-daughter team of streetwalkers, a woman who becomes the love of his life, and assorted pimps, sex workers, and clients at a nursing home. Other characters include members of a support group for parents of Vietnam War casualties, a judge, and the tightrope walker. People old enough to have some memory of 1974 will recognize many pop culture cliches in the book: the well-intentioned liberal judge worn down by bureaucracy and criminal recidivism, a prostitution culture that owes a little too much to Blaxploitation films, and the kind of unconventional true believer clergy who briefly flourished in the Vatican II era. The monk is the most fully drawn character in the book, with failings and heart. The other characters tend toward the one-dimensional. In some places, McCann seems to race through character development as in the case with woman who adopts the children of the younger streetwalker. The interior lives of the characters are largely told to us rather than naturally unfolding. This kind of thing works well enough in a short story, but seems rather didactic and unconvincing in a novel. McCann seems to have researched many details like the location of Cleveland's 1970s downtown prostitution stroll, but his portraits of Park Avenue and the South Bronx seem like movie set pieces rather than real places. The opening chapter (which set-up the tightrope walk) and the overlapping narratives seem tailor made for an ensemble independent film and perhaps that medium could give the life to this story that McCann's book lacks. The National Book Award panel seems to reward unusual narrative styles; unfortunately, in this case, they've rewarded a clumsy attempt at novel length short story fiction. Despite its unevenness, I did manage to finish the book, but it wasn't as satisfying as many far less ambitious and gimmick-ridden novels.
0812550706|3.0|Ender's Game is a great sci-fi in many ways. It is a much easier to read than many futuristic pieces and the settings are vivid although somewhat left to the imagination (am I just saying I have a good imagination)<br /><br />The novel follows Ender as he completes military training to defeat 'The Buggers'. In order to succeed Ender must survive his murderous brother, fellow students, the games that his superiors play, and eventually the enemy themselves.<br /><br />My problem with the book is that its main drawcard is the ending twist. The rest of the book lacks real tension. The main character is a child prodigy who never looses a battle, so one reads the book without any fear of the protaganist failing or the need for a resolution of tension.<br /><br />The character development is relatively basic, although there are a few satisfying revalations. There are also the occasional interesting philosophies on warfare throughout Ender's lessons.<br /><br />Ultimately Ender's Game is an excellent beginning to a series and a relatively easy read. Recommended to sci-fi fans and those who enjoy straightforward books.

0689865384|4.0|There's not much left to say about this book. It has plenty of great characters and is a real page-turner, and I look forward to reading the rest of the series. The best aspect of this story, though, is the haunting truth underneath underneath all the prettiness and technology of its future world. It really makes you question what humanity has become, but at the same time wonder if a \\"perfect\\" world would really be so perfect after all. I recommend this book for anyone and everyone, and I strongly advise that you take a look at its underlying themes. Uglies won't disappoint.

0786838655|4.0|Perhaps I'm a bit biased about this book, considering I'm a sucker for Greek mythology. The modernization of the Greek gods was masterful, and I found myself enjoying the humorous allusions tremendously. The plot was also excellent, with an unexpected twist in the end that leaves us on the edge of our seat for the sequel. Percy himself comes off as quite funny; he's a normal, likable character that everyone can relate to. You can feel the sparks fly between him and Annabeth, and I look forward to seeing how that relationship pans out. All in all, this is a novel definitely worth your time.

B001AVCFJM|1.0|I thought if I bought the movie on dvd and watched it a couple more times, my opinion of it would improve.  Unfortunately that was not the case, and now I dislike it even more.  All it does is make a mockery of the classic series; poor characterizations and casting (Kirk is now a wuss, Spock has no logic, Uhura the whore, Scotty is nothing more than comic relief, etc), villain without a cause (seriously, the Borg Queen and Ru'afo had more of a drive and purpose than this Nero guy), storyline inconsistencies abound (backstory doesn't cohere to the movie, nor does the in-movie explanations of events), and those darn lens flares in the eyes the whole time, just to name a SMALL few...  Basically, it didn't capture the heart of Star Trek AT ALL (even the remake \\"Lost In Space\\" movie was able to achieve its goal of remaining true to the original, but giving it an updated look).  This movie is just another example of Hollywood's inability to come up with any new ideas and is, like most other remake movies of classic shows and films these days, a mockery of whatever it's supposed to be based on, repackaged for our new brainless generation of moviegoers by slapping a bunch of sex, swearing, explosions, advertising gimmicks and liberal use of original catch phrases (to try and make it sound genuine), and giving them a shiny new apple store packaging to \\"re-imagine\\" something that was never dysfunctional in the first place.  Needless to say, I'll be selling it on eBay tomorrow.

B001FB55HQ|4.0|It should really have ended with TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, with the horrific post-apocalyptic future finally averted and that credo &#34;No fate but what we make&#34; resounding triumphantly in our ears. At least James Cameron knew better than to muddy up the waters, knew better than to mess up the perfect ending. In Hollywood, though, it's all about milking that cow dry, and the Terminator franchise was too lucrative to leave alone. Hell, the Governator couldn't turn down a third installment. Except without Cameron helming it and with Nick Stahl's negligible turn as John Connor (and with Arnie no longer looking so spry), TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES came up blah. And they still, still, still wouldn't let it rest.<br /><br />TERMINATOR: SALVATION feels like, looks like, smells like a lead-in to yet further sequels. Setting down the haterade cup for a sec, I admit it's a technically well-executed film. It brims with dazzling special effects. It soaks in gritty, ominous atmosphere. It's the story itself that is found wanting. A story with this post-apocalyptic premise, in which the human race is on the verge of obliteration, it should make you want to root for humanity's survival. But, thanks to some weak characterization, I find myself not really giving a toss for anyone except for Sam Worthington's character.<br /><br />If the trailer hadn't already given it away, then the opening sequence, set in 2003, spoilers it but big as death row inmate Marcus Wright (Worthington) signs a contract to have Cyberdyne have its way with his corpse. He does this in exchange for a kiss from Helena Bonham Carter, which would've been a cute moment except that it went by too abruptly. Cut then to the year 2018, and Judgment Day has happened. Everywhere lie the decay and ruins of civilization. The Machines have taken over. This isn't yet the time of John Connor. At this stage he is regarded by what's left of the human resistance as either savior or false prophet. At this stage John Connor is a respected and influential soldier in the Resistance, but, as the movie starts, he comes off as more or less still just one of the guys, just one of the soldiers, even if his peers know all about his perceived destiny. In 2018, John Connor ranks only second on Skynet's hit list.<br /><br />The person Skynet would most like to neutralize is a teenager named Kyle Reese, and even the casual fan is well aware that the Terminator mythos is very dependent on Kyle Reese. However, I don't get the logic in Reese being more crucial for Skynet to stop than John Connor. Connor doesn't know where Kyle is, but we learn that Kyle and a mute little girl comprise the entire Los Angeles-based resistance. Who knows how much longer these two could've waged their losing battle against Skynet's war machines, except that it's around here that Marcus Wright inexplicably resurfaces, asking what day and year it is and seemingly stunned at the rampant devastation stretching to the horizon. Marcus Wright's last memory is being executed in 2003 and his presence now in 2018 has already altered the time line. Elsewhere, John Connor tells his wife: &#34;Something has changed. This is not the future my mother told me about.&#34; The only question is whether Marcus is someone from the past or something deployed from the future by Skynet. Either way, Marcus promptly proves to have exceptional survival skills.<br /><br />I liked this movie, liked enough about it that I don't really feel like slamming it too hard. The first two Terminator movies and even the SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES have built up enough good will that, even though I was a bit iffy about this fourth entry, I knew I was gonna be in the theater when it opened up. The story itself isn't all that and feels disjointed in spots. The core narrative follows Marcus Wright, but a key sub-plot involves the Resistance's discovery of a device which emits an override signal and renders the Machines inert. This kill switch is crucial tothe Resistance's plan to take the fight directly to Skynet. This is pretty ho-hum stuff to me, and doesn't at all give me what I crave for, which is a series of absorbing character moments involving folks other than Marcus (Marcus has plenty of character moments).<br /><br />Thankfully, the incredibly intense action sequences and the special effects carry the movie, with the CG being wicked spectacular. And I dig the colossal Transforminator! Director McG and his crew really sell the harrowing, dirty, grainy future world and establish that palpable sense of bleakness, that sense that man has lost his place as the dominant species on the planet. Sam Worthington plays sympathetically, and never mind that his Australian accent peeks out every now and then. The film's emotional core absolutely revolves around Marcus Wright. You certainly connect with him more than with the grim and tortured John Connor, and going by the quality of Worthington's performance, AVATAR has got itself a crackling good lead. Anton Yelchin as the teenaged Kyle Reese does a good job of channeling Michael Bienh's mannerisms. And to ***SPOILER*** the rest of this sentence, there's a serious fanboy moment when a certain T-800 makes an appearance.<br /><br />When that military defense program known as Skynet achieved self-awareness, who would've thunk it that several of its cyborgs (including the T-800 from T2) would demonstrate more charisma and soulfulness than would the robotic Christian Bale as John Connor? And someone please tell the guy he's not on the Batman set anymore?<br /><br />TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES taps Kate Brewster as a key figure in the Resistance, except that, here, she does a lot of standing around, and it doesn't help that it's the lifeless Bryce Dallas Howard taking over that role (not that Claire Danes was any great shakes). Moon Bloodgood is sexy but superfluous, and, speaking as a dude, it's irksome that her nude scene was deleted. Absolutely, there's a jarring cut right around before the bandits attack Bloodgood's character, making it very apparent that a huge chunk of scene had been lopped off. The sense is that Bloodgood was supposed to provide a further emotional connection, and possibly even a romantic one, with Marcus. But all that is cut out. The Boy & His Robot theme is offered up again - between Kyle and Marcus, and between the little mute girl and Marcus - but it's not so convincing. And I resent the movie trying to manipulate us even more by introducing the &#34;Newt&#34; element.<br /><br />That old no-nonsense pro Michael Ironside, whom I remember best from the original V mini-series, comes in to provide some much needed fire in the belly as the current Resistance leader. So that's good.<br /><br />For someone touted as the savior of humanity, John Connor doesn't really do much until near the end, and so there's a credibility issue here. In the prior films, John Connor was either this shadowy figure lurking in the future or he was portrayed by unremarkable yahoos like Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl and that kid from the TV series. Meaning that, here we are somewhat caught up with the future time line and this is when and where John Connor is supposed to make his mark. He doesn't, and if Christian Bale hadn't insisted on expanding his John Connor role, word has it that the future messiah would've been relegated more to the background, maybe only as a raspy voice broadcasting over the radio, offering hope to the isolated pockets of survivors: &#34;This is John Connor. If you are listening to this - you are the Resistance.&#34;<br /><br />And one beef I've always had - but it's minor - is the Terminators' habit of throwing their targets around, instead of just efficiently snapping necks. And - okay, I'm ***SPOILERING*** this sentence - - - when Connor infiltrates the heart of Skynet, he encounters only two Terminators. Two! So, okay, one is supposed to be the very first T-800 model; I guess that's why there's only one of his type. And the second is a T-600. Only, this is the heart of Skynet! Where's the rest of its soldiers?<br /><br />I miss Sarah Connor, her presence here relegated to voice recordings frequently consulted by John. But that's how good Linda Hamilton was.<br /><br />SALVATION presents us with a passel of Hunter-Killer war machines (the T-600, T-800, the hydrobot, the self-automated motorbikes, the Infiltration Prototype, etc.) but, probably because this is a PG-13 flick, the threat level isn't as impressive and these metal suckers aren't as frightening. And if you're expecting SALVATION to resolve everything, to provide a capper to the franchise, that doesn't happen. If anything, the hokey ending sets up a new trilogy. And as much as I've been grousing for the past few paragraphs, I'll say again that I like this movie. SALVATION is a gritty war movie as much as it is a sci-fi thriller. It certainly bears repeated viewings for the many very cool fan moments provided, although, okay, a young Kyle Reese doesn't quite pull off the iconic &#34;Come with me if you want to live&#34; line.<br /><br />In 2029, John Connor sends Kyle to 1984 to save Sarah Connor. This story being set in 2018, that's over a decade of stuff to chronicle. Yeah, man, this is gonna be another trilogy; it may even end up being a good one. John Connor still has a chance to convince us as that he IS one righteous mutha and that he's fated to lead humanity. But I can't help but agree with Linda Hamilton; this thing should've ended with the first two films, with &#34;No fate but what we make&#34; still the relevant rallying cry.

0691142165|4.0|\\"This time is different\\" was purchased after one of the authors appeared on Charlie Rose. It is formidable, with lots of pages and graphs, but well organized with advance notice about topics. It can also be read in segments, e.g.one segment deal entirely with this country's 2008 collapse. It is written in language that can be understood by the unsophisticated. The service from the shipper was right on schedule. Readers will have to take time to understand a topic of great significance. i.e. the failure of national leaders to learn from centuries of financial folly
0312370849|5.0|The writing style, the content and the development of the characters hit home, as I had studied in France and had a quite clear-cut impression of the French people that was capured accurately in this book.

Unearthing such a buried subject took guts for a French author and for this I commend her and suggest this novel to all my friends who experienced our junior year together in France.

0810994739|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid Rodrick rules<br />  Diary of a Wimpy Kid is one of my favorite series. I can't wait to see the movie that is coming out in April .It's a funny book ,like this part in the book when his dad makes him go to swimming practice when Greg doesn't want to go. When they start racing his dad  tells him some stuff but not everything he left out one important detail here is what he didn't tell him \\"But what he DIDN'T tell me was that the starter gun only fired BLANKS. So I was a whole lot worried where the bullet was gonna land than I was about getting myself to the other end of the pool.\\" I wish I could show you the picture because instead of diving he did a cannon ball in to the pool because he didn't want to get hit by the bullet when there wasn't one. There's also this other part in  the story when they are playing a game with a nerd that is there babysitter .It is like a homemade game but when their mom finds out she changes the whole game  .Intead of evil people she puts in nice people ,so the game was just not a fun game because Greg's mom was just not a person to play with in a magick and monsters game .O and his friend Rowley has a birthday party and he has at a childish place .They were opening presents and Greg was suprised because Rowly got a diary just like Greg .I don't think Greg injoyed that party at all .Greg's mom makes a gingerbread house a week before Christmas and she put it on top of the refrigerator so no one will get any of it ,but that doesn't stop Greg so every night he sneaks downstaries and takes a bite of it but not alot he doesn't want to get caught .But on Christmas day when she showseveryone the gingerbread house is all chewd up and everyone is surprised because ,Greg didnt eat that much of it but he never got caught .There is this other  part in this book when Rodrick and Greg have a deal with their mom and they have to earn mom bucks to get real money .But when Greg is at house he figures out the mom bucks are from board games. Rowley has the board game and Greg takes all of them and goes home and hides it under his bed .Then he needs to do a book reveiw but he doesnt do it so Rodrick has a old book reveiw and he gives it to him for mom bucks ,Greg just gave him a hand full .Then when he gets to school he notices it already had a grade and that grade was an F. So Greg wasn't very happy, because when he got home Rodrick tried to cash in the handfull he gave him and Greg got caught, cause Rodrick didn't use his brain and just cash some in once in a while. So Greg got caught and grounded. Then their can't go out on vacation and Greg and Rodrick have to stay at grampas and that's the worst place to stay at. His grampa serves some really sloppy dinner and it's just gross from the picture. Well it was their fault cause Rodrick threw a party and some person took a picture with their moms camra and Rodrick was in the picture .Ok back to grampas he gives them the slop and its made \\"It's basically a bunch of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in a pool of vineger. \\" Doesn't that just sound digusting .Well that was my book reveiw on Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules.es.

0439023491|5.0|I'm still in shock about this book. Seriously, one of the best books I've ever read. She has this amazing way to end each chapter so socking that you are literally unable to put it down. I mean, as a big reader I already have practice in the dreadful art of putting down books that are consuming, but this was something else entirely. After the first few chapters my body reacted on its own: when I saw the chapter was about to end, my heart would start racing for no reason yet. So this is my recommendation for the few who haven't read this yet, when you're planning to stop reading soon, close it in the middle of the chapter it's the only way you will manage to stop.<br /><br />The plot was excellent, the character beyond excellent and the writing was... excellent! I have no complains at all except the fact that, why would she end it like that? Why would she leave her faithful readers so so so desperate? I need the third book right now! (Rumored title is The Victors) This is my Absolute favorite series now, and I recommend it to everyone! - NOTE: It contains a lot of violence.
B001FB55I0|2.0|I had such high expectations for this film, until I started reading about the director, and my trepidation started to set-in. However, the trailers looked great, so I hoped he actually was onto something. Then literally 5 minutes into the film, when John Connor crawled out of wherever he was and everything was gone for some reason not known, I knew that my worse fears came true.  The plot was very weak and completely disjointed and at time undecipherable. Christian Bale who I really like slept-walked through this role, and his whispering of his lines was extremely annoying.  Why they entrusted this franchise to a music video director with a wannabe rapper/DJ name(What is up with the name McG??? Are you serious?),I have no idea. He screwed this up as badly as the Fantastic Four director (and they let him at it twice, oh no!)

B002BSHXJA|5.0|COME ON EVERYBODY, LET'S GET OUR CLAWS EXTENDED AND REALLY GET VISCOUS IN DEFENSE OF OUR MONO VERSIONS OF THE BOX SET!!!        This is probably going to sound elitist and will certainly cheese many of you off.  Tough.  If the topic is the Beatles, there can neither be value freeness nor neutrality. When the remastered stereo box came out it was so difficult to find that a major book retailer put together a \\"collection\\" with each cd and sold them at a heavily discounted price.  Good deal, good deed, and hats off to them.  I sat in front of the speakers for hours.  They sounded crisp and sharp. But, too often, the sound seperation bordered on the awkward and forced on some songs.  While buyers were frantically looking for the stereo box, rumours abounded that it would not be available until after christmas.  I actually felt sorry for those fans with real responsibilities running around looking for the stereo box or spending ridiculous prices to independent web retailers who were asking upwards of $500.00 a pop.  While all this was going on, I noticed that one cd retailer had a copy of the mono box that sat and sat and sat.  I finally broke down and bought it, not really expecting much as far as sonic clarity.  Jeez, was I mistaken.  In our age teeny tiny surround sound squeakers and a \\"stick it under a table so it's out of the way\\" boomers; of remastered/remixed CD's, a bonus track or ten and expanded yet shrinking liner notes, etc., etc., we have often lost sight of the world of mono and the richness and quality of mono recording.  Think \\"Pet Sounds.\\" The sonic quality of the mono, remastered versions included in the Beatles new box set will get heads a spinning.  Very simply, they're INCREDIBLE!!!  So run down to your favorite CD store and buy it yesterday.  When you get back home, take a pair of medium to large speakers, set treble, mid, and bass to neutral.  Now get on the floor, place head between speakers, and float downstream. No one but the Beatles themselves, George Martin and a few sound engineers heard what we are finally getting to hear today, mono in sonic splendor 40+ years down the road.  Still rocking the joint, shaking the hair, and sniffin' the tears with ballads.  Much given.  Much taken.  We loved them. They loved us back. So give those early 90's CD's a toss in the rubbish bin or play them in your car.  Use the stereo box as a door stopper.  And listen, simply listen, to  what the Beatles heard when they wrapped up their sessions and presented their gifts to the world.  Ciao baby!  Berry Sexmas and Happy Crimble.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|My wife had wanted to watch this movie for a while, but I had my reservations about Liam Neeson as an action hero.  Let me just say that I was extremely surprised by this movie (in a good way).  Liam Neeson was an absolute bad@$$ and I loved every minute of it.  He gives a great performance in this movie and it seems like this role was tailor made for him.  His cool, calm demeanor really fit the character.  If I was a bad guy and I heard the speech he gave to the kidnapper on the phone, I'd be crapping my pants LOL<br /><br />This movie takes us back to old school action that isn't 90% CGI like it is nowadays.  Once the action starts, it seems like it just doesn't stop until the very end.  I don't want to ruin anything, so I'll just say anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet should at least give it a try.  And for action movie junkies, this should be a must-watch.  TAKEN is definitely one of my favorite movies in recent memory.

Just because a movie is \\"cultural\\" and it has a song in it does not necessarily make it good.    I actually decided to go to the slums of Mumbai to see if this movie is actually realistic (wanted to volunteer). The people living in the slums of Mumbai are completely different from what is shown in the movie. I noticed that people had color TVs in their homes, stereo systems, running water, etc. And they were all happy to be living there as a community.    This movie was too fake to be appreciated. Some scenes are totally disturbing and unnecessary (and unreal).

0439023491|5.0|I was very surprised by The Hunger Games when I read it a year ago and it became one of my favorite books I read in the past few years.  Catching Fire, the second in the trilogy, was a very fun quick read.  Being that it is the middle book it does fall into that realm that  a lot of middle books do of a mop up of some plot points from the first and a bridge to the finally but I sill enjoyed it very much.  We are given a little bit more insight into the other 11 districts and this book forcuses on the impending rebellion that the main character Katniss has unknowingly become the symbol of.  I am such a fan of the word Suzanne Collins has created that my only complaint about the book is that I wish it was longer.  There are several sections of the book that we only get descriptions of what happened but don't actually get to \\"follow\\" the character for those events.  I wish instead of summarizing what had happened, the author would have let us follow the character there.  The story in this book takes place over the year between the Hunger Games in the first book and the Hunger Games scheduled the year after so I understand that would of been a lot to cover.  This is a great book in an incredible series.  I highly recommend.

1416594787|5.0|About 20 years ago I started reading Stephen Jay Gould's essay collections.  Then I discovered the work of Carl Zimmer and Neil Shubin and other evolutionary biologists.  When this book came out I didn't intend to buy it as I have so many books on evolution and keep up with biology news.  I went ahead and ordered it thinking that if there was nothing new in it I could always give it to a friend.    What a surprise!  This book is a great overview of the subject - including very recent fossil discoveries in China as well as the standard subjects - radioactive dating, fossils, DNA evidence, etc.  Somewhere along the way I had forgotten how the radioactive dating clock starts and Dawkins gives a very lucid explanation that will stay with me now.  He also references other good books such as Shubin's \\"Your Inner Fish\\" and Coyne's \\"Why Evolution is True.\\"      If you aren't teaching biology or natural history, this is a good refresher that will doubtless have some new info that you will find intriguing.  If you don't know much about evolution and natural selection this book is the best one out there for an overview.    I'll be keeping this book.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I had never listened to the Beatles in mono before, and never would have considered buying a mono version thinking it would be inferior to the stereo version.  However, since owning an iPod and listing to the Beatles with headphones, I found the stereo versions to be somewhat annoying.  The drums and bass were often on one side of my head, while the voices and guitars were on the other.  It was kind of unpleasant to listen to, and distracting.  I guess they hadn't quite figured out how to do a proper stereo mix in the early days of Hi-Fi.  I also found out that the Beatles themselves focused their attention on recording the mono tracks since that is what the majority of their listeners.  So listening to mono with headphones has been such a thrill and a relief!  It sounds great, and there are subtle differences between the mono and stereo versions that surprise me.  Especially with Sgt Pepper. Its been great to experience this music as it was intended.   I wish they would remix the stereo tracks so they were balanced properly.  I'm sure at some point they'll do that to bring even more money in.  I'd buy it in a second.
0316069906|5.0|Jonathan Safran Foer is a novelist, not a journalist. He is often lauded (or derided) for his inventive verbal pyrotechnics, but there is nothing coy or cute about the title of this book. Becoming a father inspires him to explore his nascent vegetarianism, and he feels a parent's responsibility to validate his or her eating habits in order to determine what is best for his or her child. With this in mind, he embarks on an enormous amount of research. EATING ANIMALS is not a novel, but if you are an open-minded carnivore, you may wish that some of what you learn was fictional.    Foer acknowledges that eating animals is a \\"slippery, frustrating, and resonant subject\\" that often provokes \\"defensiveness or aggression.\\" It forces us to ask huge philosophical questions involving the nature of suffering and our own human identity. Are we animals? Foer begins by pointing out the obvious: dogs are animals, and in our culture we don't eat them. Why? Other cultures do and have. We wouldn't even have to eat pets. \\"Three to four million dogs and cats are euthanized annually. This amounts to millions of pounds of meat now being thrown away every year.\\" So why don't we simply eat those animals rather than expend energy and money to have those bodies rendered and fed to livestock, which we then eat?    In ways such as this, the book forces us to confront our own beliefs about what we choose to eat and why. It's an uncomfortable ride, but saved from polemic by the inclusion of some opposing viewpoints. In a section called \\"Hiding/Seeking,\\" a retired farmer says, \\"Sure, you could say that people should just eat less meat, but I've got news for you: people don't want to eat less meat... High-yield farming has allowed everyone to eat.\\"    I'll go out on a limb here and say that I found reading this book strangely like reading a thriller. Foer has woven his material into short, powerful sections, and, true to his literary reputation, he distorts standard forms to make his points. It'snot a funny subject, but his deft language kept it compelling and, at times, humorous. During one secret nocturnal visit to a turkey farm with an animal activist, for example, Foer clutches his copy of the California penal code 597e, which states that it is lawful for any person to supply a confined animal with food and water. \\"I'm imagining some roused-from-REM-sleep-and-well-armed farmer coming upon I-know-the-difference-between-arugula-and-rugelach me scrutinizing the living conditions of his turkeys.\\" 99% of all the meat consumed in the United States is factory-raised. (In the Notes section at the back of the book, he cites the sources for facts such as these, and there is also an extensive index.) Even putting aside the treatment of the animals, the environmental impacts of factory-raised meat are enormous.    \\"Almost always, when I told someone I was writing a book about `eating animals,' they assumed, even without knowing anything about my views, that it was a case for vegetarianism. It's a telling assumption, one that implies not only that a thorough inquiry into animal agriculture would lead one away from eating meat, but that most people already know that to be the case.\\" Yet the book, he insists, is not meant to be \\"a straightforward case for vegetarianism.\\" In addition to illuminating the commonly hidden practices of factory farming, Foer reminds us how intricately what we eat is entwined with the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves.        --- Reviewed by Eileen Zimmerman Nicol

0385504225|1.0|The Lost Symbol, by Dan Brown, is interesting for about the first third of the book, with some word derivations I didn't know and some historical revelations about the Masons. After that, it got progressively less educational, more far-fetched, and downright boring.    I was extremely disappointed by the time I finished it. On the spectrum of books by Dan Brown, I rank Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress as good reads, The Da Vinci Code as weak, and The Lost Symbol as clearly the weakest of his works to date. Unfortunately, it will probably make the highest profit for him, encouraging a further degradation in the quality of his research, story composition and editing.

I challenge you to find another band that can produce a CD with many different musical flavors.    10/10 for resistance - with exogenous symphony III as the best song.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|It is a relief to find HDMI cables that are inexpensive and deliver high quality video. I paid $40 for a 4ft cable at Circuit City a year ago, and less than half that price for the 10ft cable from Amazon.    As an electrical engineer I can tell you copper is copper. Unless Monster cable has coaxial wire for each signal line, which they don't because then the cable would be 10x larger than it is, then it's just copper wire inside a shield. There's still going to be crosstalk and capacitive coupling and all that stuff. All that \\"gas filled\\" stuff doesn't matter either. If you look at the mathematical equasions for the frequency response of an unshielded wire, you'd know none of this stuff makes any major difference.    The biggest thing to avoid, if you can, are ferrite cores on a cable. Ferrite cores are those black blob things that overmold the cable near one or both of the connectors. Ferrite cores act as high frequency filters and may cause signal degradation. They are typically used to comply with FCC laws and other regulatory bodies' radiated emissions laws. They add cost to the cable and typically degrade performance.    Regarding expensive cables, HDMI or otherwise, what no one asks is the most fundamental question - Why? Let's assume Monster cable isn't lying and they can provide 300 GHz bandwidth or whatever they claim. Why do you need a cable that outperforms so much? It's like owning a car that can go 1000 MPH but the speed limit is 55MPH. In my field, that's called \\"over-engineering\\" which equates to unnecessary additional cost, which is exactly the problem Amazon has solved by sourcing this simple low cost HDMI cable.    While I'm soapboxing, gold plating isn't necessary either. Silver is the best conductor, followed by Copper, and then Gold (third best). Stainless Steel isn't far behind. The only reason gold plating is \\"better\\" is Gold does not corrode (but neither does stainless steel... they actually gold plate the stainless steel, how dumb is that?).If you are using your cables in a house where the humidity & temp is relatively constant, you should never need gold. As far as I can tell, Gold is just a gimmick to charge more for cables.

0071636080|5.0|Secrets is an engaging read. There are enough stories of Job's mesmerizing presentations (and the failures of other presenters) to keep the reader interested. Examples and resources help one move from bullet-ridden slides to lean, effective alternatives. Presentations should be dramatic, says Gallo, so he structures the book into acts and scenes to drive home that point.<br /><br />Sprinkled throughout are tidbits of brain research as it applies to designing presentations. Gallo provides eight presentation excerpts that contain side-by-side examples of Job's words and a description of the corresponding slide content. You'll be encouraged to visit websites such as USA Today, Slideshare, Plain English, American Rhetoric, YouTube and others. There are chapter notes and an index.<br /><br />Both Gallo and his advice are believable. The strength of the book probably centers on product marketing presentations. You will have to create your own transition to doing presentations on books, ideas, mental models, etc (certainly doable). Some stories repeat, but the value of the book outweighs the redundancy.<br /><br />If you know very little about Apple, its products and Steve Jobs, you'll get an introduction to that world, to include a little of Steve Job's life philosophy.<br /><br />--Jack Bender, author of Disregarded: Transforming the School and Workplace Through Deep Respect and Courage

If you dont understand where he is coming from stay on your perch, and keep your mouth shut. So on to the review. The book was spot on and hilarious. I worked in kitchens and restaurants in HS and College and my wife thought I was full of crap about what goes on. Im glad someone put what I think down on paper. I am inspired to go cook again, but not that inspired so Ill stay my ass behind this desk. Kitchen work is hard work, more do fail than succeed, and you will cry at least once. I only worked in kitchens about 6 years and I have a missing piece of my left pointer finger kuckle from where I came down to fast with the 10\\" and my left thumb nail has a crease in it from coming down to hard with the pepper cutter my A##hat boss wanted us to use. \\"It makes the little square peppers all the same size.\\" I still cook almost every night but kitchen work is hard work, and I have soft hands. Fact of matter if you are kitchen folk or have been kitchen folk you have met everyone in the book including Bourdain. We all know that cast of characters. We all have seen the debris fall on someones head, we dont eat on Mondays and nuggets scare us all. I cant say enough if you want a good quick read, check this book out.

0439023491|5.0|Last year, The Hunger Games received high ratings from fans all over. Then we spent what seemed like an eternity waiting, anxiously, for the sequel. Finally, it's here-- and believe me, it's just as amazing, if not even a tiny bit more so, than her first novel! Suzanne Collins does a brilliant job at creating a rich, detailed world, while telling a brutally honest story, not one that's sugar coated and perfect.<br />Catching Fire continues the story of Katniss and Peeta, the first dual winners of the deadly Hunger Games. Now that they're 'safely' out of the arena, no longer having to fight for their very life, you'd think they'd be able to live out the rest of their life in peace, right? Wrong!<br /><br />The Capitol realizes that their control over the various districts is slowly being tested, pushed to the limits, and it's all because of Katniss and Peeta's defiance in the arena. As the districts start to rise up against the Capitol, they realize that they need to get rid of the 'spark' that started it all-- Katniss. But how, without alerting the citizens of their plot?<br /><br />Enter the 'surprise' rules for the 75th anniversary Hunger Games! The only names added to the reaping will be the surviving tributes from previous games, one male and one female from each district. Which, naturally, means it's back into the arena for Katniss and Peeta-- and they both know that the Capitol has no plans for allowing them to come back out alive, especially Katniss.<br /><br />I won't go into too many details, I really don't want to ruin the book for fellow fans out there. But I will say that Collin manages to throw new twists and turns into Catching Fire just when you least expect it! And the characters are just as intense and unique as they were before-- along with the relationship between our two favorite winners.<br /><br />The one thing that bothered me is I wish Katniss would wake up and realize that Peeta's the guy for her. As nice as Gale as, there's no fire, no real connection between them in the story. Sure, she speaks fondly of their childhood, but since the beginning of book one, Collins has shown us more of Peeta than Gale, and personally I can't say that I'm upset about it. But that's a whole other story--- and one that we'll just have to wait until the next book to figure out for sure!<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />5/5 STARS! A wonderful, action packed novel that's even better than the first one, Catching Fire has everything in it, from witty characters and dialogue to intense suspense and adventure. And let's not forget the love triangle going on between poor Gale, Katniss, and Peeta! In other words, easily one of the BEST YA series ever! What are you waiting for?

B0026P3G12|5.0|Eclectic? Yes. But this CD is a reflection of Susan's life thus far and aren't all of our life stories a bit eclectic? As I read Susan's personal comments for each song it is clear to me that she indeed has story to tell and she is doing it through her music. As she said; faith, friends, and family remain the most important things to her - these are those things that remained true through the difficult times - this is what she sings about.    The CD reveals a beautiful voice unadulterated by the nervousness of performing at a talent show or impromptu during a television interview. Calm, sweet and sure - Susan is a talented lady.    Looking forward to more.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|I'm a big fan of everything 'Terminator' (own everything on DVD or Blu-Ray) - but this film is a major disappointment.  It has one good action sequence early in the film (though even that steals ideas from Transformers).  The big action sequence at the end is nothing more than Terminator 1's end action scene all over again, right down to the 'Help me, John!' lure by the terminator.  I went in with low expectations, which usually means I can be pleasantly surprised by any redeeming qualities.  There weren't many, in the case of this film.  Sam Worthington plays a character worth watching though.  Christian Bale's character was drab and uninteresting.  (Let's hope he didn't mean it when he said he would be back!)
B0028K3192|4.0|I have always loved Maxwell's work - and 8 years felt like 100, waiting for new material from him.  I saw him perform Pretty Wings on the BET awards; I thought the song was pretty and he looked great.  However, that song alone did not convince me to buy the album.      Then I saw the video for Bad Habits.  Not only did his vocals blow it out of the water, the video was on fire.  Classic Maxwell.  I came right to Amazon.com and ordered the disc.  I have to admit, it took about 3 passes through the songs and me removing any expectations I had for his work for me to really enjoy the product.  The instrumentation and his vocals are exquisite from beginning to end.  He sets the mood for a 70's funk/R&B vibe, and the feeling of the album follows this pattern well.  I have read a couple of other reviews that complained the production was inconsistent.  I give production a B+.    My top picks?  1) Bad Habits  2) Fistful of Tears  3) Playing Possum  4) Cold  5) Love You    I am praying that his follow-up releases have the same fluidity.  I am so pleased with this purchase!

B001FB55I0|3.0|The Terminator franchise is an odd beast.  Since the original 1984 feature, it has been sold to three (soon to be four) different production companies and two different studios.  The only times the plot and dialogue have blended well together were in the first two movies, thanks to the care and writing skill of the younger James Cameron.  Since then, the timeline, plot, and characters of Terminator have gone through mutations and minor changes, either to the delight or disappointment of fans (usually the latter).  For a franchise that doesn't have millions of fans like Star Trek or even Battlestar Galactica, Terminator still has legs.  And Terminator Salvation was a great opportunity to tie some loose ends left over from the last movie and TV series, and reboot the franchise in the hopes of producing a John Connor trilogy.    This film is either the first film of a  second trilogy, or an intermediate movie while the future of the franchise goes up for bid in a Hollywood auction in 2010.  So how is this movie?    First the bad news.  Some of the dialogue, as is the case in too many action films, is poor.  I've always believed movie producers should hire more than script doctors.  They should hire an experienced screenwriter or playwright to give the dialogue a go-over.  The plots are usually okay.  But the words coming out of character's mouths can always use an upgrade.  Again, I look at Aliens as a model in how smart action movie dialog should be written.  At least the dialogue in Terminator Salvation holds together for the first 20 minutes of the 117 minute director's cut.     Slightly less bad news - if the director prefers to be known as 'MCG' (Joseph McGinty Nichol), and whose previous works were the two Charlie's Angels films, you know he's going to spin his wheels and show-off a little bit.  And MCG does.  But he also proves for the first time that he is capable of assembling top-grade action sequences that are both thrilling and comprehensible (unlike Christopher Nolan, who seemed incapable of directing a good action sequence in The Dark Knight, IMO).  MCG seems to have done his homework.  His attention to detail setting-up and executing action sequences is similar to the directors he grew-up with (George Lucas, Brian DePalma, John Woo, James Cameron).  If I were the executive producer, I would have wanted Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men) to direct, or at least a director who didn't give himself a nickname.    And finally, the movie does go off the rails a bit towards the end.  The second half of the movie is poor and cliched.  Christian Bale gets more screen time in the second half, but the final acts test the boundaries of medical and physical plausibility.  Also the second half is weighed-down by b-movie explosions, obvious homages to the first two Terminator movies, and brief tips of the cap to The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Aliens (not so brief with the last movie, as the entire climax seems to replicate Ripley's Rescue).  The first half of the film is clearly better than the second half.  At least the two halves are bridged by a most impressive (and original) chase and battle sequence in which all the great elements of the film come together beautifully.  That sequence is simply crackerjack.    But everything else in the movie I see as good news, in varying amounts.  Masio Kassar remained as executive producer (from T2 and T3) and hired as much Terminator talent as he could - namely the editor and an apprentice of Stan Winston's.  The casting is fine.  The photography, despite being handled by a disliked, unorthodox DP, is excellent, and matches the film's bleak theme and outlook.  The sound design is close to brilliant, with the machines sounding radically different from the previous three movies to awesome effect.  Danny Elfman's restrained score stays off the soundtrack during most action sequences, allowing the jet engines and explosions to speak for themselves.  Art direction and costumes are all first-rate.  Special effects are almost all top-notch, with the exception of a few cheap explosions and some of the aircraft shots.    Some plot weaknesses and poor dialogue aside, this is a wonderfully bleak movie.  Mankind is almost doomed.  The machines are smarter and sometimes more brutal than the previous films.  The machines are not always consistent in their speed (hey they have to take their time to aim at our heroes), but they are always quick to destroy human vehicles before humans, and that is a very welcome bit of smart military strategy on their part.  And some humans are fairly brutal as well.    It's tough for a studio to have a bleak movie as its summer tent pole, but that's what Terminator Salvation was to Warner, which struck box office gold a year earlier with The Dark Knight.  Terminator Salvation failed to crack the # 1 spot in its opening weekend.  But it will be remembered for being the best Terminator feature in 18 years, and that is saying quite a lot.
0385339682|4.0|Its human nature to assume and I assumed this tale by John Grisham was going to be a legal thriller.  There were many scenes in and around a courtroom.

B00005JL78|5.0|I usually don't care for Tom Cruise but for this film he was a beautiful fit. It possesses a sci-fi background about a crime prevention program but it really is a who-dun-it and its theme concerns the abuse of power. Who will watch the watchers? The program predicts Cruise will murder somebody in 36 hours and marks him for arrest and imprisonment. The program is either wrong or the data was manipulated. He evades arrest and begins an investigation into the matter. As a result he learns that the program can interpet the facts differently at times and file minority reports about an alternative to the prediction. These reports are kept secret. The advocates of the program want its approval across the country but another camp is unconvinced. If truth is the proper interpetation of data how can you be sure about the infallibility of the predictions? Or feeding false information into the program for a false prediction? So who would set him up? There are a multitude of people with motive but very few with the means to do so. If it is a colleague at the office then why? At this point it becomes a murder mystery. It was well put together. You could watch the film on numerous occasions and keep it with a core group of films in your collection for the household.

More than satisfying, it was, well freakin amazing!!!!!!! Meyer wraps up the series very nicely, though leaving some things to the immagination such as whether -- or rather, when the Volturi will return. Bella and Edward seem like they were just meant to be, just as in all the books and it is quite satisfying that Jacob and Renesmee (a name which -- to my irritation -- is mispronounced by a lot of people I know. Read the book and you would know that it is pronounced ruh-nez-may) will be together someday in one way or another. It is nice to finally see Jacob fit in somewhere that doesn't involve getting all moody over Bella and Edward's relationship.    Now for the bit of critisism I have for the book and I guess how readers react.    First of all the Edward, Jacob thing. I think if you don't like Edward, well if you despise Edward what are you doing reading this series? Edward was the focus of most of the books and you cannot deny that even in Book Jacob he is still vital. I have heard the \\"real men don't sparkle\\" excuse and well real men don't force engaged women to kiss them. Sorry. It also bothers me how it was Team Edward or Team Jacob. What about the other equally important characters. All of the Cullens, the Romanians, the Denali Coven, the Irish, the Egyptians, the Amazons, Garrett, Alistair, Peter, Charlotte. There are so many to choose from and yet people cut their options to Edward or Jacob!    Bella is a bit more... frisky, maybe is the word I'm looking for... in this book. BUT good things come of that as Renesmee is born AND Bella becomes a Vampire. Yes, Jacob fans, the main character becomes a filthy parasite. Of course I think we all saw that coming in the end. Since book one, I think. Renesmee is just the most adorable little child EVER! She's virtually one-of-a-kind, too. I was quite impressed... or maybe fascinated with the flip between Edward and Renesmee's powers. So if you don't like the passages that hint at Edward and Bella \\"getting physical\\" (it does NOT go into detail) then just sit through it and know that it is not pointless, as those of you who have read the book know.    I find it quite humorous (and at the same time frustrating) that even those who have read Breaking Dawn seem to be unable to get it through their head that Jacob and his pack are not Werewolves. They are Shape-shifters.    All in all this is a great book and I would recommend it to all fans!!!! It is by far the best book in the series especially since it introduces new -- sometimes very,very,very old -- Vampires into the story. Buy this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    SPOILERS END HERE.
0962477060|5.0|If you're interested in this book, you've probably taken note of some of the negative reviews. Let me say that most of those reviews want this book to be something that it isn't trying to be, and true appreciation of it comes from fully understanding what it IS. (I've seen elsewhere where some people gave low ratings to a guitar tab book because it wasn't a comic book . . . unreal.)<br /><br />To play guitar well you need to develop skill in three areas.<br /><br />1) Technique (finger strength/memory, pick/fingering style, hammer-ons and pull-offs, changing between chords, etc.)<br />2) Understanding the instrument (where notes are on the guitar and in relation to each other)<br />3) Music Theory (understanding what the notes mean and how they work together)<br /><br />I have yet to find a single book that tackles all three of these well (and if I did, it would have to be HUGE). Lots and lots of books do the first and third ones together, though I recommend getting separate sources for each so you can get as in-depth as possible. My personal favorites so far are \\"Guitar Aerobics\\" for technique and \\"Music Theory for Guitarists\\" by Tom Kolb plus \\"Contemporary Music Theory vol. 1-2\\" by Mark Harrison for theory.<br /><br />Lots of books skip that second area, though. The reasons are many. For one, music notation was designed around the piano, so when teaching you theory, they teach you piano. Another reason is many non-keyboarded instruments (namely brass and woodwinds) have relatively simple interfaces, so there's not much reason to spend much time on the concept. And many instructors learned piano FIRST and then learned guitar and visualize notes as a keyboard and not a fretboard and expect their students to do the same (even the aforementioned \\"Music Theory for Guitarists\\" starts right out by telling you to get to work on memorizing which frets are which notes--an essential journey but daunting without a good method).<br /><br />FRETBOARD LOGIC is a book about beingable to see the fretboard for what it is: a series of patterns; a matrix of notes. This book is entirely about understanding where things are on the guitar and how to easily find them. To navigate the fretboard. The fretboard is built on a pattern, and Edwards teaches you that pattern in an easy way here.<br /><br />That pattern is the CAGED sequence. It's nothing new, really, but Edwards' approach is genius in its simplicity. \\"First: here are the five basic chord shapes; nearly all chords you ever use will be based off of these shapes somehow.\\" \\"Second: here are the five pentatonic scale shapes; note that they directly relate to those five chord shapes.\\" \\"Third: here are five diatonic scale shapes; notice how they extend the pentatonic scales--all diatonic scales are built within and between these shapes.\\" \\"Fourth: here are some alterations to the original chords and scales--don't worry about what each chord is for right now, just learn how they're shaped.\\"<br /><br />An absolute beginner will have some difficulty with barre chords right off the bat, but learning the CAGED sequence in this way opens up the mystery of the guitar's fretboard almost immediately.<br /><br />By no means should this be your only guitar book, but by the same token, by no means should you not have this in your library.
B001F290E4|5.0|Love all of the songs on this CD.  I bought it for myself, then purchased another one as a Christmas gift.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I'm a BIG Susan Boyle fan. So I'm sorry to report this album is such a major dissappiontment.  First off,her voice is not nearly as rich and full as the YouTube clip of I Dreamed a Dream.  On many songs I wouldn't even know it was SB singing....her voice is very thin and reedy. She sounds more like Bernadette Peters (not a good thing). I also wasn't thrilled with the song choices. I know Susan has a background of singing in her church choir. But I wish she would NOT have included 4 hymns here. I don't want to hear ANY religious music and just skip over those 4 songs. That means I only got 2/3 rds of an album. She should do an album of all religious music for fans who like that type of music.  What reason is there for anybody EVER to re-record Daydream Believer ? I hated it when the Monkees sang it 30 years ago, It wasn't a good song then and 30 years haven't improved it.  I hope that if Susan ever does another cd she will hook up with a great producer and her A&R people will take some time choosing proper songs for her to sing. Many friends have bought this cd and they  feel the same way. Not good. Not bad, but could have been a lot better. So sad.  I still love Susan.
B002MJV75O|5.0|This box is amazing!!!! It has all the dvds inside the book so is all very organized. It has a info on the characters and pictures from the seasons. The dvds are orgnaized inside the book per season and underneath each one it gives you the list of episodesin the particular dvd. When it arived it smelled a lot like painting and glue but im guessing it was because it was brand new. The only thing I was thrown off by is that the pictures in the booklet are not otrganized by season but other than that its an amazing buy!!!!

B002Q4TKAY|5.0|I was not much of a big Killers fan before this, but me an my roommate have had various live versions of the songs on these cd's stuck in our head for 2 weeks now.  Great all around, \\"Sam's Town\\" sounds amazing with piano, the excitement in the crowd is astounding.  The vocals and instruments all are perfect.  I would not change a thing.  Brandon sounds a little nervous when he speaks but quite frankly I think it is just the way he talks.  Also I bought this on Itunes, so I do not have the DVD/CD version, just the digital version.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music!!! Way to go, Susan!!! Keep it coming and don't look back. A major, major talent.   Love ya, girl!
B001PPGAIA|1.0|I was so disappointed in this movie.  It was like a film 101 project.  Someone had an outline of what an epic movie should be and they just went down the outline executing each point.  Nicole Kidman wasn't the least bit believable in this role.  So stiff and mechanical.  It seems she was just in it for the paycheck and the typical Kidman in bed shots.  I really wanted to like Hugh Jackman but he was just there for scenery and didn't contribute much to the film.  There was absolutely no chemistry between Kidman and Jackman.    The mysticism throughout the movie was a distraction and did not fit in the movie at all.  The young boy  and the king were the only two interesting characters.  Save 165 minutes of your life and watch something else.
B002NALPCM|5.0|When I first heard \\"The Walls Are Coming Down\\" on NPR All Songs Considered I was hooked.  Had to hear more from this band.  Around July 4th this year they offered a mp3 download of this CD for $1.  Got that and like this project so much that I bought the hardcopy CD when it was released 6 weeks later.  I've listened to this CD more than any other this year, when you consider I've bought around 50 this year, I think says a lot.  I've even had the privilege of seeing them live, they were awesome.  When I listen to their music I hear two different bands that I can draw comparison with.  The first is Beirut, the horns and the vocal styling are reminiscent.  The other is Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, their first CD, the clever melodies.  If you like either of those two bands this is a must buy.  Actually this should be a must buy if you like clever song writing and infectious hooks.

B00127RAJY|3.0|I have always been very active but have never gotten into an at-home DVD.  My boyfriend and I have been doing the 30 day shred for a little over 2 weeks.  We did level one for 7 days, level 2 for 4 days (then we were out of town for 4 days) and now back on level 2 for day 3.  I have also been cutting calories and running 4-8 miles per week. It is def. a nice workout, especially for only 20 min, but the claim of losing up to 20 pounds in 30 days is ridiculous! Unless the pounds just start melting away on level 3, I am not sold.  Aside from the weight loss claim, I would reccommend the DVD as a suplement to your regular workout.  It is an easy way to get in some arm toning, squats, and ab work.  The 20 min goes by very quickly and it's easy enough to do in a small apt. living room.  All in all.  Worth the $10 but don't count on losing 3 dress sizes by a DVD.  Hope that helps.  Good luck shredding!
0061478784|5.0|This was a very entertaining book, I didn't put it down until I finished it.
1881273156|5.0|I purchase this book when my husband and I first started dating and it was very helpful as our relationship progressed. We have been married for four years and I've read this book a few more times since then. It's been a great tool in helping us learn to communicate with each other more effectively.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Wonderfully done CD, and Susan Boyle really shines when she sings the jazzier tunes.  She actually has a lot of the same vocal qualities of the ballad singing divas, and I think time and confidence will do wonders for richness of Susan Boyle's voice.  Bravo Susan, bravo!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I purchased this item as Christmas gifts and one for myself.  The knives arrived quickly.  I pulled mine from the box and all I can say so far is WOW.  These things are built like a tank.  The knife is solid, a thick blade, sharp.  Looks like it will be great for bushcraft and is very rugged.  The only thing that I can see that might go wrong with this knife would be the bolts holding the handle could work loose.  I am thinking about using some lock tight to make sure they don't become an issue.  They are allen head bolts so I may also consider replacing them with a phillips or standard bolt to ensure that I will have the tools in the field to fix it if they should still work loose.  I would like to see this same knife offered with a serrated edge and possibly even a saw back.  This knife appears to be built to last and I can hardly wait to put it through it's paces.  So far it is very impressive, and worth the money.  I was comparing several other knives that cost much more than this one, but the BK2 kept coming up in reviews.  So I decided to take a chance and order this knife.  I am glad I did.
B0026P3G12|5.0|One of the purest, most beautiful voices in this world. The music and words seemingly just appear from some Angel's Soul deep within her! Get lost in this incredible, totally indescribable level of beautiful music. Rates a 10!
B0018M6J90|5.0|Great writing, great direction, great acting.    However, this movie has cinematography that is out of this world. Scenes are shot in extremely created ways. Several times as my wife, the beautiful AP and I were watching the movie I went: \\"Oh, my God, what a beautiful image.\\"    I really enjoyed the interplay between Frances McDormand and Amy Adams. Just terrifc. Applause to everyone who had a hand in this movie.
B001U2FASE|5.0|Alvin York is a rapscallion. He is self centered and rambunctious. One stormy evening he is returning from the local watering hole when lightning strikes. As a result he gets religion. There is a great war and the local selection board sends greetings to Alvin. No Alvin finds that he is a conscientious objector.<br /><br />So how is he to salve the conflict?<br />The answer is the story told here of a hero and his consciousness.<br /><br />The movie was well paces and had just the right people to play the characters. It was fun to watch how Alvin (Gary cooper) suddenly and progressively alters his look on life. He gives meaning to \\"I see the light\\".<br /><br />I appreciated the scene where he is in on the mountain contemplating the dichotomy of life and defense. It has the same feel as in the movie \\"The Razors Edge\\" where Tyrone Powers contemplates being one with God.<br /><br />Later it was fun to see how Alvin applied his turkey target skills. And asking people to take a few prisoners off his hands.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that can use repeated viewing
0393316041|5.0|What an entertaining romp through the life on an idiosyncratic and brilliant Nobel award winner.  Some of the adventures he gets himself in to couldn't be scripted more hilariously if they solely existed in the imagination of a creative character.  Fortunately for us Mr Feynman was determined to live his real life as if it was a brilliant fiction, to dabble in nude painting, to join an award-winning samba band, to pursue amateur experiments on ants and to successfully pick every single lock holding secrets to the Manhattan project FOR A LAUGH!!!  Lucky for us, we get to live vicariously through this brilliant and thrillseeking man.  In one section he reveals part of his technique for getting in to adventures explicitly.  On his annual summer vacation to drive as far as he can towards the Pacific (never making it there) he lands himself in Vegas.  He describes his penchant for being patient spending days in a nightclub in order to rub shoulders with bigwigs like Nick the Greek and get involved in some true adventures.  Mr Feynman is a man who has little time for the social niceties and hypocritical behavior present in our society and he holds an uncompromising scientific outlook.  Not content to let things he disagrees with slide, he is quick to point out the errors in peoples thinking whether it be an artist friend or a very well respected physicist like Niels Bohr.  I absolutely, thoroughly enjoyed this book and I would highly recommend it.
015626224X|4.0|Can you imagine suddenly living in the slums and working like a madman just to eat and survive?  That's what happens to the narrator of this story (Eric Blair?).  He has lived a respectable life, never with worries.  That is until his money gets stolen while in Paris.  Now, with the help of a man with a lame leg, he will have to take whatever job comes his way until he can make enough money to survive and eat and to one day return to London.  He does whatever is necessary, including considering writing for Russian communists in order to earn good money.  (The Russian communists, however, are nothing but thieves themselves.)  He resorts to working in the lowest positions at restaurants and hotels.  The narrator learns about life in the slums, about the different slang words, the world of \\"tramps,\\" and the hierarchy found in restaurants -- how waiters are considered better than cooks, etc.  Tough lessons are learned.  Will he be able to see the world and poverty the same way again?<br /><br />This is an interesting novel.  It is said that Down and Out in Paris and London is autobiographical.  Eric Blair (pseudonym George Orwell) was an Eton-educated man and a writer on the rise.  Had he gone through all of the horrors described in this book?  The book tells some interesting backstories on characters and their lives in the streets.  The vivid descriptions would lead one to believe that all of these things are true.  This book is also full of humor.  There are scenes that made me laugh.  First published in 1933, Down and Out in Paris and London was Orwell's first published book.  It is nowhere near as amazing or as vivid as 1984, but it's a great read if you like stuff about the early 20th Century slums.  You won't regret it if you're a new Orwell fan like myself.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|I recently purchased this video for my live concert collection and its a MUST HAVE for true Stevie Wonder fans!  Everything about is first class, the music (can't go wrong there!!), the video footage, the venue and the audience.  He sings all his hits and the quality and flow of his musical selection is outstanding...sings all his hits.  Would highly recommend everyone to add it to your collection.
9113020730|5.0|Although technically this is the third book of the Millennium Trilogy, it really is more like the second half of The Girl Who Played with Fire, as the action of this book starts exactly at the point where the previous one left off. In fact,if you haven't read Fire, I strongly recommend that you save it, and read these two together.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />This book ties up all of the loose ends left by Fire, and does so in brilliant fashion.  It slowly unwinds the intricate plotting of those who seek to silence Lisbeth Salander once and for all, and the equally intricate counter-plotting of those who seek to vindicate her and set her free.  You'll get friction burns turning the pages until you get to the book's climax, and once you get there, there's a nice long satisfying epilogue for you to savor.<br /><br />Too bad Stieg Larsson didn't take better care of himself, but at least he left the three Salander books behind.

B000QQH4YS|5.0|ROBOCOP is one of those rare movies that is a fusion of elements of many different films that work to great effect in one film. A mixture of science fiction, action, drama, police procedural (and maybe even a bit of horror), ROBOCOP is a brilliant satire that is still relevant as both a film and social commentary even today. Telling the story of Officer Alex J. Murphy (excellently played by Peter Weller), who is mercilessly gunned down by a band of criminals led by Clarence Boddicker (effortlessly played by Kurtwood Smith), Murphy's body is transformed into Robocop as part of Detroit-based corporation OCP's contract with the city to help fight crime (and earn OCP a hefty profit in the process). The Robocop program is run by Bob Morton (slick performance by Miguel Ferrer), an ambitious VP within the company's ranks. Morton was given the go-ahead when the ED-209 program fell through. ED-209 was the project of senior VP Dick Jones (played with cold-hearted brio by Ronny Cox). Weller (as the film's hero) and Cox, Ferrer,Smith (as it's villains) truly drive this film with their convincing performances and help make this film a classic. Nancy Allen (as Murphy's partner Anne Lewis) also does fine work and adds to the films' value.    This is director Paul Verhoeven's best film and it's not really even close! Somehow, by virture of who knows what, Verhoeven has managed to make an eternally watchable, involving, and provocative sci-fi action classic out of the most simple of stories and even with it's fast pace, ROBOCOP has these moments of genuine humanity where the viewer both sympathizes with Murphy's fate and is awed by the sheer power of Robocop. The action scenes are crisp and fluid, the dialogue is sharp and cutting, and the story just plain draws the viewer in.     Made in the 80s (came out in 1987), of course it has a somewhat dated look at times, but I even think this can be overlooked as it is set in an undisclosed not-too-distant future, kind of a skewed vision of a decaying economy with dilapidated city settings and criminal activity at an all time high. Director Paul Verhoeven does a great job of focusing primarily on action and character and not so much on technological aspects. Even in those scenes, the viewer finds oneself so invested in the characters and plot that you ignore rather minor details. As I said, ROBOCOP is so engrossing, that it remains universally appealing.    This 20th anniversary dvd is just the way I fondly remember the film when I first saw it in it's intended uncut form back in the late 80s. Highly recommended!

B002OVEB5S|4.0|This is the Slayer album I have been waiting for. After Divine Intervention in 1994, Slayer albums seemed to get progressively iffy. Diabolus en Musica in 1998 marked a point where Slayer started to stray farther away from their roots and experiment with Nu Metal. Then in 2001 God Hates Us All was released. It may be just me but I thought this album was an epic let down, it barley resembled the sound of Slayer and the songwriting was equally weak; \\"f*** this f*** that pay back's a b*** motherf***er.\\" Then in 2006 Christ Illusion, while not perfect, seemed to be a big step in the right direction with more Seasons influenced songs.    *Now World Painted Blood is hear and I must say it's the most consistently good Slayer album I have heard since Divine. This album sounds like a flashback to South of Heaven, Seasons and yes, even some Reign In Blood! Slayer has definitely returned to their roots on this album, there is a good mix of fast and slow material to balance it out and keep every song interesting.     Notable tracks would have to be the opening/title track World Painted Blood. It starts out with a Hell Awaits like intro leading straight into old school thrash riffing. The big kicker is a South of Heaven like break down in the middle with Jeff and Kerry going off on their whammy bars. Psychopathy Red is the best track on the album in my opinion, this fast and furious track sounds like it was left off of Reign in Blood. Playing With Dolls is probably one of the most surprising tracks on the album. It starts out with Tom Araya singing like it was 1988, I couldn't believe how clean his voice sounded, this is followed by a heavy chorus reminiscent of Dead Skin Mask or South of Heaven. I could go on and on about every individual track but any skeptics should check out those three specifically. Not every song is perfect though, actually, just one. Americon is probably the only not so great track, it's pretty unmemorable filler, but still it's only one track. But with everything that's great about this album I have to criticize the bonus DVD. It sucks, and I can't believe Slayer approved it, case closed.     *Slayer fans should buy this album, period, but stay away from the \\"Deluxe Edition.\\" In fact the only people that won't like this album would be people that think God Hates Us All is the best Slayer album to date, so those 4 guys won't like it.

B002H3F7F6|3.0|A few nice songs on this album. If you like classical music: More nice songs. Definitely NOT the usual Sting album
B002H3F7F6|4.0|I'm really enjoying Sting's latest. It diverges from any of Sting's previous work. It's haunted with beautiful instrumentals and Sting's voice, which is so deep and dark. I've never heard him sing like this, it was creepy at first until I could sink into it. I especially enjoy the Cold Song.  It seems to me this project was more an artistic endeavor with little interest in the commercial aspects of making music for the radio. For those looking for the same 'ole Sting, I think you'll be disappointed. Although you'll enjoy the liner notes that give you insight into Sting's childhood. For those with open minds who enjoy music and artistic expression, I think you'll be pleased with your purchase.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Anybody who was aware of music at that point in history knows that Brian Wilson's mentor, idol, was Phil Spector. Both he and Spector recorded at Gold Star Recording Studio in LA. Many times Brian would just come into a Spector session just to observe and learn. After he felt that he understood the\\"Wall of Sound\\", he used all the same musicians; the so called Wrecking Crew, including Larry Levine. Spector often called the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson and his back up singers. It is so evident the the Wall of Sound it what makes these songs great with the brilliant Wilson arrangements and vocal harmonies. All created by Him. Wilson himself has said the greatest pop song ever is BE MY BABY. It can be heavily stated the influence of Wilson's take on Spectors WALL OF sound is what makes this CD an all time great recording. Listen to a Spector recording of that period, and Pet Sounds, and it is obvious. It is no accident that the original recording was recorded in Mono.
1416550534|4.0|This is one of those novels that you just want to curl up on your favorite chair under your favorite blanket and tune the rest of the world out while you read this novel. It is a British novel (among my favorite types) and of an era that I know little of. It is set in the 1920s, an era that has been romanticized since it was right before the Great Depression. It is also the era of the aftermath of a war, a war that the world has never yet seen before. It is also an era where the Great Houses started to detoriate since a lot of the moneyed people were dying off.     The novel is narrated by a former housemaid named Grace who entered the House at Riverton at the age of 14 and somehow her life became entangled with the master's grandchildren, David, Hannah and Emmeline. She barely reflects on her own life, but is immersed with her own tales of the children of the \\"upper class.\\" There is a great secret to the tragedy that marred the great house at Riverton and she just has to share it with her grandson (it does take the entire book to get to the point).     This book is just a fun read though it was very slow-moving at first and I almost put it down, to read something else. Then the tenor of the novel changed and it became more interesting to read. It is predictable, though I didn't predict all of it ... just most of it. It does make Americans look obnoxious, which is a tiresome stereotype that I do wish would just disappear. These are my biggest grievances as well as not having much of a story on Grace and her mother's secret (there were indications to the \\"truth\\" but the author never expounded on it). I would have liked to read more on Grace and her story but apparently, the major attraction was Hannah and her sister, Emmeline.     This may not be a perfect novel, but it is entertaining and haunting enough to keep me reading until the last page has been turned.    11/30/09
0446618306|4.0|This was the first book I read from Nicholas Sparks and I really enjoyed it; couldn't put it down and was angsty to finish it! After I started reading it, I found out that he was the author of The Notebook (one of my favorite movies) and A Walk to Remember (liked it), so I knew it was going to be a good read... and he didn't let me down! I loved the way Nicholas Sparks described every emotion that went on with the characters, by the end of the book I felt like I had lived that story myself, as if I knew John and Savannah. Looking forward to reading more of his books, and for the movie to come out!
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|You must buy this CD even if you already have some of these songs....This one is dedicated to his children, and the demo side is beautiful as though he is only singing to you......voice with very little music!  A must buy for Michael Jackson fans!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I purchased these as a gift for my husband to use in our home recording studio.  They are comfortable, block sound both coming in to the headphones and escaping out while monitoring (which is critical when recording with a sensitive condenser microphone).<br /><br />The headphones are solid, sound great, sensitive and comfortable.  The cord is coiled unlike the previous pair of JVC headphones.  Small touches are very professional, like the 1/4 plug adapter which screws on instead of just clicking in place. The packaging is also very nice with a nylon or silk like cloth lining.<br /><br />So far these have performed and sounded great!
B00005RY7X|4.0|Somethin funny about Amazon.com is that when you want to write a new review, the first thing it asks you is \\"Are you over 13?\\" Am I ever, buddy!!! And every day I'm sadly gazing at 13 like a Russian dog in a spaceship longing for the slowly shrinking earth. Know what I mean!  But enough withs the heretofor poetry. Along with getting a little long in the tooth, I've been getting a little round in the stomach. So I knew that a couple of the younger fellas in the alumni club played in a flag football league for fun and female attention, so I decided to sign up. Saturday afternoon came (and went) and I won't bore you with the details of my endeavor, because that's not the \\"meat\\" of my Andy WK review. The real \\"pork\\" of it gets goin' after the game.   Me and the youngsters decide to head uptown for some lite beer and nachos, possibly some wings, and hopefully some of the female attention mentioned earlier. Well, I'm settling into the booth, and some other youngsters that we don't even have acquaintance with approach our booth and ask us, after we have concluded eating our nachos, if we would like to beer pong against them. The kids agree, and next thing you know I've abandoned my nachos for a bounding ping pong ball and a bunch of plastic cups full of the lite beer. Beer and ping pong balls and college-educated young men are flying everywhere and the bartender turns off James talylor's Greatist Hits and puts on the Adrew WK cd, which along with beer pong, I had never partaken of, previously. Let me tell you, Good People of planet earth: When you think you've lost touch with your youth, and you feel like that sad little dog in an experimental russian rocket, and you don't know what beer pong is, just \\"buy\\" these 12 songs via the \\"download\\" button on \\"the amazon\\" and start living again.   I did. Four stars.
B002T45VX6|1.0|Shakira is an artist who re-invents herself and does it right, but as anybody she can fail. I like Shakira's previous albums, I don't love her music but I enjoy it and think that she has a good voice. Even though I didn't like at all (next to lots of people) the first single of this production \\"She wolf/Loba\\", I gave the album a shot when it was released in Spain (one month before the U.S release) but I couldn't hear it all. I just couldn't stand the sounds that Shakira is making lately. I can't understand why a singer with such a great voice wastes her talent making \\"noises\\".  Her image has changed a lot and she looks better than ever but her music this time...it's not her best. I think that lots of Shakira's fans are not going to like what I'm commenting here but it's the truth and a proof of this is that she didn't get very good critics with this production and \\"She wolf\\" (single) didn't even make the Top 10 in the U.S and other territories.
1416585710|1.0|Lisey's Story is about a woman named Lisa, she is a widow of a famous writer (Scott Landon.)  The story splits in many directions & never fully pulls itself back together.  Somehow I had high hopes for this book, but those were all dashed when I wasn't even 100 pages in.  If you don't mind reading made up words & trying to make sense of them (when most of them don't have clear definitions in the first place) then maybe this is the book for you!  Get familiar with & accept the made up baby talk or else (by the end of the book) you'll want to punch someone in the \\"mothersmucking\\" face whenever you realize how your time could've been better spent.     This might be the first book I'd never dream of passing on because I'm just not a terrible person, and I hope I never have to hear the following ever again:    \\"big sissa\\" \\"manda bunny\\" \\"bool\\" \\"blood bool\\" \\"bad bool\\" \\"great bool\\" \\"boo'ya moon\\" \\"bad-gunky\\" \\"yum-yum tree\\" \\"mothersmucker\\" \\"smucker\\" \\"babyluv\\" \\"Good Ma\\" \\"SOWISA\\" \\"Strap On Whenever It Seems Appropriate\\" \\"ah so\\" \\"numbah\\"

B002NV9AH8|1.0|I'd say this is a terrible album but the production is pretty good, so it gets one star.  Poor Tony Banks, he just can't put out a solo album.  I bought this album when it first came out way back in '79 hoping for an 'instrumental Genesis' album.  Wrong!  Forgettable songwriting, below-average vocals, and just kinda dull.  I sold the album to the used record store in 1979, now when I listen to the samples again 30 years on, well, it hasn't gottten any better.  Perhaps the 'Genesis brothers' (Tony & Mike) should call up Ray Wilson and put out a progressive Genesis album?  Not gonna happen.  If you're looking for Genesis or ex-Genesis solo albums buy anything by Steve Hackett.  As for Tony Banks, he's an amazing player ---with Genesis.
B001FB55HQ|2.0|I agree with everything everyone has said. FoX and WB can Kiss my you know what. Way to pull TSCC in favor of Dollhouse, we all saw how that worked out and now hey lets further fray the fan base with their shoving blue ray down our throats to get the movie we really wanted to see. I wish James Cameron had the means to buy his baby back and do this thing right. Screw Fox and WB. I still liked the movie but I'm tired of the Pg-13 ratings and blue ray being forced upon me. I already spent my money on a 300 Dvd collection! Im not building a blue ray collection. Is it better, yeah, but hollywood has made enough money off of me. Thanks for making me hate you more Fox and WB, hope you got what you wanted. I am just one person but I am sure you have just alienated over half of the fans you had left. Good movie poor distribution content.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I avoided seeing \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" for most of it's release, Quentin Tarantino movies are often disgusting, gory, violent blood fests. Finally I saw it after hearing many people whose opinions I respect rave. It is gory and it is disgusting in parts but it's also quite entertaining! Set in Nazi occupied France in WWII the movie starts with Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) as the most sinister, psychopathic SS agent ever put on film (I wouldn't be surprised to see this villain get an acting award) . Behind Allied lines, Aldo \\"The Apache\\" Rayne who is \\"part Indian\\" organizes a group of Jewish soldiers for \\"targeted acts of retribution\\" on the Nazis. He orders his men to each bring him \\"100 Nattzie scalps\\".  The Jewish Commandos proceed to strike terror into the Nazis! Hitler pounds his fist on the desk and screams \\"Nien, Nien, Neine, Nien, Nien!\\"<br /><br />The rest of the movie is a tense spy movie, wincingly gory in parts and really funny/ironic in others. Tarantino's quirky, bizarro sense of humor. The movie is inspired loosely on themes in Wagner's Gotterdammerung, Hitler's fav. Brad Pitt is hysterical in places - his weirdest role since \\"Burn After Reading\\". He doesn't like the idea that after the War, the ex-Nazi's will just go home, take off their uniforms and live ordinary lives.<br /><br />Overlooked in many reviews is the startling high quality art house cinematography, cigarette smoke hanging in the air like fog, sunlight coming through bullet holes. Older movies paid attention to these details but it is unusual in a contemporary one.<br /><br />The movie is produced by Harvey Weinstein, who viewers will know from TV series \\"Entourage\\" wherein he plays himself, a 300 pound, six foot seven ex-marine movie producer with anger management problems who frequently threatens to beat hero Vinnie to death for cheating him on movie deals. I can imagine crazy Tarantino in Hollywood pitching the concept of this war reversal fantasy to  Harvey Weinstein: \\"You see Harvey, in this movie, the Jews terrorize the Nazi's!...\\". The movie represents, in a sense, the ultimate ironic triumph of a Hollywood Jewish movie establishment over Nazi autrocities.<br /><br />You might not think it would be entertaining, but it really is a classic, good on many levels. You will never forget the ending. Certainly one of the most original movies ever done.<br /><br />Tarantino's best movie since \\"Pulp Fiction\\"., the Jews terrorize the Nazi's!...\\". The movie represents, in a sense, the ultimate ironic triumph of a Hollywood Jewish movie establishment over Nazi autrocities.

B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is a cute romance comedy.  There is enough comedy to not make it mundane.  My friend and I watched it together, then she watched it again the next day.  I love Sandra Bullock, but Betty White stold the show. The scenery was beautiful too!
B002ONC9MS|4.0|And now for something completely different, the low budget film \\"An Education\\", a coming-of-age movie about a sixteen year old girl, from Twickenham, a London suburb in 1961-'62.  Carey Mulligan stars as Jenny, an endearing, sweet, pretty, whip-smart, articulate high school student who thinks she wants to go to Oxford and get a degree. Jobs available to women were secretarial, teaching, nursing and being a housewife. The movie is set just before the Beatles and the Mods would turn British society and the world on it's ear. Jenny is part girl, part woman, right on the edge. Jenny sees what those around her miss. She is bored with school, bored with boys and impatient for her life to start. She meets an older man with friends living in the fast lane and starts to question the need for a college education. Her father agrees, for a girl in the early sixties, going to college is only so she can catch a husband. The big dangers is becoming \\"preggers\\" before marriage. Jenny decides to cut some corners...<br /><br />This touching movie is set in the same period as \\"MAd Men\\" and shares many of it's attitudes. Set design, styles, clothes, music  and attitudes are, like in \\"MAd Men\\", extremely detailed and period accurate. This movie so accurately captures the period, it could have been shot in the mid sixties and put in a time capsule! We reviewers cannot really judge the past from the attitudes of today. This is REALLY how people thought and acted and the attiudes of the English in the early sixties were not that far removed from the attitudes in America!<br /><br /> Highly recommended .<br /><br />And Carey Mulligan is luminous in the lead part!

0385335997|5.0|Of the Outlander books I've read, this is my favorite so far.  It loosens up on the constant violence against Jamie that was in book 1, but keeps the adventure along with the great descriptions, great use of all five senses to really put you right there in the middle of the action, along with a vivid sense of history, and providing lots of the little interesting historical details of the time and place which so many readers of historical fiction love.  Great work, Diana!
1573229725|4.0|Recommended to me, I enjoyed this. Gothic conventions: madhouse, double-crossing, inheritance, thievery, a gentleman's claims--provide a solid foundation for an engrossing plot and convincing characters in 1862 London and environs.<br /><br />This not being my usual genre, I lack familiarity with Waters' other fiction. But if this is any indication, she merits her awards. There's marvelous twinned descriptions of a scene that writers often overlook: how London gradually must have grown and how one coming from a rural destination would first espy its smoke and steeples who'd never seen it before from this prospect. The amount of description employed by Waters tends to be integrated well; there aren't the set-pieces many writers might have shown off with, but you see only what the two first-person narrators do, as they encounter it. This adds immediacy and the pace does not drag. The depictions of sex, albeit limited to one key night, from two points of view, and one view of death are delineated with skill; they remain vividly in your mind. The historical details are woven into the narrative deftly and the novel does not betray the \\"researched\\" quality that (much as I liked it) felt more prominent in Michel Faber's \\"The Crimson Petal and the White.\\"<br /><br />It's not possible to tell hardly anything about the story without divulging secrets. So, a few passages of Waters' prose will suffice to bring you into the mindset of her mid-Victorian two young women who tell their paired stories. Metaphors work subtly, and the women's words are chosen carefully. \\"I should never put her down as the motherly sort, myself; but servants grow sentimental over the swells they work for, like dogs grow fond of bullies. You take my word for it.\\" (61)<br /><br />\\"And yet, even wax limbs must yield at last, to the heat of the hands that lift and place them. There comes a night when, finally, I yield to hers.\\" (260) Much later: \\"There are pictures behind his head, pinned to the wall in wax-paper wrappers: a girl on a swing, showing her legs; a girl in a boat, about to slip; a girl falling, falling from the breaking branch of a tree. . .I close my eyes.\\" (351)<br /><br />These excerpts capture the eerie, yet patiently detailed, tone of the novel. I do concur with a discussion on Amazon marked \\"Spoiler Alert,\\" however. The motivation of that character was understated in that revelatory scene so that it could be perceived as too reticent. The motivations can be drawn out in context but as the critique at the discussion suggests this may escape a reader not keenly observant on reading between the lines. Likewise, there's a haunting mood for the concluding pages that resolves it all while leaving a subtle ambiguity, that suited the tone of the entire novel elegantly start to finish. Yet, this may remain elusive for those eager to account for every nuance.<br /><br />One character, in a rare moment, makes this metafiction. \\"Terrible plots? Laughing villains? Stolen fortunes and girls made out to be mad? The stuff of lurid fiction! We have a name for your disease. We call it a hyper-aesthetic one.

0545123267|5.0|I am a huge fan of the werewolf genre, and this book appealed to me in my search for new reading material.  Once I started it, I had it finished in two days.  I can usually quickly tell if I am going to like a book, and I have to admit that this one particularly captured me.  I am NOT a crier, especially on books, but it almost had me in tears towards the end!!!    First of all, I like how it was divided into two separate points of view, so the reader got an insight into each main character's thought process of events and emotions.  I liked how Grace and Sam were connected even before they \\"met\\".  I like how they are both realistic and slightly optimistic about their relationship, knowing that it probably will end, but making the most of their time together without getting too weepy or depressed.  I especially like Grace's character and how she remains solid despite the circumstances and doesn't change who she is because of Sam.  I love the focus on eyes as well, and how the wolves keep their human eyes.  I found the main characters to be believeable, although some secondary characters could use more development.    Since everyone else seems to be comparing this to Twilight (which is really not a comparison at all), I will throw my two cents in as well.  First of all, the only similarity between Bella and Grace is the love for books and intellect.  Any other comparison should end right there.  Bella was far too fractured a character for my taste and I found myself constantly irritated at her weepiness.  However, even when Grace \\"loses\\" Sam, she keeps on with her life and keeps her inner torment from affecting everything around her.  She makes plans with Rachel for vacation, etc.  Even with Sam, Grace stays true to who she's always been.    The bad points is that the book left far too many things open.  I am hoping that this was solely for the purpose of a sequel, but if not it will be very disappointed to have so many open-ended issues (to not get too specific, Shelby, Paul's attack, the friendship with Isabel, and Olivia).  It seemed like there should have been another chapter at the end somewhere.  Like I said, I am very much hoping for a sequel to clear up these things.  Yes, it has a somewhat simplistic storyline, but with enough conflict to keep the reader interested.  I am in my twenties and didn't find the book \\"too young\\" for me at all.  It just depends on what kind of story you like.

0061914177|5.0|Gary Vaynerchuk's Crush It! reads as a veritable account of one man's rise to success leveraging the world of social media through passion and hustle. The book reads more like a long blog post than a book: complete with tons of links and references to online tools. This is by no means an insult: Gary Vee will be the first person to tell you that writing is far from his forte, and I've gained plenty from my daily Google Reader visits. Obviously, there is no way to currently account for the disparity between the current print market and the ability to hyperlink, an issue that I think is universally acknowledged as something that will be addressed as technology progresses.    Vaynerchuk begins the book by offering readers a history of his entrepreneurial exploits: shoveling snows in his preteen years progressed into selling baseball cards at trade markets, which flourished as he matured into an adult through his undying passion and love for the family business: wine. In doing this, Vaynerchuk has created a legitimacy to his grandiose claims: he truly walks the walk. Gary Vee has an almost intuitive sense of the webspace, providing readers with an elementary blueprint of the world of social media while referencing countless bloggers, whom I imagine have no relationship with the author himself, to bolster his thesis. From the beginning of the book, Gary admits that the purpose of his now infamous website, Winelibrary.tv, was never about selling wine, rather about building brand equity around his love for wine. Crush It! does almost the same thing for social media by exposing the virtues of Wordpress, Tumblr, Flickr, and Twitter to unfamiliar readers, giving them the tools to crush it themselves. Amazingly, discussing this book with fellow cohorts, I got the sense the average college student has no conception of these tools, despite the fact that our generation should theoretically be most in tune with technology.    Vaynerchuk is a strong proponent of the \\"death of the résumé,\\" explaining that your portfolio online presents itself as a much greater case for employment than any \\"tidy list of where you've worked and for how long.\\" I think Gary hits the nail on the head with this assertion. He continues \\"developing your personal brand is the same thing as living and breathing your résumé every second that you're working.\\" Unfortunately, the powers that be within the undergraduate business curriculum continue to exult the virtues of the résumé: they are just as out of touch as the corporate recruiters scrutinizing a stack of uniform CVs. Every potential internship I'm pursuing requires a resume. However, as Gary Vee himself preaches, patience pays, and I will continue to produce content on my blog and elsewhere to bolster my virtual portfolio.

B0000DZ3DR|5.0|Absolutely the best post-Byrds music from Gene.  The added tracks (especially with the Textones are a great bonus.  Gene & Carla hit all the emotions in this classic. Maybe the best duets since Gram & Emmylou.  Sadly, Gene is not as well-remembered (not by me) as some of his contemporaries, but fortunately enough people do remember his influence.  Some of Gene's solo stuff can be an acquired taste (e.g. \\"No Other\\"), but not this fine recording.  Maybe it was Carla that brought this energy out of him.  Whatever, it works.  An all-time classic by the much misunderstood and under-appreciated Mr. Clark.  Gene's been gone for 18+ years but his music is timeless.  Go in peace my friend.  Farther along.

B000W9EOEC|5.0|First off, Let me just say that I am a casual fan of Daft Punk.  I don't own any other album, but through osmosis have come to recognize and enjoy their stuff over the years.    The Recording has a great ambiance to it.  Throughout the recording you can really hear the roar of the crowd.  The music is definitely loud and clear.  The Low end of the recording really kicks your subwoofer into full effect.  I'm sure on any decent sound system this recording will knock your socks off, on a Great system you're gonna feel like you're there.  That quality alone on the lo-fi amazon samples gave me cause for buying the full quality CD.    Alive 2007 does a great job of melting together their hits.  Just by looking at the track listing you can see that each live \\"track\\" is like a mashup of two or three of their songs.  Its keeps the performance fresh and familiar all at the same time.  Its straight up like Daft Punk Night at the club, but everything transitions perfectly from song to song.      At times though, I kind of feel like there is more Build up, beat repeat, and hand-offs, than a climactic payoff on allot of the tracks.  Though, it never gets stale cause there is always something happening musically.    For me, The musical \\"Run\\" from track 3 to 6 is pretty solid, then it takes a slow transition and buildup \\"breather\\" on Track 7.  Actually, to be fair, Tracks 7 and 8 are more stand alone tracks that seem to work in the \\"hits\\" in a new fresh way.  The Last runs that close out the CD 9-12 are all well executed and full of energy.  So i guess my favorite tracks would be 3-6 and 9-12.      3-6 and 9-12 are kind of the meat and cheese of the sandwich... but without the bread, mustard, and leatuce its not a sandwich now is it?  In the end, a great purchase if you have any inclinations towards Daft Punk, it will serve you well.

B0026P3G12|3.0|If you are expecting the same performance Susan Boyle gave on Britain's Got Talent in the UK or in any of her appearances in the US & Canada, you will be sadly disappointed. This is not her fault. Apparently her producers cut the main song, \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" back from its original lyrics, and also made her hold back on all of her lyrics and voice for the song. The result is that we are disappointed by the production of her most famous performance. I kept waiting for her to \\"unleash\\" that gorgeous voice and it never happened. It also never happened on several other songs on the CD: \\"How great thou art\\" never got great with the voice she is capable of.      In these songs not only do the producers cut her short, but she actually on the CD sounds very nervous. It is not until her 5th track (All by Myself) that she reminds us of the Susan Boyle we saw on BGT and AGT. This track is artistic and gorgeously done. It might also be said that her version (track one) \\"Wild Horses\\" is quite good. I have always gotten shivers from Susan Boyle's lovely Celtic/Broadway voice and in so many ways I feel robbed. I am sure she may feel robbed as well as the pop culture machine descended on her trying to change her appearance. They never should have done that, and they never should have changed the power of her voice. It all just falls a little flat. I want to hear Susan Boyle REALLY sing . . I do not want to hear her trill a few shallow songs!     Even the gospill songs done here hold her voice back. Again, this is not her fault; it seems to be the demands of her producers and it is apparent on her CD. I wish this CD had allowed Susan to really belt out her songs. I am left wanting something and it is not here. [[ASIN:B0026P3G12 I Dreamed A Dream]]
B0026P3G12|5.0|Glorious.  Magnificent.  Inspiring.  Pick your superlative and tack it on.  Susan Boyle has the voice of an angel. Though labeled \\"Pop\\" this first album presents marvelously mixed genre.  And the selection is superb.  Broadway we already knew by virtue of the title piece which marked her stunning world debut and glorious ascension out of obscurity and into the stars.  Soul?  No surprise there.  Blues?  Not exactly unexpected.  But Gospel?!  Now that was a bit of a surprise - especially from a Brit who delivers it with remarkable - dare I say American -  authenticity.   Here's hoping Susan Boyle becomes rich, rich, rich, and that life gives her all its best!  Let us all hope we hear much more from the marvelous and inspiring Susan Boyle.  Best wishes for a happy new year my dear.  The world is a bit of a better place.

B000002MUW|4.0|When I first heard this years ago, on its release, I wasn't impressed. In fact not keen at all. But, I realise now I just wasn't ready for it then. Now I think it's sublime. Laid back, late night, chilled R&B. I'd say the perfect chilled R&B album. So relaxing and soothing to listen to. I agree with the reviewer who said Madonna was ahead of her time with this one. Way ahead. A sheer delight to listen to.  The only track I'm not keen on is Take A Bow. For some reason it's never appealed to me and I really do not think it fits in well with the rest of the album. Maybe that's why they've tagged it on at the end, but I really wish it had not been included at all. It seems to have a different musical vibe to the rest, but there you go, I'm sure there are those who feel entirely differently, this is just my own personal point of view. Anyhow, this album is great to just relax and wind down to, perfect for calming the mind, whenever you feel in the need of some peace or just before drifting off to sleep. All right to listen to with company but may be preferable when alone, for some needed 'me' time to breathe deep and feed the soul. Madonna is such a versatile artiste and this album has become one of my favourites of hers, for when I'm in the mood for this type of chilled music. Confessions, Ray of Light, Music, and Erotica are all good, never keen on True Blue, but this kind of flowing sultry mood is something she should explore more often I feel, I'd love her to do another album in the same or similar vein. Lovely.

After all, it was reported to have been remastered and cut from the Original Analog Master Tapes by the legendary Bernie Grundman and pressed at the prestigious Pallas facility in Germany.  And considering that Rhino had done such a terrific job with their vinyl reissues of the first two Chicago albums earlier this year, I figured how could this NOT be good?    Things started out well enough.  The record arrived in timely fashion, curiously packed in a regular Amazon carton with NO BUBBLE WRAP or any other protective padding.  How the delicate vinyl record made it all the way to my house unscathed and undamaged is beyond me...but somehow it did!  I removed it from the box and admired it as I slowly peeled off the shrink wrap, amazed at how true the album artwork and labeling were to the original 1969 Atlantic issue.  Even the included lyric sheet was a dead-on replica.    I slipped the record out of it's lined sleeve and inspected it, immediately noticing some surface irregularities which resembled small scuff marks.  They were only on one side, but still, not what I wanted to see on a brand new record.  If only that had been the worst of it!  I placed the record on my turntable, gave it a quick swipe with my trusty Discwasher brush, and lowered the tonearm, waiting to be blown away by \\"Audiophile Quality\\" as proudly proclaimed by the big stick-on label on the plastic wrapping.    People, this reissue is NOT audiophile quality.  In fact, it's not even good!  There is NO high end!  NONE!  Everything from the high mids on up sounds like it was put through some kind of repressive electronic filter.  None of the crispness and vitality of the classic 1969 issue carries over to the 2009 version.  In fact, despite the years of wear and tear, my 40-year-old original LP absolutely BLOWS it away in terms of audio quality.  It's not even close!    Bottom line: If you care at all about sound quality and fidelity, do NOT waste your money on this disappointing reissue.  Find a used Atlantic SD-8229 original issue in decent condition at a fair price instead and you'll be much happier!  My Rhino LP is going back!!    EDIT: I had originally given this product only one star (\\"I hate it\\") but I reconsidered and am now bumping it up to three stars (\\"It's OK\\").  Based on musical content alone I would give this album 4.5 stars.  Unfortunately, the inferior audio quality significantly diminishes its worth!
143350393X|5.0|I love this Bible.  The notes interpret everything so well, it makes reading a joy.  The trutone leather is great, it is definately much better than the genuine leather.  Don't listen to any of the negative reviews because this bible is amazing!
044022425X|5.0|This is the fourth book in the series by Diane Gabaldon.  They are very well written books and hard to put down.  I would not recommend for the young readers as they can be a little sexually explicit at times.  A history lesson and romance novel rolled into one.  I loved the book, and I would recommend reading them in order.  The fourth book is just as riveting as the first three.
0767840135|5.0|What can I add to the dozens of eloquent descriptions already given? Quidam is my absolute favorite Cirque performance, live or otherwise. The music is beautiful and exciting, and the acts are amazing. the show is mostly in another language, but there isn't a lot of talking, and the storyline is obvious and easy to follow.     This is a show that EVERYONE will love, be they adults, teenagers, or young children. Seriously. My 2 year old will sit mesmerized through the whole thing, and my 15 year-old son watches it voluntarily!     Trust me, you will LOVE this show, and you will watch it again and again and again!
B000JZWPW2|5.0|This book I loved and I recommend it to many of my clients who are on a spiritual path. It is a book  you can't put down as you wonder could I do what she is doing? What would I do in that situation? It helps you put your life in perspecive.   There was alot of contraversy as to if this book was true or not. But who cares? It is a very real journey that you get to share in.
B002S0OBFK|1.0|This movie has made a lot of money for the producers, it is not scary nor tense. It may or may not be based on any fact or \\"really\\" happened. We've seen this before with \\"Blair Witch\\", a DVD that now can be found in any bargain bin, an over hyped POC that will waste about 90 min. of your life. We had no sleepless nights, no bumps in the night, no spirits creeping around us ... nothing as a result of watching this movie.. but judge for yourself! .. This is not a 'hate' we've seen 100's of far, far better horror movies.

1594202249|1.0|I never put books down, but had to make an exception. I like Pynchon, but this was just a mess. Every chapter was another empty character, a plot stuck in neutral and no sign that the tangle would ever come together. If the last quarter makes it all worthwhile, then so be it... I'll have to live in ignorance.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have been waiting for this album to come to my home since it was announced.  Once it arrived I couldn't open it fast enough to listen to it.  I was deeply touched by the quality of Susan's voice and range of songs.  The musical accompaniment, though overwhelming at times, was beautiful.  Every song she sang touched my heart.  I was so anxoius to share the album with my closest friends only to find out that all four of them already had a copy and felt the same way I did.  Her voice is just so pure and so beautiful...so free of the fake techniques so many of today's singers use to sound good.  Hooray Susan!  Now, my friends and I are waiting to hear more of her...perhaps singing Andrew Lloyd Weber's music and more.  Thanks Susan for sharing the gift of your voice and being.
0307454541|5.0|Just a spectacular whodunnit, transcending genre with great characters and a tremendous story. A word that keeps coming to mind: pacing. It moves along at just the right speed... almost impossible to put down, but with none of the hack artificial climaxes that make Dan Brown so painfully unreadable. From a distance, it is (by its own admission) a simple locked-room mystery. It excels in that role by not trying to exceed it - and therefore lives up to every ounce of its potential. There is no sleight of hand, no reality-twisting climactic tomfoolery, just an expertly planned tale. Our protagonists lose none of their sympathetic appeal for their deep imperfections, but are, indeed, made more vibrant by their flaws and frailties.<br />The slightest of reservations for American readers: if you, like me, have no familiarity with Sweden, the frequent mentions of Swedish towns and villages can be quite disorienting.
6305736650|5.0|but this exquisite blend of greed, passion, intrigue and idealism is one of the best dramas ever to emerge from a Hollywood lot.  The script is so good that parts of it have become everyday catch phrases.  You'll want to play it again and again, even if your name ain't Sam.
0451205766|4.0|I think my review is biased by the greatness of the movie... in truth, Puzo isn't the most deft writer in history. But fans of the films will love the richer back story and additional characters that flesh out the broader tale of the Corleone family.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|This is definately one of the best remakes (or re-imagining) of the batmam series. There has been a lot of batman movies, some good and some not so good. This one is one of the good ones. I would recommend this be purchased on the bluray for superior quality. Let's be honest bluray may not be mainstream but it will be in the near future and the prices are ginally becoming reasonable. With that being said, Christian Bale and Heath Ledger deliver there best perfomance in this action packed feature.

B000002WU9|5.0|1995. This year cannot be spoken enough when it comes to hip hop music history. The one year so revered for having all kinds of classic hip hop released during that particular time frame.<br /><br />Two years before, Wu-Tang Clan debuted and released their classic CD, \\"Enter the Wu-Tang(36 Chambers)\\" and defined  what the \\"East Coast\\" rap sounded like. Soon after, individual members of the group started releasing solo albums. Method Man's \\"Tical\\" came out in 1994 (classic stuff.) In 1995, GZA aka Genius released \\"Liquid Swords\\" while Ol' Dirty Bastard released \\"Return to the 36 Chambers\\" (both classic albums.) Then, Chef Raekwon released \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" and the Wu became even more relevant. RZA was working overtime as he produced GZA's, ODB's and Raekwon's debut albums but managed to save his best work for \\"Cuban Linx...\\". This was one of those albums you just hit play and then listen from start to finish. Every track was fire; members of the Wu came through with the guest spots (along with Nas) and chances were you heard all of the singles released from this album on the radio (\\"Ice Cream, Incarcerated Scarfaces, Glaciers of Ice, Criminology.) If you were one of those people who bought the CD version of the album, then you got the bonus track, \\"North Star (Jewels\\"), which was a great way to close it out.<br /><br />Bottom line is this: This was one of those albums that legitimately proved why hip hop was worshiped so much back then (and why many fans of classic hip hop are wholeheartedly disgusted with the quality of hip hop nowadays.) No matter how you get it, you must buy it and hear for yourself why many people play \\"Cuban Linx...\\" over and over again. This is as awesome as classic hip hop gets. 5 stars all the way.
0525421033|5.0|I can't believe how good this book is! It's amazing how this author takes it to another level! What I want to know is . . . is there a second?
B002H3F7F6|1.0|Wow. Every time I hear a Sting song I like, I rush out and buy the album, only to be disappointed by the rest of the garbage surrounding that one decent song. I bought this CD because I was intrigued by the song selections, and it was released on the Deutsche Grammaphone Label, which usually means a quality product. Well, having gone through the album once, I am once again scratching my head wondering why I bother wasting time on Sting. My mouth hurt just listening to him! How he managed to make every word he sang sound as if he was in pain is beyond me. He even SPEAKS through half of a verse of \\"Lo, How A Rose E'er Blooming\\", one of my very favorite seasonal songs. Holiday albums are released because unique, talented artists have a desire to put their own personal touch on holiday standards and hymns. Well, there is very little unique or personal about this CD, just a bunch of hideously arranged classics and essentially pointless \\"original\\" tunes. I wish I would have given the $12 I spent on this pile of yellow snow to the bell ringer outside the store instead.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is beyond expectations, very happy with purchase.  Love each song.  Listen to it every day sice received.  Each song is unique.

1416550542|4.0|A great, light story that makes you want to curl up in a windowseat with a blanket around you and a cup of tea. Moving around 3 different time periods, 3 main characters, this writer is very adept at creating this story in a very seductive manner. A treat to read!
1423101499|5.0|I had originally purchased books 1-3 for my son but he wasn't interested in reading them. Managed to persuade my daughter to read a couple of chapters of the 1st book. Once she started, she couldn't put the books down! I then purchased books 4 & 5 which she devoured in no time. She's looking forward to the upcoming Percy Jackson movie.  I've now read 4 of the books myself and they are all fantastic.
B002GJU54E|4.0|I have read all of the between the numbers.  This one I liked better than the others.  However, I find the supernatural concept a bit strange. I love the numbers.  I can relate to several of the characters.
B002M3SOWO|5.0|I hate 1st person books but once I started reading book 1, I couldn't stop turning the pages. My daughter finished reading the whole set way ahead of me. She is now re-reading book 1 again and wishes there are more. Sure hope Rick Riordan is working on another even more exciting new series!
B002RBZ13Q|4.0|Yes, this is a great concert.  However, the Amazon description is INCORRECT.    The CD accompanies the DVD version only.  The Blu-ray version only comes with the Blu-ray disc.  You do NOT get an audio CD.  Minus one star for leaving out the CD, which would have added less than $1 to the cost.  Boo.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I received the CD in impeccable condition and ahead of schedule. It met my expectations and more.

B002MW50KO|1.0|Stunning.  Panoramic.  Breathtaking.  Epic.    I believe David Letterman recognized long ago the comic genius of Bob Dylan.    Makes SNL's 'Season's Greetings from Tarzan, Tonto, and Frankenstein' sound like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|The constant gardener was a \\"good\\" movie... not a \\"great\\" movie.  It was a bit long and dry... had a couple of decent internal twists that you don't see coming right away.  But in the final analysis a bit of a yawner for me.<br /><br />I like to buy my movies, I don't go see them in the theatre because I can own them for about the same money and enjoy them at home any time I wish.  In this case... I wish I hadn't bought it.<br /><br />p.s. If any of the actors read this, please don't take it personal I loved the entire cast and the acting was splendid!
055358894X|1.0|I expected something light hearted with a fox outwitting the farmer conclusion. Instead it was page after page of violence and gore-and that would be SLOW PACED violence and gore. The plot twists were intriguing but the resolution so downbeat and the ugliness so sad & overwhelming I couldn't recommend this to anyone.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|I have really enjoyed every one of the movies in this series.  If you liked the others you will likely enjoy this one as well.  Guys like Jason Borne are the superheros for all us guys over 15 years old!  Great movie.

B00127RAJY|3.0|The workouts are definitely good. I like how there are three 30 minute workouts, however, I personally don't connect as much with Jillian as other fitness instructors on DVDs.   Two things that bother me: 1. most of the cardio is high impact, and I don't think that's a good idea. 2. There is no reference to how to work this program as a 30 day shred.

B002N4DZ3K|3.0|Pro: This really is the classic recording.    Cons: There is no libretto.  Instead you get a \\"Bonus CD\\" with the libretto and a cued synopsis on it.  You can follow on the screen or print the whole thing out yourself.    The recording has not been remastered.  It's the same one Amazon sold at mid price.    This thing is at mid price.  It has been continuously in print for over 50 years.  This recording has long since paid for itself.  Deleting the libretto seems simply a ploy to maximize profits even further.    If you must have new, or will not buy used, or do not mind having your own self printed libretto, then this is your cup of tea.    EMI has done the same thing with the Giulini version of Don Giovanni.    EMI seems to be in the process of deleting the older mid priced versions of its operas with librettos and replacing them with these cut rate do it yourself versions at the same price points.  I do hope I'm wrong, but I think I'm not.    What I find most annoying is that these operas have be continuously in print for 40 to 50 plus years.  They have long since paid for themselves and are pure profit.  I own the EMI vinyl of this issue.  In 1975, it originally came at $15 with lovely cover art, a beautiful booklet, notes, pictures, illustrations, and texts with translations.  Then it went to CD at $35 to $40 with a cheap book, almost no notes, and a text with translations.  They called this \\"mid price\\".  Now for the same \\"mid price\\" you get to do your inadequate notes/text/translation.  And at 80 pages or printing, you'll probably need a binder and bookshelf.    Most lables (RCA, DECCA, Philips, DG) that drop the libretto also drop the price to $6-$7 per disk.  Not EMI.    For future reference on EMI opera sets, select the \\"see larger view\\" option for the picture of the cover.  In the upper left corner of the cover, in very small type, you will see the notice \\"Bonus CD with synopsis and libretto\\".  Whatever price you are paying, it means you will have a do-it-yourself libretto.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Love 'em. Snap right on. They do NOT look like an add-on. Blends perfectly. I have had no problems with them popping off. They work great, and do improve the feel.     If you don't like 'em, you're KRAZY!
0786868724|5.0|Just like every Mitch Albom book, this one does not disappoint.  I couldn't wait to finish it and yet, I didn't want to finish it because I knew I would be in tears.

I'm ready for the next book he publishes.  Love, love, loved it!!
1594488843|1.0|I am a fan of Daniel Pink's other books, including [[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind]] and [[ASIN:0446678791 Free Agent Nation]]. Those are 1/3 popular accounts of interesting scientific research, 1/3 myth-busting and 1/3 engaging speculation. You don't agree with everything he writes, but you think better and deeper about the issues after reading him.<br /><br />The science in Drive is limited to a few small studies from the first part of the book, none particularly surprising or impressive, that show offering rewards sometimes reduces motivation and performance. Any business manager, teacher, parent, coach or human being knows that there are times to offer rewards, times to threaten punishment and times to let people alone to succeed or fail on their own. Admittedly it can be a delicate decision, and it's easy to get wrong, but no one believes that the best way to teach a class is to offer a lot of money to the top exam scorer, or to threaten to kill the bottom scorer. Yet this is the straw man Pink constantly tells us is the mindset of business, education, parenting and other pursuits.<br /><br />The book moves on to profile some companies and academics who preach more radical versions of intrinsic-motivation-based organization. This is the best part of the book, it covers a range of interesting thinkers and the writing is engaging and precise. However the useful material makes up maybe a total of 20 pages, and the work is always contrasted to the mindless straw-man the author calls \\"Motivation 2.0,\\" which washes out the nuances of the other thinkers. There is a long approving section on Friedman-Rosenman \\"Type A\\" behavior, a theory that is more often used to illustrate statistical fallacies in scientific research.<br /><br />The rest of the book appears to be random padding. There are reviews of 15 other books, short accounts of six management gurus, a glossary with 14 entries, summaries of all the chapters in the book, a plan for physical fitness, suggestions on how to make posters, 20 questions to ask yourself and others about the book, plus other sections; none of which seem more than tangentially related to the subject.<br /><br />Of all the padding, the most useless is the author's wacky theories about how to run a business. You are supposed to make sure everyone has baseline compensation that is both adequate and fair. But what of the people who don't show up, or who hurt the goals of the business? Fair compensation would be inadequate. And nice as it would be if no one were deprived, it's absurd to argue no one ever accomplished anything without having a guaranteed adequate baseline. But this is what Pink claims. This baseline is also supposed to equal what other people in similar jobs at other companies get. But if everyone is guaranteed average, no one can ever earn above average.<br /><br />You will cringe at the suggestions of how to provide additional compensation, almost as much as at the author's examples of bad ways to do it. He seems unaware that all organizations make use of a nuanced variety of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators. Some businesses use quotas and numeric targets for bonuses, with good and bad results, and also add after-the-fact rewards like bonuses and raises not tied to specific criteria, intangible rewards like awards, titles and perks, and a variety of other techniques. Moreover, the author neglects the important topic of team, as opposed to individual, motivation.<br /><br />This book is not of the quality of the author's previous works, and it is a spectacularly uninformed management handbook. We can hope that it is a rushed-to-print attempt to follow up on previous successes and aid the author's speaking career. In that case, when he puts more time and effort into future books, they may be worth reading. This one you can miss without loss.20 questions to ask yourself and others about the book, plus other sections; none of which seem more than tangentially related to the subject.

031606792X|1.0|This is going to be really quick:<br /><br />I never actually finished reading this book because I couldn't put myself through it.  I realize that Stephanie Meyer was trying to write the series in such a way that it could \\"grow up\\" with the readers, kind of like Rowling did with Harry Potter, but it was waaaayyyy too fast and it was waaaaayyyy too big of a jump.  It went from a book that 12-year-olds wouldn't even think twice to read, to a book that has blood spraying everywhere during...I'll leave that bit out.  I made it half-way through and had to stop.  Even my mom didn't finish it.<br /><br />Another sign that this book is a little too graphic?  Summit Entertainment is having trouble keeping the rating for the movie version at PG13.  If they put in everything that described in the book, it'd bump it up to R.  Hmm...<br /><br />I don't even know how to make this book sound good to someone who really wants to try it out.  Just don't.  That's all I have to say.
B00005MP58|5.0|Returning to this production 14 years after it first came out, one can only say: such a wonderful story of love humour and intrigue. For me, the greatest episode is the fourth one when Lizzy begins to realise that the pomposity of the outer DArcy does not convey the immense graciousness of the man. To see how love changes Darcy (i.e. overcoming the real pompositiy and pride) - he becomes humble, he melts before our eyes and his real greatness comes to the fore - all because of the extraordinary power of love to make the lover and loved one shine,sparkle and grow. This is a trully glorious production conveying, as all classics do, some of the great truths about human life. And then, of course, the sycophantic vicar: he too is wonderful but in a completely differnt way. Bravo!!!

B002GY9F9K|1.0|I have been an avid reader and well just basically hooked on the the sword of truth series for a number of years. I was really excited when I had heard there would be Television series made on the books. Oh boy was I dissapointed and I normally don't go in for writing reviews but I couldn't help myself. Really a shame that someone would want to destroy something that was so great. The TV series looks really low budget and very very very boring. The actors, well I guess they play their part but just together with the storyline (in the books exceptional)and the cheapness it comes off terribly.  One very dissapointed fan of the books!!!!! What a shame.

B00127RAJY|5.0|It is a great workout. You can up the difficulty through the different levels she offers. I can't do the jumping-jacks due to a back injury but I love substituting in the punches for them. This workout is helping me tone my tummy and get a firmer, bigger butt(the exercises lift my bottom). It is also helping me with my posture and strength which have both been lacking since my back injury.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|Surely there couldn't be a shallower PM than Hugh Grant's character. He doesn't have the social skills or the brain cells for the job. His crush isn't what most of us would consider love, actually. At the end of his segment she runs up to him in public and jumps on him with both legs wrapped around his waist. Look at Grant's face; he doesn't quite believe it himself.<br /><br />None of the relationships had time to ripen. The story tried to tie up all the segments into a nice Christmas pageant bow at the end, but it didn't quite work. And there are seriously depressing fates for 2 or 3 of these couples. Love, actually not.

For a man that has the credibility that he has, you'd think that he'd scoff at the idea of using any kind of software to correct his or anyone else's vocals, especially live! Unfortunately, that's what they're doing a lot these days. The first time I'd witnessed Auto-Tune being used live was watching Umphrey's McGee on tv using that effect, and it was terrible. The vocals quiver during sustained vocal passages and notes just seem a little too perfect. As a reviewer noted here, that there's a VAST difference to all other past live collections, hm, I wonder why? I presume that the record company thought that most of the general public won't notice and therefore McCartney will sound incredible, song after song. As for me, I'd accept McCartney's mistakes over perfection, thank you! Besides the great performances as a whole, I can't stress the importance of listening carefully before buying and draw your own conclusion.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Having been a Trekkie for decades, I was afraid that Star Trek was really dead. Then this movie came along, and Star Trek came back to life. This movie didn't dissapoint, it's arguably the best Star Trek movie ever made. Star Trek was my first Blu-Ray purchase, and it is nearly perfect. Even on my 720p TV, Star Trek Blu is much better than the DVD.
031606792X|1.0|OK, some find this mound of rotten bile so bad it's almost good. I'm not one of those types to enjoy watching things glimmer in ghastly awfulness, so I just found it biblically awful, and that was it, I didn't revel in its awfulness. I have read all four books. The first three were pretty bad, but they were nothing compared to this. It's almost as if Stephenie Meyer started going off her meds for this one. Let's see: (here come the spoilers) A private island off the coast of Rio De Janeiro owned by vampires so they can...um.... snorkle? Run around really really fast? Have an island that's there conveniently for SMeyer to write into her bizarre fantasy? I don't know. Anyway, Bella and Edward are on their honeymoon, Bella is friggin knocked out unconscious by the sex, she gets pregnant, has bizarre dreams about the behbe and then she has to drink blood from a sippy cup to keep the vamp behbe alive. Even though it's breaking her bones one by one with its vampire strength, Bella loves the demon spawn. She nearly dies from the birth, which is, by the way, horrifying, with lots of blood and Eddie (Edward Cullen) biting the little green, gasping alien out of her (that right there was a gross exaggeration, not the Eddie biting into her womb part, the green alien part. I had ya goin' there, eh?) Finally, all is well. Bella is bitten, turned into a Vampire right away, faces a bit of knife-stabbing pain and then gets to have fun, romping sex with Edward for the rest of Eternity (cause conflict is just too hard to write about in the other half of this 700 page book, donchya know.)     Through the entire series, these ruling vampire guys, these really shake-the-earth powerful vampire kings have been after Bella to turn into a Sparkle-vamp already. But now that she is one, it's okay, right? WRONG. Oops, the scary Hitler vamps know about the demon vampire behbe! (Did I mention the behbe is not really a behbe at all, but has an adult brain, not to mention has a werewolf man-slave to take care of her so that Bella skips over those pesky adult responsibilities that usually accompany offspring? No? I guess I missed that part. Oops.) Anywayz. The mean Nazi vamps don't like Renesmee (Whoohaat??? Yup, that's the magically adult, Pedophile-prey for the character-assassinated-Jacob's name. I know, riiight? Could we make this little turd any less appealing, Smeyer, really?) So maybe I was lying? Does an epic vampire/werewolf battle ensue? Does at least the King Herod Vamp get to duke it out with Eddie? Nope. Do the vamps try to kill the Bella/Eddie Spawn? NO! (I know, I'm sad too!) Here's the most exciting, heart-wrenching thing that happens: One she-vamp, who's like, someone's cousin or sister or something, that's there randomly to, um, be one of the deaths Smeyer could bare to have, is burned at the stake or something- I think. Then, Bella and Edward (who I never thought could be any more void of personality or appealing character traits in the other books are suddenly even more boring than they were before) live together forever as one big happy family, with their own little cottage and pet werewolf-dog/soon to be brother-in-law (but that's not weird at all, cause he's not going to sleep with her til she's old enough duh. Plus, she's got an adult brain, duh guyz) And all the Vampire couples can get together and have as much hard-rock vampire sex as they'd like, for lifetimes to come. The end.   P.S. I lied. That was sort of fun. Maybe it is so bad, it's like one of those things you can't stay away from, and you just need to know about it to experience the levels of unspeakable stupidity that a book can sink to.
1558908846|4.0|Judge Dredd is an awesome movie, but I wish they would make a Blu-Ray version. The action, characters, and plot are all great for this kind of movie.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I think this was great.  The opening sequence is outstanding and the storyline reveals a great deal.  Well worth the time!
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I was so disappointed in this film.  I love the Amanda Root version, and was hoping for another great adaptation, with a newer look.  This version changed so many events to try to make it more dramatic.  I guess it succeeded in the added drama, but in so doing it changed the mood of the story.  The whole movie up until the very end focused on the sad and serious aspects of the story.  You never get to see Anne start to open up and come alive again the more she's around Captain Wentworth and other friends and seeing more of the world.  This lack of emotional evolution bothers me so much more than all the changes in events.  Even if you've never read the book, I wouldn't recommend this one-tone movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|My wife bought this just for Susan's dream to come true. Her voice is beautiful. This CD has a little bit of everything on it. We are looking forward to hopefully seeing more albums in her future. We will buy them all. She deserves this fame and fortune, for her voice is a wonderful gift.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This version of Persuasion sticks very close to the book.  Of course, this is a normal length film, so some things have to be changed or left out.  But mostly, when there isn't time for an event, it is implied or hinted at.  This makes the movie a bit confusing if you've never read the book.  Especially at the begninning, there's a lot of \\"filling you in\\" very quickly while you're still figuring out who's who.  This movie stays true not only to the events in the book, but also to the feeling of the book.  If you've read the book, you'll love this movie!  Don't waste you're money on the newer version.
B00000F14B|3.0|It's possible I'm operating from a subconscious prejudice with regard to this movie (my parents went to see the original Broadway version and walked out before the end of the first act), but I really couldn't bring myself to enjoy it as much as I probably should have.  Playwright/composer Meredith Willson (who grew up in Mason City, IA, in the first two decades of the 20th Century, and played with John Philip Sousa's band) was clearly writing what he knew, and with more than 40 songs--twice or more what most musicals boast--plus several lively dance numbers, it may be the finest of the late MGM examples.  In the year 1912, a man (Robert Preston) who calls himself Prof. Harold Hill (\\"bandleaders are always called 'Professor'\\") comes to River City, IA, and soon persuades the citizens that the presence of a new pool table in their town (quite different, he insists, from a billiard table) is the first step on a slippery slope that will ruin their \\"innocent\\" sons and daughters, leading to \\"horse race gambling\\" and dancing to \\"shameless\\" ragtime music.  His solution?  \\"River City needs a boys' band\\"--for which he is conveniently prepared to order instruments, uniforms, and manuals.  What the audience knows and the Iowans don't is that Hill (not his real name) is a con artist who can't read a note (although, to be fair, the instruments and uniforms do arrive as advertised).  His chief opposition is town librarian Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones), who thinks he's a \\"masher\\" or worse, so of course he has to try to romance and distract her.  But as he waits for the band equipment to arrive, he finds himself growing genuinely attached to her, her little brother Winthrop (Ronny Howard), and the town itself.  He even does his bit to improve the place: by persuading the members of the School Board (the Buffalo Bills), who've been feuding for 20 years, to sing together in barbershop-quartet fashion, he defuses their rivalries; he engineers what may be the reformation of the local \\"wild kid,\\" Tommy Djilas (Timmy Everett), and furthers his courtship of Zaneeta Shinn (Susan Luckey), daughter of the mayor (Paul Ford), who happens to own the pool table and so distrusts Hill, and his wife (Hermione Gingold), whom Hill recruits to the band's \\"dance committee.\\"    Of course the high point of the film is Preston recreating his original stage role; at 44 he still had a lot of zip, and his flamboyant style perfectly suits the con-artist character he plays.  Jones's soaring soprano is another plus, and it's intriguing to see how, even with Queen Victoria 11 years in her grave, the small towns of America still lived heavily by Victorian codes, with an almost paranoid concentration on appearances and respectability.  The costumes are wonderful and the library set particularly is charming.  And yet somehow I just don't seem to like this movie as much as I do [[ASIN:B00004RF9D Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]] or [[ASIN:B00005JKGZ Meet Me In St. Louis (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].  Maybe it just seems to be trying too hard (having been made well after either of them, in a day when, as Jones points out in her introduction, the studios just \\"weren't making the big flashy musicals any more\\" and perhaps had forgotten how to do it right).
0618918248|4.0|Very thought provoking read.  Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and although his ability to make a logical case is impressive, I finished the book unconvinced of a random existance in a meaningless universe.  Be warned he dosen't mince words so this book is not for the religiously sensitive.      My only real critizism of the book is his generally uncivil tone and self-rightous certainty that is unbecoming a scientist of his stature to the point he sounds much like the religious fundamentalists he rails against.  But alas, the great questions give rise to passions within us all i.e. Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going?
B000065K5S|5.0|If you've been nauseated, not to mention totally disappointed by  90+% of the new releases on dvd rental shelves, here at last in this older movie is your reward.  Virtually every, I mean every  actor delivers top notch performances with a plot line that only an author of the stature of John Irving could achieve.  Visually exhilarating and always tugging at your heartstrings from many different angles, this piece is flawless.  No room  for improvement and always entertaining in every way.    Do treat yourself to this film.  You may never see another of this quality.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle personally picked the songs on her debut album. She said, \\"It was important that I could feel everything I was singing.\\" The results are stunning.     This CD is an artist's work, not just a compilation of songs chosen to please the audience.  It is a selection of songs through which Susan Boyle 'paints' as an artist. For me, listening to her CD becomes something deeply personal, something shared. Ms. Boyle's debut CD is authentic and moving in its honesty and soul. I feel privileged and grateful that Ms. Boyle allowed me to share something so wonderful and so personal.    Many of the critics' reviews I've seen in newspapers and online faulted the selection of songs on the CD - too somber, some said. I do not have to wonder what their critique of - say the Mona Lisa would have been - dour, indeed.
B002OOG6RQ|5.0|Another brilliant production by Rammstein!  Till Lindemann's voice has never sounded better, the recording is powerful, crisp and clear, the drumming is bombastic, the guitars are energetic and the synth melodies and harmonies tie it all together in the Rammstein manner.  I'm eager for them to come state-side in 2010 for another tour for it has been toooooo long since they rocked California and The U.S.!!  RAMMSTEIN!!
B002MW50KO|5.0|This album is so so so so good! Great in the earphones, great as background music. Listened to it three times straight through on 1st December (can't do Xmas tracks before December), and I think it will become a treasured lifelong friend. Dylan is effortlessly cool and he has (effortlessly it would seem) produced this non-sickly, non-cheesy masterpiece just to make you smile this Christmas...happy listening!
0307266303|5.0|The author basically jumps from story to story, which makes for pleasant reading. I have no idea how accurate his history and references are, and he didn't win my trust as a researcher. I suspect his statistics and history are very one-sided and that he exaggerates freely.    On the other hand, his coverage of modern races--and especially the final race in the Copper Canyons--is first or secondhand and thoroughly engrossing. It's a book you don't want to put down, and his firsthand experiences with Caballo Blanco and the Ruramuri are rich sources of information.    In case you're one who cares, I'm a Christian, and the author is pretty crude. I won't let my children read it until they're older teenagers. It would be rated at least PG-13. The cussing is not throughout, but when he does cuss, he's not afraid to drop \\"F-bombs,\\" a term he uses once to refer to that word in his book. There's some mature subject matter in the book as well.
B0006BSBUO|2.0|This book is awesome.. however, the one that was sent to me marked \\"good\\" condition is so old that its yellow-orange, the binding is half way off, there are bends and rips all over it. The middle section is half way out.. This book should should have been sold for 5 cents.. I am very disapointed in the condition of this book.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Much better price than many other sources.  Also the batteries hold there charge much longer then other brands.  I have gone through many other brands, and these have outlasted all others.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, although the decision to set it in 1960s Brooklyn created some doubts in my mind that I don't think the director intended.<br /><br />First, you have to get over the nuns' habits, which made me think at first that the movie was set among the Puritans of 1600s America. Then, you have to adjust to Meryl Streep's heavy Brooklyn accent, which is so over-the-top it's a hoot. Flickering lights and blowing leaves are also a heavy-handed device.<br /><br />Beyond that, you can settle in to enjoy a story that is full of intrigue, despite the lack of much onscreen action. Did the priest molest a boy or didn't he?<br /><br />Without printing any spoilers, I will say that I doubted that Meryl Streep's nun could have the power to bring down a Catholic priest of that era. Today, after the pedophile scandals, yes. In the 1960s, no. Also, if there is any doubt about the priest's guilt, why does he act the way he does? It didn't add up for me. Doubts of faith seemed plausible to me, doubts of other kinds didn't.<br /><br />Still, I much prefer this kind of movie, in which the inner lives of the protagonists are rich, and their motives mixed. Its origin as a stage play is evident, and that's all for the better, I say.
B000001ELR|5.0|Considered by many (including myself) to be KISS' heaviest album, \\"Creatures of the Night\\" rips open with the title track and surges on through eight more rockers.  While I have personally labeled a few single tracks on other KISS albums as \\"blistering,\\" \\"Creatures\\" features almost nothing but \\"blistering\\" tracks.  Even the pop-tinged \\"Keep Me Comin'\\" and \\"Danger\\" have a brutal tone to them.  The lone ballad, \\"I Still Love You,\\" holds its own as well.<br /><br />Standout tracks include the title track, the banging \\"Killer,\\" the anthemic \\"I Love It Loud,\\" and gritty \\"War Machine.\\"<br /><br />As many have already stated, \\"War Machine\\" gives the listener a taste of the old Demon persona that put Gene Simmons on the map.  Paul Stanley works all of his tunes with perfection, proving to listeners that despite the absence of Peter Criss and Ace Frehley and the lackluster reception of a few earlier albums, KISS was alive and well in the early 80's.  While Frehley might be on the cover, he's nowhere on the album.  Instead, his shoes are filled by a number of players, most notably Vinnie Vincent and Bruce Kulick.<br /><br />The most important piece of this particular KISS album, however, is drummer Eric Carr.  While he was featured on \\"Music From The Elder\\" and the new tracks released on \\"Killers,\\" Carr shines on \\"Creatures.\\"  It's the first full-length album to showcase Carr's rocking drums.  From the opening track to the end, Carr's superior drumming drives this album.<br /><br />This particular version of \\"Creatures\\" features the band (including Frehley) on the cover in makeup with modified graphics and has been remastered.  There are a two other covers available to KISS collectors, the original and an \\"unmasked\\" cover featuring Bruce Kulick.  As with the original release, it is dedicated to Neil Bogart, the founder of Casablanca records.  The liner notes featured behind the disc on the remastered version are excellent, primarily for the fact that a failed tour, personnel issues, and the removal of the legendary KISS makeup are bluntly (albeit briefly) addressed.<br /><br />Along with \\"Revenge,\\" I believe that \\"Creatures of the Night\\" is one of the best non-original lineup KISS albums.  I think that it will satisfy even the staunchest Frehley/Criss fans and defenders.  It's in my top five KISS list, and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a taste of the best KISS from the 80's.e legendary KISS makeup are bluntly (albeit briefly) addressed.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|Love the series. It has its scary moments mixed with suspense and best of all a sense of humor. Mystery spot in season three is one of the funniest episodes! My children and I always put it on when we need a laugh.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Boring is the one word I would use to describe this movie. As a horror movie and paranormal movie/tv fan, I was bored to death and wanted to leave the theater. Nothing happens for at least the first hour except a few knocking sounds and the changing camera angels. Characters-dull and although it was fiction, you want to slap them for not leaving or getting help if they were that freaked out.
0156012197|5.0|This book was one of the first books I've read by my own will, and the language i read it in was neither French nor English.    I wanted to read it again as an adult, and thought an English translation would do better justice.  So I picked up Richard Howard's translation and honestly, I liked it.    Woods and Wakeman's translations have merits of their own and I can see why people are not satisfied with Howard's translation. However, I think a translation is meant to be read as a translation.    It's difficult to tell a story written by another person and perfectly carry the same spirit even in the same language as the author.  Translating it into another language, culture and a whole new century must be even more difficult.  Considering the fact that this is only a translation of an original work, I think Howard did pretty good.    the content is beautiful regardless of the shortcomings of the process of the language you read in.  I hope those little linguistic flaws won't distract you from seeing the charm of this story.

0385532458|5.0|Not your typical John Grisham saga but still very good writing. Each story is unique but all of them relate to Ford County in some way. The humor is unexpected in a Grisham book but refreshing and enjoyable. The stories can be read in a short time and are perfect for when you want to finish a story in an evening.
B000002J6F|5.0|I should have had this album in my collection since I was in high school when it came out but late is better than never. Anyway, without being redundant in duplicating praise others have written, I'll just say this: When I rate an album with five stars it generally means that it spun for three full rotations in my CD-player before changing and when it goes back in it will spin for at least two more. GREAT GROUP. GREAT ALBUM! GREAT LEADER!
0897500482|4.0|Good insight to Bruce Lee and how he looked at things pertaining to attack and defense.  Easy to understand text and pictures.
B0029XFN8A|5.0|Very enjoyable movie, lite hearted in places, funny in places and a movie that shows what can be done to help another person when you care.  Beware because this is not a movie for young people because of the emphasis on sex.  This movie is even better because of the blu ray format.
B002SJIO54|2.0|The reason I saw this movie was because a friend referred it, I don't know what he was on when he watch it but obviously not in his right mind to suggest watching it. This movie was nothing like I was expecting. First off it was disturbing and out right disgusting, second it made no sense. It never actually explained why the aliens were there , how they even got there, and left you hanging in the end. The movie was really more focused on the main character and his whole situation but didn't really give much insight about the aliens. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 star review instead of a 1 star is because there were pretty funny scenes that were the only entertainment I got out of the movie.

After 4 seasons most shows grow stale and boring, but not LOST... This season it's twist and turns come at a break neck speed... This show isn't for everyone though... It is intricate, time consuming, and smart television... There has never been a show like LOST and there never will be after it is gone.... SEASON 5 is amazing!!
B000059T1E|4.0|What a great flowing album with great internal consistency.<br /><br />Why anyone would add new tracks that don't flow into the middle of the re-master is an act of vandalism.<br /><br />The real question is, why did the person responsible throw a brick through the window of the re-master?<br /><br />If you are moving the recording over to an MP3 or your PC there is some hope since you can delete the offensive tracks.<br /><br />Can anyone say product recall?
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|THis is one of the best new tv shows to come around in a long time.  Nathan Fillion is good in whatever he does.  He was in the last season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the in Serenity, the sci-fi series.  He is very funny, but can also be serious in this crime drama.  All characters in this series fit just perfect and I hope it will be around for many more seasons.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Like so many others, I was blown away by Susan Boyle's performance on Britain's Got Talent, especially as the judges/audience scoffed, anticipating an embarrassing display, when she walked onto that stage. People too often judge others prematurely, without knowing the true 'heart' of the person. When her amazing voice echoed throughout the theatre, I immediately grinned as I watched everyone's reactions. I've always been an advocate for the 'underdog!' (I teach Special Needs students). She so inspired me that I downloaded her performance from youtube, and watch it regularly, especially if I'm having a 'bad day.' Naturally, I pre-ordered the CD, but having listened to some of her older recordings, had prepared myself that the other tracks would probably not compare to \\"I Dreamed A Dream.\\" How wrong I was! Each of the songs stir your emotions, mesmerizing your attention! As the holidays approach, I can't help but wish Santa might bring a 'surprise' Christmas album to enjoy during the season- sigh . . . maybe next year. Thank you Susan for courageously facing the obstacles in your life in order to share your extraordinary talent with the world!    Merry Christmas!
B002AT4K9Q|4.0|I really liked the first Fast & Furious, so much that I bought the sequel hoping for more of the same.  I was really disappointed in the 2nd movie but once again gave the third installment a try in hopes that it would be more of the first.  Once again I was disappointed.  So when I heard the new version was the same actors as the first one, i knew I had to give the franchise one more try.  I was not disappointed, this is a decent movie with plenty of action, cars, and girls....basically the kind of movie that appeals to all guys and the acting and plot make it worth the time for the ladies.  If you like movies with lots of action than you will be happy with the Fast & Furious, its not going to win any awards but it is worth your time.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|You may be able to save a few dollars with a off brand battery but they generally do not work as well or last as long.
B002VKE0XA|5.0|The movie starts with no studio logos- instead of logos we get a title card from the producers thanking the local Police department and Katie Featherston/Micah Sloat's parents thanking them for the footage. From that point, you know you are going to see some amateur footage from Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, investigating a series of paranormal occurrences in their home involving an unwelcome presence of a Demon.<br /><br />Paranormal Activity was made in 2006 on a budget of $15,000 by Oren Pireli. It was his debut movie and was shot in 10 days. It didn't get any screenings until 2007, and Steven Spielberg had been given a DVD screener to watch. He apparently got so scared that he couldn't watch the whole movie. However, nonetheless he enjoyed it and ended up finishing it.<br /><br />I saw the screener copy that has been floating around the internet this past halloween, and invited a friend over. The movie made for some creepy fun, and I can guarantee you that this may be the creepiest movie I've seen, and certinaly the most intense movie I've seen in a while!<br /><br />The first 10 minutes may bore you a little, as before we get to the creepshow, we get a bit of an introduction to Kaitie and Micah's life. The first time we see the \\"in the bedroom\\" shot, it's basically a demo of what we're about to see. After an encounter with a psychic, which offers some interesting insight into Katie's child life and history of being haunted by this presence, we then skip right into the night time scenes. Once the nighttime scenes come, you immediately are on the edge of your seat and unsure of what will happen. My favorite one was the moment the footsteps get louder and louder and the door shuts- a classic creepy moment. THe whole movie is intense, and about 3/4 of the way through, I was unsure if I could watch it anymore, it was so scary!<br /><br />One thing the cut I saw is known for is its ending, which was changed for it's theatrical release by Steven Spielberg. I cannot see why he chose to do that- the ending, in my opinion, is one of the greatest endings ever filmed- extremely morbid, hopeless, devastating, and it stays with you. No such horror movie ending has been THAT effective.<br /><br />I can see why people hated this movie, as it's not a real jumpy or gory or violent movie. There is zero violence in this movie, with the exception of a gunshot and the implication that someone has died. THere is no gore either, something I really liked. This is the scary that Hitchcock is famous for- intense, brooding, PARANORMAL. It's scary because of what little there is. My dad, who never gets scared, couldn't enjoy it because of how terrifying it was. Hitchcock would be proud of Pireli, and I'm glad this movie has been a huge, worldwide sensation... that said, this is one of the best, and most underrated horror movies ever made.<br /><br />In short, if you are a hyper kid who needs tons of jump moments, gore, and ultra-violence, avoid this. This movie is for people who are patient people who let things come when they will, and for thinkers. And because I am one of those, this movie scared the bejeezus out of me. Kudos to Pireli for great direction, and kudos to Sloat and Featherston for their great performances.<br /><br />TOTAL:<br />Entertainment: 9/10<br />Sex: Katie Featherston/10<br />Violence: 0.5/10<br />Creep Factor: 10++++++++++/10<br />Will you be able to sleep after watching this?

There is zero violence in this movie, with the exception of a gunshot and the implication that someone has died. THere is no gore either, something I really liked. This is the scary that Hitchcock is famous for- intense, brooding, PARANORMAL. It's scary because of what little there is. My dad, who never gets scared, couldn't enjoy it because of how terrifying it was. Hitchcock would be proud of Pireli, and I'm glad this movie has been a huge, worldwide sensation... that said, this is one of the best, and most underrated horror movies ever made.    In short, if you are a hyper kid who needs tons of jump moments, gore, and ultra-violence, avoid this. This movie is for people who are patient people who let things come when they will, and for thinkers. And because I am one of those, this movie scared the bejeezus out of me. Kudos to Pireli for great direction, and kudos to Sloat and Featherston for their great performances.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's first album is incredible!  Her voice is pure, crisp, moving, and dramatic.  It is hard to not have tears in your eyes in listening to some of these songs.  We should all be thankful that she has found her place in the world and is sharing her gift with us all.  Beautiful.     I still love seeing Simon Cowell's face, and the other two judges, when Susan  began to sing on the talent show.  I think we all had that kind of reaction.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|The only good things I can say about this movie are if you like visual effects, action, sci-fi then this movie is your cup of tea.  After that, it is bull.  J.J. Abrams insulted Star Trek the TV series and the Star Trek movies.  To further, the ending credits said based on Star Trek to justify his rewrite of the Star Trek adventures of yesteryear.    He insulted \\"The Journey to Babel\\" when Spock's Mother and Father who came aboard the Enterprise along with different races of planetary ambassadors to discuss and arrive at a decision on the fate of the planet Babel.  Spock's mother died or was killed in the movie.    He insulted Star Trek III \\"The Search for Spock\\", the planet Vulcan is intact, and not a Black Hole as the movie turned it into.    He Insulted Star Trek IV \\"Voyage Home\\", where his mother was present again after Spock has his Kattra returned to his body, and trying to get his memory back.  Vulcan was still intact.    He insulted \\"Star Trek - The Motion Picture\\", which showed Spock on the planet Vulcan, intact as always, undergoing the Kohlinahr ritual, in which he was learning how to purge all of his emotions.    James T. Kirk was an ensign or lieutenant on some other star ship under the command of another Captain, not Pike, of which I can not remember.    I can go on and on.  The movie has put a bad taste in my mouth, and I have sworn off buying and watching any type of remakes and upgrades of any sort.  If Abrams would have brought things back in order in the movie it would be good.  To mention Chris Pine fits James T. Kirk's persona to a tee, and Zachary Quinto is a doppelganger for Spock.
B002X20W2E|5.0|With this album Rihanna showed that she is much more than a pretty face who can belt out a catchy tune: Rated R has both depth and strength. Rihanna dared to step out of the cookie cutter pop-star mold by challenging herself and, more importantly, her fans. Every track is a departure from anything we have experienced in her previous albums. It's edgy, soulful and moving. I dare say it is the best album of the year thus far and 2009 is almost over.    In my opinion most of the negative criticism is coming from fans who are resistant to change. She grew as an artist and by doing so she may have outgrown some of her fans but she will surely pick up many new ones. I certainly count myself among them. Keep an open mind and listen to the entire album: it will not disappoint.

1400063515|3.0|This is an overly complex, opaque and rambling exposition of some interesting ideas which, unfortunately, the author doesn't explicate with precision or take very far. The notion that we can't predict the future and that, certainly, the evidence of the past is not exhaustively or even substantially predictive of what is to come is, of course, hardly new though it's true that many of us often seem to forget this. Taleb does a decent job of highlighting this mistake in our thinking and of showing how, given the unlimited randomness of the universe (whether in fact or in principle it amounts to the same thing in our experience), we can and usually do make a ton of missteps in our lives, our careers, etc. Taleb has apparently been a trader and currently manages money and makes a point of noting that he uses his realization that the world is full of \\"black swans\\" (impossible to predict phenomena that can have a massive impact on us) to guide his money management and other endeavors. His basic view is to keep most money safely invested in low risk, relatively low return securities while putting a small amount out there in high risk but high potential return investments, any one of which, should a \\"black swan\\" hit, will cover and surpass the losses from all the rest. An interesting strategy to say the least. But along the way Taleb treats us to a great deal of personal posturing about how clever he is and how foolish most of the rest of the world tends to be and that grates after awhile. Too often, too, Taleb seems to be indulging in boasting and name dropping for their own sakes.<br /><br />He does treat us to a bit of Popper and other heavy hitting thinkers. Karl Popper, of course, is the Austrian expatriate philosopher of science who formulated his falsifability principle which expresses the notion that no amount of positive observations is ever going to conclusively prove a general statement about all instances of those observations (seeing a million white swans can never prove that there are no black swans as long as we haven't seen all the swans in the universe). Taleb takes this a little further and relates the black swan question to statistical methodology, arguing that the Gaussian Bell Curve (that presumes most observations of a phenomenon will cluster together so that the outliers will be so small as to be insignificant) provides a flawed mechanism for gauging risk in certain arenas of life. He offers a distinction between arenas dealing with limited ranges of possibilities vs. those where the ranges are unmeasurable and, in principle, astronomical. In the latter kind of arena, he notes, a statistical outlier is not going to be insignificant but, rather, overwhelming. Negative black swans can, he explains, destroy all the positive returns one has earned while the positive kind will overwhelm the negative returns. On his view, most in the investment field wrongly rely on Gaussian analyses for gauging and managing risk when that field, in fact, has virtually unlimited (or unmeasurable) ranges of difference in its phenomena. Thus a negative black swan in such a field can put one out of business, at the least.<br /><br />Having concluded from his own experiences, some of which are quite interesting, that life is more generally like the unlimited arena than the limited one, he takes the position that we must go through life looking out for the black swans while knowing they can never be predicted. In essence we must stop thinking in a traditional Bell Curve mindset. He counsels prudence and a defensive posture both in investing and in life. Good advice, but not especially profound or enlightening. On balance the book is interesting though Taleb tends to have trouble getting to the point and often beats round and round the same bush. One gets the sense he's padding a bit, in the absence of any overarching theory or approach to offer beyond the urge to caution. His most important points are hammered home repetitively while he spends too much time knocking the \\"competition\\".<br /><br />When I began the book I had rather high hopes because his epistemological approach promised to be interesting. But by the end, I was deeply disappointed. When he finally brings the book to a close on the rather odd note of thanking the reader for having read it, I was left scratching my head. Expecting some subtle yet highly practical philosophical thought, I got common sense in the guise of an attack on the standard statistical model instead, and plenty of anecdotes about Taleb's personal life and the many important people he has hobnobbed with over the years and how smart the smart ones think he is. I'm sure he's a smart guy but I'd have preferred if he took up more of the book developing his thesis and less of it touting himself.<br /><br />SWMe knocking the \\"competition\\".

B002BSHXJA|5.0|This is heaven for any Beatles fan who wants to experience their sound in remastered mono heaven! The sounds are so clear, beautiful and bright they are dazzling--and I would swear I was sitting right there next to them as they were originally recording this timeless music. The single CDs all come in their own containers that truly are mini-LP replicas with beautiful artwork; each CD fits inside without becoming easily scratched when you remove it. There is a terrific, informative essay by Kevin Howlett, too.<br /><br />But it's the core product I'm focused on--these marvelous CDs in mono, the way they were originally recorded and meant to sound--and that sound amazes me every time I listen to them. Believe me; I've never heard The Beatles sound so good. I can practically hear each member of the band's movements as The Beatles performed every song to perfection--and beyond! It's tough to list which songs I enjoyed the most--there are so many of them! Just listening to \\"Love Me Do;\\" \\"I Saw Her Standing There;\\" the beautiful \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and so much more stun me with the high quality control sound--the clarity is magnificent! \\"Help!\\" \\"Revolver;\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band;\\" \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and other albums in their original mono mix versions come off sounding terrific, too. Talk about unblemished music! This was the great music we danced to back in the day; and it's still every bit as wonderful.<br /><br />In addition to the albums we get another CD entitled \\"Mono Masters;\\" those extra mono tracks consistently blow me away--great!<br /><br />If you want, you can also consider getting \\"Yellow Submarine;\\"  \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" on CD in addition to this box set; these albums were originally recorded in stereo and therefore they are not included in this package.<br /><br />If by chance you were concerned about any of The Beatles' music being altered unfavorably by this mono box set release, you can heave a huge sigh of relief. The music on each and every track is nothing short of excellent with crisp, clear vocals and instruments that sound like they're being played right next to you all coming together to produce some of the greatest music of all time. Beatles fans would do well to add this to their collections; you won't be disappointed!ing short of excellent with crisp, clear vocals and instruments that sound like they're being played right next to you all coming together to produce some of the greatest music of all time.

B002KLAL4W|5.0|There's only a handful of bands that first emerged on the scene in the early 90s who are still recording albums, let alone producing truly great music like Pearl Jam.  Their latest release Backspacer is one of their best, with every track worth a listen.    One of the myths of \\"grunge\\" rock is that it is/was really heavy rock, bordering on metal.  Although some Pearl Jam cuts lean closer to punk and Nirvana was definitely more of a hard sound, Pearl Jam have always been a \\"finesse\\" band in my humble opinion, not afraid to show their tender side and write very compelling pop songs.    Backspacer is no exception, although it really rocks when they kick into high gear and I have to compliment the drumming on this album throughout.  I know, it's strange to single out the drumming, but Matt Cameron (of Soundgarden fame although he's been with the band for over 10 years) really does an amazing job.    If you're an old Pearl Jam fame who hasn't given the band a chance over the last few years, I highly recommend you check out this album.  If you've never heard Pearl Jam, you've obviously been hiding under a rock for nearly two decades. However, this isn't a bad place to start checking them out.      I like to crown one album as the \\"best\\" for a particular year, and so far Pearl Jam is right up there with Backspacer for 2009. Time will tell if it gets my final vote!    ebhp
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Martyrs was one of my first delves into French horror and it seems to have set the bar remarkably high.  What appealed to me most about Martyrs was the cinematography and the overall appearance of the film.  While the immediate appearance is clear and clean the atmosphere which is presented is very dark, disturbing and hopeless.<br /><br />The movie can really be split into two halves with each containing their own great moments.  The beginning of the movie will draw attention quickly as it transitions into the core of the storyline.  The blunt, brutal and fitting violence is mildly underplayed by a creepy and frightening ghost/demon that accentuates the despair and hopelessness captured by this film.<br /><br />The second half emphasizes the repetition of the abuse inflicted upon the girls.  A day-in-day-out approach begins to wear on you, as the viewer, and I personally began to feel helpless and taken back by the pain and abuse that I had witnessed.  And while the ultimate reasoning to the punishment inspires some thought, it leads to an ending that is as dark as the rest of the film as it exemplifies the entire movie in just a few moments.<br /><br />The violence and gore contained within the movie are not what a modern 'horror' fan may expect.  The scenes in Martyrs are not over the top with gore and blood.  The movie is well done and the gore is done tastefully and the amount is deserved and fitting to the overall film.  This is not a movie that is bloody or gory simply to be so, the violence contained fits what the movie needs which adds much more to the movie than what excessive violence takes away.<br /><br />Martyrs is an amazing movie that I have undoubtedly given five stars.  The acting, atmosphere, cinematography, concept and score are all notable by way of invoking several emotions from the viewer throughout the movie from the hopeless and painful abuse to the unsettling and frightening demon to the dismal, Pyrrhic ending.

1604244674|4.0|Oscar Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.<br /><br />Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...<br /><br />Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.<br /><br />I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read.rit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.

0061537969|4.0|I work part-time in a gift store that also sells books.  \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" has been flying off the shelves, so I picked it up one day to read the synopsis.  What intrigued me most about the book is that the story is told from the dog's point of view.  The idea reminded me of another book I read and enjoyed called [[ASIN:0316778508 The Dogs of Babel]].  I read a little bit of the first chapter to get a feel for the author's writing style (from the viewpoint of a dog), and it interested me enough to purchase a copy for myself.<br /><br />The first chapter really drew me in, mostly because I love animals and recently had to say goodbye to one of my cats.  Enzo, the dog, is getting very old and weak.  He can barely walk by himself, he urin@tes uncontrollably, and sleeps a lot to ignore the pain.  The time is the present, and Enzo sets up the story by advising the reader that the remainder of the novel will be set in the past, as he saw the events happen.<br /><br />In Chapter Two, I discover that \\"The Art of Racing In the Rain\\" isn't a metaphor for a dog running through droplets of rain.  It's literally about racing in the rain.  Car racing.  As in NASCAR.  Cars going over slick, watered-down track.  Clearly, the author is a big fan of car racing, as the level of detail about which he writes is way over the non-racing fan's head.  Plus, if you're not a fan, it's quite dull.  From Chapter Two through about halfway into the novel, I thought I was going to have to put the novel down.  That's how disinterested I was.  I really could have done without all the racing references, drivers' names, terminology, etc.  I realize that racing is an integral part of the story, but I think the author could have been less specific and trimmed down the racing analogy, so as to not bore readers that aren't interested in car racing whatsoever.<br /><br />Finally, I made it over the halfway mark and the story became interesting again.  Dramatic events began to happen, ignoring the heavy race talk.  This is where the author excels.  He's great at human drama, capturing emotions, and making the reader care about the characters.  From this point on, I didn't want to put down the book.  The bond between Enzo and his master Denny was fantastic, magical, and true-to-life.  Enzo and Denny each couldn't have asked for a better friend.<br /><br />Without giving away any spoilers, I was very pleased and touched by the ending of this novel.  The author wrapped it up beautifully, and I felt satisfied.<br /><br />I'd give the book five stars for the character development, unique point of view, writing style, and human interaction, but I had to take one of the stars away because of the unnecessary, heavy (and dull) racing facts that bogged down the first half of the book.lk.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie is really incredible from an entertainment standpoint.  Some hard-core nerds have been disappointed, but you can't expect them to use the same actors as the origal since they are all approaching 70 years old now, I mean be realistic.  Just because the actors are 20-somethings doesn't mean that the target audience must be the same age and that the movie is automatically as bad as transformers.  I don't understand why people can't just sit back and enjoy an incredible experience the way they probably did when they first saw the star trek series.  I can't believe the number of negative reviews for this movie.  If people had been as critical with the original series, which had a good deal of TERRIBLE special effects, boring plots, and piss poor acting, then the series probably would have gone off the air, and these people would have cried.
0618918248|2.0|As a former atheist (and a former avid reader of most of Dawkins's works) turned agnostic (leaning towards the plausibility of a 'God hypothesis'), I have to say that this book is an embarrassment.    While Dawkins correctly and rightfully criticizes religious extremism, he fails in his main thesis of the book, namely that the idea of 'God' is a delusion. His two main arguments are    (1) The existence of a 'God' or 'Godhead' is as likely as the existence of a fairy, unicorn or leprechaun.    (2) 'God' is the ultimate Boeing 747 of complexity which needs explaining itself if we invoke it as the First Cause.    Both lines of arguments are seriously flawed. Here's why:    (1) Talking about the existence of God is not like imagining fictitious characters in fictitious folklore. While the God-character of a religious scripture might well be fictitious, the 'God hypothesis' can and has been made on scientific and philosophical grounds that show, at the very least, a plausible and possible scenario for the existence of an Intelligence/Mind as the first cause.     So the analogy of God = Fairies is a wrong one.    (2) The second argument of a God being the ultimate Boeing 747 of complexity itself needing an explanation is also flawed. Dawkins assumes God to be a complexity like the complexities of the physical world that can be broken down to smaller parts and thus be explained. This is poor philosophy.     Most religious philosophies define God as some transcendental being who is beyond space, time, matter, causality and thus eternal, with no beginning nor end, no physical nature or form and thus cannot be reduced to parts like a physical system of matter within space,time and causality. Thus the argument of a 'complexity needing itself to be explained' cannot apply to a transcendental, infinite God if He/She/It exists.    Dawkins may well be a good scientist, but he is a very poor philosopher and thinker.

B002QGSOU4|5.0|Nirvana's Reading Festival Performance is called by many their greatest performance in their entire career, and from a person who has listened to all their live performances(including bootlegs) I must say that is an accurate claim. The CD is excellent and offers the entire show except for Love Buzz which was a slight disappointment but the DVD has it so I suppose that makes up for it. The other bad side to the CD is to fit the entire performance on the disc they had to cut out all the joking that the band was doing in order to fit what they could, and since they didn't include Love Buzz on the CD too that really disappoints. I read some other persons review on the CD and he said that there was constant cheering edited in on every song. Ive listened to the whole show multiple times already and have no idea what hes talking about, everything seems in order with the DVD. Perhaps he misheard the crowds partying and enjoyment of the entertainment as something else.<br /><br />Now onto the DVD - The DVD offers the show in a remastered high quality picture and comparing it to the bootlegs it is unbelievable how well they made it. It features the band joking around, playing the intro to the song \\"More than a Feeling\\" before going into Smells Like Teen Spirit. Typical Nirvana stage humor and it's great. And like Live! Tonight! Sold!, there is an Easter Egg at the end of the DVD and it made me smile and feel bad for what a great artist the music world lost when Kurt Cobain died, and how the fans were heartbroken from it.<br /><br />The Amazon Exclusive Box I found to be worth it, some say their box came crushed and dented mine came in perfect condition. Guess I should give my mailman a good christmas tip lol. The poster is pretty cool too, hung it up the day I got it which was a day before the expected time, thanks Amazon!<br /><br />So buy this if your a Nirvana Fan or just a music fan in general, it was one of the greatest performances of one of the most honest and incredible decades for music.
B0013ND30W|5.0|I know it's not saying a lot, but this movie is better than 99% of the movies that come out nowadays.  It really is a timeless classic. Everything is just as Walt intended, unlike many of the disney movies in recent years that I think have lost their way and entirely miss the sense of what he was trying to accomplish.  Many of Disney's recent classics are not really Timeless. For example, I recently watched Alladin and was astonished by the number of 90's pop culture references in the film.  While hilarious, they probably won't hold up to the test of time and future audiences may be confused.   Another example:  Disney's upcoming film about the frog princess looks like it will no doubt be an atrocity. Aside from there being what looks like an inter-racial couple, (which would make Walt Disney roll over in his grave), the movie just looks incredibly stupid and full of stereotypes and poop humor. I think it's great that they are trying to incorporate African-Americans into their movies finally, but does that mean that the movie automatically takes place in some poor ghetto slum and all the characters have to speak ebonics? Apparently it does, and the movie looks to be one massive stereotype.

The only reason they slapped the Star Trek name on this is because of the cynical knowledge that people respond to brand names.

The meticulous historical and scientific accuracy, as well as the probing psychological development of each of the major characters, makes this story intensely real, as if the reader is physically present and experiencing the unfolding of events.<br /><br />The eruption of Mount Vesuvius is set againt the corruption, decadence, and intrigue of 1st-century imperial Rome. That the entire plot is compressed into just three days intensifies the drama, not only of the impending eruption, but of the insidious schemes the main character, Attilius, unwittingly finds himself entangled in. The tension does not let up until the final page. A must-read for lovers of well researched and vividly written historical fiction.<br /><br />Sarah Bruce Kelly<br />Author of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Absolutely stunning! Whether you are a Trek fan or not, this is a great and exciting thrill ride for all. You don't need to know how warp drive works or what makes a photon torpedo go \\"BOOM\\"! You barely even need to know who Kirk is at all. (Of course it's hard to imagine being alive today and not having heard of him.) Knowledge of Trek Canon only enhances the experience of this movie. It is not necessary. I repeat, it is not necessary for you to know anything about Star Trek to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />JJ Abrams and his production team have simply made a great action adventure movie that happens to be set in the Star Trek universe.<br /><br />The effects are top notch, making you actually feel like they filmed these scenes in space, and the action is very engaging, but more importantly, the character moments give us wonderful glimpses into the people who will eventually form one of the most beloved crews of all time. Top notch performances from all and plenty of humor.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|Where do I start, you have C listed actors with Mr. Stone Face (Channing Tatum) leading the way, besides Dennis Quaid. You have an absolutely horrible story-line with action scenes that don't match up. The only thing that made me see this movie was the effects. Even then I would rate them a 75 out of 100, didn't WOW me. I even went in with low expectations and I wanted to walk out of this movie, and get a refund during the first scene. This movie is nothing like the cartoon and action figures, stay away people. The only way I would get this movie, is if someone gave it to me. But even then I would feel awful that they over paid for this garbage. I normally do not like rating movies horribly but I mean come on, this was a gimme. I absolutely loved Iron Man, Transformers 1, The Dark Knight, 300, Harry Potter movies, and LOTRs, etc. That is because they had excellent acting, excellent effects, and excellent story lines (T1 = good story line). Please beware before you buy this, I would suggest consulting with others or renting before paying for a movie that you might not like.

B0026P3G12|5.0|After having listened to Susan's CD (during which my wife asked \\"Who IS that?\\" and I replied \\"Susan\\" and she said \\"That's incredible!\\"), and after reading the editorial review \\"About the artist\\", I think that everything that needs to be said has been said.  I thought that the entire album was magical - each and every track was beautiful - Susan's interpretation of the songs, her tonal inflections, her Frank Sinatra-esque enunciation, all combined to make something much greater than the sum of its parts.  If anything, this album shows that Susan Boyle is not a fluke.  I have been collecting music in its various forms for over 50 years, and the number of artists who produced an \\"all tracks are perfect\\" album are very few and far between.  I can't wait for Susan's next album which, if Amazon will allow, I would like to place my order for right now.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have never heard someone with the unique quality of voice that Susan Boyle has.  I would not call this a \\"pop\\" album, each song is interpreted and sang accordingly.  \\"How Great thou art\\" is a very old hymn which I have heard many times and is ok (in my opinion).  When she sang it the tone was ethereal and like nothing I had ever heard before.  The album was a \\"treat\\" for my ears.

B002SJIO4A|4.0|District 9 (Neil Blomkamp, 2009)<br /><br />There is heavy-handed, and then there is District 9, a movie that goes so far over that line it's not even funny. Worse, the second half of the movie devolves into the most predictable buddy-cop flick you've ever seen, despite the fact that neither of the buddies involved is a cop. So given all this, why on Earth did I love this movie as much as I did? Part of it, of course, is the phenomenal effects work (the same reason I get so much enjoyment out of the even stupider Alien vs. Predator), but there's something more to it, and that something is Sharlto Copley, a South African actor making his feature film debut, and who manages to outshine everyone else in this cast.<br /><br />Quick synopsis: aliens came to earth twenty years ago, choosing to land in South Africa, of all places. The government immediately set them up in a section of the city that rapidly became a slum, District 9. The human natives of Johannesburg are restless, and the government has come up with a solution to pacify them: move the aliens, derogatorily known as \\"prawns\\", to District 10, two hundred fifty kilometers north of the city, and thus two hundred fifty kilometers farther away from humans. Wikus van de Merwe (Copley), a bungling but likable bureaucrat who happens to the the son-in-law of the director of the company that runs alien affairs, is put in charge of serving eviction notices. Things rapidly get out of hand, due not only to the inherent racism on both sides, but because there really are some things going on in District 9 that the humans should probably have been wary of. At the core of those things is Christopher (no actor; the aliens are entirely CGI), an alien who just wants to repair their spaceship and go back to their home planet. Wikus and Christopher start off in a weird kind of colorless antipathy, but after a horrible accident causes Wikus to be shunned by the human population and smeared in the media, Wikus and Christopher find a need to work together to get what each is looking for.<br /><br />What really makes it work, despite the transparency of everything, is Blomkamp and Tatchell's layers of understanding of innate racism. Underneath the painfully obvious exterior and the reactions of the outright racists is the sort of everyday prejudice rampant in the world today, and often not considered as prejudice. More to the point, the screenwriters don't try to pull their punches at the end and offer some sort of facile new-age \\"can't we all just get along?\\" mumbo-jumbo. (Come on, you know that would have happened in America.) Copley is able to pull off everything asked of him, both in this regard and in the wider role of reluctant action hero, and that's a pretty amazing thing for a first-time actor. He brings a fine sense of nuance to the role that really allows us to empathize with Wikus, as much as that empathy might make us feel uncomfortable at times.<br /><br />And the effects! Forget the explosions and big aerial shots of Johannesburg and all that sort of thing and just look at the aliens. Who aren't really there. There's no guy in a rubber suit being augmented by CGI applications here and there; everything you see is CGI. That's an absolute boatload of work, and messing up any single frame could have done the illusion in. Doesn't happen. This is masterful work, certainly the equal of anything done by the top animation studios found in America or Japan, and it's magical. That alone is reason enough to see the movie. (Oh, yeah, and a lot of things blow up.)<br /><br />So, yes, it does have flaws, and it's certainly not the second coming of Star Wars that so many have proclaimed it to be, but is it enjoyable and worth seeing? Without doubt. *** ½gether to get what each is looking for.    What really makes it work, despite the transparency of everything, is Blomkamp and Tatchell's layers of understanding of innate racism.

B002X063OC|4.0|As a DJ who does a lot of school dances I am very happy Amazon released the edited version. I do wish that they'd remember to notify their customers of that. I paid $5 for the unedited version of BEP's The E.N.D. and as not happy.    Anyway, it's a great CD and I'm sure there will be three songs released as singles. I have to admit I liked the first CD more, but for $5 The Fame Monster is a bargain. I know I'll listen to this CD more than 5 times, so less than $1 per listen. I wish I could get that much value from all the CD's I get from Amazon!!!!

B002VKE1K2|5.0|Paranormal Activity (Oren Peli, 2007)<br /><br />For over half this movie, nothing happens. And I mean nothing. Seriously. A couple who recently moved into a starter home talk about being haunted, consult a parapsychologist, tape their daily lives. Yeah, we get the occasional odd noise or whatever, but let's face it, 99% of supposed \\"hauntings\\" come from errant breezes slamming doors or clanking in the pipes. You start wondering whether there really is a haunting to be had here, despite the viral marketing campaign that made this this #1 movie on its opening weekend.<br /><br />By now, of course, you know that it was also the #1 movie on its second weekend. Marketing doesn't do that by itself. Fifty-two minutes into Paranormal Activity, things get honest-to-god scary. First-time filmmaker Oren Peli uses all the banality he built up in the first half of the movie very well by throwing it back in our faces. Man, I hope his second movie is a family drama/chick flick kind of thing. Imagine what he could do with that. Because Paranormal Activity is the flat-out scariest movie to hit theaters in a decade. Maybe more. Why? Because Peli understands the concept that what happens off the screen is scarier than what happens on the screen, and he uses it, Val Lewton-like, to make us curl up into the fetal position and rock back and forth in our seats imagining what's going on. (Note: this is a good time to mention that at least three endings were filmed for this movie. Oddly, it was actually released in three different versions simultaneously. If the Val Lewton-ness of the picture breaks in the final ten minutes, find another theater, or rent it on DVD when you can. There's one perfect ending. If you saw it, you know it.)<br /><br />As well, this is a scary movie because it's very well-written. You get to know and care about these characters. This is a very good thing considering the bulk of the movie is a two-person flick (and I have documented my affinity for the two-person flick in a number of past reviews). It takes above-average writing and acting to pull off the two-person movie, and Peli, helped out by Katie Featherston (Mutation) and Micah Sloat (in his first acting job), delivers in spades.<br /><br />Simple, solid, and scary. What more can you ask for in a horror movie? See it. See it now. **** ½reviews).

0307454541|5.0|This is my first venture into the \\"mystery/thriller\\" genre - I traditionally read more traditional fiction novels like Water For Elephants or A Thousand Splendid Suns - and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo did not disappoint. While it was a bit hard to keep the characters straight at first (lots of traditionally Swedish monikers), it was well worth the effort. The characters are complex and memorable and the plot delightfully twists and turns till the very end.<br /><br />I tore through the first book in a week and the second in only a few days. I loved the first two so much that I had a friend from Australia send me The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest so I didn't have to wait until it released in the US. I guarantee that you will not be able to put down Stieg Larsson's trilogy - you'll want to read it in the shower...it's that good. :)
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Great movie. My less than 2 year old is glued watching this. Not sure if it is quality of the show or he just love nature or fish or animal shows. He does love to dance so the music in this movie is really great entertaint. He loves it. The quality of the DVD played on my PS3 and shown in a 1080p tv is excellent. I can't say much but excellent quality. I've seen other DVD's upconverted and they are bad.

B0007TKNCY|4.0|If you like Katharine Hepburn & Cary Grant then you will like this old style comedy. Also the dog adds a little humor to the plot but it's good they didn't give him too big of a part.  The plot is a screwball one with Cary Grant trying to get money for the museum and then at the same time retrieve a dinosaur bone from the dog which has hidden it. Meanwhile Katharine Hepburn has decided to marry Cary Grant and does some screwball things to keep him from his wedding. They both always seem to be in sync with each other throughout the movie.   It may not have been a great box-office success, but it is a very good movie to watch and have a good laugh.
B000MAH5O2|3.0|I read this book for the second time.  Once during the presidential election, and once again this past holiday week.    It is an interesting read now that we have some distance behind us with President Obama in charge.  It gave me a better perspective than the first time I read it when I was really trying to understand what drove him.  Now I have a better sense of that, and could compare and contrast my views that have formed over the past 10 months with the writing in the book.    Regardless of your political leaning and your agreement with president Obama's views on certain topics, this is a pretty good read.  And I'd recommend it.    Having said that, the book is well written but it is written like he speaks ... long winded and preachy.  It seems that he feels the need to present both the left and right side for every topic and perspective.  I understand that.  It shows thought.  But he does it to such an extent that you aren't always quite clear what side of the topic he is coming down on.  It's like instead of saying \\"I believe this ...\\", Obama lays out 10 reasons why the \\"right\\" have a point on a certain topic, and 11 reasons why the \\"left\\" have a point.  So in order to understand where he lands, you have to continuously \\"keep score\\".  In hindsight, this is the way he communicates, but it drags at times because of it.    In summary ... I find the story a good one, and the writing style reasonably effective.  And I'd recommend the book.  But it certainly isn't riveting.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|When it comes to pop-dance female artists, so many have come and gone since the mid-eighties, but none have been able to match the ingenuity of Madonna, who brought pop-dance music to a whole new level. It wasn't just the music--it was the whole experience. Madonna's artistic choices were fueled by sheer gall, but her powers seemed to fade after Ray of Light.    Now I'm happy again, because Lady Gaga has succeeded in bringing back that whole theatrical experience to pop-dance. Her videos for \\"Paparazzi\\" and \\"Bad Romance\\" as well as her VMA performance proves her creative audacity. The songs of \\"The Fame\\" were great, but the new tracks here in \\"Fame Monster\\" blew me away. She takes familiar sounds from the 80s and early 90s and \\"Gaga-fies\\" them into fresh catchy tunes.    \\"Alejandro\\" sounds like a mash-up of \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and an Ace of Base hit. The chorus of \\"Dance in the Dark\\" has the atmosphere of Maria Vidal's \\"Body Rock.\\" \\"Monster\\" has a new wave funk thing going. \\"Speechless\\" is the only slow song here, but it's got enough wit to hold its own ground. Almost every song has a piece of ear candy that made me smile and nod my head.    My favorites of this 8-track collection are \\"Bad Romance,\\" \\"So Happy I Could Die,\\" and \\"Dance in the Dark.\\" The weakest track in my opinion is \\"Telephone\\" which features Beyonce.    Overall, a monstrously laudable piece of work. I wish there were more songs.

B001FB55I0|5.0|I have to disagree with the critics when they cut this film down.  First off, yes, they will probably never make a terminator film as good as T2 again.  However, this film was very entertaining.  It was a really nice spin to add another substantial character to the mix.  The story was good, special affects amazing and acting was great.  The action sequences were nicely done as well.  The Blu Ray looked just as good as I remember in the theater and comes with a nice amount of extras considering the cheap price it's selling for.  Don't expect alot from the added three minutes.  There were a couple small scenes I noticed and the rest were indiscernible.  Looking forward to T5.

B0026P3G12|2.0|Although one could never dispute the purity and sweetness of Susan Boyle's voice, this particular set of songs was, at best uninspired.  I missed any theme in the sequence; one song wandering on to another without thought for range or subject matter.  There were moments where she approached the feeling tone of her signature song, \\"I dreamed a dream\\", but overall I felt it fell flat.

Unfortunately, he makes a good case for the \\"tyrrany of the majority\\" school of sales and marketing, which for those of us who don't march to the beat of the mainstream, is without solace.

And all in the name of, \\"give the public what they want,\\" leaving us with the same moral compass as that of a crack dealer.  Welcome to Modern Capitalism 101.   Is this a good thing?

B002H3F7F6|5.0|I decided to pop in my new Sting CD while decorating my house for Christmas the other day, and I have to say I can't stop listening to it.  I am now listening to it for the 5th or 6th time.      The music is beautiful.  Like a walk through a forest in winter, the music is peaceful, joyful, and haunting.      I'm a Sting fan, in general, and I have to say this is my new favorite.  It would be great music for a holiday dinner party.  I get really sick of the same cheesy Christmas songs on the radio, and this song is just as the title indicates -- a Winter's Night--a unique album for the holidays that doesn't have the same affected, campy Christmas ditties included on most pop star holiday albums.      It has mild overtones of Christmas, but sounds innovative in its unique combination of traditional folk and Celtic instruments along with Sting's soulful voice that creates music that is deeply genuine.  I don't think I will get tired of this album anytime soon.

0345479092|2.0|A friend of mine recommended this book, but I was hesitant to buy it after reading its reviews since I thought it might not be a good fit for my parenting style which leans toward attachment parenting.  I decided to try it though after struggling through the No-cry sleep solution without much luck though.  One major issue i had with the book was with the EASY schedule.  Highly regimented schedules are great for adults and maybe even an older child, but the reality is that you can't schedule your baby down to every minute of the day. at one point i remember reading about how things go off course and you might find yourself 15 minutes off your scheduled day and she made it seem like a disaster.  really?  15 minutes off your meal or nap time is irreparable damage?  i don't think so.  the general idea of eating, having some activity and then sleeping is pretty common sense, but i find that there are always times that you don't go in that order and that's ok too.  sometimes my baby falls asleep nursing and i'm certainly not going to poke her till she wakes up so she can have activity before her nap.   Babies aren't robots and i found it be very unnatural to try and force these time constraints in order to stay on schedule. Another major issue i had was that that author thought rocking, singing, jiggling, nursing your baby to sleep was pretty much asking for sleep issues or that it's somehow bad for you to do.  i agree that perhaps that your baby can get so used to one way of falling asleep and that you may need to try other ways to help your baby sleep, but it's a very cold thing to dismiss these loving moments with your baby.  i have loved those moments of rocking and nursing my baby to sleep, and i wouldn't say that was a mistake at all.    i did give a try to her pick up/put down method though, but i personally found it gave my baby more false hope than it did to help her fall asleep on her own- not to mention the strain on my back. i ended up letting her cry, but staying by her side and talking/patting her which worked well after one hard 1 1/2 hour crying episode.  i also found her categorization of babies annoying.  it makes you think you need to try to pin your baby into one of these types, but i have a hard time figuring out why this would help you in any way unless you have a colicky baby.  your baby is going to do what she or he is going to do, regardless of the label you try to give him/her.  i also found her writing to be condescending towards parents who don't share her viewpoint.
B000J10EQU|2.0|The adventure is acceptable enough, but what's with the adultery theme?<br /><br />This outing sees Lois Lane virtually married to another man.  Nevertheless, the Man of Steel (whom I had thought above such things), uses his X-ray vision to spy on her, leer at her, hold her, take her for unsupervised romantic night flights, etc.  Would you still feel okay watching this if Lois were your wife?<br /><br />Yeah, something was not right about this.  This whole thing gave me an uncomfortable feeling because you got the idea that Superman was wrongly trying to reclaim fields he had forsaken.<br /><br />Another bummer was the script never really let Kevin Spacey take off like you know he could have.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|When it comes to remakes I am always hesitant....and in this case it almost seemes like the star trek craze had played itself out........I was wrong and seeing as how this is not nearly the first time I should not have been surprised.    I enjoyed all of the actors' portayals...Kirk was very unconventional and cocky, though able to back it up. Spock was played extremely well although I dont think I like the thing with the communications officer...but its not that bad. Bones was my favorite, played very well by Karl Urban and he takes the same irritated older man approach to the role and some hilarity ensues.     One thing I wasnt too crazy about was the Romulan ship. The design was so crazy looking and confusing that it was difficult at times to tell what one was looking at. I thought the Romulan ship from Nemesis was much better but this is a minor stickin point only.     The special effects are very good and all the Starfleet vessels look retro but the computers and navigation systems have that futuristic feel....no complaints at all in this department.      I am sure many Star Trek purists are up in arms about many nit picky things....I found the movie to be quite fun and hey there is a hot, half naked green chick in it...how can you go wrong?
B002X02V02|4.0|I purchased this CD after seeing a couple of her acoustic performances online and seeing how talented Gaga actually is.  This is the first Pop music CD I have ever purchased and I am so happy I did.  Lyrically some of the songs are really good.  I love analogies she uses in certain songs like Poker Face.  For some upbeat, dance, feel good music I would recommend it.
B0002EXH54|5.0|while RUST IN PEACE is my favorite MEGADETH cd, this one is a classic. with exception of I AIN'T SUPERSTITOUS,this album shows what (as dave calls it)real SPEED METAL is all about.people can argue about the remastered/renixed or the original versions of this cd all they want , either way it's a CLASSIC.
B000CNE092|5.0|A wonderful movie.  My little girl adores the music & storyline.  I love it, too.  Honestly, I think I purchased this one more for me, than for my daughter.  The story of Anastasia is a sad mystery.  This movie is loosely historical, but it's a great movie to watch, none the less.

B000UBMWG4|4.0|I received my Blade Runner set this past week.  I put in Disc 1, the Final Cut, and I think I got the Workprint instead.  I also reviewed Disc 5 and it seemed to be the same as Disc 1.    Disc 1 contains a version where there is no opening credits, but just the dictionary definition of Replicant.  This is the workprint version, correct????    I know this has been a problem in the past (wrong editions on discs) but I thought this was resolved.    I called Warner Brothers and they are sending me the correct disc for the Final Cut, at no charge.    We'll see what happens....
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|As an original CGI fan, namely for the Shreks and Little Nemo, I have to say, this is the best thing I've seen since those movies. There were a lot of silly CGI movies that scrambled for the coat tails of Little Nemo, but they didn't seem half as interesting in their stories and stylizations. Glad I came to and got up the gumption to see Up. It's a movie that'll move you in every way possible. I needed both a good laugh and a good cry, and this movie was magic. So full of spirit!

Story line is the first fierce fighting in Vietnam involving a North Vietnamese battalion against an American strength battalion. This is a must read to start one analysis: is there an analogy with Afghanistan and the President December 1, 2009 decision to surge 30,000 more American troops to Afghanistan bring troop levels well above 100,000? How does the surge square with President Obama's campaign platform was to withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan? Will Afghanistan be another Vietnam for the United States?

B00001QEE9|1.0|The one I bought at a premium price was advertised as being new and sealed.  It was from an affiliated store with Amazon.com  The seller went by at least 3 different names and one was ?\\"Milano\\".  What I rec'd was a pirated piece of junk.  When I complained, the crook said he made a mistake and would replace the video but that I should not tell Amazon that I had been sent junk.  I never did get the promised video from that crook and so I stopped ordering anything outside the Amazon.com system for a long time and I still do not like the idea of ordering outside the system.  I guess the only good thing to come from this is that the pirating crook did not get ahold of my credit card info because he probably would have stollen my identity and run up my bill.

B001F12J48|2.0|This movie is a hit and will become a classic to future generations. Well done to those that teamed-up to make it. HOWEVER: the 3-D version does not work. We waited for days after purchasing this version to see it on thanksgiving day as a family. What a disappointment! My husband and I got an instant headache just by watching it for a few minutes with the 3-D glasses on. We tried the blue ray dvd player and even real 3-D glasses from the theater... nothing worked. To their credit, a few scenes were OK, (we skipped the movie to the most visually stimulating scenes), but generally speaking is not worth to hurt your family's eyes when the original version is almost 3-D by itself! I very rarely review an item online, but once cd's or dvd's are opened they are not exchangeable (unless is the same item),or allowed for returns. I hope this info is useful.

B002MW50KO|4.0|Reading all the reviews by boomer hippies who have been \\"following Dylan for 40 years\\" and hate the Christmas album, I'm moved to write a review (my first) or at least comment on the dissenters--I've never seen a review breakout that's so polarized. I read these 1-star reviews and think the writers haven't had a day of fun in their life, lighten up--It's Christmas! Frankly, it's a shame that people have had to be Dylan fans for 40 years and they couldn't start listening to him in 1997, and have Time Out of Mind be their first record. I love his wheezy voice--it sounds traveled and wise and punctuates phrasing and words unlike any other singer. I personally like every post-1997 album better than anything that preceded it--those 1960s albums are frozen in the past. I'll admit that somewhere between Modern Times and Together Through Life his voice lost some of the warmth, or he just decided to crank up the rawness. It certainly shows up here, and he gets my sympathy on the high notes on some of these songs. On the other hand, Christmas songs have never sounded more alive than on Winter Wonderland (when he cuts in with \\"before the other kind go knock him down\\" I always smile, because it's Bob), did anybody really listen to Do You Hear What I Hear and notice \\"pray for peace people everywhere\\" as much as on this record?, I'll Be Home for Christmas (never has the song sounded so close to its intent--this person won't be home, despite his heart), The Christmas Blues is worth the cost of the album and so is Must be Santa--what fun! (Actually, buying a meal for the homeless and hungry at Christmas is worth the price of a blank CD--that we get new Dylan material is a high bonus). Merry Christmas!

B0000B1OFL|4.0|You know those films that you know are technically `bad' but that fill you with such giddy excitement you can't help but totally love them?  This is one of those films for me.  The plot is nothing short of ridiculous, completely unrealistic and none-to original, but I still can't help but totally adore this movie.  It is fun and exciting and intense, regardless of the predictability of it all.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original (staring the BRILLIANT Michael Caine) but I really should!<br /><br />The film revolves around a group of professional thieves who join forces with the daughter of a respected partner who was murdered and robbed by someone they trusted.  What follows is a slew of preposterous yet highly entertaining sequences of tricks, gadgets and slowly boiling sensual chemistry (Marky Mark and Charlize make a beautiful pair, don't you think?).<br /><br />Wahlberg is a reliable leading man.  He isn't doused with talent like some other actors his age, but he has a likable charm (that whole Brooklyn attitude sits well on him) and he knows how to work a scene.  Charlize Theron has talent (thus the Oscar) but she doesn't really use it in fluff films like this.  She doesn't elevate any of her scenes, but she is gorgeous, which is all this role really required of her.  Edward Norton is the most talented actor here (well, one could debate between him and Sutherland, but la'Donald isn't in more than five minutes of this) and he shows it by oozing a sensual creepiness that makes his irresistible and completely commanding.  That dinner confrontation scene alone is just jaw dropping intensity wrapped up in a dapper little package.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does their job.  Jason Statham is brooding and buff and a total lady killer; Seth Green is comic relief of the nerdy kind; Mos Def is quiet, charming and totally likable.  They work very well.<br /><br />The film is chuck-full of brilliantly paced chase scenes (those ugly little cars have never been so cool), beautifully choreographed action sequences (not to mention beautifully photographed landscapes) and clever tricks that gloss over the plot holes nicely.  With enough going for it to outweigh to stuff working against it, `The Italian Job' is one of those `bad' movies I can totally stand behind.<br /><br />It makes me smile.n sequences (not to mention beautifully photographed landscapes) and clever tricks that gloss over the plot holes nicely.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I grew up watching this show with my family, and fell in love with the pioneer life and Byron Sully. Sully and Michaela were just an amazing romance that just isn't shown anymore. My dad loved Jane Seymore and she was a fantastic actress. Loved the stories with the children, the way our cities were developed, how lifestyles were back then, and all of the supporting cast was outstanding.    When I see the stupid reality shows nowadays, and the raunchy comedies and the gory, gross dramatic shows, I realize how precious this series was and how there probably won't be anything like it for a long time. I bought this set because I want to sit with my family and not be embarassed by what is being showed, and see a real story with interesting characters, and learn something about history.
B001PKHS68|4.0|Lighter Hitchcock, `To Catch a Thief' is fun, entertaining and delightful, but sadly it is so light and fluffy that it remains forgettable and rather uninspired.  Cary Grant and Grace Kelly make for a beautiful (despite his overly tanned physic) and engaging on-screen couple, but this tale of thievery and romance is very `been-there-done-that' with little to make it demand our attention a second time.  It possesses Hitchcock's astounding visual sense, but it lacks the edge that he lends to his other films.<br /><br />When a slew of burglaries reminiscent of those committed by John `The Cat' Robie make Robie the prime suspect he finds that he is using his talent to track down the real thief and clear his name.  Along the way he finds himself romantically involved with the beautiful (and wealthy) Frances Stevens, a young woman who happens to have an inkling as to who John `really' is.  As he gets closer and closer to the truth he finds that the truth may very well be the end (literally) of `The Cat'.<br /><br />Like I said, the film is good, but there isn't really any `pop' here.  The acting is fine.  Cary Grant was used a lot by Hitchcock, but for me this is one of his less creative and interesting performances.  He is ridiculously tan here, which also makes him look rather leathery and old, which takes away from his `he's so cute and charming' appeal.  For me, this film is elevated because Grace Kelly is so deliciously charming here.  She really carries the film, and her natural giddy almost childish infatuation with Robie's true identity is appealing and engaging.<br /><br />I love her.<br /><br />The final rooftop chase scene is brilliant (leave it to Hitchcock to capture some suspense), I just wish that the rest of the film had had that crafty intensity.  Instead, this feels like a warmed over love story with a chase scene or two thrown in for good measure.  It could have really been something better if it had switched focus to something more admirable.  Still, it gets a B from me, a low B, but a B.  It is lightweight Hitch, but it's still Hitch, and it contains some of his signature director touches that make this a worthy viewing, even if it is only once.<br /><br />This is still better than the dreadfully overrated `Rear Window'.a B.  It is lightweight Hitch, but it's still Hitch, and it contains some of his signature director touches that make this a worthy viewing, even if it is only once.

B001DXS4E2|4.0|This film, while not as showy as White Christmas, is very entertaining and provides Bing with a more intimate setting for his debut version of the song White Christmas. Fred Astaire is his usual professional self with some pretty imaginative dance numbers, most notably the fire cracker \\"stomp\\".  The colorization process is rather muted throughout the film but really shines though in the Fourth of July segment. The bonus material is first rate with Fred's daughter providing valuable insight into her father's career and the CD allowed me to take those catchy tunes on the road.  Highly recommended.

B000GDH9JQ|4.0|A fairly pedestrian Iron Curtain drama, redeemed by the extraordinary athleticism of Mikhail Baryshnikov. In comparison, Gregory Hines is a bit player. Two highlights - the opening ballet of Le Jeune Homme et La Mort, and the scene in the middle of the film where Baryshnikov dances his rage against the Soviet system to Vysotsky's \\"The Horses\\". All the pain of Russia's tormented history can be heard in Vysotsky's voice. When he died in his early forties, one million people attended his funeral.

0782008364|5.0|1996, The Wachowski brothers write and direct their first film, Bound. Their next movies are incredible landmarks in film history, The Matrix series. They also do V for Vendetta and Speed Racer. Bound is worth watching to see where these brothers started. Then add a decent film noir story line, a bit of mystery, and an amazing chemistry between the two female leads; and you have a movie that is pretty darn good.<br /><br />The film is about Corky (Gina Gershon), an ex-con, rehabbing a condo next door to Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly). The film opens with a shot of Corky tied up with a cut on her forehead in the bottom of a closet. There is a jump cut to an elevator scene with a couple where Corky is not injured; clearly the film has moved back in time. The couple is flamboyant, Violet dressed in a leather jacket, short black mini-skirt, stiletto heels, and black stockings (she looks the part of a rental); and Caesar dressed in an expensive suit, and overcoat. There's a clue from the glances at Corky, there will be something sexual between the two women. The walls between the two condos are paper thin, and Corky can't help but hear the groans and pounding next door. The next day Violet apologizes to Corky for the noise, the sexual tension between the two is incredible in this scene; it is a very powerful moment. From here the film takes twists and turns and follows a good film noir path, reminiscent of The Postman Always Rings Twice, most Bogart films, Raymond Chandler, and Dashiell Hammett.<br /><br />As an historical piece, the start of the Wachowski brother's career, this is an excellent film. The brothers showed amazing talent in this first film, mixing up the timeline without the title crutch (an earlier scene followed by a title that says - 'six days earlier'), using unusual camera angles and powerful framing, understanding pacing, and giving just the right clues to make the mystery work. There was also a passion in this film; the rawness between Corky and Violet was amazing. The brothers handled this relationship rather well.<br /><br />The performances were surprisingly fine. Jennifer Tilly can be very annoying; she has that high voice that projects dumb. In Bound this is used to a huge advantage, she does sound not so bright, as if she is just a show piece, toy for Caesar; but yet she ends up incredibly intelligent. A little of the Edith Bunker syndrome. There is no denying Jennifer Tilly is stunningly beautiful in this film, the nude scene between her and Gina Gershwin is memorable. Gina Gershon treads the line between butch lesbian and tender woman very nicely. The only moment that doesn't work very well is the shot of her painting the ceiling - there's a bit too much hesitation in the movements, it didn't look natural enough for a real handyman. That aside, her performance was excellent. Joe Pantoliano would, 4 years later, play Ralphie in the Sopranos. He did a good job with this character, a not so bright mob guy. Caesar will seem very familiar to anyone that has seen the Sopranos.<br /><br />The version I watched was unrated, it is definitely a film for mature audiences. From the director commentary, there is an explicit intimate scene with Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon that was cut from or edited for the US release of this film. Oddly the portion cut is a critical story element, and it is unfortunate that Americans had to wait for the DVD to see that moment. That is the only moment of full frontal nudity in the film. There is a strong lesbian thread to the film. Violence is handled rather nicely by the Wachowski brothers. There are some brutal moments in the film, a head slammed into a toilet, several people being shot, fingers being cut off by pruning shears, and blood splatters and spills. Interestingly, not all these moments are shown in full glory, the finger cutting was not shown, but implied. There is a ton of strong language. There was no drug use, except for people drinking liquorand beer. The cover art and descriptions might imply that this film is about bondage, it is not in the literal sense of the term. It is about bondage from a psychological standpoint. This is a mature audience only film.<br /><br />This version is an hour and forty one minutes. About three quarters of the way through, I found myself doing a little bit of fast forwarding. The story kind of stalled or got a bit repetitive at this point. Maybe the film was 5 minutes too long near the end. There were a couple of scenes earlier in the film that could have been longer. The DVD is sparse; it includes the movie, chapter menu, the trailer, and an alternate audio track with director commentary (which is surprisingly good).<br /><br />I was very slow to warm up to this film; in fact I thought this was going to be a really bad film. I was pleasantly surprised to find a very good film. It isn't a film for everyone.descriptions might imply that this film is about bondage, it is not in the literal sense of the term.

B000MV90IU|1.0|I have both the standard DVD and now (unfortunately) have the Blu-ray DVD.  I was very disappointed in the extremely grainy picture quality on this disc.  After watching the movie on Blu-ray I inserted the standard DVD and compared a few scenes.  The main difference I can see on the Blu-ray copy is that some scenes appeared brighter.  Even on sale for $9.99 this was a waste of money.      Since initially writing this review I have decided there is one benefit to the poor quality of this blu-ray release.  It will actually save me money because I now have no desire to replace any movie in my existing collection of standard DVD's with its blu-ray counterpart. Probably not the result Warner Home Video was looking for, but what they should have expected.
B002TYZKIM|3.0|I have never been a huge Michael Jackson fan, although I have always enjoyed his music.  Futher, I think his most lasting artistic contribution will not be in music, but in his collaborations with choreographers, most notably the brilliant Debbie Allen.  He represented a revolution in modern American dance not seen since Fosse and Tharp, and all with a competence that rivalled Charise, Astaire & Rogers, and Kelly.  (Please forgive me if I have mis-spelled some of the surnames of these greats).      In my opinion, his personal problems aside, Jackson the \\"mega-talent\\" deserved a better cinematic forum for a swan-song.      This is, essentially, a documentary shot in the style of a concert.  But no amount of glam and glitz can cover the fact that the enigmatic celebrity was in serious decline.  To me, he appeared rickety and ill, his voice enfeebled and incapable of the range once so effortless, and his dancing lacking in the serpentine, frenetic, sexual urgency that once made it so visually commanding.  It was, I thought, a picture of a man in serious physical trouble, a ghost of his former greatness.  And that is sad, sad indeed.  And for a documentary, the dearth of information about the comeback concert and the man himself was jarring.  Documentaries, I thought, aimed at delivery of information above all other things.  In this aspect, the film falls quite flat.  I came away knowing very little.         If one is available, I would purchase instead a video anthology of Jackson's video work from his salad days, when he soared at the height of his formidable abilities.  But not this.      Recommended only for the die-hard fan.  Otherwise, I would pass it up for a better offering.            ADDED NOTE:  I should disclose that I saw this in the theatre, and not in DVD format.  Sorry for the omission!

0060558121|3.0|The premise of the book is a good one, the witting and the pacing were very well done.  The characters, especially Shadow, are intricate and fully realized.  There are a few things I would have done differently, and I think this premise could have been taken a step further.  The old gods came over with immigrants; in their hearts and in their minds.  Odin is the focus, yet they come in all shapes and sizes. Personally, I was hoping he would go a different direction with this.  I would have liked to see something along the way of Whiskey Jack, something about \\"American Gods\\", that could capture that idea without falling to the cliche of TV and Capitalism, which this book did.  While I feel there was something missing, it was still an excellent read. 3 stars
0307387178|5.0|Into the Wild    Into the Wild is a story about a college kid named Christopher. Christopher is an outstanding student who graduates from Emory University  with honors and was one of the brightest in his class.  He gets sick of living the normal life however and  decides that he wants to take a break and plans to travel to the far west then up north to Alaska to live in the wild by himself. He donates all the money that he has received from is parents to a charity. He takes only the things he finds necessary to live off Nature.  He travels through various states of America in his car (which he left after it was caught in a flash flood) by train, hiking, canoeing and walking. He meets many people and enjoys many experiences on his exciting journey.     I really enjoyed this book because it was interesting reading about another kid's point of view around my age. Although I can't relate to chris' love for nature and the wild, I can see how he would enjoy living out there. He is a very Independent kid with a lot of pressure put on him from his parents to succeed. I recommend this book to everyone. It is a great read and the vocabulary is easy to understand.

0307266303|5.0|I enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.  I love fiction for a good story and non-fiction for the reality and facts.  Finding a book that does both is a gem and this one does that.  I loved it.  I love the outdoors and have been run for years as one of many ways to enjoy the outdoors, but this book has given me a new view of running and one that has already helped me enjoy running even more.  This is one of my lifetime top 10.  I wish all books were this good.
0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol is the follow-up to Dan Brown's blockbuster, The DaVinci Code. Coming on the heels of the movie version of Brown's Angels and Demons, it's little wonder so many readers have Robert Langdon on the brain nowadays. As in previous novels, Robert Langdon works \\"against the clock\\" to unravel a complex puzzle. There is symbology, history, science, architecture, and ancient brotherhoods aplenty. Brown fans will find this to be familiar territory. The locale is not exotic, but is set in Washington D.C., which in no way detracts from the story.<br /><br />What I like about Dan Brown novels is the fact that Brown infuses his story with mystery, and he knows how to peel back the layers of intrigue at a pace that titillates the reader without ever giving away too much at one time. The twists are few and unsurprising compared to Brown's previous works, but they are present, and add a little bit to the story. What I enjoyed the most about The Lost Symbol is that every time you think you've gotten to the \\"the big reveal\\", there's more. A few times toward the end of the book, I found myself noting the number of pages remaining, and wondered what story there was left to tell.<br /><br />The negatives of this novel are relatively few, but they are there. The pacing is much too slow in many places. The revelations at the end of the novel are too long and too preachy. I accidentally turned two pages at one point, and the same character was still talking. I didn't notice until several minutes later, and when I went back and read the pages I skipped, I discovered I really hadn't missed anything. Perhaps Mr. Brown has achieved enough clout that he is exempt from much editing. There are also some glaring continuity errors and errors in logic. In one scene, Langdon uses his cell phone to call the sister of an old friend on her own cellphone. Several pages later, the sister decides to make a dangerous trek to a different location so that she can look up Langdon's phone number, because she hasn't had it in years. Hello? Punch up 'Received Calls' on your cell phone?<br /><br />Overall, The Lost Symbol is exactly what one should expect from Dan Brown, so it's very much a matter of perspective. I personally would give it 3 1/2 stars if halves were possible. If you enjoy the measured pacing of a mystery/thriller with a rich historical subtext, you will love it. If you prefer the adrenaline-packed thrill ride of a Matthew Reilly novel, you will hate it. Read at your own risk.n't had it in years. Hello? Punch up 'Received Calls' on your cell phone?

B00026WUBE|4.0|I wish that I could give this album 4 1/2, but 4 will have to do. Planet Waves is a GREAT record musically and a very enjoyable listen, but I have just a couple of quibbles with it...    1) Some of the music is a little bit dated-- i.e. You Angel You and Something There Is About You-- which are both beautiful but have a distinctive 70s sound about them. For this reason, Planet Waves doesn't hold up as a timeless classic the way that Highway 61, Blonde On Blonde and Blood On The Tracks do.    2)  Someone already mentioned here that the songs are a bit forgettable. It's true that I listened to this album a few times before I even noticed \\"Never Say Goodbye,\\" maybe because the songs are generally shorter than typical and many of them have similar tempo.     3) The utilization of The Band could have been much better. They provide excellent backing for Bob, but aside from Robertson's prominent guitar work, they just don't shine like they could. I was hoping to hear some of Levon's powerful vocals, Garth's entrancing organ...but they're just not here. I realize that it's a Bob Dylan album, but considering the breadth of their collaborative efforts and The Band's own immense success as a group, you would think that they'd have been given a bigger creative role. Unless you are intimately familiar with their instrumental style, you may not even know that The Band was involved here.    I feel bad criticizing Planet Waves because I certainly don't want to discourage people from buying it. It's an upbeat, energy-filled, ROCKING album with some truly great and passionately sung songs-- Dirge, Wedding Song, Tough Mama, Hazel, and of course the unforgettable Forever Young (I like both versions, but the first is the classic version performed on The Last Waltz). Bob's voice is very melodic and expressive here and the music is strong. I just would have liked to have heard more of The Band because I'm such a big fan and I know that more of their input would have given this album the depth that it needs. They do and always have provided a solid bottom for Bob and they really get what his music is all about. The magic is here, but in my opinion, this album had the potential to be much more memorable and just slightly misses the mark.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has great talent and her CD is awesome. What a voice!!  I love all of the songs especially \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" and \\"Cry Me A River\\".  I have only one tini, tiny complaint ... I really loved the way the Monkees sang \\"Daydream Believer\\" and Susan's version was too slow.  I wanted to rock and roll and she didn't, I guess.  Anyway, I wish her great success in her singing career and I definitely will be buying her next CD.  I would love to see her live in concert.
B0021L8UPS|3.0|This film has a twist-ending that casts an eerie shadow back on the preceding events. However in order to get to this ending, we have to wade through a standard \\"bad seed\\" movie riddled with all the clichés, including mayhem in a tree-house. (Why is it that all psychopathic children seem to land in well-to-do families where elaborate, inviting tree-houses have been built for the family's other children?) So you wonder why you're sitting through this all again, when it seems to be just a re-play of films such as \\"The Good Son\\" - with only a change of gender to make any difference at all.    The writers should have found a way to introduce the twist in the middle of the movie - in such a way that we, the viewers, were in on the secret, while the characters in the movie were still in the dark. That would have made this film a truly chilling experience.    This is still worth watching though, if for no other reason than the glittering dark performance that Isabelle Fuhrman turns in as the adopted girl with the malevolent mind.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Julia Child, living in Paris and desperate to use her time wisely, decides to learn French cooking and write a book teaching it to Americans. Julia Powell, living in NYC a several decades later, reads Julia Child's book and put on daily recipes on her internet blog in 365 days. She is then offered to put all her recipes in a book and describe her journey with Julia Child's teachings.    This movie is quite interesting to watch even for those not much into cooking. Just the fact that it is based on two successful and true life stories is interesting in itself. The acting is breath taking.    Behind every great women there is a great man.
B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|Riverside has been on my musical horizon ever since the issue of Second Life Syndrome. Since that time, I have acquired and enjoyed all of their recordings to date. But for some reason, the special edition of Anno Domini High Definition has proven extremely elusive at what I consider to be a reasonable price for something that is newly released. First, I pre-ordered from amazon and months later, as the price steadily increased, I was informed that they were unable to obtain it. So I was forced to obtain it from a partner at nearly double the initially advertised price. That remains a sore point, but it does not impact my review of the quality of the music within.  On this album, the listener will find Riverside trending away from prog and deeper into metal. There are even a couple of tentative electric jazz excursions which add to the musical excitement. Here's what I like best: the great piano intro on Hyperactive; the intro on Driven to Destruction which to me evokes Al DiMeola's Electric Rendezvous; the driving, pounding, and very cerebral Egoist Hedonist; and the mellow beginnings of Left Out.  Buyers of this special edition also get a DVD which features the band live in Amsterdam in 2008 and a folded insert that features pictures and album info. Is it worth it? Well, stateside buyers may find it to be as getting this edition may be their only chance to enjoy Riverside live. I quite enjoyed it and found that it just about justified the price I paid. The studio CD is rather short and is available at a much lower price. But if you want a longer and louder sample of the band's music, you'll either have to knuckle under and pay the price now, or risk being faced with a much higher tariff in the future.

B0029358GM|5.0|I have listened to and enjoyed Wilco on and off for the past several years after being turned on to them by an old high school friend, but none of what I heard previously really prepared me for the glorious batch of songs that comprises Wilco (The Album). If this is not the best CD of 2009, it is certainly one of them!  There is not a bad song on the album and there is a diversity of styles that evokes some of the most creative writers in the music business. This album cements songwriter Jeff Tweedy in their league. On Wilco (the song) I hear echoes of Stephen Malkmus and his old band Pavement. On Deeper Down, Country Disappeared, and Everlasting Everything I sense the muse of Elvis Costello nodding approvingly, and on You Never Know I hear joyful echoes of George Harrison. But on my favorite cut, I'll Fight, I hear pure Jeff Tweedy.  Since there have been so many other reviews, most of them positive, I won't natter on. I just want to add my voice to the growing chorus that hears something special here. The CD comes with an attractive booklet that contains pictures, lyrics, and just minimal album information. If you want to know more, a note on the back page will guide you to the band's website. Get Wilco (The Album) as soon as possible so you can hear what you've been missing!
0385737947|4.0|The Maze Runner is a book about children caught in a sadistic rat maze. The story is compelling and sucks you in from the very beginning. There was never any time when I got bored with this book and when I turned the last page the first thing I did was look up James Dashner's website to see when book two was going to be out. The good news book two IS coming out, the bad news is that its not until October 2010. One of the only problem I had with this book was that Dashner tried too hard to make it a young adult novel. I know these are kids, but I can't see a 16 year old yelling \\"holy cow\\" when faced with a perilous situation. The other problem was that the solution to the Maze (which I won't mention) seemed to simple for the story. I felt like the characters should have figured it out much sooner, but the rest of the story overshadows this small problem and kept me turning the pages to see what happens next.    Overall I thought it was an excellent book and I can't wait until Book 2 comes out in October.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|The packaging of the CD is not just regular, it's in a small booklet, truly great for the legacy he left behind!
3442217784|5.0|I am a person who has been self taught after my high school years and some college. With that said, this book is not for everyone. It is an extremely counter intuitive book. This type of thinking is not taught in school since it points you in the direction to climb the mountain. Traditional education tells you what mountain to climb, what gear to buy, what day to climb the mountain, etc. Think of it like religion. You may choose which path to take, but it may not get you to where you want to go. That is up to you. This book tells you absolutely nothing, but tells you everything. Maybe a better analogy would have been philosophy. This book will not tell you how to get rich step by step. That is content and shows you a step by step way or strategies to get rich. This tells you how to think different and has a way of changing the context of the subject of making money. For example, if I say \\" I\\"m going to make money\\". That would be a contextualized statement and some assumptions would be created, like getting a job. Now, if i said \\" I am going to make money illegally\\". Whoa....wait a minute, that changes everything. I am still making money but the context changes. The two statements do not mean the same thing and open a whole different perception of making money. That is what this book is about, which may sound confusing. At this moment in time, buying homes is not the correct investment vehicle. That \\"bubble\\" has burst and still will take time to deflate. Now is the time to invest in Gold & Silver, another Rich Dad Poor Dad book. If you want to learn about money, then read all the Rich Dad, Poor Dad books, then read them again. Also, watch CNBC when you can along with \\"Fox Business Network\\". Finally, [...] and watch Peter Schiff and Jim Rogers and you will be well on the way to \\"making money\\" and will learn about \\"bubbles\\" like I did. Hopefully, you will not make the same mistakes that I did, but making mistakes is a process of learning. Be careful, the dollar is falling steadily and now Dubai is in trouble. We can't keep printing money or inflation, or hyperinflation will ruin all of our wealth. Good Luck.
0143144456|1.0|I picked this audio CD up because the back of it said \\"IF I STAY is a heartachingly beautiful book about the power of love, the true meaning of family, and the choices we all make\\"<br /><br />Pretty powerful sounding correct? It wasnt. This is a book about a 17 year old girl named Mia, whose parents are former punk rockers that allow thier child to drink beer, and whose outlook on life is decidedly liberal, feminist, and ultra laid back. Mia and her family, which includes her little brother Teddy are in a car accident and Mia \\"wakes up\\" in the road only to find she is looking at her parents dead, and herself injured enough to get a helicopter ride to the hospital. A big rip off of [[ASIN:0316001821 The Lovely Bones: Deluxe Edition]] but without it being clever, intellegent and riveting.<br /><br />We are supposed to care about Mia, and her boyfriend the cool musician adam, and her best friend Kim who \\"of course\\" hated her at first. We are supposed to listen to Mia watch herself and her family at the hospital, and flash back into the past and remember how awesome her life was. We are supposed to care, but instead we are wondering \\"where is the substance?\\" Its clear the \\"choices we all make\\" is just one choice that Mia has to make. Stay on earth or go to heaven, or whatever her liberal parents told her souls go to when they die. Oh its so hard for Mia to decide, and we are forced into a situation where we are supposed to give a rip, I didnt. I seriously didnt understand the whole point of it all. True love brings you back? Family is what you make it? It rains alot in Seattle? Bah.<br /><br />Bottom line, its an after school special that I would recommend you skip.

0716703440|1.0|I am a retired EE professor, interested in learning something about general relativity in order to apply it to the foundations of electromagnetic field theory.<br /><br />Frankly, this book reads like a series of powerpoint slides in a presentation in support of a grant application.<br /><br />There is very little of rigor here.  The basic concept of a tensor is given a very glossy treatment.  \\"A tensor is a machine that accepts a vector here, and a one-form there, and grinds out---\\"<br /><br />I have no problem with colorful language, but these authors never really progress beyond that, treating their topic without any semblance of rigor in a mathematical sense.<br /><br />I felt that my dollars spent on this book were wasted.

1601251505|5.0|Like many long-time Dungeons & Dragons players, I was shocked and upset with the way Wizards of the Coast handled the transition to 4th edition.  Reading information posted by WotC personnel on their message boards, their intent was clear:  push out the \\"old guard\\"--the already-established D&D gamers--and make the game more attractive to today's crop of video-game RPG players and World of Warcraft lovers.  I've been playing D&D for over 15 years; I welcomed the update from 2nd edition to 3rd edition, so I'm not some old fuddy-duddy who cannot accept change.  But the way the switch from 3.5 to 4th was handled was terrible.<br /><br />Along came Pathfinder RPG--the savior of the world's most popular role-playing game.  I can still use every single one of my massive collection of 3rd/3.5 edition rulebooks for D&D with it, and all I need to do are a few minor tweaks.  The rules have been somewhat streamlined (grapple, I'm looking at you!), the core classes have been rebalanced, and a fresh dose of fun has been injected to the game.<br /><br />The PRPG Core Rulebook is just that--everything you need to get started except for monsters.  It is a Player's Handbook and Gamemaster's Guide combined into one hefty, beautiful hardcover.  In addition, you can get a bunch of free monsters off of [...] to get you started, or purchase the PRPG Bestiary.<br /><br />All in all, as a long-time gamer and a lover of the world's most popular role-playing game, the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook is the best thing to happen to the game in a long time.  Try it and see!
B0026P3G12|3.0|This is a pleasant album to listen to, and I love her voice. I really like some of the songs, especially \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\" I have trouble, though, knowing what this album is supposed to be. I think the addition of \\"How Great Thou Art\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" (two of my favorite songs, by the way) was a mistake, as they don't fit in with this album AT ALL. (To go from \\"Cry me a River\\" to \\"How Great Thou Art\\" is just plain odd.) And while I love the song \\"Silent Night,\\" just because this album was released at Christmas time does not make it a Christmas album, and this song should not have been included. If it weren't for the strange combination of songs, I would have given her 5 stars instead of 3.    Keep on singing, Susan!  I'd like to hear more! (Just make the songs fit together next time!)
B000000Y2F|5.0|Yes it's me again, and this is one of the 20 I am keeping as I begin giving my vinyl to the young'uns.     I'm obviously not alone in my estimate of this recording. So I won't re-hash so much of what has been said except to add that \\"Nutty\\", \\"Epistrophy\\" and \\"Trinkle Tinkle\\" are so unique and powerful that, if recorded today, they would generate the same level of admiration and controversy. Monk remains one of the most polarizing musicians in any genre. From my first hearing (the Paris solo disc from the mid-50's) I loved his music, and I believe his uncompromising vision and delivery helped Coltrane recognize his full potential. For me, this is one of very few recordings that summarize 'jazz': it's a little rough around the edges; almost incredibly facile musical communication; unapologetic in the certainty of the players' musical statements; and great fun to listen to. It's playing now, and while I've listended to it probably hundreds of times, it still sounds fresh and amazing.    If you like Monk and/or Coltrane, you will enjoy this a lot (and the Carnegie recording is fine too!). If you like one but not the other, give it a listen - their differences work together well, and while Coltrane dominates a bit, it's Monk's music that provides the framework. If you don't like either or aren't sure, check out the YouTube clips and you will quickly know. Enjoy!
B0013FBS20|3.0|I have never read the novels before so I can't compare the movie to them.  When I first saw the trailers, I was genuinely excited to watch this movie.  This review is based strictly on my own personal opinion regarding the movie.<br /><br />I thought the concept behind the story was cool.  A scientist claims she has found the cure for cancer, but a few years later, pretty much everyone is either dead or has become some type of creature that lives in the dark and apparently feeds on flesh and blood.  Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist who is living in NYC while trying to find a cure for this disease.  His only companion is his dog Sam.  Their relationship kind of reminds me of Tom Hanks and Wilson from the movie Castaway.  It shows how difficult it is to live in isolation without any other form of human contact.  But as far as the story goes, that's pretty much the gist of it.<br /><br />They also should have used real actors and actresses to play the creatures.  Sometimes I feel like movies have fallen in love with CGI way too much.  Honestly, the creatures look fake to me.  They just don't look real at all for some reason.  There were also parts of the movie that were just unnecessary (the scene where he goes to \\"rent\\" movies).  I mean, I understand they're trying to show how he needs contact with other humans, but did we really need to see that scene?  And why did he go back in there after the incident with Sam later on in the movie?  Totally unnecessary in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, it was an OK movie.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either.  If you're a Will Smith fan, I'd say go check it out and see what it's about for yourself.
B001I8BN7C|5.0|This is my first time reading Stephen King and I can honestly say that I was very impressed. This story is about a 9 year od girl named Tricia who gets lost in the woods for nine days.<br /><br />I was drawn into this story very quickly and as strange as this may sound; I became attached to Tricia and found myself not wanting to put the book down because I didn't want to 'leave her', lol. I also cringed when she was sick, shuddered when she ate a raw fish and was so proud of her when her survival instincts kicked in. It was an amazing story of perserverance and survival and I just loved it. Even though this wasn't 'horror' per sae, I still felt fear for her in the sense that this could really happen and the building fear that something was tracking her in the woods...waiting.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that for a 9 year old she uses some pretty strong language( I guess I would too under the same circumstances, though). Excellent read, well worth 5 stars in my opinion!
0061854549|5.0|This was a fascinating look into human behavior.  Each case was backed-up with scientific experiments that were well presented and easy reading.  The author also had reasonable suggestions on how to use the information.

B001FXCE46|5.0|Don't listen to anyone complain about how this album is awful compared to the previous two. If people say that, they're likely to be musical snobs who dissect everything until they find something wrong. I'm sorry, but if you liked Kings of Leon before, you'll like this album, too. Personally, I think Aha Shake Heartbreak is still their best, but don't rag on a band for trying something new without getting rid of their unique sound. Aha Shake was more solid and upbeat than Youth and Young Manhood, it was a change for the better, obviously, and they found their sound. Because of the Times was generally a bit darker and grungier than Aha Shake--they were trying something new, and still produced GREAT results. Only by the Night is no different--it's an attempt at something new for the band--so don't rag on them just because it brought them success.    THINK about it--they recorded this stuff, and THEN they started getting huge (in the US) because of it. It's not their fault so many people started liking them AFTER this album came out. So quit being snobs and follow the music like a fan, jackholes.    THIS BAND WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU LISTEN TO ROCK MUSIC, no matter which album you buy, (okay, except perhaps their first, Youth and Young Manhood...which I still give a solid 4 stars).
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's is an inspiring modern Cinderella story.  It reminds us that anybody has a chance if only you are willing, has enough courage, and the right amount hunger to get what you dreamed of.  Overall, this is a monster debut from the woman who Simon Cowell was almost  ready to dished out when he saw her walking toward the center of the stage.  Everybody thought she was joking.  But what happened that night was the biggest surprised of all.  Susan Boyle brought the house down.  Everyone was shocked and to their feet giving one of the longest applause in the history of the talent show .<br /><br />Currently, she is already on track for the biggest debut of 2009 according to Billboard.<br /><br />  1. Wild Horses - I like this kind of songs when I am in a lounge sipping wine.  Relaxing.<br /><br />  2. I Dreamed A Dream - This was the song where it all began.  This is the song that brought tears to millions of people who watched her on their televisions and YouTubes.  It really shows the power in her voice.<br /><br />  3. Cry Me A River  - Perfect for candlelight dinners<br /><br />  4. How Great Thou Art -  Imagine this resonating to the walls of a large auditorium.<br /><br />  5. You'll See - Shows you that her voice is a perfect suit for broadway musicals like Cats, Les Miserables, etc.<br /><br />  6. Daydream Believer -  Welcomed version of a classic hit by The Monkees<br /><br />  7. Up To The Mountain - Not much to say about this one.<br /><br />  8. Amazing Grace - I sometimes say, too many versions of a song can be irritating.  But she made me changed my mind .<br /><br />  9. Who I Was Born To Be - It is like the story of her life.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I have been a fan of Coldplay since I first heard the song \\"Clocks.\\" I was immediately attracted to the unique style that this English band offers. In today's technologically advanced society, it is not difficult to maintain success worldwide. The difficulty is found, instead, in attaining the fame. Coldplay has been able to not only gain worldwide fame, but also maintain it for many years. With all of the styles and genres that today's music has to offer, Coldplay continues to impress listeners around the world with a consistent sound. \\"Viva La Vida\\" packages that unique sound while adding new, creative twists to the music that many know and love.  I received \\"Viva La Vida\\" as a gift the day that it was released in the United States. I have been very pleased with it. I own all of Coldplay's albums and will not hesitate in saying that this is my favorite thus far. I was fortunate to go to Coldplay's \\"Viva La Vida\\" Nashville concert in June. This was the first time I had seen the band perform live. It was a wonderful experience. Coldplay's album not only depicts an honest sound, but they are also able to entertain during a concert better than any other band that I have seen. My husband is not a Coldplay fan, but he tells everyone that their concert is the best he has been to.   I appreciate Coldplay for all of these reasons and many more. Their lyrics are simple, their sound is unique, and their message is real. I expect they will continue to succeed in years to come.    -Ericka Blackwell

B002VECM40|4.0|Rarely does a film come along with such convicing, raw power as \\"Precious\\" has at its disposal. It is not suited for children by any means, but those avoiding the film because of its graphic violence and the grim realities it depicts are doing themselves a disservice. Is this escapism? Certainly not. The performances by Gabourney Sidibe and Mo'Nique are so stirring, so emotionally resonant, that they linger over your memory and refuse to leave it. Never since Angela Lansbury's scheming, positively evil mother in \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" has there been a more frightening female supporting character in an American drama film than Mo'Nique's turn as Precious' bitter, beyond-the-borderline mother Mary. The foreboding presence and resulting despair she brings to \\"Precious\\" is positively gut-wrenching and horrifying. It is a performance for the ages that absolutely must win the Oscar if the integrity of the film academy is to be maintained. Paula Patton and Mariah Carey also put in stark, genuine turns as women invested in helping turn Precious' life around. To accomplish this, though, Precious must first believe in herself, her dreams and her future, with or without the light-skinned boy she fantasizes about to escape the pain of day-to-day life. Lee Daniels' direction is a little uneven and jarringly paced, but his ability to capture such moving performances and linger over the most crucial scenes gives \\"Precious\\" the added depth and dimension it needs to reach the level of greatness. This is hands down the best American drama film of 2009 and a surefire contender for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|The BU-353 worked nicely with my old Pentium Toshiba laptop.  I use it with the OziExplorer navigation program and the GPS identified as a NMEA0183 \\"other\\" type GPS receiver.    The unit seems to be accurate to within 10 feet and does all I could expect.  Just have to remember that it is only a receiver with no memory for waypoints, tracks, routes or the other things that a full up GPS navigation unit normally has.  Of course that is why it is small and inexpensive.  Use your laptop and a program and you have a full navigation unit.

159102594X|5.0|My first 5 star rating on amazon.  I read this series immediately following the brand new WOT novel: the gathering storm, a book i had been looking forward to for 4 years, and a series I have followed since the beginning some fifteen years ago.  I figured nothing could match it and almost felt bad reading anything so soon.  But.  This book and the following two, in my opinion, blew away the WOT novel.     This is sharp witted dark fantasy at its best.  An engrossing story set in a believable world with a backdrop of war and politics, shown in all their dark glory (or is it gory).  The author holds nothing back in terms of blood and death.  Be assured, this is not for the faint of heart.  It is the characters that truly drive the story, and are the greatest achievement of the series, for they are, to me the most fascinating group I have ever come across. They begin interesting and grow on you throughout the books, sometimes not in the way you might imagine, and sometimes not for the better.  All finish in places you may or may not suspect, but very believably.    If you like your characters and stories black and white this is not for you.  If, however, you see the world in shades of gray and appreciate the view, you will appreciate this series.  If you believe 'good' and 'evil' are terms that depend on perspective, and that history is written by the winners, you will love this series.  Sometimes villians can end as heroes and sometimes heroes end as villians, but most of the time we all are a little of both. You have to be realistic about these things.    I would add that some of the details in the world building were skimmed over.  The magic system could have been fleshed out.  But for me, the story was so entertaining and the characters so fascinating, I'm completely ignoring these negatives and giving this one a 5/5.

B0006IIPIK|5.0|Five stars? 500 would not be enough to symbolize how emphatically, mind-dazzlingly, awe-inspiring this film is. The title of this review is the simplest way to say it, without joking, hyperbole, or even the slightest bit of irony. In the utter blackness of modern cinema, this one shines like a supernova. I will not rehash the plot, but devote the space I'm allotted to attempting to communicate (as if mere words could do it justice) just WHY this film is so great.    #1: While true to itself, it doesn't take itself too seriously.   What kills 99.9% of all movies made is their over-bearing, self-regarding self-importance. Movies are not status symbols or intellectual capital, but entertainment. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is first and last unadultrated, unabashed FUN. You are not a better or smarter person for having seen it and enjoyed it.    #2: It creates its own world/universe.  While ostensibly taking place in the year 1939, no efforts are made to be \\"real\\" and actual people/events from that year are mostly ignored. With its own logic and \\"top secret\\" technologies, nit-pickers will be greatly offended, but are advised to re-read reason #1.    #3: It breaks the rules of action/adventure/sci-fi movies.  Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is the slow unveiling of a mystery. The reason why this movie was not the runaway hit it should have been is that contemporary movie audiences only want good-guys vs. bad-guys battles. Any kind of ambiguity involves way too much thinking, and it's much easier to wait for cliches like a James Bond-type villain who says, \\"Before I kill you, allow me to give you a tour of my installation.\\"    #4: The writing/direction dares to be different.  Based solely on this movie, I consider Kerry Conran to be the greatest writer/director EVER. Without the expectation baggage of a pre-existing audience like the comic-book movies, Conran is able to tell what is really a very simple story in a highly imaginative way. He shows his viewers just enough to pique their interest and sustain mystery, moves quickly from scene to scene, and provides plausible solutions for the challenges his characters are faced with.    #5: The in-jokes.  In a fast-paced film such as this, most viewers will miss these, but for those who find them, they are an absolute delight. Some are revealed in this DVD's commentaries, and others have been uncovered in online fan-discussions. This is absolutely an uncynical movie.    #6: It's a tribute to classic Hollywood.  This is Conran's love letter to the days before film-making became a pompous, self-congratulatory enterprise. Dozens of films are referenced from the early action/adventure/sci-fi classics, to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", to the \\"Star Wars\\"/\\"Indiana Jones\\" series, even to the point of quoting a line from \\"Galaxy Quest\\".     #7: The \\"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\\" factor.  After earning the financial backing and support of a major studio (credit: Paramount Pictures), Conran throws EVERYTHING imaginable into this movie, knowing full well he might never have another chance (almost prophetic, considering he has yet to make his next film). There is an absolutely daring \\"let's go for it - hold nothing back\\" ethos that pervades the entire project, even though like all film-makers, he ran out of time and money as deadlines loomed.    #8: The CGI.  Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow generated quite a buzz when first released for being almost entirely shot in front of a blue screen. While today's technology has no doubt left these efforts in the dust, what they did with a beginner's budget is downright amazing and laid the groundwork for what movies can do today.    #9: The actors and their performances.  Jude Law: best leading actor EVER. Gwyneth Paltrow: best leading actress EVER. Laurence Olivier: best resurrected actor EVER. Giovanni Ribisi: best supporting actor EVER. Angelina Jolie: best cameo EVER (she only appears on-screen for 10 minutes). For a relatively small cast,this ensemble shines like no other, creating loveable, unique characters who could easily have been sustained over a continuing series (alas...). Exhibiting a range that extends from serious to silly, the viewer can actually care about these characters.    #10: The score.  I would like to nominate Edward Shearmur's awesome score as the greatest EVER written. Clearly inspired by the classic Hollywood composers such as Korngold, Rozsa, John Williams, and even the military soundtracks of Malcolm Arnold, it was hearing this score in the theatre that convinced me this was no mere popcorn flick. And using a new version of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" (credit: Jane Monheit) over the closing credits is sheer genius, as this song sums up in 4 minutes what the whole project is all about: hopes/wishes/dreams becoming reality.    #11: It's beautiful!  If you love the Art Deco/Streamline Moderne movements in design and architecture, you've found the ultimate movie. From lighting to color to costumes to set-pieces to ship design, everything is perfect! Space does not permit a complete listing of breathtaking moments, but Polly's (Paltrow) entrance into Radio City Music Hall, Joe's (Law) walking across the Flying Legion emblem at headquarters before arriving at his office, the interior of Totenkopf's rocket, and the climactic \\"back to earth\\" scene are some of the greatest pieces of footage ever filmed/created.    I will stop at 11 (Einheit Elf?). This movie should have been the next \\"Star Wars\\" but it flew completely over the heads of its intended audience. Yes it has a cult following and will probably be re-discovered and re-analyzed at some future date, but it was plainly too damn good for the world of 2004 and the elitest reviewers who buried this diamond in the cinema dungheap. For as long as I walk this earth, I will hold on to hope for a sequel/prequel/ANYTHING from the brilliant team that made Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, the greatest movie ever made.

B00164CM46|5.0|Buy this movie, don't wait.<br /><br />That aside, one of the coolest features of the Blu Ray version here are the \\"Pikey\\" subtitles.  Finally, almost all of the gibberish from Brad and the lads has been translated.  Almost.  The most famous of the Pikey scenes, during the dogs and hare race, is not fully subtitled.  Lemme help:  \\"Now look, she wants the Heki 2-roof lights, side by side french furniture and the scarlet cushions with the matching hatchback covers. Oh and boys, she's terrible partial to the periwinkle blue.\\"<br /><br />Buy this movie.  Don't wait.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Of course this is awesome! I was fourteen when I saw Star Wars when it was first introduced in 1977 and it is still a wonderful movie. I love the new special effects, I think this is what George Lucas orignally wanted to do with the movies but the technology hadn't been invented yet (boy I'm dating myself here). Enjoy!
B001QOGYB8|5.0|This is a rare family friendly movie that feels like an independent film.  I love the humor and the clever story, which will draw comparisons to \\"[[ASIN:B00003CXJ4 Chicken Run]]\\", but is original all on it's own.  The vocal performances are great, but the real highlight is the stop-motion animation.  One of the best films to juggle being entertaining and smart for adult audiences, while remaining 99% kid-friendly.  This would be the best animated film of the year if it weren't for \\"[[ASIN:B001KVZ6G6 Up (4 Disc Combo Pack with Digital Copy and DVD) [Blu-ray]]]\\" - but it's pretty darn close!

B001FB562U|4.0|[[ASIN:0307476308 The Road (Movie Tie-in Edition 2009) (Vintage International)]] is one of my favorite books, so I was nervous about the adaptation to the screen.  Fortunately, the film respected it's source material and contains one powerful visual after the next.  The film is perfectly cast, very well acted, and adequately written.  When you have such a descriptive book as \\"The Road\\", it's hard to capture everything - and the film does a good job but doesn't completely succeed.  Without spoiling the ending, I will just say I think the emotional sting the book leaves is better than the film.  This is also such a dark film I think those not familiar with the source material might find it too dark and depressing.  It's certainly not for everyone, but for fans of the book, it's a nice companion.
044661758X|5.0|I just recently started reading Michael Connelly and I am so glad I did.  If you like Jonathan Kellerman and/or John Sanford, you'll like Connelly.  I'm reading his books in order which I think was the right way to go since they seem to build off of one another.  Harry Bosch, an LAPD Detective and the primary character in the book, really grows on you after several books.  Concrete Blonde is skillfully written and Connelly sets up several suspects as viable candids for being the killer.  I'm usually pretty good at figuring out \\"whodunit\\", but Connelly got me on this one.
B001FB55HQ|1.0|If you want to watch a great movie where things blow up, watch \\"Transformers\\" as at least it's more colorful and exciting.<br />If you want to watch a great Christian Bale movie, watch \\"The Dark Knight\\" or \\"Batman Begins.\\"<br />If you want to watch a great robot movie, watch \\"Wall*E.\\"<br />If you want to watch a great Terminator movie, watch one of the first two.<br /><br />This lousy excuse for an action film fails in every way, creating a \\"story\\" that is solely meant to cash in on the word \\"Terminator.\\"  Watching it feels like being stuck watching someone you don't like playing a video game that you don't like.  I wouldn't take this movie if they offered it for free.  If you're a die-hard fan of the original series, you will be extremely let down, but fortunate to not have paid money to see this in theaters (like I did.)  You can disagree with me if you'd like, but if you do, you obviously would not have seen many other action movies and certainly never have seen the original two films.  Even the short-lived FOX television show was better.<br /><br />You've been warned.
0446613444|5.0|I recently decided to read Michael Connelly and I am really enjoying his books.  Black Ice is my second Connelly book given I've decided to read them in order.  What I loved about Black Echo and now Black Ice is how intricate and well thought through the plots are.  In Black Ice, Harry Bosch aggressively investigates the deaths of two fellow officers even though his superiors would prefer he leave things alone.  His investigation takes him to Mexico and it is interesting how Connelly depicts law enforcement south of the border.  Like in most murder mysteries, Harry eventually gets his man but you might be suprised by who that man turns out to be...I was!

B00003CWRX|5.0|Well, it's official. Michael Mann has now become one of my favorite directors. He has directed three of my favorite films: Heat, The Insider, & Collateral. Although I'm bit more for the styles of Stanley Kubrick & Tim Burton, I still admire Mann's own. His way of bringing realistic drama into his own films is a very intriguing (not to mention satisfying) experience. The flow, the realistic environments, and the refreshingly adult content that surrounds his motion pictures is something that should be fully understood especially in today's cinema. Almost every scene is an example of visual poetry: the shootout in Heat, the coyote in Collateral, the waterfall in The Last of the Mohicans, etc. The man really knows how to make a great film, and The Insider is proof of that. Made ten years ago by Touchstone, this political thriller deals with two subjects: the tobacco industry and the media. However, this doesn't move like an action adventure, complete with Colt Commandos and car chases and governmental technology. No, this moves like a Nelson DeMille thriller. It's all about dialogue, character development, and lack of glorification of any sort. This is a compelling human drama that never succumbs to melodramatic overtones.<br /><br />The movie is based on the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (played brilliantly by Russell Crowe), who at the time was Vice President for a tobacco company called Brown & Williamson. He has been terminated from his job, and \\"60 Minutes\\" producer Lowell Bergman (played amazingly by Al Pacino) suspects that this has to do with the whistleblower policy. The two eventually meet and Wigand explains to Bergman why he was fired. This becomes an official story for \\"60 Minutes,\\" while it leads to Wigand into a courtroom where he tells the truth about Brown & Williamson. This is only the beginning. The tobacco industry starts to fight back at Wigand and \\"60 Minutes,\\" and it's only a matter of chance that our two heroes will succeed in telling the truth.<br /><br />As I said before, Crowe and Pacino are absolutely excellent here. While not exactly looking similar to the real Wigand and Bergman, it looks like they've got the personas down to a T. The supporting cast is close to perfection. Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall, Diane Venora, Colm Feore, Gina Gershon, Michael Gambon, and Bruce McGill give wonderful performances. I especially love McGill's rant during the courtroom scene: that REALLY shut his opponent up, didn't it? But I think the best thing about this movie is the script. There is solid dialogue throughout, and it really sounds like how real people would say things. Eric Roth and Michael Mann should be given props for this screenwriting. It's a shame they didn't win an Oscar, though.<br /><br />You know, I could go on praising this film even more, but Amazon has its limits when it comes to customer reviews. So I'll just finish by saying that this is a deeply powerful film about the tobacco industry and the media. It's a film that makes you think, makes you see through harsh reality, makes you want to see more from Mann, Pacino, and Crowe. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I think you will, too.<br /><br />Grade: Aaid before, Crowe and Pacino are absolutely excellent here.

B001NESPHC|5.0|Be prepared to fall in love-if not with the one you're with, then with the music, lyrics, beauty and magical performance of Melody Gardot. If ever a CD was made to be played in a candle lit room and accompanied with sipping wine by the fireplace, this is it.<br /><br />For the most part the lyrics and melodies are her own. Gardot's ability to make you a part of her moment and feel the emotion of the music comes off without a hitch. Her voice, the musical accompanyment, the pace and overall sound quality are excellent.<br /><br />Three months ago I had never heard of Melody Gardot. Since then I am among her most ardent fans-mostly because of this CD. The magic of this album incorporates Melody Gardot's fantastic pipes, outstanding musical accompanyment and arrangements that really work. Gardot is a jazz singer who is making her mark internationally. If someone hasn't nominated \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" for a Grammy- they certainly should.

I did so- Pat was nice and all and since I had some time to kill- I sat down and started reading.    1st of all, I am a HUGE fantasy novel reader- You name it- I've read it. Tad Williams, George R. R. Martin, Eddings, blablablah... So without knowing much about this author- I truly didn't think that a guy from central Wisconsin, from where I lived- could write a book that was up to my standards.    But I was wrong... I am not that far into the book- finals are here and I've no time for sleeping much less pleasure reading. But I can tell that this is going to be a great book. It has this turning and twisting play on words- creative sentence structures, nothing blathering or boring. I can't wait to have an afternoon free so I can keep turning the pages. A lot of fantasy novels these days seem to be reaping on \\"what works well\\" in older, more famous series and titles. This one just FEELS newer and creative with more twists while still sticking to the classic fantasy world that I wish I could live in every day of my life since I was in 5th grade.    Lets just say that my friend MIGHT not get her signed copy when she comes to claim it from me in a couple weeks...

0439023483|5.0|Amazon Book Review  Trey, Trent, Ryan  11/18/09  Hunger Games    Author Suzanne Collins is the writer of the acclaimed bestselling Underland Chronicles. In one of her more recent books, The Hunger Games, she continues to explore war and adventure.  The Hunger Games is a terrific work of literature that is set in a post-apocalyptic North America known as the country Panem. The Protagonist is a sixteen year old girl by the name of Katniss Everdeen. She lives in District 12 better known as the Seams. Katniss is a huntress that loves to do what she does. Her mother is a single parent who seemed to give up on life after her husband, Katniss's father, passed due to a coal mining accident. Her little sister Primrose, age 12, adores Katniss and the feeling is mutual from Katniss's eyes. Katniss protects her family and takes care of them as if she is the \\"man of the house\\" since her mother has become dreary. Katniss hunts with her best friend Gale who is also a great hunter. They claim their caught game and trade it the black market referred to as the Hob. These skills come in handy when Katniss is entered into the Games.    The actual Hunger Games were a sign of punishment created to remind all citizens of the past rebellion. Originally there were 13 districts; all thirteen rebelled against the Capitol of Panem. The Capitol retaliated by destroying District 13 and creating the Hunger Games. In the games, there are twenty-four contestants two from each district who fight to the death to be victorious with glory, fame, and fortune. Prim is chosen but Katniss volunteers in her place leaving Katniss and Peeta Melark chosen from District 12 to participate in the Hunger Games. Both go through a lot of fierce competition but befriend one another. Soon they become closer and this piece of literature adds a little romance to its violence. The Hunger Games is a book that is very enjoyable to read and also one that keeps the reader on their toes.     \\"Winning means everything. Losingmeans certain death. The Hunger Games have begun...\\"
B000GDH9AA|2.0|The audio quality of this product is mediocre.  I am assuming that the problem is in the recording phase. Either that or this is a pirated copy made with inferior recording equipment.  The main problem seems to be the very limited dynamic range as if a lot of compression was used to record it.  I find it hard to believe that a professional recording made at a live concert can have this poor quality sound.

B002H3F7F6|3.0|I found this music classical and based in Old Religous Latin church music.  Yes there is one good song on the album, but I was very disappointed since this was the first Sting CD I had bought.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|First only lending a ear and not paying close attention to the album, I said to myself : \\"well, not as inspired as prevouis ones\\". But how wrong I was, when I really started giving it the attention the album deserves.    MK's music is as classy, subtle, accurate as ever, and his words always inspiring and full of imagery. It can but touch your soul.    If one had to define GET LUCKY, one could say that it has quiet a strong Irish/Scottish Flavour. See for exemple the great up tempo 1st single \\"Border Reiver\\", the tasteful \\"Before Gas and TV\\" set in days of yore, the emotional and excellent piece of writing that's \\"So Far From The Clyde\\", and the closer \\"Piper to the End\\", an hommage to MK's oncle Freddie who died a piper in the British army in France, during WWI.     Then you have what I would call the great, great, great folk songs such as \\"Get Lucky\\" and its exquisite flute, or else the wondrous 2nd single \\"Remembrance Day\\", sung with a children choir made up of some of the musicians', studio techs and staff's children and wives, among which Isabella et Katya Knopfler, MK's daughters and their mother Kitty (Aldridge) Knopfler.     The rest is inspired by a kind of 60's rock, tainted with accents of blues and Honky Tonk : \\"You Can't Beat The House\\" (mu only skipper), \\"Cleaning My Gun\\" (reminding a bit of an old DIRE STRAITS' classic called HEAVY FUEL), \\"The Car was the One\\".     To finish, I'd like to comment upon 2 surprising titles which are just great too :   \\"Hard Shoulder\\", which sounds like a cruise ship song with French horns and strings.  \\"Monteleone\\", a Waltz Disney kind of waltz paying tribute to American guitar builder, John Monteleone, which is a perfect choice for wintery evenings at the light and heat of the mantelpiece.     Just one last very personal thing about the Get Lucky album :   Here I'm giving you my own perfect playlist, including one or two previously unreleased tracks, and removing others.  Do what you please of it...    1/ BORDER REIVER(1st single)    2/ HARD SHOULDER    3/ HOME BOY (I LOVE IT!!!! PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED AND AVAILABLE IN THE GET LUCKY BOX SET)    4/ EARLY BIRD (edited) (I LOVE IT!!!!) - Could have been a fantastic single! YOU LUCKY AMERICANS CAN GET IT THROUGH AMAZON.COM    5/ BEFORE GAS AND TV    6/ MONTELEONE (WHAT A TREAT!!!)    7/ CLEANING MY GUN (Third possible single)    8/ REMEMBRANCE DAY (JUST PERFECT!!! - Second single)    9/ GET LUCKY (Fourth possible single - already used a lot on the radio)    10/ SO FAR FROM THE CLYDE (THIIISSSSS! IS A PIECE OF STORY TELLING!!!)    11/ PIPER TO THE END
B002NOYX54|5.0|This group is amazing! Read the history first and you will love it. I am hooked!
B00127RAJY|4.0|The video starts off with Jillian stating that she has heard that she is one of the toughest trainers around,....and she admits that's probably true - AGREED.  Jillian is no joke!  If i could I would hire her to be my personal trainer. This DVD is the next best thing.  I picked this up after getting hooked on TBL (The Biggest Loser)and seeing how tough and real she is as a trainer.  She doesn't allow any excuses when she's training you and she will push you; that's a given!  There are 3 levels on this DVD. The first level is challenging if your not in shape; because she doesn't allow ANY resting between the exercises. The DVD is essentially circuit training, going from one exercise to the next and then back again in a cycle WITHOUT rest!  I would definitely recommend this to anybody.  It's a great workout!
B0026P3G12|5.0|With my Kplisch giant floor speakers all I can say is......WOW!!  This CD is awesome and magnificent.  The song assortment is absolute perfection.  I truly enjoyed every single song.  Susan is truly a gift to the world.  This CD would make a great gift for anyone.  And the price is super!  Very happy with this purchase.
B002T9H2LK|1.0|I like war movies, but this was rubbish. With the talent behind this movie they could have done a much better job.  There are SO many great stories to be told out there, why o why do they make such drivel??  Who decides which stories to tell, are these people nuts, bored or just ignorant?
1439102813|5.0|This was an excellent book, fast read, very informative and have several friends waiting to read it.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|I applaud Sting's exploration of music from centuries past.  My problem with this album (and Songs from the Labyrinth) is twofold:  firstly, the recording of each breath he takes is distracting and, secondly, his slurred enunciation of the lyrics.  Intuitively, we can all be pretty confident that troubadours of old thought their lyrics important to the song and would have taken some pains to sing them clearly.  In days of yore, the listener did not have liner notes to reference when s/he could not understand a word or phrase.  I wish Sting would pay attention to this detail, for I believe his inattention to it takes a lot of pleasure away from these recordings.
B00000K31Q|4.0|I bought this movie for my sister for her birthday; it's one of her favorites.  I happen to like it as well.  It makes a great gift because the DVDs are often harder to find in stores now that the movie is older.  Also, they are easy to buy used but in good condition.  It's a funny and entertaining movie, a spin off of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun movie, especially teens.
0060558121|5.0|American Gods was my introduction to Neil Gaiman. I'd heard my friends go on and on about how great he was for this or that, and never thought too much of it because I had other things waiting in my \\"To Read\\" pile. But one day, I ran out of books I hadn't read yet...so I bought American Gods. I couldn't put it down. Why had I waited to long to pick up something that Mr. Gaiman had written?! I can safely say that I'm 100% hooked on Neil Gaiman now.<br /><br />The story in American Gods is intricate and enthralling. I feel as if the book and I are old friends! I re-read it at least once a year, and always am delighted that I decided to pick it up again.<br /><br />Five stars, for sure!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I had rented the first couple of episodes of the \\"Rome\\" series at the local video store and was introduced to the characters of Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus. I found the contrast of Titus Pullo's love of the ladies, his soldier's strength and Lucius' (a married soldier with children) more temparate personality a comedic thing to watch.  Being a fan of another HBO show, \\"Deadwood\\", the violence and sex and cussing was nothing shocking. People watch the shows produced by the premium channels because you can tell stories and use language that would normally be censored in regular tv. Thank goodness!     After buying both seasons and watching them over a three day period, I can say that I feel it was a worthy investment and a welcome addition to the DVD collection. The introduction to Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus develops as the audience meets Lucius' family, Caesar and the Senate, Mark Antony and the Women of Rome (devious Atia, gentle Octavia, devastated Servila, beautiful and fascinating Cleopatra, Vorenus' wife Niobe).  The characters are well developed and the plot is rich.  In \\"Rome\\" people have many secrets, secrets that they must guard with their lives, and as an audience you are pulled into the world and the time period.     Known for having an high production cost per episode, it's quickly evident why.  The sets are beautiful as are the costumes (vibrant colors, silks, togas, soldier's equiptment, etc.)      Highlights for me include the writhing, sexy, crying, pleading, devastated, powerful, plotting Cleopatra (even though she is in the last season episodes(played by Lyndsey Marshall) both Caesars (Julius Caesar played by Ciaran Hinds and Octavius Caesar played by Simon Woods) and of course, Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson) and Vorenus (Kevin McKidd). And of course Atia of the Julii, she is sneaky, snobbish, and conniving and she has no qualms about it.     Overall, a well-crafted series all around. The slang, the scenes the costumes all serve to envelope youin Rome of the time.  Each episode is a strong one!
0783226063|4.0|Everyone and their brother hated this movie. I must admit it did have some problems, number one of which is that it was too long. But I liked it a great deal. Richard Lynch, who directed this film has directed some impressive movies including the brilliant Blue Velvet. Several actors from Blue Velvet also played in this movie and played intense characters. The evil aliens in this movie represented by the Harkonnen's were top rate bad guys played by Sting and Kenneth McMillan. For me the movie really worked because is of it's weirdness and brutality. I see weirdness as a strength in science fiction.
B002Q4TKZY|4.0|I'm going to assume that anyone looking at this listing is familiar with the movie Amélie and will stick to technical details of this release.  If you want thoughts about the movie, I suggest taking a look at the  980+ reviews of the DVD: [[ASIN:B000068QKT Amélie]]  Suffice to say that this is a \\"top 5\\" favorite movie for me, since I first saw it in a theater, or I wouldn't have bothered importing it on Blu-ray Disc.    This Blu-ray Disc was released by Icon in Australia.  It comes in a blue Amaray case that is the same height as a regular BD case but is the same thickness as a standard DVD case.      The main menu and movie are in Region A, B, C (\\"region-free\\") High Definition and will play on any Blu-ray Disc player.  The leading trailers and extras are in standard definition PAL format and will not play correctly on most USA/Canada BD players, except for region-free ones (such as Momitsu, or equivalent).    The disc opens with some copyright screens in high definition (I thought the \\"don't burn\\" one was nicely done).  These are followed by some PAL trailers that are not watchable on NTSC BD players.  The main menu button doesn't work but the trailers can easily be skipped by using the \\"chapter skip\\" button on the player remote.  That brings you to the main menu, in high definition.  The main menu doesn't have a \\"setup\\" tab.  Instead, when the movie is played, the disc defaults to the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio track with English subtitles \\"on\\" (they can be turned off if you wish).  Very convenient.  (For those folks with front projectors, please note that the subtitles are \\"Sony-style\\" and have the top line in the 2.35:1 image and the lower line below the picture.  This can be a problem for those using 2.35:1 masked screens.)    I thought the movie was lovely in high definition; I couldn't ask for a better presentation.  Perhaps someone with a higher end system can find flaws to criticize but for me, this is what I was hoping for with this purchase.  Best ofall, this release has the correct English subtitles!  The Disney/Miramax DVD release had numerous subtitle errors, some of which changed the meaning of the dialog and led to confusion.  Having the correct subtitles is a big plus for me and was the other thing I was hoping for in this release, in addition to a good high def picture.    To sum up: this release of Amélie is gorgeous in high definition and has the correct subtiles.  But the extras aren't viewable on most USA/Canada BD players.  Since I've already seen the extras on the DVD, I'm happy to have the movie in high def at last.  Very pleased with my purchase.  I'm giving this BD four stars because the extras and leading trailers can't be viewed on NTSC BD players (they could have converted them to HD).  But the movie itself is five stars all the way!
B001EVPBY4|3.0|I agree with all the wonderful things that have been written about this item, its musical values, mise-en-scene, execution, vocal and dramatic qualities.  Plaudits to all.  HOWEVER, I have yet to be able to display subtitles, in any language. Apparently there is a glitch somewhere that others have experienced as well, as one gathers from reading reviews.  Somebody wrote that perhaps it only happens with older machines.  Not so.  I have a brand new blu ray, 2009 Oppo, and though the menus do indeed translate to various languages, no subtitles display in ANY language.  The item is rare and I don't want to part with it, so I am trying to discover what it is that's causing this situation with the seller, the blu-ray manufacturer (which is splendid, flexible, and with which I have had no issues) and if I can get a hold of a contact at the manufacturer of the dvd, with them as well.  I'm in process, but I am posting this in the event somebody has already found a solution they would like to share directly with me: [...]. Any help would be warmly appreciated. If I come up with a solution, I shall post it. Obviously not all others have had problems with subtitles.  My French is rather serviceable, but I prefer the effortlessness of subtitles, which, in any event, we have paid for.<br /><br />My initial three-star review shall be augmented to five once this issue is settled.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|I bought this for a friend who was at the original Woodstock south at Yasgur's Farm. With the additional songs, DVD, etc., he is in pure heaven.<br /><br />I own the LP set but this is superb remastering, a thoughtful packaging and great liner notes/photos.<br /><br />A must for any true aficionado.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|Actually, this isn't the first mogwai I've owned, but it's certainly the best! I've never seen such an accurate looking Gizmo toy, and he even sings the same song from the film \\"Gremlins\\" (one bar sung twice in reaction to sound when Gizmo is switched on from the bottom). Gizmo's ears, hands, feet, eyes, nose, and mouth are hard plastic painted to look just as he does in the hit 1984 Spielberg film (directed by Joe Dante), and the rest of his body is plush (aside from the hard mechanical guts that allow him to rock from side to side (the \\"dancing\\" motion) covered in fur that matches the film Gizmo well. Gizmo looks and sounds fantastic. In fact, from a distance, he looks to be a near perfect replica, being basically life size and very well proportioned. He is absolutely too cool, and puts my old Gizmo Furby to shame (in fact, I think I might toss that one out now that I have this, especially since it may now have a broken muzzle like all the ones I used to see in stores; but man, the Christmas it came out, that sucker was hard to get). It's too bad this new Dancing Gizmo from Neca can't do all the things the old Furby could do, but the very fact that he looks exactly like Gizmo and sings the same tune from the film blows the old toy away. If I were to nitpick, I would only say that I wish Neca's Gizmo blinked his eyes as well, as that would have just been phenomenal in adding realism. I'd also say it would have been nice if he rocked a bit slower to match the tune he sings. Other wishes aren't worth mentioning, but those two tweaks would have been amazing.<br /><br />The only complaint I could give about Gizmo as he is would be that I did have to groom him here and there, as his fur had some odd spots of glue crust and threads that needed plucking (there was actually an odd green thread below the mouth on one side that was the main issue), and that I had to apply a little pressure to the fur around the bottom of the mouth that was becoming just slightly unglued. That particular area is the weakest point visually, as close inspection makes it obvious that it is fake fur glued to a plastic mouth. Those slight issues aside (even though they shouldn't have come up), this is a MUST for any Gremlins fan, and he'll make all your old Gremlins merchandise obsolete. If you want to stop being an '80's kid packrat and own one definitive piece of Gremlins merchandise so you can clear out everything else, this is the Gizmo you need. He's sure to wow you if you're a Gizmo fan! I only wish I had him instead of the Gizmo Furby the year I went as Billy for Halloween! I'll have to do that again someday.ular area is the weakest point visually, as close inspection makes it obvious that it is fake fur glued to a plastic mouth.

B00003CXCD|5.0|In these days of crash bang wollop films that go overboard in reality cinematics it is a pleasure to view a light hearted story such as Roman Holiday, and come away with a feel good glow. The plot is quite simple of the princess who just wants top break away from civic duties and have some fun. Gregory Peck is the perfect foil as a journalist who discovers the princess (Audrey Hepburn) is the basis to make a \\"few bucks\\"; whilst not giving away the fact that he knows who the princess really is. This is still a story worth watching.
1439102813|5.0|As we age, many of us worry about the things that we seem to be \\"forgetting\\" all the time - and worry that it may be the beginning of Alzheimer's.  This tells what it's really like as the disease progresses.
1416914307|3.0|I liked this book series a lot and read them all. However, how many times can one use the word, gingerly, properly? I cringed when I saw this word used over and over and over. Can that ruin an entertaining read? Well this particular defect was not enough to make me stop reading this novel. Nice escape for a twenty something that's still a tween at heart.
B002Y4KWS0|1.0|I have watched all the shows up to 'Life' and I kept hoping that they would turn it around, but I don't think that is going to happen. There is no humor, no tech, no aliens, even tho they are on a vastly advanced alien ship. A ship filled with people you will learn to dislike.There is not one character that stands out as interesting. They have constant contact with earth through some stone shown during SG1, but instead of swapping places with people who could go onto the ship to help figure out how to take control of it, they simple use the device to visit family at home.    This show is dark and slow paced, but more importantly its boring. I find it hard to believe that the current writers understood the first 2 SG shows. The lack of an interesting plot shows the wrong writers were picked for the job.    Unless they start to take a diffrent direction I would avoid this show.
