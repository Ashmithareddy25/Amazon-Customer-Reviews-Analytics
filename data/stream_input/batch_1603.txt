B007J4T2G8|2.0|After all the hoopla I had heard about this book, I was very anxious to read it.  Well okay, the first half of book was interesting, but honestly after that it's the same old stuff.  They fight, they have make-up sex, then they have make-up make-up sex.  Unfortunately, I got sucked up into reading the second book, but wished I hadn't, cause it's more fo the same.  Needless to say I won't be reading the third one, especially at that price.  Save your money, and just read some good porn........
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Mind blowing and mind engaging.  You have to pay attention all the way, but worth the effort.  Well acted, great story.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|Mystery, sifi, great ending. This movie will keep you entertained with a lot of action, adventure all in a love story with a twist. It is great for both men and women, but would be considered to be a chick flick from my point of view. If you like Raiders of the lost ark you might like this movie.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|My son and all of us actually just love that panda!!!! We can watch it again and again and again!!!!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I freakin' love this series!  Best book so far, very quick read considering the length.  A whole lot happens.  Can not wait for the next seasons on HBO to come out.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Free Kindle version of the classic holiday tale.  Easy to read -- only drawback of course is the free version contains no images/drawings.  But if all you want are the words as a reminder or something to check a quote, then this version is perfect.  I find when I have time to re-read some favorite passages from the classics and the free Kindle version works well for that.
B007M45PMU|2.0|My fiance loves the Ho Hey song and all of it's boring and drab lyrics.  So, I bought this \\"album\\" and was amazed at the lack of creativity this band possesses.  Eleven more equally boring tracks with less catchy tunes was enough for me to scrap this album (and the band) from my iTunes.  This is the worst of the worst if you ask me.  It's not bad enough to be truly unworthy of radio play, yet it rivals Mumford & Sons' Sigh No More for Blandest Album of the Year Award.  This album makes Grouplove's Never Trust a Happy Song sound like the indie rock album of the decade.  My suggestion?  Grab a copy of Of Monsters and Men's My Head is an Animal and toss the Lumineers in the Goodwill pile.
B004M8S6FC|4.0|This is a very good book. Easy and quick and excelent story.<br />You can believe in the characters and attach to them. At some parts, the story gets you thinking about life and human relations.<br />I reccomend for a fun-reading experience.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book (and the whole trilogy) were very horribly written. The author repeated herself constantly; we were reminded every single page of how hot Christian is and how Ana flushes and bites her lip for every single thing. Overall, this book made me roll my eyes and wonder why I wasted my money.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is no doubt that this book will draw you in so much that even though you will cringe at the juvenile writing, you will keep turning the pages to find out more. Dare I say, you may even get excited (as in sexually, which may speak more to the fact that every once in a while, we need stimulation in the bedroom, but our imaginations would suffice, we don't need bad fiction to do it for us). But as you begin reading the second part of the trilogy, you realize you've been duped, and that the writer absolutely loved to use copy and paste - OVER AND OVER AND OVER. The sex scenes get boring (yes, really), the story mundane and predictable, the main characters baffling in the wrong kind of way (do 20 somethings talk like that? do 40 somethings talk like that? do (real) psychologists rip their hair out reading this stuff?).<br /><br />I never bought or read the last book, Fifty Shades Freed, as I could not justify being taken for a third time.  I know better than that, I know better what good fiction is.  So when a friend gave me a REAL book to read, I reveled in the experience of good, honest, and in-depth writing.  Something this book cannot even aspire to, no matter what its popularity.<br /><br />But trial and error is what drives the sale of this weird phenomenon - and you will most likely succumb to it. Beware - you will feel cheated.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Fun game. Has lots of weapons. great graphics. easy to play. fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Everyone should have a Christian Grey sometime in their lives. Wow! Didn't know what I was missing until reading this Novel. He could certainly teach some of our Aussie blokes about making love to a woman, and apart from a lot of excess baggage in his childhood he would be nice to know in real life. Found the story line a little weak, hence the 4 stars.
B00004W510|5.0|make sure and add this super cd to your collection.also in netflix, watch in classic albums: the making ig 'music from big pink and 'the band' brown cover cd.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have just finished reading the first of this entertaining trilogy and I must say it was just that entertaining. However I've had my fill of the weird and very truly warped Mr. Grey.. So I will not be reading the other two.  All I can say is once all the young ladies finish reading even the first of them you should have a thorough idea of what you don't want in a man.  Not even money can buy a healthy mind..unless one invests in Christ!
B0063GORYU|4.0|The Kindle version of this game is better than the Windows version, because you can tap a card to move it to the logical destination, rather than having to drag it.  So you can play faster.  Of course you can drag the cards if you want to.  The only shortcoming is in their algorithm that identifies the best move to make when you tap the card.  It makes too many mistakes in obvious situations (i.e., putting the cards you are moving into the wrong column), and that is the only reason for four stars instead of five.  It's a great game overall, though, fun to play and easy to handle on the Kindle.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|This film is very well done. Although a fictional story, it gives us an honest and realistic perspective on racism's end-game. Norton was phenomenal as was the whole cast. Good writing and directing too.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|Could not wait to finish these. A read that I would like to forget. Not well written and the subject was not one I cared for at all. Am worried that they are such big hits with our youngsters.
B00355L2TU|4.0|This dvd is great for all levels, I think.  It pushes you to work hard but does not kill you (I did Insanity last fall and that one KILLS!).  Even on the tougher aspects of this workout, you can always say to yourself, hey, there's only 20 minutes total...I can do this for 20 minutes!  : )  I think it is a great workout...It will definitely get results if your diet is also in check.  : )
B00138J4QO|4.0|This music brings back some good memories of music that both I and my mother enjoyed (way back in the late 1960's).  I can remember singing along and my mother humming along with the music.  He had a great voice!
B004HD61KE|4.0|This is a great read, just like all his books. Continuation of the Sigma series is awesome.  The American history in this one is fascinating. Couple that with military special forces, what's not to like.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|While I don't find the writing of the 50 shades books to be very good, I will say the story is intriguing. I actually read book one as part of my book club, but chose to read the 2nd book as I wanted to know what caused Christian to be the type of person he is. There is certainly a lot of filler, but I appreciate the story and psychological ramifications of a difficult childhood. I haven't started book 3, but will probably do so soon- just to keep up with the discussions with my friends and co-workers (at least that is why I will say I am finishing it!).
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was as good as the book and closer to the book version than I have ever seen done.  Excellently written that makes it hard to put down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was another book club selection for me. I enjoyed that it was written from two points of view. There are several twists and unexpected sub-plots. Everyone in my book club liked the book. I never saw the final play of the game coming.
B006646N0U|5.0|Thought I would get this as a late night watch for my kindle fire. It was great. In fact, it was one the that I haven't seen on the local show. Enjoyed every minute!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I bought this app with minimal knowledge of it, but figured it would be worth 99 cents if it kept my 3 year old engaged for a few minutes. The game is actually quite fun- and a bit educational. Without being overtly physics intensive, it teaches about general physics properties in a really fun way. My son would like to play it 24/7, so I have to limit his time. But, I have also found myself playing it when the 3 year old isn't around (don't tell him!).
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This was such a disappointing read. The first book was alright, but as I kept reading I found the main characters Anastasia and Christian more and more unrealistic and unrelatable. The plot is extremely predictable and unchallenging, I found myself only finishing the series because I don't like to start a book and not finish it. And another part of me wished it would get better, but it didn't. I'm really disappointed with this series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story is a modern metaphor for Rome around the time of Christ. The capital, now located somewhere around Colorado Springs, is what is left after a series of natural and man-made disasters. The 12 satellite districts whose people live in abject poverty, each produce specific goods which are consumed by wealthy population of the capital. In retribution for one of the districts (completely destroyed by the standing army)rebelling against the capital, annual games are held where a male and female over the age of 12 are selected by a drawing in each district to fight the pair from the other districts and ultimately each other to the death (Roman gladiatorial contests?), with a single winner emerging to live in modest luxury as a reward. The story follows a young woman who happens to be a skilled hunter and her male companion from the same district as they participate in the contest. The details of the story are exceptionally well written and the twists and turns made it hard for me to put the book down. I can't wait to read the next in the trilogy.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was reluctant to purchase Fifty Shades. I thought it would be really vulgar and just not anything that I would want to read... but... I found that it was a very moving and very touching love story. The characters became real to me and at the conclusion, I did not want the story to end. I will read it again.
B008602KQI|4.0|Hunger Games the film is a good movie based quite closely on an enjoyable book.  The fact that it IS a good movie is the reason I would recommend the DVD.  However the additional features on the DVD and BluRay are a mixed bag.  No commentary, which depending on who was doing it could be good or bad.  Donald Sutherland apparently found all kinds of political depth to the story beyond what is there in the story itself.  And he really goes on and on......and on.  I guess that that might have been the bad part if there had been a commentary....they might have had him talking and my oh my he must be missing making the movie MASH.<br />The politics of Sutherland could sink the film for you if you were to watch the few shorts first.<br /><br />But extras (or lack thereof)aside, the movie itself is quite enjoyable.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I read \\"Matched\\" just out of idle curiousity.  The dystopia was moderately interesting (as unbelievable as \\"The Hunger Games\\", just in a different direction).  Once I started the series, I figured I might as well see how it ends.  Well, Vol. 2 was ok, nothing great or earth-shattering.  However, if I were a 10 or 12-year old girl who wasn't steeped in SF and alternate histories, my mind would probably have been blown.  The Golden Age of science fiction is 12.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The best way to review this book is simply to tell you that it is a superbly written story of loss, grief , self reliance and healing. The story of the hike, which I was afraid might be boring, was anything but!!!!
B000001DQI|1.0|It sounds like the Wicked Witch of the West is singing!!! Hey Elton, where's Dorothy??? You need to go see the Wizard so he can give you some talent, because this album sucks!!!
B002WQ7XO6|5.0|Loved it!!! I have seen it many tmes and it never gets old! Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are great together and are hilarious!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I now own both quell games thanks to amazon, and I couldn't be happier. Both are very relaxing games that challenge you to think outside the box, and both can be quite devious at times.<br /><br />Definitely get it while it's free, and I would also whole heartedly recommend buying both games as well.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Although I prefer the details in the book, I really love this movie.  Jennifer Lawrence did a great job as Katniss, and Elizabeth Banks was amazing as Effie.  I can't wait for the second and third movies!  Definitely worth watching!
B00846REIS|4.0|THIS IS A GOOD BOOK. A LITTLE LIKE FIFTY SHADES. EXCEPT THE MAIN MALE CHARACTER IS NOTHING LIKE CHRISTIAN. I ENJOYED READING IT THO.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I had heard about this book from several friends. It was slow from the start but gave it my all hoping for a stunning ending!  Disappointing to say the least!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is one of the funnest games i have played, good time waist-er. Just a fun game I would recommend  this game.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I enjoyed the characters and the diversity of the story line. I have enjoyed other DeMille stories and would definitely look for more
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I had downloaded this to try and help me sleep. So far I really like the melodies on the free version. It has helped me sleep at night.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not a big book reader but a friend recommended this series, and I'm glad she did! I read all 3 back to back! It's a great series, definately recommend!! :)
B007CGNOAI|5.0|This movie brings to surface the realities many face, almost daily. Its a journey and perspective from three people who are going through life and struggling to cope in their own right. From losing someone to believing suicide is the answer, this film is epic in capturing that which many turn a blind eye and deaf ear to. I highly recommend this. The trailer gives a good idea to its tone. But the message lies beneath the surface.
B005MVLI8A|2.0|The album is a classic and I love it. This review is of the technical efforts in bringing the album into an mp3 format.<br /><br />Since the beginning of the MP3 \\"revolution\\", I've been ripping my own CD's and creating my vast library of music and I like to think I know a thing or two about how to make a decent sounding MP3. But, hard drives fail and CD's become scratched, so I turn to Amazon...<br /><br />These files appear to be encoded as \\"constant 256 Kbps\\", where as most of the music I get from Amazon is \\"Variable bit rate\\". The difference is, Variable will dip below 256 Kbps when nothing is going on, but will exceed 256 Kbps when sounds require higher fidelity, thus giving you a better sounding MP3 with about the same file size. If you have a good program to encode with, you can set the lower and upper limits of your Variable encoding to ensure decent sound quality.<br /><br />With these MP3s, I can hear \\"artifacts\\" in the high tones, specifically the cymbals. It's rather annoying. I should have borrowed a CD from a friend and encoded it myself, but who has CD's these day?
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much and plan to read more in the series.  Nicely paced, intriguing characters, great sense of place.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a great story. My only complaint is the overuse of the f-word. I may be old-fashioned, but it really detracts from the story for me. Do people really talk like this? If so, they need to go back to school and learn the English language.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|As with the other books in this series, while entertaining if you like the erotic it is lacking in depth and substance. The characters seem too one dimensional and randomly thrown together.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|It was one of my favorite books as a child, so I HAD to go see it (with my husband, on date night) in 3D when it came out! We both LOVED it and decided to buy it for our kids. They would watch it all day/night if we would let them! :-)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Since I read on Kindle for Ipad, I had no idea how long this book was.  When I read Under The Dome I had it's heft in hand and knew what I was getting into. Regardless this is a very well researched and written book.
B007VYDFMS|4.0|This was a great documentary that really lets you see how Bob Marley grew up, where he was from and how he became such a great musical sensation. Definitely worth it to watch :)
B0086QS7N2|5.0|After all these years, this album reminds me of Gene Simmons's comment about Rush (the basic gist of it anyway), \\"No other band sounds like that, it's Rush.\\"<br />Much like Star Wars fans, If you're a Rush fan you're probably going to dig what they put out to some degree simply because they're Rush.<br />While Geddy's voice doesn't soar like it did way back when, they create the vocals around this reality and even after they've been at it for almost 40 years, they can still play amazingly.<br />I love how they've even gotten a bit heavier as they've aged, but not every track here is heavy. In typical Neil fashion though, every track is considered and powerful in its message.<br />The early released tracks, Caravan and BU2B are easy to like instantly (and sounded amazing live on the Time Machine Tour by the way). Other songs require more attention and time. The sign of a great album.<br />And, the entire album download us available for $5.99! I'd have bought it regardless of the price, but a price this low is a nice bonus.
B007SGM084|4.0|If you can get around the spelling mistakes, misused words, and a little redundancy and the fact that she calls her vagina and clitoris \\"my sex\\" then its really not bad. I got hooked reading it, wanting to find out what happened next. The sex scenes are pretty hot and some of them are quite intense, but the story line is what hooks you. If your someone who's having \\"vanilla sex\\", as the book says, it gives you plenty of ideas on how to spice up your sex life. Over all I think its a good read.
B008MBXFEM|5.0|This soundtrack is better than Batman Begins and Dark Knight and it's not even close. There's a different vibe this time around. There's some similar tones, but some fresh ones as well.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|Where do you start?  This one left too many unaswered questions on the table.  The way it ended was strange and seemed like he could not think of anything more creative to do.  So unless he sent them to another planet, I don't see how they get to start over.  He goes through alot of trouble with the restoration of memory in the plot and then never revels to the reader any memories to explain behavior.<br /><br />The idea of a government using biological agents on it's citizens to control population is very thought provoking to say the least.  Kuddos for that line of thought.  Not impressed with the rest of the story line.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have not read a book in years got a Kindle for a gift and these three books finished those books in 4 days like them so much I am now rereading them and still enjoying the book.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|While this book explains what leads to the events in the trilogy, it feels disconnected.  The characters are completely different.  You aren't introduced to Thomas until the last few paragraphs of the book.  It seems as if the author is leaving himself room for a second prequel that will discuss the training of Thomas and Teresa.  That would make more sense.  I liked the book overall, but it wasn't the barn burner that you just couldn't put down.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Like pre-ordering DVD's from Amazon, always arrive on time and price is competitive Enjoyed the book, enjoyed the movie and will occasionally enjoy the DVD when we have a video night. Our teenage girls love it.
B003YTLKTE|5.0|If you see this and have like it. Make it a point to see the broadway production of it. Adding words to reach 20!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Again, like the Maze Runner, I couldn't wait to finish my day and read this book every night.  I love the twists and turns and new tangents it pursues.  It really kept my interest and intrigued me as I tried to figure out what was in store for the group.  I couldn't wait to get to the end.
B0019IB0II|5.0|This book is  one of the best books I have ever read. I have gainned a lot of insight on the facts that brought the writter to her illness. Everyone should read it.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|I published my first book for Kindle in 2008.<br /><br />In those days, there was a \\"start-up\\" feeling, an exciting new idea, with new technology we were all learning. Many people had basic questions, like \\"How big should my pictures be? and Amazon had few detailed, technical answers.<br /><br />Four years later, this latest effort continues that tradition.<br /><br />This thin \\"manual\\" lacks useful detail.<br /><br />-- It does not deal with specifications for different models of Kindle.<br /><br />-- It does not provide useful technical information about images and graphics.<br /><br />-- It is not specific enough about HTML coding and the process for producing valid files.<br /><br />Kindle technology has matured; training for KDP authors has not.<br /><br />Brian Dean<br />Kindle Author
B007L3BMGA|4.0|A easy read, but very centered around the two main characters. Starts off fresh but slowly becomes a little repetitive in theme and character. Not everyone taste, but did get a lot of talking points round the office cooler.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|The instant video was very clear and the surround sound was amazing. No buffering issues. The Movie wasvery good but as with anybook based movie, the book is always better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|well I have been thinking long and hard about words to describe 101 and +27 games and allxixhave come up with is awesome. plus ixwant the points from this Wichita is awesome that they do.
B003IWRE3I|4.0|Very entertaining. I does follow the same lines as other stories in this category, like Eli. It put another twist on survival.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to you, although similar to 50 shades, quickly comes into its own & You can't help becoming attached to the characters.<br />Found myself very disappointed when I read the last page. Not because of the story but that I wanted more.<br />I can't wait for the next book to be released.
B008602KQI|2.0|This is a very sad movie. Young people thrust into a killing mode for the sport of others. How sick are we getting [or have gotten] as a society? We need to stop making these types of movies and start making movies about saints and holy, upright people as models to be emulated. Violence begets violence. Is that what we really want for our society?<br /><br />As far as Amazon is concerned, the product was delivered rapidly and in great condition. Very satisfied with Amazon.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|Especially the second part of the book makes you hooked with interesting twists to the story, so that you want to keep reading until you find out about the mystery of the disappeard girl.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest so it was a pleasant surprise to find an app for it. Using my browser to go into pinterest on my Kindle Fire would cause the script to stop working every few minutes, so when I saw the app I immediately installed it and I haven't had any problems using it at all. Love it!
034580404X|3.0|********MINOR SPOILERS**********<br />Broadly speaking, I don't read the romance genre, and more specifically, \\"mommy porn,\\" so I'm really glad I felt compelled by all the hoopla to read Fifty Shades. Why? Mostly because it was a fun summer read - total brain candy. And beyond that, I learned something. I don't think I'm the only reader who never guessed that a whole category of people subscribes to a \\"BDSM\\" lifestyle that generally requires signed consent forms. (I should acknowledge at this point that other reviewers say this trilogy was an inaccurate portrayal of BDSM.)<br /><br />Other reviewers also have delivered a well-deserved pummeling to this series for poor writing and editing. I would be remiss if I didn't take a few jabs myself.<br /><br />The first thing to annoy me was the stilted dialogue. These are 20-somethings talking: \\"Where's Miss Kavanaugh's car?\\" and \\"Thank you for the tea, Mr. Grey.\\" Having only been to the Pacific Northwest a couple of times on vacations, I found myself wondering whether they address one another more formally than we do here in the Midwest. Then I read that the author was British. Hmmm. Is that why Christian Grey beckons to Anastasia by saying, \\"Come,\\" instead of \\"Come here\\" or \\"Come on\\" as most Americans would in casual dialogue?<br /><br />The second thing to annoy me was the author's repetitiveness. Reviewers have thoroughly documented her overuse of various words and phrases, so I'll just say that I agree and leave it at that. This wasn't entirely her fault. Editors exist for a reason.<br /><br />The third annoyance was the run-on sex scenes. Talk about redundancy. Even those of us unfamiliar with BDSM can figure it out pretty quickly after one description. Without literally counting pages, I would estimate the sex scenes comprise half the text. The author appears to be reaching for ways to outdo each of the previous scenes, but she mostly fails - especially when the all-too-frequent encounters start to defy what's physically possible.<br /><br />Now one might wonder why I thought this was a fun summer read. Well, after figuring out that I could skim through the sex scenes without missing much, and after learning to ignore the pretentious dialogue, I found a decent little story line. Yes, many disagree with this. But I'm not arguing that this is ground-breaking material. Rather, it's an escapist's fantasy, complete with a gorgeous billionaire who owns everything from a helicopter to a home in Aspen and doesn't mind sharing his toys and lavishing attention on his newfound love interest. There was a hint of mystery as the author left it until the final book to give details about how this outwardly perfect man became so flawed, and there were some mildly entertaining side stories involving the main characters' friends and siblings. Finally, an implausible action/rescue scene nevertheless provided some needed tension and resolution for the plot, such as it was. And some interesting, if shallow, psychological themes were distributed throughout the story.<br /><br />With good editing - no, make that great editing - this could have been an excellent addition to the adult romance genre. Instead, it's a slightly better than mediocre read - not as bad as many are saying but definitely not a classic. Simply put, the Fifty Shades trilogy is nothing more than quick and easy entertainment.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book to see what all the excitement was. It's entertaining but lacking in substance. It kept my interest through most of the book (which is more than I can say for most books), but I wouldn't read the next books in the series.
B002VE5472|3.0|The movie itself was watchable.  The cast was perfect for the movie and the movie, in general, was pretty good.  The ending was kind of hokie, but it's worth a watch.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Absolutely my grandsons favorite. He is 2 years old and loves putting the puzzles together. Especially the ones that spin after wards when you touch them.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is one of those books that hooks you right from the start and just keeps pulling you towards the final page. The determination of the hero to overcome his fear is palpable. Having been a seaman for 15 years I can tell you that the author has done his research especially on the contents and construction of lifeboats as they were 30 years ago. When you get to the end it is one of those books that makes you feel content but at the same time wanting more. A great read for all ages from Amazon.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|This book is laugh out loud funny.  At times I wanted to read lines to my husband but my kids would be around and I would have to find ways to change what I was saying.  And no, I could not wait for the kids to leave the room to read it to him properly.  It was too damn funny for me to have to wait to go on reading the next bit.  Beyond being hysterical the book is also poignant and relevant.  I would say that it is politically relevant given the current climate surrounding women's issues in the United States (and elsewhere) but that would be limiting the scope of the book and since I do not want to be limited by the politics (or politicians of this country) I certainly do not want to place that limitation on \\"How to be a Woman.\\". For anyone who is a woman and wants to remain in control of her own body and for the men who love, respect, admire and support our right to do so, enjoy!
B007MU85D0|5.0|Great jams to sit back and relax to and ponder life's questions. I would also recommend the Head and the Heart and the Lumineers if you want to ponder life a little longer.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was a fair rendition of the book.  In the short time it was not possible to delve into more character development.  The relationship between Katniss and Gale is not well understood.  It would also be better if the we could have known more about the day to day struggles of the residents of the district.  All in all a very enjoyable movie.  Donald Sutherland is good as the president.  Just the right amount of sinister.
B00846TTDG|2.0|This one you should see as a rental. Not purchase material and not an \\"A\\" list choice but still interesting and fairly well made too. Check out \\"Fortress\\" if you like this movie. (It's about a bomber crew during the war) It's a much better movie.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Marvel Comics superheroes are in one movie. Not all the Marvel Comics characters are in \\"The Avengers\\" actually (Spider-Man seems busy doing \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\"), but the list is impressive enough to call it an all-star cast - Captain America, The Hulk, Iron Man and Thor (each of whom has his own live-action movie), as well as Black Widow (who was in \\"Iron Man 2\\") and Hawkeye (briefly seen in \\"Thor\\"). Led by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D., an international peace keeping force, they form a team The Avengers to save humans from total destruction.<br /><br />The storyline of the 143 minute movie is simple, and it should be so. The film's opening is rather slow, taking time to explain the Tesseract (or the Cosmic Cube) and its unlimited power, and Thor's adoptive brother Loki, who steals it from S.H.I.E.L.D. Be patient and wait for the story to get interesting as principal characters enter one after another.<br /><br />But what makes \\"The Avengers\\" special is not the story itself or its state-of-the-art computer graphics; it is the characters and the amusing interactions between them that takes the film several notches up. The combat sequence in Manhattan is certainly thrilling (if a bit too long), but the greatest strength of \\"The Avengers\\" is that the film captures the personalities of superheroes. It is not just the way how Iron Man fights, but how cynical and narcissistic Tony Stark talks (and irritates Steve Rogers), that attracts us most. And the way Robert Downey Jr. delivers his lines is always fun to watch.<br /><br />If I may choose my favorite character, it is Bruce Banner played by Mark Ruffalo, but some viewers would find other characters more interesting. In \\"The Avengers\\" all characters including Nick Fury and Phil Coulson have their moment to shine and that is part of the film's appeal.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great fun, a roller coaster. Loved the way this book was told from the prospective of the husband and the wife.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This show never disappoints. Every episode is well written, engaging, humorous, interesting and very entertaining. Some TV series seem to fizzle out after the first season but not this one. It's still as great in the third season as it was in the beginning. I highly recommend it.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|Curiosity got the better of me and I bought this book to find out what happens between Mr Grey and Ana. I understand where the author was going with the storyline about a child growing up believing he was unlovable and the woman who shows him to love and be loved. The first novel was repetitive and boring at times and it carried through to this second book. The classic is virgin to multi-orgasmic in record time....if only !!!
B008602KQI|5.0|the hunger games dvd was longly anticipated by my self.  it did not disapoint me.  i have read the entire hunger games trilogy, and at 73, I thorougly engoyed it!
B008602KQI|5.0|Was lots of fun to watch this movie!  I enjoyed the interpretation of the books settings and the characters were very believable.
B008EQIK90|5.0|Lots of action and very entertaining. A film to watch when you need a good laugh. These guys play off each other like Martin and Lewis.
1613832796|2.0|I bought this book, expecting a full-size hardcover book. It was priced cheaper, but I figured priced competitively. It turned out to be a small hard-cover book, the size of paperbacks. If I would have known, I would have purchased the full size hardcover for the additional price, or I would have bought the paperback for cheaper.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An excellent read. Once I started I could not put it down! What an adventure. It is rare that a book makes me cry but I couldn't help myself. As soon as I was finished, I ordered Catching Fire for the Kindle!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book started out a little slow for me but got much better as I read on. The story was very suspensful, couldn't put it down. Not sure if i liked the ending.  I heard that there will be a movie coming out, can't to see it!
0143119680|3.0|While the story contains interesting elements, you have to get past the Harlequin Romance moments (totally unappealing to me!) plus some of the (to the average reader) esoteric and abstract aspects.  I'm not decrying including these, just saying it gets a bit foggy at times.  Interested enough to travel (almost did a spoiler) to the  sequel, but certainly not in hardback.
B00002R0MC|5.0|I overlooked this along with several other Bob Marley compilations over the years as I have an extensive collection of his work, and at first glance this set contains what appears to be many repeats, however, so many of these songs are older versions, alternate works, live, studio takes etc... The sound quality is certainly not at the level of his later studio mastered, and remastered albums, but it's very acceptable considering what it is, and it's on par with other early tracks and b-sides from the great Marley. A nice look at some raw works that later became masterpieces! Hope you enjoy it, I know I did!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was an exceptional book.  Definitely has a lot of underlying \\"human nature\\" elements in it.  Highly recommended.  If I could have one complaint about this book, its that the series isn't very sequential so I don't know what book to read next!
B000FC146C|5.0|The Thorn Birds is the book I have read the most over the years. I decided to get it on my Kindle and do another re-read. As I grow older, I've come to see the story in different ways, able to get a different perspective. I suppose now I can understand the \\"ick\\" factor of Ralph and Meggie at least from Ralph's side. I've also come to realize I don't care much for his character at all. He is conceited and led Meggie on all those years. Yes, he admitted as much but I don't think he ever really felt remorse for doing so. I blindly overlooked these character flaws because I so loved Richard Chamberlain's movie version of the character. On the other end of the spectrum, the television mini-series ruined the character of Dane for me. The actor they chose to portray him was a terrible choice. He had none of the beauty of Ralph or Meggie in either the movie or the book description.<br /><br />The descriptions of Australia have become a favorite part of my re-reading. The vast differences between the Outback and North Queensland is astounding. And I basically want to move to Matlock Island and never leave.
B00846REIS|3.0|I purchased \\"Bared to You\\", I had heard it was like \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\". I did read the entire book, but I would not and have not recommended it to friends. While \\"Gray\\" was erotic, we did care about the characters, this book is too graphic and the characters were too similar to Christian and Anastasia. But to me, the sex scenes were just too graphic and not what I enjoy reading.
0345803485|5.0|You either love it or you hate it. I personally LOVED this book. I wasn't convinced this book was a best-seller, and the jokes people made about it left me unsure, but one of my good friends started it and said she couldn't put it down.  I was pet sitting one weekend and on their coffee table lie Fifty Shades of Grey. I decided to read a couple of chapters to see what all of the hype was about and I became so captivated with the story that I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />There's a LOT of sex in these books. I read them while I was going to and from school on the train every day.  I read the entire series in about a week because I couldn't put them down.  I just loved the relationship that Ana and Christian formed. Aside from the sex, the love story was very intriguing. I would like to think there are people that find love like Christian had for Ana. I'm a little surprised by all of the negative reviews but we all have different taste, so it is what it is.  I thoroughly enjoyed these books. Highly recommended.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was pleasently suprised with this movie. To be honest I was expecting the teen book translation to be more like Twilight than the last Harry Potter.  I hope they spend some of the extra cash they made on sets, costumes & special effects.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I loved reading the story about Will and Layken. I just wish the book was longer! I read through it in a day, thinking that I finally had some reading material and it was over before I knew it.
B008EQIK90|2.0|The slap stick in this comedy just didn't connect with me. I thought the actors were great. The silliness put me off.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I got Weather Live so that I could see approaching storms on Doppler radar as I live in a beach community. Unfortunately that feature is not part of what I got.
B00870Z9HY|2.0|I had so enjoyed the phantom and hum the tunes even now. The sequel has wonderful singers, beautiful sets, great orchestration, and a dramatic story to tell, but the music doesn't sing in my head. Not a disappointment, just not the stellar music of the original.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|My son is crazy over angry birds,  he know has his room done in it. Ever since he started playing it is now his favorite!  I enjoy playing and how it has its challenges very intertwining and dome what addicting too.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|So sorry that I did not read this book sooner!<br /><br />I don't think I have read another book that has made me laugh out loud and cry my eyes out....all on the same page. Wow, did I ever like this book!<br /><br />There was such depth to all of Colleen Hoover's characters that you could feel them manifest from the page. Will and Layken's journey was riveting to follow and I'm so glad I got a front row seat.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the next book, [[ASIN:B008TRU9HU Point of Retreat]] immediately.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|DRAW SOMETHING is great fun with friends online - with the grandkids it improves their word skills - grandma needs some drawing \\"hints\\" I can't line up 2 lines or add to a line . . . maybe a stylus would help.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the Pinterest app for the Kindle Fire. I'm just excited there's finally an app for it. It works perfectly and fast.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I had to buy this book the minute I finished Mistborn (the first in the trilogy).  It's an engaging fantasy world and the magic system is very well explained and interesting.  Brandon Sanderson is quickly becoming one of my favorite fantasy writers.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|An amazing book, full of detail.  Creates a landscape of the places and people in mind.  I would love to visit the place to see where these amazing people live and how they live!
B0050C863G|5.0|We all make good intentions about wanting to ease down, approaching things in a more relaxed way, but in reality we hardly ever move beyond the point of 'good intentions'. Now, this book can really made a difference. Andy succeeded in scraping all the spiritual and religious dust off meditation and this feels like a huge relief to atheists like me! Moreover, his great stories do not only prove valuable points about meditation, his stories also show he learned the art of not taking everything too serious, he has the ability to reflect upon his own life with great humor not avoiding his own struggles and mistakes. This makes the book all the more human and therefor accessible.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Samcro plot thickens as tensions between clay morrow and jax teller clash when past letters from john teller comes back to haunt them. Loved just about everything about this season. Makes you see what life in a motorcycle club is like. Can't wait tell next week season 5 starts!
B000FC146C|5.0|i HAVE READ THIS BOOK OVER 4 TIMES AND REALLY LOVE IT. The family drama will hold your attention all the way thought the book and what a great love story.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|This was not one of Philippa Gregory's best.  The book was pretty dull and I found myself skimming through sections because of the endless details describing unimportant things.  The main character was not very interesting or exciting.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I sure don't see what the hype was about.<br />The only person to get anything out of this was the author
B008BM9L72|1.0|i bought all 3 of the books anticipating a captivating read that most people have been talking about. i couldnt even get through the first one. im not bothered by sex or anything like tha but i felt it was badly written and very very repetitive, not much a story. the scenes are all the same and it gets tired.would't recommend this to anyone. 50 shades of nonsense
B003YFIUW8|3.0|The book bogged down in the smallest of detail and descriptions.  I thought it lacked emotional substance.  I wish the book had gotten into the mother's head and heart more.  I wouldn't have read the book unless it was a book club selection.  I will say the review discussion should be interesting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My family loves this app! All ages can play and it's very colorful. There are different level of play, and also different ways to play. But becareful, it can be addictive!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use the app all of the time to continue reading my Kindle books.  It's one of the most used apps on my Thrive tablet.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Waiting impatiently for 'Shades of Christian'  I read the Trilogy from Ana's point of view twice and would now like Christian's point of view.  Best reading I have had for a long time
B0054LVP3Q|4.0|I was looking for a light summer book and found this to be fulfilling. It keep my attention and although somewhat predictable i enjoyed the read. I would definitely read another book by this author in the future.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|It was a good book but i predicted the end. It was based in same towns and type of setting as most of his work. It is a tear jerker at times.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent read. The sex scenes are graphic, the intensity and love story of the characters is intriguiging and keeps you engaged on the story at all times.
B004XZR63M|5.0|It is a really good book for those who want to know the secret to being rich, but don't want to read a boring book that just tells you what to do with your money. He incorporates his ideas into the story of his life. That is what makes this book such a fascinating read.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Wonderful review of history in my time.  Refreshing to see public service continued by all the presidents covered.  Recomended for Republicans and Democrats alike.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After everyone has already seen the hunger games...its hard to write a review that gives good feedback. Honestly, the movie is quite similar to the book with a few exceptions. If you haven't seen the movie yet...I would read the book first. It is hard to read something when you already know what happens.
B007ZMD14I|5.0|This is one of the best albums slash has ever done! It's almost a mashup of all of slashes different bands. It has the sound of Guns n Roses, Slash's Snake Pit, Velvet Revolver and his solo album \\"Slash\\" all rolled into one! Myles Kennedy also adds some great range to the album himself. Of course he brings some of the sounds from \\"Alter Bridge\\" but also gives it sound similar too \\"Wolfmother\\".<br /><br />I must have listened to this album 10 times through before I changed my playlist!
B008ASLK8A|3.0|I loved the first Sherlock Holmes so i was quite excited when this one was announced. I unfortunately didn't make it to the theaters to see the movie, but rented it using Amazon Video on Demand. I was pretty disappointed. The plot was hard to follow. The entire storyline was not on par with the first movie. They left it open for another one (of course), but I don't think I'll be spending anymore of my time watching these movies.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Adult theme and language with teenage trama. Second class suspense. To read when you have nothing more important to read or do.
B000062XGF|5.0|Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery) is a master international art thief and he is the primary suspect in the theft of a priceless Rembrandt painting.  The job was a masterpiece of crimes and he came into the skyscraper from the outside by removing the 400 pound window and disabling the alarm from the outside of the building while hanging 70 stories above the ground.  He mails the painting to his client using the building's own mail system.<br /><br />Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is an investigator for the insurance company and she suspects him because the crime is flawlessly done.  Even though he is 60 years old he is still considered a master thief but he isn't Spiderman anymore according to Baker's boss.  Baker plans a sting operation to entrap MacDougal.  He seems to fall for it and the action is on......<br /><br />This is a very entertaining movie and I enjoyed it a lot.  Two super stars in the movie and a good plot made a great story.  The chemistry between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery is palpitating and the movie scenes are shot in some very beautiful and unique locations around the globe.  The action scenes were well done and it was an enjoyable movie to watch.  I recommend it to you as fun entertainment and worthwhile to buy and watch.
B001L63JC8|4.0|Not a lot to say here that hasn't been said by other reviewers about this phenomenal album.  For me, it's far closer to a classical symphony than it is to traditional rock.  Yes there is a story that holds all 4 sides of the album together.  A story you will most likely tear your hair out trying to understand.  Best just to enjoy some of the greatest music Genesis ever made.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This movie is very farfetched for a semi Sci-Fi movie but I loved the action and the roles the actors played. It is entertainment and not a science lesson and from that aspect I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The movie opened with a narration of the asteroid just 6 miles wide hitting the Earth and killing all of the dinosaurs on Earth 65 million years ago. Now an asteroid the size of Texas is heading towards the Earth and it will arrive in only 18 days. This will cause a global extinction event and this time we are on the list of creatures to become extinct!<br /><br />A plan is developed to place a nuclear bomb deep into the asteroid to try to detonate it and beak it into two chunks that will miss the Earth. (I know, it's not possible but it is a movie for entertainment) NASA has the spacecraft and equipment to get there but not the drilling know how. Since the schedule is so tight they are forced to use the best deep sea oil drilling team to have them train the astronauts on how to use the equipment. Time is of the essence and they wind up sending the misfit drillers into space to get the job done.....<br /><br />This movie is funny, exciting, and full of action. It is not the best movie out there but it is so entertaining that it makes up for its shortcomings. The cast is an all-star cast with Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan. Throw your science books away, put your brain in neutral, get a bowl of popcorn and a coke and enjoy yourself. If you like action movies that have some humor in them and where the geeks save the world then this one is for you.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book really keeps you guessing from beginning to end.  A great read!  I didn't expect the ending and I'm not sure how I feel about it, but overall this book definitely held my interest.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a puzzle game where you slide a drop of water around a maze to collect pearls.

B008KMHFJY|3.0|Well, 50 Shades started me looking at these type of books and now I'm hooked.. I thoroughly enjoyed this \\"Disaster\\" even though it didn't have the \\"nitty gritty\\" of the others it had enough.  It had me interested from the get go. At one point I even cried. I hope it pulls you in like it did me :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Really good game lots of fun but the games are a bit boring after a little while all in all I like it
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book.  Hope the next two are as exciting. Very Sexy and Romantic. Have read it over and over again
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I love this show, it is done so well and has a great group of actors! Every episode is done with so much detail an character performance!
B005FHXB0O|5.0|best love story ever. the cast is superb. the dialect if great. just a fun movie overall. i recommend it as a must see movie to all of my friends, and i have yet to be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This story did a complete turn. I was quite surprised midway through the book. The end was a bit off, but I still really enjoyed it.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|I hate to think that anyone under the age of 40 has seen this movie. Young minds do not need to be influenced by this kind of garbage. Humans are now devolving!
B004LWZW6U|4.0|Just when you thought it was safe to go to your local water park, Anchor Bay Home Entertainment releases \\"Piranha 3DD\\" on not-so-innocent viewers. The follow-up to 2010's critically acclaimed box-office success \\"Piranha\\" did little business in theaters. Hopefully it will gain a little more attention from home audiences.<br /><br />A school of mutated piranhas enter a water park through its piping systems. The step-daughter of its crooked co-owner must find a way to close off the man-eating creatures' access to the amusement facility. The employees of the park attempt to rescue the thrill-seeking swimmers before they're devoured by the aquatic monsters.<br /><br />Roger Corman's name may not be found in the credits of this sequel, but his spirit is felt throughout it. It's the usual over-the-top creature feature we've all become accustomed to seeing from the B-movie king. Imagine \\"Jaws\\" if it took place in a water park the kids in \\"Porky's\\" worked at during the summer. That's the level of entertainment you get from watching \\"Piranha 3DD.\\"<br /><br />The CGI and practical effects are a grade above what one would expect from a movie of this nature. There are parts where the piranhas look less than spectacular, but it doesn't distract from the overall fun atmosphere of the film. Most of the special make-up effects are very well-done. The different severed body parts all look impressively realistic.<br /><br />\\"Piranha 3DD's\\" high definition audio and video transfer will satisfy viewers. All the carnage and mayhem is visually clean and crisp. The 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees you'll hear every scream of terror, hiss of a piranha, and crash of the dramatic music score perfectly.<br /><br />There's lots of bonus material in the 3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy edition of the movie. Audio Commentary with director John Gulager, producer Joel Soisson, and co-writer Marcus Dunstan is included.<br /><br />The featurettes are short but cover more ground than you'd imagine. The seven - minute \\"The Story Behind the DD\\" covers the making of the movie with cast and crew interviews. \\"The Hofftastic World of David Hasselhoff\\" is exactly what it sounds like: the actor discussing the movie and his life. There are also short featurettes with fan-favorite actors Gary Busey and David Koechner entitled \\"Busey's Bloopers\\" and \\"Wet and Wild with David Koechner.\\"<br /><br />Three deleted scenes give us more R-rated antics with Big Dave. The comedy short film \\"A Lesson with John McEnroe\\" is unrelated to the movie but still funny.<br /><br />The 3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy edition of \\"Piranha 3DD\\" delivers B-movie schlock in its finest form. I don't know how it could get any better (or worse?) than this. It's crude, gory, funny, and successfully self-aware. A great high-definition transfer and a few interesting special features make this a recommended buy for fans of Roger Corman creature features and the likes.magine.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|Rather predictable,and too filled with sex for my taste. Would have enjoyed more of a story line surrounding main character (christian) obtaining his wealth. Was hoping this second book would be better than first,I won't be purchasing the third. In fact,at this point I am 80 percent done with this read and don t intend to finish.
0525953728|2.0|As entertaining a read as this book may be, as well written as this book may be, the author has no business publishing such content containing the type of sensitive information that may be revealed in this book. This author is a SEAL, a person that rose to the challenge of a higher calling; the best of the best.  He took an oath to serve and protect his country and another when he earned his status as a SEAL operator to protect and serve his own community. That is a responsibility and obligation to other SEALs he serves with and those yet to come to keep their methods and tactics a secret; both for their own protection and for the overall effectiveness of the SEAL's in general. Especially these days. This book and his actions undermine the trust and confidence of the SEAL and Special Forces communities, as well as the unified chain of command all the way up to and including the President of the United States.<br /><br />Sure, many will read this book, enjoy it, applaud the author and the others involved in this particular mission. I too applaud SEAL Team-6 for their valor and courage in a job well done. Does that mean the ways and means should become public knowledge? Certainly not. There are reasons we do not know about units like SEAL Team-6 and other similar units. The public does NOT have a right to know.<br /><br />Guess who else is reading this book? Our enemies, both foreign and domestic. People that want to kill Americans. How will this book resonate in the Middle East? This will service to continue to help fan the fires of hatred towards Americans. and compromises the very forces that perform these types of clandestine operations.  Am I being paranoid? I think not. I am a former US Marine and know the value of keeping mouths shut and this flies in the face of many violations of regarding the community in which this author serves and how the Department of Defense, in part, protects all of us and conducts business. Give it ten or twenty years, then maybe therelease of such a book is not a big deal. Right now, it is a very big deal.<br /><br />This is my opinion and my belief. Once again, I thank the author for his service above and beyond the call of duty, as well as having the brains and guts to be a SEAL. They are all a very special breed of person, few and far between.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this.<br /><br />Semper Fidelis,<br />Don C.<br />USMC Once a Marine, always a Marine.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|These trilogy is great for adults! While most of us cannot relate to the situation these two are in, most can relate to the a love that is unbreakable.

B003NX76BM|2.0|I was a Nora Roberts fan for many years and got away from her books recently.  When I purchased The Search I expected not to be able to put it down, that wasn't the case.  It is a very slow read that I am still having problems finishing.  I would not recommend this book unless you are an absolute fan and will read any and all of her books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved this book!am telling all book clubs to read it.great plot and love the twist,can't wait for the next book.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|If you love descriptive reading this is the book for you.  The story is interesting but some times becomes bogged down with too many details.
B003UV8TFE|4.0|I haven't finished this book yet and I don't think I will for a while yet, and like any good read, I'll be disappointed when I do. I bought the book in the first place because I saw Walter lewin's MIT lecture by the same name and loved it. I've always been interested in physics and to learn anything new is always worth the time. With 'For The Love of Physics', Lewin captures his wonderful lectures in book form. His love of the subject is so obvious that it becomes infectious and I find myself eagerly explaining the science of rainbows to my wife. Although at times Lewin can go into a subject a little too exhuastively, you soon become used to the style and can skate across the superflous bits. Scattered throughout the text are various autobiographical snippits which give added interest. I think Walter Lewin is not only a very clever physicist, but a talented entertainer as well, not a common combination.<br /><br />A very entertaining and also interesting book, I hope he writes another!
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was great, but as always......the book was so much better, but they did an amazing job of putting as much into the movie as was reasonable.  The look of the movie was right on!  They captured the feeling of the book, did a great job of casting too.  I'm looking forward to the future series.  Even though it's a violent concept, it was done so you were able to watch and realize how awful it would be to live in a world where something like this could happen.  Not overly done (which would've been easy to do).
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The Hunger Games was a big hit with my kids and I have since watched it.  The movie pulls you in immediately.  Being a fan of the action genre, I did not expect the reaction I had.  It was captivating but the kids on kids was a tough one to take, especially for younger kids.  The movie was excellent.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Have been traveling overseas and have been amazed at the number of people I have seen in airports, on buses, around swimming pools reading one or other of the Fifty Shades books.<br />To me, it is the 2012 equivalent of Lady Chatterleys Lover!!!!<br />The story line got me in too...have to read the next ones.<br />For me they are kindle books.  And even then everyone is talking about them
B0058VW36U|5.0|I am 65 years old, but I still enjoy these little video games. I have since the old Space Invators. My Granddaughter introduced me to<br />Cut The Rope because she loves the little guy and all his sounds and motions. So do I! Playing these sorts of games relaxes me after a<br />trying day. I recommend it highly!
B003WC5EQI|5.0|Pulls you in and definitely doesn't let you go. I loved the beginning to this series. There is definitely a chance that I will watch this again.
B007T99ENE|5.0|Typically McEwan - a good read and effectively a two-in one tale with the intelligence services and an almost-literary-criticism interwoven with style.
B003WEY4P8|5.0|Pulls you in and definitely doesn't let you go. I loved the beginning to this series. There is definitely a chance that I will watch this again.
B000YAFE0M|5.0|You almost can't go wrong with Anthony Hopkins.  Ryan Gosling was brillant as an over-confident, rising star lawyer. Great screen-play. Sound track is wonderful.  Citizen Cope is now one of my favorite groups.
B003WGM40S|4.0|Pulls you in and definitely doesn't let you go. Then hits home with it's message.  I loved every minute of this series. Brought me to tears. There is definitely a chance that I will watch this again.
B000WLTKXK|5.0|Reily the singer, BB the blues guitarist, Mr King the showman-- all are on vibrant display in this must-have early collection. Feeding off an enthusiastic crowd's energy, this collection breezes along from song to song showcasing great backing musicians and, if you aren't already in the know, Mr. King's vocals, which may be a revelation. Exciting, memorable, a joy to hear. Buy it!
B005HSL626|4.0|Fruit Ninja Free is a game you can pick up and learn in about 5 seconds. The combo system gives the game a fair about of replayability. The between round ads are only slightly irritating and you can back out of video ads. Generally a fun little skill based game for your digits.
B0088X7YU0|3.0|First, I've been a long-time fan of the series -- not so much the last two live action films, but the pen-and-paper game, the books, the TV series, and so on. I had high hopes for this and it delivered the core elements pretty well. Lots of violence and explosions, bugs and people getting mutilated, and of course, nudity. The last bit seemed over the top for the first part of the movie, since there seemed to be like twenty minutes of nudity and sex. I mean, we got one shower scene and one sex scene in the first movie, short segments that seemed to make sense since the actors got to talk about some key issues like needing to serve to have kids and such. This was just nudity for the sake of nudity.<br /><br />Of course, the movie had top-notch CGI. I was very impressed with how it looked. I just wish the English voice acting was a little better. It was tolerable though, and I've definitely seen/heard worse. Overall, it was entertaining enough that I don't regret buying it, but I probably won't be watching it over and over again like the first movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|people are putting the book down, saying it's badly written, it's a fantasy can't people just get lost in the fantasy and take it for what it is. I am enjoying it, and there are a lot of lessons to learn from it.  mostly people can change !!!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Absolutely without a doubt one of the best written and enjoyable series of books I have ever read![[ASIN:0345529057 A Song of Ice and Fire, Books 1-4 (A Game of Thrones / A Feast for Crows / A Storm of Swords / Clash of Kings)]] A must read for anyone who loves fantasy.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Nothing about these headphones has disappointed me in any way.  The sound quality is great for games, VOIP (Ventrilo, Teamspeak, Mumble, Skype), and even music.  The mic is not intrusive when down and folds up neatly (and the auto-mute when up is great).<br /><br />The greatest feature for me is being able to bind one of the three G keys to Ventrilo's push-to-talk function.
0345803485|1.0|Wish I read the reviews prior to purchasing. I find it hard to believe a movie was made from this. Porn for sure. All the hype over this has me puzzled, no interesting characters, or realistic charaters, no plot and certainly no compelling romance. Very disappointed.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Bizarre.  Although the author is a good writer the text repeats itself far too much.  The story is bizarre and ending is uneventful.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved it! They could have developed the background history a little more though. Character development was good.  I hope that they continue with this series and develop the characters more.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book was a great sequel to the first four.  Hope we don't have to wait so long for the next installment.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|If you liked both the Outlander series (Diana Gabaldon) and the Twilight series (Stephenie Meyers), which I did, then you will enjoy this read.  There is quite a bit of historic information and almost too many pheripheral characters but I enjoyed this book and am two thirds through her second and still enjoying the story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is the most fun I have had with a new book in many years.  Have to think when I have enjoyed and looked forward to the \\"next chapter\\"  or should I say the next click?  I am reading on a Kindle right now.  A terrible confession since I am a retired English teacher of the old-fashioned kind.  Would it spoil anything to say it's such delightful stream-of-conscious, play-by-play, action?  The best clear-cut, no unnecessary verbosity, capturing the personality and mind set of each character, well distinguished one from the other. Lots of surprises, (not distracting) but ones you can't wait for the character to find out (because you already know!). Oh, the fun of it.  But this is not for the feint at heart.  No, not for a second.  Well thought out plot to the very end.<br /><br />That's all I'll tell you.  You have to read it for yourself.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is the best music finder app.  Just hold your phone up near a speaker and Shazam will find the song you are hearing.  It will also link to Amazon MP3 so you can buy the song.<br /><br />Well designed and easy to use.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Book 3 was literally overkill and painful to read. By this point if I read \\"laters baby\\" or \\"stop biting your lip\\" I want to throw a chair through a window.<br />I don't think any review would have stopped me from getting it just because I like to finish what I start when it comes to books but I seriously wonder why the author thought it was necessary to keep beating a dead horse with this portion of the story.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Such an addicting game, was so happy when I saw it got brought over to Android from iOS. Definitely worth giving a try, you'll find yourself hooked in no time
B007VDPE32|4.0|This is my first Rufus Wainwright CD.  I saw him on The Dave Letterman Show performing Jericho and decided<br />to download this CD.  The rest of the CD is descent, a little poppy for my taste, but it always takes awhile<br />for me to enjoy a new artist. I was also basing this purchase on how much I've read about him in various music<br />publications.  I will back track at this point to find an earlier effort to compare with this one to. If you're a<br />Rufus fan you'll like what I understand to be a real departure from his previous music. Of course my dealings with<br />Amazon was again accurate,prompt,safe and effortless.  The download went well and the sound of the songs are excellent.<br />All in all I am happy with this purchase.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really good book, an original idea I had not read before. I hope there is another series.  Now I'm going to order the prequel
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! Makes Pinterest easy to access and effortless to pin things. A must have for avid Pinterest users!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|The book is well written and amusing up to a point.<br />.Beyond that point it is merely variations on a theme, and too much of anything can be too much. It is not erotic, it is too explicit and predictable. I won't bother with the other books in this series,
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I managed to struggle through the first book. A friend (could be a former friend) promised me it was \\"like the greatest book ever!\\"
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has been so incredibly helpful in helping me learn more about my wheat sensitivity. It talks about more than what you can and can't eat. It eductates you to have a better understanding of WHY wheat could possibly be the culprit in a ton of your body issues. I've lost weight, have clearer skin, and feel overall BETTER since I've cut wheat from my life. It's definetly a lifestyle change but I'm never going back. Read the book and see how it can help you!
B008602KQI|3.0|.Not enough detail in the beginning, if you hadn't read the book you miss a lot of the story.  Otherpeople that watched the movie and didn't read the book thought the movie lackluster.  TOO bad because all three books were great.
0307341550|5.0|Loved Sharp Objects. The words just flew off the page. Couldn't wait to see how it ended and then was sad I had finished it. Can't wait for more by Gillian Flynn.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very Simple. It is a free app with an advertisement between each game. Good for a quick game before sleep or when bored.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Brilliant writing!  I love a book that is hard for me to put down.  Waiting for the movie!!  I hope there is one.
B007SGM084|5.0|I LOVED all 3 books! I started book one on a friday and finished the third by the following friday. I could not put them down! I ordered the set on my kindle fire and took it with me everywhere. I would reccommend these books to any adult. Honestly, if couples are having issues, just read these books instead of going to couples therapy ;)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I totally enjoyed that book.  It is the kind of book that you don't want to stop to read....!  The description of the \\"world\\" is very well done by the author.
B008602KQI|5.0|I bought this for my wife.  She is a big fan, but I have to say after watching it for the second time I seem to become a big fan.  I am now just as excited as she is when we see hunger games memorabilia at the store.  We are both very anxious for the next hunger games to come out.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this movie!! I would recommend it to everyone!!This movie is amazing and the cast was casted perfectly, I don't think they could have gotten anyone better to play any of the characters!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved all 3 books and couldn't put them down. Freed wraps up the trilogy nicely. I will keep these because I will read them over and over.
B00899DR40|5.0|My daughter can't get enough of Bieber she just loves his music<br />it is a mix of hip hop and pop what else could you say
B000IKQMFO|5.0|With a great ensemble cast, this film by Robert Altman is an outstanding film about the British upper class and how they lived may years ago. Written by Julian Fellows, the person writing Downton Abbey, the cast of Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith and Clive Owen (and others)gives the viewer a treat of an evenings entertainment.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Was probably better than the first two books, but I still don't see what all the excitement about these books are....
B006RUJST6|4.0|I enjoyed this work.  It is written for all ages from late teens and up.  Both genders also.  Plot is fairly straight forward and the storyline introduced me to a way of presenting personal creative works that I had not been aware of before reading this book.  Its an easy read and relaxing. I look forward to reading other books by this author.
1451648537|5.0|Terrific biography.  One of my all time favorites.  The author's examination of the complexity of Steve's personality and genius leads the reader to question judgements that have been made about Jobs.
B0015346OM|5.0|Factual,revealing and a true dispiction of of courage, humor and and who your brother can really be in the dire situations that war and its battles are really like.<br />God Bless the men in our Armed services
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Life of Pi is a fascinating story about a struggling writer who stumbles upon the story of Pi, the longest surviving person adrift in a life boat at sea.  Sharing a small lifeboat with a 450 pound Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker, Life of Pi is an unbelievable story of animal behavior and human perseverance and ingenuity.  The story is really too fantastic to believe and yet there is enough concrete proof to wonder if it may have been true.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I have to admit, book number 1 was so racey, maybe too racy. But I really enjoyed book number 2 and book number 3 a lot more than the first book. It wasnt so kinky, haha. But they say, this series will start the babyboomers again!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Good story, but really disturbing, though intriguing . There were times I did not want to continue reading. I felt the author went over board with the gross factor at times.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|You might as well skip this one - the others where on a totally different caliber! But still the same nice persons but didn´t get my attention.. to much Starwars going on!
0525953728|5.0|Very interesting read. I dont read much but I was able to get to the end of this book. The fact can be argued but it was a enjoyable read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed them got them all and told everyone to get them.  Need to find more books like these.  Love them
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm in love with this trilogy! Ironicly i don't usually read this type of books or novels . Im more Self-healing and metaPhysical kind of books! Read it! Is good entertainment
B008IEFJAQ|5.0|I love this album. I think it is full of fun songs that you can listen to anytime and everywhere. I honestly never get tired of listening to it. I love that with the Deluxe album you get even more songs to love. I would absolutely recommend this album to everyone. It is one of my very favorite albums I have ever listened to. I also have to edited version which is nice because then I don't have to worry about others hearing possibly offensive words, it is a win win.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I decided to buy this book because so many people were talking about it so I felt like I should read it too.  I must admit that half of those who I talked to beforehand liked it, and half didn't. After a few chapters, I desperately wanted to put it down and that really never happens to me.  I usually get so engrossed in a book that I don't want to put it down.  I am pretty open to a lot of things, but I was disturbed by the extreme lack of confidence of the main character and the overall behavior of Grey.  It all made me very uncomfortable.  I hate not finishing a book, but this just may be the first one that I will not finish in my life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|People who give this book low ratings it's as if they expect the book to change their life it's a fun read poolside or on vacation or on an airplane it is not going to change your life it is going to be fun to read!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book. I admit, it was hard to get into at first but then I couldnt put it down ! It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Definitely a book I'd recommend.
B008602KQI|4.0|Having read the book first, I was a little disappointed in the movie.  But it is hard to have every nuance of personality come through in the movie that can in the book.  The actors chosen for the parts were all excellent choices.  I could easily put them into the book and would be very comfortable with the picture created. I only wish they were accurate with the book. I am anxiously awaiting the second installment!
B007CEWR62|5.0|If you own other Secret Garden CDs, then you are familiar with their ethereal style of music with a celtic flair. This CD doesn't stray from that style, which isn't a bad thing. It has a quasi-Christmas feel, but you can appreciate these songs during any season. I was particularly intrigued by the 14-plus-minute Suite at the end of the CD. Beautiful and haunting. I think the weakest song in this collection is Powered by Nature, which has a beautiful melody but the lyrics can come off a bit cheesy. Secret Garden is at its best with the instrumentals. I highly recommend this CD.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very good quality blue ray video. Image quality was unbelievable. Product was received as promised. However,<br />the blue ray disk for Jaws I received had to be cleaned before it play.
B00633W614|4.0|A fun read with very good character development. While the story line has some questionable or hard to believe events it still held my interest.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was disappointed in this highly rated book; I consider it to be pretty poor hard porn, and would not recommend it it.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Action was good, action was pretty good, I don't want to give away too much for people who may not have seen it yet, but it's a good renter for sure.
B003QP4NPE|4.0|Fast paced and very interesting. It helps if you know a little bit about technology but not too much that you start questioning some of the assumptions.<br /><br />Well worth the read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I hate to say how much I disliked this book in the beginning but a little ways into the book, I couldn't put it down.  The beginning was more about each character describing their thoughts about one another rather than how a typical book reads.  It kept me wondering if that's how the whole book was going to be and I was very impatient with it.  That is why I could give it only 4 stars.  Once the story develops, your jaw will keep dropping at the twists and turns.  It is fantastic.  I'm definitely glad I didn't give up on it.
B00622B3MY|5.0|This movie is certainly more action packed than the original (which is a complaint of many), but my 6 year old son loves it more than the first and I'd say that it is certainly a close call as to which is better (the first one edges it out).  Lots of chases, spys, and gunfights.  It has all the classic spy movie themes (even a little romance, but nothing inappropriate).  I've seen a lot of complaints that the movie was too scary for a two year old - but who takes two year olds to movies anyways - that is just ridiculous.  I mean ignoring the questions of very young children and screen time (or even the appropriateness of the movie to that age) - why spend that kind of money on something they will never remember anyway.  The violence is certainly ratcheted up in this movie and others have compared it to The Incredibles - I think that is a fair assessment.  Commonsense Media rates the average age appropriateness at 6 and I would go as young as 5 depending on your kid.  Bottom line, boys will love it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I think 50 Shades is more catching, the story line is more exciting. Good book though, just waiting on the the next one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was the heart and the soul of the Trilogy. Once started I couldn't put it down because I really wanted to know the ending. I wanted to know who and how people survived. I wanted to know who Catniss would be with, Gale or Peta.  There were some surprises at the end and Catniss really surprised me with Snow. I highly recommend the whole trilogy, but don't stop with Cathing Fire.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just finished this book for book club.  Loved it.  about 1/3 of the way through I hated it and didn't want to pick it back up but I did and it was amazing.  gillian flynn really knows how to get her audience emotionally involved in all levels.  Very well written.  highly recommend this book!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|great movie cannot wait for the sequel. the story line is great and i love the lead actor.  he really makes you believe it is all real.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I can't ever get enough of \\"Walking Dead!\\" I can hardly wait for Season 3 to start, then I'll be watching it again with Amazon.com (in my jammies of course).
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|WONDER is for everyone...everyone who knows that kindness is the greatest virtue of all, and that everyone \\"deserves a standing ovation at least once in his/her life.\\"
B002KC8BSO|5.0|Rather low production values, badly written, cheesy special effects, no great performances here; but if you like campy Bruce Campbell movies, this is his best!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It's something different from all the others I have read lately.  I felt like I was going on the journey with Harold.  It was difficult for me to stop reading as I wanted to learn more about him and his past.  Try it, you'll like it!
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the books, the second one was the best one of all. The third and first were slow starter but they all were good. The third book left you wanting more. I hope he/she come out with a fourth book to complete unanswered questions.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Couldnt put it down, so glad there was a second book. The author keeps the story flowing nd i learnt want a slam is
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The way this book is written makes you never want to put it down.  The plot, however, is lacking slightly.  Character development is decent.  I bought this book because of the hype associated with it, but I will not be purchasing the rest of the trilogy.<br /><br />Buy this book if you want something different, but don't go into it with high expectations...
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|My husband read these books as a teen and was happy to see the movie come out. I was seeing with with fresh eyes since I didn't know there was a book it was based on.<br />My husband really enjoyed it saying it stuck to the adventurous nature of the book and I loved the the way it took me to places and times that didn't mesh but still really worked in the movie.<br />This was bright, exciting, and  I never knew what was going to happen next. We really did like this movie and this is from two people going in with expectations and no expectations.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book so much. I felt it was well written and I would definitely  recommend this book to anyone suffering from post Fifty Shades syndrome. I actually enjoyed this book a lot more than Fifty Shades. Eva and Gideon's relationship is different in many ways such as that Gideon is not super over protective over Eva and I like their communication. I would take Gideon anyday over Mr. Grey.
B002DD67XG|5.0|I really have a wide variety of music in my player and I always seem to go back to James Taylor when I want to relax and take stress off.  His music puts me at ease and helps me deal with life.  This Album is a good sampling of his best.
B004LROUNG|4.0|THE LITIGATORS is a good and entertaining book.  It's written with elegance and speed and there is never a dull moment in the reading. For those of us who know a little of the Attorney's world... it is a reminder of their twisted way of doing things, not always for the benefit of their client, but certainly for the comfort of their own bank account!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is really entertaining for my children!<br /><br />It is great fun and free is the best part! everyone should try this apply.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Each season, Castle continues to just get better and better!  Anyone who is a fan of good onscreen chemistry, great storylines and writing, excellent acting and fun should definitely start watching Castle. Season 5 is just around the corner and I can't wait!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I relented and ordered this book after countless people claimed that it was a runaway sensation.  Well, I should have followed my own instincts and kept my money.  The book is a major disappointment, at least for people who are accustomed to reading literature or higher brow books.  The story line is contrived.  The repetition of certain words is tiresome and, overall, the writing is neither captivating nor of the \\"I can't put this book down\\" nature.  This book is supermarket trash.  It is not sexy, in my opinion.  I give it one star as I approve of one thing.  It has somehow managed to intrigue women who otherwise would never read a book.  Many of my own friends and family who never pick up a book are reading this due to the sensationalism that has somehow become attached to this book.  I applaud reading and if it takes poor quality smut to encourage people to read then it serves a purpose.  If you are used to reading well written and intelligent books, this story is not for you.  Sorry, this is just how I feel...
B00499QUK2|5.0|I really enjoyed this retelling of the Sherlock story-verse.  Both principal characters are thoughtfully portrayed, and I think more enjoyable than the recent American movie adaptations (with all respect to those actors).
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Like many people, I love the books and looked forward, with some trepidation, to the DVD coming out.  So often books to film are changed so much that it doesn't even seem to be based on the book.  Yes, in [[ASIN:B008Z9YLV2 The Hunger Games]] things are changed and things are omitted (what's with Peeta's leg?), but so much is right on, that it is easy to forgive a lot of those little changes and omissions.  I thought the roles were played just right... not over acted or underacted.  Probably the only thing that I had to really adjust to was that Peeta did not look at all like I had envisioned him... but they couldn't please everyone and if Suzanne Collins didn't have a problem with it, then who am I to differ.
B00170GXWG|5.0|Great movie with good plot, wonderful cinematography. Great cast of actors and accurate depiction of life in the old west.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|I first watched this movie with my dad when i was a little girl(12) i am now 36. I absolutely loved this movie, and still do.
B008602KQI|4.0|Great movie, but if you read the book you'll be let down.  I was happy that the iTunes downloadable came with the product, not just the ultra violet digital copy
B007HC3LHS|5.0|At first, I didn't like the way the book jumped around. As I got further into the book, the jumping back & forth created suspense & I couldn't put the book away.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|The whole CD is amazing! The streaming quality is excellent an Bruno mars is awesome, as always. I will be buying his next CD as well!
B003UBTX72|4.0|This is a good inside look at the world's greatest rock band. Keith lets it fly and does not hold back. I'm also following the story with the Stones music.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was a little different from the book. All in all, the movie was still good. And plans to watch again.
B004LROUW2|4.0|Two people who met and fell in love in middle school find that their lives are intertwined.  Aomame steps into a parallel world - one where Tengo has written a novel which will threaten the future of a secretive religious group.<br />They finally meet and try to reverse their path out of the world but are they back in the real world or have they just entered a new world?
B0068LYEHA|5.0|This book is both funny and sad as it chronicles the many areas of suppression and repression of growing up female. that it leads to feminism is remarkable. loved the book!
B008CP92ZO|2.0|I thought this would be a great movie because Jennifer Aniston was in it. I also loved the title but the movie turned about to be weird. The character's character changed abruptly and it was difficult to tell if they were being sarcastic or if they really changed (for a few minutes).
B0011Z31V8|5.0|All of my favorite Prince songs are on this album. So many memories are brought back. Timeless music everyone should have.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Awesome movie with great action and fantastic visual effects! Watching in 3D was absolutely AWESOME!!! Highly recommended for any action movie fan!
B001A3GSJ8|4.0|really, this album makes for a great thing to howl along with in the woodshop.  no, really, you should try it.  feel free to substitute your preferred medium of construction or creation.  pop it into your headphones, make stuff, and howl away.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters truly take you in.  Like some of my favorite books, I feel like the end was rushed. The author goes through lots of detail throughout the book but I feel like she could have explained more in the end. Hopefully this means there will be a book 2.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I purchased this game about a week before it became FAOTD. It may be free today, but I don't regret purchasing it for 99&cent; at all. It's more than worth the pocket change.
B00493E1GI|4.0|This movie should make you pause a moment and encourage you to reflect on what is important in your life rather than continuously accepting that routine is life.  Humans are multifaceted; we're not just our job, parent, husband, or child.  We're many things, and it's important to give time and focus to that variety.
B008602KQI|5.0|I am always impressed with the service i recieve from amazon.com. My orders always arrive on time and in great condition. I so enjoyed the movie. I did see it on the big screen, but there were so many scenes I don't remember seeing. I can't wait for the sequels. I recommend seeing this movie, but you should purchase the books first (through Amazon.com)I did.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was totally inthralled with this book but so bitterly disappointed with the ending. I think the writer owes it to us to write an alternate ending and offer it for free through Amazon. Otherwise, I'm sure not spending my money on a sequel that could once again disappoint. The author should understand that her book is like a Charles Bronson movie where, instead of him reaking revenge on the maniac that slaughtered his wife and darling children, he makes friends with the killer and walks with him happily off into the sunset.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Worth watching,  but not as good as the first one.  Even still a worthwhile movie,  well produced,  well  directed  well  acted.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The beginner games are very easy. As you progress through the levels they require more concentration. Some take quite awhile to figure out. I spent a frustrating hour, at least. on one of them. I just couldn't get it. Finally it came together and I felt a great sense of accomplishment! It's the perfect game to occupy your time while waiting for appointments that never start on time!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Just a quick review of the quality, the show is awesome, dark, sexually charged and violent, but I am here to say that the HD quality is pretty good streaming from the Amazon Ap on my PS3, though I did notice it got kind of dark on some scenes, but this only happened when streamed, not when downloaded on my PC and played back, or on my cell. The price is also one of the reasons why I decided to not wait for this show to hit blu-ray, and I wanted to show a friend so that we could tune in for the second season! So overal nice HD picture and sound, great price, and I love the fact that I have a lot of ways to re-watch this show if I want since Amazon gives you multiple ways of streaming and downloading.
B008602KQI|2.0|I thought the movie was lacking in a lot of areas. I had read the book first which was awesome but when I saw the movie it went through the scenes too fast and didn't concentrate on certain areas that I wished it had.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is a great representation of the book: the director worked very closely with the author in the creation of the screenplay and the overall production of this film. Excellent casting all the way around, and I think Jennifer Lawrence especially fantastic--she's is a wonderful Katniss! And the story is well portrayed--can't wait for the next film in the series!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|A bit slow at first, not surprisingly - what is a surprise is how engaged you become as you get further into it. Really such an engaging read - & really fascinating characters & relationships who do surprise the reader - just like any great book. Also, I think, enlightens readers - that the divisiveness that is apparent in the public realm today is not the reality in the \\"Presidents Club\\", that feels good to know.<br />I'm  almost done & really look forward to each time I get to sit & read further. Highly recommend.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|First off, Loved Chis on the show, 'Stars Earned Stripes.' Thank you for your service.<br /><br />As for the book, I enjoyed the stories and hearing what Chris went through. However, I felt there was little continuity throughout the book and seemed to read very choppy. He is a Sniper not a writer.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I wish they had Mario for kindle but so far no luck.....Mario has always been one of my favorites.....a girl can wish for a kindle fire edition right, for now ill stick with this!!!!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|This book was is just OK in my opinion. I did not have any trouble putting it down to go to sleep. I don't read a lot of this type of book. Since I got my Kindle I've read Moby Dick, War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, Middlemarch and other classics so I may have been spoiled by the quality of that writing over the past few years. On the other hand, I've also enjoyed the likes of the Twilight series and the Sookie Stackhouse books, so \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" doesn't have a real high bar to get over in my reading-enjoyment metrics. Besides popular fiction and classics I'll enjoy anything that's well-crafted as a story and/or that has compelling characters. I'd enjoyed the first book in the series a bit more than this. I'd say that for real fans of the genre it's a pretty good read. I'm most of the way through \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" and I keep waiting to get more drawn in. It's a combination of an OK plot, decent storytelling and a pretty likeable main character that compel me to rate it a \\"meh\\" but not \\"ripping-good.\\"
B008JJM88Q|5.0|a really fun game thats hard to put down....once your friends see it, they'll want to put the app on their Ipad, Android, Iphone......really too much fun
B0035JRVR8|5.0|Always loved this movie. It's a classic. One of the reasons I wanted to travel to Italy.  I Went to Rome last year it hasn't changed much except for the traffic and the crowds. Great to see how it looked in the 50s.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|I really did not know what to expect from this movie, but must say that it exceeded my expectations, which is always a good thing. I love good science fiction and I appreciate the gift of those who create stories that go beyond my own imagination. Stories that take me to places I have never conceived and leave me wondering: How did they think of that? Thank you.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I bought this book mainly because I like mysteries and I love a good court case.  My oldest son just happens to be named Jacob.  I really enjoyed this book.  The court parts are sometimes a little long but nothing that would sway me away from the story... because as I said, I like lawyerly stuff.  You get a little surprised when you find that you are not reading what you thought you were reading (well played Mr Landay).  The ending is very powerful and leaves you wishing you knew JUST A little more.  This book should speak to the father and mother in you without reducing you to tears.
0375507256|2.0|Seems like either Cloud Atlas should have been a shorter than 500 page book or a six novel series, though I don't think any of the stories are good enough to stand on their own.  The five star reviews gush about the chiastic structure.  I was disappointed to hear Mitchell say in an interview he wrote each of the six stories separately, then split them apart in an hour.  I read the first two stories start to finish -in quiet revolt, but also for fear I would forget something important- and the last four his way.  I give it two stars because I find myself agreeing with all of the other critics here:  Comes across as pretentious, not a page turner, structure is gimmicky, characters are mostly cliche, and the style was laborious to read.  I kept asking myself if my problem with style was because I wasn't recognizing English words, but I think it was his use of metaphor and dependance on cultural references.  I guess that's what some reviewers are calling \\"genius,\\" but I've read other authors who don't make me feel stupid for not recognizing the references.  My favorite comment was \\"didn't walk away with a new idea.\\"  That's a stark contrast to how other books have made me feel...and think.<br /><br />He tries to reach at some of the driving forces behind humanity, but -and this makes ME sound pretentious- I think he's trapped in a pretty narrow contemporary understanding of reality.  It would make sense that each of the reincarnated characters would be experiencing the world through his paradigm but the book tries for more.  It's not just about his characters; it's about how things ARE.  His vision isn't magnanimous enough, and therefore keeps me from being drawn into it.<br /><br />You don't NEED that chiastic structure to write something profound and true about human nature, and it doesn't help him to communicate what he can't without it.<br /><br />Have to give him this:  I can't remember ever wanting to talk (or maybe complain) with someone else so much about a book.
B005721W9O|4.0|Good movie to just watch & enjoy! No high drama, no real violence, just a little goofy! Being Star Trek fans & have gone to a couple of Sci-Fi conventions we laughed about the craziness this movie depicts of some of those fans!
B00114RKT8|5.0|This is an entertaining, inspirational story of how one man can really change the world.  I don't believe the story or, even the name, of Wilberforce is well known in this country and he is an important figure in history.  The cast is terrific--Ioan Gruffrudd's (William Wilberforce) rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" is wonderful and a real treat from this Welshman; his friendship with William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his romance with his wife (Romola Garai), are memorable.  As usual, there are great performances by the British supporting cast.  The story, which is true, is well told with little sentimentality.  The settings and the costumes are luscious and add greatly to the impact of the film.  Everyone who loves \\"Amazing Grace\\"--sung at so many occasions--should understand why it was written and this movie, which tells the story so well, gives them the answer in an extremely entertaining way.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is a great album that is \\"fun\\" to listen to. Currently is my go-to summer playlist on my ipod.
B008KNZ4LO|5.0|If you like guns, martial arts, and alot of punch to the face, then you will not be disappointed in watching this show.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My 6 year old love's it  I downloaded it before our 5 hour car trip. It kept him busy for long enough for mommy to get a break .
B0012DP8A6|5.0|This movie is an all time favorite of mine, and I was devestated when my previous copy was scratched my an evil dog who thought it would make a good frisbee.<br /><br />This DVD doesn't have many thrills but it works well, and sounds great.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I expected more of the final volume of a series I had read avidly through 4 volumes. As the final volume I found very disappointing his wrap up of all the characters lives.  I was left feeling cheated because he merely<br />alluded to possibilities that might happen, not what did happen. Perhaps he plans another volume to tie it all together.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Fifty shades first part is something people prone to moderately adventurous sexual fantasies staged in a decent environment would like. Nice girl, dashing guy, upper-class life scenarios, with a modicum of middle-class modesty, something like the idealized life of a Barbie / Ken pair. Modestly analysed psychology, shallow depth of character, a little dose of feminism, stirred, not shaken. Smooth, quenching a certain type of thirst, like a decent lemonade. Two stars, and a half.
B003RT0NK8|4.0|I stumbled on this flick half way through on tv and found it interesting enough to wanna finish. Pretty interesting if not a tad slow. Definitely worth the few dollars to watch if your searching for something new to see
B007VGXS8M|4.0|I find this game to be entertaining because it has multiple options for play.  It is simple and requires good observation which helps keep my older mind sharp.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Too Cute, the kids love it.  We have had many laughs at Tom! Our favorite part is the repeat Tom performs.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I was disappointed with the ending. It seemed rushed and completely thrown together. The main character also seemed to lose a lot of what made her so likable in the beginning. I'm conflicted on suggesting anyone reading this book. The first half was a fun read and the second half I lost most of my interest.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have read them all hands down this is the best story ever. This is a world I could and would live in and thrive in.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|The entended cord for the earplugs did not work 1-month after purchase.  Cord began to short causing music to turn on without being selected; phone calls would end; callers could not hear me clearly through earphones.
B008M34CSI|3.0|Basically, it was just ok.  I thought it might be midiorce and I would be deleting  it, unfinished, but it was just ok enough to watch; only fast forwarded through a little bit of it.
B008M34INW|4.0|Mel Gibson is a great action actor and he does a good here, it seemed a little unrealistic at times but was entertaining ,if you like Mel Gibson it will be worth the rental.
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|A movie reminiscent of the early days in film. Actors did a good job imitating the silent film style and were able to portray the characters well. The plot line was predictable, but it was engaging to watch. An leading actor looses his career when talkies begin filming while an actress he helped becomes a star. She remembers his kindness and repays it. The dog stole many of the scenes. It is a film that everyone but the very young ( who like a lot of color, action and animation) can watch and enjoy.
B000UDJS2S|3.0|I was hoping this would start where the other left off however it was really different from the first. which I thought was much better, the special effects were great but I have seen Nicolas Cage do better.
B008602KQI|4.0|The will to protect your family, the power of love, the drive for survival all played out in this movie depicting the many facits of the human behavior.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it's an alright game. it's slow in getung nuts and you have to friend in order to complete some of the quests. so it's not really kid friendly.
B008EQIK90|4.0|This movie was funnier than expected. I liked that the old cast of the 21 Jump Street television series all had cameo roles. I also enjoyed the references to there being no good new ideas, and instead crap from the 1980s keeps getting rehashed. Fun movie, my wife and I both enjoyed it. The download from Amazon prime was nice and quick.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading this book! I can't want to watch the movie and read the next two books!!
B0026NBZDU|3.0|This novel started out gangbusters and kept me turning pages with unexpected plot twists and turns during the first two thirds of the book. I thought the characters were well developed, if slightly unbelievable,  and the plot innovative. I really loved the story until....in my opinion,the plot deteriorates into a predictable and slightly depressing mess.  I don't want to be a spoiler but I could see the conclusion a mile before it happened.  I did finish the book and did not feel it was a waste of time as I enjoyed the look into the Dickensian lives of both the lowest and highest classes in those times.  I am not sorry I read it but I am sorry the author could not achieve the excellent quality of the first two thirds of the work in the last chapters.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Pride & Prejudice is one of the best love story of all time, and my personal favorite. In this adaptation, Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen were splendid. Their passionate performance of misunderstanding and love, will leave you at the end of the movie in a state of awe for falling in love.
B008602KQI|5.0|My while family enjoyed this.  My grandchildren were so impressed with the courage of the two young stars.  They preserved their strong values and faced so much together. Great for any child 10 or more.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This is the second book I read by Gillian Flynn.  I liked it.  But, Gone Girl is by far my favorite.  I will be looking for more by this author.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book.  I was amazed about all of the hype surrounding the supposed \\"confidential info\\" supposedly contained in this book.  I didnt read about any tactics or technology you cannot also read in many other open source publications.  I think the biggest issue with this book is that it contradicts the \\"official\\" White House account, not that it divulges US Secrets.  Nonetheless, it is well worth it to spend the time to read this book.  Hearing about the operation's execution from someone who was second in line going up the stairs to UBL's room was amazing. Read it!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie version of The Hunger Games.  It was interesting to see how the producers transformed the written word into a very good visual work.  The movie did not excite me as much as the book series did, but I did like it and would watch it again. In fact, I ordered the movie right after I watched the movie for the first time.<br />That said, I would strongly recommend that everyone also read the Hunger Games books to get evey nuance of the author's excellent story.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good translation from book to movie - some differences, but overall well done.  I especially enjoyed the two outfits for Katness and Peata - the first entry into the arena \\"on fire\\" and the second in the personal interview in the flaming dress for Katness.  But, even better than that was the portrayal of how the game leader and team \\"managed\\" the playing field - the way they manipulated the fire, and the monster-types, very creative.  Can't wait for the next movies!!!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I have never been a Stephen King fan as I am a wimp and don't like to be scared when reading. A friend of mine recommended this book though, so I thought I would give it a try.  I quickly became engrossed in it and hated to see it end.  I still miss Jake and Sadie and it has been a while since I finished the book.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a wonderful book! A simple story about a simple man who never thought he could do much but went on an unexpected journey that showed amazing strengtn & courage and in doing so learned so much about himself. It was well written & hard to put down. I didn't want it to end.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|Top 10 Movie... for many of the big names in this movie, it may have been their best career performance.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the books and couldn't wait for the movie's release.<br />Great job on capturing the essence of the story and the acting was well done.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|I rented this movie because my husband said it was a great movie about 'salesmanship'.  But he couldn't remember the actual name of the movie, so I googled it and found it.  I was surprised how many famous movie stars are in this movie, from Alec Baldwin to Al Pacino.  Although Alec Baldwin has a small role in this movie, his famous line \\"coffee is for closers' is brilliantly delivered in the first 5 minutes of the movie.  The end of the movie was a surprise to me!
B008M87GJK|5.0|The BBC news app is an amazing product. One of the best aspects is that it provides International news that u might not get from US news services. The app also stores content you do not have to have a constant wifi connection. Just connect, refresh, and disconnect and you can still read the stories. All in all one of the best news apps
B003Q6CUAI|2.0|I decided to take a look at the Dukan Diet after meeting up with an old friend and noticing that he looked decidedly \\"fighting fit\\".<br />I asked him about it and he blamed the 19kg he lost on the good Doctor Dukan.<br />I've tried a couple of different 'eating plans' to get rid of the extra kilos that have attached themselves to me as I crossed into my forties, but with limited success.<br />I got The Dukan Diet on the Kindle, gave it a cursory read and dove straight in.<br /><br />3 weeks later I've lost 4 of the 12 kg I want to lose and I like the experience.<br />I've always been a happy meat-eater, so \\"all the steak you can eat and if you're hungry, have biltong\\" (A South African snack made of dried meat) was always going to work for me.<br />Cooking is a challenge given all the restrictions, but if you don't mind experimenting, the recipes in the book will give you a good start into the world of \\"Dukan cooking\\".<br />The internet is teeming with recipes and  short of a respectable cheese burger, you can make yourself just about anything you feel like within the very broad outlines of the Dukan Diet.<br /><br />None of which tells you a lot about the book.<br />I guess I can best sum it up by saying \\"Don't let the book put you off\\".<br />I don't know if something got lost in translation, but the book hovers somewhere between \\"engagingly straightforward\\" and \\"self-congratulatory pretentious\\", somewhere beteen \\"kewl\\" and \\"twee\\".<br />But that's a style complaint.<br />The content is well laid out, easy to follow and you can come to grips with the diet in a pretty short space of time.<br />You can get all the information you need and embark on your weigh-loss adventure almost immediately.<br /><br />While I'll give the diet 4-stars (that damned cheese burger), I'll give the book 2.<br />But then again, if you read diet books for entertainment, you're on your own.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Of the three, I would say this is the deepest in storyline. If you aren't reading strictly for the steamy scenes, you'll favor this one , as I did.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I thought this was an interesting sneak peek into the life of Anthony.  Had no idea he had been through so much and he still came out on top.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|I don't like apps that interrupt the game to ask you to rate the app.  I realize this was a free app of the day, but aren't they supposed to be identical to the paid version?  Does the actual paid version do that?  I was enjoying the game till that came up.
B008602KQI|5.0|Wow!!! This movie was very different, but I loved it. It is a must see!!  The acting was very well done. Lots of action
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is the best movie i have ever seen. Josh hutcherson is my husband and jennifer Lawrence is awesome. The extras are the best. Everyone should buy this movie!
B006RUJST6|5.0|Was a good book, ready to read 2nd one. I'm not a reader but it kept my attention and kept coming back for more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm obsessed with flow. it is so addicting and fun! Get it today you will not regret it! I love this game.
B008602KQI|3.0|I bought this for my girlfriend since she really likes the books and this movie.  I haven't read the books, however I thought this movie was decent.  The acting was alright and the story line was interesting.  My biggest complaint against this movie would be the action scenes.  I felt like I was watching Cloverfield during some of the most intense parts of the movie (for those who don't know, Cloverfield is a movie filmed via camera phone or camcorder so it is very shaky).
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great.  Read that it uses a lot of battery in a Kindle fire but the light fades away, the Kindle goes to sleep and you have to hit the power button to bring the Kindle back on, then touch the button to turn off the alarm.  Love it.  No power issues either, doesn't eat the battery up at all, but I do make sure it's charged when using the alarm.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this trilogy!!!!!i had been hearing friends talking about it and bought it out of pure curiosity,then I fell in love with the characters! I totally recommend it!,,
B0026O475M|5.0|If you have not seen this movie, you must give it a chance! It is a must see!  AWESOME! WILSON!!! What would you have done?
B000MD9UJC|3.0|Better than the original bulb but the [[ASIN:B000B868MK TerraLUX TLE-5EX MiniStar2 Extreme LED Upgrade for Mini Maglite 2AA Flashlight]] is much better and brighter. I bought one of each and the TerraLUX is, by far, a better deal. To get the Nite Ize LUC2-07 to light up and focused the flashlight head must be turned out to where the rubber O-ring is visible, and you need to tighten the head good and the switch that goes on the other end turned off to so the light doesn't accidentally turn on in your pocket. For  the price of the, though, it does work OK.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|THERE ARE CERTAIN ACQUAINTANCES OF MINE THAT SHOULD NOT READ IT. THEY WOULD FIND IT OFFENSIVE. THE PLOT WAS GOOD BUT SO MUCH SEX WAS REDUNDANT.  I SKIPPED OVER MOST OF IT AFTER THE FIRST FEW SEX DESCRIPTIONS.  WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ENERGY?!  PLEASE DON'T ANSWER THAT!  I DID READ ALL THREE BOOKS.
B003YTPS7O|4.0|This is a movie that my wife & I have watched many times. The setting is just magnificent and the overall mood of the movie is charming with a few darker look back on the main characters life. Russell Crowe does a really good job of keeping the movie going. The story is a bit weak but his acting and the setting keep the movie more than watchable.  Grab a bottle or three of red wine and enjoy.
B007XGJK4G|4.0|I thought I knew a lot about Bob Marley but th movie proved me wrong.  It was great insight into his character and what goes on behind the scenes. (the stuff I love).  I would only home that someone comes out with a video of a full bob marley concert (or several) :).<br /><br />Stillwtr
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found this book to be creatively written.  Certainly the subject matter was  more than a bit on the dark side, but it brought out so many emotions and feelings in me that good authors are skilled at doing.  Although the story in this book is an extreme example of lack of honesty and communication in a marital relationship, it does make one pause and wonder about one's own marriage and just how many secrets and bits of dishonesty are there.  It also makes one ask if some secrets are best left kept and some not.  The big question is then, which ones?  One of the few books I have read recently that did not leave me disappointed at the end.  It is worth reading.
B002VEB228|5.0|This movie is so much fun, that my husband and I have seen it several times. Each viewing, reveals more clues and fun discoveries. We reccommend it to all our family and friends.
030758836X|3.0|There is nothing I can add that anybody else hasn't said already. The end feels as if the writer was tired of writing and decided to butcher it...
B0011ZVVOM|5.0|What a deal, only $5! By far the most diverse band out there right now. White Stripes, Bad Company, Oasis, and their own sound all rolled into one. GREAT BAND!
B001BANK32|5.0|Possibly the scariest book ever written. Right up there with The Haunting of Hill House, Turn of the Screw and Hell House. No movie has ever done it justice.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I ordered this for my boyfriend. We watched the whole season in two days. We can't wait for the next season to start. :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Very well written. Started off great, quick read, and good ending as well, with some surprises thrown in. I like this author's style. Just started reading \\"Dark Places,\\" and so far it's excellent.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Watched over and over. Didn't expect what I got !! Heard book was better than movie. Can imagine then how good that was
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed every bit of this series and I can not wait for more!....i feel attatched to Christian and Ana its like I know tgem personally....i must say this series was very refreshing!
B000002J1U|4.0|\\"Led Zeppelin III\\" was the album on which the band discovered its very soul. The first album had benefited from applying a colossal rock sound to a blues sensibility, but too much of it sounded (and was) unoriginal. Songs like \\"How Many More Times\\" had been adapted from -- some would say just ripped off from -- classic blues artists such as Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon. \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" was better, showing more of the group's own personality in songs like \\"Thank You.\\" But it was \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" that pointed the way to the band's years of true greatness.<br /><br />And oddly enough, it seemed to put off some fans who had already come to depend on that thundering, bluesy hard-rock approach of the first two albums. \\"Immigrant Song\\" and \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" were recognizable enough, with vocalist Robert Plant finding his inner banshee on the former and drummer John Bonham bashing the living daylights out of kit on the latter. \\"Out on the Tiles,\\" which closed side one of the vinyl album, featured some aptly grungy riffs from guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones. But two songs on that first side hinted at something different: \\"Friends\\" and \\"Celebration Day\\" had a lighter, more ethereal touch.<br /><br />And when listeners flipped the album over, they might've wondered at first if they weren't listening to a different band. These songs were softer, craftier, far more exploratory than anything Zep had done to that point. \\"Gallows Pole\\" was a traditional song based on an old blues about trying to bribe the hangman, its eeriness underscored by acoustic guitar, mandolin and banjo. \\"Tangerine\\" would end up, years later, as part of the soundtrack for \\"Almost Famous,\\" and indeed there was something of innocence and youthful joy -- but also wistfulness -- in its sweet melody. \\"That's the Way\\" was about as stark as Zeppelin ever got: Most of the song is driven only by Plant's atypically quiet vocal and Page's strummed acoustic guitar. Jones' bass doesn't come in until the song nears its conclusion, and Bonham doesn't even seem to be playing a full kit when he comes in; I hear tambourine and bass drum but, if I'm right, nothing else. \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" and \\"Hats off to (Roy) Harper\\" both featured a bit more instrumental beef, with some electric parts from page and some odd, sweeping effects added to the instruments and vocal on \\"Harper.\\"<br /><br />It was great music in its own right. It represented growth for the band. And it set the table for Zeppelin's untitled fourth album, although it's often referred to as \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" or \\"Zoso.\\" On that disc, the four gents would perfect their quest for balancing acoustic and electric, light and shade, loud and soft. But \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" remains a favorite of mine. Play the last half on a misty day when the sun is playing hide and seek with the clouds. It'll send you.me in until the song nears its conclusion, and Bonham doesn't even seem to be playing a full kit when he comes in; I hear tambourine and bass drum but, if I'm right, nothing else. \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" and \\"Hats off to (Roy) Harper\\" both featured a bit more instrumental beef, with some electric parts from page and some odd, sweeping effects added to the instruments and vocal on \\"Harper.\\"<br /><br />It was great music in its own right.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I felt it had a slow start at the beginning, but toward the middle, I couldn't put it down. It was sort of like a murder mystery and I had to find out what \\"really happened\\". Enjoyed the book.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|great stuff!what a ride, surprises at every turn. I'm in my 60's and still think it's fun. Great character building, story, suspence and teeth gnashing 'til the end. Highly reccomend for the strong stomached crowd.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I think this is an awesome game and pretty funny and creative.  I really wish they would come out with a new version!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I love this \\"classic\\" book....you will too! I couldn't put it down. I'm sure I will probably read it again.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|loved season 1 can't wait to buy season 2 when I see it on amazon. the box set was in great condition no scratches.Absolutely buy from this seller again :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I purchased the Kindle Fire for my wife, Doris, for her birthday. She is the only one who uses it, but she uses it a lot. She is partially disabled and this has really been a blessing to her. Everything about this, books and games, have been a good investment.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|If you know the previous history of the main actors you can easily guess this is a comedy. This 2012 version has done a good job of remaking Johnny Depp's old tv series enough that he appears in this movie. Playing will depend on you internet connection so if you dont  like interruptions make sure you have a good signal
B005723JSQ|4.0|Great characters that were built up from the first chapter to the final.  But with that said, she keeps you captivated throughout the book with what the main character, Poppy, is going to do next and you cheer her on.  You want to go in the book and just wake her up and help her.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Well written and well-acted!  The cliffhanger makes me want to get cable tv and subscribe to showtime.  This season focuses on spirituality for Dexter and strange sexual tensions for Debra.  Debra's story line is slightly cringe-worthy but Dexter facing spirituality and fatherhood is pretty enticing.
B00846REIS|2.0|As others have said, this is a fifty shades copy, which is annoying. If you're going to copy something it should be because you believe you can improve upon the original. I did not see what all the hype was about for fifty shades- not a horrible book, but a three star at best. Fifty shades was sexually conservative to me- a few toys is not a groundbreaking exposure of any sort of alternative or rare sexual lifestyle. I must be in the minority with regard to that belief, but if you're with me on that one my helpful comment is this: Bared to You is much tamer than fifty shades. If you're looking for a scorcher this is NOT it. Two stars instead of one because something (I don't know what) compelled me to at least finish reading it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book along with the series were some of the best books I have read in a very long time. It was a book that I couldn't put down and just wanted to see what was going to happen next. It would be great if the author would write more books like these. Amazing!!!
B008602KQI|1.0|Not worth the money should have waited to come out on tv,customer review not accurate,next time I will  take a closer look  at other customer's opinion.
B008602KQI|5.0|we really enjoyed the hunger games and will watch it many more time in the future. It will become a classic
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie came out on a Saturday when it was Preordered so Instead of getting it overnight I got the movie on that Monday.But it was worth the wait.This is the best movie ever made.Truly a masterpiece!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been obsessed with Pinterest but when I was able to download it on my Kindle Fire it really went over the top! The app is so friendly to use on the go. I love it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't think I would like a book with killing, but it kept your attention else where. After reading the book watched the movie. It did not explain enough. Can't wait to start the next book.
B00846REIS|4.0|I thought it would be difficult to find something good to read after \\"50 Shades\\"  This book was great! I am anxiously awaiting book two. Great characters and an interesting story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wow! The training invested in these men and women is really grueling! I want to thank all of them for their service to this country! I also want to thank the authors for having the courage to write this book for the public. It gives us a new understanding of what it takes to get the job done with integrity and honor. We know in our hearts that the current administration (Obama's) practically ties your hands and then takes credit for the mission accomplished. This book is a must read! Good job! Now we are equipped to fight for this country and our values, i.e. God, Country, and Family, at the voting poles. I usually don't read this kind of action filled drama, but I was caught up from word one to the very end. It was thrilling to see how awesome our special op troops are and the extremes that the military leaders go to to protect them! It was disturbing to say the least to know how much the bureaucratic read tape puts lives on the battle field in danger! I am not surprised that the call to have a beer in the residence never came! This book will become a national treasure in the history of the war against terrorism this nation's troops fight everyday.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It seemed as the books went on the story seemed to go down hill. I was so excited to read the rest of the books in the series after reading Hunger Games, but I was a little disappointed.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Finally decided to watch this movie after having seen it in the theater and rented it a few times. I still laugh just as hard as I did the first time I saw it.
B008IEFP1E|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite albums Marroon 5 has made! I listen to it everyday, my favorite song is \\"wipe your eyes\\"
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Interesting story, but it contained too much of the original story. Also, there didn't seem to be very much 'mystery' to it.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|I'd never really stopped to consider this question before reading The Power of Habit, because habits are automatic and we don't think about them - that's why they're habits! But Charles Duhigg shows how habits can be changed when you find what's behind them.Some of his stories are fascinating.<br /><br />His writing style is very journalistic (he's a journalist!)but there's excellent content amongst the adjectival phrases.I'm currently rereading it and taking notes this time.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Am surprised to see this on the Free Ap Of The Day. I got both Quell games a few months ago, and love 'em. Fantastic and often brain-boggling puzzles with simple, yet smooth graphics.<br /><br />Hopefully the gained attention from today's giveaway will inspire a third Quell game.
B008602KQI|4.0|The hunger games is a decent movie. I wasn't a fan of how the post apocalyptic people were portrayed but it wasn't a deal breaker. The action and story line was right on. You really get to feel what Katness was feeling during the training and throughout her fight in the hunger games.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I kept hearing that this book was really good and finally decided to read it.  It was really good!  At first, I was shocked at the was he was treating her in general, but once I got past that, it was hard to put this book down.  I wish I had bought the trilolgy to begin with.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the trilogy and was pleasantly surprised that the movie was so enjoyable! I do not hesitate to recommend both the book series and the movie!
034580404X|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It was so interesting and gave me insight into something that I thought I would never be interested in.  I think that if more men read this book it would make them better partners.
B006K5RROG|4.0|I leave it to others to comment on the literary content of Arthur Conan Doyle's work.  My review is for the Kindle edition. This two-volume collection of all the Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels is a good buy.  Each volume has an extensive literary/historical introduction--the parts that I skimmed were very interesting.  There are ample and easily accessible footnotes that explain the meanings of various English and foreign words and provide information about the real persons mentioned in the stories.  My only complaint (the reason for only 4 stars) is the lack of page numbers.  However, navigating from story to story, or chapter to chapter in the novels, is relatively easy once you adjust to the fact that only one line in the table of contents is given for each one, which is often too short to be sure of its full title.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love Pinterest, but...the app freezes almost every time I log in. I have to choose &quot;wait&quot; or &quot;force close&quot; and I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times.  When I can log in I LOVE it!!!
B006O4UNAI|4.0|For full details, please see my review of the first volume of Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"complete Sherlock Holmes\\".  Thank you.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is an inspiring and interesting read about one man's journey towards running freedom.  The writing style is lightweight and fun.  The author presents facts from his point of view, but draws few conclusions for the reader thereby avoiding the tendency to preach so prevalent in many books of this type.<br /><br />All in all, a thought provoking book that challenges the notion of human as a week creature.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't want to say too much. Let folks have the story unfold for them as it did for me! So well thought out, from beginning to end. This book had to have taken a long time to get laid out so perfectly! I've been recommending it to friends.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Incredible action that whisks you across the globe.  The action scenes are well-shot and are very unique: the Dubai building is incredible and the revolving automobile display was a first for me.  Tom Cruise is still able to get it done as a believeable action hero and is fun to watch.  The plot is quite far-fetched (as all MI movies) but the supporting cast are all in and do a fine job.  I had a blast watching this movie with my family and highly recommend it.  This was definitely the most exciting and fun of all the MI movies.
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|The book itself got a little repetitive, but the information was well presented and made a believer out of me.<br />I am now on my 2nd week of the diet (If you can call it a diet....It's more like a guide to what is good for you and what isn't.)<br />As I said, I have been eating according to the book for two weeks now, and have lost ten pounds.<br />I have a nephew who was, to say the least, very overweight.  He lost over 90 pounds in 6 months. Additionally, we both feel a heck of a lot better.<br />Oh...forgot to mention there are no \\"portions\\"  you eat as much as you feel like eating.
B00165KRQU|5.0|Has the hits, no filler, exactly what I was looking for in this compilation. The sound is pristine for mp3 downloads as well. For five bucks you can't go wrong with this.
B00006GFAB|5.0|I'm not one for being very descriptive, but this KISS cd is epic. I listen to it all the time. Very happy with this cd and it's the perfect edition to my true rock collection.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The first book in the series is steamy & good. By the time you get to the last book it is redundant. The story is predictable and events could be played out to a further extreme. It is good getting to know a bit more about Mr Grey but other than that...... snooze!
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|Let me be clear. This is a solid piece of work by Linkin Park. It has some catchy hooks, some powerful melodies and messages, and can energize the dead. It also has slow pieces that border on experimental emo that don't seem to quite fit in with the dynamic barrage that is signatory of this band I have loved for years. Thus, 4 stars for creativity, for energy and effort.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read a couple other Stephen King books (not the horror type) and enjoyed them. I was eager to read this book when it came out because of the historical aspect and the controversy surrounding Kennedy's assassination. I was hooked from the beginning and couldn't wait to get back to reading after work each day. It is a long book, but it doesn't seem that long once you get into the story. I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but loved it otherwise.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was an extraordinary series.  The characters were ever-evolving - the setting magnificent.  I was sad when it was over.
B007SGM084|1.0|See Spot Run is literature compared to Fifty Shades of Grey.  This book has no redeeming qualities!!! Poorly written, characters unlikable, subject matter uninteresting and after reading Book 1 and 20 chapters of Book 2 looking for substance I gave up. It seems Best Sellers are a matter of sales not content.  Too Bad.
B000087DRK|5.0|Words can't be said to describe how much this album rocks. Every single song a home run. Just buy the damn thing already.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is perfect for any college student. I have my syllabus, school notes and even checklist.  It even syncs from my kindle fire to my  laptop, phone and desktop
B001KWR3PM|5.0|Mr Clapton's work tends to be virtuoso, emblematic and often painfully expressive of the complex experiences and emotional conditions of my generation.  It's a privilege to have this compilation to enjoy at our leisure.
B008602KQI|4.0|Excellent movie. Wish they could've put more of the book in it and shown more of the Games.  Build was a little long but great acting all around. Extra features were awesome.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I had a like/hate relationship with this book. There were some interesting tidbits (mostly coming from Cersei's POV) but for the most part this is the worst book in the series by far. Filled with uninteresting characters and plots (even the couple of well-known characters were lackluster,) the book seemed like a never-ending wave of \\"oh COME ON! Something has to happen eventually!\\" This book filled me with anticipation in wanting to carry on the cliffhangers that a Storm of Swords left us on, as I was skipping pages of humdrum conversations and repetition. I must say that I am glad that this book contained Cersei and Jaime because now we have more insight of what may come, and I'm quite looking forward as to how their stories pan out. Thank goodness for GRRM's little note at the end, because now I can't wait to put this book behind me and get cracking on a Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />First Line: \\"'Dragons,' said Mollander\\" (1, Prologue)<br /><br />Last Line: \\"Tyrion, Jon, Dany, Stannis and Melisandre, Davos Seaworth, and all the rest of the characters you love or love to hate will be along next year (I devoutly hope) in A Dance with Dragons, which will focus on events along the Wall and acros the sea, just as the present book focused on King's Landing.\\" (777)<br /><br />Quotes:<br />\\"Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, but only four had lived to manhood.\\" (23)<br /><br />\\"She dreamt she sad the Iron Throne, high above them all.\\" (51)<br /><br />\\"Arya never seemed to find the places she set out to reach.\\" (96)<br /><br />\\"How much can a crown be worth, when a crow can dine upon a king?\\" (138)<br /><br />\\"history is a wheel, for the nature of man is fundamentally unchanging.\\" (185)<br /><br />\\"We had one king, then five.

B000IEXVCC|4.0|Very well done. A David Lynch good one i really liked it<br />Good direction and good acting. Will watch again.. Excellent presentation.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great Movie to watch with your family. I love it and will watch it over and over again. I love that it had a digital copy to put on my Ipad, and a copy to watch online.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I have always liked modern greek mythology movies, and this one didnt dissapoint; it is packed with action, and although the whole theme of the movie is slightly weak, I think the action saves the movie
B0014EU5XI|4.0|Good cross section of ZZ Top- some I have not heard in years - I have not listened to the entire album yet but sure brings back some memories! Remastered cuts are always a hit or miss and you may find both on this album - but good backyard BBQ or road trip music if you are not a die hard.  All in all if you don't have any of your old ZZTop cassettes(or albums:-)this is a great collection to get you back into listening to ZZ Top -
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard this was a graphic S&M story and I put off reading it for 6 months. Then I went on a trip and had way too much time on my hands so I decided to try it. It is graphic but tasteful done. I read all three books back to back in 5 days and thoroughly enjoyed the evolution of the characters and relationship.  I recommend it for adults. S&M is a key part of the story, but not the central theme. It is too much for teens to be exposed to.
B006M6NUBC|1.0|Just not a good story, plot, or writing.  It was a waste of money and viewing time. I hope the sequel is a lot better.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game. I play it non stop all day long. I deffently recommand it for others to play it.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I have not read the book, and I have been told it is better than the movie. I guess for me, they hype surrounding this made me expect a lot more than what I saw. I plan to read the book now -- if anything, just to see if it is better.
B00846REIS|1.0|I thought I found another book that would be in the area of Fifty Shades of Grey, BUT, this felt like every word was lifted from Fifty Shades. I hated that I spent my money on this book. I wanted to throw my kindle across the room (I didn't) after reading it. Sylvia Day needs to come up with a better story and her own material.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the greatest book i Ever have read! 100% recommended! I cant wait to read the second one!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A not so modern day account of what could happen in not your everyday life :) But a great read, no slow spots. I loved it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game beautifully combines a simple yet challenging puzzle game with soothing and relaxing music. I find myself not wanting to stop playing because it is so peaceful.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a feel good story in a time of nationwide despair. The costumes are colorful and the special effects are unique. It will keep your interest from beginning to end.
B007MJSSCY|5.0|this was another big hit english movie but then again i am just a roll over for old english storylines. adore english gardens amongst english estates for they are movie in itself.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I loved this book!  I just flew through it.  I love when that happens.  I just could not turn the pages fast enough.  I loved his book Run also.  It is a fast page turner also.
B00846REIS|3.0|I was not crazy about this book.  It was ok.  I tend to like reading novels that leave me wanting for more and this particular novel did not fill the bill.
B00846REIS|5.0|Kept my interest, it was an easy read and enjoyed the book. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a nice summer book.
B003B5M0PO|3.0|I didn't realize before starting the book that it was written for children.  Even so, it was a unique (though perhaps sanitized) perspective of life before during WWI.  Using the device of the horse narrator the author was able to show that people on both sides of a conflict are basically the same.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was hooked on the series, I really didn't want it to end. Now I can't wait to watch the movie to see how the characters compare to how I imagined them. I was just sorry so many young people had to die.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is such a cute movie. I've watched it several times with my grandson. I love it! We watched it on Amazon Instant video and liked it so much I decided to buy it.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Loved this app. It had a lot of good sounds. I love being able to combine sounds and make my own noise to fall asleep to.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The product is really easy to use.  The numbers are big and easy to see, with the formula in the second line, I can see what my input are.<br /><br />The ads are not very intruding, so I don't mind.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|[[ASIN:B0084IG7KC The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]very sharp image and picture, the sound was just terrific, especial effects were awesome, good quality overall
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Missing the song Don't lose my number. I have No Jacket Required so it's all good.  Phil Collins has a strong voice and his music stands the test of time.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I read it several months ago and I can still tell you things that happened to Rose. Very touching and heart warming. Her story made me laugh and cry. Well done.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like this book because it tells you things that really go on in peoples lives. One thing for sure it will keep your man or husband with you and at home.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Decently designed game. Only downside is that it doesn't turn off your power-save mode. The music's okay, but the other sound affects are annoying.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is definitely one for your collection! The movie is really good. Not spot-on with the book, but it keeps the feel of the book throughout. Far better an adaptation then some of the other more recent \\"book to movie\\" translations geared toward the same target audience.<br />The casting for The Hunger Games was superb. It is very easy to visualize the characters progressing into the remaining two sequels. The characters are very human and approachable with the personality of each showing through. This is not a trite movie. It is entertaining and worth watching over and over again.
B00474IVGA|3.0|Love it. Just disappointed that all the songs from the movie aren't on it and really would have preferred it to have been sung like they were in the movie (by the actors & actresses) rather than by the stars. Would be a 5 star rating if it had those 2 things. Other than that it's great!
B000VUCIZO|5.0|Awesome view of the other half of early computer development.  Wozniak wrote the code for and put together the first personal computer unit...the keyboard/screen/processor...that made computers modules that everyone could experience.  He gives bit by bit details of developing the code for connecting the keyboard and monitor and flushes out the environment in California where all these young men were working on the future in their garages.  Very cool.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I did not know what to expect from 'Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One' except the writer was following the story line of Twilight and enhancing it the way she wanted it to be. Plus everyone was talking about it, especially the sexual narrative. So I began to read it out of curiosity.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The author of Fifty Shades writing style is 100% better than Twilight's.  The changing of the age of the main character, Ana, to a college graduate, instead of a high school teenager, having these experiences, is far more believable and far less unsettling.  Yes, the sex scenes are something else, but not any different than all the romance novels from way back when.  All in all, this book is an interesting read with compelling moments that make it difficult to put it down.  Even with all the joking around about \\"Fifty Shades\\", this book is worth giving a try.<br /><br />Oh by the way, I am an older mother of three young adult children and a reader of all kinds of books, including romance novels, all my life.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I read this as recommended from a friend and now I would like most of my friends to read it too.  It has mystery, fantasy, humor and suspense.  I didn't want to put it down and cannot wait for the next one to be published.  It is mystical and if you don't like that, you may not like it.
B0088WK27S|2.0|Terrible movie, the guy had good intentions but killing people for God? I guess if he tells you to. I'm not the judge.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I was rather sceptical on reading these books. I finished the last one a few days ago. It is impactful and exciting. I think the author is brilliant.  He touches his books with not so perfect characters. I have started reading the Red Pyramid with my 10 year old Grand daughter she lost her mother when she was 3. She has a 14 year old brother. I felt she could relate to Sadie Kane. It has been a real treat. I commend the author!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Fun and easy to read. Exciting twists and turns at every page turn! Couldn't put it down until the end!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|First I have to say the series as a whole was pretty good. Very different than what I expected. Despite the adult content, it's really not about the sex. It's about the relationship between the characters and discovering what makes Christian tick.<br /><br />I really enjoyed book one, and book two was pretty good as well. This one not as much. Probably because the 1st 2 books focused primarily on their relationship and this book was more about dealing with outside forces. Still, the series well worth the read.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Although it attempted to have a surprise ending, the book did not impress me all that much.  It was just a so-so book in all catagories.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Amateur effort in writing depending on shock effect to keep your attention  No redeeming value.  Would rate at One Star.
B008602KQI|5.0|Obviously, there are going to be things ommitted whenenver a book is made into a movie, but this movie was well done.  If you like the character of Katniss, you won't be disappointed; Jennifer Lawrence is incredible in this role.  I felt like all the other casting was spot-on as well, and overall, it is a great movie.  We are also enjoying the special features.
B00095NX9G|4.0|Rachel Brice is one of my favourite belly-dancers and this DVD is a good example of how good she is. Everything is well explained, yoga skills are very helpful not only for \\"serpentine\\" style, also for belly dance in general and, as always, she is gorgeous. I don't give 5 stars 'cause I think the video quality could be improved, but the rest is perfect.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran created a very engaging read, updating feminist theory while grounding it in real-life issues such as underwear, high heels, celebrity and shaving. She is at once self-deprecating and boldly confident that women have too many \\"how-to's\\" in our lives.<br />If anyone thinks being a woman is simply a matter of biology or psychology, welcome to a look at the cultural expectations and experiences that make us women.
B002M87V0A|5.0|I first saw The Music Man when it came out in the theatre. My parents loved it and I grew to love it as well. My favorite part of the movie was when the barbershop quartet \\"The Buffalo Bills\\" and Shirley Jones sang together with \\"Lida Rose/Dream of Love\\". I wish they still made movies like this...
B008JAGZDE|5.0|this was an excellent movie. It wasn't as good as the other ones. But I still got a lot of laughs from it.
B008602KQI|5.0|This DVD set was a gift for my friend's 14 year old daughter. I think her voice hit the range where only dolphins could understand her when she unwrapped it. My friend has since complained that she has no access to her TV because her daughter watches it constantly.<br /><br />I myself enjoyed the books more than the movie, but for a young teenage girl I doubt you could make a better choice for a gift.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie. It is super funny and entertaining for the whole family. Personally, it warms my heart because of the transformation that happens in the movie. Therefore, I believe there is a lot in it for the whole family to enjoy!<br />I am SUPER happy with the purchase. It would also make a perfect gift, considering the person receiving it does not own it already.<br />We watch it regularly. It is one of my son's favorite movies!
B008JAGZDE|5.0|Even though I did not get a chance to see this movie in theaters, I decided to buy it outright to complete my \\"American Pie\\" collection. Item arrived within the shipping window and as described.
B0083Z614S|2.0|This short novel was somewhat enjoyable and an easy read, but it had a very predictable story line.  I was waiting for some major revelation or surprise, but the action just quietly came to the expected end.  Then again, so go most of our lives, which generally wouldn't make for exciting reads either.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I knew from the first 20 seconds on this album that it was going to be amazing.  \\"Take a Walk\\" is my current obsession, I just can't stop listening to it.  That being said, the the album does not disappoint from there.  We all knew this was a talented band, but my goodness!  I can't remember the last time I was able to listen to an artists' entire album and really enjoy every single song.  You get that feeling at the end of every song like you're sorry that it's ending, but then the next song starts and it's so good you move on and just keep enjoying the music.  I personally don't listen to lyrics very often for a reason I haven't cared enough to understand, but I can say that this is a musically beautiful album.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was highly touted by several intelligent women that I know. So I opted to read Fifty Shades of Gray, Vol. 1....WOW! What a STOREY TELLER.  She introduces an idea or thought through one of her characters in one of the chapters, and then brings it to light in another. Just blows me away away! WHAT a future she has launched. I have started Vol 11 and I am excited Because Now we're getting into the heart of the Storey. Happy reading
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was my first read after Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to you. Much more mild, but I loved the story behind it. Again, I love bad boys so Travis Maddox was right on with me. If you are a good girl who loves bad boys, this is for you! Waiting for the sequal, Walking Disaster release in March 2013 I believe.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|It is a clear and very helpful guide but could be expanded to include formatting issues such as when you run into \\"hidden\\" commands in words and how to incorporate footnotes, just to give two examples. Appreciate it a lot that it is free!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is an incredible book. I could hardly put it down. I would highly recommend it to anyone., men and women alike.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  The movie is rated PG-13 for a reason and is not for children. The movie stayed true to the book, but left out the gore to to allow the movie to be viewed by the age group the book was written for.  Very well done.  Can't wait for Catching Fire.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome!!! Addictive and erotic all at once!!  It was a great love story. I read all 3 books within a week, once I started to read I couldn't put it down. Christian is an amazing guy whose world collides with the innocent, precocious Anastacia. From the moment they first met it was like love at first sight and their destinies would forever be entwined.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I watched this movie for the second time - mostly to see the wonderful Meryl Streep, but Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci all were great in it. I also enjoyed seeing the fashions, although I am not a fashionista. The story line is a little hokey but enjoyable anyway. Why would Anne Hathaway need that jerky boyfriend, anyway? She didn't listen to me telling her to dump him, so I guess the movie was not interactive. Watch this when you need a few laughs and some relaxation.
B00846REIS|4.0|I certainly enjoyed this book. It's a great love story that becomes more complex and jaw dropping as you turn each page. I am anxious to see how the perplexing love story between Gideon and Eva ends. Will they be able to overcome demons from their past to enjoy a future together?
B000Q79HS8|4.0|The movie was good.  I wanted to see it again before I saw the new one Bourne Legacy which is a great action packed movie but I miss Matt.  The only thing is I has some issues with the streaming that were frustrating.  I had to start it three times and skip over a part in the beginning because it kept getting stuck.  If it was a movie I hadn't seen before I would have been more upset.  I probably could have got it to the perfect spot but as I had seen it I wanted to get on with the movie.  This was in the first 5 minutes.  After that it was fine.  It is the first movie I have bought and streamed from Amazon-Prime and I thought it would be a little easier.  The movie was as I remembered.  Great trilogy
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It was a great ride all the way to the end! Eagerly waiting for the last two books, please hurry!
1609611543|5.0|I am on my second reading.  Intend to read it many times until I understand it.  This country needs to take wheat out of their diet.  It is most destrutive.  I have been trying this foe almost a month and I am most amazed. It is harder for me because I am a vegetarian.  I want to eventually get rid of my cholestro pills and hopefully,  high blood pressure pills.  I am on path back to health.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  It was a more expensive book than I normally read and that's why I haven't bought the sequel yet but, I would love to read the sequel once it goes on sale.  :)
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|I am a big fan of artsy movies. This one was pretty good, but not what I expected. I thought this would be a romantic comedy but it turned out to be less romantic. I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Real strategy.. real fun. Try new weapons.. Destroy all zombies!! Worth 4 bucks.. I surely enjoyed.<br />Also try to collect as many points as you can in between game. that will help you add more weapons..
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is a definate holiday read, ok for sitting by the pool with a Mai Tai but if youre looking for something thought provoking move on.<br />I kept thinking the author was a  bloke as there was a huge amount of \\"exploding\\" going on in relation to orgasms and I've never heard a woman describe it thus.<br />Gave me a few laughs though (not intentional) junk food literature, not good for you but you kind of want to try it again.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Loved it, can not wait till the sequel. Best movie I have  watched in a while. Kept my attention all the way till the end.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|read all of the many negative reviews..what kind of readers like this stupid book, no people I can think of
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci has long been one of my favorites for well written novels, with plots that hold my attention and are simply fun to read.  Amazon has been a superb provider.
B001EHDQFO|4.0|Engaging, interesting, reminder of basics in relationship and connecting with others. Well done and helpful. I would recommend this book to others whatever their profession. It can provide insights into all types of relationships with others.
0525953728|5.0|Very intense! I respect our country and our soldiers so much more now that my family and I understand how this was done. America is amazing, and ALL of our troops deserve more respect than ever! I highly recommend this!!
B008EQIA7W|2.0|I could not finish this movie because it kept freezing. The last several times I have rented a movie from Amazon they all have frozen.
B0083GQVOC|4.0|This movie makes you think about things most people don't want to think about, especially parents. I'm not a parent, but its pretty easy to see what is going on here. Sometimes people shouldn't have kids. Please do not have a child because you think its what you \\"should\\" do.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I saw the author on The View and decided to read the book.  Not at all what I thought would happen in the end.  Held my interest and I certainly hope the book continues.  Can't wait.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read all three books because everyone else did, but it was way too many \\"I love you's\\" for my liking.  The author could have made one fairly good book out of all three.  Some of the descriptive scenes were exactly alike from book one to book three.  I'm sorry I spent good money on purchasing all three.  I could have borrowed #3 from a friend and spent my money on some really good books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Entertaining for any age.  Played this alone, with my 12 yo, and my 8 yo on a long flight. We took turns.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is really handy, my older android tablet had a \\"dictionary app\\" pre-installed, now for free, I have an even better dictionary app, on my coby mid8042 android tab. I love crosswords so, I cheat, often, this is really handy.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|Brain candy - That's what I think of Sophie Kinsella's books and it's a good thing!  Sometimes you just want a good fun book that's not heavy and doesn't make you think.  Remember me is just the ticket but without the predicable formula that would make it boring.  Just fun.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|Like the title says it, \\"I Love Coldplay\\" and I can't deny it. Amazon MP3 is the best, I like how it saves the purchases on the cloud so I don't have to carry all my purchases with me to continue listening to them where ever I have access. I also like the fact that I can download to any device, so far I have not hit a limit. Amazon, you are the best!
B004EIZCPM|4.0|Funny movie and a good role for Emma Stone.  \\"SO SHARP\\"  Also Amanda Bynes does a great job and is also very funny.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is the best series of books I have ever read.  Once I finish one, I can't wait to get the next one and begin
B004LROUNG|5.0|Great read. Having finished reading this novel I immediately pre ordered. John Grisham's next book! If anyone doesn't enjoy this book, they don't enjoy novels!
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was close to the book and did not take away form what I know of the story.  The effects were also great, I love how they used the costume fire effects.  I watched it on streaming for free with my movie through Amazon and allowed me to see the movie on it's release to Blue Ray date.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|It's the best Gettysburg movie I've seen. Actually filmed on location. I've been there and it brings up many memories.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love it! it really works the mind! it for all ages well its a little for ages 7 and up at least but a great app! I love it! :)<br />all u do is try to get pearls by a bubble! I wanted it for awhile but didn't want to pay for it but now its the faotf! thanks amazon!
B0041VT6HW|5.0|Good flick thumbs up ! I have watched this movie 4 times and will watch it again in the futer .
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|Not exactly what I expected but it's still great music!!!! Not typical r&b but I Love Chris Brown! He makes great music.
B008M34INW|3.0|this is the kind of movie that you watch at home.<br />Very predictable, not very funny, weird plot...<br />Too bad because I like Mel Gibson's work.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|There are some funny moments in this film that had me really laughing. It was an okay enjoyable way to pass some time. But if you pass on this film don't feel like your missing out.
B008602KQI|5.0|I've read all 3 books and saw the movie in the theater.  Loved it so much I had to order the DVD.  It was received in perfect condition and right on time.  I will order the next 2 DVD's from Amazon as they become available. Excellent!!
B001JP5JRY|5.0|More than I tought it would be. Bigger and better, congratulations and thanks for my endless laughter during classes :P
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you're having trouble focusing elsewhere in your life and need a de-stresser, this book is all entertainment. Super clever who-done-it. Couldn't put it down!
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Found this great artist for only $5! This is likely the best $5 I've spent on music. I would recommend to anyone.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app my only complaint is that I have to force close pretty often. or it doesn't open correctly
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I found the books very interesting and mostly enjoyable.  The sex was very unbelievable....NO ONE has or enjoys sex that much!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome x 100. Every woman needs a little Ana and Christian. Escape from reality and read it! Its not smut its a good book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|An amazing look at what we are capable of in relationships... grabbed my attention from the very beginning and held on tight.  An incredible read!
B00122BERI|5.0|I only recently discovered Renee Olstead and this type of \\"torch\\" music has always drawn me. In this Julie London type sound I thoroughly enjoyed this CD and I am now a fan of Renee, If a soft jazz type sound appeals to you you won't be disappointed here.
B000FCJZ4K|4.0|Ferrazi starts telling us about his tough childdhood and how he built what he is now by talking to people and nurturing his network.<br />He tell us what techniques he used to achieve his every single goal.
B00138KEH2|4.0|If you are a Chris Cornell or Soundgarden fan, this album is a must.  Run, don't walk to your nearest computer and purchase it immediately.  :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Everyone said they wish the book had gone a different direction but I think this is the best way they could have concluded the trilogy. Very, very good read
B004NELBPC|5.0|interesting articles and good format.  Gets to the heart of the article without going on and on.  enjoy reading most of the stories.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I found the this book to be better written than the second, and less shocking than the first one. More about their lives rather than the moment. This was a good read. I enjoyed Christian beginning to open up and pull himself out of the depths of his past. Makes me salivate for the continuation!
B008OOYALE|1.0|the game started out cute, but you couldn't get very far before you have to spend money.  I understand they all need to make money but most games let you play farther in or at least let you keep playing. The game is geared more towards kids, I am an adult and thought the game would, at the very least, be a cute time waster...after all...who doesn't want to own a dragon.  Shortly after playing the game kept freezing and crashing.  I uninstalled it, tried it again and it froze and crashed again.  Permenately uninstalled.
B000IYU9HW|5.0|excellent. It captures the late 1960's and a beautiful and tragic love story of operatic proportions. Ali McGraw's best acting performance in her career. The on site locations at cambridge (Harvard ) were excellent. The direction and scene composition is what made the film so compelling. It is film my wife and I watch at least once a year since we met and were married the year the film was released.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great film, although I liked the book better. Very good visual effects and faithful to the original story. I liked that with the purchase of the DVD you also get a digital copy that you can keep in your computer/mobile phone. The extras are also interesting for those who are Hunger Game suckers!!
B001F8W400|5.0|My husband had to have this, he has watched at least 10 times since I bought.it. Thanks for keeping him out of the kitchen.
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie and extras were great.  Manufacturing of the product was uneven as at times the audio dropped off until it almost could not be heard.
B00760BPOC|3.0|A Dance with Dragons, part 1  . .  very few questions answered, a few new characters introduced, and very little about the dragons. I waited for ages for this book, Part 2 had best be more exciting. I didnt dislike it, just didnt think it was up to the standard of the previous books. Boring.
B0018CENUC|5.0|This is a great album for anyone who is a Toby Keith Fan.  It is also an album to buy if you want to sample Toby's various styles.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a music fan.
B002N7P23I|5.0|Esta versión original de la película Rec muestra una interesante mirada del género zombie, mezclada con el exorcista. Muy buena película y recomendada para los que les gusta el género.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|Great Movie!  I had to rent it so my 11 year old could see it, and she thought it was just as funny as I remembered it being.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|amazing character development. this is a moving book, it left me in tears, but in the most beautiful way. John Green is an artist with his words and his creation of these beautiful fictional characters that I always am left wanting to learn more about. great read, great author. i highly recommend all of his books.
1118156315|5.0|I think this book is a great piece to start with for finding value to your customers.  This book is easy to follow and is certainly an easy read.  The authors build off their business model canvas by flipping the focus from the organization to self.  What I found helpful was to look at the gaps I may have and build a development plan from those gaps.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. I am constantly on and liking or repinning things. It's really easy to use and inspiring really, I would recommend it. ALSO I like having it on my kindle! Its super easy to pin your pictures that you have on your kindle!  LOVE IT!!!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Fast reading, keeps you guessing.  I was totally off base in guessing the ending.  This book has a different twist that makes it very memorable reading.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love the Game of Thrones series! Each book is better than the last! The story is so enthralling and imaginative! If you like Sci Fi / Fantasy novels...I highly recommend reading this series!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|For a year I had been hearing from friends about Downton Abbey and didn't have a clue of what they were talking about it until one of them gave me the DVD of the 1st Season.  I was hooked within the first 5 minutes and proceeded to watch an episode every night and immediately ordered Season 2 so I wouldn't miss a night with the Downton Abbey family. Most engaging story, most engaging characters and actors and am counting the days till Season 3 starts.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book! This book is somewhat similar to the Fifty Shades series, which I loved as well. It was interesting and I love the different quirks of the characters. I am anxiously awaiting the release of the sequel!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|jetpack joyride is awesome and very addicting totally worth getting it should probably cost a doller do not hesitate to get this game
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Definitely a good read, although the Kindle version I downloaded had several spelling and other errors. Otherwise, I thought it was a good, easy and interesting read. Looking forward to the sequel for sure!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I truly loved this book. I found it to be incredibly eye opening and beautifully written. I have been recommending it to everyone.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|If you haven't read the book you won't understand a lot of the details of the story. I watched this movie with someone that had read the book and they kept having to fill in major details that I feel should have been included. I think the director crammed in all the action scenes and left out too much backstory and as a result the plot falls flat.<br /><br />In my opinion a movie based on a book is never as good as the book but a movie should be able to stand on its own merits and the bottom line is that The Hunger Games does not.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|So badly written. It's amazing where good marketing can get you. I wonder if her husband didn't have an agent whether this would have been published
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My kids and I absolutely love this app.  Would like to see more kids songs. Considering purchasing the other app.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Such a simple concept. Your character runs to the right, collecting coins as he flies around in a stolen jetpack. Throw in some vehicles, upgrades, different costumes and jetpacks, and you have an addictive game that is very hard to put down. Runs great on my Kindle Fire.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie recieved a day later than was it had been expected but still fast shipment, pretty good service.  Would order again
B0014EU5XI|5.0|A must own set from the little band from the big state!<br />You love ZZ Top, admit it. Well just hit play and let your ears enjoy and your mind wander with their inuendo lyrics! From La Grange to Doubleback and all the fun in between (\\"Heard it on the X\\" is one of my favs) you can't go wrong with this set list!<br />Some remix and live versions at the end add to the enjoyment.<br />If you are reading this, buy this, you can't go wrong with Ranch Texicano: The Very Best of ZZ Top
B008602KQI|3.0|Read the book and enjoyed it. The movie had me grabbing the remote to fast forward too many times. The next time they should cut through the slow parts.
B00846REIS|4.0|The novel seemed to copy 50 Shades of Gray. Although the women backgrounds are different there are too many similarities with the men. The ending was not great.
B008M87GJK|3.0|This is such a convenient app to get the news of the world in a nutshell.  BBC .... reliable and accurate, always. An easy way to read ...
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Not as good as the first and second book, I think it needed more of a story line to make for a captivating read... But it was still interesting.
B008602KQI|5.0|I couldn't take my eyes off of the movie.  Very exciting and dramatic. Movie wasn't in period I thought it would be in but better. I do want to watch again to see if I missed anything which I'm sure I did.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Reminds me of the old 80's stupid and over the top action movies. Guy Pierce is enjoying himself by the looks of it. Shut your brain off and enjoy. Good one liners and some decent action. CGI is bad in the beginning.
B008M34CSI|2.0|pretty cheesy movie dumb in alot of ways. Although it was mildly entertaining for the price. wouldn't highly recommend but if you've got nothing better to do not a complete waste of time.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I'll watch anything with Jonah Hill in it. This was definitely a good choice. The movie is funny from start to finish and still manages to give the plot enough time and attention. Definitely recommend.
B008JAG2AA|2.0|[[ASIN:B0039NCJFO American Pie (Unrated)]]<br />As with all other sequels to American Pie, it just doesn't measure up to the original.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Being a Pinterest freak, I was excited to learn about the Android-based app.  Well upon downloading on my Kindle Fire and my Droid RAZR, I've become even more of a freak.  It's easy to use and convenient when you're bored (waiting on my doctor's office, food, etc.).  If you're not pinning, you're not winning!
B008602KQI|2.0|The movie loses a lot of depth from the book, too much in this case.  There are too many unanswered questions on why things are the way they are - i watched this with some people who had not read the book and they really hated it. The movie is not as polished as it should be for it's big budget - some of the effects are truly awful.
B003TNM2ME|5.0|Best monster movie/drama you could see.You will want to own this one,so don't bother renting.Add this one to your library.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My Grandson and I have watched it many times over. He just loves it. He watches it on my Kindle when we go places. He will sit in the grocery cart and watch the movie and people comment on what a good little boy he is. It is because he loves the movie Lorax.
B007SGM084|5.0|Best books I've read in a while. Could not put either one down until finished with all three.  Will be recommending it to my friends.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to read and accurate wonderful reading. I would recommend this to everyone That is interested in reading the bible. Great application
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|Beautiful -- nature at its best.  The Disney Studios, through its Disney Nature series, are producing splendid documentaries about our living planet. With the successful release of \\"Oceans,\\" \\"Earth,\\" and \\"African Cats,\\" we now have the amazing \\"Chimpanzee,\\" an extremely absorbing and visually astonishing look at one of our closest relatives in the Animal Kingdom: the Chimpanzees.<br /><br />Even though the story of \\"Chimpanzee\\" looks like the monkeys were acting, they were not. The movie is the result of long and tedious hours of waiting with patience, and the effects of many other inconveniences while filming in a tropical rain forest. And, what we watch on the screen, is just fantastic, as the filmmakers were able to follow a group or troop of chimpanzees, and track their every move. In that way, we meet Oscar, a baby chimpanzee, who happens to be the star of the movie. We see him struggling during his early days, playing with his mother, learning to use \\"tools,\\" learning to eat, and more. In addition, we see the elders of his group, under the leadership of Freddy, a selfish, yet powerful male that really knows how to protect his clan. Of course, not every moment is happy, as we witness how these chimpanzees have to hunt and kill Colobus monkeys for their share of animal protein. And then there are the other groups of chimpanzees with whom they fight with -- at times until death -- for food, especially nuts, loosing their territory in the process. In this case, the enemy troop was led by \\"Scar\\" and his band of \\"thugs.\\" During the whole film, Oscar is the main character, as we see him trying to survive the daily struggles of life in the jungle.<br /><br />The amazing thing about \\"Chimpanzee,\\" is that while directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield were documenting the daily lives of the monkeys, as to see if they could film good material for their story, they also documented the most important parts of the chimpanzees' lives for us to know. We learn about their diets, their hierarchical structure, their good and not-so-good behaviors, aspects of their formidable intelligence, and their enormous capacity to love.  This is one film for the whole family to watch and learn together. The Blu-ray + DVD edition includes a making-of documentary, music videos, conservation documentaries, and more. (Tanzania / USA, 2012, color, 78 min plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on September 4, 2012 by Eric Gonzales for Disney Blu-ray.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app does exactly what I was looking for. I especially like. The easy to read controls whose buttons are big enough on the screen for my large fingers. I don't have trouble hitting two at once.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Characters matched book well.  Story seemed plausible, nothing too over the top. Some friends couldn't watch it; couldn't deal with theme of kids being forced to kill kids. Movie couldn't bring in all characters and details, but did wonderful job with main ideas.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The Alchemist is one of those books that has so many messages that it benefits from rereading it over and over.  The story is simple enough for young readers and the lessons are deep enough for accomplished readers.  Many schools include this in required reading.  It is short enough to keep from frightening a student.  I think this is a great book to read with your children though.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really liked this movie. I couldn't stop watching it until it was over. Yes it was long but it went fast.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|\\"Patton\\" is a perfect example of how great moviemaking and great story telling don't necessarily have to be rooted in fact. This is one of the greatest American movies ever made, withe several brilliant performances from Scott and others, great writing, breathtaking cinematograph, and a score that at times sends chills down your spine. This is truly great filmmaking. Unfortunately, it's also very poor history. The writers relied heavily on Ladislas Farago's biography and Omar Bradley's autobiography, and as a consequence, Bradley comes off almost angelic in comparison to Patton, who is portrayed as a foul-mouthed, near insane fanatic, and he was none of these things.<br /><br />George Patton was a child of the 19th Century, born to great wealth, who put all that aside in order to devote his life to being a soldier, and he do so magnificently. He actually used a chunk of his personal fortune to buy spare parts for the new US Army Armored divisions between the wars, when there wasn't enough government funding to keep them going. Those who served under him were almost unanimous in their their admiration, and those who fought against him believed he was the greatest general the Allies had. Bradley, by comparison, was often characterized as overly cautious, relieving commanders who showed initiative, and refusing the the British offer of specialized tanks (\\"funnies\\") in the Normandy invasion. His public image was largely the product of the writing of Ernie Pyle, who took it upon himself to lionize Bradley.  Unfortunately none of this comes across in the film.<br /><br />And yet... I still think this is a five star film. It's so well made, so excellent in every way, that I think the question of historical accuracy can be disregarded when judging it. See it, and enjoy it, but don't come away thinking it's a true portrayal of the characters portrayed.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I Love this movie, purchased for Kindle Fire.  One to watch more than once. Very very funny and thoroughly enjoyable!
B008602KQI|5.0|My kids and I all enjoyed reading the book series. It was also a really good first movie. That's not always the case with great stories you have read, and then the movie does not do it justice. This was a really good movie, too. Can't wait for the next movies to come out.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the books so I had to see the movie. I absolutely loved the movie! Yes there were differences from the book but I thought the movie did the book justice. Jennifer Lawrence was THE perfect Katniss.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|At first I thought the story was rather shallow, but enjoyed the trip through all three - with an ending I would not have considered at the beginning of book one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved all three books.  I liked that each book led right into the next.  Everything I like in a romance book.  The only thing I didn't like was the constant use of the \\"F\\" word.
B00846TRHY|3.0|The movie had good action. However, the characters cause was a bit over the top for me. Reminded me of Jim Bakker of the 1980's.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing. I would recommend it and its sequels to everyone. Action, romance, and drama.Everyone should read it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Love this.  User friendly, clear, precise. Even had a calendar, very useful. Like being to color code lists and the Checklist option. Better than two other \\"list' type apps, tried.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Fiction supported by reality. Love it. Highly recommended for anybody who is interested in technology and want a good thriller.
B006OOHYIC|2.0|Stops working after the first level. Game force closes after the last puzzle in the first level. It was fun while it lasted, but I am going to uninstall it. It did not work on Toshiba Thrive.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading over 100 pages of this book, I stopped reading!  There are far too many well written books out there that deserve my time and attention.  I found the writing mundane and the development of the plot so limited and vacuous.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Such a great read but ended too abruptly.. Didn't like the ending the author chose. It kind of left you hanging wondering, which maybe she was going for but I would have preferred more info! :)
B008602KQI|5.0|Love the movie as well as the books! I would recommend reading the books before watching this movie but it is an awesome movie all on its own.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down I just wanted to keep on reading very exotic and lovely. I definetly tecomend them all three it's fascinating!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The action in this book was crazy, in a good way. Love when a book isn't always about just sex but have other things that will keep you reading it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is really good and funny. Yes it has bondage and S&M but it is a really good book. I enjoyed reading it and will read it again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved how the trilogy ended. The background of Grey was very.... Interesting. One of my top 10 favorite books. Loved all 3.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you're not interested in what this SEAL has to say, don't read it.<br />If you want to criticize his motives, then save your self some time and just copy and paste your review to the other 30+ books wriiten by ex-special forces authors.<br />I read the book. It was very informative and believable.<br />It had no opsec worries.<br />It gave credence and praise to many factions of the operation.<br />If the author was trying to inflate his ego with this book, he failed.<br />If he wanted to give a first-hand account of his experience, he succeeded.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr. is at his best. Iron Man provides plenty of action, drama, comedy, and hidden in the middle, a love story, but nothing to over-the-top. I thoroughly enjoyed both Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 2 equally, nothing was lost on the sequel.
B004WKI204|3.0|I found \\"Bossypants\\" mildly amusing . . .  but far too long. It would have been fine in a brief story for a woman's magazine but Tina's life story is simply not sustaining enough for an entire book. Possibly readers in America would find it more engaging as they could identify with the people and TV shows she refers to. I gave up 3/4 through - just couldn't be bothered with such trivia.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I am sorry to say that this app, on the Android, is a no go. Not one thing can be printed from the phone, which is the only reason I liked \\"the other phone\\". It's a great app, I am sure, but don't know what to use it for.
B007MG360G|5.0|I get stuck on this game all the time!!so who ever says this is a bad game the are sourly. mistaken cuz I love it. I think I'm dun with this. I spelled dun wrong oopsy.and I no the sneer to wolf its dog and hyena there you go a head start.
B008XFB86Y|4.0|If you like Asian action flicks as I do...  You will enjoy this movie.  The quality of the film was good.  the sound was a bit spoty, but that may be my center speaker... Uh oh.
B008602KQI|3.0|The book was Sooooo much better than the movie. this skims across the surface of all the things that made the book such a great read. If you have not read the book you should prior to watching this film.
B008M36ER0|4.0|Did he really ever leave.  The guy may be crazy in real life, but I must admit that his films are a guilty pleasure.  This film is very entertaining and had an interesting premise.  It is always good fun to root for the bad guy.
B008RKPC9E|5.0|I only recently starting watching PLL recently. I started with Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix and was sucked in enough to purchase the first 10 episodes of Season 3 on Amazon Instant so that I could catch up to the current season.<br /><br />Critiques that this show are far-fetched and that the acting is occasionally sub-par are accurate, but the twists, turns, and camp are what make this show so fun to watch.<br /><br />The four main characters, despite being the title \\"liars,\\" each have their own set of flaws that make them loveable and while at first the audience wonders \\"why are these girls even friends?\\" soon enough the friendship among them seems genuine and you are on their side as they try to figure out who murdered their best friend and who the mysterious \\"A\\" is.<br /><br />Ordering this with the TV pass a great idea. I was able to purchase all the early episodes of Season 3 for a reasonable price and then cancel it when I was caught up enough to watch the new episodes currently airing on television.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I can't believe I didn't read this story as a child. The story moved along at a good pace, and I loved the way the characters came alive in my mind.
B007PKOKTK|4.0|This movie is a good one for little kids. My three year old and seven year old loved it a lot.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Quite a combination of pseudo history and imagination to create a world that pulls  you down through levels of human deceit and kindness
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This series is one of my favorites. The character detail is one of a kind. I could not put this book down. It's kind if annoying having to go through the other character chapters to get to the ones that I like the best but well worth it overall. This entire series is a must read and the tv series is excellent as well. One major downside is that I now have to wait forever for the next book in the series. I guess this type of masterpiece takes time.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|The ideas and advice of this book are so spread that you are probably already familiar with them. Every professional programmer should read this book and practice those ideas every day.
B000W94FE6|4.0|Great book, use it as a reference for teaching game design. Highly, recommended for anyone wanting to understand the concepts of positive psychology or how to design engaging experiences.
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games is the first book I have ever read from beginning to end (in two days) and I am 62. The movie<br />was wonderful and I can't wait for Catching Fire to come out in the theatre.
B006GNPP96|2.0|Women are being killed in a small Southern Community with no remorse shown by their men-folk.  A black, queer, racist, drug dealing, male prostitute is presented as a hero in the series. Just about every white character in the show is a worthless, crude redneck.  The sex is edgy but very brief, and the violence is brutal and unforgiving.
B005721W9O|5.0|I generally don't watch movies multiple times.  I take the time to watch this one every few years.  It's great.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Any book by Richard Dawkins is a great read, this one no less so; but even his impressive marshaling of facts will not seperate the evolution deniers from their ignorance.
B008JAGG38|5.0|Loved it.  After watching the first 3, it makes us feel like they're our old friends, and it was fun to catch up, see how they changed, didn't change, etc.  Fun movie!
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Wonderful movie. It truly shows the hard working Japanese culture. They really put their heart and soul into what they do. Not just \\"another job\\". Also lots of delicious looking sushi.
B00827OXJ2|4.0|This movie is still awesome after all these years. Near brilliance!! But wha t a travesty Olive Films has done to this clasic on blu ray. This is so insulting to such a great film. This is such a bare bones blu ray...to the point of making me start buying DVDs again! This is not Olive's first bad release. ALL of their blu rays are bare bones (except the terrible The Boogens gets a commentary!). Blu ray IS suppose to be the way to watch films at their finest (including special features). But Olive does such injustice to the awesome format! And don't side with them saying, \\"at least they are releasing them\\". There is NO excuse for their poor handling of their titles (Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 being the worst release of theirs).<br />But with my complaints falling on mostly deaf ears, the video of BOUND does look great!! This is the best it has EVER looked. The disc offers the theatrical cut and the unrated version with a few seconds added. I have had this movie on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD (although I chunked the DVD because it was unwatchable) and this blu ray looks spectacular. This is the first time (here in the states) that the movie is anamorphic widescreen! What a treat that is!! Just wanted the sound to sound better. No bass, no surround sound...but it could have been worse.<br />For twenty bucks you would think this would have been loaded with special features (at least a commentary from the awesome directors!). But it seems all of Olive Films blu rays are way overpriced for what little they offer. Sad way to treat a great hi-def format.
B008602KQI|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie at the movies but watching it home was awesome!! My friends came over we made some popcorn and some cocktails and enjoyed the hunt for victory.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Definitely helps to motivate movement as part of an every day lifestyle.  Convinced me that people were meant for long distance running/walking motion.
B003M30T9Y|3.0|Very Modern and epic...tightrope is the most(throwback)soulful song in this collection.<br />But it is refreshing to hear something (non-conventional) from a new artist.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. It has many variations and never gets dull. I play it often and never tire of it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it!!! After I finished the first book I immediately picked up the second one and couldn't stop reading. Anyone who hasn't read this series, Def needs to.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were absolutely amazing!!!! I read all three books in just 9 days. I was traveling out of the country for work to different areas of Mexico and I saw people reading one of these books every stop I made. I am begging my husband to read them. I would love for him to get a few ideas from Mr. Grey!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved it!!!! If you haven't read these books yet you Def need to. I hope she writes more cuz I can't get enough of fifty shades!!!!
0670022411|3.0|Initial Thoughts:<br />This has been on my wish list on Amazon since I got my Kindle a year and a half ago. It had great reviews, but as soon as I saw the word \\"vampire\\" I was turned off. It felt like everyone and their mom had a vampire book out last year. I went through my wish list recently and decided that it was time I gave it a try.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />It felt like this book was a mixture of Harry Potter, a romance novel, and a dash of Twilight. I think that's good? Pretty sure it's good.<br /><br />The historic detail in this novel was fantastic. I'm a big historical fiction fan, so this was awesome for me.<br /><br />Harkness is a fabulous writer. No Stephenie Meyer nonsense here. Her descriptions left you feeling like you were in the book, not just reading it.<br /><br />We read about vampires and witches all the time. Harkness adds daemons to this list. No werewolves. No fairies. No hobbits. Thank god.<br /><br />I liked the scientific aspect of this book. Taking supernatural beings down to a DNA level was fascinating.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />I was confused about the daemons. What were they really? Do they have a different lifespan than humans and witches? Do they live forever like vampires? What were their talents, other than being slightly inclined to higher IQs?<br /><br />The book had a slow start. Slow starts are not good for me. I tend to lose interest and walk away from the book. Luckily, I stuck with it, which was rewarding in the end.<br /><br />Diana is an intelligent woman (she DOES have a PhD in something fancypantsy after all), but she acts like a child multiple times in the book,<br /><br />Matthew was a bit overbearing for my taste. And I like macho men in my novels. So that's saying something.<br /><br />The Wrap Up: 3.5/5<br />I liked the book, but I think it could have been trimmed down a little. It was a monster sized book (just under 600 pages!) and I think the attention to detail, while good, could have been cut back a little. Less overbearing with Matthew, and more strength from Diana, and this book would have been perfect.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"My life now has a beginning, middle, and an end. Everything before you was a preamble. Now I have you. One day you will be gone, and my life will be over.\\"Less overbearing with Matthew, and more strength from Diana, and this book would have been perfect.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"My life now has a beginning, middle, and an end.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Freed was yet another amazing installment to the series. It kept you hanging on everyword and still left you wanting more!
B005YVSIZ4|5.0|This series is very entertaining and is a breath of fresh air. I can't wait for season 3, though I have to since it is not out yet dang!
B007VYDFMS|5.0|As a long time reggae and Marley fan. I thought I knew almost everything about Bob Marley. This film is the ultimate Marley biography. The soundtrack is great too
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Excellent insight into the men who have been president and their special bond. Great read. Really loved it. Highly recommend it for everyone.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this story and have shared it with both of my daughters.  I have grown tired of stories that revolve around the theory that once a girl gets the guy everything is happily ever after.  How refreshing to have a story about a strong female character who suvives the most extreme circumstances.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great writing. Kept me incredibly interested until ALMOST the end. I felt like the story could've ended one of a few ways, an I really didn't agree with the direction the author took. Enough to dock the entire book 2 stars. This was a 5-star read but the ending killed it for me.
B00285K1KE|5.0|Thank you for their services, I like superheroes of the marvel a lot and of the dc, besides those all the variety of movies and technological products
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Was a great read. Philippa does not disappoint and delivers the intrigue, the glamour and the gloom that was the reality of the times. You feel as if you are living it with the characters. Its a book that you cant put down once you begin.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Florence welch's voice is absolutely captivating and addicting.  There isn't a single bad song on the entire album!!  A must have for my music library!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|We lived through this era and found the story, warts and all, to be very interesting. Certainly very close to how we remembered from the outsiders point of view. Good job Walt.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is much better than I expected, even from HalfBrick.  I primarily game on a console or PC and don't care much for mobile games on my Android.  This is the exception!  Very quick and addictive game play.  I've also taken to playing this in meetings sometimes since it only requires a single tap anywhere on the screen to play.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I have to admit that I was pulled into this series, yes, I had my own eye rolls and laughing out loud at inappropriate times. However, I am a sucker for some cheesy literature, and this had its share of velvetta. The first two books, I enjoyed, in fact, I told my well read friend that she should try. Jury is still out on that one.  This last book was not my favorite, I wished it wouldnt have taken the road less rocky and became seedier, go into his life prior to Ana. But I do realize the author is writing for all kinds, just not my kind.having said this, if u have gotten to the final installment, your already invested to finish. Pretty black and white.
B004DZXC30|5.0|What an action flick.  You have to suspend disbelief but it is still a very fun movie to watch.  I would say it definitely deserves an A for Awesome.  Alright all obvious compliments aside, it has a really fun pace and Rampage does not dissapoint taking over Mr. T's spot as B.A..  I would say this is currently one of my favorite movies from the last couple years.
B008602KQI|5.0|Socialism is a society that has no middle class. Ideally it is supposed to put everyone on the same economic level, where there is no need.  However, the wealthy elite rule the poor, and do nothing but continue to tax and enslave them.  This has been seen time and again in socialist countries.  Yet, this is what our country has been pushing for in socialized medicine, handouts to able-bodied men and women who are able to work, and handouts (from our pockets) to people who are here illegally, and who do not contribute labor or money to our society.  We are a country of immigrants, and we welcome them all, who have entered to be  contributing, legal citizens.  The middle class is fading, along with our jobs, which are not only shutting down, but are being given away to others (mostly illegals) who are paid much less, even under the table, and who are not able to pay taxes.<br /><br />Hunger games is a sad, true, but intense picture of a whole society which is controlled by the wealthy elite.  They are so far removed from the reality of the private sector, that they assume that to be chosen to die should be an honor to the poor.  Fantastic movie!  Definitely recommend.  Amazon ships very fast too!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades Freed, book review<br /><br />I enjoyed the trilogy immensely, and book three the most.  Excellent story, and although the author has an unique style of writing that took some time for me to get used to, I grew to appreciate it.  These included the many asides by Ana, the female character as she described her reactions to Grey, her male counterpart and title character, and the conversations via email, both of which were essential elements to the telling of the story.  The sexual elements were quite well written, and as a retired professional in the field, I found the psychological development of the two main characters to be intriguing and credible.  I could hardly put it down and read into the wee hours.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|This was a good movie. It just kept going a good sat night movie to watch with your girl. I recommend.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is noted as a \\"small book\\" but it is really huge.  These individual tales about the Holocaust really personalize the history of that horrible time.  It gives voice to what everyday Germans were living through and more importantly how individuals tried to help Jews because they knew it was right regardless of the atmosphere.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This story takes place in San Francisco and the Bay Area and centers around one woman in particular. She has a very difficult background that makes her very leary of other people but she learns to love plants and flowers and to feel comfortable with them. Along the way she discovers that the Victorians used the symbolic meaning of flowers to express their feelings. We learn these symbols along with her. Definitely worth reading!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I am very pleased with this book.  It has enough thought and twists mingled with fiction and fantasy.  Good read!
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This was so well done!  What a joy to watch! We all enjoyed this! We had three generations watching it and we all loved it!
B004IF8TLU|3.0|The rental? Perfect. The movie? One I missed way back when, and it was a real slice of the 80s. Cheesy, predictable, yeah, but bottom line, it reflected niceness. How different. I LOVED realizing Vincent D'Onofrio was the muscular garage owner.
B007X4ECMI|3.0|How could you not be disappointed in this movie?  With the tags of \\"Luc Besson presents\\", \\"From the producers of Taken\\", and \\"Die Hard meets Blade Runner\\" you're bound for a smart, thrilling, and probably dystopically lush cinematic ride right?  Wrong.  You are taken for a ride but it isn't smart in the least and is rarely thrilling.  If you've seen the trailer then you know just about everything you need to know about this movie: renegade bad-boy agent Snow goes into earth's orbit to rescue the president's stupid daughter who finds herself trapped on a gulag-style space prison in the middle of a prison escape.  Guy Pearce, an intense and talented actor, doesn't bring anyting to his agent Snow other than snarkiness and flippancy.  And the way he can repeatedly take a punch to the jaw and temple and remain both conscious and coherent has got to qualify him for mixed martial arts!  The main villains here are an unconvincing brother team; the elder brother is the brains and the younger brother is the psychotic blacksheep of the family.  Early on in the movie, before you know of their relationship, you wonder why the elder doesn't take the younger out.  Later in the movie after this plot point has been revealed you still wonder why the elder doesn't take the younger out.  Also, the love \\"story\\" that develops between agent Snow and the president's daughter is also totally unbelievable (at least in how they screened it) and more than slightly misogynistic.  So with all of this bashing why am I still giving it 3 stars=\\"it's okay\\"?  Because despite the letdown it manages a peculiar style and psycho baddie younger brother plays for real but, most of all, because it generates its own winking cheekiness (at least I think it's intentional).

B005CMSDLE|3.0|The surprising sequel to Woody Allen's 1986 drama \\"Hannah and Her Sisters\\" finds our titular heroine out to kill those closest to her!<br /><br />I kid of course.  But that might have made for a more interesting movie.  I don't know.  This movie is about Johanna (Saoirse Ronan, doing a good job playing her part as a wide-eyed naif who has learned about but not experienced the world), a young teenage girl who has been trained to be a super soldier ostensibly in order to assassinate the woman who killed her mum and will kill her if she were to learn of her existence (Kate Blanchett, wearing a cropped red wig that rather suits her, and dropping in and out of a southern, Texas-style accent which is very distracting).  Hanna's educated and deadly father (Eric Bana as Erik Heller) trains her in the arctic, in a harsh environment devoid of distraction and requiring individual determinedness, self-reliance, and focus in order to survive.  When Hanna is ready to venture out on her quest and put her training to the test she crosses paths with not only her nemesis but also a contract killer and a free-roaming hippie British family, the daughter of which becomes Hanna's friend.  In the end Hanna learns who she is and why she is...a disturbing revelation that doesn't seem to hit her that hard and, because of how the movie ends (much like it started...I won't give it away) we are left to wonder what will happen to the girl.<br /><br />What makes this movie unique is not its female protagonist but her potential in the face of her lack of wordly experience.  There is a scene where she comes into contact with a variety of electrical items (light, fan, TV, coffepot) and it overwhelms her and she doesn't know what to do.  The scene is not played for comedy and has an unusual and memorable feel to it.  She also has some normalish teenage experiences with a Brit girl that befriends her and there is some tenderness played in these scenes.  Saoirse has a natural beauty that is on display and looks appropriately young, that is until she is put into light makeup, and then she looks like she's about to turn 20.  Also unique is the ending that takes place in a closed down theme park that feels surreal.  Blanchett's villain, Marissa Weigler, is dubious in that you can understand how she is the villain and yet at the same time the writers don't give her an underhanded verve or style with which to play off of and Blanchett doesn't manage a convincing style on her own.  Overall the movie doesn't mount to much but you may end up appreciating it all the same.  3.5 stars.and looks appropriately young, that is until she is put into light makeup, and then she looks like she's about to turn 20.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's essentially a super polished version of Helicopter. Which is really addictive and super fun. and its got awesome music
B005M5OSBK|5.0|I should have read the description before ordering.  Most of the songs were on other albums I already own.  There were a few unrecorded songs though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you want an erotic tale ...this is your book. But as far as substance and writing style...this book falls flat. Not an enjoyable read. I cringed most of the time until I couldn't bare to flip another page. I gave it a shot and it was disappointing for all of the hoopla surrounding it.
B003B02O7I|4.0|I liked the book.  It's different from the typical Grisham stories.  I got into the characters and thought the \\"moral\\" of the story was good.
B008602KQI|5.0|This Movie is Excellent. Jenifer Lawrence is amazing as Katniss Everdeen I loved Haymitch ( Woody Harrelson) and Elizabeth Banks played a good Effie Trinket You Don't want to forget Donald Sutherland As President Snow and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna The Movie was fun and action packed I suggest you buy The HUnger games It's good
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought Bared to you was an excellent book. I think comparing it to Shades of Grey is a good comparison. It was a very similar reading and I really enjoyed the book. It was well written and kept my interest throughout the entire story. This is crucial to me when reading a book and I felt this book met that expectation. I also recommend the rest of the Sylvia Day books. She is a great writer and I enjoy her style of books. Thank you for the novel Sylvia Day!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this series and loved the final book.  Once I picked it up, I could not put it down and finished the book in less than 2 days. I can only say I was disappointed when I was finished reading and had no more of these books to read.  A definite must read!
B003L77GH4|5.0|Amazing! This is the best show you can watch right now and every episode just gets better and better! I can't wait to see what comes next!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|SO much better then the movie. Read the book before you watch the movie. But absolutely love the book. Had to buy the second book the day I finished this book because I just couldn't wait to see what happens.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|This album is brilliant! So glad that Thomas Bergersen released something on his own. Very similar to the style exhibited by Two Steps From Hell which he is a part of. Appropriate for all occasions but I especially love listening to this while driving or studying. Great work!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put down this book, and I hated reading before these books. There is absolutely no comparison to twilight like everybody has said. Awesome book.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was pretty close to the book and intense to the last minute!!  Great acting and well played to the point of weirdness?
1476712042|4.0|A month out from finishing this book and I STILL can't formulate a proper review. There are lots of conflicting opinions out there and I'm torn between loving this story and hating it. A number of people are ready to sign their lives away for a night with Travis, the male main character. An equal amount of people are upset that the book was even published. Two extremes, but with equal amounts of passion in them.<br /><br />This story contains one of the worst types of relationships I've read about, but something, SOMETHING, won't let you stop reading. As an adult reader, I know this type of relationship has bad written all over it and I was able to enjoy the story with that understanding. To you impressionable romantics out there...yes, Travis Maddox is fun to read about, but I beg of you to RUN THE OTHER WAY if a boy (or girl) you're dating starts showing these types of behavior. This is not a healthy relationship in any way, shape or form. \\"HOT boy\\" NEVER EVER EVER means it's okay to put up with demeaning behavior. NEVER. If that is a concept you don't buy into, stay away from this book.<br /><br />It is hard for me to say how I feel about Abby, the female main character. As a woman, it makes me angry that she's ok dating someone like Travis to begin with. Woman deserve to be treated so much better than what she gets. Putting that aside (which is HARD, yo!) she deals with him in a pretty good way. She's a strong enough character to stand up to Travis and put him in his place when necessary, but then she negates that by eventually accepting that he just is who he is. YAY for acceptance, but not in this case. If I could just get past that huge obstacle, I'd probably really like her.<br /><br />Kudos to Jamie McGuire for serving up a book that I read twice in two days. TWICE. I could NOT stop thinking about it after I finished it and the only cure was to read it again. That helped tremendously, but I still think about this book many times a week. A book that leaves that type of impression scores high in my book every time.<br /><br />You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll read this book again, but I will recommend  it only in rare circumstances. How's THAT for a mixed review?hat type of impression scores high in my book every time.<br /><br />You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll read this book again, but I will recommend  it only in rare circumstances.

B0088TG252|2.0|I am more reviewing the download than the movie itself. I purchased it but it never showed up in my que. Disapointed. Wasn't sure who to contact. Good thig it was an inexpensive purchase.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|dawkins presents his views succinctly, with science rather than mumbo jumbo religion.  his arguments are cogent, intelligent and well reasoned.  anyone who is caught up in the religious ferver gripping the US should read Dawkins.  well, maybe not, the religionists are happy to be fleeced by their superstition.  i particularly enjoyed dawkins' explanation as to why the laws of physics (as absolutely proven) disabuse the believers into superstition of souls and ghosts.  i stand with dawkins!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible because it is very easy to use. it is also very User friendly I found it really justifying was God has done for us.
B000W1TIN2|4.0|If you're just starting with Sigur Ros, this is a good album to do it.  It's got some of their best music, yet it's not as weighty as some of their other releases which might bog down a new listener.  The track Hoppípolla is probably the best one for capturing the unacquainted.  After you've taken this record in, move on to ().  After that you'll be a lifelong fan.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I wasn't expecting to like the trilogy - I wasn't even going to read it but my daughter and some of my friends talked me into it. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. The bleak world of the districts and decadent yet oppressed world of the Capitol are painted so vividly I felt that I was there.  Such an original story.
B00014NE62|5.0|As expected from personal knowledge of Forster's work, this is a sensitive, timely, even for today's standards, portrayal of homosexual Love, philosophical, psychological, and physical and is buoyed, by the sense of romance it should have.  The 2nd disc makes it even more interesting in determining how this was achieved.<br /><br />As the truth and importance of this type of love works itself through the psyche of new generations in all the ways heterosexual love has, in the open and with considerations of genuine faith, and the truth of what is spoken of in religious communities within the considerations, especially of Biblical pronouncements, more and more, the world, I believe will see the distillation of love as simply love --  love which should be respected for what it is and not within shadows of what it \\"should be.\\"  After all, the Biblical proscriptions and pronouncements describing \\"abomination\\" as the end all and be all in considering the validity of homosexual love refuses to recognize the fact that the \\"Ten Commandments\\" does not mention this love, and it is the constant position of the \\"traditions\\" of men which is put forth to decry and judge, without the nuance of discernment and personal choice, a choice which even God gives to humans, and this film elucidates just that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The Pinterest App is the perfect way to see your boards and add new pins. With all the functionality of the full site, it is even better at the click of my kindle. I even like the kindle version better than the apple version. Thank you android!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I never get tired of playing this with my 6 year old grandson.  I even practice on my own before taking him on as I am not as good.  He always has pointers for me to beat a level.  Great fun!!!
B000QCS8TW|3.0|A good list of characters and left you thinking about book two.  I did enjoy some of the reading and believe I will read book 2 anyway.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I am surprised how much fun this game is. Got the first one too. Five five. Keep Em coming fallen tree.
B007SSDS24|2.0|I have to give it to them, the action was good at the beginning of the movie. But they didn't keep me interested. I don't know if it was the story line or what. I started going to sleep before I got half way in the movie. I hate that because I thought this was going yo be a great movie. :-(
B0086700CM|3.0|was great at first. now there is a serious lag and stalling going on. this causes u to die. wish they'd fix that
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent book!  An easy read and very interesting when detailing historical ethical issues in medical research and practice.  Also provides an interesting background story to the person (Henrietta Lacks including her family).
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie and the fact that it is in HD makes it even better.  The crispness of the lines and the action scenes are 10x better than in the theatre.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention that this is a great movie?
0679805273|5.0|love dr seuss books. bought two for my children starting kindergarten will have every teacher sign them and give to them upon graduation.
B000Y96EWK|5.0|This is an exciting, well-done part of one of the best action/spy series of all time. For anyone who has seen the first two films in the series, this third film is a \\"must watch\\".
0743486285|3.0|started off interesting enough but pretty much same story. i did drugs, played music, and repeat. If you ever watched behind the music on VH1 you'll pretty much sum up the book
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book is entertaining, and if (like me) you can't fully be satisfied before completing a series, check it out. However, the writing is elementary.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|After seeing the television program, I discovered that there was a book series first.  I bought this book to compare to the screen version.  All I can say is that it was better than expected.  The character development was superb and I am glad that the TV folks stayed close to the original characters.  I would recommend this book and am looking forward to reading the next in the series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is my first book from this author, and I went in without much knowledge of the book!  Very well developed, the author took care of every detail while letting you care and hate for some of the characters!
B008602KQI|4.0|I like a movie that will keep me glued to the screen until the end and leave me wanting more. I can't say that I liked the games they were forced to participate. I just pray that this will never happen in the real world.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|What a gem, I will definitely be buying this to have! I'm a huge Bob fan, and they really get into things that aren't common knowledge. It makes me see him, his music and family in a totally different, and yet beautiful life. He is dearly missed.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very close to the book, but lacked her thoughts. If you didn't read the book you wouldn't understand what she's faking for the cameras and stuff like that.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|This was a very dark film as the title implies, but a surprising one. Far from typical. I liked the actors they chose too. Not well known but recognizable. Fine actors. Who are they? You'll have to find out. Kiefer Sutherland plays a role completely unlike him. I loved it. Five years ago, twice. And twice again now. I recommend Dark City.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|It is a great movie. I am in my early 20s and I really enjoy it. Also the quality offered by Amazon is really good. I will definitely recommend the movie to my friends.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|The movie was as good as I expected it to be. The marketing was accurate. The actors were chosen according to their ability. Not a bad movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I found this trilogy to be a quick and captivating series. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys contemporary issues, futuristic novels and action/adventure.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Interesting reading, the saucy bits were detailed but barely believable and after a while, barely tolerable! We get that they do things to and with each other a bit different, sometimes less is more....?<br />The story of Christians childhood was most interesting and could have been embellished or added to.<br />But really, its a great way to pass an afternoon so not much to complain about.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Best album yet! Nothing else to say about it. In This Moment keeps raising the bar and exceed expectation every time!
B0055B7K7A|5.0|This movie is absolutely perfect for adults and kids alike! It is by far one of my family's favorites! It will make you laugh and cry and, in the end, makes you appreciate what you have. It's an instant classic!
B008602KQI|5.0|Catniss is the heroine of the 21st Century. The movie follows the book very closely and is non-stop action. Really, must see, adults and youg adults as well. Enjoy!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read!  After a slow start, it was hard to put down.  The female main character was amazing!  A totally unexpected ending.
B008602KQI|5.0|Wonderful movie and very exciting!! Keeps your interest from beginning to end. I was sad when the movie was over and the movie was over two hours long!!lol. Definitly a well worth purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this final book.  Please tell the author to write more like this book.  I truly loved it.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie and I was excited to get it on Blu-Ray.  The quality was great and we really enjoyed it!
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Despite a promising start and an interesting premise, this book quickly devolved into being merely another vampire romance, and do we really need another one of those???
B008602KQI|5.0|Love the visual effects in this.  The story is great, and I think they did a good job at following the book.  Can't wait for the next installment.
B0036OS3Q0|5.0|This is my first pair of crocs. I have yet to put them to the test in winter weather,<br />but in trying them on, they were very cozy and comfortable. I usually wear a size<br />8.5 so ordered a size 9 and the fit is perfect. I ordered the blue color and they<br />match the picture perfectly.
B00479SVBU|5.0|ATTENTION: I read in another review for this product that the little fuse that comes with this transmitter is for the plug that is inserted into the cigarette lighter. If the transmitter ever quit working, it might need a new fuse.<br />I love being able to listen to my music library or Pandora on my car stereo now that I have this device. It feels very solid and it's so compact, you hardly notice it. (Of course, I plug my phone into it so there's a cord that hangs between the two.) After opening the package, I plugged it in right away and was able to figure out the functions easily after reading the simple instructions included. One thing I should mention, it took a couple tries to figure out how to save the frequencies to memory; it is the same button to save it as it is to select it.  I don't think I'll need the remote very much, but it's nice to have.<br />This device is still brand new so I may update my review down the road to note its longevity (or possible lack of).
B00122HW92|5.0|This was one of the great superbands of the 60's and 70's and apparently into the 2000 era. The music of cream was visionary and futuristic. It brought back some dear memories.
B007P3S1AQ|5.0|6 thumbs up in our living room when we watched this- very thought provoking and deeply touching movie, with drama  and even twists, and exceptional acting. so very good! It is a heavy movie, dealing with death and an autistic childs process of coming to terms with the finalityof death, in a very complex situation. Even with the heavy nature of the movie - it was thoroughly enjoyed! When it ends you feel uplifted and rewarded for having watched the film. It is nice to see a movie and not feel as if you wasted your time or feel just mmmmya was ok ... My opinion is watch it!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I haven't read for at least 45 years and my sister land me the first book.  I could not stop reading and could not have enough of it!<br />Can't wait for the continuation of this romance novel!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book happy ending really do happen. Can't wait to read another book by EL James. She wrote a great trilogy to start her career off.
B000QRIGLC|2.0|great acts of bravery,but i get it . the seals are bad ass but i don't have to be told this continuosly.  references are made and then explained iike the reader has no clue. maybe i'm spoiled after reading shelby footes 3 novels on the civil war. reads like it was rushed into print. could have been much better.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|really fun! It looked like a boring game.... But is was so fun and once you start its hard to stop! Very addicting.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Great Rush sound___killer bass,guitar,drums,production,songs,this one of Rush's top albums. Maybe not the best in my opinion but it is at the top of my list of  good albums with plenty of listening enjoyment !!!  Rock-on Rush !!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very good read. Moves well with the story. A real mystery and thriller. Writer knew his story and subject. Wish there were more books by this author.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|The movies was great until the movie stoped for no apprearent reason.  Tried to re-start and then it would start and stop frequently.  I painfully made it through the rest of the movie.  I have FIOS running at 15 megs dowload. Although my Roku Player is wirelessly connected, I have never had trouble with streaming movies from Netflix or Dish TV.  This is not the first time this has happended with Amazon.  My suggestion, is that find out Netflex's process for streaming movies or even Dish TV's and copy their process.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />Very Disappointed (You can do better).
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Guess I'm just not that into red rooms of pain....It was a good read but not one of my fav books, it's not on my best seller list.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Wished there was more krackens but overall it was still a good movie to veg out and eat popcorn. Worth at least a rental and probably a purchase at the right price
B007V2UGPE|1.0|Long download time and I did not understand the concept.  Samurai could not get inside the door for the next adventure.  I did not like it took it off my Kindle.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book done. It has all kinds of twists and turns and a surprise in every chapter.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read mostly when I fly as the time goes by faster. Gone Girl is a book you won't want to put down. I am not yet finished with the book as I started the book on a flight and I plan to finish the book today flying back home.
B008XG1X18|3.0|just freezes way to much.  otherwise its better than using the browser.  if they could get that kink worked out id give it 5 stars.
B004LROUNG|5.0|He is a great writer - simular lawyer stories but content is different - always a surprise ending and keeps you from putting the book down
B006WPWH4E|4.0|I like to play this each evening.  The only part I do not like is the AD which appears and you have to SKIP.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Lots of information in clear, bold graphics. Simple to switch focus from town to town. Most importantly, the information and forecasts are quite accurate. Although it can be set to provide a longer-distance prediction, the Weather Live displays only three days, the maximum for a good forecast. An attractive and sensible app. Nice to have with you when you're traveling.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|low fat , small portion..didn't really get moving at any time , and the games seemed pointless...maybe the books were  more interesting...really worth 2 1/2 stars
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this book series so I'm biased.  This book continues the exciting fight for power in the Seven Kingdoms and it didn't disappoint.  New characters are introduced and beloved characters grow and sometimes move on.  I'm always surprised by the twists and turns of the plot.  I enjoyed this book as much as the first two.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I was enraptured with this book. I recently started downloading the free classics when I got a Kindle for my birthday; the dialect is a bit diffucult as the book was written in the 19th century; but the awesome thing about the Kindle is you can look the words up right off the text.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent psychological thriller told from two character perspectives.  Enough twists and turns to make this novel a great page-turner.  Worth reading!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|now reading your Bible is as easy as rolling out of bed. I love the plans that are tailored to specific needs or fir any point in ur walk - new Christian or just daily word. best Bible app ive owned in years
B005EWDA9M|5.0|Beautiful fiction.  The turns are unexpected but entertaining.  Can't wait to finish it and read it again or read another Murakami book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|simple yet entertaining. can keep me occupied for hours. enjoy the different. settings. I like that i don't always win
B008602KQI|5.0|Ok, this was the only movie that I paid to see 4 times. I liked the movie so much that I purchased and read all three books in the series. The story had me captivated. I finished all the books in about a week, and I'm not a fast reader. This story was moving. I laughed, I cried, and more importantly, I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel \\"Catching Fire.\\"<br /><br />One cool thing about purchasing it from Amazon... Even though I don't have my DVD yet, I was able to watch it the day it came out on DVD because Amazon gave me a free instant video copy of it.<br /><br />Kudos Amazon!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|So glad to have purchased this book. I could not put it down! Fun-filled and intriguing with a mystery that kept me guessing until the end. You won't regret getting this book. I'm immediately moving on to Twenty-nine Wishes now...
B007SGM084|5.0|This was my very first love story.  I started reading this without knowing it was indeed, a love story. I was told by a family member that it was a good book. That's it.  To my surprise, I didn't realize it was a love story until I was done with the first book!  I read legal thrillers and crime mysteries.  So, the entire time I was reading the first book, I kept waiting for the hammer to fall!  Never did.  But somehow, it was so good, I read the first book in one day!!!!!!!  I read all three in 4 days!!!!  They were all very, very good!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I haven't quite finished reading this book, but so far I really enjoy it. The pace is slow and easy going just like the setting which is in a small out of the way beach town. I have a definite picture of Alex and Katie in my mind because the author is very good at describing their personality as well as their physical appearance in detail. I would definitely recommend this book.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|A very interesting read and take on \\"How to be a Woman\\". Somewhat off putting to a man, but also revealing - at least of this particular woman. Bought it after hearing her interviewed by Terry Gross. Interview was tame compared to the book. All in all, we guys need to be awake to the stuff she talks about.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I have read all of the books and I have to say the last one is not as fun to read. I am not sure if it is because they got married or what. I still would recommend you to read it if you have read the other two.
0307887898|2.0|My problems with this book start from the title, \\"The Lean Startup\\".  To most people, a \\"startup\\" is a a new, small company trying to sell a new product in the market.  Unfortunately, that is not what Ries is talking about, and it is not until page 27 that he defines it.  Under his definition, it has nothing to do with the size or the age of the company, but rather with trying to \\"create a new product under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\\"  He elaborates in detail on the definition, talking about companies who don't know who their customer is or whether or not the product will be accepted in the market.  Examples of \\"startups\\" given by Ries include HP and Intuit: huge companies which have a long history.<br /><br />So what's wrong with that?  Well, really all of the examples he cites have to do with companies who bring out a new product after much careful planning, and the product turns out to be a flop.  This is really what the book is about, i.e. \\"What to do my company's product does not sell as planned?\\"  There's an important subtle point I am trying to make which is whether or not the organisation qualifies as a \\"startup\\" under Ries' definition is only known after the product is out and things are not going as well as planned, in which case your product meets the \\"extreme uncertainty\\" condition.  So new companies who make new products and sell them according to plan (and there are many such companies that have achieved success according to plan) are not \\"startups\\" according to Ries.  This sets up the perfect straw man for Ries to sell his ideas.  Simply ignore those new companies who are successful as planned (because they don't meet his definition of \\"startup\\" even though it meets everyone else's definition), and only criticise those startups who persist with traditional business planning after initial experiments fail.  In short, unless read with extreme care, this book misrepresents the benefit of Ries' ideas in comparison with traditional marketing practises.<br /><br />Moving beyond that complaint, I do believe his advice does have value once it is understood when it should be applied.  However, I do not like the way the material is presented.  There is far too much sales pitch before any content is presented.  The real content does not come until page 37.  From there, one starts to get the ideas, but the content is very sparse in a book filled with stories, some of which we never find out how successful the experiments were.<br /><br />In general I find a lack of objectivity in this book, sounding too heavily like a \\"sales pitch\\" without giving convincing statistics to show the success of his recommendations.  It is easy to show examples where a recommendation works and ignore those examples where it doesn't (\\"cherry picking\\").  This book does not go beyond that in supporting the arguments.  It's too bad, because I do think there is value in what he is suggesting, but I want statistics that do not misrepresent the reality.  Unfortunately, that is not the author's strong point.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm an avid David Gemmel fan, especially of the way he creates fascinating characters. Anthony Ryan's hero is easily as good as the best of David Gemmel. He is both believable and intriguing, and the world he lives in is as well created as anything of David Gemmel's.<br /><br />Honestly I downloaded this book because it was cheap and had decent reviews. Trust me the reviews weren't strong enough. I'd gladly pay full price for the next installment.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|I found this to be a very depressing and negative book.  I do not recommend to anyone who has an optimistic spirit.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Great movie I love Marley this movie should of been made years ago. Someone needs to make another one with a lot more of his life.
B008602KQI|4.0|The Hunger Games is a good addition to a book series collection. I myself have yet to read the books, but after seeing the movie, I've moved it further up my books to read list.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the book!  Eva's childhood was a total shock and yet to find out about Gideon.  Life isn't perfect and every relationship has it's ups and downs.  Just as in the book it takes working things through and trusting in each other!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I love this show. At first I was a bit skeptical, but once I saw the first few episodes, I was hooked. It is like a night-time soap opera, but with better acting. The drama, the backstabbing, the lies, with a little romance thrown in the mix...it's a good combination. I am glad I purchased the season on DVD, so I can watch it again before the second season starts at the end of this month.
B007BVJSLS|5.0|I am a huge fan of the books. I don't do much tv watching but was bored one day and decided to try the series. Great drama and very true to the books. At least so far. HBO has irritated the hell out of most fans by not allowing people such as myself to buy the next seasons. I think they'll live to regret that!<br />But as far as Amazon live streaming and related issues, as usual Amazon is on target. No compliants!
B008M36EEI|4.0|The story was a little slow to get started but I really enjoyed watching it.  I didn't enjoy it enough to pay to watch it again (rental or purchase) but if it was in the Amazon Prime collection (or Netflix), I'd watch it again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book one in this trilogy was riveting. I couldn't put it down! Bought books two and three as soon as I finished book one. Should be on every women's must read list!
0451228731|4.0|Fun Daniel Suarez book.  This was the first one I read and I'd still recommend it for those who enjoy computer software sci-fi.  The tech presented in here passes the bar of plausible, though of course it's still fantasy.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Amazon made me give this 1-star, although it is entirely deserving of a zero-star rating. There was nothing likable about this book or any of the characters in it. The writing was horrendous. The erotica laughable. What a direct rip-off of Twilight. Couldn't you have tried a little harder, E.L James, and at least have changed the setting. Oh right, that would require some creativity...and originality.
B008602KQI|3.0|I read the book first.  My wife has not read the book.  While watching the movie, I kept having to explain what was going on to her, as the movie left so much of the storyline out.  There's also some storyline liberties taken that were not in the book at all, but I won't spoil it for anyone here.  It's a well made movie, good acting for the most part, and cinematography, but the screenplay writers and film editors should be go back to school and retake whatever courses they missed or flunked.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was light and entertaining.  I read this after I read Something Borrowed. It was a great continuation and wrap of of the story. It was enjoyable to to follow the story of all the delightful characters in the book.  I recommend this book ....but one must read Something Borrowed first to really enjoy it to the fullest. It takes you through the entire story of when it all began.... and wrapped up nicely in Something Blue!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I bought this because I really enjoy HBO's adaption. I wanted to spend more time exploring the world through the book and I expected a far more in depth experience. I enjoyed the book and it does offer a larger scope experience, however, the TV series follows all the main points of the books very closely. I didn't really offer a whole lot more than I got out of the show. But I love the show so I enjoyed the book, just don't expect a ton more exposition if you saw the show.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|This album has a different sound than the last and I'm digging it! Not as mellow and gets you moving!
B005IQZB14|5.0|If you are a hiker (I am) this is a great read about a long hike on the less famous Pacific Crest Trail. If you are into human interest stories (who isn't?) you will love this book. For those of you like me, this is a must read book. Enjoy!
B004P1JEWU|5.0|The adventure continues and the ones you love suffer.<br />The twists and turns in the story are mind bending, surprise after surprise.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very well written.  Excellent research .  Just what we need at this time to counteract  our out of control weight and degenerative  illness problems.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I brought while they were giving out the free amazon digital copy so with the amazon video app on my EVO and my tablet and my xbox my whole family watched the movie while waiting for it to be shipped. when it arrived we put it on the self in plastic and all. we finally opened it and the features on the bluray is ok. the video quality is up to parr and So is the audio. the ultraviolet copy is pretty awesome. and the movie was overall a great buy for 20 bucks (the price of an imax ticket)
B0085776BG|5.0|This is a great movie about a unigue group of men in WWII.  I dont understand why the top billing goes to Cuba Gooding Jr.  He has a relatively minor part in the movie.  But it is a good movie and uses Computer Graphics Integration almost seemlessly.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|If you liked season 1, season 2 will not disappoint. Its all the same drama, heart, blood, guts, gore and struggle but just more of it! Yay for a full 22 episodes. Season 1 only had what, like 8 or 10...that was bogus! And there are plenty of twists and surprises this season...no one is safe!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|As I live in Alaska and consider myself a fan of Liam Neeson, I thought why not check it out? Now I can tell you why NOT to see this movie....in a word, \\"unrealistic\\" would be a good one to start with; the movie starts in bar at the work camp, there are no bars in or near the work camps (the closest one would be hundreds of miles away and one would not be able to bring a rifle in with you, like Liam did).  Spoiler alert, there is a plane crash and afterwards this group of men start a trek across Alaska, being so unprepared to survive it is amazing any of them lasted the first night, let alone a second.  The topography these guys cross is not the terrain one would fine between the North Slope (the oil fields)and wherever they were headed.  The acting through out this movie was lame.  Last, but not least, the wolf (wolves)...I have seen more realistic looking things from B-grade movies from the 50's.  If you like Liam Neeson and/or interested in what the northern part of Alaska looks like, this is NOT your movie.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was a sceptical on how the book was written, but after reading the book I can say that the format it was written in helps make the book very suspenseful and a good read, I recommend this book
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This is a good app for people like myself, I'm new to apps and tablets so this app really helped me finding mp3's. It couldn't get easier and I need it.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie followed the book in most ways and was well done. Hope to see follow ups in the near futture.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|I freaking love this movie. It's the best movie ever. I'm getting an Alice in wonderland tattoo great quality movie. I love amazon
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book had me hooked from the first chapter. I could not put it down and after finishing, found myself re-reading numerous times as I did not want to give up these characters. Travis and Abby are both strong character types that fight the relationship tooth and nail, not wanting to give in to their feelings. This turmoil frustrates the reader making you want to shout at them to listen to their hearts but makes the reader become more aware of their vulnerabilities. Shepley described them best when he called them a tornado. Jamie McGuire is a talented writer showing her wit with humor that caused me to laugh out loud and also made my heartbeat increase during certain scenes. She created real, believable characters making me anxious for the release of the companion book.
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|If you enjoy a fast-paced, action story you can't go wrong with Altered Carbon. Set in San Francisco<br />400 years into the future, the hero is compelled by an individual of power, money, and great age to<br />discover his killer. It is an action-murder mystery with enough science fiction to give the story<br />relish, but it doesn't leave the reader constantly second guessing the technology: It's a nice balance<br />of good storytelling and futuristic elements.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I actually geared up when he was reunited with his family.  And I felt for him when he talks about his teammates being killed and having to deal with that.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I haven't read much fantasy fiction in the last few years, but reviews on this title caught my eye. I must say I wasn't disappointed. The exploits of one of the most famous wizards in any world are a tall order to fill, but Patrick Rothfuss has given the wizard's tale a fascinating refresh. A compassionate and brilliant thinker spawned of a traveling troupe of excellent performers and musicians, the paths to becoming a wizard are fraught with audacious endeavors and sometimes painful pitfalls. I savored this story and I look forward to the next one.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the movie.  Could have seen it sooner if bought in the store.  Got free download on opening day but did not want to see as download.  Worth the wait.
030758836X|2.0|I listened to the audiobook.  It was one of those that made me want to not put it down...the plot twists were just great.  I liked it so much that before I finished it, I ordered the hard copy for my wife (she doesn't do audiobooks).  It came yesterday.  I finished mine today...and I'm left frustrated.  There were a dozen ways the book could have ended satisfactorily.  And then the way it actually ended.  I have another of her books on my iTouch...I'll have to do some more research before I invest my time on it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|excellent series and can't wait for 3rd season to start this fall.  the actors, writers, costumes and overall story line was right on.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is such a cool idea everyone should definetly try it. come on try it is such a great game!
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this movie! Great adaptation of the book although like all book/movie adaptations some minor parts are omitted. But the storyline flows very well and the special effects are great! I love Joshua Hutchinson and Jennifer Lawrence! Great actors and I can't wait to see them in the second movie adaptation \\"Catching Fire\\" :)
B005EGXTHG|4.0|I was a bit perturbed by the storyline, however was hooked after the first chapter. Really enjoyed the easy, though fast paced, style of writing. An entertaining read that kept me intrigued right to the end of book three of The Hunger Games!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it really helps remind me to recharge my battery when it gets low and tells me how long i can do certain things with the current battery level
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Absolutely loved this and the previous two Fifty Shades books.  Could be a tad more naughty.  Learned a lot from these books.  Can't wait for more ...
B001NLKT60|5.0|Excellent reading.  A variety of intertwined story lines that are well constructed and often not predictable.  The book continues to go down unexpected paths.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calcaulator to use on my math homework the other day but I couldn't find one so I downloaded this app. it works really well! you'll never forget where you are in an equation so its hard to get it wrong! if you're a student that actually gets homework this is the app for you!
B0068LYEHA|3.0|After hearing Ms. Moran's interview on Fresh Air, I couldn't wait to read her book and ordered it right away from Amazon. Unfortunately, the interview used all the funny bits. Although I agree thoroughly with her conclusions, we come from different generations and I was unable to really relate to her personal experiences. Towards the end I began simply skimming and never really finished.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great plot and very good acting. Not appropriate for children under the age of 15 or very sensitive children as the thought of children killing children for the amusement of adults it not one to which I would subject young children. All in all though a gripping look at government gone amuck. A modern day decadent Roman culture movie.
B007F7XXKA|5.0|agree with the quote from Bloomberg - \\"Breakout Nations is basically an investors lonely planet guide to the world for the new century.\\" (Bloomberg \\"On the Economy\\" )\\"
B0027MJU00|3.0|Very original plot with lots of description for characters as well as events.  There is not much to like about main character Libby, but as she is motivated to find out the truth about the night her family was killed, I found myself trapped until the end to learn \\"who done it.\\"  Other characters are just as unlikeable, would have been nice to have maybe one person with pure motives, likeability.  The relationship between Ben and his girlfriend was way to bazzar for me but I keep reading to see how all would end.  Very well written as far as keeping events in order, keeping reader hooked.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent writing, plot, story line, acting, costumes and setting. May be the best mini series in TV history; the Brits really know how to produce great TV drama! & as always Amazon delivered!!
B000ICXQGK|5.0|I loved this movie! Imaging was fantastic. The meaning behind everything was really interesting. I plan to buy this movie for my collection.
B008602KQI|2.0|The movie was well made, exciting and a little bizarre, but the biggest impact it had on me was a theme of children killing other children for the entertainment of the elite classes, and to win food for their very deprived colony, was disturbing at best.  Ultimately the victory of a representative of the \\"mining colony\\" which they go to great lengths to have all colonies other than colony one (whose children are trained for the games their entire lives), is rewarding, but the movie ends with the evil leader of the planet upset over her victory, and you know it's only going to get worse in sequels.  I will never watch it again, because the images of children killing other children, primarily for the entertainment of the ruling/elite classes was so upsetting that I don't consider that to be \\"entertainment\\" that I enjoy and would watch ever again.[[ASIN:B0084IG7KC The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
B008K3HRF0|5.0|We were camping and it started to rain so 5 kids were in our camper and they all agreed on a movie!  I bought it off Amazon Prime and they settled in to watch it. The kid's ages ranged from 6-10 and they were all happy to be watching the movie.  No one was bored or thought it was too babyish.  I highly recommend The Lorax for all ages.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Lots of fun and informative. Nice that one can customize to own interests, BUT! Not formatted for tablets,display very fuzzy on ASUS Transformer, but excellent on Droid RAZR.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|the voices nd accents could use some work but best game ive played on my kindle yet.nd including modern combat 3 fallen nation.with both these games I feel like I have cod nd gta in my pocket at all times.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I found the book grabs your interest quickly, which I prefer in a book I intend to read at night. The trouble with this book is that is keeps my interest going and i find it difficult to put down. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to suffer. I am enjoying it.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|The next best thing since 50 shades....there was life before 50, and life after 50; there is life before Beautiful Disaster, and life after Beautiful Disaster. If you fell in love with Christian, you will fall in love all over again with Travis. Love love love loved it - I envy those who get to read it for the first time! I have read it 3 times in 3 days - it's that good! I have read a good 20 novels since 50, and nothing has compared to the intensity (storyline, not sexy parts).  BD is the only book that has! Enjoy fellow book worms!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Not only was the story interesting, but also the comments about animal behavior, zoos, character's religious beliefs and experiences.  I liked the ending.
B008VDJFFY|4.0|Slammed is better than Point of Retreat. I found the themes in this book were a lot more interesting than in POR...one particular bit made me LOL....because I Really hadn't seen it coming - was pretty good. I would recommend reading slammed - its not one that will stay in your head/heart for a long time, but its a wee bit of chicken soup for the soul, short term.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was a good read, but not as good as expected from all the hype. However, i am planning to read next book in series.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first book was amazing. I believe that it should have ended there. The second & third are OK, but not very good. Kinda slow and not very well written.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The movie was ok. There was alot of details missing from the book. I hope the second movie is much better.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Unbelievably action packed but addictive nonetheless. A great read for those who were fans of the first two books. :)
B004EPYZTE|4.0|Conan has always been an adult property, from the stories of R.E. Howard to the comics, to the original film, its been about the brutality of the world of Hyborea. Marcus Nispel's reboot is a clear example of this and I thinkt he hard R rating scared away alot of people. I will not say that this is a perfect film. it's not by any means. But it is closer to Howard's vision of the character than the original film came in terms of the visual look of the fuilm, the world, and even the main chracter. Jason Momoa IS Conan!!! He's by far the best thing about this film. i really wish we'd have gotten a bit more of an epic story. I really liked Stephen Lang in the villain role, though i wished he chewed more scenery. And the action beats were good with verygood pacing. But the mcguffin of the story, the mask of Acheron does like nothing once it's put together. The threatnever really seemed that big with the ressurection of an evil sorceeress being the biggest looming threat. That said i really hope we get another! By Crom it was good to see Conan truly realized on the screen!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  It was very intense in the beginning and took a turn half way through.  It was like reading 2 books in 1.  I only gave it 4 stars because I was disappointed in the ending.  All in all it was a great read.  I recommend it.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I think I have read every book Connelly has written and the Reversal is one of the best. When I don't want a book to end, I know it's a winner...and this one is.  I recommend it and give it five stars.
B000M0QMM8|1.0|I was very unhappy because I clicked on the Blue Ray copy of \\"Space Jam\\" and didn't get it. I got the digital copy I guess, only to be used by watching it on the computer, something I'll never use.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Bernard Cornwell is now my favorite author. His historical fiction style is educational while making the history and characters come alive.  This entire series covers a period of history that was previously unheard of to me.  Bernard Cornwell finds a way to make the life and death decisions of people so many hundreds of years ago relevant and applicable to much of the political turmoil of today.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants books that are so good they won't want to put them down.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Loved this season of Big Bang.  It is really one of the funniest shows on television today. Sheldon is hilarious and reminds me of some germaphobes that I know.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome, fun and addictive. I always have a hard time putting it down. Its hard to describe how cool this is, so if you want to understand you have to get it.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I found this book to be even better than Fifty Shades of Grey. It was more involved, as in it had a real story plot to it. The story showed the stronger will and determination of Anastasia and the doubt this left in Christian's mind. This was so unusual for Christian the Dom to becoming almost submissive to Ana.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Before I read this book, I read the reviews (as most of us do) and I almost didn't read it. No, it is not the work of a literary genius and no, I was not challenged in any way. However, sometimes you just want to escape into a story and enjoy it in its simplicity.  I started it out of pure curiosity to see what the hype was all about.  Well, I read it in a day and was so interested in this story (not just the sex, even though the scenes are hot) I wanted to know Christian Gray's story. I had to know!  I read the last two books in the following 2 days!  When I was done, my heart ached that it was over. I longed to find another book that would suck me in, like this one did.  Please read this book!<br /><br />Laters, baby!
B008602KQI|4.0|Good quality action movie, although we thought it was not the same quality as the book. Our daughters were not happy with the casting of the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book and a fabulous trilogy. I bought the trilogy and so far I have read all the books and my daughter is on the second one now; and we both love them. I will read this again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found the Hunger Games more addictive and intriguing than 50 Shades of Grey.  It's a sad story but very interesting.  I recommend reading all 3 books to get a surprise ending!
B007SGM084|5.0|While this is slotted as Mature Erotica, the story is well written.  The characters develop into compelling individuals as a reader travels through each book. After the first book leaves you literally hanging at the end, the reader feels compelled to buy the rest of the trilogy.<br />I found the story sad as well as intriguing. The story follows the lives of two people who meet due to extenuating circumstances and become intricately entwined. Helping each other learn who they are, what they can expect of each other and how they handle various situations. Stepping beyond the sexual aspects of this trilogy, a reader will find a simply good love story that will touch their hearts and make them think about the characters long after the trilogy has been read.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Didn't like it as much as the first. I really didn't like the POV changes. I have nothing against Ky, but I really liked the first book where it was completely from Cassia's point of view. I kept getting confused & having to look back at who was talking. Then, of course, it was just more action & less romance than the first book. Also - I guess it seemed a little \\"sloppier\\" to me than the first. The fact that they let her on the ship to the outer provinces even though they knew there was one more - just doesn't seem to add up in the \\"society\\". Still... will probably read the last one when it comes out just to see what happens
B008D19WBQ|3.0|Will these have the AWFUL high pitched audio that is shown on Nick at Nite HD? They look sped up and they sound like chipmunks. Please tell me this wont be like that.
B00846REIS|1.0|This is sooo much like fifty shades, I dont even feel like reading it anymore. Definitely not worth the time and money. You said you were inspired by EL James, but where is your creativity..?
B0049VZ222|4.0|This is a must see show! It has you thinking and putting yourself in the characters shoes all through out. Kept me at the edge of my seat all the time.
B000I9WW6I|5.0|Fried Green Tomatoes, is a great old movie, in which it features woman working outside the home and the problems which women deal with every day.  all of the actress,s are perfect for the roels that they play in this movie.the movie provides, respect and bravery between the woman, plus the protection that is provied by the actresse,s  cathy bates, Jessica tandy, who played niney in the move does not come any better , and ruth that part was just  wounder  if u want a  real tear jeker and just a chick flick, this is the movie to see.  it is 100% pure entertainment  and it just gets u staight in your heart. i absloutley love the movie and highly recommend this great movie.  actually  i recommand this movie for all adults and teenagers. ikeanedjoycewow@gmail.com
B006LSZECO|4.0|One thing Gillian Flynn's husband must know by now is not to make her mad. WOW! I would have given it 5 stars except I was a tad disappointed in the ending. It was definately 'different' I will not write anything about it as not to give it away...<br />This book will keep you reading, it is a page turner- written from the day the wife disappears.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really enjoyed all if the book in the hunger game trilogy.  You were captivated from the moment you picked you the book
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Pay no heed to the nit pickers, this work is outstanding.  The story is well crafted, well paced, and captivating. Hope for a steady climb to the best seller's list.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|great app every kindle fire User should have it on their device<br /><br />useful yet inunobtrusive.<br />love the ability to calibrate to your battery
B006LSZECO|4.0|What starts off as a look into a couple's married life, where friends and foes are quickly decided by the reader, suddenly morphs into a mind bending journey through the couple's reality.  Absolute \\"can't put it down\\" novel that I highly recommend!  Enjoy!
B008602KQI|5.0|I think Hunger Games has a good plot, engages you from the very first, and makes good use of everyday scenes to tell the story.  Even though it has random killing of children, the scenes are done in a manner to tell the story without emphasizing the gore.  I have read the books and feel the movie parallels it nicely.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I enjoy historical fiction, and this was a fanciful example of the genre.  It revolves around a kind of time travel which takes our hero back to 1958 (from 2011).  It was hard to stop reading this book in the evening and cost me a lot of sleep by making me stay up later than I normally would.  I kept thinking I knew how the story would end, and King kept pulling the rug out from under my feet!  Then I would have to imagine another ending, and then out would go the rug again.  I wish it had ended closer to the ways I imagined it would end, but it is what it is and I can see why it had to be that way.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I had first played this game on an iPad and was wondering when it would eventually make its way to Android. I'm glad it finally did. It runs just as good on the Samsung S3 as I remember it playing on the iPad. An excellent way to pass some time.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Well worth reading. Nice story not to tech or boring areas. I hope that there will be a part two.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|the sex got a little overbearing in the third novel--redundant \\"Are the ever goning to stop\\" but the story in between was very good.  I like that you go back to the beginning the see Christian's point of view at the very end--It reminds us how much his character changed throughout the trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy read Read the whole trilogy within one week. Kept me up all night reading. Great read while my husband is on deployment
B005USZML4|5.0|This was another exciting Grisham mystery, fast moving with a unique ending. You will be pleasingly surprised.Looking forward to GRisham's next story.
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the book first!  Book will fill in a few gaps that are skipped in the movie and the book really explains where the Monkingbird fits in.  Overall the movie is great!
B00571F26Y|5.0|The book Wheat Belly is one of the best investment to better health . Have been on the wheat free diet for two weeks lost six pounds, my husband lost eight. It has really opened our eyes to what is the best diet .
B002RB7VMA|5.0|What a voice. His sings from the heart. He has a gift not seen since the rat pack. I am a fan for life.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|Writing style is interesting, but the plot was so far fetched, yet predictable.I immediately knew that any casually introduced character would have an important role in the plot, and of course, the beautiful young woman would end up as the bad guy.  The linking of the two unrelated events was contrived.  I found the book very unsatisfying and returned it.  sorry.  i was looking for a good read but this book really irritated me.  :(
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn has become one of my favorite authors of crime novels. She is dark, witty,one never knows where her plots are going until you get there, and her writing style is tremendously engaging. Her books are hard to put down once you start them. Her development of female characters is unsurpassed in this genre. Gone Girl is her best novel yet and the first two were outstanding. She just keeps getting better.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Didn't like it. Erotic is one thing, reading about sexuallly explicit crazy details is another. No thank you, don't find it to be an entertaining subject.
B008602KQI|3.0|Read the books, which were great.  The film lacked depth and you don't really get a feel for whom the characters are or how bad they have it in the Districts.  The books were action packed and the film was not.  In fact it moved slowly with little action.  Katniss was a survivor in the book and seemingly lucky in the film.
B0027MJU00|2.0|After having read Gone Girl and Sharp Objects I decided to give Dark Places a try. Although it was classic Gillian Flynn with the dark subject matter and constant twists and turns, I was not a big fan of the drawn out druggy line and the end became a little too twisted for my taste. It wasn't terrible but my least favorite of her offerings.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept rolling along in terms of suspense, with plenty of sustained conflict. A great plot twist was cleverly introduced. I liked this book a lot, right up until the end when I was a bit disappointed. I felt like the author just wrapped things up when she could have introduced another twist (easy for me to say).
B008JH5CVS|3.0|It's about an inch deep, but it doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is. It's a fun science fiction/action flick?
B003O86FMW|5.0|I ordered this book before I was even done with the Hunger Games! The entire series is great, I literally read them back to back only stopping to sleep a little.
B008RTE066|5.0|...Even John Lennon was quoted as saying\\" You ain't heard Pepper until you heard it in Mono\\"....you must be a child or someone with the mentality of a kim kardashian....that's all....I shouldn't have even responded...but I was compelled to..as I am sure there is not a genuine Beatles fan on earth who doesn't understand or agree with what I am saying!..Do you understand we are talking about the greatest band in the history of mankind?? ...and most of the early work was MEANT TO BE IN MONO...The Beatles were partially responsible for the overall transition to stereo...for a multitude of reasons....but there were at least 4 Albums that sound Better in MONO and the greatest album in History.... The # 1 Album of all time ...Sgt. Pepper is one of them....... BETTER in MONO!
B000FCJZ3G|3.0|A good place to start, if you're new to the genre this would be a good first book. If you've been around awhile and undertand many of the concepts in this book it's still worthwhile to re-hear & refresh things in a different voice.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|A good sweeping narrative of the first part of the 20th Century. The fictional acpects of the book makes the history come alive. It is well researched and written.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I have seen Les Miserables in the theater 6-7 times and have always found it wonderful. The 25th anniversary show also moved me tremendously. By concentrating on the music and singing, with the drama taking a somewhat smaller role, I was able to appreciate the genius of the composers even more. I could understand every word and feel all the emotions connected to the show. It was an incredible experience to see the play done this way.
B00821PCJS|3.0|Still watching Season I.  I'm told the series does get better so I'll stick with it.  It does have some twists and turns (some of which I think I've guessed already).
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I am a senior citizen and remember the first days of Batman, as well as many of the other super heroes. The stories have always entertained me greatly. This movie gives a different take on the origin of Batman. It's not how the original went, but it was certainly fascinating. I enjoyed the drama and showmanship put into this production. It provides true entertainment. It is not for younger children.
B0049VVE7Y|4.0|Turned onto this series by my nephews.  Loved it and proceeded to buy Season II.  Now if I could just find the time to watch it!
B0064BWE8U|4.0|Quite an enjoyable read.  True to Sophie Kinsellas form.  A little farfetched but a nice idea.  The only negative thing would be the use of the footnotes.  I read this book on Kindle and it was quite annoying going to and from the footnotes, infact, I gave up after a couple of pages.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I don't know what made me download this book to my Kindle. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also learned a  lot about the slave mentality, and how they survived. It was not pretty, but they persevered in spite of their situations. I recommend this book, it is a good read.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Being and older man and thinking this movie was aimed at the younger generation I was very impressed by the movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great story. Well written. Won't give spoilers but if you like crime drama this is different and hard to put down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app for my Kindle Fire! It is so much easier and faster to navigate Pinterest using this app.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This author knows how to describe a love scene step by step with eloquent description that brings even the shyest reader into the experience without shame.
B008XBHBX2|4.0|The movie is a classic, but the high def didnt seem to me to be all that great, overall four stars
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This is a nice app, in fact, I plan to use it at the dentist's today!  It would be nicer, though, if they gave you some type of soothing picture to look at, instead of just the \\"sound choice\\" screen.
B0081FO2Q4|4.0|A little David Grey a little Daniel Beddingfield.  Great album to listen to all the way through.  The A-Team is a great start but many of the other songs are really good.  Worth a listen, get the whole album.
B001JU4S44|3.0|While I enjoyed the story line, the stunt work was so ridiculously over the top and unrealistic that it ruined the movie for me.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Ties up a lot of loose ends from the first film and truely finishes the story. A 5 out of 5!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Exciting novel. You think you have the plot figured out then it takes a twist you weren't expecting. Would recommend it to family and friends
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is definitely a must read for all dog lovers.  Just make sure you have a box of tissue handy. Loved it !!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton abbey continues to enthrall its audience!! I enjoyed this season even more than the first! Definitely can't wait for season 3!!
1781161313|5.0|I remember reading this when I was a kid, and it is STILL as awesome as it was then when I snuck out of my room to watch my dad and brother watch Aliens. A+ product, and the perfect primer for Colonial Marine!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Overall, I'd say that this movie does a fairly good job of taking the book and translating it to the big screen. But, there are some significant differences. In the book, everything is shown from the point of view of the main character, where her experiences, thoughts and feelings are the only way you know what is happening. I realize that kind of viewpoint wouldn't translate well in a movie, where you have to see the characters and how they interact with each other. Partly because of this, the book is much more intense than the movie. Don't get me wrong, I still liked the movie. And if you liked the book, you'll probably want to see the movie, just to see the characters brought to life. And even if you have never read the book, you would probably still want to see the movie. I'm looking forward to the next part.
B003274QH6|5.0|I have watched this show from Day 1.  All I can say is what I said in my Title.  \\"This is the Greatest Drama in TV History.\\"  5 Stars is not enough.  Yes, some of the show is difficult to watch because of content but it is realistic in so many ways.  The details on the show are unbelievable.  The littlest item cannot be overlooked and the writers use those details to the best of their abilities.  This is a series that needs to be watched several times from the beginning to catch the little details you may have missed and come back to haunt Walt, Jessie, Hank and others later in the series.  As said I have watched on AMC from beginning then rewatched with my wife the second time on Netflix in HD who got hooked.  Now I am going to get all of the series on Blu-Ray shortly so can rewatch a third time to catch things I missed in preparation for the end in 2013.  Man!! I am going to miss this show but cannot wait another year but have to.  At least I can look at the DVD again to get ready!!  All I can do is speculate what is going t happen but with Vince Gilligan that is near impossible. Cannot Recommend this series enough!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00846TRHY|5.0|Didnt realize this movie was even out there until we stumbled on it one night. Such an amazing development of one character and heart breaking moments.
B0012GMUI6|5.0|What I like about this Waters Solo offering is that it doesn't last much over Forty Minutes, none of the songs over stay their welcome, I mean he could have made this album twice as long.<br />Written around the same time as \\"The Wall\\", it has the feel of late period Floyd, which if you like, then this album should be right up you street.<br />The only downside is the absence of Gilmore on lead guitar, which would have been the cherry on the concept cake.<br />Although I certainly not getting up a 4:30 in the chuffing morning to listen to it!
B000FC1MCS|3.0|Narration by a 15 year-old high-functioning autistic boy anchors this book.  The author captures the cadence and observations that we would imagine from such a narrator.  It is funny and clever.  Hemingway would be proud of his simple declarative sentences.  But the plot revolves around the mystery of who killed the neighbor's dog.  That thin gruel drags between the boy's observations on dinosaurs, space, God, and other things.  The tangents are akin to Family Guy -- they have nothing to do with the plot and comprise the bulk of the novel.  I like a good plot and I found the long asides a bore most of the time.  It is a quick and easy read.  Just don't buy it if you want a good story rather than the world according to Rain Man.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books are absolutely awesome! It's hard to get anything done because they are so hard to put down!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Quite suspensefull!  It really opens your mind to how complex people are, and how simple actions can be totally misunderstood by someone else.
B004IK8PLE|3.0|Even though i was forces to read thisbook for a clase i enjoyed it. Very intresting stuff.  Anyone can enjoy the book you dont have to be an engineer although if you are i think ypull enjou it more
B007SGM084|3.0|I found that by the 3rd book I was skipping forward through the sex parts.  They just had so much sex.  Normal people don't, ...cant have that much sex.  I gave the books the benefit of the doubt because they were so rich, and I don't know maybe that's all rich people do.  It was kind of hard to believe that Christian Grey, 27 years old,self made mega millionaire, speaks french, flies airplanes, helicopters, brilliant pianist, can make a woman orgasm every single time and he can control her orgasms AND he waits for her to orgasm every single time, while also being probably the most good looking man in the world, with a super large vocabulary could meet by chance a 22 year old virgin with an equally large vocabulary, and turn her into his submissive S&M partner.<br /><br />The story behind their story was OK. I liked Anna's inner goddess she was very entertaining.  I felt like I was reading soft porn/skinamaxx movie.  It had entertaining parts, but not enough to make it a great read.  I guess the best I can say is its a great series of books to read while you are vacationing at a resort and need a book to keep you entertained poolside.  Also if you would like to improve your vocabulary.
B001JIHGO0|5.0|I like the way they told the story of vampires and werewolves in this movie. Hugh Jackman is great in his role.
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought the movie was good after I watched it twice. The first time I was looking too closely for the movie to be just like the book. When it wasn't, I was disappointed. Once I came to terms with the fact the book was better, I did enjoy the movie. Just not as much as the book. I have yet to watch the special features, but I hear they're wonderful.
B008602KQI|5.0|I did not read the book, but my wife did and she recommended this movie.  The reviews were good going in and I have to say I liked the movie a lot.  I liked the choice of actors, the somewhat bizarre clothing designs and beating the system concept.  Since I did not read the book I felt at a disadvantage of character depth, back story and why it ended the way it did.  Overall, it was an entertaining movie and recommend purchasing it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I started this series just to see what our youth was reading.  Series was much better than anticipated and has significant correlation with political governance in the world when left unchecked.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|It was just ok. This didn't have to be a 3 books series. I was skimming over the sexual parts by book two. To much!
B0025CS2GU|5.0|I have viewed this video many times on TV CD and now streaming through Amazon Prime and the comedy never gets old.  Silly and corny the jokes are like old time classic comedy performed by modern artists.  There are many lines that can be taken away from this movie and mentioned among friends and all will laugh along.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put it down....I was totally absorbed by this book, however I did not like the way it ended.  I still recommend it every where I go.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book has been of benefit to me as I seem to be afflicted with this malady.  A little wordy at times, but covers the subject pretty thoroughly.  If you just don't feel good, have chronic bloating, diarrhea, gassy intestines, I suggest trying out the principles put forth in this book.  Many other, seemingly unrelated, symptoms are also attributed to modern, highly hybridized wheat.  Definitely worth a look...
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie was great. Pre ordered only wish I would have received it the day it came out in the stores. But it was worth the wait because we have watched it now twice within the last two weeks.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This marvelous and extraordinary book begins as the charming story of a young boy in India growing up in a loving family who own and run a zoo. It quickly becomes something very different. The story is entirely captivating, very well written and full of ideas to ponder. I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book took me by surprise. I was not expecting to be reading such intimate details but I found myself unable to put it down. Within a months time I am now on book three and still fully engulfed.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|Watching this on my Kindle was awesome.  The picture and audio was great - doesn't hurt that the movie is just so fun for both kids and adults.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books.. You have to read all three to actually enjoy the story.. I would only recommend the books to adults.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|This film deals with issues that plagued mankind in the eighteenth century, and that continue to plague us today.  The Mission is a master work of film production.  Even the musical score is inspirational.  The primary message of this film can be a bit heavy handed at times, but that is sometimes the point, and that heavy handedness can be forgiven because there are so many other messages here that bear only the slightest touch.
B00571F26Y|4.0|i think this book is great i lerned so much about wheat<br />i have not had any wheat in about 3 weeks and i feel great<br />i lost most of my belly fat<br /><br />i eat anything i want i am not on a diet i just cut out the wheat it made a big difference in my weight.<br />i would recomend this book to every one
B0068LYEHA|4.0|I enjoyed the book - quite funny, good insight, however it did start to feel like a rant after awhile, which was off-putting.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I watched it because of all of the attention it has received.  I don't know whether to call it a good love story or a sick futuristic story.  However, it was entertaining.
B000I9X54Q|4.0|I am new to the underworld series. I saw the 1st underworld and liked it and deciced to invest the time to see them all. Underworld Evolution is part 2 in the series and picks up where part 1 leaves off. Without giving away the plot, I will say that it will prepare you for Underworld Awakening.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is challenging enough to keep you thinking but not to drive you insane. Gets your brain working and keeps me entertained!
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|This was a fantastic movie! It deals with a very, very serious issue... but it does so in a way that is more lighthearted and \\"normal.\\" We watched this movie with our 14-year old daughter, and I think it was an appropriate message for her. Number one, it shows how serious teen suicide is taken. Two, it shows how often adults just don't \\"get\\" what their children are going through. And three, it was entertaining and heartwarming. Great movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|very erotic book but good reading....<br />not the type of book I normally read but there was so much talk about that I had to check it out for myself...
B001A5W8YA|5.0|I am a 007 fan ever since I was a kid. I remember reading mst of Ian Flemmings books in school. They are a very easy read and fast action. GREAT!!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The first book was way better! This book was good but I didn't have any trouble putting it down, like I had when I read the first book.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I liked the whole story; but the first book I liked the most; the second and third are more like love story with little BDSM.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome read. I had a hard time putting this book down. Much like my experience with the first book in this series. Really entertaining.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|This is my kids all time favorite other than the Disney Cartoons. My daughter (11) has watched it at least 20 times
B004GEB9UQ|4.0|I think the information was great and made great sense but I find it hard to cut out all the processed foods from my diet completely and right away. The 3 levels are helpful but still a little too strict for someone starting out.
B007SGM084|4.0|I thought the book was well written and kept you wondering what was next. The only thing I did not like was how often some of the phrases were repeated. I would recommend this book. It was enjoyable.
B008602KQI|5.0|when we live in a country with freedom, a movie like this makes me thankful to not want to lose the blessings we have.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I cant believe I waited so long to check this out. Im addicted ! I cant put it down. would recommend this app to anyone.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|a great book with all the info needed to start and continue an aquaponic system. i also like the links provided.i decided to join her blog and it is loaded with ideas and great people.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Love this series. Yet again they had me rolling with laughter. Such a great show. Can't wait for season 6!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in years, like The Princess Bride it has everything. Some people may be offended by the idea of kids killing kids but that's nothing new and that isn't the focus of this film.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Awesome book really enjoyed it. Easy read with not to much useless details and not too many caracters. Pity its the last in the trilogy
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was a good attempt to follow the book, it will be interesting to see how well they do with the second and third movies.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Tremendous vision by the author. Executed to perfection. You'll get wrapped up in each story, you'll be invested in each character. Masterful work.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book should be XXXX rated.  It is perverted and disgusting, plus degrading to women.  I have no idea how it got on the best seller list!
B008EQIA7W|4.0|The movie was good for what it is.  It's not supposed to be a thought provoking drama, it's supposed to be a fun entertaining movie...and that it is.  Great special effects, and good acting.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It's so easy to use!  By just selecting this app, you can see in a quick glance how much battery life is left in your Kindle.  It also tells you how long the Kindle will last based on what you are doing (listening to music, standby, etc).  I would definitely recommend this app!
B008M34IJG|3.0|It was an ok movie, not a huge story line, in fact, kind of flat.  It filled a time slot.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|So this review will not contain a summary of the book. Just what I thought about it.<br /><br />A co-worker recommended this book fm me.  He said that the authors idea was brilliant and original.  I wouldn't go that far.  It is different.<br /><br />It wasn't a can't put down book for me, but it wasn't so boring that I gave up reading the book. It did keepme interested enough to keep reading the book.<br /><br />This isn't a mystery or even a suspense.  It's more like what happens after she dies for herself and her family.<br /><br />The beginning of the book grabbed and kept my interest, the middle had me barely hanging on, and the end left me feeling, \\"that's it???\\"
B008N1LL42|5.0|don't believe what they wrote about this movie. I don't care if it's not perfect, or the greatest social commentary of the day. It is damn fun to watch. Sure, I really don't think that dropping an anchor like that would work, or that ships going into reverse that quickly, but you know what? I don't care. I still found myself whooping and hollering when the bad aliens got there just desserts. It is also a warning to one and all that just because we can do something, like sending a message to outer space, doesn't necessarily mean we should. We might not like the answer.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Great movie, Channing Tatum hit all comedic notes. Plot well developed, self-deprecating humor. All around highly recommended - already watched multiple times. Other fav comedies include My Best Friend's Girl and Blades of Glory...
B005LAIHSG|5.0|So I have read most of the reviews for this and can mostly agree with others. However, Miss Stewart aside, watching movies is about escaping the everyday (no jobs, rotten economy yadda yadda) and this movie, despite it's flaws, does just that. I own this movie and am proud of it. I have watched it three times already and find more about it each time. The best part about watching this movie, is you don't have to think \\"what's this meaning or What are they trying to get across\\" messages. I hate messages. I am here to watch entertainment. It's not a Disney version, that's for sure. All sunshine and smiles can get sickly after a while.<br />So, my general recommendation is to watch this movie with an open mind. No pre-conceptions about the actors. Oh, and if you really like fairy tales with a twist, try reading Mercedes Lackey's 500 Hundred Kingdom's series. They are a blast and a half.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i fell in love with the characters immediately. have not read a book in a long time that i could not put down like this one. although i liked the erotica part of it i really enjoyed the love story in this book. i read the 3rd book slowly to make it last. hope the writer will continue this story. have read similar books since but the writing style was cruder and i didnt feel for the characters. recomend highly, even for the most conservative people.
B000HZGCEG|4.0|Time travel, medieval history, no wonder I had a had time getting this movie. The action sequences are simply the best. The history side blends well with the rest of the movie without making it a university level final exam question. You can and will be facinated by the events and how NOT to trigger a  change to history by accident, if you are ever transported to the past. They chose the right actors for the right parts, even the bad guys. I also believe it represents well the type of conditions lived in by the peoples at that time so pay attention.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|so i'm not one to usually review a product but i felt like this deserved a review.  i know a lot of reviews are for the show which is amazing but i'm actually reviewing the limited edition zombie head case.  i received mine yesterday after debating if it was worth the money or not...answer...yes!!!  the zombie head is very well done and it's quite scary in person.  you do use the screwdriver to open the case and my only complaint is that it seems a little breakable so like some other reveiws about the product i would just leave it in the \\"eye\\".  the blu-ray set is great, i haven't watched all the extra's that came with it but for a walking dead fan i have already come across a lot of great/fun footage.  if you are a hardcore walking dead fan (like myself) this is a must have for your collection!!
B002PYW26Y|4.0|We have come a long way in special effects since the original series but this movie is not overpowered by them. The characters are believeable, though at times stiff, do draw the viewer into their realm. The movie on a whole is highly enjoyable because it does not rely on any one thing to make it work like over explanations of the techie stuff, which will send me into snooze land or fast-forward. Would recommend this to anyone who just wants to watch a really good movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app should be on the short list for those seeking to read the word on the go in a portable digital format.  This bible is easily to navigate and offers alternative bibles for reading.  GOD's word delivered in a handy format to help you meditate on the gospel on your mobile devices.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Chapman captures the essence of how men and women communicate love. \\"The Five Love Languages\\" will change how you view your spouse and help you be a better spouse by communicating in the language that they identify with. Chapman's straighforward insights on finding your spouse's love language and then applying it should help any couple improve their marriage. This book makes perfect sense and has a Biblical basis. My husband and I are practicing what we learned from this book. Our communication as a couple has never been better!
B004GUSG4M|2.0|This book got good reviews and a co-worker had checked it out and she usually reads good book, but honestly it did start getting really good until about over half way thru the book and the ending was good but then it left you hanging. Did have a good twist though but the fact that some stranger checked her out and took her home could probably really happen and noone would ever know since she had no memory.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am not someone who regularly chooses thrillers when making a book selection. Novels and chick-lit are more my cup of tea...but when I heard about this one, read the synopsis & reviews, I decided to give it a shot. The story was great and I really enjoyed the twists & turns throughout! It is intense & suspenseful with characters that draw you in whether you like them or not. I would highly recommend checking this one out!
B008602KQI|5.0|Would watch this movie over and over again.  Read all the books and can't wait for the next installment on film!
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is a cute game, but the things you can do with dragons are pretty limited.  Hopefully there will be updates that give you more options.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|For those interested in this type of literature, this is a must read.  It grabs your attention from the very beginning.  I can hardly wait for the rest of the books!
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked the movie, but it was too clean and nice unlike the books. The books are so intense, and I wanted that same experience from the movie.
B0080CL0HM|3.0|It was playfully created and had some funny parts to it. I love how the male has to learn his lesson after using all these women for his financial gain. There was only one who stood by him no matter what because she loved him and he broke her heart too. But in the end, he gets what he deserves and that is why I enjoy the ending so much.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy using this app on my kindle! I have zero complaints and would recommend this app to other potential users.
B00735HGQ6|4.0|This novel of reconciliation and self-discovery is well-paced, comic and poignant by turns. In it we meet a cast of strange characters such as are to be frequently found dotting the British landscape. In his pilgrimage which is also a flight from his loveless relationship with his wife, Harold enjoys the generosity and inspiration of some, is beset by the bossiness and snobbery of those who want to turn his personal gesture into a national event, and eventually finds peace with himself. Pathos and delicious irony abound. A very good read.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|What a great story with a lot of insight into the workings of Steve Jobs' mind.  He never really interested me, ordered the book more out of curiosity.  Found I truly appreciate his work and dedication to his will for technological developement.  Sure he could have been more personable, but he wasn't a people person first, he was a creator.  Sometimes you just cannot be all for everyone.  He had a business to run and ran it his way, which apparently has worked.  He was a genious, and it is sad his family did not come first, but in most cases they don't.  His wife knew who she was marrying so I do not hold his working vs homelife against him.  So glad I got to meet him through this writing.  Will probably go back and skim through it in a year.  (By the way, I prefer windows and do not own an Apple product... yet)
0590254766|5.0|\\"...It's pretty obvious that these books are allegorical. Even if you don't know who C.S. Lewis is, I think it probably doesn't take a genius to figure out the religious representation throughout this book (and the others). I don't follow a Judeo-Christian path, personally, and I have no problem reading this; it's not at all preachy, or so obviously Christian that it reads like a rewritten Bible story or something. So, regardless of your own religious affiliation (or if you aren't religious at all), The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent choice if you want to sit down for a couple of hours for a fun, light story of magic and adventure...\\"<br /><br />For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:<br /><br />herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com
B005IQZB14|5.0|Loved it! I was sorry when i finished the book. It made me want to experience time in nature alone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|From page 1 the story unfolds slowly, making you wonder if you missed something. Once you surrender to that sit back and enjoy how this author puts sentences together and draws analogies.  So talented. I couldn't put it down. Read it in 2 days and it's 400 some pages.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed had guts staying power and an inventive spirit. She grew beyond her demons,she gave real meaning to going on the mountain or 40 days and nights inthe desert
B0037BB00I|3.0|Her \\"21\\" album is so much better. At times she seems not sure of her voice. She has matured quite a bit after this one.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|A highly overrated volume.  i am still waiting to lol.  where is the humor?  whomever said that this is a fabio paperback with a little s&m tossed in was correct.  it was curiosity that caused me to succumb, maybe, a bit of jealousy, as well.  not for the content, but that someone could develope a simple idea, add a bit of shock and make millions.  would love to see the numbers........how many of you spent your money out of curiosity and how many found this a valuable lesson?
B008M87GJK|4.0|I've really enjoyed this app.  It works well, the videos load quickly, and it offers stories from around the world.  I do wish it had more British content, hence the 4 star review.  But all in all, I'm pleased and use it daily.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love,love this book wish I could give it 100 stars this book is a must read but then again anything Nicholas Sparks writes is worth reading he is a outstanding writer and his books will pull on your Heart strings just read one of his books or  watch any of his  movies you will become a Nicholas Sparks fan for life I promise........ Phyllis
B0087HT36U|1.0|What an unoriginal piece of crap.  It froze up my phone countless times, unlike it's popular counterpart angry birds.  Another difference was that it cost 4 dollars while angry birds is free.  If I wanted to throw money away like this I'd be better off going to the casino.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|One of my favorite songs that Colplay has released. It's a catchy.tune that stays with you. Love the lyrics music.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Pretty good movie - enjoyed the stunts and the parking tower smackdown. I gave it 4 stars because it took me awhile to remember much about the plot. Who was the bad guy again? What was he trying to accomplish? How was he thwarted by our intrepid band of IMF agents? Still, I remember enjoying it at the time (3 weeks ago?).
B002KC8BSO|5.0|Great cult film, Bruce was at his smart ass best! Great conclusion to the Evil Dead series. Don't forget Evil Dead 1 and 2 also!!
B0088TG252|4.0|I like the plot.  It has mystery, suspense and a surprise turn of events not expected by me.  I especially liked the way the movie ended.<br />However, I did not rate this movie a 5 star because I would not watch it a second or third time.  This movie is full of rought action and I personnaly would not let any young child watch it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great book it kept me turning the pages.  I can't wait for the sequel to find out where Abby and Travis's relationship goes.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|finally the 3rd books wraps it all up after some creative, intriguing, revealing, never-ending-what-else-is-there-on-these-books, sex encounters - well described for most all audiences - I've had my good share of lust so I need to go and practice some...
B00846REIS|5.0|Hot and steamy.  I can't wait to read Sylvia Day's next book to get caught up on Ava and Gideons relationship to see where Sylvia takes them next.
B0026SCMNM|4.0|This is a lovely story.  I can't explain why I care about this Irish girl, but something about her and her circumstances touched me and  made me feel like an innocent again.  Perhaps it is a reminder that the individual heart and all it's emotional complication is the core of what moves the world both forward and back.  Our choices are not black and white, but they always have consequence.  Choose and live with the consequences.  It is not that hard.
B008M34INW|5.0|great movie from start to finish. harsh,gritty,action packed and funny just like Mel used to do.I will watch again!! highly recommended..
B008JH5CVS|3.0|The movie as a whole was a great way to fill some of your action hunger. I had a little trouble with Guy Pearce's character at some points being too cynical for a realistic portrayal of his character. I was thinking that if this guy is this cynical, why would he be concerned about anyone or anything but himself. The female lead was sufficient eye-candy to hold interest but the character was fairly transparent. All in all a good action movie and worth writing a review, but nothing to write home about.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|It was interesting to see how the legend of Count Dracula began.  I thought it was worthwhile reading; the vehicle for telling the story consisted of journal entries, letters, and excerpts from newspaper articles.
B00845PV16|3.0|My big question is how did Johnny Blaze wind up in Eastern Europe? Just a thought: Don't they know there is plenty of evil right here in the good old USA? I would have thought he realized that he can run all he wants but he cannot hide. Apparently not, huh? Anyway, I would have liked to see more Ghost Rider action sequesnces and less convulsing by Johnny Blaze. A pretty good action flick but quite frankly I could probably get more excitement out of reading the comic book.
B008ODZNLG|4.0|Who knew that a documentary about sushi could contain so many truths about having a positive work eithic. The documentary was well made, with beautiful music. Unlike most documentary films, this one did not seem to have a political agenda and instead was a story of an incredible man, and his family/students. Well done.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|After hearing Ed Sheeran at the closing ceremony of the Olympics I knew I had to get his cd and boy am I glad I did. His voice is unbelievable and unlike anything I've heard in recent times. The last song 'give me love' is worth the purchase alone. Love him and this cd is great!
B008602KQI|4.0|Loved it! Fun film to see after reading the books. The cinematography wasn't the greatest at first but it got better as it went. :)
B000MQPKVG|5.0|One of my favorite movies and deserving of four Oscars.  The film is beautifully acted with a realistic portrayal of Thackeray's 18th Century novel, and it will be included in a new book about some of Kubrick's works being written by an English professor at an Ivy League college.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|i found it very intereting and kept my attention through the whole book, the writing was good.The plot was good.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Very enjoyable read if a bit confronting.  Very graphic scenes and in places a bit too much detail.  Well written with strong characters. Good storyline.  Christian is a very complex character and part of the attraction of the book is to try and figure out what makes him tick.  He changes constantly from nice guy to sadist and back again and at times is very much a Jeckyll and Hyde character.  Anastasia is portrayed as a typical all American girl but there are darker shades to her character that the relationship with Christian uncover.  This book leaves you wanting to read the next one so you can find out what makes Christian tick and to discover the secrets of his past.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I have read all 3 books and was looking forward to watching the 1st movie. At first I was a little leery when I rented it and saw how long it was but was pleasantly surprise how fast it moved. I have seen purchased the movie. Would recommend it to anyone. It was very easy to rent for Amazon.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The 50 Shades of Gray series was an \\"OK\\" read. I read the first book which was rather disturbing in the way Ana was treated. Some of the scenes were \\"hot.\\" When you get the idea that Christian was abused as a child, it moves you to read the next 2 books. However, the characters in the book were never really developed. I really got bored reading about how much she loved him every other line!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very through and well thought out Bible app. the best by far. Why carry a Bible with you in book form when you have this app.
B00571F26Y|5.0|The information provided in this book is profound and should be required reading by all college Science students. It explains so much and when the simple advice (remove wheat from your diet) is impletemented, the changes are remarkable. I cannot imagine anyone not considering this life changing and life extending diet modification. With Einkorn and Emmer wheat more readily available, this remarkably simple lifestyle change can literally change your life.  Best nutrition related book I ever read!
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This \\"Tree\\"rific movie gives you understanding and a small glimpse what were doing to our beautiful planet. And together we can accomplish anything. The writing was witty,smart,and very humorous. Fun for the whole family. Absolutely a must tree, I mean... A must see. ;-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in about five days because I could not put it down. I liked the movie (yes I saw the movie first) but decided to give the book a try. Loved it do much I bought books two and three before closing out my Kindle app. LOVED Peeta in the book! Can't wait for Catching Fire. Already started it.
0470570954|5.0|The book was in great condition, brand new and it saved me looottss of money from the bookstore. Is a great tool for biochem class and I really like it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great addition to my Fire.  I can quickly access it while working in other features of the Fire.  It's easy to use and the feature where it saves the last entries is much more useful than I had anticipated.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great game for long road trips and whenever you need a quick challenge! Totally worth 99 cents.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was good but not as great as the book, of course. In spite of this, I would still recommend you watch it.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|A fast paced novel treatment of  murky financing deals. Well written but, do we really have that many well-paid idiots on Wall Street?
B003O86FMW|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Graphic and precise but a very good read overall. Love her style and twists and turns in the book. Unpredictable which I love. Have now read all three and am onto Gregor.
B007MDQW3W|4.0|I first noticed Regina Spektor on the Letterman show, and she blew me away.<br />Her music was infectious, the words so original and descriptive. Her expressions surprising and her delivery superb. And, then I listened to her interview on NPR's 'Fresh Air'and was captivated by her style and originality. I purchased her CD and listened many times.<br /><br />First of all, Regina's voice is one of the most distinctive out there. She can go from musing and romantic to silly and fun, but never frivolous. Her words and their music are too serious. Regina immigrated from Russian as a small child. She and her parents lived in New York City where she was introduced to music everyday, the Beatles, classic rock, folk songs and classical music. She studied music as a small child and then moved from classical music to her now eclectic style. She is well known for her originality and her style. Many television shows use her music, and now she has become recognized. Regina Skeptor is a classic.<br /><br />Her latest CD is exciting. My favorite is the song about museums and the paintings wanting to jump off the walls, 'All The Rowboats', with her distinctive vocalizations. Then 'Ballad Of A Politician', with it's superb satire, \\"shaking, shaking hand; Shake It, Shake It Baby'. The other tunes fall into place and deserve a place of their own.<br /><br />Regina has a constant discussion with her piano tuners about the loudness and banging that occurs. She wants a smoother, more soothing style, and, she has to let them know this is her style, this is who she is. She is a romantic unusual stylist with a voice that overcomes any singular complaint. She is superb, what more can be said?<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-06-12<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001MYHBPU My Dear Acquaintance [A Happy New Year]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002COTI64 Far]]
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I got started on this series when the HBO series came out and I love these books far more than the show!  They are huge books which just makes me happy because I know I have a lot more to enjoy.  The pace never lets up - I never want to put it down!  When I am driving home from work and I start to think of the characters and what is going on, I am anxious to have my reading time.  Isn't that the sign of a fabulous book??  Get started on this series, you won't regret it!
1401235417|3.0|Not quite what to make of this Batman storyline. First of all, the originality is that it really doesn't feature the perennial Joker. OK it was Dick Grayson in disguise. Thankfully no Two Face, Penguin, Scarecrow, Killer Croc etc. New villains are always welcome (unless they turn out to be Hush).<br /><br />Not being a comics fiend, I understand that this is a rebooting of the Batman. So some liberties are taken with the history. Perhaps it me but these villains all look rather familiar in their costumes. The people wearing Owl masks remind me of villains faced by the Punisher (Marvel) and the Owl Talon character reminds me of one of the Watchmen character. Some of the lengthy box text are rather hard to read - black text on dark green box.<br /><br />This comic leaves on a note of more h(owls) to come.
B00846REIS|5.0|Fantastic read! It was dark and sexy. I did not expect it to have such a great story. Ican't wait for the next book. I have already pre-ordered it.
B00633W614|1.0|I am trying to wade my way thru this novel. It just is not a page turner, but I keep hoping it picks up soon or I'll have to retire the book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Thank you Amazon! I love this Book # 2!I loved #1....but oh, so much sex!!! (Not complaining, really)!<br />I was intrigued with the \\"buzz\\" about this Trilogy, and now it's become a great subject for conversation!<br />Christian is learning so much from Ana; about himself, his dark side and the man who lives within trying to escape his oh so dark past! Ana, also is learning so much from Christian, her \\"Fifty\\". She's learning about the deep horrific life he has kept buried for so long! She has no idea how powerful her love for him is, and how loving him and accepting all of \\"Fifty's\\" emotional and phsychological flaws and scars, empowers her even more, and is teaching Chritian to trust and LOVE on a level he never has known! I love her sub conscious...a character of her own, and how Ana pays such close attention! The story is gripping and I find myself really loving \\"the read\\"! I've not been a really avid reader, but my curiosity about this trilogy, has driven me! The conversations with my girl friends are amazing, as we ponder reading excerpts aloud to our husbands, significant others, etc! My husband has been asking me on a regular basis...\\"how's your book\\"? I tell him...awesome...a wonderful love story, that has taken so many different avenues to evolve! I love the characters, and love, love Ana and Christian! They challenge each other in this unpredictable relationship. I hope all goes well for them, but there seems to be obstacles, never-ending! Looking forward to more!!I have a Kindle,(from Amazon) and love it, and the ease that Amazon has provided for uniterrupted continuation of this amazing story, as it takes only a few minutes to download from Amazon to my Kindle..never missing a beat!!<br />Thank you!  Judy Day
0547569653|5.0|Great motivational read for this old has been. I appreciate Scott sharing his life story which, while completely different than my own, I could relate with easily. I also had fun reading this book and read it quickly over four nights (which is unusual for me).<br /><br />I'm not long winded and I don't want to over analyze this book like many people do. Just read it you'll like it.<br /><br />Bottom line: The book is a fun, interesting and motivational - especially for runners and those trying to improve or get back into shape like myself.
B004VQK9XW|4.0|Good to see SIXX AM back in action. Thought HEROIN DIARIES would be only a one time deal. This band ROCKS!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I loved the first Quell, and this one is equally addictive.  I got it this morning as it was a free app of the day and if your reading this and its still free, get it! Its a great game, even if you do pay the .99 cents for it, its still fun and addictive...
B005LAIHGI|4.0|If you like Borat...you ll love this movie.<br />As his movies continue to insult everyone, it sure continues in this movie.<br />But if you look real close, you will see lots of truth in what this movie is<br />trying to say...and also shows you a bit how the world is run.  All points<br />to MONEY MONEY ...AND LOTS OF MONEY, bribes  and payoffs.<br /> No wonder so many have tried to bury this movie as a stupid movie...but hey...i<br />liked it...made me laugh...made me think...<br />  Great little script....great little movie....<br />A keeper.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|Just a little Cheesey but not too bad. It was meant for the younger crowd. I still enjoyed it and you will too.
B008602KQI|5.0|AWESOME! I love this blu ray! The video and audio transfers are good. Enough special features. Great stuff. Jennifer Lawrence is one amazing actress.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I loved this app till I updated it & now it either crashes or freezes and pictures disappear. Plz fix this!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. I've downloaded multiple versions from this and rarely take my hand held Binle to church anymore. I even use this as my concordanance.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Although the bulk of this novel takes place in Montana and rural Canada, Ford has done a good job with it.  The first half of the book recounts the narrator's experience with his parents who rob a bank.  The second half takes place in Canada and tells the story of what happened to the narrator once he is parted with his parents.  The book was very well-written and the author goes into great-yet interesting-detail in his description of the various scenes.  The plot was simple, yet engaging.  I would recommend this book to those who enjoy good writing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Beautifully written book , twisted love story. It is a MUST read. I'd definitely read it again ! Cannot wait for the movie !
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a textbook example of a skilled writer.  After reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" I couldn't wait to get my hands on the second work of her continuing trilogy of books, \\"Catching Fire\\".  What a story and a real page turner.  I could hardly put it down. The fact that it is a work of fiction but made so believable is a feat in and of itself.  I am now in process of reading her third book, \\"Mockingjay\\" and it's as riveting as her first two books.  I would highly recommend all three of them...an excellent read!!
B008602KQI|4.0|The hunger games was really good but had just finished reading books so of course so much left out. The movie didn't really get thru much of the first book but it was good.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|Pretty compelling effort, especially for guys that have been doing this for so long, with so many twists and turns. Possibly their best effort since Presto, which is the album that originally hooked me. I haven't fully absorbed Clockwork Angels, and I know that I'm not in love with every song on the album, but it is very solid as a whole. I'm enjoying it.
B007T99ENE|4.0|A new McEwan is always a much-anticipated treat, but in this case the book didn't quite live up to my, admittedly high, expectations. A lighter than usual confection, this novel set in the world of Britain in the seventies - the three-day week, the Cold War, spies and traitors - shows off McEwan's considerable writing skill.<br /><br />With a large nod to literary greats, and a self-indulgent nod to his own earlier work, the book is clever and, as would be expected from this author, full of tricks. We follow our young heroine, Serena, as she almost accidentally becomes involved in the shadowy world of MI5. She is an attractive character and this story of her various relationships both personal and professional is entertaining.<br /><br />However, once I'd finished the book, I was left wondering what was the substance of it? Once all the tricks were displayed and understood was there anything left to savour? For me, the answer was no. I enjoyed reading it but it left no lingering aftertaste. And now I know the answers to the puzzles, I can't imagine I would get anything from a re-read. Like a card-trick, it's only impressive till you know how it's done.<br /><br />In summary, a light, enjoyable read that held my interest to the end, but missing the depth and complexity of the author's earlier work.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the series of the three books starting with the Hunger Games. The DVD is faithful to the book except on some minor details. They did a good job of expressing a majority of the killings without actually showing the violence.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book seems to be a \\"duplicate\\" to the Fifty Shades. There are many elements like nightmares and including words that I just read in the 50 Shades. I am tempted to say it was written by the same author under a different name...
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved reading this book and the twists and turns.<br /><br />I enjoyed Gillian Flynn's writing so much, I went on to read previous books by her as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|Highly recommend. Once you start playing you can not stop. It's a great game to compete with others, seeing who will get the highest score.
B0088TG252|4.0|As always, Denzel made of good effort to make the plot believable and entertaining. A nice plot twist at the end of the movie left you with a feeling of satisfaction when the credit were rolling. Great job Mr. Washington and all of the supporting players, I recommend this movie for any \\"action & Adventure\\" buff.
B007MQSR6O|1.0|I ordered a couple of inexpensive audio books for a long car trip this summer.  What a mistake.  I didn't know that the voice would be a computer.  There was no emotion, no pauses for commas, and a lot of mispronouncing of words.  If I didn't already know the story, I would not have been able to follow it.  All the sentences were run together, and you couldn't tell who was speaking. I probably listened for about 15 minutes.  It was all I could stand.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I intended to review this book on my Kindle before purchasing it, but I clicked on \\"buy\\" by mistake. \\"OH well\\", I mused, it can't be that bad because it is so popular. It was worse! I anticipated a romantic story, but it was just smutty. I thought the author of this poorly written book had to be a male, but I was wrong again.  With much chagrin, I deleted this book from my Kindle.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I find most of these games boring, very little challenge. This actually not only challenges me, but I can honestly say some are very difficult puzzles. Sometimes takes me several minutes and attempts to get the more challenging levels.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved this movie, it inspired me to read the books which were even better. This movie was so close to the book and visually spectacular, I was very impressed. Can't wait for Catching Fire!!
B0031RS8UI|4.0|I enjoyed The Undomestic Goddess. It was a very pleasant read: well-written, good plot though somewhat predicatble. The first part was the most fun for me as nobody does things going pear-shaped like Kinsella. I especially loved some of the first domestic attempts described. If you want some light and fun reading, this is your book!
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I loved the description of this book - \\"Kooky\\" and \\"Charming\\" - but what I found was \\"unlikley\\" and finaly \\"I don't think so\\". I thought several of the story lines were predictable. And I  wondered if maybe Harold should have been on anti-depression drugs. I did give it a 3 because it was just a so-so read.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This really delves into the relationship between Walter and his partner, Jesse.  The web of lies they weave becomes prominent in this story.  Well done.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|What else is there to say - it's an Amazon App store app that allows you to browse or search the Amazon App Store direct from your Android device. I've had no problems using the app on my tablet. The only improvement I could suggest is a delete feature, for those daily free apps I tried but no longer want to keep. After deleting them from my tablet, the app notifies me they're available to upgrade/reinstall and won't let me purge the list of unwanted apps.
B006LSZECO|1.0|What a waste of money.  I love a good read but this one was just not good.  I could not get into the characters or the story line.  I kept trying but finally just had to give up and eat the cost of this one.  It really stunk.  And whoever tried to compare this to Fifty Shades was out of their mind, not even in the same ballpark
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Works perfectly.  Best app I've found to replace the lackluster default calendar app in most phones.  Makes my life SO much easier entering my work schedule, seeing as many times I'll work different hours each day of the week.  Really like that it saves the most recently used descriptions so I don't have to type the word 'work' over and over and over again.  That got annoying before I found this program... Not really sure how this could be any better, but keep up the good work!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Regardless of what one, as a reader, may look for in a meaty novel the Millennium trilogy has something for you and then some. Evolving characters, daring plots/subplots, facts and figures, pacing and complexity. My only criticisms are slight the first and foremost being that there are only three books out of ten to indulge; the second being some of the translations were occasionally confusing falling heavily on British English at times when American English would have demanded more. The conclusion, the books are dynamic, compelling, and ever evolving which means you can read them more than once with great interest.
B00846REIS|3.0|It was on the order of Fifty Shades, but not as involved.  But it was a quick summer read, and I enjoyed it.The characters were interesting but a little predictable.
B007SGM084|5.0|Everyone I know was reading this book, but no one was saying a word and after reading I know why.  Was not at all what I expected, but oh what a surprise.  An awesome series that I could not put down.  Every turn of the page was a surprise, the characters were awesome, the secretes were an enlightening surprise.  I blushed, I laughed, I cried....These books had it all.
B004J4WKDI|1.0|It has rarely happened to me that I have chosen a book and I have felt like it was a chore to get through it.  I have never not finished a book.  This book was almost the first one that would have had the distinction of not finishing it.  At about the halfway mark I was so frustrated with the pace of the book that I started skipping ahead by just reading the first page of each chapter.  I then read the final couple of chapters just to see how the story ended.
B005IXIAWE|5.0|I selected this book for my book club. Unfortunately, only half of us actually read the book to completion because of the length and the wordy sofistication of the language was so daunting. Those of us who read this all gave it a five out of five rating. I loved the twists and turns of the plot and how it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I love how the narrative changes the point of view. The very best part of the book is the description and development the characters
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This was a good movie and it looked awesome in HD!  The books are so much better, but for a stand alone movie it was still good.
B008602KQI|5.0|I'm very glad I read the books BEFORE I watched the movie.  You understand it better!  W. Harrelson is the PERFECT Haymitch!
B006ATJXQW|2.0|I have read all three of the other books in the Maze Runner series and I have enjoyed them.  I like the lighter read that a young adult book has and those books certainly fit the bill of one that held my attention, kept me entertained but didn't require too much thought.  The Kill Order did not.  The characters were much less developed than the other books.  I felt little to no connection to them and so I did not have that \\"can't put this down\\" feeling while reading it.<br /><br />There are parts that contained flashbacks from the main character and I enjoyed those parts of the story most, but that was not nearly enough to support the whole story. I feel like I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know from the other books.  My husband and I were reading the book at pretty much the same time.  When I finished first I was so disappointed.  He asked me if it got better, and not wanting to spoil the book for him I did not divulge my opinion.  He finished the next day and handed me the book and said, \\"what a let down.\\"<br /><br />All in all this book felt very forced.  If you are looking for more information about the Flare, the kids from the Glade, or WICKED you will not find much in this book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book Gone Girl was ok. I have read several other books by this author and this was not her best. The story line was good though, hated the ending. I really wanted the \\"wife\\" to be found out by her parents, police and other people in the story that she tricked. The \\"wife\\" was a very  ungrateful person, which makes a very interesting character.
B000SEHJGQ|1.0|I give this book one star (only because my review could not go through without giving it at least one star). I found this book to be very unworthy of any stars, which is surprising, as I feel all books have a value - but not this one.  I read about one-fourth of the book while on a trip and turned off my Kindle, as I found the \\"story\\" content to be anything but enjoyable.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Finally a book that actually kept my attention! I read this book in 2 days flat.. couldn't put it down! Anyone who gets bored easily: this one is for you!
B003ZIZ2HK|5.0|This set is phenomenal. It is just beautiful, all the extras are just the icing on this cake. Double sided poster, 3 booklets, are cards, and a hard box LOL. If you love Arrow releases or Battle Royale then this is the one to get.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|Watched the live concert on tv then ordered this set, great music.  Exactly as it sounded during the show, great live concert quality.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I got my item i just love it  i was so excited when it was delivered i haven't used it yet  but  very soon.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Boring. But I am a compulsive reader, must finish the thing. I'd rather Have just on volume. I feel they extended the plot for marketing reasons.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|This is a must see for everyone! Timeless movie. Tom Hanks brings to life a character that showed the best of humanity.
B002MFULQO|5.0|I was just a small child when President Kennedy was shot.  I became interested in this movie after reading Stephen King's 11/22/63.  I felt this was extraordinarily informative and feel that this conspiracy theory is true to life. Very interesting.
B00845PV16|3.0|Amazons video service is not responsible for the Cage factor that was in this movie. I can't really write a fair review of a character and franchise that Marvel seems to be putting enough money into but not enough heart. This movie suffers from Nick Cage delivery issues at the most. The plot is super predictable and the action is pretty contrived but, the movie looks amazing. The rider always looks menacing and powerful, which is a much needed improvement from the original. The pacing is for the most part fine and the camera work doesn't make you want to barf so all in all not too shabby. For mindless action entertainment with some sweet special effects, it's certainly worth viewing.
B007T99ENE|5.0|What a great read.McEwan at his best.I have read most of his books and this one is right up there with the best of them .I read this in 2 days and started reading slowly  when I was 75% through the book  as I did not want it to end.I  have to re read it now as there were  parts of the book that I didnt get  but thats no detraction from the content.There were many layers to this story which keeps it a page turner.LOVED IT
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great read, and a fast one at this. I look forward to the remaining two books in the series
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love it so nice and relaxing. I can set the timer to go for how ever long I want.  A good thing to have if it's hard for you to fall asleep at night.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|It isn't worth reading.  They should have ended it with book two.  Of course by resolving the little details that were left open.  But honestly this book sucks.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is the best movie I've seen this year!  I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end.  Watching the movie has spurred me on to read the whole trilogy.  I'm very pleased at how true to the book that the movie is.  I can't wait for the second and third movies.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The app is great. Easy to use and easy to read. I looked at other apps and settled on Caculator Plus for my Kindle Fire it works Great.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|When this decided to work, it worked, but when using it with my phone, the phone kept registering that the headphones were unplugged which would either fire up the speaker on the phone or pause the music.  Very frustrating.  Amazon handled return beautifully.  No issues there, just disappointed  with product
B003BW0CB6|5.0|This story was equally as compelling as the Lincoln Lawyer and the Fifth Witness, but showed a different side of Haller. Great job touting his skills for the prosecution and nice to finally see him working with Maggie McPherson. I wish the rest of the Haller series would get made into movies.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I recommend this DVD to any Bob Marley fan and non-fans too! It is well made and brings many extra features like interviews with Ziggy and Stephen Marley. A must have.
B0086DBE62|5.0|This is a quirky retelling of Snow White with some really funny scenes and has Julia Roberts actually playing the bad guy ! It is definitely worth watching-no horror in this one-at least not the graphic blood and guts that seems to be so pathetically popular with movie makers these days. There is a lot of sarcastic humor which enhances the role of the 'evil queen'.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Nice book, not spectacular. Got bored toward the end when he hooks up the band of supporters.<br />If you want a sweet read without too much prose, this is the book for you.
B004NELBPC|5.0|have been following this site since the beginning and have loved the growth and inclusion over the years! worth a try and don't be surprised if you enjoy the variety... its a keeper!
B000Q76K1A|5.0|This one is a favorite of mine. I always tune in when I'm up late and catch it on tv. We wanted to introduce our tween daughter to action for a family movie night and chose this one because although violent, it's not gory and the sexuality is minimal. Great flick!
B0082Z447U|5.0|This was a great book, beautifully written and compelling.  I could not stop reading.  It was as riveting as \\"The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\\" without the nightmares.  I am now blazing through Wilkie Collins novels.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I really like this app.  There are so many different types of news provided and it's so easy to pick and choose what I want to read.  Perfect!!
B008602KQI|2.0|In my opinion the movie spent entirely to much time in the preparation for the games and not enough time in the games themselves. The opportunity was there for a pretty exciting movie but was wasted on boy-girl relationships. I was expecting a lot more Hunger Games themselves....Like I said, there was a lot of possibilities and much of the movie time was wasted...
B0011EU0NG|5.0|We love this movie, both my husband and I watched it when we were children and finally got to add it to our video library. Fun for all ages, and even fun for our parrot, who loves to bob her head up and down during the faster-beat songs.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I have realized one shouldn't choose a book based purely on media hype. I was disappointed in this book. I like a story with depth and meaning, I found it very shallow and kind of like a \\"B\\" grade movie.
B008IYR2BA|3.0|So I payed for this....where is the download to MY computer button? As far as the show goes its great.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Fight Club is a good movie to purchase as it is even better the second time!  You pick up on a lot of things missed the first time.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|It's a page turner. Highly recommend it. Just watched the movie and the book is way better. First two books are great. Last one seemed rush.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is not as straightforward as you might think if you have never played it.  For each situation where you are trying to get to the pigs with the birds you get a different array of birds to do the job.  The birds have different strengths and uses.  You often have to break down barriers to get to the pigs.  Some of the birds are ineffectual against the barriers.  That's where tactics come in.  You cannot simply rely on brute force.  Each set of games has multiple levels you must go through and successfully completing a level is what unlocks the next level for play.  Each level also has three scoring stars.  You need only achieve one star to go to the next level but you are encouraged to go back and play each level until you fill out the three stars with higher scores.  This is a really enjoyable game and it becomes addictive as you feel the urge to go back to it and continue to play and strive to unlock every level.  Give it a try.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love this app. It is easy to find stations that I like to listen to. One of my favorite apps on my Kindle Fire.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Highly recommend!!!  If you liked \\"Gone Girl\\", this is just as good, if not better.  Rich characters, well written, a real page turner!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Disappointing. After all the hype, I was not cued into this book. The back and forth chapters, one character/viewpoint to the other was distracting. Neither character garnered any loyalty or sympathy. Unsatisfying and depressing ending. No one is that smart to have done everything this woman did to make her husband her slave. Somehow reading about two totally dysfunctional people brought no \\"escapist\\" feelings that you usually get when you read a good book. It was like watching an episode of Jerry Springer unfold in the pages. Not a fan.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It catches you right away and keeps surprising you! Well written! You really relate to the characters and feel for them.
B006W0QR1S|4.0|The movie held my attention. I thought the acting and the story were very good. Ryan Gosling didn't have much to say, but gave a very good performance dispite that. All the main characters were good as well, with a surprisingly good job by Albert brooks as one of the bad guys.<br />I watched it twice in three days, if that helps you.<br />I wasn't thrilled with the ending. It left things a bit up in the air. I'd say more if I didn't think it might ruin it for those yet to watch it.<br />I would have given it four and a HALF stars if that option existed.<br />Good flick.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Went through the whole series in less then a week from when I received the season. Looking forward to the newest season.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|decent movie, always disappointing after reading the book.  Liked some of the twists that were different from the book actually.  But as a fishermen it left much to be desired.  Except one really amazing cast.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This is seriously the best book I've read in a while. A friend told me it was a good book, so I decided to read it without knowing much about the plot. Once I started it, I COULD NOT STOP. I was engrossed with the journeys of the different characters, and I loved how the book is told from different point of views. Awesome awesome awesome.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three Hunger Games books are very thrilling. As you are reading them you never know what is going to happen next. You think you've read it all and then something different and very creative happens that definitely keeps you reading. Suzanne Collins writes so that at the end of every chapter something happens and you have to read on. You can't stop at the end of chapters.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really enjoying \\"Gone Girl\\" It is taking subtle twists and turns that keep me guessing. I really like the book and definitely recommend it!
B0060D0OKW|5.0|The movie is wonderful on my kindle fire! It comes in clear. My grandson loves to sit and watch in the car and gets the giggles when the flowers sing! Great classic Disney movie!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I loved the inventive imagination of the author. In my opinion, far surpasses the first book. Can't wait to see how it turns out on film!!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I am half way through the third book and don't want it to end! I will miss Christian and Ana! Yes, there is a heck of a lot of sex. Those two cannot go half a day! But if you look deeper into the messages in the books, it is also an amazing lesson for anyone in a relationship to look at how they treat the person they are in a relationship with and how they go about understanding their behaviour. I have learnt so much!
B000P0J09M|3.0|Good movie but don't like the fact that I have to flip the DVD over to watch the rest of the movie.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Another great book in the \\"a song of ice and fire series\\". The story keeps getting better and better. Buying the fifth book immediately!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|WORST trilogy I've ever read...sorry I  wasted the time and money on this drivel.  Don't understand what all the hoopla was about.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book really kept my interest, I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. Amy was a real gem. Poor Nick. I think a sequel would be good. It would be interesting to see what happens from the end of the book. I'm trying not to give too much away. All in all I enjoyed the story.
B00080Z53O|5.0|Esta película es fenomenal.  Creo que Bardem juega un papel fantástico de Ramón Sampedro.  Los paisajes que vemos en esta peli para 'cambiar de aire' son buenísimos.  Les muestro esta película a mis estudiantes para que empiecen a ver lo bueno que puede ser la cinema española.  Es increíble.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|La primera entrega de esta saga, thumbs up, la entrega fue justo a tiempo y el producto en perfectas condiciones!
B000RVK1AQ|1.0|Slow. The devil is almost ridiculous. No dramatic intensity at all. The action looks fake. The end is too easy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the first book so far. Gives a human side to abuse at the hands of a goverment.enjoy the players and trials they go. Through.in the storey you fill how catness must be filling...the conflick between staying alive and needing to kill ones she ccare about. I truely wounder how we would fair?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent read, wonderfully written. Catches your attention from beginning to end. The characters and the story are all well written, invigorating and exciting all at the same time.
