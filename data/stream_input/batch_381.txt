B0000DYJM6|4.0|Mid 90's Pearl Jam returns with some awesome B-Sides and Unreleased songs. If you miss the old grungy style of PJ from the era of 10 and VS. you will love this CD!  I Like the second CD &quot;Dogs&quot; better because it has some of their slower stuff. Some of the songs on this CD suck, but at least half of them are excellent. I was so happy to see the release of this, I don't like their new stuff so this CD brings back some great memories of PJ that I know and love.
0375707972|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was unlike any other I've read.  It was an easy read and kept my attention. I recommend it to everyone.
6305910340|3.0|No one can play chess well without years of practice. The idea that a 10yr kid one days says I can play is unrealistic.  Bobby Fischer used to study 18 hours a day for decades.<br />The other part I thought was unrealistic, was the guys in Washington Square. That everyone in the park is a drug dealer or alcoholic or general bad influence. Thats total crap. Lots of guys in the park are bad, but the good players above 1800 arent.  You cant play at 1800+ and be doing drugs or alcohol all the time.  It requires a lot to get to 1800+. If you think it is easy to get to 1800+, by all means give it a whirl.<br />I like chess because it is both science and art. Like the sweet science of boxing. Or japanese samurai sword fighting.
B000002LQR|5.0|i loved it. It was awesome ya'll.The songs i liked.......ALL OF THEM!!!!!<br />AC/DC rules!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|Let me start by saying that Room of fire is a big disappointment to me. When I bought &quot;Is this it&quot;, I was blown away within seconds by the low-fi still raw sound/noise of the opening track. When I gave this a try, I could not believe my ears. Why insist on the same technique? Why not take a step ahead and dare to push it to new limits? It seems like mister Casablanca and co. have been goofing around just looking forward to complete an album that is mediocre in comparison to their earlier work. Most of the songs sound like a pirate copy of some backstage rehearsal, and throughout the CD Julian does not seem very interested in opening his mouth to let a single clear word come out of it. I usually keep an open mind with new bands, especially when they are praised as the bearers of a new moment in music. But after listening to this bunch of incongruent noise I can only wonder, in a very Carrie Bradshaw way, Is this it?
B000092ZYX|5.0|I don't care about the crap people say about Radiohead being overrated and over-exposed and overdone. Whatever. Truth is, they are without a doubt one of the greatest bands of all time. As for an earlier post called Thom Yorke a whiny loser, let's see you make it as far as Radiohead has. What, what's that? Impossible? Yeah, that's right. And we need Prozac huh? Maybe you need hearing aids, or a more open mind.<br />As for &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; you are invited to the not so kind world of Thom Yorke and his mates. The songs are amazing. The sound, the structure, the talent, all unique and incredible. You get a virtual smorgasboard of great songs, deriving sounds and influence from all previous Radiohead albums, but still being just as unique and interesting. &quot;2+2=5&quot; is a great start to this fantastic masterpiece, with a good hard rock sound, great drums and rhythm. Yorke never ceases to please, with songs like &quot;Go To Sleep&quot;, which has a very warm feel to it, with a good softer rock sound. &quot;There There&quot;, the album's first hit, is as hypnotic as it is eerie. And you haven't seen the video for this wonderful tune, check it out, it makes the whole song even more interesting and enjoyable. &quot;Myxamatosis&quot;, my personal favorite, is one of the most loud and intense Radiohead songs I have ever heard. The lyrics are very dark and poetic, &quot;The mongrel cat came home/Holding half a head/Preceded to show it off/To all his newfound friends&quot;. Now, can you get that deep and creative with any of the rap/emo crap on the radio or on MTV these days? No, of course not.<br />Which is why Radiohead is an important part of the musical scene. Not only have they spawned a large portion of the indie rock genre, with bands like Grandaddy, Coldplay, Cat Power and others, but have always given us what was in their hearts. Anybody could sit down and write a song, but it takes a genius to write songs as deep and methodical as Radiohead's. <br />Take this advice and buy the album. Forget the media hype, and all the other crap people have said. Open your mind and your ears and listen to the sound of on of the most emotional and real bands to ever grace this world.

B00004RF9B|2.0|I purchased this DVD in the hopes that I would be seeing the original CINEMASCOPE print of this sci-fi classic.  Sadly the only frames in Cinemascope are the opening credits.  The rest of this glorious film has been chopped up to accommodate a standard format.  What a loss!
B00013PHGS|4.0|i like air.  i heard the new cd at the shop, it is good stuff.  i am reluctant to actually purchase it.<br />as gustavogp from mexico city said it is copy controlled.  i unfortunateley bought the new massive attack, jane's addicition and the new radiohead with this.  i am beyond unhappy with this new control stuff.<br />i own over a thousand cds and have never used napster or any file sharing service.  while i have recorded to mini disc from friends, this usually causes me to find new genres of music i wouldnt normally have discovered. the end result is that i buy their other records or later release from then on.<br />can people please mention if all the copies of this cd are cd controlled....  as i live in tokyo and gustavogp lives in mexico city is it possible they are not copy control cds in the states.  my friends there never had a cd with it...<br />please let us know about this<br />definitely boycott all cds with this technology.  i cant even dub copy controlled cds to my md so i can listen to it on the train....  seriously not a good way to treat your dedicated buyers.... i am definitely not going to buy a portable cd player for my copy controlled cds...<br />:-(<br />_________________________________________________________________<br />thanks everyone for all the feedback on the copy control stuff.  unfortunately i will have to wait to get my hands on the US version.  remember dont ever buy copy control stuff you will regret it!
0312263120|3.0|I have already read Browns two better-known books, The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. They did not disappoint - with the exception of the Nancy Drew/Hardy Boy &quot;perfect&quot; heros and heroines, the plots were fascinating and the books were real pageturners.<br />However, this book was disappointing in that (1)the lead characters were extra-specially gorgeous, perfect and infallible and (2) it seems that the author let his own opinions on the availability of private communication data to the government be known over and over. However I would certainly read him again, though I cannot really recommend this book.
B0000931QR|2.0|LODVG hace un pop fcil y dulzn, que para mi gusto pierde la frescura que podra tener a causa de la mega-hiper-exagerada produccin que aplican a sus canciones. Esto hace que su sonido sea excesivamente comercial y oculta a menudo el mrito de algunas de sus canciones. Se les va la mano (a ellos o a su productor) y es una lstima; pero a ellos parece que lo nico que les importa es vender como rosquillas.<BR>Por ciero, que las canciones en s tampoco me enamoran. Son correctas, pero falta chispa en las melodas, y las letras son irregulares: alguna interesante y varias horriblemente oas y estpidas. Le doy un 3 sobre 10.
0743243307|2.0|Since most of the reviewers have already shared the storyline of this novel, I will spare the reader any more- much as I wish Monica Ali had done. The novel is 300 pages too long...<br />Read Jhumpa Lahiri instead.
0553579908|4.0|I'm not sure how the author does it, but while other sprawling fantasy epics can have the characters and plotlines blend togther to the point where no one really cares anymore, this guy manages to make many different viewpoints and people distinct and three-dimensional. He juggles what seems to be an insane number of contenders for the throne to the Seven Kingdoms, and makes you realize what makes everyone different, and differently (or not) qualified to rule. <BR>He is not afraid of killing his characters and what I also like is that everyone is believably shaded, morally. To often there are books like this with a hero that has one, single stock flaw, fighting villians that are plain crazy or evil without reason. These books have people that range all over the moral chart and it's refreshing.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Ok...  this band has very much been over-hyped, and for a good reason!  This is one of my favorite cd's, and I love the way the lyrics are sorta slurred 2gether.  If you liked 12:51 (the first single), then you should definetly check this cd out.  There is no filler- but a couple of the songs run together which is why I only gave it 4 stars.
B00008ADPF|5.0|I became a Nickelback fan with Silver Side Up.  Since then I've aquired their concert DVD, The State, and The Long Road.  If Nickelback fans are expecting another Silver Side Up, then don't buy this album, it's not the same.  The songs reflect the wild ride that Nickelback has been on since the whirlwind surrounding Silver Side Up.  Silver Side Up had a lot of great songs, but in my opinion, the material on the Long Road has more maturity and depth than Silver Side Up.  Songs like Figured You Out and Feelin' Way Too Damn Good have both depth and a meloncholy quality that will make this album endure.  This album isn't for the occasional rock listener.  It's like 80s rock meets 90s edgier music.  The music itself is a bit repetitive, although very good.  The lyrics are the reason that you must buy this album.
0767803434|5.0|This is one of Harrison Ford's best. I have always enjoyed his movies. He is a real actor and there is not many left out there. This movie has a plot to it and was well made, there are some kind of fake looking part in it but over all, very good.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|I loved this musical-- or technically opera, I suppose. Anyway, the music is beautiful and the singing is absolutely amazing-- each singer seemed perfect for their part. The basic story is excellent of course, and it was even better for me after I read the book. <BR>   I take French in school, but I personally don't think that it's necessary to have any knowledge of the language to enjoy this show since it has English subtitles anyway.<BR>   You don't want to miss this enchanting &quot;tale of lust and love so true!&quot;
B00013PHGS|4.0|While their masterpiece \\"Moon safari\\" stylewise landed somewhere between Morcheeba and Kraftwerk, this album moves closer to the latter. More electronic blip-blop, less groove. Not necessarily a bad thing, if you like the blip-blop. I rather liked the groove better. Still, this is a pretty cool album, more introspective, and it's true that it grows on you. Oh, and, I absolutely loved the bonus dvd - some really good clips (although the audio recording sounded a bit saturated during some parts).<br />Many seem to like \\"Cherry blossom girl\\" and \\"Alone in Kyoto\\" - these might be the first to get your attention. Later on you might discover \\"Universal traveler\\" and \\"Mike mills\\", which both sport very cool but subtle guitar tracks. There are no bad tracks. This is an album of discovery.<br />P.S. Works fine on my computer.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This CD rocks. Buy it now. Nothing else should be said. Buy Now. Mmmmmmmmm Good Music.
B00001QEE8|5.0|It took me some time to realize how wonderful this movie really is. I watched it only once the day I bought it in 1994 and never looked at it for years. The main reason was because I unknowingly bought a bootleg and when I discovered it when I got home, it took off my enthusiasm to watch it. And so the tape just lay there on the shelf for years, until my then 8-year-old cousin came to my house (by this time I've already bought a legal copy of the tape and watched it a couple of times) and I gave her my old copy. Boy were she and her brothers happy! The tape never left their VCR for a year. And so I decided to give this film a second chance and I'm glad I did. &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; is an excellent film. The animation is remarkable; some of the vistas in the film are breathtaking. The music is catchy, you'll be humming to it all day long. Also, all the characters, and especially Baloo, are very easy to love. Add this masterpiece to your collection. You won't regret it!
B000007T1M|5.0|System of Down's talents are very obvious, but less obviuos is how deep their lyrics really are.  I had to look up many key words, like in the song Darts, when they sing Arise again the Gods Ninti and Ishkur.  Ninti turned out to be a Babylonian Goddess that was called lady of the rib LONG before Eve was written of in the Bible.  And she was a healer and giver of life as opposed to Eve who receives life.  I found this sort of thing all through the album.  It focuses very much on the Goddess and pagan ways.  The storming of poor June...Juno is the Roman version of Isis.  If you read the lyrics for Suite-Pee you will see it saying...&quot;Try HER philosphy&quot;.  It is an anti thesis to Christian domination which in War says ONE was written on the sword.  Even if I am completely wrong, I learned a lot from looking this stuff up and all the same, the album rocks!!!!
6305263248|4.0|This is one of the smartest, most exciting action movies I've seen in years.  The car chases are amazing, the plot is very interesting, and the acting is first-rate.  I must say however that Deniro (one of my favorite actors) actually seems to be phoning it in little bit here compared with the other actors.  They actually seem to be more &quot;present&quot; in the situation than he is.  I'd highly recommend this movie and I'm surprised that it's not better known.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Jet knows how to rock. Plain and simple as that. They have a great sound, and while they bring to mind some of rock's great geniuses (Stones, Iggy Pop, AC/DC...) they still manage to sound distinctive and original at the same time. <br />The bigger rock bands out there right now (Creed, Nickelback...) ought to take a page out of Jet's book and try for a new, more individual sound.
B00004RFFW|3.0|A good second installment in the series.  It does some good character development of the principles, but it's easy to see why \\"buddies\\" became more important in the later films.
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|I've been reading about how this band is really standing out from the rest, being hailed as the future of metal, the next Iron Maiden..yadda yadda yadda.. So I bought the hype, went out and picked it up.  While I must say they have a pretty original concept and sound, it is a FAR cry from the album that will save Traditional heavy metal.  <br />It seems to me (both musically and visually) that this band does not know who they should be---In Flames, Iron Maiden, or a goth band such as the Cure or Bauhaus.   And it shows in some of these songs. Once you get in tune with one of the styles, it throws you for a loop with something totally different in the same song. Not my cup of tea, as it takes away from the cohesion of the tracks.<br />I am giving this CD 4 stars due to the melodic but heavy nature of the material, as well as this band sticking to their guns and saluting traditional metal with a few guitar solos and melodic vocal passages here and there.  HOWEVER, what I am disspointed in is the insistence of including death/hardcore vocals in practically each and every song.  This, plus the too-eclectic nature of the songs are holding this band back from taking the next step at this time.<br />This band is on the right track, however, and if they ditch the screaming totally and focus on melodic vocals then indeed Avenged Sevenfold could be on to something here...They should look at the band Katatonia as a blueprint. In the meantime, I think the comparsions to Metal legends such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, etc HAVE to stop. NONE of those bands ever had death metal style/hardcore vocals in their songs, which in turn opened their music to a wider array of audiences and ultimatley mainstream acceptance.<br />For those of you looking for a more accurate portrayal of true heavy metal in 2004, check out the aforementioned Katatonia (anything after Brave Murder Day) or the new Iced Earth or Hammerfall.  In the meantime, best of luck to ASX!<br />Thanks!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is what Hollywood should be doing more of. This flick doesnt fit the whole &quot;I know where this thing is going&quot; we see every day. Simple story with a great friendship, wonderful acting, &amp; funny! Check it out!
0140157352|5.0|Incredible book! You will learn a lot about yourself and other people too. A must read!
0780631684|4.0|There I was, summer of 2001, the night before I left home to start a new life at Grad School in the States and I get together with my high-school buddies to kill one last keg and watch one last movie, and some smart-arse has to choose...Final Destination!<br />I swear, the plane rides I had the next day were pure skin-crawling, bowel-loosening terror.<br />Final Destination has an interesting enough premise - can you escape destiny? After a premonition and a messy, graphic, boy-am-I-glad-I'm-not-flying-tomorrow plane crash, 7 kids find themselves in this exact situation -  They've cheated death, but for how long?<br />Well, about 98 minutes should do it...<br />The film was made by the Morgan/Wong partnership who were responsible for a lot of the early X-files episodes, you know, the good ones.  You can see that influence seeping through into this film, with a malevolent, unstoppable, anonymous killer and a brilliant sense of timing, suspense and action help raise this above standard teen horror fare.  Not that far above mind you, but the plot inconsistencies are swept away by the drama and the slightly daft premise is obscured by the rising tension.<br />Final Destination isn't going to set the world on fire, but there are far worse ways to spend an evening... As they say in the movie, you can't beat a good bit of cabbage!
089898890X|5.0|The best intro book for jazz drumming.  John Riley introduces the style, complete with information on cymbals, tuning and equipment.  <br />Regardless of experience, you will quickly pick up the skills to go as far as you want as a bop drummer.  Independence, comping, brushes, solos, charts...it's all here and presented clearly.  The attached cd is good to help you hear what the lessons sound like and to provide several tunes minus drums to play along with.
B00005U16N|2.0|Johnny Depp plays George Jung, a drug dealer who became responsible for a big part of the cocaine traffic in the US. This picture tells his life`s story, presenting the processes and changes he went through, living wild and risky experiences which didn`t seem to have a big purpose.<br />Similar material has been shown in a more original, interesting way in some Martin Scorece`s movies, and director Ted Demme eveen creates a couple of scenes that bring the master to mind. However, \\"Blow\\" lacks a point, it`s never that engaging and doesn`t have great moments or sequences to deliver, becoming tiresome and too long.<br />Also, it`s a movie that relies more in style (camera angles, soundtrack, clothes) than in substance, never developing its characters beyond two-dimensional figures that don`t make us care about their fate. Even Penélope Cruz, who plays Jung`s wife, doesn`t have much to do here apart from talking loud and looking sexy. The results are just average, offering a shade of what it could have been if handled properly. As it is, \\"Blow\\" is just a little sketch and not a big explosion as its title suggests.
0451204530|1.0|This is, frankly, a terrible book.  It's made more so by the fact that Follett has written great books before (Pillars of the Earth, for instance)...so what the heck is he doing here?  It is, at best, a first draft for any novelist.  The plot: contrived.  The characters: unbelievable.  The writing: tepid, sophomoric.  Whoever was editing this should be taken to task as well; there are obvious repetitions of the plot (like \\"Pete's\\" reasons for looking up to Anthony getting explained at least twice) that should have never made it to print.   <br /> <br />Ken, you're too good a writer to be churning out garbage like this. Take your time and give us something worthy of your talent and time.
B0000A9GLS|2.0|John Cusack and Ray Liotta, amongst others, get lost in a motel in the middle of nowhere. It`s a rainy, obscure night, and suddently people start getting murdered for no apparent reason. As each character dies, the closer we are to descovering who the murderer is...<BR>This James Mangold`s thriller (&quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot;) has a few nice twists and surprises, but the character development isn`t strong enough to make us care much and the multiple changes on the last part only make it worse. It has a suspenseful atmosphere, competent acting and neat direction, though the final result doesn`t step above average. A decent, schizophrenic thriller, but nothing great or terribly exciting. Watchable.
B00011RPB0|1.0|This review is written by someone who truly loves small, independent films, and foreign films, as well. Movies like The Salton Sea, Italian for Beginners, Love and Death on Long Island, Cyrano, Envy, Shall We Dance, and The Sweet Hereafter are some of the most underpraised works I've seen over the last 10 years. But unlike those gems, Lost In Translation is...well...let's just say you can color me bored. This &quot;movie&quot; is less a plot-driven film than a series of excruciatingly slow vignettes. There's little, if any, character development - we're given no real reason why we should care about either of them. What's lost in translation is the alleged &quot;chemistry&quot; between Murray and Johannsen. So neither of them like being in Tokyo. So they both apparently are not fond of their spouse's ways. So what! Murray's character is vacuous when he should have been played as world-weary, and Ms. Johannsen's screen presence is nothing if not forgettable. The dialogue is spare, but not in a good way. Ms. Coppola stated in a recent interview that her screenwriting &quot;expectations&quot; were low. She has not exceeded them. I've heard better dialogue in adult films. <BR>The fact that this film - and Murray - is nominated for an Oscar is mind-boggling. Apparently there's no accounting for taste.
0385504209|4.0|This was a heart pounding thriller that had you thinking about religion, art, and important and interesting issues.  Who cares if it's not 100% accurate?  You'll learn more in the 80% that is accurate than if you didn't pick it up at all.  I need to read something mellow after reading this book.
B000003NA3|5.0|John Coltrane, after leaving Miles Davis's group hot off the heels of &quot;Kind of Blue,&quot; took to making jazz records of increasing brilliance, complexity and beauty.  &quot;Giant Steps,&quot; &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; and the underrated &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; showed Coltrane taking grand leaps and risky chances with his material, and succeeding!  When deciding to record his first official live recording between Nov. 1-5, 1961 at NYC's Village Vanguard jazz club, there were many influences that possibly guided him to these performances: Sonny Rollins' own daring &quot;A Night at the Village Vanguard,&quot; friend Eric Dolphy's brilliant playing and his interest in Eastern music.  These things all coalesce into one of the best boxed-sets ever issued.  The key compositions here, &quot;India,&quot; &quot;Impressions&quot; and especially &quot;Chasin' the Trane,&quot; show Coltrane playing his most free/avant-garde prior to the release of &quot;The John Coltrane Quartet Plays&quot; and &quot;Ascension&quot; (1965).  Coltrane squawks and wails, but only after setting up each tune with wonderful riff after wonderful riff.  His band, especially drummer Elvin Jones and bassists Jimmy Garrison and Reggie Workman (pianist McCoy Tyner is largely--and strategically--absent from many of these takes), provide a propelling background for Coltrane's explorations.  Another key aspect to these recordings is the wonderful playing of Eric Dolphy, who seems to free Coltrane up even more.  Other highlights include the first take of &quot;Miles' Mode&quot; and the second take of &quot;Naima,&quot; which sounds quite different from the original on &quot;Giant Steps,&quot; yet still packs the same emotional punch.  Simply put, this set is indispensible for any jazz fan.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I loved this movie. I find it to be one of Bill Murrays best ever, and his absolute best recently. By all means see this movie, but DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!! It says specifically on the cover of the box WIDESCREEN This is a blatant lie. This movie plays in full screen mode with no option to change it. This is not a multi layered disc, not double sided, it is full screen only. On top of that, there is now way to skip past the previews on this disc. Pop the DVD in and you must watch the previews, or at least fast forward through them. This was a very poorly made DVD. It has no commentary (which is forgivable, but I like commentary) I tell a lie. It has come to my attention that my PS2 will play this movie in widescreen format. Once again, no options, it just did it. All right, so some of you out there may be able to watch this movie in glorious letterbox, but at the very least be wary. If a low end DVD player like a PS2 plays this movie widescreen and not my DVD player, then there is a problem.
B000084T18|3.0|This has to be one of the best CD's I've ever heard in my life.  To hear his positive lyrics is a breath of fresh air in hip-hop.  I think he is one of the few artists who doesn't have to talk about drugs, guns, and violence.  Instead, he decides to use clever wordplay and lyrically draws unbelievable pictures for you to see.  Hold on. I'm sorry, I thought I was reviewing Talib Kweli.  Oh well, this album is O.K.  Mostly hype though.
0451191153|5.0|This is truly a great book.  Ayn Rands' writing is beautiful, some of the best descriptive prose I've ever read.  The story is wonderful and will keep you turning pages.  But the best part of it was the introduction to the philosophy of Objectivism, which, at the very least presents interesting &quot;food for thought&quot; and possibly can change your life if you want to try to live by its principals.   The book is long and very dense, but I thought that every page was additive to the novel.  I could not believe some of the other reviews I saw on this book, I just don't think they got it.  Yes some of the language is &quot;cheesy&quot; and a little dated feeling (the book was written in the late 30s and early 40s).  But this is very minor when compared to everything else you can get out of the book.
0385510438|5.0|I had expected this to be yet another good-lawyer vs bad-lawyer/law but though it was about the law, it was more, at least for what I enjoyed, about the characters.<br />Grisham's Novels seem to have such colorful participants in them and this book, does not disappoint or detract from that.  Yes, this is a different type of book from what has been published in the past, but it is none the less, a very entertaining addition to his body of work.
0385504209|3.0|I found the codes that Brown used throughout this book intriguing. I was somewhat disappointed with the beat of the book, however, because I thought it would be paced more like Brown's other book Angels and Demons. Thank goodness for epilogues because I would have been truly disappointed if there wasn't an end to finding the Holy Grail.  The Davinvi Code was worth the read and I will certainly recommend it to others.  And to those who said this plot was all lies, HELLO; this book is fiction!
0446530891|4.0|I picked up this book and a discount book store.  It is the first time i have read one of his books.  I loved it.  As i was perusing some of the other reviews, I noticed how harsh people were being of this book.  I am not a writer, but i read an average of a book per week, and i couldn't find anything wrong with this story.  I plan to seek out his other 2 books and see what it is I have been missing.  His characters were beautifully developed, which is a huge selling factor for me.  If i don't feel some type of emotion towards the players in the story, i don't want to waste my time reading the book.  I didn't know whether to love or hate Joan. Sean reminded me of Sean Connery's version of James Bond. Michelle is an empowered yet soft female.  The story moved along at breakneck speed, and i was at the end before i knew it.  It was a hard book to put down.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A few years ago Maynard James Keenan, from the popular metal band Tool, and a well known guitar technition formed A Perfect Circle. In 1999 they created Mer De Nomes, one of  the most exciting debut albums in the history of rock music. Now after a lengthy hiatus they are back with their new record entitled Thirteenth Step.      Thirteenth Step  is a surprising follow up. Everything still sounds like A Perfect Circle but many of the hard edges and the rawer tastes of their first album has been smoothed out to focus more on layers of melodies, textures, and different sounds. But this does not mean the band has gone mainstream. The heavy songs on Thirteenth Step are harder and more intense then the band has have ever been before. Also there are new musicians and lineup changes that have been made in the last few years. This I feel comes out in the new music.     In my opinion this album is definitely more \\"out there\\" and less straight forward than it's predecessor, but has a lot to offer to anyone who wants to hear Maynard and the rest of these musicians at their best. Don't expect Tool. Don't even expect the same APC you had last time. But expect an album that gets better and more addicting the more you listen to it.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Can't believe this studio is stopping the release on DVD AGAIN! What is the problem now? There is no excuse for this and it really is unfair. With all the junk that they put out on DVD, they can't release Ed Wood? Come on Buena Vista, get with it and make this happen...SOON!<br />Johnny, help!

B000127LW2|5.0|I enjoyed Star Trek TNG but this series semmed to just go so much further. It was a little shaky at the beginning, like most of the other Star Treks but Kate Mulgrew (Capt Janeway) delivered such an engaging performance and was supported so well by the other quality acting that it is near impossible not to be pulled into and mesmerized for the duration of this 'voyage'. I think the creators should get a social service award for the positive role models they portray. The world is a better place with Star Trek Voyager in it!

B00000JNO2|5.0|As a serious Skynyrd fan for over 30 years, I must say that picking any of their original studio efforts as a favorite, would not be wrong.  Of course we're talking about one man's opinion.  Gimme Back My Bullets happens to be my most prized.  The writing was more focused, (would Ronnie allow otherwise?), the guitar playing was condensed and tasty, and the sound was not as busy as the 3 guitar lineups, and allowed for Billy's sound to surface a bit more.  The band was really hitting their stride when the boys recorded this one, and they were still hungry.  They'd been on the road for a few years by the time this was done and the soul and heartfelt lyrics were genuine.  I'm glad they remastered this one, the original had some record company sound issues which was not the bands fault.  Double Trouble must be recognized for the great song that it is.  I sure do miss Ronnie, Allen &amp; Leon.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|There's no doubt that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a different kind of movie for most modern film-goers.  There's no morphing, there's no getting pounded over the head with the music, and sound effects don't swirl around you while you watch it.  However, if you're a fan of the French New Wave (look it up if you don't know), you'll recognize that Sofia Coppola has made a lovely valentine, not only to her star, Bill Murray, but to a style of groundbreaking film that seems quaint by today's corporate-sponsored monolith standards.  Other reviewers have outlined the story - or supposed lack thereof - so I won't get into that.  But anyone who tells you nothing is happening in this film is approaching it the wrong way.  Maybe it's best to simply quote the brilliant jazz pianist, Bill Evans, and leave it at that:  &quot;Some people just want to be hit over the head and, if they get hit hard enough, maybe they'll feel something. But some people want to get inside of something and discover more richness. And I think it will always be the same; they're not going to be the great percentage of the people. A great percentage of the people don't want a challenge. They want something to be done to them -- they don't want to participate. But there'll always be maybe 15% that desire something more, and they'll search it out.  And maybe that's where art is.&quot;
B00005YU1O|5.0|I can't believe that no one has mentioned the music in this movie - even if you're not a tango fan, the beautiful melancholic insanity of the music is the perfect weave with the &quot;storyline&quot; that constantly pushes your tolerance and attention. If you are a tango fan, for the love of god just buy the movie already. This movie is one of those rare gems that makes sense on one level the first time you watch it, and more and more levels the more times you watch it, which you have to do just to pick up all the cool little details woven in. I've never seen a movie so visually and verbally integrated - the freedom of animation allowed the storytellers to make everything one cohesive trip - fantastical thoughts and ramblings get fantastical scenes that because they're shot from live actors, retain about the same connection to reality that a dream does. Such an amazing movie.
B00003CWN3|1.0|I would just like to point out that Brandon Teena was not a butch lesbian, as some people have stated in their reviews. Brandon Teena was a F2M transgendered person who should be referred to as a he, not a she, and most definately not as a butch lesbian. If anyone was confused by his identity in the movie, I suggest you read up on transgender identities and issues before you post an ignorant review.
B00005U8EM|5.0|GROUNDHOG DAY is one of the most innovative movies to come along in some time.  <br />What would you do if you found that you were trapped in today, no tomorrow ever coming, only the very same events happening over and over again? Maybe you would panic at first and then begin to consider the possibilities.  You would see that, having no tomorrow, being able to remember each previous repeated day and beginning the same day anew, you could do anything you wanted to.  Prank after prank might ensue.  This would be followed by total boredom and maybe feelings so low that you might just try to end it all only to find that bright and early the \\"next\\" day things just started all over again.<br />But then you discover that with your newfound \\"immortality\\" you might just be able to do something good for yourself and for everyone you encounter.<br />In GROUNDHOG DAY the great Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a primaddonic, self-absorbed weatherman who finds himself in just such a scenario.  He goes through every possible phase of trying to figure things out, at last accepting his fate and determining to work as hard as he can, every repeated day, to do the right thing for himself and everyone he encounters in Punxsutawney, PA. Andie MacDowell plays Rita, Phil's producer, whom Phil is finally able to win over as a result of becoming over time the very best and accomplished man he can be.<br />The script is wonderfully written and the movie is masterfully edited as scene after scene repeats itself to show the subtle changes that take place in Phil's view of things.<br />Over ten years old, GROUNDHOG DAY is just as charming as it ever was and packs just as important a message today as it did at its debut: time is precious and with a little effort, a change here and an improvement there, any of us can create a life that is truly remarkable.<br />Douglas McAllister
B000063DI9|5.0|This is a highly underrated album, not just from Iron Maiden's long-running career, but in heavy metal all around.  The last to feature the \\"classic lineup\\" for the band (until the reunion in 1999), featuring Adrian Smith and Dave Murray on guitars, Steve Harris on bass, Nicko McBrain on drums, and Bruce Dickinson performing vocals, SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON is simply a masterpiece of heavy metal.<br />As many know, this is a full-fledged concept album, telling the story of a clairvoyant man who predicts a terrible, apocalyptic fate awaiting in the future of a village of people.  And they're not listening to him...  The actual story is somewhat unclear, but that hardly matters - each song does so well on its own.<br />The beginning and ending of the album feature light acoustic guitar strums with Bruce crooning, \\"Seven deadly sins...seven ways to win...\\" with a fairly magical quality.  However, in the first case, atmospheric keyboards (from Steve Harris) pulse in, and then the great, galloping, familiarly majestic sound of Iron Maiden kicks in as \\"Moonchild\\" starts.  Speaking of keyboards and synthesizers, there is an obvious presence of them on many parts of the songs, most memorably from the aforementioned song and the sweeping, epic-feeling bridge of \\"Infinite Dreams.\\"  However, unlike what most people say, I don't think the use of synthesizers is too blatant; it is used just in the right amounts to help flesh out the sound.<br />Smith and Murray's guitars are among their best here, with their fierce, tight duels (and again, my only complaint about the band, THEY NEVER CREDIT THE LEADS/SOLOS!), and jaw-dropping leads and hooks.  This was the last album to feature Adrian Smith, who would quit shortly after, but was replaced by the almost-rival Janick Gers.  Nicko's drumming, as usual, is full of colorful, smooth, precise beats, and excellent usage of snares - he is definitely one of my favorite drummers.  Steve Harris is so amazing on bass - he never seems capable of playing a simple rhythm; his fingers always dance across the frets with such ease, only some progressive rock bassists can beat him.  His shining moment is on \\"Only the Good Die Young,\\" where there is a bass LEAD - the guitars hold up a rhythm behind him as he makes this galloping juggernaut of tight, powerful, low-ended sounds.  And then there's Bruce Dickinson...his range of power, emotion, and real singing is very unique and quite unmatched, from deeper growls, to uber-high-pitched screams and even some crooning.  What a tight band!<br />Now go out and get this album immediately.  Highly underrated in both Iron Maiden's catalogue, and in heavy metal in general.  This album is simply PERFECT, and an excellent addition to anyone's collection.  Can you play with madness?
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I am shocked by the number of negative reviews of this incredibily creative, brilliant, thought-provoking show and, as significantly, the show's amazing music and lyrics that leave anyone with a heart skipping out of the Gershwin theater humming the tunes if not belting out the lyrics.  This is the stuff that great musicals are made of.  Are the lyrics sensitive and caring?  Yes.  Does that make them trite?  Only if you are the quintessential cynic.  This show is about being yourself, standing up for something you know is right, overcoming physical abnormality and realizing that your greatness comes only when doing all the above and, critically, being yourself.  It is about how there is good in everyone...and bad as well...and often they are indistinguishable.  It is as uplifting as anything Broadway has produced in recent memory.  If you aren't mesmerized by the end of Act 1 and on your feet when Act 2 ends, there is something wrong with your humanity.  <br />The CD?  Priceless.  While it omits some of the wonderful dialogue, particularly toward the end, it captures the magic of the music.  The leading ladies have gorgeous and powerful voices, both having a vocal range that spans several octaves.  (As for the person who said they sound nasal, aside from apparently being in need of a hearing aid, s/he undoubtedly despises Streisand, as well.)  This is one of those, perhaps, rare occasions when the public, that has flocked to this show in droves, is right and the supposedly more &quot;enlightened&quot; critics are way out in the stratosphere (though somewhere far from Oz).
B00003CWL6|5.0|&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a pure cinematic triumph that is both funny and sad.  It's disturbing... and yet, it's extremely provocative and deep.  The film is an extraordinary achievement that reveals a tragic and realistic story about a family that is anything but ordinary.  It's a film with so many layers that it is almost impossible to dissect them all in one single thought.<br />Meet Lester Burnham; a man who feels like he's completely dead inside.  His wife and daughter despise him and do not show him any signs of respect.  On the surface, the family seems like a picture-perfect family that everybody dreams about--but inside is a completely different matter.  His wife is obsessed with material possessions and doesn't care for &quot;petty&quot; things like love or life, while his daughter resents herself because she isn't &quot;perfect.&quot;  Lester's mental coma is rudely interrupted when he meets his daughter's friend and starts fantasizing about her.  The awakening might be due to a disturbing thought or feeling, but the wake-up call changes Lester and allows him to realize that there's always time to erase his &quot;forced-image&quot; and be the person he really is.  This is all a set-up for a funny, disturbing and tragic movie.<br />I don't know about everybody else, but my mind was literally racing around when this movie was playing before my eyes.  It's one of those films that allows you to pick up on something different upon each viewing.  As I said in the beginning of the review, this film has a number of layers to it.  There's so many different meanings and points to the film that it is nearly impossible to describe them all in one little review.  Besides, the fun part of the movie is discovering these meanings and points for yourself.  You know a film is successful when you totally lose yourself to it and allow it to challenge you in every way.  The film is crafted flawlessly and doesn't have a wasted minute in it.<br />The acting from Kevin Spacey is really a sight to see.  He gives his character all of the right needs and feelings that is necessary for the authenticity of his role.  You don't even look at him as an actor--but as the real person he portrays.  It is certainly a milestone in his acting career that will continue to be remembered throughout all cinematic history.  Annette Bening is also superb in her role and brings life to her character, as well.  Everybody in the film should be applauded, as they all make the film what it is.<br />The DVD has some neat features to offer.  The picture quality is fantastic and the sound is more than great.  You have the option of watching the movie in DTS if your system is able to play it.  Extras included are commentary from the director and writer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, cast and crew biographies, trailers and more.  While I wouldn't had mind a Two-Disc edition of the movie, this is a pretty impressive package overall.<br />&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a breath-taking masterpiece with a very high replay value.  It's a terrific film on every front and does not disappoint for a single second.  While it's not a movie that everybody will like, it's most certainly one to check out if you are a lover of films.  If you're looking for something that isn't so ordinary, then this may be the chance that you are seeking.  I feel that it is a unique and superb film that is very hard to express in words--you'll just have to experience it for yourself. -Michael Craneey is really a sight to see.

B00005YW4H|3.0|This is a pleasant enough album, but too monochromatic and lightweight for my taste. Good backround music, for sure. But a GREAT new talent on display? Not really. <br />I get the feeling that people who really love this record have not been exposed to a lot of music in their lives. Certainly I can agree that when compared to what else makes it to the radio or MTV/VH1 these days, Nora Jones is a breath of fresh air and nice change of pace. But if you have exposed yourself to many lesser known artists, you already know how much great and unique stuff is out there that is missed by the masses. In this context, Nora isn't particularly unique or talented.  <br />Go download or borrow cds from the library of some artists you've heard or read good things about. You'll begin to discover a lot of great music. For example, in the jazz realm, try Patricia Barber. She's a bananna split ice cream sundae compared to Nora Jones's vanilla scoop in a cup.
0061015725|1.0|Mr. Crichton may have just shortened the cycle time of book-to-big-screen adaptation while reaching new heights (or lows?) in disappointing readers.  Predictable and mundane plot, boring character development (i.e., none), and disjointed forays into explaining nanotechnology, its pros and cons -- all reasons for potential readers to bypass this experience.  I won't be going to the movies should this content ever make the big screen.  \\"TWO THUMBS DOWN!\\"
B00013PHGS|5.0|I thought that perhaps 4.5 stars would be more appropriate, but I can't select that option, and four is too few. The first track is easy enough to find familiar straight away, but having listened to 'cherry blossom girl' which immediately follows it, i find myself skipping it. Maybe there should be some intro instead...<br />The third track 'run' was initially alienating, listening to the loops rather than the details behind it. suddenly when i recognised these sounds the whole track softened into something more harmonic, and has really grown on me. I won't go through the whole cd track by track, as what is important is how it sits as an album. for me the more 'average' songs are the first and fourth, but altogether it sits wonderfully as an album. though each track sounds complete, they still combine to allow the cd gather momentum, each track teasing as it tails into lounge, with the album culminating in 'alone in kyoto' a mature finale, that somehow seems more poignant having seen the film 'lost in translation'. <br />despite the appearance of this song on the soundtrack for the film, the album itself has become the background music to my life at the moment, the same as 'moon safari' did when first discovered air. damn. i was trying to avoid mentioning it...<br />ps my friend milko says its 'horrible', but he has just apologised for it.
B00006690G|1.0|Think about it. How low has mainstream America gone for Eminem to win a Grammay, something for people who work for it. What does Eminem do? Rhyme over other people's music (which is basically repeatitive beats looped over and over). I mean, rock musicians spend the majority of their time learning how to play instruments, something Eminem does not and cannot do, and also learn to sing instead of talking in the same voice really fast throughout the whole track. The only thing Eminem's good at is rhyming, but Dr. Suess can rhyme, so that's not really a big achievement there. Did you know in Norway, at the Norweigan Grammays, bands like Kovenant and Dimmu Borgir have been nominated (and Kovenant actually won one) Grammays? God, their music is so much better over there... oh well. Rap's just a fad. Soon, we'll make way for a new mainstream.
B0000AFX64|4.0|I would like to say first and foremost that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is a fine movie.  It tells a really good story of the last survivors of the human race after the destruction of their twelve differing home worlds by an evil robotic race known as the Cylons.  Lorne Greene stars as Adama, commander of the last surviving warship Galactica who is charged with leading his people to the safety of the legendary planet Earth.<br />This 1978 pilot was filmed for television and shown, followed by the descision to run it in theatres.  As many have pointed out on this page, this film is not presented in true widescreen format, but rather sports black bars at the bottom and top of the picture which actually cover some of the original footage.  You must keep in mind that this movie was NEVER filmed in widescreen to begin with, seeing that it was made for television.  Several sequences and character moments are dropped from this cut as well to shorten the film to the more traditional running length.  Universal is not cheating anyone here.  Instead, they are presenting the version of the film as it appeared in theatres, altered in format and shortened in length to fit the theatrically wide movie screens we are so accustom to! <br />Ultimately, I would recommend \\"The Complete Epic Series\\" to anyone who fondly remembers BATTLESTAR GALACTICA before advising them to purchase this movie version of the film.  Basically, this is for the major fans only, who may be interested in seeing what the film may have looked like in widescreen  (as close as you will ever get to it in this case) and for those interested in comparing the two differing edits of the overall story.  I would, however, recommend this version of the film for anyone who has never seen the show before.  This is a good way to get the feel of what the series is about without spending too much money!
B00005ASHM|5.0|Greatest Pop/Rock album ever released. Every song is outstanding.  Best song by far is &quot;Thats Not Me.&quot;
B00005V3Z4|5.0|with out giving too much away this film deals with the &quot;what ifs&quot; in life. most of us wonder what would have happend if we'd done something different. this films encapsulates that feeling in an exceptional way and shows us how fragile life is and how close we can come into harms way without ever even knowing. a great film no matter what genre your into, stongly recommended.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This 2nd CD is even better than Josh's first, and that was a great CD itself! Josh's voice itself is an incredible instrument! His talent, especially at a young age, is nothing but awesome! His songs move me, reach inside my heart, &amp; touch me deeply. Some have brought me to tears simply because they are so achingly beautiful. Josh has nowhere to go but up! I eagerly await his next CD! As I said, I also have the 1st CD, including the DVD with the concert from PBS. It's FANTASTIC! And he, unlike other so-called singers, did the most magnificent job of singing at Super Bowl XXXVIII. His song was absolutely the highlight of the entertainment! No one can touch him--Josh has such an incredibly beautiful voice! I don't even mind listening to him sing in other languages...I just love to hear his magnificent instrument of a voice! There's no one else like him &amp; the sky's the limit for him! Thank God for such an amazing voice &amp; talent! Truly breathtaking! I will ALWAYS be a fan (&amp; I'm not young--I'm 43 but his songs transcend age or background). Buy this CD if you love absolutely haunting, achingly beautiful music! You will NOT be disappointed! I can't recommend it highly enough!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I think the title of this cd is ironic...why couldn't they just let the original cd be?  Why fix whats not broken?  Call me crazy, but I like the Phil Spector arrangements.  Some of the songs (Two of Us off the top of my head) are identical which make this almost seem redundant.  The Fly On The Wall bonus disc is cool for a little while...but let's not kid ourselves...the way it's edited and they way the Beatles talked...sometimes it's impossible to figure out what they're talking about.  Still, it's the Beatles and the songs are well done.  Buy it only if you're collecting all the Beatles CDs or you're a Beatles fanatic.
B000089RVX|4.0|Like most debuts &quot;Fallen&quot; isn't perfect.  Ironically, it suffers from being a little uneven and at the same time too homogenous for its own good.  It is, however, the best debut I've heard in a long while and I look forward to their next CD when it becomes available.<br />I'm not sure what marketing genius came up with calling this music hard rock or metal.  In truth it's more like &quot;Enya&quot; meets metal.  It might sound like a strange combination, but it works very well here.  You've heard this before I know, but Lee's mature, and &quot;hauntingly beautiful&quot; voice against a &quot;metal-light&quot; background, (played cleanly incidentally), makes for an interesting and entertaining CD.  Once again, I'd love to hear some more of their stuff once it's a little more polished.<br />This might sound corny but the lyrics are well written, or better yet well authored.  There is some real meaning there without dipping too far into the sappy or melodramatic.  It isn't exactly poetry, but it isn't exactly meant to be either.<br />Overall, this CD has everything it should.  The music is played well, Ms. Lee's voice is superb, it is unique in so far as genre.  A few songs sounded too alike, in my humble opinion, and I couldn't help but think that there is some unfullfilled potential here.  With this blend, I kept waiting for a blockbuster song... it's hard to explain this so bear with me.  They have the potential for an anthem type song.  A memorable song(s) that stands on its own rather than depend on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack.  Few artists nowadays have the potential for anything more memorable than a catchy tune.  You just get the feeling that &quot;Evanescence&quot; is a group that can.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I've seen everything from the awesome &quot;Pulse&quot; by Pink Floyd, The Eagles &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;, everything from the Stones including &quot;Four Flicks&quot;, Eric Clapton's latest, and every other notable band that may come to mind..........But nothing comes close to this delight to the senses. The absolute best live concert DVD I have ever seen or heard.  What an amazing performance!  I hope they come to Australia soon.
0425152251|5.0|To be honest,I'm so impressed w/ the ideas and philosophical theories which are being deliberately carried out throughout the plot.Though,it was the fact that,the characters were not specifically rendered in the novel,it still had the power to make the novel enjoyable on the whole.<BR>I'm actually interested in philosophy but to a certain extent, I don't know how to start it and don't know where can I start it.However,once I started reading this book,I can't stop.It really helps!I recommend it for everyone,especially youngsters.It should be the beginning of our-personal-philosophy_course.After reading it,I really think that philosophy course should be setted as one of the school's syllabus.Every1 needs philosophy.Every1 needs questioning.<BR>So,it's time for you to know about yourself as well as the world you lived in.And,I'm sure u'll enjoy the book!!!Don't miss it!!!*:]
B00006RAKP|5.0|For Elton John, maybe the fifth time is the charm, because here I am reviewing his fifth Greatest Hits album, this time the 1970-2002 variety.  That thought aside, this is (like the others) a fantastic collection of hits from one of the greatest and most popular musicians of our time.  Opening with \\"Your Song\\", this album offers 34 classic songs, from love songs to rockin' tunes,  in a reasonably priced 2 CD set.  For those new to Sir Elton John, Greatest Hits 1970-2002 is a great place to start appreciating his work.  The long-time fans should find this a very comprehensive (unfortunately some gems such as the Tumbleweed Collection album  aren't represented)  set as well, but may be disappointed to find some songs have been slightly edited for this album.  Overall, this is another fine collection of hits from what some argue is the true \\"King of Pop.\\"
B00008EYA5|4.0|I've never watched the TV show and have nothing to compare this to, but I truly enjoyed the film version, &quot;SWAT&quot;.  It had some fun action sequences that just make you want to sit back and enjoy without thinking too hard.<br />As the title suggests, the focus is on the LA SWAT team.  A veteran of the LA police force is given the opportunity to create his own unit and he picks five of the best to join him.  Most of the film is relegated to showing thier training situations while combating the internal pressures to perform.  When they are asked to help transport an international prisoner to a secure facility, however, they are truly put to the test.  Espcially when the prisoner offers $100 million to anyone who can break him out.<br />This movie is best if not taken too seriously.  You will enjoy it if you are a fan of the action genre, that's for sure.  There are several worthwhile extras to make this a DVD worth seeing.
B000002UB6|5.0|Being a huge Beatles fan, it's hard to call this album a mess, but that's exactly what it is.  But come on, it's the Beatles making a mess!  Each song is beautiful in its own way, and although there is some studio hiss and chatter...it makes you feel like you're really in the studio with the Beatles.  Think of it this way, you could do 100000x worse.
0452281881|5.0|Having worked in an office full of gossip and passive-aggressive agendas, every single character in &quot;e&quot; was easy for me to picture. The idea of writing the book as a collection of emails is brilliant, as is the huge dose of sarcasm that the British are known for. I read this book in 2 days, since once the story got rolling, it was hard for me to stop. Good fun.
B0000025ZF|5.0|Are you kidding me? This is by far the best Roger Water's cd out there, if not 1 of the best albums ever made.  Roger made Pink Floyd and his solo work shows it.  Great album.
B0000026T4|5.0|This is a great Alice Cooper album. Poison is a classic. Also, not only does it have great rock 'n' roll hits like the title track, Bed Of Nails, House Of Fire, and Spark In The Dark, but it also has touching strong love songs such as Only My Heart Talkin' and Hell Is Living Without You. A great come back album from Alice Cooper, released in 1989. I promise that you'll enjoy it too if you're an Alice Cooper fan! It's definately my favorite Alice Cooper album, and one of his greatest!

B00005JMCT|3.0|When sequels reach their third installment, it's more like nostalgia or tradition that makes me want to see it.  That's the case with American Wedding.  It doesn't live up to it's hilarious predecessors, but it's still a fun trip with the characters that you've come to enjoy.<br />In this installment, Jim and Michelle plan their wedding, with just a little help from their friends.  What started out as a one-joke character in part one, Stiffler, returns as still a one-joke character.  In this instance, however, he is really over the top to the point that he was no longer funny.  Perhaps that was the intention, however, as it became clear that he was the only member of this cast who hasn't matured in the past four years.  It allowed room for him to grow, and he did, a little bit.<br />While Stiffler is a negative in this film, the other characters were funny and charming as usual.  The storyline fit nicely into the trilogy and made for a fine conclusion.  Unfortunately, sequels are often compared to it's predecessors, and this one fails.  It lacks that one big scene the other two movies had and it lacked some of the sentimental storytelling as well.  <br />While I enjoyed it as a stand alone movie, it's truly for the die-hard American Pie fans.
B0000009SM|5.0|About once a year I take this album out for another round of listening, and am consistently staggered by just how good it is. The catchy melodies made it accessible early on, while the complexity makes it even more rewarding after the (at least) 100th listen. The Po-jama People guitar solo mimics an annoying person yammering away in your ear. The spacy ambience and George Duke's semi-falsetto vocals lend a vibe to Inca Roads just like its title. The phrase &quot;pondered the significance of short person behavior in pedal-depressed pan-chromatic resonance, and other highly ambient domains&quot; is used to express puzzlement at how short people can press the pedals on a panio. Elegantly structured pieces like Sofa, with many variations on the theme and perfect-sounding counterpoints, are there as well. It is simply, IMHO, the greatest single rock or rock-related album ever produced. I'll never tire of listening to it.
B0000256VK|5.0|I'm an early Roxy Music fan and not much of a Brian Ferry fan per se. That said his early solo albums had their moments. But along with Siren and Country Life, Avalon remains one of Ferry's and Roxy's Music's last great efforts.<br /><br />Too slick to be on the cutting edge of its time, it still puts a lot of 80's schmaltz to shame. Despite being a musical time capsule for 1982, it still sounds great. Sweet, brooding & melancholic to say the least. Unlike, a lot of today's Pop Stars, this album has class.<br /><br />\\"More Than This\\" is an absolutely gorgeous start to a windswept Autumn of a record. Ferry wears his jaded romantic schtick well & he plays it to the hilt. Never has it been more fully realized than here. Punk this song out, or strum it alone on acoustic bedsit guitar. It would still ring true. The thing is flawless.<br /><br />\\"The Space Between Us\\" is a big production number if I ever heard one. But it all rings a hollow note beside such sparse & remorseless lyrics. The ultimate break up song. Just when you think the party's over, here comes the unabashed romanticism of of \\"Avalon\\". The instrumental, \\"India\\" gives you some time to catch your breath before the following track. If you're searching for words to live by, \\"I will never lay down while my heart is still beating\\" might just suffice.<br /><br />By far my favorite line on the whole album comes from, \\"Take A Chance On Me\\". Hell, even Christ, Gandhi or MLK would approve of the words, \\"All the world, even you, should love the way I do\\".<br /><br />I can't help thinking of my wife every time I hear, \\"Turn You On\\". That line, \\"Is it raining in New York down 5th Avenue\\" gets me every time when I'm out on tour. And she hates this album! But I keep coming back year after year. Maybe it's a guy thing. I don't know.<br /><br />All I can say is, I find this to be one of the most romantic albums I've ever heard. Rock's answer to Sinatra's Wee Small Hours. True, its' dated in a brass and fern way. But in terms of being in a suspended state of animation it's perfectly preserved. It's only competition is Bowie's Let's Dance. An obvious but brilliant riff off of the trend laid down here. True, Roxy's ground breaking camp brilliance is a thing of the past. And Bryan Ferry has been making the same record for decades. But don't let that stop you from checking out this gorgeously dated masterpiece.ms of being in a suspended state of animation it's perfectly preserved. It's only competition is Bowie's Let's Dance.

0440237688|5.0|Lois Lowry's The Giver is quite a remarkable book; it has something in it for everyone.  I first read the book when I was in Seventh Grade and had re-read it several times before recently reading it again as part of an upper-division college literature course.  I have been fascinated by this seemingly simple novel for so many years-every time I come back to it, I find new ways in which I can apply it to my life.  The Giver is laced with some of the most beautiful symbolism.  In many ways it is alive, the book itself seems to change and adapt to an individuals needs and circumstances.   <br />When I read the book for the first time, I was about the same age as Jonas, the pre-pubescent boy who is to become the most respected leader of his community-The Receiver of Memory.  I could relate to his feelings as he questioned the future and tried to find his place in life.  I read it several times throughout junior high and high school and I became especially aware of the relationships which Jonas had with his friends and family.  As he began to acquire knowledge (memories), he could see just how impersonal and rather meaningless his most cherished relationships were.  This prompted me to develop stronger, more meaningful relationships with those whom I love.  <br />Now, as a college student, I relate to the book in much the same way I did when I was in seventh grade.  I can more fully appreciate Jonas' apprehension about the future and his ability to actually make a difference in the world.  He has powerful emotions, which if left unchecked could be disastrous; so do I.  He has a passion for understanding the people and the world around him; so do I.  He again questions whether or not he can actually make a difference in the world, but gradually begins to see that he can; I am beginning to see that also.  These feelings and emotions are shared by all young men (and presumably young woman also) and Lowry does an amazing job of helping young people realize that they do havegreat potential to change the world for the better.  <br />Along with the symbolic nature of the book, Lowry does an outstanding job of creating a visual feast for the readers of her novel.  As I read it, I become a part of it; I can see so clearly in my mind everything that she is talking about.  One of the most striking examples of this is how she uses color-in a book?-to show how limited this society is.  People in Jonas' community see only in black and white, but occasionally Jonas sees red-on an apple or in the flesh tones of people's skin.  Over time, he begins to see more colors and with the colors come wisdom and understanding of the suppressed nature of his people.  <br />These are the some of the things that make this a powerful and moving book.  The nature and content of the book appeal to so many because it addresses the basic needs of all people.  To sum it all up-a book for all ages with timeless lessons to be learned from it!

0195067142|5.0|I was amazed at what I was reading. Not for the facts of war, which were crude enough and don't need any more telling; I was amazed at how well this man could write. The fact that he could take notes during that action, that he could reveal so openly and humbly his thoughts and fears, his human nature. I believe he didn't go insane thanks to his writing.<br /><br />The importance of this book, what makes it the best book of its genre, is the honesty and humbleness of this man.<br /><br />More than glad for having read this book, I am glad for knowing that people like Sledge have populated this Earth. God bless Sledge.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|In reference to an earlier comment/question regarding the album's title.
B000000OAH|5.0|Despite being almost forgotten by everyone, Jazz is a great album. It's one of the most diverse albuns on Queen's discography, only left-behind by &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, Queen's masterpiece, in terms of diversity of sounds.<br />To have a look at the track is a good way to get to know the album:<br />1 - Mustapha - An arabic music, with some guitar-rock quite audible. Not quite good, but worth listening.<br />2 - Fat Bottomed Girls - A hit! However, the rocky stile of the track is a bit antiquated... <br />3 - Jealousy - A beautiful love ballad... How could this track be forgotten? One of my favourites!<br />4 - Bicycle Race - Magnificently made music! This one will rock you 'till you explode!<br />5 - If You Can't Bet Them - A good music, despite being not one of the best in this album. It's a rock track.<br />6 - Let Me Entertain You - Pure rock, a great music in live shows, like the one recorded in Montreal, in 1984!<br />7 - Dead On Time - Generally, I jump this track, as it is the most &quot;heavy&quot; in the album. However, is not a bad music, for fast rock lovers, Steppenwolf style.<br />8 - In Only Seven Days - Beautiful ballad... I almost fly when listening to this enchanting music!<br />9 - Dreamer's Ball - Another great music, remembering old balls...<br />10 - Fun It - In this one, Roger Taylor sings most of the vocals. Everytime he sings, musics get a heavier touch, and sometimes a strange one. But this one is good, mainly because Freddie also sings<br />11 - Leaving Home Ain't Easy - In the same style than &quot;In Only Seven Days&quot;, only sung by Brian May. Quite beautiful one.<br />12 - Don't Stop Me Now - This one is the pearl of the album, one of the best tracks in all Queen repertory, and one of the best rock songs of all time! I listen to this one many, many times...<br />13 - More of that Jazz - Maybe the worst music of the album, cancelling not-so-well the original album.<br />My cd hasn't got the mixed versions but, even withoutthem, is a great album, worth buying for any price!
B00011RPB0|5.0|This is the quintessential non-obvious film, with non-obvious stars, non-obvious scenes, and a zen-like ambiguity to its ending.  (Please, Ms. Coppola, resist the temptation to do a sequel.)<br />Bill Murray plays the role of his life in the way that Michael Caine played the role of his life in last year's The Quiet American.  It's the role Bill was born to play - and succeeds in blending his brilliant (and well exposed) sense of irony with the dramatic intrpspection he achieved with his self-produced and unloved but brilliant Razor's Edge (1984).<br />Scarlett Johanssen simply IS.  Her zaftig and somewhat unfashionable youthful but confused beauty is unconsciously perfect in this setting.  Rare true joy radiates from certain scenes (dashing across a crowded street for example) in ways which are so genuine, it transcends acting.<br />Watch it for what doesn't happen.  Watch it for the tiniest details of perfection.
B000003S5H|5.0|Everyone should own this album.  It's quite amazing.  Every tune, every note is just bliss.  It is a great CD relax to or enjoy a moment with your loved one.  This album is everything a Masterpeice is meant to be.  I had bought this on accident, just liking the cover.  I know that's stupid, but that's what I did.  I ended up with a free cool poster too!!  Since then I have everything Air as ever released in the US.  And I will continue to get anything Air releases and I will go see them in concert and just appreciate everything moment that I had found them and the wonderful music they make.  I have always loved France and this band shows France is a great country with beautiful music and great films too!!
B00008WJBU|3.0|I didn't know what to expect at first watching Intacto. A movie about people stealing each others' luck would ordinarily sound ridiculous, but despite skating the edge of credibility, Intacto has a lot of style and some scenes of quiet suspense. I am also a huge fan of Max Von Sydow, and he is clearly a standout in this movie as the Jew, a man who is able to convey his uncanny ability to survive deadly games as almost a tragedy. His conversation with the main character Tomas (also very good) is  quite touching. It seems that even though many of the characters in the movie have incredible luck, the luck in the end seems to be more of a curse than a blessing as characters throughout the movie are unable to get enjoyment from their &quot;good fortune.&quot;
0385504209|2.0|If only it didn't go to seed at the end. And if only the prose were better. And if only the sooper-dooper smart characters were actually sooper-dooper smart (at times they acted as if they were characters in a Teen Movie). Yes, thank goodness for Eco.
B00002EPJH|5.0|To finaly hear an album of KJ where he does not have to show of, is in itself an thorougly good experience. To hear his genius on these classic songs are equaly good. Together making this one of his finer album in years. Oh, and the fact that he doesnt moan on this one is for me an improvement.
0060920084|1.0|As I find my self struggling to finish this book, I think Bill Bryson and I have something in common. He should stop traveling, because clearly he does not enjoy it; I should stop reading his negative rants and raves about small town America, because, frankly, it is getting painful. Reading this book has put me in a terribly bad mood -- his negativity is causing me to toss and turn all night, and to meet even the best dreams with sarcastic criticism. I am very disappointed, mostly because I LOVED &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot; Perhaps the travels chronicled in &quot;A Lost Continent&quot; are too fraught with negative childhood memories, and he can't get over it and enjoy some of the amazing experiences he could have had. I want to write my own book, &quot;The Lost Bill Bradley: The trip that could have been.&quot; I'll re-trace his steps, and show the world all the great things he missed. Skip this book, but I would encourage you to read &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; which is really rather enjoyable. I only hope that &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; (which I also bought based on my feelings about &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;) is better.
B00013PHGS|5.0|\\"Is there anybody out there?\\"  That's truly how you feel when listening to this album.  You feel as if you are alone, but you are not, there is someone there, watching you, listening, loving.  It's just amazing.  Things come to mind when you here tunes like Mike Mills, Alpha Beta Gaga, and of course Alone in Kyoto.  They are the past and they are the future. I bought this Cd into work to listen to it, at first they said it was \\"gay music\\" I quickly ignored them.  But then Alpha Beta Gaga came on all of a sudden they were whistling the tune.  That shows you that Air came move even the slowest and dumbest people out there.  Who are quickly to judge something just by how it sounds or what it appears to be. <br /> Every song is a masterpeice.  At first I was doubtful about this album, mainly because I was afraid it might be too short or not as good as Moon Safari.  I was hoping they were going to release City Readings with out the Author speaking.  Sorry I don't speak Italian and it's hard to listen to the CD sometimes, but still it's great!!  But when I was listening to Walkie Talkie it became clear that this album is a treasure.  It's just as good as any thing they have released to date (even Everybody Hertz is pretty good...I like the People in the City video on it).  I've been a fan of Air since I accidently bought Moon Safari and I will always be a fan of them, through high and low.  They are coming to Phoenix, which is close to where I live, and I am going to do everything in my power to go see them this time!
B000002J09|5.0|listen to going to california...oh and also every other song on the cd! YOU&quot;LL BE IN LED ZEP HEAVEN!
0553579908|2.0|My problem with CofKings is the same with the other books(I'm on Storm of Swords at the moment);I find the authors copied (or perhaps influenced) technique of changing the character at the end of every chapter prevents me from really getting into the characters or the book.Some of these characters are quite boring and it's frustrating when you've read 5 or 6 pages of a character like Jon Snow,are just getting into it and suddenly the chapter ends with sometimes a quite contrived formulaic hook.Then you turn the page and the next chapter is entitled 'Catlyne' and you groan inwardly.All of these books are written like this and I will persevere and finish them but,my god,they're hard work.No depth to the characters or storyline.The names of the chief characters are different but we still have the trekking from one place to the other-prisoners escaping and trekking,children escaping and trekking,trekking,trekking! Heroes being outnumbered two to one but winning etc.I've recently read a novel (Birdsong) about WW1 and the depth of characters and reality of the battlescenes puts Mr Martin to shame.Perhaps I've just read too many fantasy books and I should switch genres-I will complete his serier first though but I won't recommend them to you!
B000002KET|5.0|What a great album from start too finish.  from the the hard riff of sabbath bloody sabbath right through too the beautiful spiral architect this is a more mellow but refined effort from sabbath ozzys voice is going higher than it ever has before and ever will.  It belongs in all hard rock and heavy metal collections cheers
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is Quentin's best movie to date.  There are so many influences in this movie that make it outstanding.  I haven't been one who enjoys Hong Kong flicks or Samurai movies from Japan.  But after seeing this my horizon has been opened up.  I have like anime, Miyazaki is one of my all time favorite directors.  But after seeing this movie.  I took a closer look at Kurosawa movies, even though they aren't exactly the make influence, but I see them in Kill Bill.  Also I love the touch of Italian Westerns in this movie.  The soundtrack is the best out there.  So many tunes I've never heard or heard like that!  I have seen this movie once in theaters, but I will buy the dvd when it comes out.  I will see Kill Bill Vol. 2 and I will buy it on dvd.  Then I will buy the dvd box set of them both with a really great bonus I heard will be with it!!  If you thought the Matrix Series sucked, or you just didn't get it.  Don't see this, I don't think it will help you.  I suggest go see Message in a Bottle.  You'll probably like that.  Yeah, that sounds good to me.  You'll enjoy it!!  Who can't, Kevin Costner is in it!!  Or if you want a voilent movie I suggest you see Cabin Fever.  But if you like QT, then see this movie.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I just wanted to say thanks to Blossom Burkitt and the wonderful review she (I assume &quot;she&quot;) wrote for Mulholland Drive.  Because of you I understand the movie MUCH better than before.  The most I would have been willing to give this movie before reading your review was maybe three or three and half stars out of five but now that it's all in perspective I can very comfortably award it five stars.  I think it's Lynch's best film period, superior to Blue Velvet.  But hey, that's just me.  Again, thanks.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I didn't think of getting this because I already had the DVD and most of their studio albums already. But once I heard it, I was amazed and had to get it. I suggest that anyone who likes Led Zeppelin buy this album, or at least get a chance to hear it. And don't listen to &amp;quot;turkey&amp;quot; guy, I wouldn't trust a review from anyone who would prefer Duran Duran over Zeppelin.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|An enjoyable film where nothing really happens.  Well acted and shot.
0385504209|5.0|It's an enticing mystery with strong historical and factual roots. Consider it the new version of based on a true story. Like a history lesson that you wish you had in school. I must warn allot a good weekend to this book because unlike the cliche that once you pick it up you won't put it down, this book actually does just so.
B00006IU73|4.0|I, like a few other reviewers, found Porcupine Tree through Opeth.  Well actually, this album was recommended to me on CDNOW, but when I heard Steven Wilson was working with Opeth, I figured he was probably a pretty smart guy.  Well, I actually managed to find a copy of this at Best Buy, and while I was actually expecting some more inspired lyrics, I was very much impressed with the music.  Now, I intentionally gave it four stars because, a) this type of music generally isn't at the top of my list of favorites, and b) there aren't enough differentiating characteristics in the songs.  It's not like listening to one hour-long repetitive song like nu-metal is, but it sounds like a few of the tracks are a continuation of the previous.  This is not really a major annoyance, because as I mentioned, the sound structures are magnificent.  The music is mostly similar to what Wilson did with Opeth on that band's acoustic album Damnation, complete with Mellotrons and giving off a very '70s prog feel.  However, unlike the aforementioned Opeth effort, there are moments where the band lets loose and goes into 'metal mode,' and if you thought these guys could only do more mellow stuff well, you'll rethink your assumption.  The musicianship is excellent, and Wilson is actually a vocalist worthy of a nod and a tip of the hat.  I don't have a favorite track yet, as they're all pretty good.  Definitely something to get if you're tired of meaningless industry slop and are looking for talent in music.
078401213X|2.0|it truley saddens me when people who watch a messed up movie automatically believe for some reason it is great... the thing is this movie is so far beyond boring that i was forcing myself to watch the whole thing hoping (i don't know why) that the movie would get better but it didn't!!!! this movie had a good idea but it seems the director foudn the most boring, annoying and dificult way to tell his story.  story tellers should find somewhat interesting ways to tell there idea or theory so that the audience will listen attentively and be motiviated to look deeper, however with this movie it is far too boring so i drifted off many times. This was nothing short of a waste of time.. precious time that i will never get back and that also deepens my loathing for this horrible movie.  <br />Do not be fooled by the great reviews or the bad ones for that matter.. if you have the patience for movies that move rather slowly, like horrible music and have the tolerance to watch a movie on bad quality black and white flim then don't let me tell you different. To tell the truth it had an interesting idea but was badly portrated and for that is a waste. <br />P.s. Weird and unordinary does not necessairly = greatness
0385504209|2.0|Yeah, this book keeps you going, and it's probably great for a long plane ride, but my god, do a better job with the writing and the characters!  These characters are supposed to be solving the 'greatest secret of all time' and yet they are completely clueless. Some of the least imaginative writing to make the best seller lists.  And just for perspective, I am not Christian and have no opinion on either side of the Jesus/Mary Magdalene debate.  If you like conspiracy theories and secret societies, go read Eco's Foucault's Pendulum.  Now THERE is a book!
B00004TDTO|5.0|What can I say? I'm speechless! No doubt one of the top 10 greatest movies of all time! I still till this day will not go in the ocean. Highly recommended!
B00005UK1F|5.0|Well Tchort, you're no longer just a sick dude who used to play in one of those black metal bands (yeah, I called Emperor 'just one of those black metal bands')!  You're now a fantastic composer and a brilliant musician.<br />Light of Day, Day of Darkness... what can I say that hasn't been said already?  Well, if there was one thing I didn't like, and mind you, there is ONE thing I don't like about it, it's the female vocalist, Synne Soprana.  Very bad girl!  She doesn't really do any kind of lead vocals, but they're not ambience vocals either.  She just makes noises for part of it.  But aside from that, and keep in mind some folks may adore her style so this is just a matter of opinion, this is musical magnificence.  I mean, a saxophone in a metal band?  Only here could that work out so perfectly.  There are elements of just about every kind of music you could think of, save for pop, rap, and country.  Honestly, I don't know how to describe to you just how amazing this song (it feels so weird saying 'song' instead of 'album' or 'CD'!) really is.  You've got to hear it for yourself.  This is possibly the most marvelous piece of contemporary music ever written; if Beethoven or Mozart or Rachmaninoff or Berlioz or any of the other greats were still alive today, I think they'd be giving Mr. Tchort one hell of a pat on the back!
0446310786|5.0|when you first get to kill a mocking bird you say what a dumb book this is. but when you start reading it you want to go on and on until you get to the end of the book. this book grabs your attention in the second chapter and never lest your mind go. so  if you think to kill a mocking bird is boring think again.
B0000028SR|4.0|The Boss,aka Bruce Springsteen returns after a five-year hiatus with this album along with LUCKY TOWN. In that time,he married his E Street Band background vocalist Patti Scialfa and had a few kids with her. As I said in the review for LUCKY TOWN,this album had no more sales success than its twin. The title track was a Top 10 hit and was later recycled for 1995's GREATEST HITS. 57 CHANNELS(AND NOTHIN' ON) just has a bass guitar. PONY BOY,the last track is a subtle cool-down. Scialfa sang background on that one. All the other songs are good.
B00005JL9B|1.0|This movie was a major dissapointment. It's one of those movies that leave you feeling ripped off at the end. The acting was BAD. The plot was awesome, thats why I wonder how they screwed it up so bad. I guess it started with one of the \\"bad\\" kids who had a machine gun that never ran out of ammo throughout the whole movie. And having the ability to \\"blow off(so they said)\\" any ones head at any time, this should have happened more than once. And when it did happen the student should have latched on to the teacher and taken him down also. LONG AND BORING AND STUPID AND NOT VIOLENT AND YOU BE YOUR OWN JUDGE> THIS IS JUST ONE MANS OPINION.
B000055X3U|3.0|I don't really care for this CD.  Don't know why, I just don't.  I was fairly impressed when I heard the song &quot;Deep&quot; as a sample, and I like that song a lot, but nothing else on the album really struck me.  There's no really crappy songs on it; nothing that makes me want to vomit after hearing it, it's just that I can't really get into it.  Everything is at about the same pace, same tempo, same everything.  Normally, that doesn't bother me too much, but this time it did.  I'm reading a lot of good reviews, and thinking to myself, 'I should be giving this five stars too, but I don't like it.'  Well, I've always been accused of having bad taste in women, could that be filtering over to my taste in music???  I hope not.  Anyway, I advise taking my review for what it's worth, but concentrate on the other reviewers' comments.
B0000024W3|5.0|For nearly 40 years, we have had to listen to people complain that this is &quot;Dylan's worst album.&quot; Even Dylan himself said so. All I have to say is this: Dylan at his worst is still better than most people at their best! Not only is this NOT a terrible album, it's actually a GOOD album. Full of nice songs like &quot;Alberta #1 &amp; #2,&quot; &quot;Livin The Blues,&quot; and &quot;I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know.&quot; His cover of Lightfoot's &quot;Early Morning Rain,&quot; was purportedly supposed to be Bob Dylan making fun of Gordon Lightfoot...yet is still a great cover. &quot;Wigwam&quot; sounds kind of like Bob Dylan meets Ray Conniff, but it is a great little wordless tune which fit perfectly into the soundtrack of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS. My favorite is &quot;Belle Isle,&quot; which is as beautiful a song as Dylan ever sang. Even his cover of &quot;The Boxer,&quot; while disjointed, is far from unlistenable. I have heard that Bob Dylan and Paul Simon strongly dislike each other...I don't know if that is true or not (can anyone confirm?), but listening to that song in that context actually makes it a little more enjoyable. Sure, there are a few less stellar cuts on this album, but let's remember something: THIS WAS A DOUBLE ALBUM. There were a lot of double albums coming out in this era, and most of them had both great stuff and not-so-great stuff on them. Cases in point: Beatles White Album, Bee-Gees Odessa, Chicago Transit Authority, Elton John Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Dylan's own BLONDE ON BLONDE and BASEMENT TAPES...all of these are great double albums...but I don't think any double album (nor single album, for that matter) is excellent all the way through. It is the nature of the beast. <BR>Even the follow-up to this album, DYLAN, is not nearly as bad as people say it is.<br />The bottom line: if you like Dylan, you will find something on this album to enjoy.
B000002B30|5.0|Here are fourteen of Bruce Springsteen's GREATEST HITS with 4 new songs. They are entitled SECRET GARDEN,MURDER INCORPORATED,BLOOD BROTHERS and THIS HARD LAND. This album was released in 1995,spanning two decades of Springsteen's career. He and Columbia Records labelmate Billy Joel are just two of the biggest-selling artists of all time. They both wrote almost every song they ever recorded. Now for the songs: BORN TO RUN and THUNDER ROAD are from 1975's BORN TO RUN,the album that drove Springsteen to superstardom. BADLANDS is from 1978's DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN. From 1980's THE RIVER,Springsteen's first megahit,come THE RIVER and HUNGRY HEART. From 1982's NEBRASKA comes ATLANTIC CITY,which tells about the New Jersey town,famous for its gambling facilities. From BORN IN THE U.S.A.,Springsteen's second megahit released in 1984 come BORN IN THE U.S.A.,GLORY DAYS,DANCING IN THE DARK and MY HOMETOWN. From TUNNEL OF LOVE,his third megahit released in 1987,is BRILLIANT DISGUISE. From HUMAN TOUCH and LUCKY TOWN,simultaneously released in 1992,are HUMAN TOUCH and BETTER DAYS,respectively. STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA is from the movie &quot;Philadelphia&quot; starring Tom Hanks,released in December '93 or January '94. The rhythm of that song inspired Natalie Merchant's 1998 hit,KIND &amp; GENEROUS(Springsteen and Merchant are both managed by Jon Landau). I would suggest Springsteen release a Greatest Hits 2 with songs like,TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT,PROVE IT ALL NIGHT,ADAM RAISED A CAIN,ROSALITA,FADE AWAY,RAMROD,THE TIES THAT BIND,COVER ME,I'M ON FIRE,I'M GOIN' DOWN,TUNNEL OF LOVE,ONE STEP UP,LUCKY TOWN,57 CHANNELS(AND NOTHIN' ON),YOUNGSTOWN and any hits from his most recent album,THE RISING.

I was initially attracted to the book because I have an autistic nephew, much younger than Christopher, and I wanted to try in some small way to see the world through his eyes.  I got so much more!  The characters were all very wonderfully, believable.  All of them just trying, in their own ways, to make it through life the best they can.  One minute I would be laughing at some wonderfully wise remark made by Christopher and the next minute I would have to put the book down for a minute because I so dreaded something really bad was going to happen to Christopher. The best thing I can say - I didn't want the book to end.  At the last page, I was crying, and thinking, &quot;God I hope he writes a sequel.  I want to know how Christopher's life goes on.&quot;
B0000A4GAK|4.0|Derek Trucks is an incredible musician.  He brings virtuosity, taste, variety, and great musicians with him every time he releases an album. And I have all of them.<br />Derek Trucks comes in many flavors.  Some of these flavors are nice, interesting, educational, etc.  The blues flavor is my favorite.  So, each album has only a few songs that I really like.  Yet, I like those songs so much that I listen to them over and over.  And, those songs provide all the value I need to buy the album.<br />In the &quot;Soul Serenade&quot; album, there are two songs that provide that value: Drown In My Own Tears (which has enough value for the whole album) and Soul Serenade.<br />I played this album for some good friends who love the jazz flavor.  They loved it so much that I gave it to them.  I had to buy myself another copy to replace it.
B0000YEEGM|4.0|A great movie but mediocre special edition.  1 deleted scene, 3 commentaries, some photos, a 7 minute making off from 1988(mostly scenes from the movie itself) and about 20 'other great MGM titles available' trailers, dvd trailers and dvd covers and that's it basically.  MGM seem more interested in self promotion on this disc (the first thing shown is a 10 second MGM promo with scenes from recent DVD releases).  This is very annoying.  I'd rather just get the movie and the material RELATING to the movie.  If I want to know what else is coming out, I'll seek it out myself--it's not that hard.  MGM seem to think we won't find out about thier movies unless they tack on this extra unnecessary stuff.  This is why I don't rent movies often, being forced to sit through 10 minutes of movie previews or fast forwarding(luckily this disc does not have that but Universal is getting pretty good in that department).  A Great movie with great acting but I honestly don't think this should be called a special edition because you slap on a few commentaries a quick deleted scene and an old 7 minute promowhatchamacallit.  Also,  there is no booklet...! MGM seems to do that a lot with their 'catalog releases'. At least it beats the previous DVD version.
B0000028SU|4.0|This album spawned only two Top 10 hits,BETTER DAYS and the title track. That's why I entitled this review &quot;A not-so LUCKY TOWN&quot;. However,country star Faith Hill covered IF I SHOULD FALL BEHIND several years later. All the other songs are pretty good. This album's twin,HUMAN TOUCH had no more sales success than this. I'm not saying either album flopped,but neither was a megahit like THE RIVER,BORN IN THE U.S.A. and TUNNEL OF LOVE.
B00000JLWW|4.0|The cast, sets, costumes, music are all excellent. This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The romance abounds and the story is interesting. We begin with an elederly lady relaying her experience on the Titanic to a diving crew that are in search of it and in particular a necklace that was on her.<br /><br />As the lady relates her story we find out about an incredible experience she had aboard and how she is directly related to that necklace. The incredible acting, costumes, and music make us feel we are there. The romance and trajedy draw us into a bittersweet tragedy. As the story draws to a close we find out she still possesses the necklace. And here is when I think the story writer had drain bamage.<br /><br />She tosses it overboard in remembrance of her lost love. Sorry but if I was that lad she loved and that had died saving her, her tossing me the trinket all those years later would not make it romantic. She should have given it to the people that were searching for it and spent so much to find it, the ones that took her back to the Titanic, the ones that intently listened to her story, the ones that helped her move on. So maybe I'm the only one that thinks there should have been an alternate ending but that's my humble opinion.

B0000VAFO0|2.0|I'll admit, I'm a sucker for a movie involving the world of vampires. Maybe it's the exquisite hedonism.  Maybe it's my curiosity of that &quot;culture.&quot;  Maybe it's just the beautiful makeup effects. However, I expected so much more with this movie.  <BR>The whole love story that was built up between the two major characters was a major let down in being that for starters, Beckinsale and Speedman didn't come across as having any real chemistry.  Also, the love story plot was barely touched upon when I felt they tried to sale the movie on that focal point.<BR>The music/score was tacky and somewhat cliched for this movie and while I'm tempted to say the same for the costuming and setting, I liked the lighting used for the movie.<BR>There was a twist at the end that was interesting, but predictable.  My only hope is that a sequel doesn't follow.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Okay Ben Affleck, no more movies for you.  This movie was horrendous.  No, I'm not a fan of the comics, and wouldn't want to be after realizing this is such a dull super hero.  Ben Affleck is terrible, as always.  Jennifer Garner, who only looks like she does on the cover after she gets mad, fights a bunch of sand bags that miraculously fall from her ceiling and goes out and almost gets instantly killed by Bullseye. (so I heard she's not really dead, I just hope there's not a sequel so I can find out)  The effects were so AWFUL. Does anyone realize that CG effects are almost never well done? (Except in LOTR and anything that Spielberg uses them in)  And the character of Daredevil...so when you're blind you can jump real high?  Yeah don't waste you money.
0345350499|5.0|This book took me two years (because of so many starts and start-overs) to read, but once I finally got down to it and went all the way though I was amazed!  Enthralling and really just beautiful, the Mists of Avalon is deffinitely a must read for anyone not only because of its literary beauty (Bradley is truly talented) but because how archetypal and allegorical it is.  Everything works and all of the characters are so amazingly developed they jump off of the page.  Dynamic, Mists probably should be read by everyone.

0061015725|1.0|Horror and suspense authors can relax; this book just did not instill fear the way one would expect from author Michael Crichton. It is difficult to feel the sense of reality that is so necessary for a good suspense novel, as tiny nanoparticles of some experiment escape from a quiet lab in the Nevada Desert. These nanoparticles take on life like qualities and chase people around sucking the life out of them. Continually evolving, they change both shape and Modus Operandi with every turn of the page, leaving the reader not quite willing to submit to the usual spine tingler. I read this book in 2 days and could have read it in one if I had pushed it, but it just bored me. I also had the &quot;twist&quot; figured out long before the ending.
B00009TB5G|4.0|I like it very much. Please try.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Here is a thought experiment:  close your eyes and visualize the cast and crew of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; on location in Tokyo.  They're having the time of their lives, staying in a swank hotel and hanging out in trendy clubs after a hard-day's shooting.  Bill Murray keeps everyone laughing and the Japanese staff do everything they can to keep thing comfortable and happy.<br />Open your eyes and ask yourself:  if this group of &quot;gaijin&quot; (foreigners) could come to Tokyo and thoroughly enjoy the experience, why should we, the audience, take the plight of the film's characters seriously in any way?  While Bill Murray's aging star with a strained marriage is believable, Scarlett Johannsen's post-grad ennui is contrived and out of place.  This is particularly apparent in the apaprent ease with which she is able to transition from self-pity to full party mode when she heads out to hit the Tokyo club scene (probably a more accurate account of the actual filming of this movie).<br />That two sophisticated, well-educated and (in Murray's character's case) well-traveled individuals can't enjoy themselves in Tokyo is simply not believable, regardless of the personal baggage they might be carrying with them.<br />Furthermore, the depiction of the Japanese professionals with whom they come in contact as unable to converse in English or provide the necessary translation services is simply stereotyping in the service of plot.  Ask anyone who has ever traveled to Japan for business and pleasure and they will tell you that finding people who speak very good English is easy.<br />Finally, Murray and Johannsen's characters adopt an air of detached superiority to their surroundings and to their fellow American travelers that is intended to provide comic relief and increase the audience's sympathy for them as &quot;sensitive souls&quot;.  But it comes across as prigishness - one wonders why Giovanni Rabisi's character can zip all over Japan having a terrific time while his ennui-ridden wife prefers to hide in her room reading self-help books.<br />My apologies to those who find this film compelling and authentic, but as someone who has spent years in Asia and travels for a living, I found the film trite, contrived and condescending to the Japanese.<br />The only saving feature is Bill Murray's reliable depth of character and self-deprecating humor.  He does a yeoman's job in a film otherwise weighted down with a phony sense of gravitas.his ennui-ridden wife prefers to hide in her room reading self-help books.<br />My apologies to those who find this film compelling and authentic, but as someone who has spent years in Asia and travels for a living, I found the film trite, contrived and condescending to the Japanese.<br />The only saving feature is Bill Murray's reliable depth of character and self-deprecating humor.

B000002MTR|5.0|For best Chili's cd. The two are also in my top ten albums of all time. This is the darkhorse of the Chili's album catalogue and seems to be the one that no one likes. I really don't see why. First of all, contrary to popular belief, Dave Navarro is an absolutely amazing guitarist. However, he gets bashed on because he's not John Frusciante. Why? No one cared that Frusciante wasn't Hillel Slovak! Secondly, people complain that this cd is too repetitive. Why?! This is perhaps one of the most diverse cds the Peppers have ever created. Flea sings on some songs including a solo piece. A New guitar player. Music borrowed from almost every genre and capitalized on. This cd spans alternative ( Aeroplane, Deep Kick), Metal (Coffee Shop, Warped), Modern Rock ( My Friends) Experimentation (Pea, Walkabout) and thats only like half the cd! This cd takes you on a musical journey and is lushly diverse from start to finish. If only they would've kept Dave for even one more album, that would have been incredible. But this is perhaps the Chilis at their creative peak, save BSSM. Absolutely essential listening.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown must admire Umberto Eco.  A lot.  Museums late at night, Knights Templar, the &quot;Secret&quot;, the professor pulled into a mystery wrapped in an enigma, a secretive Catholic society. Umberto did it better.  But Dan's book is OK, however the prose is, um, easy to read.  It read more like a move script outline to me than a book.  He also presents LOTS of speculation as fact but that is the fun part - are these speculations in fact true?  Are the Freemasons protecting a secret the Knights discovered while they drive around in gocarts wearing fez hats at a 4th of July parade?  Or just hooey?  Read Eco's Foucalt's Pendulum and really delve into multiple, head-spinning conspiracies head first.  Conspiracies that dry up when discovered because of the twisted logic of the believers.  (I'll reveal no more.)  It has a much creepier atmosphere and writing that will make you smile.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Music isnt money.  There's not much more you can say.  She treats her music like a buisness.  She wrights a couple words in like 3 songs but for the most part she cant wright lyrics.  She cant make the music.  She can sing.  She can dance. She can do buisness.  She can look sexy.  She is proof that anyone can get famous if they want the money that much.  She is a disgrace to music.
B00013PHGS|5.0|I wrote a lengthy review condemning this cd because of its copy-protection.  Well, I took all of your advice and bought it anyway and...I haven't had a problem...soooooo, this cd rocks, please disregard my earlier review!
B00005JLT5|5.0|....Should have been FOUR, Another for Best Picture. A Great and Important movie!
B00005QW5X|5.0|'Hedwig' is a wonderfully seductive, twisted, and engaging musical in the true cult spirit of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Those who do not like it, are the ones that aren't sophisticated enough to understand it. The characters and humor are very subtle. Much of the story is told in retrospect, to the tune of a wildly energetic, yet thoroughly thoughtful, soundtrack of original glam rock songs. But what impressed me more than the story, the humor, and the music...was the incredible thought-provoking dialogue. Though I recommend this movie very highly, I would suggest renting it before you buy it...just to make sure you like it.
6301797906|1.0|John Steinbecks book is the most beautiful book ever written and this movie is an abomination. It is completly different from the book and if someone really wants to know the story, READ THE BOOK!!!!!!
1401300901|2.0|I bought this book, the premise sounded like something I would really like. I also noticed some pretty good reviews.I was very surprised at how much I didn't like it. I couldn't even get through the whole book. The writing was immature and shallow, and very repetitive. Maybe I am too old for the type of book, although I do like some of the new &quot;chick lit&quot;. I am going to send it to someone else, and let her try it, maybe it was just me.Anyway, if you are reading this review, maybe you should try to get a copy from the library, or borrow one, or even wait for paper. I hate writing bad reviews, I would just rather not say anything at all,but here it is with apologies to the author.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|I got a glipse of them through a commercial, and I liked it, and nothing was going to stop me from just logging onto their website and completely listening to &quot;Unholy Confessions&quot; and I continued to like it. So, I decided to buy the album with some gift card I had somewhere under my bed and realized that the album was good, but maybe they could just be a little more open minded to the melody and music, it all sounded kind of the same. But I mean it's a good record. Go nuts.
B00006JKON|4.0|When I first heard that Tull were issuing remasters of a sizable chunk of their studio albums, I was as cynical as most of the songs on this CD.  True, there have been plenty of advances in the fields of recording / mixing / mastering in the decades since the original releases, but I can't believe that the engineers got it all wrong the first time around...However, I decided to bite on this one for a number of reasons:<br />-- My cassette version was wearing thin.<BR>-- There are a whopping 7 bonus tracks, including 2 of my favorites, &quot;Rainbow Blues&quot; and &quot;Glory Row&quot;, which had previously only been available on rip-off Best Of compilations.<BR>-- I had never heard &quot;Warchild Waltz&quot; before (was far too young to see Tull when they toured in support of this album).<br />All that said, this remaster is STUNNING.  The clarity on this CD gave me a whole new appreciation of each song.  Of course, I never really liked &quot;Ladies&quot; or &quot;Back Door Angels&quot; (still not sure why they kept the latter as such a staple in live performances for so long), and still don't, which prevents me from giving this a fifth star.<br />I also bemoan the fact that most of these songs will never see the light of day again in live performance due to Ian's promise never to play saxophone again.  Thankfully, we now have this remaster to keep gems like &quot;SeaLion&quot; and the title track fresh in our memory banks.
B00003CX5P|2.0|After a long, long wait, many of us finally got to jump into theatres and watch the beginning of a fantastic tale about good and evil. <br /> The film suddenly starts with master Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his younger apprentice, the up and coming Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). They are sent by the Senate to negotiate with the Trade Federation, on board one of their many battle ships that illegally surrounds the Naboo system. The Jedi are distracted as a group of delegates and Vice Roys ploy a plot. I thought that there would be some slick looking villans in vests and gear. Instead, we have three human sized guppies with robes that Hugh Hefner would love and head dresses that look worse than Burger King paper party crowns. They order the Jedi to be killed.<br />Right after I realized who the Trade Federation leaders were, my stomach began to turn in frustration. The worry sat in quick. <br />Their assasins are an armed group of popsicle stick-limbed droids that say hardly anything than, &quot;Roger-roger!&quot; and who's rusty voices are in serious need of WD-40. These guys are the enemy? Our two lightsaber wielding Jedi slice and dice them better than a 'Ginsu' can chop celery, and make their way down to the planet that's already been invaded. Their run in with a clumsy reptillian-man named Jar-Jar (and a jar head he is) starts to water this film down quickly. There's no big threatening villans, no eerie mystery, only characters that are paper thin and a story that's got too much to deal with at once.   <br />They find the captured Queen Amidala (a bland Natalie Portman) and take her (with two tag teams of hand maidens) to space, and after an outboard R2-D2 (what's he doing in this???) saves their cruiser's shields from a Federation ship's barrage of lasers, they make their emergency escape to Tatooine. <br />The title is still something everyone wonders about, and I gave the movie the benefit of doubt that he's a soon to be. So, on with the show. <br />Anakin Skywalker, is discovered. A slave to a gang of Hutts, him and his mother, along with nearly completed C3-P0 (oh, brother) help the outlanders win their needed parts in a pod race that's better than Days Of Thunder! Anakin is only freed, but encouraged by his mother to go and seek out a life with the Jedi. <br />The emotional impact or character development is pushed aside by fancy creature spottings and errand-like tasks that everybody is doing from the beginning. You don't get to know anybody at all, and the actors (minus a lame Portman and tin can Jake Lloyd) really try their best at a script that gives them 'a job to do'. The animation and effects are truly spectacular. With an Oscar nod again for that department, they keep up their 'Ind. Light And Magic' legacy. <br />Then there's the Phantom Menace. &quot;Phantom&quot; is right. Except for the last half hour, you don't see or hear him, minus a minute here, and a minute there. Worthy of the movie's title? No way. He does pack a whollop in a sabre duel with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan that can rival all three of the original trilogy's sabre fights COMBINED, with great choreography that was much needed before. The Jedi council is so underused, and Yoda goes from a wise yet funny little green eared Jedi to a grouch on a chair. On the other hand, Watto, the small grumpy swindler who runs the parts shop, is a blue winged creature with a hairy nosed trunk. He is the funny one, not Jar-Jar, and talks like he comes from an Italian pasta place. I do find McGregor to be a well played and placed dead ringer for a young Obi-Wan, so kudos to George Lucas there. <br />All of the humour, filmmakers stying and magic that built the original episodes are lost in this boring entry that was suppose to introduce us to their world with depth, and not just push them into view. <br />Great effects, shallow script writing, and uninvolved moviemaking are all that 'Phantom Menace' gives. The force, is not with this one.
6300213714|4.0|&quot;The Warriors&quot; starring Michael Beck is a street gang version of a Navy shore leave gone horribly wrong.  The Warriors are a nine-member Coney Island street gang that take the train to the Bronx under a flag of truce.  They are attending a New York Citywide gang powwow -- their first trip out of Coney Island.  Cyrus, the largest NYC gang's leader, is assassinated at the powwow and the assassins blame the Warriors.  The Warriors must fight their way back to Coney Island chased by the New York City Police and every other New York City street gang.<br />&quot;The Warriors&quot; is a testosterone-filled cult film that concentrates on the gang members' return odyssey.  The Warriors are unarmed and outnumbered, and everybody wants to play -- fists, chains, clubs, knives and guns.  The Warriors' caution is tempered by the exhilaration of new places -- exhilaration that brings additional trouble.<br />Citywide street gang unity is an interesting and significant film theme (&quot;An American Mogadishu&quot;?).  This 1979 film features street gang coordination over a gang-run FM broadcast radio station.  Speculating how today's street gangs use Internet-accessible text-enabled cellular telephones and Internet chat rooms is interesting.<br />IMO &quot;The Warriors&quot; is a heroic epic film.  And IMO &quot;The Warriors&quot; is less violent than traditional Western or war films, &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot; or other common 21st Century television fare.
0440416027|5.0|Skellig was one of my favorites. It had suspense and a great ending. Skellig is not only human but bird and angel as well. he seems like a bad person. A mean person. In this book it shows that in every bad situation there will be a hero. Micheal was a very interesting character. he showed courage and curiousity throughout the book. my favorite character was Mina. She is open-minded with a great out look on life. for example, have u ever wondered why you have shoulder blades? when u read this book you will think about it. i reccommend this book to anyone and everyone. Just remember to be open minded and you will enjoy this fantastic book.
B00006HB4E|5.0|Absolutely Hilarious movie.  Picture all the crazy funny mayhem from the first, and triple it.  It is so much fun and the new characters are great.  There becomes genetic experimentation and the creation of new types of Gremlins.  Entirely hilarious.  Absolutely amazing.  Buy it.  Most definetly.
0385504209|3.0|I was really excited by this book and it's subject matter when I first came across it at Amazon. After the first couple of chapters I was drawn in and could not put it down. However, after the initial excitement of learning about a new subject wore off I realized this book was actually very dull and predictable. I found myself reading just to get to the end. And a wholly unsatisfying end at that.
B000089RVX|4.0|Hello, before my review I would like to clarify that I am Christian, and after my initial review I like to say a word to Christian readers/listeners/viewers etc, but feel free to only read the beginning of my review. :)<br />***<br />This CD was quite an interesting experience, I decided that in light of all the attention it had received it might be interesting to see what kind of material it included. I will say right up front that I liked this CD very much in general.<br />The songs (please note that what the songs are talking about is only my opinion):<br />1. Going Under: This song seems to be speaking about being overcome, perhaps by someone who in fact owes the speaker something. It is an intense song and the first I ever heard of Evanescence.<br />2. Bring Me To Life: A song about someone dying or falling into their own darkness with no way out. It really seems to be a plea for help. This is one of my favorite songs of theirs not only for its powerful music but also the choice of lyrics, though sometimes they strike me as a little over-dramatic.<br />3. Everybody's Fool: This song is very unique, a song about someone admired (an actor, singer, model) who appeared to love the speaker but only ever puts on a show. Millions of people see her as perfect when he (the speaker) knows who she really is. It's very insightful and the beat is persistent. One warning though, this song will get stuck in your head! ;)<br />4. My Immortal: Another favorite, this song is the speaker singing about losing someone they dearly loved. It made me cry the first time I heard it but I am partial to piano solos; a very soulful song.<br />5. Haunted: This song has never been much of a favorite, the point of the song seems lost in the creepy music and all it seems to be talking about is someone haunting the speaker...whatever that means. But it has a little merit like all of the songs on the album and may appeal to you.<br /><br />6. Tourniquet: This song seems to be from the prospective of someone committing suicide only to discover that they need to be saved In case you don't know, a 'Tourniquet' is a bandage with pressure to keep a wound from bleeding. The song is an appeal to God to be the 'Tourniquet' and stop the flowing blood. I'll admit this song is very addicting and the pounding music draws you in, but it is also haunting and the subject matter may be disturbing.<br /><br />7. Imaginary: This song is hard to describe, it seems to be talking about escaping to an imaginary place where you are free, with such things as 'paper flowers', 'candy clouds' and a 'purple sky' granted I may be missing a deeper meaning but that is all I got out of this song. It is a good song but can get old fast if you put it on repeat. :)<br />8. Taking Over Me: This seems to be another song about someone who lost someone they loved though a few of the words throw off this idea, it's more like the person the speaker sings about doesn't care or remember the speaker anymore. In general a good song and rather haunting as well.<br />9. Hello: The lyrics to this song leave me rather confused and maybe the deep meaning clearly trying to put itself across is obvious to everyone else, but the brief song has never been a favorite either in somewhat random lyrics or music.<br />10. My Last Breath: Clearly here (at least to me) the speaker singing is dying and singing a last song to her/his love. Though the idea of suicide is again implicated it is possible she/he is simply dying. It's a sad song to be certain but a good one in many ways.<br />11. Whisper: This song seems to be two people though one person sings it, in the verses it is a plea for help and the chorus is more like response to the plea. It is a very powerful song and the music runs in an effortless flow that carries through to the end.<br />The music: Though the rock/techno and sometimes choir approach won't appeal to many, it works well for me. It's easy to be motivated with music throbbing in your ears thoughthere are some blissful ballads to break it up as well.<br />The singing: Lead singer Amy Lee was a complete surprise for me, judging by what I heard of their music choice and the cover art I was not expecting such a high lilting almost Celtic voice. Her singing is part of what makes this album what it is.<br />Altogether: It is quite an experience and I don't think I will tire of this album for a long time and it is not a waste of your money in the least, but if anything above is not 'your thing' you may reconsider. I hope this gave you a faithful overview at least.<br />A word to other Christian Listeners:<br />These artists (I don't believe) are Christian, they have said so themselves and I would have to agree. However they do have points and sometimes whole songs when there lyrics are obviously Christian. In general they deal with deep issues (not the usual array of drugs, inappropriate love, flirting etc) and though some of that comes through in a very dramatic way like in Tourniquet it seems to reflect some true thought given to their lyrics. I find songs like Everybody's Fool interesting especially because the artist write their own lyrics.<br />In the end their songs can be considered clean without language or inappropriate implications but whether you want to buy this album and listen to it repeatedly is a matter you may want to closely consider.<br />Evanescence, Fallen: Rates 4 stars out of 5<br />~@~Rose

0679441018|5.0|Memnoch is the name given to the Devil by Anne Rice in this refreshingly modern theological story, based loosely off her widely popular Vampire Chronicles. The story is narrated by the Vampire LeStat, whose usual immeasurable fearlessness is shattered when he is stalked by a mysterious, immortal being who identifies himself as Memnoch the Devil.<br />Perhaps using the novel's plot as a vehicle to convey her own ideas on religion, Anne Rice describes, with delightfully sensuous imagery, Memnoch and LeStat's journey through Heaven, Hell, and time, while telling her Devil's story of creation. Memnoch, cast out of heaven by a God ignorant and uncaring of his Creation, attempts to draw the immortal LeStat to his side in his fight against the arrogant Creator.<br />While being told the origin of the universe, LeStat is also concerned about the inspiring mortal televangelist, Dora, who he has become fascinated with. LeStat is forced to decide whether to take the side of God or the Devil, and at the same time must protect Dora from the enemies of her criminal father (LeStat's victim) who has left her with a vast inheritance.<br />In this mesmerizing exploration of modern theology, Anne Rice transcends above the usual clash between atheism and Christianity, creating her own intriguing religious conflict, while keeping the vampiric hero LeStat's adventures exciting.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book to a conservative, biblical literist. But if you enjoy contemporary, controversial ideas, and enjoyed The Vampire Chronicles, this book is fabulous.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Certainly this is a very effective film and the restoration was good, only a mite overdone. It needed a hell more extras but it wassn't horrible or anything.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I've never bought a Britney Spears album before, but I really like this one.  It's a great dance CD; the beats are fantastic.  I think Britney's definitely grown up and I give her credit.  I wouldn't call her a serious musician with a beautiful voice, but she's not trying to be.  She's an entertainer and she's really good at what she does.  More power to her.

Charlotte, barely out of her teens, is in her underwear most of the time she spends in the Tokyo hotel room where she waits for her photographer husband to notice her.<br />You soon see that Charlotte's equally young husband is an idiot (insipid conversation about rock musicians, gullibility when a Sarah Michelle Gellar clone tells how her father fought on the &quot;American side at the Bay of Pigs&quot; and came back an anorexic).  While philosophy grad Charlotte is brighter than her husband, she shares one thing with him - -  she's no more emotionally mature than he is.<br />In one scene Charlotte and her husband  (writing this, I can't remember his name) are in their hotel room.  He's sitting on the floor, surrounded by cameras and expensive photo equipment (his toys) while Charlotte wiggles past him in her underwear, throwing a scarf she's been knitting around her neck, playing dress-up.  &quot;Do you think this is done?&quot; she asks him.  He doesn't know.<br />Lost in Translation is the story of Charlotte waiting to grow up, and finding someone to wait with her.<br />Bob is an American movie star doing an ad campaign for Suntory whiskey in Tokyo.  His marriage is rocky, but he doesn't want it to end.  Bob and Charlotte meet.  They each recognize a soul mate.  But they also know from the beginning that it can't last.  Neither one wants to take advantage of the other.<br />The comedy in the film comes from Bob's interaction with Japanese culture (sometimes verging on clich&eacute;).  The drama comes from Charlotte and Bob's desire for each other, along with the knowledge that, regardless of what happens in their marriages, they're not the ones for each other.<br />Bill Murray as Bob deserves the Oscar for showing all this with his weary face.  Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte displays not just grown-up emotions, but the act of growing up as we watch.<br />Tokyo, filmed mostly at night, seems like most big cities to be itself more than part of the country it belongs to.  We see the contrast when Charlotte comes across a traditional Japanese wedding outside the city, though you wonder if there's a reality for the Japanese somewhere between hypermodern Tokyo and re-creations of ancient religious ceremonies.<br />Charlotte and Bob spend their nights together, fighting insomnia, running from one club or party to another.  The Japanese they talk to are mostly young, struggling to be understood in basic English and even French, in contrast with businessmen Bob overhears in the hotel sauna comfortably speaking German between themselves, but not experiencing anything of Tokyo.  (I think they were complaining there was no German food.)  The music is American and British.  Karaoke is everywhere - - even the American lounge singer in the hotel is more of a karaoke singer than a New York chanteuse.<br />When they have to leave each other, Bob goes home to his family, while Charlotte walks into the Tokyo crowds, alone but confident.

B000089RVX|5.0|I must admit that Fallen was an impulse buy for me.  But as most impulse buys end up being a waste, this was quite the exception.  I bought this album back in May and I'm still getting heavy use out of it.<br />This album is such a breath of fresh air, and Amy Lee and Ben Moody make an awesome collaboration.  It's hard to place Evanescence in a specific genre, but I think another reviewer classified them best when he used the new term, &quot;Melodic Rock.&quot;  The lyrics are very memorable and full of meaning, the vocal range of Amy Lee is almost siren-like, and Ben Moody's guitar riffs make some purely intoxicating, fresh music that I cannot grow tired of.<br />There is hardly a &quot;bad track&quot; on the album, as each track can definitely hold its own.  Some standouts for me are Going Under, My Last Breath, and My Immortal.  The album has some range, which is probably why I still have not found it monotonous.  It goes from heavily layered guitar, drum, and vocal rock to simple voice and piano ballads on the same album.  It's laced with a touch of darkness in lyrics and vocal stylings which only enriches the album's content more.<br />Fallen is definitely my personal favorite this year, and I'll be rooting for it during the Grammy's to pick up Album of the Year.
0140186409|5.0|You know it's an American classic, and everything that has been written about it being a great book that depicts an era in American history in a phenomenal way is true.  I will just point out two things that I think the person who reads this book should know (especially if the reader is anything like me):<br />1.  The book starts out sort of slow.  I read the beginning and wondered what I had gotten myself into.  In fact, it started out so slow that I would have put it down had it not been required reading.  I urge you to keep reading!  The book is a classic for a reason, and it is good.  Eventually, it turns into a real page-turner, and you want to find out what happens next to the Joad family.  Later, you will want to check out what other people have said about this book.  I never would have gotten all of the Biblical allusions or other symbolism without reading and discussing this book with others.<br />2.  The ending will surprise you.  It shocked me.  I definitely won't spoil it, but the ending of this book left me, quite literally, jaw wide open.  WHAT? I thought.  Oh my gosh!  I was glad I had someone to talk about it with, because even in today's world, I'm sure most people would find it shocking.  And it is nothing like the movie.<br />That's my two cents.  This book is a great addition to your literary knowledge, and if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it, from both the literary angle and the historical perspective.
0452282152|4.0|Most of the interest in this book focuses on Vermeer, that mysterious painter about whom we know so little. But he is by far not the principal subject of this book.<br />The book (as all who have seen the film know), is about the trials and frustrations of an uneducated but exceptionally gifted 16-year-old girl who was born into a time and station of life for which she was not suited.<br />Her intelligence is portrayed at first by her observations about people's behavior and how she can control it (Vermeer's daughters, his mother-in-law and her maid), and only later by her sensitivity to artistic color and composition.<br />Her frustration seems to me the main theme of the book. Although I am by no means an expert, I have read a fair amount about life in northern Europe in the 17th century, and Tracy Chevalier captures this exceptionally well. The closedness of the society in which the servant girl who winds up having to wear a pearl earring lives is excruciatingly portrayed, and her ambivalence about her role is almost too painful to read.<br />The ending is exactly appropriate (it was not conveyed well in the film).

B00007KWHP|5.0|fragile is the album many yes fans point to as a starting place for the new fan. while the yes album is probably a better first listen, i tend to agree. roundabout kicks off this set of songs, and it is truly one of the greatest songs ever because of it's perfection. roundabout is a song that never gets old and it stunned me when i first heard it. the other gems of this record are obviously the other group efforts such as the brilliantly dynamic heart of the sunrise, the short but nice long distance runaround, and the stunningly beautiful south side of the sky. the solo works are actually pretty entertaining. chris squire's bass composition &quot;the fish&quot; is great, steve howe's classical &quot;mood for a day&quot; is impressive, and jon anderson's &quot;we have heaven&quot; is quite interesting. wakeman and bruford's contributions aren't quite as interesting but the latter's serves as a good intro to long distance runaround. the truth is, nobody could do what these guys did, and they are one of the most uniquely brilliant bands ever.

B00011V8CW|1.0|I bought this cd when it first came out and I love it.  I have always thought that it deserves much greater recognition in the Bowie oeuvre.  I highly recommend it.  So why the low rating?<br />I stopped in the local music store the other day and saw racks of reissued albums repackaged with outtakes, remixes, interviews, etc., and carrying hefty price tags.  This Bowie package is a prime example.  The casual listener is not likely to shell out the extra money, so these reissues are directed at the pocketbook of the more ardent fan who will have to cough up large chunks of change in order to hear the &quot;extras&quot;.  It is cynical, greedy and offensive marketing at its worst.
B00001SIES|5.0|Less avant-garde than their friends at Radiohead, Muse produce a fresh and moving style for 'rock music' in the post-OK Computer period.  With the music industry becoming ever more homogenous, a new and promising band to which discerning listeners can flock to is a step in the right direction.  Perhaps there is hope for artistic rather than commercial music in the new millenium.
B00013RC8O|4.0|After waiting for many years, I am pleased to say that this DVD release is quite a bit better than the laserdisc version.  The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is quite sharp and has good color. However, the sound is only fair, being clear but still monophonic.<br />The UK side of the disc is the more complete version of the movie, and has Charlotte Rampling credited and featured in a scene that was not on the laserdisc - a treat for those who have not seen it before.<br />The director's commentary adds another new perspective to the movie also.

I would strongly encourage anyone to get these headphones.  To top it all off, I received these very soon after making the purchase. Thanks!

0385504209|5.0|Of COURSE it's fiction, but the research behind the story is impeccable, and it makes the story very plausible. The author, Dan Brown, draws heavily on the book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln who spent more than a decade in researching the historical facts behind the story.  I did some research of my own. The organizations named indeed exist or existed as claimed: the Prieur du Sion dates back to 1099, and whose grand masters included such luminaries as Leonardo Da Vinci and Isaac Newton--not exactly lightweights--and apparently one of the more modern (1885) leading figures was a priest named Berenger Sauniere, abbe at Rennes-le-Chateau (also the surname name of the murdered curator in the story), and was followed by the Knights Templar, the Ordre du Sion's  military arm, (which was originally founded during the Crusades by Godfroi de Bouillon, who was named King of Jerusalem by the Pope, and was the leader of the first Crusade, AND who claimed to be a direct descendant of Jesus through Mary Magdalene; and the Opus Dei, which still exists at its headquarters at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York, exactly as stated by the author, and exactly as he described it.<br />The novel is obviously placed in the future, as the Pope is described as more liberal than the present pope, John II, and is his successor. The criticisms by present members of Opus Dei on their unofficial website qv:(Opus Dei: their unofficial homepage) quite apparently overlooked that fact in their criticism of The Ds Vinci Code. Actually, as the story unfolds, Opus Dei members involved fared quite well, and were certainly not maligned.<br />This book has caused a firestorm of criticism, primarily from the orthodix Christian community who are outraged by the claim that Yeshua (better known by his Greek name: Jesus) and Mary of Bethany (better known as Mary Magdalene) were married, had a child, and whose bloodline is still extant today.  This is a &quot;heresy&quot; that the  Catholic church tried to stamp out by murdering 15,000 residents of Provence, on the Mediterranean coat of France; a crusade which the Vatican launched in 1209 and lasted a generation.  That was followed by the Inquisition, which tortured and killed thousands more for their &quot;heresy.&quot;  These are historical facts, disputed by no one.<br /><br />This is a crackerjack of a tale, and it is little wonder that it ranks third in sales on Amazon (out of their over two million titles).<br />To begin with, the curator of the Louvre, in Paris, is murdered and an American, Professor Langdon--an expert in religious symbology--becomes involved, as does the curator's granddaughter, who is a cryptographer. The two of them set out to solve, not only the crime, but the mystery of the Holy Grail. I prefer not to tell more of the plot.<br />There are many surprises and unexpected twists in the story, but underlying it all is a generous history lesson that tells much about the early history of the Christian faith, much of it relating to the Gnostic Gospels which were found in the Egyptian desert near Nag Hammadi in 1945; the Roman Emperor Constantine and his part in suppressing most of the eighty some Gospels in favor of the four which were &quot;blessed&quot; by his scholars at the Council of Nicaea, and where the idea of the divinity of Jesus, the immaculate conception and the resurrection were given coinage by his &quot;scholars&quot;.<br />The Da Vinci Code certainly has an agenda: to give the legend of Mary Magdalene a wide audience, which it does in spades--and obviously, judging by its wide readership, it has achieved its purpose handsomely and quite plausibly.<br />Those who most strongly ctiticize The Da Vinci Code obviously do not do so because of the writing, editing, or research. All of those functions are quite acceptable if not outstanding. So, their criticism is because the story undermines their own religious faith. An understandable reaction.<br/>But, this book is an education in itself. I have done a great deal of research myself in this area, and I can tell you that I admire Dan Brown's effort immensely. He has done well to bring, even if it is in fictional form, so much information<br />in such an assimilable form to so many people, most of whom will not have heard it before.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre,<br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />and other books/>But, this book is an education in itself.

B000002UJQ|5.0|After borrowing the album &quot;Amnesiac&quot; by a complete off chance from the library, and becoming drawn in by the weird and wondrous world of Radiohead, I decided to see what other sort of material the band had released. <br />From the moment I heard those opening strains of \\"OK Computer\\" I was hooked. It is a memorable, haunting and emotional album, based on an underlying theme of modern technology. Finally, something that is not about love! <BR>It's impossible to pick one single standout track. This album should not be listened to as a series of separate songs. Instead, it should be listened to as one 53-minute long journey. To fully experience &quot;OK Computer&quot;, turn the lights down, turn your headphones up and listen to the entire album without skipping anything. I'm speechless every time after I listen to this CD. It's not something that will keep you dancing for hours. Admittedly, it may not be your style at all. But if you're anything like me, it'll leave you floating for days. <br />Note that I'm not saying any of this to appear 'hip' or 'cool'. If I wanted to appear cool, I'd have to be reviewing the latest Idol or hip-hop CD. I don't think it's fair of all those reviewers who have decided to give this album a bad rating, just because they don't have the patience or ability to accept other styles of music, or simply because they are sick of hearing it. Just because one person doesn't like this style of music, doesn't mean that everyone has the same opinion. <BR>&quot;OK Computer&quot; must have hade it into the Rolling Stone Top 500 for a reason. (Coming at #162 for those who are wondering) <BR>Work it out for yourself.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is my favorite Incubus CD.  The mellow sounds of the band and the trippy riffs are the heat.
0385510438|4.0|Yes, this is another lawyer story...but Grisham expands the parameters this time, giving more focus on characters and their development.  A nice leap forward for the writer.  As a fan, I've waited for him to break out of his usual shell, and he has certainly done so with &quot;Last Juror.&quot;<br />On a more tenuous note, &quot;A reader from New Orleans&quot; should concern him/herself with more important things.  Nobody likes a whiny little narc.

We do not usually watch the extra features on DVDs but we just had to watch every second of the Firefly collection. (Ok, with the exception of Joss Whedon singing the theme song, I only watched a little of that).<br />Ok, yes we are sci-fi fanatics, but Firefly literally blew me away. I watched every episode on Fox and can't understand why in the world this series wasn't given more of a chance...but then the so-called &quot;Sci-Fi Channel&quot; got rid of Farscape didn't it???<br />I guess we have to hope that the movie rumors are true...
B00008AWOG|5.0|Few words can describe how amazing this Album is from Opeth. Not only is &quot;Still Life&quot; one of Opeth's best, but it may be my all time favorite. Next to Orchid and Morningrse of course. However, this CD is very varying from those two albums,and most of Opeth's others. The album starts out with the unbelievalbe tour de force &quot;The Moor&quot;. This song has an amazing song structure, and all the boys show their talents in this song. I especially love the acoustic passages immediately moving into the unbelievably heavy verse. I must say this song is probably one of Opeth's best songs ever written. The album is one you can listen to all the way through, as it is a bit shorter then the others. It never gets boring, nor runs too long. It seems to me, that Opeth really pulled it off when they released &quot;Still Life&quot;. If you like Opeth, then I suggest you definately buy this album. Please don't be afraid of Mikael's demonic vocals, because soon enough you will discover his other tresure.
B00000F2M4|5.0|Perhaps the most enjoyable music documentary I've ever watched.  Sting's perfectionistic ways and the rigidity of rock mix wonderfully with the loose, exploritory feel of Jazz.  Seeing &quot;Dream of the Blue Turtles (perhaps his greatest solo effort) deconstructed is a true music lesson for any person who aspires to be a musician/songwriter/performer.<br />My favorite scene involves Branford Marsalis pulling out a tabloid and playing off Sting's true name (Gordon Sumner) and comparing his rags to riches upbringing and life, as written in the tabloid, to that of George Jefferson.  Hearing Branford calling Sting, perhaps the most pretentious musician out there, &quot;Little Gordie Jefferson&quot; as the band breaks into &quot;Well we're moovin' on up&quot; was a total riot.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I loved this movie! Some of the parts are really funny. What can I say? Disney never disappoints. It's a must-see with your mother or family and friends. Jamie Lee Curits rocks!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie stood in stark contrast to the other mainstream market movies in the theatres. Don't be fooled by the commercial; it's not a fun loving light hearted comedy. But it is something deeper. It's an unspoken want, with brilliant illustration of alienation and familiar feelings.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JM02|5.0|I heard so many good compliments on this movie. It was a buzz for a very long time. The bad thing about this is that my hopes get too high but all in all it was pretty funny and I enjoyed watching it. A great disney!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums by one of the greatest rock bands of all time!<BR>I agree with Der Kommissar (see review) in some respects, but he must be a virgin because he seems to have no idea that songs like \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" and \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" are NOT love songs.  One is about sex and the other is about a girl who wants a relationship and ends up with a one-night stand.  Also, \\"Ice Cream Man\\" is a slow song, but it is also a really good song if you realize that he's not really singing about ice cream.<BR>\\"Eruption\\", in my opinion, is one of the greatest guitar solos EVER.  You would almost buy the album just for this, BUT the whole record is superb.  If you have any interest in hard rock, check this out.  <BR>Also, to the Van Halen \\"newbies\\", anything before 1985 is with singer David Lee Roth.  Between 1985 and 1997 is Sammy Hagar (who sings VH's REAL love songs).  And finally, the singer on the album \\"3\\" is not worth mentioning because that album sucked.

0060523808|5.0|Most MBA programs utilize case studies to one degree or another.  As you work through them you develop mental habits of analysis that help you get to the nut of the case fairly quickly so you can get prepared for class.  One of the problems is that most cases are oriented as marketing cases, or operations cases, or strategy, or finance, or organizational behavior, or accounting, or whatever cases.  A few are used by multiple disciplines, but very few integrate all the management disciplines.<br />This book is a terrific integrated case.  I enjoyed it tremendously and feel I have learned a lot from it.  What I enjoyed most was the way Mr. Gerstner demonstrated the way all the disciplines are important in leading a great corporation.  And especially the difference between the emergency room behavior he had to engage in when he first joined the company and had to start the bleeding and the different emphases he had to have in transforming IBM into an organization that could thrive in today's marketplace while remaining a great corporation.<br />I am glad to read about his emphasis on corporate culture while retaining a fierce focus on operations and backing strategy with constant, continuous analysis with hard numbers.  All fueled with passion to win.  I think this is a winning recipe.  And it is very easy to write down, but almost impossible to really execute.  Mr. Gerstner did a great job and we all owe him thanks for keeping IBM together and making it competitive once more.<br />People who are angry that the old IBM is gone shouldn't blame Mr. Gerstner.  The old IBM was dying and was going to be broken up.  Finding the right markets for the organization to compete in and remain together was a bet not many would have made.  Certainly, it is not likely that Mr. Gerstner made perfect decisions nor did the people who worked for him act with transcendent brilliance either.  The point is not perfection; it is competing effectively, actively, and with some intelligence.  Mr. Gerstner shows us how he and his team did that in the 1990s and I thank him for this great book that I encourage all students of business to read closely.e.

B00000JLWW|5.0|Seriously, this is the best movie I've ever watched. It wasn't a box office hit for no reason. The technology is fabulous and it's just a great plot. It's not just lovey-dovey but it touches your heart because of the reality of thousands of lives that were lost. You'll want to watch it over and over again. If you haven't already watched Titanic then you cannot consider yourself a movie watcher! It's the BEST! Leonardo and Kate go so well together. The songs are great and the reality of it all is just incredible. It's not just a fictional movie or a chick flick, it's actually based on something real.

B00005JLXE|4.0|This well-cast movie packs a lot of story into one film.  I remember growing up that Daredevil was always different than other comics after all what other hero was sightless?  Also, the artwork of Gene Colon was much more like the artwork of the Dark Knight versions of Batman that come out in the mid-80's.  The movie had the same feel.  It was a heck of a lot better than the Val Kilmer/George Clooney Batman films but nowhere near the Spiderman movie.<br />As in the comic, Matt Murdock grew up in Hell's Kitchen in lower Manhattan.  His father was a fighter that went against a mob boss and decided not to throw a fight.  He winds up murdered as a result.  Matt is involved in a street accident where some radioactive waste gets in his eyes, removing his sight highly enhancing his other senses.<br />Matt graduates law school and becomes a Legal-aid lawyer for the people of the neighborhood with his pal Foggy Nelson.  The neighborhood crime is being controlled by a powerful mob boss nicknamed, The Kingpin.  Matt, using his enhanced abilities trains himself to become a masked vigilante named Daredevil who tries to thwart the Kingpin's activities (the Kingpin was behind Matt's father's murder).  <br />With his business seriously wounded, Kingpin employs a hired assassin called Bullseye.  Bullseye can make a weapon out of any object by throwing it with pinpoint accuracy at his intended victim.<br />Matt meanwhile meets a Greek heiress named Electra.  The two begin dating.  During a business squabble the Kingpin has Bullseye kill Electra's father, causing her to become a vigilante herself set on getting revenge.<br />There is one corny scene where Matt and Electra mix it up in a battle in a children's playground.  It looked like the director wanted to just throw in a scene from The Matrix.<br />I don't want to give too much more of the film away, but if you had followed the storyline in the comics you probably know how the film will turn out.  I know I highly enjoyed this film.  Colin Farrell is phenomenal as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner looks hot as Electra.  The actor who plays Kingpin has been in a lot of movies lately and he had to gain weight to play a convincing Kingpin, which he does well.  The movie will probably not appear to smaller children because of the blood and violence but anyone that liked The Matrix films should really like this one!  It is one of the films that is better to own than rent because you can watch it over and over.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie was not only incredibly well made, but was heartfelt as well.  Anyone with the least bit of knowledge of the effects of drugs on the human body can relate to this movie.  A movie not to be missed even by the blinkof an eye, the ending will leave you wanting more.
B00005JKC3|2.0|What could have been a great movie, slogs through the first hour at an excruciatingly slow pace.  Very weird directing where the screen splits into four different scenes, does more harm than good.  Bruce Banner, a child of parents that lived in a military base that tested nuclear devices like Los Alamos, grows up to be a scientist too.  When he is exposed to a dose of gamma radiation, the genetically mutated cells in his body go crazy and he is transformed into the Hulk using Shrek-like animation techniques.<br />The Hulk in this film looks and moves just like the Hulk in the comic book as opposed to the Lou Ferrigno (he makes a cameo as a guard at the beginning of the film) Hulk of the 80's.  He battles gamma-mutated dogs, the military and his gamma-mutated father (played in an incredibly boring fashion by Nick Nolte).<br />Some of the special effects of the film are great while others look real cheap (the Hulk has a battle in the desert with airplanes that look like they came off a carnival ride instead of like real fighter jets).<br />Sam Elliott is great as General Thunderbolt Ross.  The rest of the actors, especially the actor who plays Banner, need to go to acting school to learn how to put some emotion in their roles.<br />Don't spend your money on this one.  Wait to watch it on free tv!
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I was quite hesitant to buy yet ANOTHER re-release of this often overlooked classic, but the parties responsible for this magnificent transfer have truly outdone themselves.  This film has NEVER looked so pristine, so colorful- it was truly as if I was watching it for the first time.<br />Aside from the superfluous Disney trailers/ etc., the extras are quite thorough and informative.  A must for any Disney purist.<br />... So, where's \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Bambi\\"?
B00009MEA5|5.0|Great movie from the opening sequence to the very last shot!  Worth seeing again to see what you missed the first time.  This movie is the type where the director and editor did not put any \\"filler\\" into.  Every scene is important.<br />Keving Spacey is great and Kate Winslett convincingly drops her British accent in a tale of an anti-death penalty advocate who is awaiting execution for the murder of one of his fellow advocates.  Winslett's character (Bitsy) is a reporter who has the assignment of getting Gale's story before he dies and proving his innocence.  As the Gale's story unfolds one scene early on is very important.  That is where Gale is in a televised debate with the governer of Texas over the merits of the death penalty.  The debate turns into a shouting match with Gale cornering the governer into stating that if Gale could name one \\"innocent\\" person who received the death penalty, that he would sign an order to abolish the penalty in Texas.  As the movie winds towards a climatic ending we begin to realize that it is more important that Bitsy can prove Gale's innocence, than save him from leathal injunction.<br />The movie is full of plot-twists and incredible suspense with a few scenes that will startle you.
0385504209|3.0|The DaVinci Code has a 3.5 star rating overall, and that's probably accurate or somewhat high.  There are a LOT of misinterpretations and flaws in the book, but there is also much to enjoy.<br />This is a novel, a work of fiction.  However, Brown has done limited homework and portrays this novel as a vehicle for promoting alternate and plausible histories.  This is my biggest fault with the novel - that it pretends to be a peer-reviewed historical thesis.  Brown's personal feelings and biases are rampant throughout the work, which is fine for a fictional novel but has no business in a historical treatise.<br />And often Brown is simply wrong.  The number Phi, for example, appears to have magical properties until you learn it falls out in natural processes.  The ratio of male to female bees in a hive tends toward Phi due to the way male bees are formed.  The packing of seeds in a flower ratios to Phi because it is by far the most efficient arrangement and is a product of natural selection.  However, Brown offers Phi as proof of Devine Creation, via protagonist Harvard Professor Robert Langdon and a math student during his lecture.  To me this is irresponsible, like saying that the number Pi being buried within Egyptian pyramid architecture is proof of alien involvement.  Sloppy and wrong, and annoying things like this riddle the book.  Claiming the word \\"alphabet\\" comes from the first two letters of the Jewish language, \\"alef\\" and \\"beit\\" while completely ignoring the fact that the first two letters of Greek are \\"alpha\\" and \\"beta\\".<br />Brown also goes far overboard concerning symbolism and hidden meanings.  According to Brown, anything anywhere concerning the number 5 is a hidden allusion to the sacred female - the way Venus moves in the sky, the rose, iambic pentameter, my hand, the number of pennies in a nickel - ok, I made up the last two, but some of his inferences are absolutely wrong.  And these are just the instances I caught.  A true historian would probably shudder at the leaps Brown takes via the characters, who are all supposed to be the most learned experts in the field.<br />And for such smart people there is an appalling lack of logic.  From the first, where Sophie takes Langdon's transmitter and hides it in soap, then throws it onto a moving truck - I think I saw Cindy Brady do something similar in \\"A Brady Christmas\\", but this Harvard Professor remarks that she \\"is a hell of a lot smarter than he is.\\"  What a black mark on Harvard.  And like the Keystone Cops the Parisian policemen all chase the truck, leaving the two fugitives alone in the Louvre to saunter on their merry way, even though this is one of the most sensational murders of modern time.  No logic.<br />The codes are ridiculously easy.  There was good logic hiding the keystone in the vault, but a modern CNC machine would have easily cut off the top of the Cryptex without destroying the contents.  You could take it to a machine shop for 1000 bucks.  If I had the most important secret of 2000 years in my hands, I would have spent the grand and had the answer in 20 minutes instead of jumping through those ridiculous hoops.  There are far better ways to hide secrets then 14th ca technology, and I would imagine the Grand Leader of the Priory of Sion would know that.<br />Finally, the literary style itself is sophomoric.  The 1 page chapters are geared for an audience that cannot concentrate on one subject for more than 10 minutes.  There is no character development whatsoever, and the lack of logic and unbelievable circumstances allow for little character empathy.<br />So after all this, why did I give it 3 stars?  It is, simply, a very readable book.  A good book for late at night when you don't want to think too hard.  Plus, the concepts were fascinating to me (which unlike other reviewers I'd never been exposed to before).  I am not nearly as critical of  his prose as others - I liked his dialogue and methods for advancing his viewpoints.  Again, thereis no character development, but the characters themselves are secondary to the central thesis, like watching a Discovery Channel historical recreation rather than an HBO movie.  And while the character's lack of logic and Brown's incorrect assertions were definitely annoying, I found that they didn't really take away from my overall reading enjoyment.  However, I have amended my original rating to 3 stars.  The ending is definitely a product of an anxious publisher, and destroys the book.<br />So despite the many criticisms, I did enjoyed reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and though it only merits 3 stars.there is no character development, but the characters themselves are secondary to the central thesis, like watching a Discovery Channel historical recreation rather than an HBO movie.

B00004VVNB|2.0|The premise was good, the execution was grade A cheese.  The glitzy mall-like sets DO NOT age well.  The script and acting are perhaps intentionally puerile.  The miniaturization used for the aerial shots within the dome were bad even for the times, they looked liked toys.  The entire production has the look and feel of a typical Irwin Allen TV series.      Farah-Fawcett's character is nothing but a cameo role of a ditzy blonde Barbie.  Jenny Agutter is cute, however.  Michael York and Agutter look like they're having fun in what seems to be an unintentionally fun movie.  Peter Ustinov hams up his short scene to the point of being saccharine, but provides a pseudo-cuddly relief from the triteness of the entire production.    So why should you \\"run\\" to see this film?  Because I wanted to be as poorly funny in the title of this review as was most of this movie.  Seriously, however, there's an outside chance that Logan's Run might become one of your guilty pleasures, much like any theatrical-release movie that plays better on TV than in the theater.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|This sounds like Manowar and Queensryche got together on a Saturday afternoon, drank way too much, pushed the record button, and started jamming.  If that is your idea of a great album, then go ahead and buy it.  I'm getting rid of this junk ASAP.  Paschendale sounds like a ridiculous Tenacious D song - Bruce even sounds like Jack Black on it for christ's sake!  Journeyman?  Please - it is total crap.  The title track is ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS.  Compared to Bruce's solo recordings Accident of Birth, and The Chemical Wedding, this is a MAJOR step backward.  Those two albums are amazing - this one, is disgracing.<br />It makes me sad to have to write something like that, but this album is just so awful.  DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS THAT GIVE THIS 5 STARS.  IF YOU ARE A LONGTIME, HARDCORE MAIDEN FAN, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS.  NO WAY.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|\\"Dead Man Walking\\" is a great drama released in 1995 starring Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon.  It was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.  This true story was adapted into movie brilliantly.  The emotional impact is present in every scene and every word.  The hardcore impact is present from the moment Sister Helen meets Matthew, a death row inmate recently given his execution date, to the end.  Such intensity keeps audience interested the whole time.  This also opens the debate about death row in the US.  The ensembe was lead by Tim Robbins in his directorial debut.  He wonderfully created every scene with his own emotional impact, which is clearly expressed.  Susan Sarandon won an Oscar for Best Actress for her portrayal of Sister Helen (the real Sister Helen is seen in the candlelighting memorial).  Her research of the events and the people is prevelant.  This is one of her career bests.  Sean Penn's portrayal of Matthew earned his place as a serious actor; therefore, placing him many steps ahead from where he was before.  His heart and soul is poured into every scene, namely his breaking down scenes.  Both actors' own emotional impact makes this movie a more unforgettable experience.  Bruce Springsteen's theme song, also called \\"Dead Man Walking\\", is a great song and performance to represent such a powerful movie.  The movie \\"Dead Man Walking\\" is great for those looking for a powerdrama.  This will surely please audiences for many more years.
B000063DHL|5.0|Definitely different from all other Maiden albums, but you gotta love some of these tracks.  Sure, Deja Vu and Long distance runner are kind of stinkers, but the rest are good, and I have to give it 5 stars just for Alexander the Great - yes, the lyrics are basically a history narrative, but this song to me is one of their best of all their catalog.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Tell me why o why do ppl keep comparing britney spears to Christina A. Please stop it has become incredibly annoying reading that in review after review. It's funny I don't get it. There are plenty of artists that represent the type of singer/performer that Britney Spears is for exp. Janet Jackson, Madonna etc. These ppl don't have killer voices by any means and they definately don't sound like christina A. come to think of it there are very few ppl in the music industry that sing or sound like christina A to begin with. Britney is Unique. Anyways i truly feel all the hate and negativity comes from a lot of jealousy and envy. Since ppl feel she isnt as talented by whatever standards they become quite angry that she has such immense success and basically that they don't. To me music is all about self-expression and interpretation just like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I own both in the zone and Stripped and I love both albums to death for entirely different reasons. If Britney didn't have talent or whatever star power she embodies then she wouldn't be where she is. No body puts a gun to ppls heads and says go buy this CD ppl buy it cause they like it. Seriously if you don't have a way to express your opinion in a well mannered and intelligent way then do us all a favor and DON&quot;T POST!
B000003NA4|5.0|The first song I ever heard of Diana Krall was 'Peel me a grape' and boy did I fall in love.  I automatically bought the cd and fell in love.  She is one of the first jazz artists I was introduced to and remains to be my favorite.
B00005B36H|5.0|First of all, it seems to me that a lot of people don't understand the last song on the album, Faaip De Oiad. It is, perhaps, the most meaningful of all. It is a snippet from a late-night talk radio show called Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell. Mr. Bell has since gone to just doing the show on weekends, but it can be heard every night in just about every market. Anyway, I heard this call. It was several years ago when Art had a special line open for Area 51 employees to call in. The caller in this track, Steve, called in and made the frantic statement we hear in the song. The reason his call stopped, and why the song ends when it does, is because a major communications satellite inexplicably shut down in the middle of Steve's call. Much suspicion has abounded amongst those who heard the call that it was done on purpose by the government to keep the public from hearing Steve's message. We'll really never know, but the point is, Faaip De Oiad is NOT weird noise or a bad radio transmission, it is TOOL telling the public to think for themselves and not blindly accept what they are told.<br />On to the rest of my review. I have been listening to Lateralus for many months now, and have been listening to rock music all my life. It is my opinion that Lateralus is the finest album ever created in any era. This is not just an album, it is not just music. This is a piece of art that belongs in the Louvre right next to the Mona Lisa. The term 'art rock' is bandied about often when describing TOOL and it is accurate, but the magnitude of TOOL's artistry is underappreciated. TOOL are artists of the caliber of Da Vinci, of Picasso, of Michaelangelo, on a different medium, but the same spirit, the same passion, the same intent to touch people's innermost places. This they have done to exquisite perfection in Lateralus.
B000068FUM|4.0|This is the album they hit it as a collective band. With &quot;I'd Run Away&quot;, &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Nothing Left To Borrow&quot;, as my favorites, along with the classic &quot;Blue&quot;. After Mark Olsen left  the band the balance shifted as evident on their next couple of albums. But last year with &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; I feel Gary Louris has written another classic. His songwriting along with the comfortability of the band are their strengths. Pick up &quot;Tomorrow...&quot;, &quot;Hollywood...&quot; and then &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; and then you can go back and fill in the rest.
0553213105|5.0|A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the chagrin of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is wealthy. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married.  Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I recently reread this comedy of manners that I hadn't read since high school. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married. Even though we in the U. S. have lived through the 60's and the &quot;Women's Movement,&quot; sixty percent of law students now are women, and many things have changed about the way young women are brought up and what they do with their lives, I still saw a lot of families I know here. Everything changes; yet everything remains the same.<br />Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are quite wonderful in what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than &quot;venison&quot; or &quot;meat.&quot; While people often &quot;color&quot; when they blush, the only color named in the entire novel is blue; Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play. We do know that Elizabeth plays rather badly. I kept thinking that these young girls have too much free time on their hands. They need more hobbies or part-time jobs. Of course young women of a certain station in Austin's day didn't work.<br /> The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&quot; With that great opener, we are off and running.<br />Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own.these young girls have too much free time on their hands.

B000009RC2|5.0|I wasn't even born during the Mahavishnu phenomenom that began in 1971, but I sure feel envious toward those that were around then.  Those lucky souls were able to bear witness to the beginning of the jazz fusion movement.  Nowadays, &quot;fusion&quot; is associated with overflamboyant musicianship and soulless, unemotional arrangements.  Now the Mahavishnu Orchestra may have been flamboyant, but they were not without soul or emotion.  You see, in order to play with the gut-wrenching intensity of the Mahavishnu Orchestra, energy is needed.  And energy is derived from feeling.  So that puts that argument to rest.<br />Their first album The Inner Mounting Flame is a perfect example of five virtuoso musicians throwing themselves with reckless abandon into their music.  Guitarist and bandleader John Mclauglin's fretwork continues to sound jawdropping more than thirty years later.  His wild and uninhibited playing contrasted vividly with his clean cut appearance.  Keyboardist Jan Hammer and violinist Jerry Goodman provided a classy ambiance to bassist Rich Laird's and drummer Billy Cobham's funky and complex rhythms.  Also noteworthy is the band's cultural diversity:  Mclaughlin is an Englishman with a love for Eastern philosophy and religion, Goodman is an American trained in European classical music, Hammer is Czech, Laird is Irish, and Cobham was born in Panama but became a U.S. citizen via the U.S. Army.  How many albums have came out before or since with Indian, Celtic, jazz, classical, blues, rock, and country influences all wrapped together in one neat package?<br />As for the songs, you are better off hearing them than reading my musically illiterate descriptions.  The opener &quot;Meeting of the Spirits&quot; is beautiful, and majestic and infectious.  &quot;Dawn&quot; starts out slow and tranquil enough, but boy does it ever pick up.  There's the warp speed insanity of &quot;Awakening&quot; and &quot;The Noonward Race&quot;.  &quot;The Dance of Maya&quot; has a ominous psychedelic beginning until a blues breakdown erupts 2 and 1/2 minutes into the song.  &quot;You Know You Know&quot; is a ballad that at times threatens to explode into pandemonium.  How many ballads do you know of that have their own stinkin' drum solo?  The Celtic hued &quot;A Lotus on Irish Streams&quot; displays some subdued, but still very fine playing.<br />The Inner Mounting Flame shows what popular music was once capable of, and can be capable of again.  But sadly, popular music is overran with glory hogs who feel they have compensate for their lack of talent and justifiably declining sales by humiliating themselves with ludicrous publicity stunts (i.e. 5 day marriages, stripping at the Super Bowl).  So I say to you fellow music lover or to anyone reading this review, disconnect yourself from the talentless cavalcade of EmpTyV excrement and give real music a chance.ominous psychedelic beginning until a blues breakdown erupts 2 and 1/2 minutes into the song.  &quot;You Know You Know&quot; is a ballad that at times threatens to explode into pandemonium.

0739307312|5.0|The one thing I liked best about this book was the art and religion history.  It was a very well researched book and I couldn't put it down.  Definitely one of the best murder mystery books in a long time.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Oh god, this is the worst music I heard since... well since the last britney spears album. She sounds like a chimpmunk on helium and that whole I'm gonna whisper and sound cute thing ain't working. The Backrounds beats are horrible too. This isn't music. It's an example of what not to do if you really want to be labeled a singer.
B0000AMRJC|2.0|WARNING:  This is a RANT against this movie that reveals many major plot points.  Don't read on if you don't want to know.<br />First off, let me say that I LOVE gangster movies and Al Pacino.  This is one of the few gangster films that I don't like, and I seriously don't understand all the hype about Scarface.  I did think it was skillfully done, but this movie just made me mad!!  I hated Al Pacino's character.  He is probably the biggest jerk ever portrayed on film.  He abuses and uses everyone in his life including the woman he stole from another gangster, his sister, and his friends.  When his sister marries one of his oldest friends, he shoots the guy.  And his sister still stays loyal to him!!!  After 3 hours of this, I was so glad that Tony got killed in the end.  I only wished that everyone whose life he destroyed could have been there to pull the trigger on him.  <br />I realize that since I hated this movie and Al Pacino's character so intensely, that means that he really is a GREAT actor.  But great or not, I would never watch this movie again.  The two stars are given to recognize Pacino's talent in creating such a thoroughly despicible and revolting character.
B0000CAQ27|1.0|OMG I expected better material from PINK since her last album, but this just sux! She got all her anger out on the last album and this one I guess she is trying to make people dance but the words that she is saying is stupid and boring. I hope she comes up with better, angrier material next time.
B000008LL2|5.0|I first bought this CD when it was released back in 1992 and still listen to it religiously today(I've worn out 2 other copies). Thunder always rocked (amazing for a British band of that time). From the hammer of &quot;Fire to Ice&quot; to the melodic sounds of &quot;Like A Satellite&quot; Thunder's sound is distinctive. I would recommend any Thunder CD to anyone who love good ol' fashioned rock and roll.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I'm really not one for words but this movie has to be one of my favorites of all time.  The characters are so real and the story almost feels as if you were there with the two on their trip.  Everything feels so natural and immersive, highly recommended
6305313687|5.0|This is a very poerful and sad movie.  It's about a horrible skinhead who commits some murders and gets sent to prison where he realizes his wrongs.  When he gets released he sees his brother following in his same footsteps and trys to get him to not make the same mistakes he did.  It's a very powerful movie that examines (somehwat) racism and hate and how ridiculous it can be.<br />Be wary, due to the subject of this movie and xcontent is received an R rating.  There is an excessive amount of language inlcuding racist language (obviously) as well as brutal male prison rape seen, so be wary.<br />If you want something powerful and important, watch it.  Norton does an excellent job in his roles.  If you want something mindless, than go check out Daddy Day care.
B00000272N|4.0|This Alice in Chains' debut album only partially represents what the whole AIC thing was about. Just like many debut efforts, it mixes influences, styles and trends, and makes an impression of a band full of creativity but yet unsure of a direction they would be heading. So, we have AIC trademark sludgy riffing and slow tempos on tracks like &quot;Sunshine&quot; or &quot;Confusion&quot;, or most impressive &quot;Love, Hate, Love&quot;. But alngside them we also have more lively mid-tempo songs like &quot;We Die Young&quot;, or &quot;Put You Down&quot;. The intro to &quot;I Know Somethin' (About You)&quot; could very well be placed on any Red Hot Chili Peppers album. And the closer, &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, is an energetic hard-rocker.<br />Alice in Chains clearly find their inspiration in the legacy of such notable British acts as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, taking the bluesy touch from the first band, and downtuned guitar sludge from the second. Layne Staley's very diverse vocals are at their best on this record. Obviously, drugs haven't yet taken their toll on him. As usual, Jerry Cantrell's guitar is the cornerstone of the songwriting, and he also contributes with good backing vocals, creating multi-layered vocal patterns with Layne. The rhythm-section also suites the music and presents versatility in styling.<br />Though the songwriting at times is debatable here, and the difference in song-styles might turn off some listeners, still it's a very recommended album. Somehow it's emotionally uplifting to me.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|First off, I think my true rating would be like a 4.6 or a 4.7  Since Amazon does not let us get that into the rating system, I gave this album a 5 out of 5, since that is closer than a lower 4.<br />Now, I don't know what a lot of you were expecting.  I'm sure quite a few of you have their classics like Awake, Scenes from a Memory, and Images and Words, and Change of Seasons, maybe more or less most of you.  And a lot probably have the somewhat dissapointing Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and debut album (with different vocalist When Dreams and Day unite), but come on!  This album is good!<br />Yes, Dream Theater is a progressive rock/metal band and I know some of you are saying &quot;Uhh, what happened to the progressive?&quot;  Well...it's there...a little I guess, but not very much.  This is mostly a straight up metal album and if you were paying attention to their progressions *from* 6 degrees...it wouldn't be that shocking.  The songs here are heavy and hardcore (perhaps metallica should listen to this album to see what theirs could have been).  Theres good well written lyrics, heavy hardcore guitars and drums and a small amount of keyboards.  <br />It's all good here, If i want a hard and heavy album I'll pop this one in.  I mean, we can always pop in Scenes from a MEmory right?  So lets have more of a variety, and here it is!
B00005JMFR|3.0|A previous reviewer wisely divided fans of the first Matrix movie into two categories: 1) People who primarily were interested in the philosophical message and 2) People who were primarily into the action.  Of course, whichever category describes you will have a great impact on your opinion of the two sequels.<br />SHORT REVIEW<br />I've generally lost interest in action movies.  I must admit that The Matrix was groundbreaking and superior to any action movie I'd ever seen.  But what really captivated me about The Matrix was its philosophical message.<br />I find the philosophical message of the sequels to be muddled if not completely lost.  In The Matrix, there was a message of hope, and Neo (and Trinity and Morpheus) stood as the potential for every person.  But as Neo becomes Superman, he becomes inaccessible.  And along the way, the message of what is *real* and the message of what is *possible* gets lost.  And that's a shame since many of us were looking for that to grow instead.<br />LONG REVIEW<br />The Matrix and Rings trilogies are worthy of comparison because of their coincidence in time and in theme. Both deal with the human struggle to conquer and with the human struggle to understand free will and Fate. But Tolkien famously disliked analogy, and his books (and the movies made by Peter Jackson) stand alone as story. We relate to the LOTR characters, but we don't need for the story or the characters to have one-to-one correspondences to our reality. CLEARLY, THE LOTR TRILOGY SUCCEEDED BUT THE MATRIX TRILOGY HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTMENT. WHY?<br />The Wachowskis set out to create analogy. And we bought it with the first movie. We embraced Neo's struggle to understand what is real and what isn't, particularly the limitations and power of his own beliefs. We recognized wisdom in Morpeheus' mentoring of his crew. We embraced Trinity's passion for Neo and freedom. We spent a lot of time at the water cooler talking about what was real. WE BOUGHT INTO THE WACHOWSKI'S ATTEMPT TO TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT OURSELVES AND OUR WORLD--SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT THE POWER OF BELIEF. And we saw a little Neo and a litte Trinity in ourselves--we embraced that heroism in us and that desire to be free.<br />BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE SECOND MOVIE, THE WACHOWSKIS LOST ME: I COULD NO LONGER MAKE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE WORLD OF THE MATRIX AND MY OWN WORLD AND BELIEFS. I think there were 3 failures in Reloaded that had to be overcome for Revolutions to work:<br />1) The action was no longer connected to the characters' experience of overcoming the limitations of their own beliefs. Instead, action existed merely for titillation. But we had already been conditioned by the first movie to want not just great action but great action with *purpose*. Instead of meaning being communicated via the story, we were subjected to 'speechifying' by the main characters, particularly Morpheus.<br />2) Neo, in particular, became unrelatable, in part because he seemed unstoppable.<br />3) The challenge to Neo's beliefs--was he really the master of his fate?--left us befuddled regarding what had kindled our spirits in the first movie. The fact that this challenge to Neo (and us) was left unresolved only served to disinterest us.<br />UNFORTUNATELY, THE THIRD MOVIE COMPLETES THE MOVE INTO ESOTERIC TERRITORY. And for that reason it's difficult to watch. It has its good moments. But I had lost interest after the second, and this one doesn't win me back. Instead, it left me more confused. For more of what was 'reality' in the first movie, the dichotomous worlds of the Matrix and the scorched earth, is confused. Even the Oracle turns out to be merely a program. AND IT IS NEVER RESOLVED WHETHER NEO HIMSELF IS JUST A COG IN THE MATRIX OR IF HE REALLY IS A FREE PERSON. The Wachowskis had excluded me from their sheik little philosophy club in Reloaded, and they didn't invite me back in Revolutions.<br />Ultimately, the Wachowskis embrace of the esoteric --the fact that as the creators of their own little world they seem to not have been able to decide what was real in it and what wasn't--means that they failed to create a meaningful analogy with their Matrix world. Luke Skywalker goes through hope and despair, and we understand and relate to his world and his struggle. But Neo--Neo just got too far out there for us to relate to.creators of their own little world they seem to not have been able to decide what was real in it and what wasn't--means that they failed to create a meaningful analogy with their Matrix world.

B00000253N|5.0|If this album only had Track 9, I would still buy it.  &quot;Shelter From the Storm&quot; is the most beautiful song, the most beautiful  poem, and the most beautiful piece of artwork ever created by man.  Its presence on this earth provides strong evidence of God's existence.
0060512806|5.0|This is a very hard book to describe - it is a bit Catch-22 meets Enigma meets the current raft of cyper-punk novels. But unlike so many books that try to be many things and fails, this book pulls it off, and superbly.<br />A multi-threaded book that travels easily through time, it covers WWII, the pacific, cryptography, and modern developments in computing,managing to include engaging characters and a great plot. The ending does sag a little, but this may be because after 915 pages you are so wrapped up in the book you don't want it to ever end!<br />While much has been made of the author's cyber-punk credentials and the book's appeal to geeks, don't let this put you off if this is not your usual kind of thing (it definately isn't mine). Away from these comments, this book stands alone as being well written, very humourous, engaging to the point of un-put-downability, and you will probably learn something you didn't know before. Highly, highly recommended!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I just heard Jet's single &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl?&quot; on the radio and I just had to buy Get Born!!<BR> They have party songs ex:Rollover D.J.,Get Me Outta Here.Which are awesome!! But they also have deeper songs like Look What you've Done, and Timothy.Songs that are mellow and relaxing like Radio Song.<BR> Move On was nothing more than a dud!I hope their next record doesn't have another country turd tune like that!<BR>  Besides that it's awesome and is one of my favourite records of all time.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game has many layers of meaning behind the cover.  It is like an onion with its subsequent layers of meaning.  On the first layer there is a story about a young boy who is being trained to fight in the Third Invasion of the Bugger, the aliens.  His training is in the form of \\"games\\".  The adults in the novel think he is the one who will defeat the buggers.  Layer one of Ender's Game is the story and Ender's actions.  At this level everyone relates to Ender in one way or another.  The reader begins the game of decoding these layers when the first page is read.  Orson Scott Card said about this decoding game, \\"...If you don't care to play the game, that's fine with me.  I designed Ender's Game to be as clear and accessible as any story of mine could possibly be.  My goal was that the reader wouldn't have to be trained in literature...to receive the tale in its simplest form.\\"  That is what exactly what Orson Scott Card has done with Ender's Game.  At one junior high in Provo, Utah, a librarian reported that Ender's Game is the book that is lost the most.  This book is popular not only among young adults, but it is also extremely popular among adults as well.  It has a broad general young adult and adult interest.  As time progresses and more people read Ender's Game its popularity will soar.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|This movie is the most outstanding film in the world.  I loved everything about it.  The beginning was very good but when you get to the \\"War Scene\\" you will literily be at the edge of your seat.  You will be so happy walking out of a movie like this.  What makes this movie interesting is, unlike \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" this had a point to it.  People say that \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" was \\"all action, no thinking\\".  I liked the movie but that was actually what it was.<br />When I saw \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" it just blew me away.  It had everything a movie could ask for, Romance, Thrills, Action, Comedy, and even Horror.  Also another thing was that the movie had was the \\"flavor\\" that it was not even close to what the other Matrix films where like.  This had so much to do with all the life of zion and the thing that could happen and everything like that.<br />Mostly the thing that made me like this movie the best was becasue of the battle sequence it was about 15 to 20 minutes long.  I was so happy to see what would happen next in everything that they seemed to have.  This is one reason why I don't like to \\"Get up in the middle of the Movie\\", just like when i saw \\"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\".<br />Most of all I liked that this movie made sure that there will not be a sequal.  Even if there would be a sequal it wouldn't be any good.  It wouldn't have Neo, Trinity, or Agent Smith in there.  That would ruin the whole series if they made a Fourth Matrix Film.  Same with Lord of the Rings.<br />Why see The Matrix Reloaded when you can see The Matrix Revolutions?
B000002H33|3.0|Metallica at this point was not a bad band, although they sold out later and sucked. The first song &quot;Battery&quot; is very good, I like it a lot, it and the second song &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; are my favorites on the album. The rest is not bad, but it is certainly overrated. Also, this album's influence is overrated as well I believe. THe members of Metallica complain about Napster, yet their success came baecause they  STOLE music from Dave Mustaine, who started Megadeth, a better band you should check out. Get Killing is My Business... and Business is Good remastered, and Peace Sells but whos buying and anything else. Also check out testament, get their rerecorded best of First Strike still deadly and THe New order. Also, Iron Maiden is great and deserves a lot of credit, they get it fortunately unlike megadeth. Also if u like thrash metal and insane solos check out two great bands Children of Bodom and Kalmah.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is back on DVD, and LOADED with awesome extras! It's Disney's classic story of a little girl named Alice, who followed a white rabbit into a hole in the ground, and came out in a world of pure fantasy! All the flowers and animals sing and dance, and they're all quite mad! Alice meets one zany character after another, from a bumble-headed dodo bird and an insane Cheshire Cat, to the hookah smoking caterpillar and Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. She grows and shrinks and grows again, and eventually finds herself at the funniest tea party that ever took place! Alice soon has her fill of the madness of  Wonderland, but before she can make it home she'll have to face the Queen of Hearts. \\"Off with her head!\\"<br /><br />It's sad to hear the negative comments this film has endured since its release. Not everyone is a fan of stories that revolve around pure nonsense, but  even Walt himself never realized what a masterpiece he and his team had created when they transformed Lewis Carroll's story into their newest animated classic back in the early fifties. The film is lighthearted fun from beginning to end, full of brilliant colors and characters, all of whom are unforgettable, from the well known Cheshire Cat, to minor characters like Bill the Lizard. The animation is some of Disney's best, especially on the lead character, who really comes alive on film. The plot may be mere endurance and survival, but that's all you need in a movie that is such a feast for the eyes and ears, with more songs than any other Disney animated feature.  The lovely Kathryn Beaumont is outstanding as Alice (just as she was in the role of Wendy in Disney's Peter Pan). Sterling Holloway and Ed Wynn are brilliant as usual, and Jerry Colonna is hilarious as always in the role of the March Hare. But the real treat on this new, 2 disc edition is the special features menu. Disc one and disc two both have a nice selection. Of course, there's the expected stuff; Mickey Mouse in his classic short, \\"Thru the Mirror,\\" some sing-along-songs, a set top game, but they don't stop there! One of my favorite extra features was the program, \\"One Hour In Wonderland,\\" which I had been waiting years to see! This was a Christmastime television special sponsored by the Coca-Cola company, Walt's first TV program in fact, designed to promote the upcoming release of \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" It features Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Mortimer Snerd, Kathryn Beaumont in full Alice dress, Bobby Driscoll, a collection of teenage party guests, the Magic Mirror (played to perfection, as usual, by the wonderful Hans Conried), and of course, the young Walt Disney himself, accompanied by his teenage daughters. The setting is a Christmas party at the Disney Studios, where Kathryn Beaumont is the guest of honor. She and her friends are treated to a handful of clips, courtesy of the Magic Mirror, and a serving of refreshing Coca-Cola, courtesy of the Coca-Cola Company. Young Miss Beaumont is delightful, and the entire program is a wonderful piece of nostalgia I'm overjoyed to finally have in my personal collection.<br /><br />The wonderful extras continue though, with \\"Operation Wonderland.\\" This is a promotional featurette on the making of \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" We also get treated to some deleted material, which includes some terrific song demos for songs that didn't make it into the final cut, often for characters that didn't make it into the film. In the deleted material we get to see those characters some fans of the Alice stories missed in the film, such as the Jabberwock, the Lion, and the Mock Turtle. There's the usual, but much appreciated art gallery, a fine explanation of how one deleted song ended up making it into \\"Peter Pan\\" a short time later, a deleted story concept, trailers and TV introductions by Walt Disney, a new Cheshire Cat song, and even a card game set included in the DVD case. On top of all that are two more extras worth more detailed descriptions. One is the excerpt from \\"The Fred Warring Show,\\" a musical television show from the 50s that, in this particular episode, showcased the music of the soon to be released \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" Kathryn Beaumont, again in full Alice get-up, guest stars with Sterling Holloway in some live reenactments of several scenes from the film with the Fred Warring cast. The picture and sound quality on this program isn't the highest, but it's still one of the coolest extra features on the 2 disc set, if you`re into nostalgia that is. The last extra feature I'll mention is the Virtual Tea Party on Disc 1. It's mainly for kids of course, but I found it quite entertaining. There are a number of things to discover by selecting objects from the table, each object causing the party guests and hosts to play a new game or sing a new song. I suppose what I found interesting about it was the performances of the two cast members in the roles of the Mad Hatter and Alice. The Hatter was highly entertaining with his creepy Ed Wynn impersonation, and Alice, well, Alice was charming and quite a cutie. I only regret that I never found a cast list for this segment.

B0000027RL|5.0|When i first heard this album i was in shock.  Before listening to PJ i was strictly into rap and nothing else.  Ten opened the door to the rock and roll.  I have all PJ cds now and this is my favorite cd to date.  If you dont have it yet you should run out and get it right away.  My favorite cd of all time.  Worth the money.  I dont even listen to rap anymore
B00008H2LB|1.0|I admit have two of their cd's (both were given to me). What can I say besides the fact they waste really good production on stupid lyrics. I would have no problem with them if they wrote better songs to go with great music. Don't waste your money of this cd or on any cd they make, you'll go &quot;NUMB&quot; listening to this trash, becuase every song the come out with sounds exactly like the last, the same formula in every song. Chester sings then Mike raps as transition to chorus, and then Chester starts whining about how no one cares about him and life suck, &quot;BLAH! BLAH!, BLAH&quot; SCREAM. The same crap. Then go back at one. What can I say, it's like they're the Backstreet or N'Sync of rock or nu-crap. Whatever. Don't waste you time, buy a Cold or Incubus or a 30 Seconds to Mars cd, you won't be disapointed and bored to death them.
B00004S875|4.0|\\"52nd Street\\" was Billy Joel's first #1 album,thanks to the jaunty #3 hit \\"My Life\\" and two other big hits \\"Big Shot\\" and \\"Honesty\\".It also won the Grammy for 1979 Album Of The Year and became the first CD ever pressed in 1983.Musically speaking,it was a extension of \\"The Stranger\\",pushing into both jazzier(\\"Zanzibar\\",\\"Stilleto\\",\\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\")and rockier(\\"Big Shot\\",\\"Half A Mile Away\\")territories while remaining widely appealing and radio-friendly.Song for song,it may not match \\"The Stranger\\",but there are no weak songs either.Billy Joel had quickly established himself as the most talented and consistent hitmakers of the late 70's and early 80's,and \\"52nd Street\\" is a strong testament to that indeed.The 5.1 SACD mix isn't quite as good as the mix done on the \\"The Stranger\\".The sound is a bit flatter and duller than on that one,but I guess that was the result of the remnents of late-70's production values than of the sound quality of the SACD itself.That said,this transfer is superb for the most part,providing an excellent clarity,rich and spaciousness to such songs as \\"Honesty\\",\\"Until The Night\\",\\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\" and \\"Stilleto\\" that isn't available on the standard CD.All in all,this version of \\"52nd Street\\" is  surely recommened,just not as much as \\"The Stranger\\" 5.1 SACD.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Before everyone decides to critique the ever-popular Miss Spears herself, take the time to first go back in time and just play snippets of her `old' songs in your head.  Now that we are all up to speed, remember that she still has quite a few years into her time to improve her image, herself, her voice, her management...etc.  First things first, I am a Britney fan and I'm not ashamed.  When I say that, I'm not implying that I hate Christina Aguilera either.  A lot of people misconstrue the fact that if a person likes Britney, she hates Christina or vice versa.  Well, that isn't the case for me.  I believe that they both have something very unique to offer and that's what we should be focusing on.  Aside from that, let's focus on Miss Spears seeing it is her LP that I am reviewing.  I must admit that Britney has improved not only in her songwriting skills- which STILL need improvement, and her vocal skills- yeah she still needs help.  However, please listen to her voice.  If you listen carefully, she is so much LESS whiny and nasally and less annoying.  I'm not so pathetic that I don't realize she can't sing that well.  But hey, she is getting better.  This album isn't great, but I give it five stars because there is evidence that she actually tried.  How can one tell?  Well first off, look at the artists who took the time to help her produce songs.  She also took a very long time to come up with a new and breakthrough LP.  I give the girl props for trying and hopefully she will try and improve herself in every aspect, especially in her vocal area.  With better vocals and these great songs, she will be here for a LONG time, not forever per se, but LONG.
B00008EY9G|5.0|I agree with the reviewer from Egypt, except that I give the movie 5 stars and thought the &quot;last 20 moments&quot; made sense. Of course, it's only in hindsight that you can appreciate this or if you pay close attention to the interactions/conversations that occur throughout. I won't say anything more about that other than, if you're perceptive, it IS possible to figure out the ending ahead of time if you enjoy doing that kind of thing. The DVD cautions for strong violence &amp; language, but it's not a particularly &quot;gory&quot; movie, nothing more than you see any night on the major TV networks, though there are some unsettling images.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|THIS DVD IS WORTH YOUR MONEY.<br />This collection of episodes represents some of the finest work done in the science-fiction genre in years; the combination of sci-fi, western, and oriental influences meshes in a quirky way that WORKS.  The dialogue is smart; the acting is top-notch.  The stories are well written and well filmed; the effects are mind-blowing (and Emmy winning).<br />It's a shame that Fox TV made such a mistake with their handling of this series; they aired episodes out of order, didn't even show the pilot until the show had been cancelled, marketed it poorly, and gave it a lousy time-slot.  Fortunately, this DVD set remedies some of those problems; watching the episodes in order is a joy.  The pilot episode, &quot;Serenity,&quot; is better than most sci-fi movies that have made theaters.<br />Enjoy the pilot as a great movie, and then start with the regular episodes.  Give the series a little time to sink in.  You'll be hooked by the 2nd or 3rd episode.  It takes that long to really get into the universe enough to turn into a true fan.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|For fans of musical theater, this is a must see show and CD. The score has something for just about everyone.....ballads (I'm not that Girl, For Good), comedic numbers (What is this Feeling? Popular), love songs (As Long as You're Mine) and show stoppers (The Wizard and I, No Good Deed, and Defying Gravity). <br />Although based on the book &quot;Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West&quot; by Gregory Maguire, the musical has a very different tone and the storyline has been somewhat altered for the stage. The essence of the story remains however and Stephen Schwartz has come up with some wonderful new material to compliment it. The music is both upbeat and catchy as well as heartfelt and stirring. Stars Kristen Chenoweth and Idina Menzel are simply amazing. Both are vocal powerhouses (although Menzel gets the best of the material and handles it superbly). Chenoweth, as Glinda, fits perfectly in her role, sounding like the quintesstial Glinda. Menzel, as Elphaba, can belt out a song like few others can. On Defying Gravity, which closes the first act, she blows the audience away when she belts out those last notes while taking to the sky on her broom for the first time. <br />Unfortunately, the CD does not contain a story synopsis to go along with the music but I think it's probably because the powers that be did not want to reveal the various plot twists for those who haven't yet seen the show, thereby ruining the element of surprise. A good thing for those planning on seeing the show but bad for those who aren't lucky enough to get to the great white way for a live performance, as it does make following the storyline rather difficult. A minor complaint really because the CD gets better and better with each repeated listening.<br />I highly recommend seeing this material performed live by Chenoweth and Menzel as your appreciation for the music will only be enhanced. Check out the book also.
B000002KIE|1.0|The Pistols made Punk into the biggest media bonanza since hippie.When Punk came out, to spread out its dirty little wings, the generation caught by the narcotic f**k up of the sixties had a new hope something to fight for, to live, but within months the dream was sold, baught out it was turned into another commodity beacause of bands like The Pistols,The Damned, and the Clash. They can stuff their punk credentials, with all their money up their a**. ANARCHY IN THE UK WHAT A BUNCH OF BOLLOCKS, what did they ever do to live out that dream.They didnt care about punk, they dont wanna worry about anything. They numb their minds on T.V., space out on coke and dope they dont want their sh*tty lives to surface. I know its sh*t and u know its sh*t but they wont admit to the themselves that the fun they have all that style they got is the same old sh*t. Their music is a joke. Find some other Punk bands theirs many and a lot better too. THE PISTOLS, BOLLOCKS!!!

B000063COX|5.0|On my opinion, this album certainly is Maiden's all-time best. Each track is a masterpiece of its own, which proves that Di'Anno is a great vocalist. <br />Prowler - A great opener, which I consider as a classic, because of it's powerful solos and riffs. Di'Annos vocals are great. 10/10<BR>Sanctuary - Another one of my favourites. Many people don't seem to like this and I don't know what is wrong with 'em... 9.5/10<BR>Remember Tomorrow - Di'Anno really does his best here. Powerful riffs and the great vocals make this a very cool song. 10/10<BR>Running Free - Maiden's first single is quite simplistic, but effective. The guitars are great. 9/10<BR>Phantom of the Opera - The best song of the album. This 7-minute epic is one of Maiden's greatest masterpieces (on my opinion). The guitars are outstanding... 11/10<BR>Transylvania - Maiden's first instrumental is very good, but its only problem is that it ain't as good as &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; on &quot;Killers&quot;. 9.5/10<BR>Strange World - A song that proves, that early Maiden was not only a Metal. This ballad is certainly worth of a listen, since Di'Anno's vocals are breathtaking. 10/10<BR>Charlotte the Harlot - The first part of the Charlotte saga ain't that special, but somehow the song just rocks... Clive's drumming is on its own here. 9/10<BR>Iron Maiden - A pretty simple song, but it has the best chorus ever written. A very good song, especially, when played alive. 9.5/10<br />Now there is only one thing for you to do: Buy this album! Trust me...it REALLY is worth of it.

B00005JLXE|4.0|From a purely realistic perspective there's plenty of gripe about in Daredevil. It's often wildly improbable, but then it's not supposed to be a documentary even if it is more real than the one's Michael Moore makes. This is a fantasy movie. I grew up reading Daredevil in the 60's when Marvel was still young and Stan Lee, Ray Harryhausen, Irwin Allen, and Hammer Horror provided me with plenty of escapism even if all the elements weren't always logical. There's plenty of fantastic and totally improbable and impossible moments in Daredevil, but fantastic off the wall stuff in comics is nothing new. Superman fooled em all with a pair of glasses. Radiation does not turn you into a rock man, an invisible girl, a human torch, or make you stretch like a rubber band. I could go on all day. The computer effects in Daredevil aren't as good as they could have been, but at my age I used to be asked to believe that pie pans were flying saucers so I don't mind. Settle back with some quality popcorn and give Daredevil a try if you 'get' this type of movie. I'm very glad I purchased it for my DVD collection along with The Crow, The Rocketeer, The Shadow, and Spider-Man.

It will satisfy the most demanding reader.<br />I loaned out this book from a library with the intention of scanning a few good pictures to learn from.  I ended up marking up for scanning dozens of them that were too good to pass up.  So I decide to purchase my own copy of the book instead.<br />If you are artistically oriented, this book will give you hours and hours of enjoyment, and if you spend time to read the text, which is well researched, well written and prodigiously informative, you will as soon become an authority of sorts on J.

B0000636UN|5.0|Wow! after so many years of being silent. It's amazing what she has been working so hard to give us fans of hers good quality music to listen to. God Bless Her! I was so excited when I listened to this album. All you guys out there don't know how to appreciate music. Why don't you guys go and write your music and I'd like to listen to it if it's any good! Well this album is good and contains a few hits if they were released. Besides the hits Stever McQueen, Soak Up The Sun, You're An original, there are other good songs that should have been added to the hits list like Safe and Sound, C'mon C'mon(ALBUM TITLE), It's So Easy (Collaboration with Lenny Kravitz) and Missing. All these song are actually a mic of soul, rock, pop and a bit of jazz and hip hop if you are good listener. But I think you guys have heard enough from this review so I recommend anyone to buy this album. 'Cuase it's just so mother F*C*I*G good! I Tell you if you like rock, Pop, country rock, a bit of hip hop flavors. It's up to you in the end, I'm just a reviewer writing what I feel is good about this specific album. Bye and remember this, Live, Love, Learn and Dream everyone!
B00011RPB0|5.0|I would think that this sort of film would play better on a large screen in a darkened theatre, where the viewer is actually immersed in the images---the flicker of the neon, the passage of the overhead trains---and simultaneously senses that feeling of being lost in the largeness of a cityscape inhabited by so many bodies without any point of reference.  Although, the film takes advantage of the two leads' feelings of disassociation with regard to a seemingly foreign environment, the feeling evoked here by director Sofia Coppala is one all of us has sadly experienced one time or another.<br /><br />Indeed, it is this feeling that drives the small plot: a 50+ actor being paid millions to endorse a Scotch to the Japanese public ponders his aloneness and the meaninglessness of his existence during a whirl of publicity shots, advertizing takes and sojourns to the hotel bar.  At the same time, a 25 year old wife accompanies her photographer husband and stays at the same hotel where she contemplates being stuck in the irrevalent aftermath of someone else's existence. The two characters, both lost and unable to translate what they see around them into any meaningful frame of reference for themselves, turn towards each other, finding solace in their ability to see that they are at the same point of self-discovery within their own lives.<br /><br />Moody and dreary at times, despite the lack of action, the movie does convey that sense of being lost in a world that moves pretty much at light-speed momentum.  Tokyo may stand as the backdrop, but I think Coppola focuses on the world of hype and media in general-a world that conjurs up a pace of its own where human components are mere adjuncts rather than the driving force.  The two main characters question the relevance of such a world and revel in their discovery that together they find, at least for a moment, some translation relevant to their lives which actually causes emotion rather than simply sensation.<br /><br />I certainly do not recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a plot driven movie and who is not willing to sit out the long silences.  Rather than prose, this piece is a poem--a haiku, if you will.  Its message is simple, stark and bleak and the viewer must be willing to enter that sense of nothingness and accept it on its own terms.  Rather this film is recommended to those who want to ponder and think upon the small worlds we create to anchor us in a world pretty much out of control.do not recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a plot driven movie and who is not willing to sit out the long silences.

When they made it, the Coen's were still running out of the public eye - their quirky masterpieces, \\"Raising Arizona\\" and \\"Fargo\\" had not yet brought them fame. And because of that, \\"Miller's Crossing\\", a film about mob conflicts between the Irish gangs and the Italians in an unnamed Midwestern city (it is Chicago, isn't it???? Or is it?) did not reap its fame in theaters, but became a cult favorite on VHS. The release of the DVD in May of 2003 raised even more interest in the film.<br />In the Coen's world of gangsters, you don't just wait for the next killing, you've got to stay on your toes and figure out the next double-cross, and the next, and the next. Betrayal, revenge, and following orders - those are the central themes that result in loss of life in this period piece. The Coen's show early mastery of cinematography, score and sound. The camera angles, the transition between scenes, the focus on the details in the forest, and in every scene that takes place in Tom's apartment...they're all intricate and award-winning.<br />But, the film is ultimately character driven. The Coen's cast a couple of actors they weren't that familiar with (Gabriel Byrne as Tom Reagan and Albert Finney, so Irish he's green as Leo, the mob boss) and surrounded them with their usual cronies: Jon Polito as a rival of Leo's, Italian Johnny Caspar; John Turturro in fine form as Bernie Bernbaum; bit parts for Steve Buscemi, Michael Jeter, and J.E. Freedman as Caspar's henchman, \\"the Dane\\". They took a chance on unknown actress Marcia Gay Harden to play the sexy, conniving Verna; and it paid off, as she played brilliantly, foreshadowing her skills and the Oscar she received for \\"Pollock\\", and her nomination for \\"Mystic River\\" this year.<br />Synopsis of the plot:<br />Tom Reagan (Byrne) is the number one lieutenant of the Irish crime family, and the person the crimelord, Leo (Finney), trusts the most. He's steely-eyed, cynical, and accustomed to Leo tuning in to Tom's will. Throughout the film Tom seems to be getting in deeper and deeper in gambling losses, which he stubbornly refuses to let Leo pay. Less well known is the fact that he's carrying on with sultry Verna, who Leo's fallen in love with. Tom wants to throw Verna's brother, a double crosser named Bernie Bernbaum who \\"makes book\\" and likes boys more than girls...to the wolves, in the form of minor Italian underboss Johnny Caspar. Leo refuses.<br />The seeds of dissension are sown, and before the film ends, Tom has been everyone's whipping boy, based on his innate ability for the double cross. The final scenario leaves your head spinning, but in true Coen form, the central question - is there honor among thieves? - has been answered. And like the big, big movies of the 40's and 50's, the Coen's leave the best for the last; you will savor the last big scene.<br />I thought Gabriel Byrne was wonderful in the lead role.<br />At the time he shot this, he'd had bit parts in television and movies for over ten years. \\"Miller's Crossing\\", his first lead, proved his vehicle to move his career up, and helped him cross over into film producing. He has the memorable lines:<br />\\"If you want me to keep my mouth shut, it's gonna cost you some dough. I figure a thousand bucks is reasonable, so I want two.\\"<br />And to Verna, who's a Jewess:<br />\\"If I'd known we were gonna cast our feelings into words, I'd have memorized the Song of Solomon.\\"<br />Chemistry between Harden and Byrne is a bit puzzling, but it is definitely living and breathing onscreen.<br />There isn't a poor performance in \\"Miller's Crossing\\", but special mention should go to character actor John Turturro, who has the benefit of the role that would normally go to Steve Buscemi, (and Buscemi has little more than a walk on). True to form, Turturro and Buscemi can each play the mealy-mouthed, snide little characters that annoy everyone....really a mark of how brilliant each of them is! Laughingly, Turturro based his painful, whiny character on his observations of director Barry Sonnenfeld's demeanor on the set!<br />And in a truly Coen-like twist, Albert Finney also shows his versatility by appearing, as a gag, in drag, in the background of the ladies' room, a scene in which Tom confronts Verna about her brother.<br />There are just not enough accolades to give the quality of this film, and the transfer to DVD is inspiring, although special features are limited to discussions with director and actors. Since they're all such fascinating individuals, this may have proved wisest - it takes nothing away from the film.<br />Worth a spot in your DVD collection, \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is not \\"The Godfather\\" - but almost.everyone....really a mark of how brilliant each of them is!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's little I could say that hasn't already been said by the growing legion of fans of this network war-orphan, this crazy genre-hybrid of Sci-Fi, Western, hour-long action-drama and sit-com. It's got a little of everything, an appeal to everyone.<br />I gave it full marks, even tho it's not perfect. It is rather a diamond in the rough, whose polishing and cutting were ended prematurely. At its worst, it was still better written, acted, and produced than most anything else I've EVER seen on network TV.<br />At its best, it became (in only 11 aired episodes) a world and a family you'll want to revisit again and again.<br />Buy it. Watch it (in the right order). I doubt you'll regret it.<br />With a little luck, we'll get to revisit their world in the form of a motion picture.
0783226837|1.0|This movie is extremely pathetic and contains some of the worst acting I have ever witnessed in a movie.  I can't believe all these fools love this thing...it's about gigantic mutant worms coming out of the ground! Check out Tremors 3: Back to Perfection for the best movie ever!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I have to say that I loved this film when I first saw it in the movies, and I still do, but the DVD itself is terrible! Like other reviewers have already said, this disc has minimal features,and no booklet or even a chapter list inside the case. If that's not bad enough, one must then sit through preview after preview at the beginning of the disc before it even gets to the main menu. There is no way to skip ahead to the main menu.  This in itself is very annoying and intrusive! <BR>   My next complaint is that there is no running commentary by either Ms. Coppola or Bill Murray. Wouldn't it have been great to hear Ms. Coppola's thoughts on the film and what led her to this subject matter?  The case says, &quot;A Conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola&quot;, which led me to believe that it was going to be a commentary on the film.  Was I wrong! This &quot;conversation&quot; is nothing more than a little clip of the two discussing the film, while on location in Rome!! We don't even get to see them on location in Japan. I know that another feature is included called &quot;Lost on Location&quot;, which proves to be nothing more than a complete waste of time.  This short is just a jumble of jarring shots of the behind the scenes preparation for the film. It also makes Ms. Coppola look completely foolish and inexperienced as a director, which is really sad, because she did a brilliant job directing this film.<BR>    Overall, this is a wonderful film, but this DVD is lacking!<BR>See this film while you can in the theaters.  You'll enjoy it so much more!
0152023984|5.0|The paperback is a good size for traveling and you can easily finish the book during even a short flight. Even though it reads like a children's book, repeated reads are still interesting because of the ideas behind it.
B00007LTIB|5.0|RELAYER is probably the most complicated and most progressive Album wich Yes ever created, probably the most complicated and most progressive Album in the history of Music.<br />It is very difficult to compare this Record with Yes` alltime Classic Close to the Edge. <br />Opening the Album with GATES OF DELIRIUM, seems to be a follow up to THE ANCIENT from Tales from Topographic Oceans, but much more agressive and complicated.<BR>Different Countermelodies seem to be played independent from each other, very similar to an Igor Stravinsky - Composition, a componist wich is always named as one of the biggest influences of Yes beside the Beatles. This is the longest and most progressive (and agressive!) tune Yes ever created. Absolutely crazy!<br />SOUND CHASER (nomen est omen!) is very fast, similar to GATES OF DELIRIUM, but much more faster, like a storm, with a guitar solo in the middle-section wich shows Steve Howe at the peak of his incredible talent.<BR>Also incredible are the pumping Basslines by Chris Squire, the Jimi Hendrix of the bass-guitar, and the over the top Drum Playing by Alan White. This song is really a chase between different instrumental lines, one crazy melodie seem to chase the other.<br />The closing of the Album, TO BE OVER is the perfect contrast to the other progressive stuff, very relaxed and soft, with funny, country inspired licks on Howes electric guitar. <br />Better than CTTE?<BR>Its very close to it...

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Why are there so many dissapointed people out there concerning The Strokes' sophmore effort, &quot;Room on Fire&quot;? It simply baffles me that people can talk trash on The Strokes and then go back to their empty rooms and pop in some Nickelback! The Strokes have their own fan base and it's a strong one. &quot;Is this It&quot; and &quot;Room on Fire&quot; are not albums for the average listener of bands like Staind, Disturbed, Lifehouse, 3 Doors Down, and. . .I could go on regurgetating the madness that is terrible music but I won't. Instead, I want to say that I'm absolutly in love with &quot;Room on Fire&quot;. I personally believe that it's of equal brilliance to &quot;Is this It&quot; if not better than. Although at first I didn't have any feelings for &quot;Under Control&quot;, I've done an absolute 360. I adore it. The only song I disliked is &quot;The Way it Is&quot; but that's not to say I won't. Needless to say, with the exception of track #9, however many times it may take you to actually see that this album is truely wonderful, it's worth it. I can't wait until their next relase and I hope they stick to what they know because it's obviously working out. And for those certain people who think they owe grievences to other artists such as The Cars can shut it! There is not a single artist or band out there that doesn't play what they were influenced by. Now, if they had done a cover of &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;, then that would be an entirely different story but wait they didn't so stop your complaining and stick with your winey limp bisquick! So leave us sophistcats alone!
0385507755|5.0|At age 23, James Frey's life was broken into a million little pieces.  He had skipped bail in four states, he was an alcoholic, drug addict and had managed to alienate pretty much everyone who ever cared for him.  Yet, those who cared never fully gave up on him, because perhaps they could see the nugget of genius that gave us this powerful memoir.  While I cannot speak to those who have lived through the horrors that Frey recounts as he goes through detoxification and rehab--this book may have a different effect for them and I have seen some reviews here who just aren't buying what he has to day--to most who pick up this work--this will be an amazing read.  Frey's recount of his time in rehab is almost hypnotic, is addictive in itself.  The writing is different, almost disjointed, but it works.  At the beginning of the book, he recounts his experience getting root canal without pain killers--it is a powerful and evocative passage.  There are several other sections of this book that I don't think I will ever forget, simply because of the power of his writing.  I don't normally read memoirs--I picked this one up on a lark.  It's a quick read, not quick because it is &quot;easy&quot;, but quick because you will need to know how James got through rehab.
B00005YXZH|5.0|What is there to say about Yankee Hotel Foxtrot that hasn't already been said? Reprise called the album a career killer and immediately dropped Wilco from the label, they got picked up by Nonesuch, another division of AOL TW, so AOL TW basically paid twice for the same record. With such shrewd business practices is it any wonder that they lost 50 billion dollars? But I digress...<br />So anyway, this &quot;career&quot; killer got Wilco the biggest exposure of their career, a bevy of ****, *****, and 10/10 reviews, and their highest billboard chart opening ever at #13.<br />This is an extraordinary album, and this is coming from someone who didn't want to believe the hype. I thought that in the 21st century it was impossible to make a good pop record that means something, I was, oh so wrong. This album wound up speaking to me on a deeply personal level, &quot;Reservations&quot; still gives me chills listening to it, not just because of my personal connection to the lyrics but the wonderful ambience and feel of the song. &quot;Kamera&quot; is one of the most clever pop songs that never hit mainstream radio. &quot;Jesus Etc...&quot;, the standout song on this album in my opinion is beautiful, a masterpiece, the melancholy violins and Jeff Tweedy's voice, wow.<br />You'd be absolutely nuts to be without this record, I'd rank Wilco up there with Radiohead and The Pixies after this and Summerteeth. Also check out their early stuff, &quot;Sunken Treasure&quot; from Being There is a classic, and A.M. is a fun record for us college kids, &quot;Passenger Side&quot; is like an anthem.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Get Born by Jet is the most refreshing album I have heard in years.  In a world of Britney Spears and Eminem, it is hard for a 20 year old like myself to find decent simple rock without reverting back to The Beatles, The Stones, or Queen.  Not that it's a bad thing, but it's nice to be able to pop in a new cd and hear neo-classic rock at it's best.  The guitar licks are reminiscent of the Stones, and the ballads have a hint of John Lennon. Perfect ablum for any classic rock fan. -muppetjasi
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool started like many heavy metal bands, with a lot of raw anger and energy. In time they evolved to a higher order of metal. They blended instrumental prowess(Danny) with heavy effects and distortion, opening new doors to metal. No longer did you just have to turn the volume up to 10 and headbang. Thsi CD is the single best ALBUM for metal enthusiasts everywhere
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|The Noose. Need I say more? The song builds and grows as it progresses, until it climaxs right as you do. I would choose this cd over mer de noms any day. Maynard rules. A Perfect Circle is even better live with James Iha leading the guitars.
B000002KIE|4.0|This is a generally a good album, God Save The Queen and Anarchy in the uk are some of the best 'classic punk' songs out there. My dad got me into punk and this was one of the first bands i ever heard. Having a long time in punk since i was just a wee child i feel that this a some fairly hardcore sketchy music. It feels rough but of the time. It is well worth listening to and is to great to cruise and skate about listening to. Well worth getting and will keep you entertain for a while.<br />Proberly the best thing is that all the songs have a fairly different feel.<br />Yeah i rekommend this album for you people out there.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie after all the great reviews in addition to the Academy Awards nominations.I was bored to tears.I shut it off after forty minutes.Totally overrated.The Japanese stereotypes are offensive.A waste of time.
B000001F6N|5.0|It seemed as though everyone was trying to outdo themselves back then. We knew the next Beatles, Stones, Kinks, Who, or Yardbirds record whould at least try,(and often succeed), to be different and better than their previous release. But who would have thought that Mayall could do that without Clapton? Enter Peter Green, after 37 years, still the greatest white electric blues lead guitarist -ever-, (apologies to Bloomfield, EC, and SRV fans).
B00008EYA5|5.0|SWAT is the best that I would suggest people see because it is a best police movie to see if you want to go in the police force and if you want to see what they go thought on the force fighting the battle against the gungs and when they take down the people they are look for and if they don't find you they will get you soon and you don't known when they are coming for you and they might come at night or day you just don't how they coming when they are coming so if you do drugs they will find you and take you down and if you run from them they will be waiting for you at the coner if the street but you just might get hit hard and you might not known what hit you so just don't run and they would not hit you if you just give up and just let them in your house with any trouble with them and they with not have problem with you too.Talk to me at jtp1988_2002@amazon.com
B00005K9QP|5.0|In the hills and valleys of Eric's career, this is one of three high points: 1/The songwriting, 'loose is tight' band interplay and heartfelt vocals of 'Layla' have yet to be equaled in the 34 years since. 2/Cream, while challenging categorization, could fairly be called the first 'fusion' band , with Eric's flowing leads never losing his blues base, and so, saving the music from the nervous ego-driven sound that the style fell pray to by the time it was formally named. 3/ Bluesbreakers' music is the least original as far as material, (intentionally), but Clapton's tone and phrasing,(in spite his 'tips of the hat' to Freddy King and Otis Rush), is  personal and original, with the same wonderful balencing act of thoughtfulness,(introvertion), and projection,(extrovertion), that only a handful of the greats,(Albert King a prime example), ever achieved. It could be argued the Clapton himself never quite again equaled the pure feeling in his solos here.
B0000TB050|5.0|I bought mine in Ottawa, Canada for $17.  For some reason the packaging seems to be worth $10+ go figure......<br />This is simply the best U2 DVD concert out there - better than the Boston one, which I bought that after seeing the same tour in Oakland, CA.<br />You won't be disappointed.<br />Kix
B00006879E|5.0|I bought this album blindly, only really having heard \\"This Love\\".  The entire album is excellent, from start to finsih every song is fantastic.  Adam Levine's voice is the sexiest thing since Bono. The beats are funked out and shamlessly sexed up.  It is both a CD you can dance to and veg out to, the lyrics are like poetry, sincere and beautiful.  I have not been impressed with a band in a long time.  If you like late '90's U2, Oasis, Blur, Pulp, or the Police you will love Maroon 5.  This album is smart, sexy, and addictive.
B00006879E|5.0|I think it one of the best POP/ROCK albums in a long time. The first two tracks are their hits to date. Some hints of Stevie Wonder in the leads voice on a couple tracks. A little NSYNC MEETS ROCK AND ROLL. Very refreshing but they did get stuck in a rut in their style just a little (i.e., a little repetitive).
6302816580|5.0|I love this movie.  i was at school when it came out and have seen it countless of times.  Cant seem to find it on sale anywhere, and would love to see it again with the family.  I'm just surprised its not out on DVD. A typical Sly stallone feel good movie, thats a must for all generations
B00013PHGS|5.0|whoever is complaining has obviously ordered a european copy. copy protection hasn't started in the U.S. and the version i received from amazon is not copy protected. musically, what can i say? it's a gem from start to finish, great arrangements, great performances, inventive rhythm tracks, a super-chill makeout album par excellence. bonus DVD is a great watch too. a nice extra. finally an album that doesn't draw you in with a nice single only to find that the rest of the album is lightweight filler. thank you air for making an album of real substance.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I understand this movie is about being alone.<BR>So alone is will be on my shelf never to be<BR>watched again.  A waste of $20.00.  Who gave<BR>this one a great rating?  I would rather watch a &quot;chick flick&quot;<BR>than watch this one again.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I usually just put this DVD in as background music to a party or when I have friends over...the music is sooo good, groovy and jams...I am listening to it right now!!! Definitely a must, especially for those who like to kick back and smoke!!!<br />Especially when you think about the concept of it...A band thinking one day &quot;lets go set up and jam in an ancient arena in Pompeii and play to no one, just for ourselves and lets get a good director to film it&quot;  unreal!!!<br />Get this one and the Led Zeppelin DVD!<br />Enjoy...
B00005221L|5.0|The predator is without a doubt the greatest movie ever. With great action, sci-fi horror and none other than the greatest actor ever ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER! This movie was amazing when i first saw it and to even make it better was the phrases in the movie like &quot;GET TO THE CHOPPER&quot;. My favorite scene will always be the classic part where Arnold fights back. He lights a log on fire and screams for the predator giving him a taste of his own medicine. Overall this is the greatest movie i have ever seen.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Resume:<BR>I have been listening to metal of all kinds faithfully for the past 16 years since I was hooked by Maiden and Metallica. I moved on to Slayer, Dream Theater, Overkill, King's X. Then on to Fear Factory, Paradise Lost, Iced Earth, Therion, Morbid Angel, At the Gates, In Flames, Cradle of Filth, Nevermore, Nightwish, Saviour Machine, Shadows Fall, etc., etc., etc. You get the picture. I played in a band, I have seen dozens of bands in concert, I own over 700 metal CDs, I hosted a metal radio show for 4 years, I have defended modern metal to my (classic rock, stoner rock, top 40, dance, etc.) friends. I am not trying to be holier than thou, MY POINT IS:<br />Review:<BR>&quot;Waking the fallen&quot; ranks up there with whatever your classics are. Period. I'm talking top 5 material. It is a &quot;genre-buster&quot; that is bound to unite fans like Guns n Roses did with AFD or Queensryche did with Mindcrime or Slayer did with Reign in Blood. I had a friend who couldn't stand Queensryche but when asked about Operation:Mindcrime, he said &quot;Awesome, one of the best records ever.&quot; This is the type of impact this album can have. As with those 3 examples, where Waking the Fallen ends up on your list depends on your tastes.  <br />The first track I heard was &quot;Unholy Confessions&quot; and I loved the Swedish melodic death opening, then was blown away when I heard the clean vocals. By the time the song was 1 minute old, I knew I had to have it. When the punk/pop chorus hit, I knew I was hearing something special. That song continued to weave in and out of genres seamlessly - almost getting better with every second. And when it was over, I had withdrawl. Funny thing is, it turns out to be one of the &quot;weakest&quot; songs on the album! Of course, there are no &quot;weak&quot; songs on it, that is the beauty of a classic - you are excitited to hear each and every track. Every song has at least 5 pallatable metallic influences lovingly executed as AvengedSevenfold makes a sound totally original. This is the way it happens. Was Lord of the Rings a TRUELY original story? No, Tolkien would be the first to admit it was an amalgamation of his influences. Think &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was REALLY original? No, M. Night gives all the glory to Hitchcock. ANYWAY, Waking the Fallen continues to Genesis Chapter 4...oops I mean Chapter 4. :-)  Majestic fusion of melodic metal with a rock hard background riff. How cool is the vocal on this track? It's at this point I admit this is too good for words so I just smile and listen. Then there is &quot;Remenissions&quot; and I just laughed. That is all I could do. It was so intensly good I could just laugh at the joy it was providing me. I was thinking &quot;All of sudden they are a black metal band?! Then Sepultura shows up?! And HOLY SHIZZLE what is that acoustic perfection for 20 wonderous seconds?! And KEEP AWAY FROM ME! HELL YEAH! I don't know who I am telling this to, but I agree!&quot; Then it's fast again...it's demonically slow again...it's a Slayer riff...it's a MAIDEN breakdown! Then more fantastic clear singing until the fake out ending where some death metal takes you out. WOW. There is no doubt that is one of the best songs ever written. <BR>This is already too long, so I won't go into detail about the other tracks, except to say everything good you've read about &quot;I won't see you tonight&quot; is true.  Is it too much to ask for another masterpiece for your next recordng Avenged Sevenfold???? Please say you can accomplish the near impossible and do it again...
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Thank you, Eric Clapton, for giving us the blessing of this beautiful and moving concert in honor of George. I grew up listening to the Beatles, and always had a particular affection for George and Ringo, the two 'stabilizing' members of the band. I always appreciated George's quiet consideration before speaking, and his thoughtfulness and the fundamental goodness of his heart. When George died, I was deeply saddened like many millions of others, and thought that no tribute or monument could ever do him justice.<br />I was wrong. The Concert for George, primarily organized by his long time friend Eric Clapton, provided just the catharsis that his friends and fans needed. The CD was hard for me to listen to the first time as I wanted to hear George singing. Eric said it best in an interview, though, when he explained that at first rehearsals were tough to get through, but the rehearsals and show provided a mechanism of grieving to all his personal friends. That explained it brilliantly: They had time to work through it, while the listener did not. (Who says rock stars can't be truly insightful?) The musicians obviously worked very hard to get this just right and they succeeded brilliantly: this CD beautifully captures their efforts.<br />There are two CDs in the set, one is the Indian music segment, which was a good commercial decision (although George liked Indian music, and I respect that, I would bet than most of the purchasers of this CD are less enthusiastic about it) and the other is the concert in the original order, minus some material to make it fit on the CD. Ringo was a standout with &quot;Photograph&quot;, which is still the best Ringo song, and a song that Ringo and George wrote together, and &quot;Honey Don't&quot;, an old Carl Perkins song that George loved. Eric Clapton was wonderful on everything he performed on; I particularly liked his pseudo-duet with Paul on &quot;Something&quot;, and with the whole ensemble on &quot;Wah Wah&quot;, which had breathtaking percussion, and, of course, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, a song veritably made for him.<br />Without question though, the greatest performance in the show was by Joe Brown, a major institution in early British rock, but today relatively unknown in the US. Joe's main set started with a hauntingly beautiful rendition of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, and then went to &quot;That's The Way It Goes&quot;, a song I have always loved, but never got the acclaim it deserved. Joe also closed the show with the dreamy &quot;I'll See You in My Dreams&quot;, and he sang it like he meant it. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the beautiful &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot; by the multitalented Billy Preston.<br />There were a couple of weaker performances present, though. None that were overtly bad, but they certainly were not up to the standards of the rest of the show. The primary offenders here were Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, who are normally great, but came across as lifeless and flat. I also found Jeff Lynne's voice to sound a bit tired, especially when he sang a verse of &quot;Wah Wah&quot; and to a lesser degree on &quot;The Inner Light.&quot; I (really) hate to say it, but I also found Paul's version of &quot;For You Blue&quot; a bit dull. I think it's interesting that Paul picked a song of George's from &quot;Let It Be&quot;, an album where tempers ran high and contentiousness prevailed; perhaps that has clouded my vision a bit on the subject.<br />For any fan of George's this is a must. I never thought that I could like this CD as much as I do since I knew I would miss hearing George on the songs. After a few listenings, though, I now feel happy when I hear it, and have found it to be a fitting tribute to a great man. While we will always miss you, George, I will always be grateful for this beautiful and befitting tribute.<br />I'll see you in my dreams.eathtaking percussion, and, of course, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, a song veritably made for him.<br />Without question though, the greatest performance in the show was by Joe Brown, a major institution in early British rock, but today relatively unknown in the US.

After a few listenings, though, I now feel happy when I hear it, and have found it to be a fitting tribute to a great man. While we will always miss you, George, I will always be grateful for this beautiful and befitting tribute. <br />I'll see you in my dreams.
B000001EGE|5.0|If you are looking to buy your first Elton John album, there are two ways to go about it: Play it safe and get his first Greatest Hits album, which has most of his classic singles from 1970-1974. Or be a little braver, and snag this, his most tuneful and enjoyable session workout, released in 1972. It's pop music ear candy that's good for the soul.<br /><br />\\"Honky Château\\" has a lot of fans, and no wonder. It contains two of Elton's most enduring hits, the playful \\"Honky Cat\\" and the affectively yearning \\"Rocket Man,\\" along with 8 other tracks that hardly sag by way of comparison. I revere this album because it represents Elton John at his poppy best, the way I came to love him on the radio when I was growing up in the 1970s. Other great songs like \\"Mellow,\\" \\"Hercules,\\" and \\"Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters\\" add to a rich blend of musical styles that make listening to the entire album a pleasant journey that never gets dull.<br /><br />Listen to the way the piano kicks in on \\"Honky Cat,\\" the opening track. Elton's keyboard passages bounce from one wall to another and back again in unpredictable but clever rhythmic patterns, while a banjo throws out odd notes to add to the mix. The aural dynamics continue with each of the songs that follow, never in a bombastic way, but a very accomplished and relaxed manner that testifies to Elton's zooming artistic growth.<br /><br />Bernie Taupin's lyrics are funny and work either with or against the grain of the melody in each song in a way that adds to their signature diversity. \\"I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself\\" is a song that grabs attention for the wrong reason. It's actually about a self-dramatizing teen angry his parents won't let him use the car. His idea for suicide is laughable rather than horrific; he wants to hang around after he kills himself to see how everyone takes the bad news. If there's any lingering doubt about its seriousness, it's dispelled by the merry ragtime melody carrying it, complete with tap dancing. The song only works because the kid doesn't realize the gravity of what he's contemplating, because if he did he wouldn't be young and immature enough to think about doing it!<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album are some of Taupin's most famous lines, about \\"trying to drink whiskey from a bottle of wine,\\" \\"turn around and say good morning to the night,\\" and most memorably, \\"Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids/In fact it's cold as hell.\\" Man, did you think Taupin was writing that one about the street you were growing up on, too? Even when the lyrics are goofier, they still work, like his words to the nasty dreamwrecker \\"Amy\\": \\"You're far out, you're fab and insane/A woman of the world it's quite plain.\\" Elton delivers that one with the right gravelly intonation, all sleazy and '70s glam, which along with the dire yet funky piano accompaniment makes \\"Amy\\" my call for Honky Chât's sleeper track.<br /><br />The music is ultimately what makes the songs so good. Every song feels very unique, and none of it like filler. Filler is not a bad thing in and of itself; I define \\"filler\\" as being songs that either work or don't in the context of an album but not outside of it. But you can pull any one of these songs out on its own, and it won't wilt in isolation. \\"Slave\\" and \\"Salvation\\" may be my least favorite tracks, but both are solid tunes I can hum to myself days after last hearing them.<br /><br />My favorite on this album has to be \\"Honky Cat,\\" the sorta title track. I can listen to that forever. It really defines who Elton is on this album; carefree, amiable, willing to laugh at himself. I kind of picture him chained to a whorehouse piano playing that one, trying to make eye contact over his cokebottle glasses with all the wicked women because he wasn't out of the closet yet.<br /><br />Other Elton albums may lay greater claim to being art, but this was Elton's best pop record, and his most enjoyable moment on wax. \\"Honky Château\\" is a gem worth having for your record collection.cord collection.
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is a surprisingly deep novel where nihilism, existentialism, death, life, accepted values, personal values, irrationality of nature, and common tendency to search for purpose in life are all interlaced. Through Meursault [indifferent, not hedonistic or emotionless, but responsive to physical pleasures], Camus shows how intolerant society is to alien points of view, and how it tries to intergrate the unknown into its rational system of values. By showing that life is purposeless and everyone will die at some point, Camus suggests that the &quot;evilness&quot; or &quot;goodness&quot; of an action are all the same. The ultimate triumph is the realization : &quot;So close to death, Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over her.&quot;; in two words- Amor Fati. [Love of Fate]<br />Many will unhesitatingly place this novel in the top ten books in human writing history- it doesn't all have to be Shakespeare.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|i don't care if anyone thinks all the strokes's songs sound the same, they rule! the more i listen to this album the more i am obsessed with it. i listen to it more than any of my 300 c.d.s. some people criticize the simplicity of the strokes' music. the way i see it, if you like music listen to it. who cares about how complex it is. some of the best music is simple and awesome. this is one of the only modern mainstream albums that i think is worth the money.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation is one of the most beautiful films that you will ever see.  It's refreshingly understated and subtle in an era of in-your-face empty dramatics of most films.  The atmosphere is enlightening and the direction is tight, Sofia Coppola is very impressive.  Bill Murray is perfect, and is equally matched by Scarlett Johansson.  You will not regret this movie if you appreciate the art of film.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I'm a movie buff and Lost in Translation gets one lost to the point of being bored to tears. I'm not sure what all the hoop-ha is about, but there are a ton of great movies out that will leave you emotionally entrigued. Try &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; much better movie, great story telling, etc..
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica has recently become one of my favorite bands, if not my favorite. Recently, I completed my Metallica CD collection by buying Ride the Lighting and Kill 'Em All. I had already heard a few songs off of this CD, so I had an idea of what it was like. Even then, I was still very surprised with the awesome quality of this album.  Songs like &quot;Ride the Lighting, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Creeping Death&quot; are all awesome Metallica songs. I personally think the highlight of this album is the classic hit &quot;Fade to Black.&quot; It's an awesome emotional song that packs a punch. It's one of the best slow songs ever. If you're looking for something to add to your CD collection, you can't go wrong with this CD. It's one of Metallicas finest.
B0000CAQ27|2.0|I supposed it's Pink's self-imposed &quot;Tough Girl&quot; image that makes her critics overlook her great voice. And, as anyone who has seen her live (or on her recent appearance on Saturday Night Live) can attest to, Pink's act is for real, and works outside the studio, unlike too many of her contemporaries.<br />But the songs on this album are weak, to say the least. They are so dull, flat and lifeless that even Pink's powerhouse singing can't resurrect them. &quot;Trouble,&quot; the best song on the record, is a perfect example: energized and slamming for about 2 minutes, and then it goes into repeat mode and nothing happens...and keeps on not happening for another 2 minutes. Pink's backing band sounds like 50 million other suburban bar bands across the planet, including a lead guitarist who sure knows how to play scales and seems to have bought a really wicked set of effects pedals...just like every other guitar player between the ages of 14 and 25.<br />It's unfortunate, to say the least, that Pink is wasting her obvious talent on this kind of boredom.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|in my opinion this is their best album by far. It has more of the nu-metal influence but still keeps all the dream theater attributes that make dream theater the best band ever! the instrumental on this cd is their best instrumental ever at nearly 11 minutes and petrucci is amazing on this album. Many people say that all he is doing is playing fast but it fits the album perfectly. This album builds on you so don't judge it by the first listen. BY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!
0385504209|2.0|I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this book. The premises and subject matter hit my sweet spot. I got sucked in for the first few chapters, then I started getting angry. Repetitive suspense about things I stopped caring about, and factoid paragraphs slammed into the middle of the story as if taken verbatim from a 3x5 note card. &quot;Okay, I need to throw this scholarship in........HERE!&quot; I'm really not that hard to please. But if I'm going to help an author get rich, for chrissake, I'd at least like him to take some care and try to weave a mildly intelligent tapastry with the story and the scholarship, as if he really, truly cared about real storytelling.<br />I will say, though, that if every history professor took up their subject with the same spirit as Mr. Brown, every child would be a historian.<br />But for stories, this just makes me want to run back and hunker down with my David James Duncan and John Kennedy Toole and Flannery O'Connor.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A beautiful film. The cinematography is breathtaking. Coppolla perfectly provides the feel of alienation that a westerner can experience in a eastern culture.<br />Murray gives a oscar worthy performance.
B00008PW2D|4.0|Ok folks, enough whining about the disc only being 8 episodes.  I do not see anyone remembering that Season 4 gave us 18 episodes. If you are a true fan, you will add this season to your collection, no matter what.  The episdoes are as good as ever and manage to make me both laugh and cry (especially the wonderful season finale).  I honestly can't think of another series that has managed to do that in a 30-minute format!  So, let's average the number of episodes from Seasons 4 and 5 and be happy to have 26 great half hours that we will all watch again and again, long after the show is over.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This slow moving and boring movie is made... to test the theory of E.N.C in the modern days. Just because some critics think this is the best thing since sliced bread does not make it so.<br />This movie should only be recommended to people who are bored and have too much time in their hands (much like the characters in this movie). It is just on par to watching paint dry. Why it got so many Golden globe awards and Oscar nominations is way beyond me. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and then of course, nothing really did. I do not hate this movie, it is just boring. It is like water.. tastless and plain.
0790729733|5.0|It would be real cozy if Oswald had just been a disturbed individual who didn't get enough love and attention as a child, as in the Peter Gabriel song Family Snapshot, but alas, that might be an over-simplification.<br />Whatever you think about the Conspiracy/No Conspiracy battle, anybody should be able to appreciate this stunning movie, as a movie, which features a performance by Kevin Costner that is basically as good as it gets.<br />I won't repeat the rightful praise heaped on the movie by other reviewers, except to say that every good thing you have heard about this masterpiece is true. <br />As for the Conspiracy itself, the movie contains a few elements that may have arguably been discredited but on the whole, it asks a lot of questions that have never been satisfactorily answered. After the shameful whitewash attempt by author Gerald Posner, 'Case Closed' (gotta love his arrogance) JFK is like a breath of fresh air.<br />Personally, I didn't like or trust Kennedy, so I don't have a political axe to grind by aligning myself with the Pro-Conspiracy side. It's just that there is enough questionable data to make any reasonable person doubt the official explanations. <br />Gerald Posner's utterly laughable 'explanation' of the second shot as being a reflex action, in which JFK's head suddenly jerked backwards, is all you need to hear to know that the level of intelligence of the anti-Conspiracy side is enough to give Homer Simpson a superiority complex. <br />Olly Stone has got so much right here that the actual fine detail is almost irrelevant. He has gone a long way towards proving that a complex Conspiracy did in fact exist, and that's without including some of the most extreme (though not ridiculous) theories.<br />Just enjoy JFK as a piece of Art, because thanks to Stone, Costner and a stunning cast, that is what it is.
B000003TAL|3.0|From 1983's cacophonous, evil Confusion Is Sex/Kill Yr. Idols to the recent free-jazzy and mature Murray Street, Sonic Youth has been dedicated to pushing the boundaries with their arty, neo-classical, Velvet Underground-inspired noise rock. Out of two decades of groundbreaking, average-to-excellent SY releases, Daydream Nation is the one often upheld by music critics and fans to be their best. A masterpiece, they say.<br /><br />However, the fuss over this album is kind of puzzling to me.<br /><br />Why is that? Well, half of it just doesn't go anywhere. Unlike the previous album Sister, which had just as many musical ideas but conveyed them effectively through shorter running times, there are places where Daydream Nation drones along too often for its own good. Many songs start out excellent (The Sprawl, Candle, Silver Rocket, Hey Joni) with lots of neat song structures, Thurston's laidback vocals, and fascinating guitar work which is then quickly squandered in favor of piles of feedback. While I don't object to the use of feedback, there are more creative uses for it. Witness the band's first album Confusion Is Sex/Kill Yr. Idols, which despite being really, really noisy and ugly manages to retain my interest. On Daydream Nation the sonic experiments tend only to bore (and Providence is just annoying). Kim Gordon's riot-grrl voice stands out as more of an irritant here than on other albums. And the lyrics are typical SY--alternately cool and arty or pretentious to the point of stupidity (fortunately more the former than the latter on this effort).<br /><br />Despite all this there are a few really great, essential songs--my favorites being opener Teen Age Riot, Total Trash (the way it disintegrates toward the end is just awesome), Rain King, Cross The Breeze, and most of Trilogy. Still, this doesn't match the equally innovative (and more concise) Sister, the accessible yet arty Dirty, the gorgeously experimental Murray Street, or the fury of Confusion Is Sex/Kill Yr. Idols. I reccommend getting all of those albums first to realize all the facets of SY's sound. Daydream Nation is a worthy purchase for the SY fan, but if you're just looking for one Sonic Youth album I'd recommend Dirty or Murray Street over this by a long shot.mend getting all of those albums first to realize all the facets of SY's sound.

0788760440|4.0|The fictional story behind Vermeer's famous painting revolves around sixteen-year old Griet, who becomes a maid in the artist's home to help her struggling family.  She is a quiet, intelligent girl, fully aware of her rather helpless situation:  She must do the hardest work from morning til night without sympathy or kindness in the cold house.  She does, however, greatly admire the elusive Vermeer, and to her shock and secret joy, he asks her one day to be his model for a painting.<br /><br />Since the uneducated Griet is the story's narrator, author Chevalier has written in a very simple, uncluttered style:  There are virtually no compound sentences, few adjectives, and even fewer words describing emotions.  This is because Griet's lot in life is to serve; it makes no difference how she feels about people, events, or tasks, so she doesn't dwell on them.<br /><br />Griet never refers to Vermeer by name; he is always \\"The Master,\\" or simply \\"Him.\\"  While a bit of an affectation on the part of the author, it reflects Griet's view of him as bigger than life; godlike.  She never puts into words her feelings for him and we learn little about Vermeer, except that he took scant notice of his homelife, which was rife with domestic conflict.  The book is a leisurely-paced picture of life in 17th century Delft.  The last chapter was the most intense and was a satisfying end to Griet's quiet story.

B00005JLR6|5.0|This is as close to perfect as a movie can get.  A realistic look into a family, complete with all the struggles and the moments that make the struggles worth the effort.  I saw it in a freezing theatre and the film broke twice- and even with those distractions I found the film mesmerizing.  <BR>Wow!<br />I live in a fairly large city that struggles to show small films.  Why do we have to be subjected to multiple screens of garbage that lasts only a week or two as word of mouth gets out? Come on theatre owners - give us a chance to prove we will spend our money on the good stuff.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Any movie goer or video renter, who watches romance dramas or romantic comedies knows that the formula of every mainstream romance is the same: lovers meet, fall in love, usually have great sex, argue, break up, and get back together--and a Natalie Cole song more than likely \\"This Will Be\\" plays during the end credits. And we all know in reality that love isn't usually like that and meeting people and connecting with people is always a little deeper and more complex. And Sofia Coppola knows this too. Although its sometimes fun to watch random movie stars thrown together, not based on on-screen chemistry but more on reaching broader demographics, go through the trials and tribulations of love and romance. It's also enlightening and even more fun to watch films where two people trapped in their own private miseries bond in a foreign country for a week long odysessy of late night chats at bars, karaoke parties, and strip joints. That's the beauty that Coppola brings in Lost in Translation, a dreamy escape into the unique bond between hotel loners: Bob, an unhappily married, aging movie star in a mid life crisis played with sweet charm by Bill Murray and Charlotte a young wife struggling to find her place in the world played gracefully by Scarlett Johannson. Their connection is so endearing niether of them can explain it and they never dwell on the mechanics of it and Coppola never throws in a cheap Lolita-esque plot twist. The story is really shaped around two lost souls finding comfort in the other's company.  <br />Lost In Translation is a love letter to the mysterious ways people find each other in their most needful times and how attraction isn't always centered around sexual desire but perhaps a sense of longing or wonder about the possibilities of \\"what if\\" and the intimacy of the unsaid. And isn't that \\"unsaid\\" yearning the most beautiful language the heart could ever speak?
B0000DD7LB|2.0|This is not serious music, so I won't take it as so.  Most of it sounds like the soundtrack to a soft porn flick, but that is to be expected from a girl who has to get by through selling sex, or a distorted sense of it.  This is because Britney just does not have an innate talent, at least not in the music genre.  She is selling an image and persona which is sadly, and ultimately, harmful to herself and girls everywhere.  Real girls do not resort to selling their bodies as mere objects for the entertainment of men.  Girls should look up to some women who are beautiful as people, and not sex objects.  And if you want real music by a real girl, go find early Liz Phair.
0451169514|5.0|this thing is an opus, man. Unlike a lot of wimps out there, I'm not afraid of a whole lot of pages. I feel jipped if it's under three hundred. At the same time, I hate when I get a meaty thousand page book and it's full of hot air, like those Robert Jordan books. This book filled my every requirement. Nice and long, and chock full of story. It wasn't even the horror that made me love it so damn much. It was the kids he created and the adults they turned into. I wish I could remember my childhood the way King obviously remembers his, but I still recognized the thoughts and games those kids played. And that last line killed me. About how in the early dawn he almost remembers his childhood and the kids he shared it with. I feel the same way. Sometimes when I'm half asleep I almost remember and then it slips away. That last line almost made me, a grown man (and then some), cry. Man, this was a good book.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I really can't say enough good things about Jet.  They are a fresh and exciting new band with a fantastic array of songs.  \\"Get Born\\" is a mix of catchy, up-tempo rock numbers and classic-sounding ballads.  Although they have been criticized for being too formulaic, I think they just have a classic sound and continue in the rock tradition started by great bands like The Rolling Stones and AC/DC.  \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" is my favorite song on the album; it's such a well-structured song, and it shows how musically talented each band member is.  If you love rock'n'roll, you must add this album to your collection!  Jet definitely has a bright future ahead, and I can't wait until their second album comes out!<BR>-Maximum_Sonority

B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is definatly one of the greatest Disney And Pixar movies I've seen so far.  The movie is great for younger kids as well as older people.  The actors voices fit the characters very well.  Ellen Degenerse is the voice of Dory the blue fish, she does a wounderful job.  She really brings the Dory th life.  The whole movie is really funny.  At times I think the movie could of been a little bit better like there could of been more about when Nemo after he got saved.  Or when the other fish excape from the fish tank.  Overall the movie was great.  I would recommend this movie to people of all ages.  The way that the movie comes together is really cool.  One of the best parts is when Marlin and Dory meet the squirt and the other turtles. Squirt is the baby turtle and he is cute and funny.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is a great movie, and focuses primarily on three civil war battles: the first is between Union General John Buford and Confederate General Heth; the second is the battle of little round top between Col. Josua L. Chamberlein and Confederate General Hood; and the third, and largest battle, is the one between Maj. General Winfield S. Hancock and General George Pickett.  Pickett's charge is one of my favorite scenes because it really shows the meaning of everything that has led up to this point and the full extent of what the Johnny Rebs(Confederates) tried to do.I think the acting is very good; even Martin Sheen did a decent job as General Lee (contrary to what some others might say). The battles are realistic, and I think the storyline is just as good.  Some of the speeches seem a bit overdone, but some officers probably said pretty profound things to rally their troops.Some parts of this movies are a little slow, but can quickly turn to exciting action.<BR>Again, a great movie for fans of the civil war.  Even people who don't particularly like history can't help but get drawn into this movie.
0385336942|5.0|Wow!!!  What a tremendous book!  I have read and re-read Cloud Atlas and have thoroughly enjoyed each and every page of this compelling novel.  Cloud Atlas is as intriguing and bold as its Alaskan setting and masterfully twists the rigors of the Army and Catholicism with Yupik mysticism and the Northern Lights.  Somewhere entwined therein lies the truth.  Dare to soar with Cloud Atlas.
B00007FOMP|1.0|Listening to \\"What's Going On\\" is like having a really sexy civics teacher in high school.  She can talk all day about police brutality and the civil rights movement; your mind's somewhere else.   <BR>The songs simply blend into each other, creating a sweet and high tapestry fantasy with cops and cars and unemployment and the city woven in.  You won't even realize what you're talking about til you're done talking about it, and you won't know the record's over til you're ready to hit it again.  What you really want to do is just put it in your CD player on repeat and let the last song blend back into the first one.  It's almost seamless; I wish Marvin would've taken that to its limit.  I played around with it on my computer, erasing seams: it wasn't hard and the results completed the record, one big question, one big what's going on without an answer or an attempt to analyze and repair like most social records do.   Call that a strength or a weakness, there's an answer in the attitude here.  If the album makes me think bedroom thoughts beginning to end, well hey, make love not war.  It's not a sobering look at social ills, but who wants to be too sober anyway?  Everyone else<BR>can offer sobering looks at social ills.  Marvin offers a look at social ills with the truth but not the edge.  It's a thing to say.  But what I come back to is a peculiar sort of moral justification -- hey man, they're songs about social ills.  They just happen to make me feel like laying you down by the fireside...  something wrong with that?

B00005JLSE|4.0|I saw this in the cinema originally and had high expectations because I had so loved Moulin Rouge (but in general dislike musicals). I had high hopes despite my doubts about Renee Zellweger and overall dislike for Richard Gere. I had high hopes overall, generated from the &quot;buzz&quot; surrounding the film. <br />But I sat in the cinema and nearly fell asleep halfway through. I don't know why. I later got my hands on the DVD and watched it again and appreciated it much more. I don't know what the difference was the second time around, but somehow the film worked more seamlessly and was highly stylized and entertaining to me upon second viewing. I found the performances more compelling, the music more catchy. Movieviewing in general is more a question of your frame of mind when you see a film. The first time I saw it I was annoyed, the cinema was full, and there was an annoying woman next to me who left her mobile on and kept ignoring it instead of just turning it off. And of course in Iceland there are intermissions in the middle of most films, so the continuity is interrupted. <br />I was especially impressed with the performances of Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly. While the rest of the cast was impressive and obviously did a great deal of preparation for their roles, I simply preferred the smaller, more understated roles. <br />There is not a lot I can add to what other reviewers have said except to say that if you found yourself in a similar position... not really getting into the movie the first time around, you might want to give it a second chance.
0060955775|5.0|I think that many people think that the people is insane just because they are in their own world, I know that many people suffer of sever head problems, but many of them are just different from us and we think that they have to be at the hospital, as is written in the book, how many times you wanted to do something different and you didn't just because of the people? How many times you did what you wanted to do no matter the people? The difference to do anything different and not going to the hospital is not hurting anybody, even yourself.<br />This is a very easy and fast book to read I recommend this book in a long flight.
B00005JKN9|3.0|I did not expect much from this film because I don't like the cast much, and the story is also not within the purview of my own interests. Usually I avoid things with stories that don't have much redeeming value to me personally, but in this case, I thought I might as well watch. The DVD fell into my hands, and I figured it could not hurt. I can say I was impressed with the film... grand scale, interesting... but overall, it seemed a bit much. This is why I just think it was average or a bit above average. The grand scale in essence was too over the top for my liking, but I did find myself entertained and engaged in the story enough to stick with it through the whole length. It was gory, bloody and dramatic, also not my favorites, but I think the film is worth seeing.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is an exceptional film illustrating the complete ineptitude of the Clinton administration and it's UN-led, politically correct &quot;action&quot; in Somalia.  The film shows the impossible circumstances American soldiers faced when expected to engage in military action with as little agression as possible.  For example, &quot;don't fire until you are fired upon.&quot;  - and don't you dare try to engage the enemy (who are in the process of killing innocent civilians right in front of you) without the UN's approval.<br />Blackhawk down also shows the weakness of certain military leaders who sent warriors to battle with inadequate resources, then refused to send in reinforcements and medical help because they feared losing more assets.  Soldiers were left to fend for themselves in a grueling 16-hour battle with the value of &quot;leave no one behind&quot; as the new mission priority.<br />The most poignant scene in the movie was General Garrison trying frantically to clean spilled blood from the operating room floor.  The more he wiped the spill, the larger the blood stain worsened and grew.  Like the failed mission, it was blood he couldn't wipe clean.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Lost in Translation is probably one of the worst movies ever produced.  It was badly concived and terribly executed.  There is nothing there but the lack of knowledge, multiple mistakes, and the non-existant talent.  Why do we lie to ourselves and to others?  Why is it nominated for anything?  I do not know anyone who liked it and I hated it.  It was so boring, wrong and predictable.  Cinemas are empty when they show this film but they still show it.  Well, maybe the answer is in the family.  This family controlls business and there are many in the family.  I wish Sophia all the best but this is not the way to enter business.  I think she should try to use talent instead of connections.

B000002BYD|4.0|I can't believe how good this CD is.  I first got into Pear Jam with Ten and bought all thier reconds until Yield came out.  I hated No Code as well as this album.  It actually drove me away from the band.  A couple of months ago, I went through my PJ catalog, and couldn't believe how this album stood up the test of time.  Ten, Vs, etc can't even compete with this album.  Six years later, my music tastes matured.<br />If you want good music without all the teen angst, it's well worth it.
B000006TRV|5.0|This Cd is a masterpiece full of emotion and great music. Some of the best songs are:Mother, Hey You, Don't leave Me Now, and Comfortably Numb.. But those r just my personal favorites..But this cd is just a work of art. Anybody would b happy 2 have this in there collection
B0001906O0|5.0|When I heard that the cure was going to release their b-sides I was excited about the box set.CD one is probably the least favorite of mine. CDs three and four are probably the best of the 4 cds. Japanese Dream the radio edit is the not as good as the 12&quot;inch mix. It would have been nice if they would have included the remix instead of the edit. Hello I love you, the world in my eyes, purple haze were great covers with the cures psychedelic feel too them. Out of this world, maybe someday, just like heaven were all great remixes. One of my favorite songs is &quot;burn&quot; from the crow soundtrack. There are a lot of good songs on this box set. Overall, this is a great collection of songs from the cure which I know everyone will enjoy.
B00005JMCT|4.0|Until today, my life was missing one thing. One unique moment that truly set itself apart from all previous others. That moment? Watching Seann William Scott's character, Steve Stifler, eating a dog doo truffle in the latest \\"American Pie\\" installment : \\"American Wedding\\". Now you might think that a film with a heinous stunt like this in it's content, would be nothing short of repellant. But I assure you that between dry heaves, you're own body will be ravished by uncontrollable laughter. Stifler, who is undeniably the anchor of all three pictures, comes alive in this outing and solidifies a place as one one of the most unforgettable characters of the last decade and obviously the funniest. There are, however, a few instances in which Seann's portrayal of a tactless, out of control & oversexed jock feels a bit contrived, but overall he does a solid job providing 2,000 Lbs. of hilarity. Another character that completely stands out, is that of Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). The scenes in which he is trying to depict a bad boy facsimile of Stifler, are some of the most memorable. Now you might notice the absence of some of the core cast members from the first two films; namely Chris Klien, Tara Reid and Mena Suvari. But \\"Wedding\\" seems to work well despite this. Among the returning cast are Scott, Thomas, Eugene Levy (Mr. Levinstein), Thomas Ian Nicholas (Kevin), Jason Biggs (Jim) and Alyson Hannigan (Michelle). Yet, the presence of the engaged couple (Biggs & Hannigan) is virtually non-exsistent, especially since the entire movie is constructed around their wedding and the events leading up to it. In fact in most of the funniest scenes, i.e. the dog poo truffle, the bachelor party, the cadent gay club dance sequence, Biggs is practically nowhere to be found. But Scott and Thomas take up the reins and somehow it all comes together, as once again the film makers have created a disgustingly depraved shock-fest that also manages to come across as innocent and sweet (We actually see Stifler pining over the cute, virginal but horny Cadence, played by January Jones). Quite an acheivement in the over-saturated market of teen to twenty-something sex comedies, most of which are completely devoid of any true heart. \\"American Wedding\\" is the culmination of an outstanding trilogy of must see comedies from which fans of the first two films will no doubt procure particular enjoyment.ctually see Stifler pining over the cute, virginal but horny Cadence, played by January Jones).

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Perhaps the key to liking this movie is to be patient. By the end of the movie, I was convinced that Sofia Coppola deserves every accolade she gets. It is her patience in letting this story tell itself through well-paced action and stingy dialogue that lends such a deep palette of emotional color to the movie. As a writer, she shows a discipline of concision that T.S. Eliot could only get from his friend and part-time editor Ezra Pound. As a director, she allows the camera to dwell long enough on every situation to extract a high degree of clarity, and manages the actors' looks and positions to beautifully complement and emphasize their great ability to show emotional depth. I was truly impressed with her abilities as both a screenwriter and director.<br /> Coppola's exploration of viewing as a trope is a powerful element of the film. She beautifully juxtaposes her highly visible characters with their feelings of inconsequence. She accomplishes this through her slowly revealing narrative and rich cinematography. As affluent white visitors, they are easily seen in Tokyo. In Bob Harris's case, not only does his fame attract attention, but so do cinematographic elements like his wardrobe (the clips on the back of his tuxedo jacket) and the composition of his height in shots like the elevator scenes. For Charlotte, it is her beauty, marriage to a globe-trotting photographer and familiarity with New York and L.A. lifestyles that marks her. The camera's attention to her half-clothed body from the title scene to near the end establishes that these characters' visibility is an intimate one for the audience. The pervading close-ups of both characters reinforce a high degree of audience voyeurism. <br /> It is with this understanding of viewing as a powerful trope in the movie that the title becomes so meaningful. Translation is, of course, a form of viewing the unfamiliar. And whether the translation is being done by one person or through an intermediary, the existence of the untranslatable is always a moment for introspection. The incomprehensibility of a statement or emotion (or any sign) calls into question the mental and emotional faculties of the person who is attempting to translate. Bob Harris is intensely interested in accurate translation, as his scene shooting the whiskey commercial attests, but so often, as with his relationship with his wife, he tires of translation's inherent difficulties and comedically capitulates. His coping mechanism shuts off introspection. Charlotte, on the other hand, is just coming to grips with translation as a mode fraught with difficulty. She copes by trying again and again, whether by visiting monasteries in attempt to \\"feel\\" something or by trying to find a profession. Her coping mechanism invites introspection. By combining these two characters, at two very divergent points in their lives, with opposite ages and genders, sharing a common daily alienation of translation and introspection, Coppola creates a dynamic narrative that reveals itself in silences and incremental emotional clues that the characters give one another through looks and touches. It is clear what gets translated effectively: their emotional connection and affection for one another. Certainly the mode of showing affection to one another is more difficult for them to translate, and the ebb and flow of restrained sexual energy is positively mastered by Murray and Johannsen. But Coppola reveals that what is truly lost in translation are the closest relationships we all share with our loved ones. The most over-translated relationship is that with the spouse, where meaning is truly glossed over. <br />Coppola gives us two distinct modes of spousal mistranslations. Bob's is a subtle one, where 25 years' worth of translated meaning resides in the spoken and unspoken relationship-weighing on Bob so heavily that only mundane discussions can be tolerated. These subtle mistranslations act like smooth rocks-they do not cause noticeableturbulence alone, but if considered as a whole, can divert a river of meaning between husband and wife. Charlotte's lost translation with her husband is still new, a product of projecting desires onto one's spouse, which they both do. And while their spouses are both strikingly absent, their alone time, their time of introspection, is spent translating who their spouses are and why they are with them. Interestingly, Charlotte's experience of the Tokyo world (which is concentrated in her sexual energy) is as subtle and inscrutable as the cause of the mistranslations in Bob's marriage, while Bob's experience of the Tokyo world contains glaring mistranslations that mirror Charlotte's marriage. It is therefore no surprise that they are attracted to one another. Even Bob's infidelity with the laughable lounge singer doesn't destroy a relationship based more on unconscious soulful affiliation than surface attraction.<br />Let's hope Lost in Translation doesn't get lost in the hype. Is it groundbreaking? I think so, but not in the way one might expect. From Greek tragedy to today, we have touchstones of human emotion like hubris, anger, jealousy and humor. This movie has somehow evaded the predictable reduction of many movies to these emotional touchstones. This is not \\"older man meets younger woman and they escape moral turpitude by not consummating their affection.\\" It is an emotional landscape of shared introspection that could only happen so clearly on the screen because of their isolation, visibility and, paradoxically, their opposite situations in life. Their own moral codes interact with the foreign and liberal atmosphere of Tokyo as a party town in a way that resists easy reduction into good/bad, folly/wisdom. They both learn from the other's revelation of thoughts about himself or herself. The audience is given the ability to experience the space of shared introspection and the doubts and triumphs that it entails. Thank you to Sofia Coppola for bringing us a moviethat does something different and meaningful.
B000001FGG|5.0|While flawed in places, this still ranks as a 5 star album.  The studio work is odd at times but never boring or predictable.  Even the traditional blues songs have little quirks that take them out of the normal 5-bar variety.  Then there's the live part.  There has never been a 3 piece band who could improvise/jam together like these guys.  For the average listener these songs may sound like one long drone (and Baker's long drum solo and Bruce's harmonica rant may well qualify) but the interplay on &quot;Spoonful&quot; and &quot;Crossroads&quot; is amazing.  This is where Clapton ascended to the throne of Guitar God.  His live lead breaks on &quot;Crossroads&quot; are the best in rock and roll history.  It's not the vocals, bass or drums that keep that song playing perpetually on classic rock stations the world over.  It's that incredible flowing guitar.
B000089CKH|4.0|If you like New Order, The Black Watch, Olivia Tremor Control or Spoon, you will like this a lot.  Nada are hands down the best band on Barsuk (Death Cab for Cutie are limited by too much cuteness--as their name might suggest--and a patent similarity among the songs).  It's hard to compare LET GO to anything really and truly right now--which is good.  They used to be borderline unlistenable (read:  too commercial and slick), but now they are just artistic and polished--a big difference.  Few bands turn things around like this.  4 stars cause the lyrics are sort of...banal.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|The debut Album for this Melbourne rock band matches the hype and much of the talk that surrounds it.  Song's destined to become bar singalongs or show anthems such as Rollover Dj and Are You Gonna Be My Girl give an understanding of the band's influences as they are blatantly evident in the songwriting.  These rock and roll obsessed boys who listened to abbey road throughout the grunge period and confess to being suckers for melody express this feeling in the ballads Look What you've done, Move on, Come around again and Timothy while leaving much room on the album for the thrashing riffs of other songs such as Get What You Need and Take it or leave it.  All of the songs on this album blend together for an excellent debut which credits the ability of all involved as well as the love of music expressed by the band so often.  The only question of this album and band is what will it lead to, what is next for Jet.
B00005JMF6|5.0|The suspenseful and heart-stopping Gothika is not for those with a weak stomach or with chronic heart problems.  Mix in a little Halle Berry finesse with some asylum nuts and a ghost on fire and you have a great date movie.  Gothika will make you jump, maybe scream, but it will surely have you cheering for Berry during her trials and tribulations. A thrilling ride through the world of crazies in a nut house; Gothika is scary enough to quench the thirst of those horror film fanatics and also give you a little intelect for your buck. This movie is worth watching until you go blind. I highly recomend it.
B000002LRX|5.0|this is truly a great cd. I originally didn't know who Faith no More was, but I found the song &quot;A Small Victory&quot; and I got in to them quickly. &quot;A small victory&quot; also is my favorite song on the cd. My other favorites are &quot;Land of Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Mid-Life Crisis&quot;, &quot;Kindergarten&quot; and &quot;Jizlobber&quot;.
B00000DHRX|5.0|This is a great CD! Put in your car, relax, and feel the music take control! I would reocmmend this to everyone. Period. If you don't love GM now, you'll love him after getting this CD. Enjoy.
B000002O3I|4.0|this is great stuff as all of the reviewrs have noted, but if you want a truly remastered sound try starting with &quot;HIS BEST&quot; on the Chess label. much of the same songs, and WAAAAAY better sound. the songs he wrote himself on the first 1/2 of the CD are the best ones.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I was so excited about seeing this movie.It came to only a few theatres where I live. I had to beg someone to see it with me. I was lucky enough that I went to see it before all the nominations came out.However, I was not very impressed. I felt like the movie was going to pick up and it never did. Not enough of a story for me.
B00004CWO8|4.0|Matthew Bourne transformed this beloved antique of a ballet into a parable for our times. Set in the early 1960's (I think; judging from the costumes, anyway) it follows a little prince as he grows up surrounded by the paparrazzi and discovers his own sexuality in the form of a swan prince. Just the fact that Swan Lake was given an involving storyline is a vast improvement over previous versions, but the complex themes of the prince's homosexuality, his relationship with his mother, his failed relationship with a \\"bad\\" girl, and the constant presence of the media add multiple dimensions to what was once a loosely structure story. The costumes, the sets, and choreography are all amazing--the DVD gives a scene-by-scene synopsis of the new version, but it really isn't necessary because of the creative use of pantomime and focus on the dancers' expressions tells the story for itself. And although it does contains more false endings than the third Lord of the Rings movie, it is definitely worth watching. It is certainly not your grandmother's Swan Lake, but this is surely for the better.
B000001OAA|5.0|This is on my top 10 favorite albums of all time.  I love how the band combines the normal rock sounds with a techno edge.  Shirley Manson's has a great low voice, which works perfectly with the vibe of this album. Best songs:<BR>Queer- Offbeat and quirky, dare i say sexy?<BR>Only happy When It Rains- Extremely catchy, you won't be able to stop singing along.<BR>As Heaven Is Wide- Dark with low hissing vocals.<BR>Not My Idea- Angry, great lyrics \\"Yout thought I was a little girl, you thought i was a little mouse, now I'm here burning down your house.\\"<BR>Vow- Good intro.<BR>Stupid Girl- Slow and fun.<BR>Ok...  All the songs are great!
B00005JME0|5.0|so against the reviews and ratings i went to see the movie. now ashton was critcized because we all know him for his comedic side. and butterfly effect was far from funny, but i have to say ashton is amazing in this movie, it just goes to show that he has a serious side as well. the movie was pure talent, and i'd go see it again. good job ashton.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I'm a 13 year old kid, so needless to say I was too young to appreciate Nirvana back when they were still a band.  When \\"You Know You're Right\\" was released on the radio in 2002, a lot of their older songs began to get more airplay as well, I never knew who sang some of the songs and once I knew that it was Nirvana i ran out and got this cd.  I love every song on it, and since then I've purchased Nevermind and burned In Utero.  If you already own the other Nirvana albums, then there is not much point to buying this cd, but if you're a new fan (like i was) then this is the perfect way to begin to appreciate a truly amazing band.
B00007KQA3|5.0|\\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" (the actual on-screen title) is a rare example of a film adaptation of a book that faithfully transfers the visions and theme of the book's author, right down to even filming on the dates that the author specified (April-June 1984). George Orwell's frightening, hellish novel of a future where freedom has vanished, even from the minds of human beings, has been turned into an equally frightening film version. Its tale of a government that seeks to utterly crush the human spirit through propaganda, language, and fear, turning human beings into programmed machines, has never been more frightening than today. It is a book and movie for all times, as long as governments lie, tyrannies exist, and people surrender their freedoms in the name of fears, both real and imagined.<br />The casting couldn't be more perfect. John Hurt, looking worn and stretched past his years, is the ideal actor to play \\"little rebel\\" Winston Smith, who dares to think against the mysterious Big Brother and to fall in love. In his last film role, Richard Burton is like a glaring Greek Statue, stern and unflappable and scary. It's an unnerving and great performance. As for Suzanna Hamilton, Winston's love Julia, I was shocked when I first saw the movie: she matched exactly the image of Julia I had in my head when I read the book.<br />Director Michael Radford (who also directed \\"Il Postino\\") imagines the world of George Orwell exactly as the author would have if he had directed the film: as a wrecked vision of late-40s Britain if it had lost World War II. The set design is stunning, combing some high technology (video screens and computers) with rusty mid-forties technology (pneumatic tubes, rotary phones). Everywhere is decay and deprivation. Nothing really works, everything is bland and ugly in that awful, gray-stone block style that dominated Soviet and Chinese government architecture of the 1940s and 1950s. No doubt about it, the director understood where Orwell was comingfrom, and the models he was using.<br />Just like the book, \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" is a film that will utterly devastate you, get under your skin, and change the way you look at the world. It is a masterpiece.<br />(A note on the disc: Although they receive credit, the music by the Eurythmics has been completely removed, as per the wishes of the director. Since this is a no-frills DVD without much in the way of extras, there is no alternate music track to let people hear the original theatrical soundtrack. However, the film is much much better without the Eurythmics; they don't fit the style and feel of the film or the wonderful original music. Also, the washed-out photographic style of the original released has been changed to a more natural look; but this has been true of every version since the theatrical release. None of this should prevent you from getting hold of this wonderful movie.)
B0000CAXIC|4.0|The songs on this album that are good, we'll they're really good.  I can listen to tracks like: Monkey Wrench, Hey Johnny Park, My Hero, Everlong, and Walking After You; over and over again without getting sick of them.  This is probably why many of those songs became singles  However, this album does have some filler as well.  Songs like: My Poor Brain, really don't do very much for me.
0553062182|5.0|I picked this book up at the library yesterday by accident.  I was hoping that the book would help me understand my emotionally sensitive neighbor.  Well, after opening the book and reading only two pages, I realized that Dr. Aron was describing me.  Dr. Aron, in her book, is not describing emotionally sensitive people (although some of you may be as well) but rather she desribes those who have sensitive nervous systems.  I have always misinterperated my blushing, heart racing, and foggy mind to a mysterious fear, or neurosis, even though I didn't really feal afraid.  Now I know that being in an arousal state is not the same as being afraid or shy.  I read the book in three hours and have cried tears of joy ever since (and I am not a very emotional person!).  Throughout my life, I have felt so oddly out of place and only have one friend that I would say really knows me.  After reading this book I cry just knowing that it's not my fault, that I am not a weak person, that I am valuable just as I am.  After a lifetime of avoiding people, avoiding driving, and always needing time alone to &quot;think&quot; I am renewed and literally reborn!
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is in my top 5 favorite albums of 2003.  There's no filler, and every song is great.  I was first introduced to the white stripes when I saw the video for &quot;fell in love with a girl.&quot;  It was a good song but it wasn't until &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; came out that I really became a fan.  That being said this album has a very unique sound to anything else on the radio today.  Heres what I think of each song:<BR>1.Seven Nation Army- Great guitar and drum work in the beginning.<BR>2.Black Math- Fast paced and fun.<BR>3.There's no home for you here- Jack does some talking on this song, but it works out ok.<BR>4.I just don't know what to do with myself- this song goes from soft and quiet to hard and loud. <BR>5.In the cold, cold night- I love this song!  It's very slow-paced and with meg singing it's one of the best on the album.<BR>6.I want to the the boy to warm you mother's heart- sweet lyrics<BR>7.You've got her in your pocket- another slow song; I think Meg's voice works better with the slow ones but this song is still very good.<BR>8.Ball and Biscuit- Some nice guitar work<BR>9.The hardest button to button- Very catchy; not quite sure what it's about.<BR>10.Little Acorns- Fun to bob your head along with; good drums; the intro into it goes on for too long.<BR>11.Hypnotize- Also fun to bob your head along with.<BR>12.The air near my fingers- A good song; nothing about it really stands out.<BR>13.Girl, you have no faith in medicine- A bit screamy.<BR>14. Well It's true that we love one another- Has a country sound to it; I like how its a duet.
B00005JGAF|3.0|Why, oh, why? Simply put: if you're new to the Ramones and didn't have this album before, by all means, pick this up. If you're like me, and you've owned the vinyl or tape for decades, pass on this. I have to agree with reviewer &quot;9pretzel&quot;, this remastered/expanded set isn't worth your money. These songs are undeniably among the best to come from the 70s punk scene because they were stripped down. It's what the Ramones were pretty much about! What marketing assistant thought it a good idea to expand on the masters of minimalism? It reeks of packaging and profit. Do yourself a favor, find a second- or third-hand music store and buy a used copy of the album.<br />Joey and Dee Dee, Rest In Punk.
B00000J7JO|5.0|With 15 great songs on this album you can't go wrong.  I first heard &quot;around the world&quot; on the radio and I was hooked.  That song is perfect- catchy, fun, great chorus.  The chili peppers are the perfect rock rap combo.  Other great singles off this album that you've probably heard include: Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, Otherside, Californication.  Once you've purchased this album immediently go to these songs:<BR>Porcelain- nice and soft and melodic.<BR>Emit Remmus- Great vocals<BR>Road Trippin'- Perfect end to a perfect cd.
B000002KCC|5.0|The long history of rock and roll is filled with many incongruities. One of the more SEEMING incongruities has already been identified by several reviewers (I didn't read them all, so this may be old hat) and that is the punk feel in this mostly accoustic album. But this shouldn't be surprising. In a 1977 interview, Johnny (Rotten) Lydon stated that Neil Young was a major influence on him, and that TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT impressed him the most. Neil returned the compliment in \\"Hey, Hey, My, My\\" with the lyric: \\"The King is gone but he's not forgotten/This is the story of Johnny Rotten\\".<br />Obviously, the influence wasn't musical. The influence wasn't in attitude, either: much of TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT howls with pain and despair, NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS...\\" growls with anger and mockery. The true influence writhes in the convulsions, the hoarse screams, the rawness of the emotions. There's a fury and an outrage in these albums that is unsuppressed. It's little wonder that Kurt Cobain would be the logical heir of this legacy. (Another seeming incongruity: Kurt Cobain's suicide note contains Neil Young's lyric \\"It's better to burn out than to fade away\\". And Neil wrote the sorrowful \\"Sleeps with Angels\\" about Cobaine's suicide.)<br />Nearly thirty years later the raw wounds still fester; the album has withstood the proverbial test of time. I won't go through each song individually because I would just be repeating what other reviewers have said. But it is worth repeating how powerful this album is.
0385507755|3.0|Although I'm not an addict, I was the editor of an journal for addictions counselors for many years. As such, I read hundreds of stories about the agony of addiction. This one is a standout, but not necessarily for the reasons you might think. Like most, it has all the requisite excretory delights: the blood, the spit, the snot, the urine, the vomit (and vomit, and vomit, and just when you think it's over ... more vomit) described in excruciating detail. It's got the rock-bottomed protagonist, the pathetically helpless loved ones, the heroic counselors, the supportive fellow addicts, even a tragically codependent love interest. What sets this tale apart is something that makes me both like and dislike the author. I was compelled by the fact that he eschews all things AA (especially the \\"higher power\\" nonsense, which I always had a problem with myself). His determination to go it alone in recovery is a nice twist from the usual \\"let go and let god\\" proslytizing. However, at the same time, I was repelled by the author's ludicrously childish tough-guy act. Frey would have us believe that he was beating and torturing people almost from the time he could walk, to the point where he ascribes to himself an almost-psychotic anti-social personality disorder. He admits throughout the book that he has done unspeakably abusive things to everyone who's ever come within 10 feet of him, and yet, they can't get enough of him. His parents fall all over themselves to win his acceptance even though he has to fight off going into a rage if they so much as try to hug him. A mobster he befriends in therapy wants him to be the son he never had. The counselors and psychologists all develop a deep admiration and respect for him despite the fact that he ridicules and belittles their work and everything they stand for. At the end, you find yourself doubting that someone this immature and angry could possibly have a single person in his life who wouldn't flee in horror at the sight of him, letalone maintain a successful recovery.    EDIT: I'm adding this paragraph now that this book and its author have been revealed as frauds. As I wrote in the final line back in 2004, something about this book always seemed suspect to me. What a shame that so many honest books about genuine struggles against addiction will languish in the shadow of this contrived farce.
0743490304|4.0|You'll like Deception Point.  To say that Deception Point is as ingeniously crafted as The Da Vinci Code would be fallacious.  However, that being said, to say that it is a letdown would also be erroneous.  Although I found Angels &amp; Demons and The Da Vinci Code to be of a superior writing quality, Deception Point is no slouch by any means.  Deception Point, albeit a singularly unique effort from his other works in being a political/scientific thriller, equally engrosses the reader just the same with Dan Brown's customary edge of your seat thrill-ride waiting to happen type of writing style.<br />Perhaps two minor peccadilloes with Deception Point would be the incessantly bumbling idiocy of the (supposedly elite but I can't tell by reading this book)Delta Force and the fact that President Herney sends an adviser to debate his Presidential candidate.  Although there also exist many hyperboles to boot, Deception Point is, for all intents and purposes, a suspenseful page-turner that practically reads itself; it will, without a doubt, prove seemingly impossible to put down for anyone who enjoyed The Da Vinci Code.
B00006BTCA|3.0|&quot;See, Christian music is so easy to write. All you have to do is take a regular song and change lyrics like 'I need you baby' to 'I need you Jesus...'&quot;<br />Basically, Interpol has taken 11 good pre-existing songs, retooled the music a bit, rewritten the lyrics, and come up with their first full-length album. The good thing, though, is that even though the band lacks in originality, it makes up for it by imitating the best indie artists.<br />The two obvious musical clones I can think of are:<br />Track 5: &quot;Say Hello to the Angels&quot; = &quot;This Charming Man&quot; by the Smiths<br />Track 6: &quot;Hands Away&quot; = &quot;Hoarfrost&quot; by Sonic Youth<br />Less specifically, Tracks 1, 4, and 7 are definite KOD rewrites taken from the album Strange Free World. And,Track 2 I am certain was once written by the Talking Heads (notice the David Byrne voice imitation).<br />However, all comparisons to Joy Division are wrong, I don't think the singer sounds at all like Ian Curtis. Please note, &quot;Leif Erikson&quot; is the strongest song on the album.
B00005MP58|5.0|Highly recommended -- you will tell yourself that you are going to watch it like a miniseries, but you won't want to turn it off.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There were 10 stars on this great show, including Serenity herself.  FOX was foolish to air the episodes out of sequence; I didn't catch on to the quality and depth of this show until my wife made me watch the DVDs in the proper order.  I think that one short-sighted mistake probably cost Joss and his incredible cast their opportunity to keep dazzling us with more and more Firefly.<br />Really, how can you argue in favor of cancel a show whose creator and cast can do episodes like &quot;The Message&quot;.  It's obvious the rapport that the cast and crew shared just in watching the episodes.  And what is truly amazing is that it seems like they built this rapport so quickly...much quicker than the short span of only 14 episodes.  <br />I hope Joss will be succesful in getting the Firefly movie back in the air, or even better, the series.  The only bad part of the DVD collection was knowing that there should have been more to come.  I'd love to know what happens next.<br />Thanks Joss and the cast of Firefly!<br />Boo FOX!!!
B0000DJZA5|1.0|I really do not understand why they want to release Let it Be...Naked at this point since 'they' really now is 90% Paul and 10% Ringo. The feel of 'Paul' is everywhere in the album, sorry to say but that was how I feel when I heard it. The songs became 'studiofied' and dull replacing the magic and special quality that the album supposed to have. And what is up with the drumming, I thought Ringo did a better job. Instead of making the drumming more interesting, they actually made it more systematic. If you listen to Ringo's drumming in the White Album, all of the later music for that matter, it sounds nothing like this one. And don't get me started with Don't Let Me Down. It hurts me very much to hear the version in this album and the guitar solo in Let It Be? Well, Harrison decided to replace the Fuzz to a scaly pucking. Good one Paul, you did it again!
B0000524CY|1.0|I just don't understand the avid adoration of this film!  It's right up there with the over-rated &quot;Amityville Horror&quot;...neither one of these films is scary or even necessarily watchable.  Yes I watched it alone.  And at night.  I was bored out of my mind. <br />It's graphic.  It's necessarily rated R.  It's about a little girl who gets posessed for some reason that no one wants to share with us.  And um...that's about it.<br />The makeup and special effects are laughably bad and haven't stood up well to time--maybe people think this was good for the 70's?  I've seen better from back then.  I'm old!  <BR>Why is a fake rotating head scary? I know this film is from the 70's.  I know it's a &quot;classic&quot;.  I know Avacado was a really popular color back then, but PLEASE people, vomit is rarely--if ever--bright green.  And I'm still trying to figure out why a demon would make a kid pee on the floor.  What does that have to do with ANYTHING? Why is that scary?!!  <br />I don't feel anything for these characters.  What did this kid do to get posessed in the first place?  I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen like that... don't you have to invite that sort of thing on yourself?  Why do people always assume that demons care what religion you are?  That demons would care about religious stuff at all for that matter?  I think 99% of this film was done for shock value which is the ONLY reason it's a cult classic.  <br />Please, for the love of God, watch the original 1960's version of &quot;Psycho&quot; or &quot;The Changeling&quot; or &quot;Jaws&quot;...just watch something else!  There are so many other good movies that are worth watching.<br />As for me, I want my two hours back.
0553260111|5.0|I was encouraged to read the Bourne Identity due to my mother's persuassion and my love of spy novels.  Of course, I was eager to try a new author since I had read at least twelve of John Grisham's in a row and was needing a break from the lawyer frenzy.  In the midst I found myself caught up in the unusual twists and the unsuspecting turns of this phenominal book.  Ludlum is an extraordinary author who has an amazing ability to captivate your mind.  <BR>    The twists in this book are far greater than what is reflected in the movie.  Hollywood, will be Hollywood, thus adding material that is nonexistant in the book in order to spice things up.  Unfortunately for Ludlum's advent readers, we were given a waterdowned version of an extraordinary novel.
B00004ZD69|4.0|Alright, I got this CD on impulse because it thad an intriguing title. The music was decent; long classicalish pieces interspersed with bizzare snippets of randomness - I d give it three stars; it was a bit slow in some places, and I didn't notice too much that was truly spectacular. I'll give them another half-star for the two pictures on the CD container; which were truly insane: One seemed to be a masked Ben Franklin snipping off some guy's hands with some scissors. The other had the masked Ben Franklin and a masked, 3-armed George Washington trying to make some slacker wear a suit as the no-handed guy protrudes from a cloud with an odd expression on his face. That makes 3.5, and they can have another half-star for giving the impression that there's some deep political statement embedded in the album that as of yet I have failed to grasp. Pick it up if you need to replenish your supply of randomness.
B00005ATQF|3.0|To date there is no film that is more accurate a depiction of Parris Island Marine Corps recruit training than this (I speak from first-hand experience).  My Third Battalion platoon endured the same level of ridicule from two of our junior Drill Instructors (not the third junior or Senior Drill Instructor), and we took our share of beatings from them and even beat on each other every now and then.  It was not a wild rampage of chaos but the result of conforming and adjusting to a team mentality where we all understood and accepted the required level of commitment and sacrifice that the title of Marine might some day demand of us.  Lee Ermey (FMJ's Senior Drill Instructor) was himself an actual Marine Corps Drill Instructor.  He gave a believable performance in The Boys in Company C during the late 1970's, but the setting was the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego; quite different in it's depiction of basic training than Full Metal Jacket.    The boot camp scene in FMJ had all the look and feel of Parris Island, especially the super-wide cement and brick squad-bays of Second Battalion, which faces the Parris Island parade field.  The foot lockers, racks (beds), rifles and other equipment, the drill instructor's commands and tactics, the running chants, the behaviors of the recruits, and the entire mood of the boot camp scene is incredibly accurate.  I can see how people who have served in other services or different eras of the Corps might not be able to agree, but my experience at Parris Island WAS the Lee Ermey exprience.  A typical platoon started with 72 recruits and graduated with 50-60.  One platoon in another series actually graduated 25 out of its original 70.  It was that tough physically and psychologically.  Rifle Range suicides were common.  I saw one.  Many times the drill instructors would order us off of equipment, as Gunny Hartman did to D'Onofrio's character Private \\"Pyle\\" (a common use of reverse psychology on those who were naturally prone to giving up), but God help the recruit who did give up and jump off.  I was ordered off of obstacles many times but I never heeded the orders because I understood their tactics.  I pressed forward and overcame my weeknesses.  After graduation we expected to shake hands and have our pictures taken with our drill instructors, but instead they ordered us, \\"the f**k off my G*dd**n island!!!\\"     With all this said, Lee Ermey's character was a loud, obnoxious, wild-eyed, inhuman beast who was \\"full of piss and vinegar,\\" and nothing even remotely compassionate.  But that's how it was.  I highly recommend that anyone who is curious about the Marine Corps basic training environment (at least how it was) buy this disc and supplement it with true film footage from a modern Discovery Channel series called, The Making of Marines.    The post-boot camp footage of inner city fighting in Viet Nam seemed disorganized and rushed.  Truly that's the way it is in combat no matter how focused the objective, but it does not wash in theatrical productions, especially with regards to the fine craftsmanship of the first half of FMJ.  Some of the scenes are exceptionally realistic, like the pandering and prostitution and the phrases that were exchanged, and also quite chilling, as the scene where a sniper draws a few Marines into an ambush and repeatedly injures them in an attempt to draw in the rest of the squad.  The horror on the young mens' faces when they discover the sniper is a woman delivers what is perhaps the most gripping scene in the movie.  It is the kind of thing that leaves a person thinking long after the show is over.    This may well have been a theatrical anti-war protest, but I think it solidly appeals to people on both sides of the fence and certainly opens the door to some serious thinking...\\"What if this were me, my son, brother, uncle, etc...what if they experience this in days to come...how shall I relate to them and how shall I regard what their country country called them to do?\\"    Because of the extreme profanity and graphic violence I would not recommend this to children of any age.  Some adults will cringe as well.  But it is a film worth seeing and evaluating.  I also recommend Platoon, Hamburger Hill, and We Were Soldiers.    With a feeling of (questionably sadistic?) nostalgia: SEMPER FI
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I love every album Iron Maiden has ever put out (excluding the ones with Blaze, cuz those don't count), but I found this one hard to get into.  It has a more jolly, happy sound to it and it is a big change for the band.  The first song, as well as the song &quot;Dance of Death&quot; are two of my favorites on here.  I absolutely loved Brave New World, but it seemed like not enough time was put into this album.  Maybe it was simply rushed a bit.  Most songs are very bland and lack the old Maiden riffs that force you to get excited as hell!!!  Bruce's voice was not as strong and clear in this album either.  I will continue to listen to this album, as all Maiden fans should, but this is my honest first impulse.  Keep the IRONS UP!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|to get to this forum i had to choose a rating for the dvd. I gave it a 1. In truth, there is nothing wrong with the dvd. The 1 is actually for the movie.<BR>i love Murray and it was really a pleasure to watch him in many of the scenes doing a lower key of humor. But, NOTHING ELSE WAS FUNNY! The &quot;america meets japan&quot; stuff was 40 years old at least.<BR>three quarters of the way through i gave up and turned it off.<BR>If this gets an academy award for anything it will be right up there with the one given to Kim Bassinger.
B00005JKDR|3.0|Yeeahh . . . I was expecting something in the way of Toy Story and that might have been the problem.  This movie about quirky monsters provided a couple of grins, but mostly groans and eye-rolling galore.  Maybe I'm too old now, who knows?
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I will always remember Steven Spielberg hosting interviews during documentaries of his life detailing stories of himself being misunderstood as a child, which says in a nutshell a passage in life all of us can relate to. So it was his inspiration to transfer that simple idea into such an unforgettable film as E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL. Melissa Matheson's screenplay is among one of the most remarkable achievements ever accomplished in cinema history. It is so simple and yet so compelling. The story of young Elliott who is a simple boy from Elementary School, longing for companionship with the separation of his parents. He lives with his Mother Mary (Dee Wallace Stone in one of her very first), older brother Michael (Robert Macnaughton), and younger sister Gertie (7-year old Drew Barrymore). One day he gets the shock of his life when an alien from outer space crash lands on Earth to pay him a visit he will never forget.<br />So simple, and yet so compelling. As such it is a story for the audience to never forget. Steven Spielberg has been an inspiration for future filmmakers to come, and perhaps will always be remembered for such films as the INDIANA JONES trilogies, SCHINDLER'S LIST, and the many other films to follow. That is the reason I think E.T. is easy to become forgotten about every now and then because in today's film culture it becomes so simple to neglect the subleties invigorated into crafting such films that inspire others and take inspiration from simple ideas everyone can relate to.<br />There is humor and drama aplenty, Elliott showing E.T. simple things such as Star Wars action figures, watching television, or moments while away at school while E.T. finds his way around the house, Elliott begans hallucinating into his very thoughts. So their personalities become combined as one. It weaves the theme of being protective and caring as friends, as Elliott vows to protect E.T. from the government officials and safe from sunlight. The DVD is a real treat as it includes such delights as:<br />Production notes<BR>A special introduction by Steven Spielberg<BR>Live performance of John Williams' 2002 orchestra<BR>Space Explorations<BR>The original 1982 and enhanced 2002 versions<BR>\\"Spotlight on Location\\" featurette<BR>The Reunion: The cast and filmmakers discuss the impact of the films<BR>The Evolution and Creation of ET: hundreds of production photographs, conceptual drawings and original advertising in an interactive environment<BR>DVD-ROM features with Total Axess includes behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, and more<BR>Widescreen anamorphic format<br />Such an extraordinary film to date and even more so because it helped launch the careers' of many famous faces today not only Drew Barrymore, but C. Thomas Howell, and for those of you unfamiliar with movie trivia - that's 13 year old Erika Eleniak playing the girl in class Elliott can't take his eyes off. A sure winner - which should never be forgotten! Why aren't there more like this?
B00008LDPU|4.0|The Matrix was a film that appealed to many different groups of people for many different reasons. For some, it was a masterful tribute to video games and martial arts movies. For others, it was a populist gateway into a branch of philosophy by a couple of outstanding visual artists. It left many of us in awe, a visual and mentally stimulating treat.<br />Animatrix is a collection of eight or nine (&quot;The Second Renaissance&quot; has been broken into two halves) animated shorts which explore various aspects of the Wachowskis' Matrix universe. Some come across as &quot;fan fiction&quot;, featuring some of the stars from the first movie; others are designed to prepare the viewer for the two sequels Reloaded and Revolutions, others still simply explore the world itself or the consequences of its philosophy.<br />Three of the most interesting pieces are The Second Renaissance, Beyond, and Matriculated. The latter turns the Matrix universe upside down and explores the idea of putting a sentient robot into a virtual universe to instill in it an empathy with humans. There's some very surreal imagery in this thoughtful, witty, piece. &quot;Beyond&quot; explores a &quot;what if&quot; situation where a part of the world simulated by the Matrix has been corrupted. It's a very sweet story about a woman and some children who play in a &quot;haunted house&quot; before the bug is detected.<br />Most dramatic is &quot;The Second Renaissance&quot;, a pseudo-history of the events that lead up to the machine's enslavement of humanity. This is stunning graphically, and covers a story that falls outside traditional shallow Hollywood story telling. At a time culturally when self-criticism sometimes seems to be considered a form of treason, the story describes a decadent humanity which creates a new sentient life form and fails to respect it, moving through a path variously of exploitation, vengeance, fear, desperation, and finally submission. Directed by Mahiro Maeda, and with a stunning score from Don Davis, the piece uses humanoid robots and strong external references to overcome the viewer's natural disattachment to the machines.<br />Animatrix contains many scenes which may be unpleasant to the young, and - perhaps I'm over-reacting - but knowing the kind of emotional and mental impact The Matrix series has on many people, I was a tad concerned about the potential affect one of the pieces, Kid's Story, might have on a depressed teen. Those who enjoyed the Matrix series for the action may find themselves disliking a substantial portion of Animatrix, as with one or two exceptions they're not those kinds of stories. It's worth noting that all the films are fairly short, averaging less than ten minutes each.<br />I do wish I'd watched this before seeing Reloaded. Either way, I suspect most people who loved the Matrix in some way will find something in this to enjoy. There's some highly intelligent, thoughtful, beautifully scored, provocative visual masterpieces on this DVD, it's certainly worth a look.
B000002G6J|5.0|Close your eyes, forget about names and time. If you do that, you can picture &quot;The Red House&quot;, the now-legendary &quot;Triste&quot;, the 3/4 &quot;Mojave&quot; or &quot;Lamento&quot; being recorded by some of the 21st century's hottest chillout acts... but truth is that it's yet another revival (not implying that today's work lacks value or originality)... quite simply, Tom Jobim did this back 1967, with his new Bossa (Bossa Nova) in this follow through to classics such as &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;, &quot;One Note Samba&quot; and &quot;Desafinado&quot;.<br />Digitally mastered and engineered by mega-producer Rudy Van Gelder, this reissue of Jobim's 'Wave' blends in a perfect mix of downtempo, romantic tunes with upbeat tracks that bring out the best in Bossa Nova from the father of the genre himself, for the new generation and those who heard the music back in the days, to enjoy alike.
B00006RCNW|5.0|the bottom line is this is darn near perfect. It is absolutely the most intense show i've ever seen. (yea 24 fans, this IS more intense)<br />i've been a fan of 24 since the beginning and i used to think that nothing could beat it...i, like most other fans was very angry when chiklis won the golden globe a few years back over keiffer. but after seeing what an awsome performance chiklis does in this show...i can see why he won.<br />One of my friends told me to watch it a few weeks ago so i decided to check it out. The very next day i was ordering this set. I just couldn't contain myself! <br />for the next 3 days my life was taken over by this show...thats right 13 episodes in 3 friggin days....<br />There is not one bad episode out of the 13. Everyone is soo dramatic and there is ALWAYS something happening. <br />Chicklis is not the only great actor. Dutch is one of my favorites. Theres honestly no character i don't like, no character like, kim bauers in 24, who i just don't care about...i actually want to learn more about everyone...their all so deep and intriguing. <br />there is a lot of violence and sexuality so its not appropriate for younger kids. also it doesn't seem all that realistic. i'm not a cop nor am i familiar with what real cops in LA do but i don't thinks its perfectly accurate.  <br />I'm now going through the 2nd season...limiting myself to 2 episodes a day to make it last a little longer...and its just as intense if not more...Season 3 starts in march.<br />So what are you waiting for!!! theres no need to read the other reviews cause they all say the same thing...I've always been told that nothing is perfect but this is pretty darn close.
B00004BZ16|5.0|&quot;In these days, with no love to give/<BR>The world will turn with no one left to live.&quot;<BR>-&quot;Kingston Advice&quot;<br />If a record like SANDINISTA! were released in 2004, it would be hailed as an utter masterpiece, a daring, inventive, amazing trip though the music of several continents and generations.  But instead, it is consistently bashed as a &quot;failure&quot; or worse, and most reviewers quote the tired &quot;in these three LPs there is one great album&quot; or whatever.  <br />But I dare you to pick the &quot;best&quot; songs off this record and leave the artistic vision intact.  Most fairweather Clash fans would certainly exclude &quot;Lose This Skin,&quot; &quot;Washington Bullets,&quot; &quot;Something About England,&quot; &quot;Kingston Advice,&quot; &quot;Hitsville UK&quot; and several of the &quot;dub&quot; tracks (what these days are called &quot;remixes&quot;) in favor of classic hits like &quot;The Magnificent Seven,&quot;  &quot;Charlie Don't Surf,&quot; &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot; and &quot;Police on my Back.&quot;  However, picking and choosing in this manner plays havoc with history, the artists' intentions, and fetishizes a certain view of the Clash as an artistic unit.  <br />In fact, those above-mentioned (&quot;overlooked&quot;) songs are some of the Clash's best, most progressive, and most daring works.  Compared to the musical complexity of &quot;Something About England,&quot; the &quot;Mag-7&quot; clone &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot; is simplistic and almost corny.  Why the latter came to define the record in some people's minds is beyond me.  <br />Of course, the Clash might have gone a tad overboard on the non-musical trifles here (the weird radio host who asks who holds the key that winds up Big Ben, the kid singing &quot;Guns of Brixton,&quot; and even the pre-&quot;Lightning Strikes&quot; dread radio show.) But the silliness of the filler on Outkast's SPEAKERBOXXX/THE LOVE BELOW&quot;  are never brought up in thosereviews, though it, also a double CD, is widely-considered the greatest record in a generation.  That such insignificant goofing around would raise the ire of some listeners is incredible.  The fact is that not a single song on this record can be called dispassionate or rote.  Perhaps some are better than others, but at every point the Clash are in top form artistically.  Compare this to 1982's COMBAT ROCK which, while not lacking in honorable experimentation and amazing tracks, is truly a disjointed, sloppy effort in some ways, and it is a third the length of SANDINISTA!  In contrast, COMBAT ROCK has several tracks which were poorly-conceived at best and not even well-produced (&quot;Red Angel Dragnet,&quot; &quot;Death is a Star&quot;), but this is overlooked because of the popularity of &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; and &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go?&quot; two fine songs which are equalled many times over on SANDINISTA! (&quot;Police on my Back,&quot; &quot;Ivan Meets GI Joe&quot;) and the powerhouse cut &quot;Straight to Hell,&quot; certainly one of the best songs the Clash ever recorded, with outstanding production here.  <br />The Clash saw themselves, rightly, as the leading force in rock and punk, doing what other great artists have always done: looking beyond the sure bet, ever-striving to expand the boundaries of popular music and blend popular culture in the west with politics as they truly only are in the Third World.  Above all SANDINISTA! is a political document.  The courage of the Clash and other groups to stand up to the rising right-wing alliance of Reaganism and Thatcherism saved punk and rock music for our own generation through a bleak, dark time.  With this record the Clash put themselves squarely on the side of the world's oppressed in their battle against imperialism, and without it I believe music would look very different.<br />So here's one of the most underrated records of all time.  <br />&quot;Every cell in Chile will tell <BR>The cry of the tortured man.  <BR>Remember Allende in the days before<BR>Before the army came.<BR>Please remember Victor Jara <BR>In the Santiago stadium.<BR>Es verdad...those Washington Bullets again.&quot;<BR>-&quot;Washington Bullets&quot;

B000002UDB|5.0|MMT is a great Beatles album. While it may not be as cohesive as Pepper's or Abbey Road, the individual songs are excellent. Oh, and despite what some others have written, Flying is a great instrumental!
B00005LQ04|5.0|This is probably one of the most artistic film from the italian master of horror Dario Argento.  The colors are so beautiful and the atmosphere keeps you into a really scary and strange tension from the beginning to end.  The music is also great and it fits really well with this witches story that is not very surprising but well directed and very interesting and the murders scenes are very horrifying.   If you want to buy this masterpiece, I really recommanded this special edition because it contains a 25th anniversary interview with the people who worked on this film and also the great soundtrack from the Goblins. You won`t be disappointed!!!!!!!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The movie was right. It was one of the best movies i seen that month. That was like the only movie that continued it correctly. Like in the first one i thought Gandolf was dead when he got pulled of the cliff or bridge. because they didn't show where or how he had landed. You had to opinionate what happen. But in the 2nd one they showed clips from the 1st one and show what happen to him. I also like the characters in the movie and the battle and where the battle took place.
B00005JM0B|2.0|Don't see. Really, there are much better things to do.
B00005JMGL|5.0|Peter Pan is by far the best movie i have ever seen in my life. It is so sweet, the whole wendy and peter thing that had going. And at the end when her kiss saved him, me and all the other girls i was watching the movie with cried our eyes out. And it doesn't just apply to girls, the fighting scenes are amazing..they really did a good job. Jeremy Sumpter is awesome, he is precious too..his smile, thats all i have to say. That movie makes me want a hot guy to come be my peter pan and take me to neverland...wendy is so lucky i do believe. Anyway i would recomend this movie to everyone, its the best EVERRRRR!
B000001G89|5.0|Carmen was the first opera I ever heard and to this day I think that there's no greater Carmen than Julia Migenes but Berganza, de los Angeles and Callas come VERY close indeed. I have a Carmen-video with Berganza where she is just MAGNIFICENT as the Spanish temptress. Changing from Rosina etc. to Carmen might be a little surprising but, oh my, who would have thought that the young singer who was Callas' eqxuisite partner in the legendary Dallas Medea would bloom to such heights? A very tasty habanera, a wicked segeduilla and a dark card-scene... She is superb in the dramatic finale where her partner, Placido Domingo, sounds equally stunning. Domingo sang on three complete Carmens and even though I prefer the Migenes-Domingo recording for its dramatic finish and the Troyanos-Domingo recording for vocal splendour this is a great recording indeed. Esp. the Flower-aria is exquisitely sung. I never cared much for Milnes and find his Escamillo not to be quite idiomatic (Ruggero Raimondi is just unbeatable) but he's quite alright. A MUST for every Carmen-lover!
6305907145|2.0|Not as witty as the book, this film is rahter boring and goes on and on and on... Main character is not as gentle as in the book but rather pushy and self-aware. Not a good adaptation of the book if that is what the producer was aiming for.
0312995423|3.0|Had high hopes for this ... I wanted to like it more. It got started well, but I thought this book was trying too hard to be like a screenplay-ready Crichton novel. While entertaining, the story line became somewhat predictable.
B00013PHGS|4.0|It's not Moon Safari.  This would have been a good follow up.  &quot;Run Run Run&quot; is a beautiful and sublime song that would hold it's own with anything on Moon Safari.  Other songs are similar in style to &quot;Playground Love&quot; from Virgin Suicides.

And well kids that are 3 or four or whatever dont know about psychos or anything like that. This book was read to me when I was 2-7 and I still love it! Man you people are crazy not to love this book and you have too much free time on your hands if you can point out all the bad sides to it. And hey, when I got to the very last page where he stands at the top of the stairs I didnt know it was about death. And its not like this really happenes or anything. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN OF ALL AGES!!!!!!!!!! You parents who hate this book need to get your minds out of the gutter and get something to do.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|This is possibly the best movie I have ever seen. This movie ties in the stories of many, all eventually connecting in one spectacular plot. Each actor/actress did so incredibly wonderful in each role that this movie shines in a way very few others have hopes of doing. With great focus on the story at hand without the distraction of irrelevant details, the only complaint I have about this movie is that it didn't last longer. With so much to tell, the plot could have been divided into 4 or 5 different movies. I really hope that they release a Special Edition with extras in the near future.

Ileana Cotrubas is one of the most touching Gildas, listen to her tearful \\"Tutte le feste\\" or her angelic \\"Lassu in cielo\\" where she sings exquisite pianissimi! Just sublime! Young Domingo might sound a little dark as Duke but his performance is riveting, charming and very sexy sounding. Now THAT is a womanizer! Cappuccilli has much Italianita as Rigoletto, what a temperament in \\"Cortigiani\\" and what haunting pathos in the finale. One of the best Rigolettos around! Two thumbs up! A++++++++++++++++++
B00011RPB0|5.0|'Lost in Translation' is a very layered work of film art that is hard for most to come to grip with.  On the surface it appears to be one thing; lonely husband and wife of different ages find they have lonliness in common in Tokyo and grow friendship.  But, this film is so much craftier.  Sophia did her homework, and the critics and sceptics haven't hit the nail on the head yet.<br />Ms. Coppola makes a stunning ode to Tokyo with her very scant story covering lush visuals filmed totally within Japan.  It is a work of love to a culture vastly different from the west, yet so similar in most esoteric ways.  The writing/direction made the general American audiences fall in love with the story of two people who find their 'soulmate' in a city where everything moves at a different tempo and style from the main characters.  Frankly, this could have been shot anywhere; city people stuck in red-neck America, or earth tone dressers caught in the all-black NYC/LA of today, or beet growers working in a town of cattle barons.  The story is basically showing two people so divorced from those around them that they become similar.  The choice of Tokyo allows Sophia to protray a city/country so few can portray due to the cultural gap.  <br />However, her story is the biggest, mad trick on the audience.  Sophia engages audiences to believe and love two characters who, while charming in themselves, are spoiled, pampered souls.  Charolotte and Bob (Johnasen and Murray) are basically taking the easy way out in a world where their better halves are working and striving to secure futures, homes and families, and these two primaries are unable to sleep or function in their plush cages within Tokyo.  It expemplifies the saying 'Idle hands do the Devils work.'  With time and boredom comes frustration and sin.  While charming and sweet, Ms. Coppola examines this rather one trick relationship by showing that the characters only have one thing in common, and despite their 'love' there isn't a lot that would bind them aside from the fact that they share ilde lonliness.<br />On so many levels, this rather slow, indulgent film displays an amazing depth of character writing and a boldness of film and timing I haven't seen for years.  Granted, this film isn't a timeless masterpiece, but it is a very perochial masterpiece due to the amount of sadly typical films that spew the market in America.  All the negatives people display in reviews are actually positives.  All the postive reviews merely back the adept writing/film making of 'Translation'.  It is a really great film to see and dwell on.  While it isn't a film for everyone, it is a film for many, and is a unique experience for most.  Don't let it go unwatched.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I've been listening to Iron Maiden since the release of POWERSLAVE a couple of decades ago (geez, has it been that long?!). As most longtime fans of Maiden are aware, Maiden underwent a period of decline in the 90s that saw them put out a number of somewhat uninspired (though still competent) albums. But that's all water under the bridge now, as Maiden have made a triumphant comeback with BRAVE NEW WORLD and, now, with the even better DANCE OF DEATH.<br />DANCE OF DEATH is easily one of Maiden's best albums. Yes, it's even comparable in quality to their classic works from the 80s (the first seven studio albums plus a couple of live recordings, including the godly LIVE AFTER DEATH). That's not to say DOD sounds exactly like old Iron Maiden; the style is still there, but the sound is more powerful and the music is considerably more complex. They really took advantage of the three-guitarist line-up on this album, with lots of multilayered riffs and harmonies that pull you right in. The lead playing on this album is exceptionally good -- the best I've ever heard from Maiden -- and the bass and drums are outstanding as well. Perfect production that lets you hear every instrument distinctly is another feature of DOD, and the lyrics are interesting as well.<br />My only criticism of DOD is that the &quot;softer&quot; parts of a couple songs seem to drag on a little bit longer than I'd like, but this is really a minor flaw that merely lengthens a couple of songs; it doesn't cut into the amount of &quot;heavy stuff&quot; at all.<br />DOD is packed with really catchy and memorable riffs and melodies, some of which can even give you goosebumps. After listening to this CD a few times, my favorite songs are probably &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;, &quot;Montsegur&quot;, &quot;New Frontier&quot;, and &quot;Age Of Innocence&quot;; the weakest song is probably &quot;No More Lies,&quot; but really the whole album is fantastic. I noticed that the entire band contributed to the songwriting effort on DOD, and that might account for its fresh and innovative character.<br />I strongly urge everyone out there who thought Maiden was no longer relevant to pick up DANCE OF DEATH. This band deserves a tremendous amount of credit for putting out such a devastatingly powerful and intensely moving album.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|A curious movie, in the mould of David Lynch.<BR>Donnie Darko is a film you'll either going to love and hate.<BR>The 80's election setting is a very original and Frank The Rabbit is decidedly creepy. Drew Barrymore is rather sexy as a rogue teacher.
B0000029GA|5.0|Anyone who says that this isn't at least in the top three hip-hop albums of all time doesn't know what they are talking about.  Some people argue that its quality is tarnished by the fact that Nas didn't actually live the life talked about in the album.  However, Illmatic isn't written in the style of Biggie or Mobb Deep or any of those. Instead, Nas plays the role of a viewer watching what is happening around him and conversing with those who have suffered the tragedy of the streets (particularly in One Love).  The multiple rhyme patterns in each line while maintaining a deep and powerful meaning behind each song only proves how great Nas could have been. Unfortunately, he now sucks.  Still Illmatic, to me, is the best rap album of all time, even over Ready to Die and 36 Chambers.  Songs like Memory Lane, One Love, It Ain't Hard to Tell, and It's Yours will never fade in skill or depth.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I have no idea why the DVD is listed here as unavailable. I have as yet been unable to ascertain why this fine movie has been released then pulled (or so it would seem). If you have pre-ordered this item here, then you should be receiving it. <br />Now, on to the details:<BR>-The extras are great, especially if you are a fan of either Tim Burton or Johnny Depp. The Tor Johnson deleted scene is fabulous, and I wonder why all the deleted scenes were not included in the original cut.<BR> <BR>-The movie is fabulous. I can only wonder how much is actual fact and how much is \\"based on.\\"<br />-Bill Murray is great in this film. If you want to get an idea how this former goofball actor built up his dramatic chops, start here. <br />If Ed Wood is your personal movie director hero, or if you just want a great insight into a sick mind, then get this film. Definitely in my top five list of DVD releases.
0553208845|3.0|The book was a mandatory read for English II honors.  The book was slow paced, a different view with Buddasim.  I can't say the book was exciting, and it was hard to finish.  The book did have good points to it.  The end was good.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I just don't get it!  Is it the hype?  'Cmon is there any detectable vocal talent here? Sorry, but just can't find it on this album! Her voice is so achey on this album that it's painful to listen to, like ER at 2am.  Freaky! The farther you get into the album the more excruciating it becomes.  Hello Rhythm!  Are you home?  I am afraid to see what people look like dancing to this, seriously scary.  Too bad she learned nothing from Madonna except publicity stunts.  This pop is so flat that this album belongs with that open Pepsi sitting out for day (although tastes like years).  There are far better ways to waste your money.  So awful, it isn't worth the dust.
0395951054|3.0|I can't stand it when people post reviews which point out factual errors made by other reviewers, as this is usually done to show off their own knowledge rather than out of any charitable impulse to correct a wrong. That having been said, I have to do just that the two official Amazon reviews of this book posted at the top, one or both by Sunny Delaney, who should have checked the facts before posting them as such.<br />The original July 18, 1925 release of \\"Mein Kampf\\" was not a failure as stated. In point of fact this first printing of 10,000 hardback books sold 9, 473 copies in less than six months, despite a depressed economy and a relatively high price of 12 marks. If the printing had been a failure, Munich publisher Franz Eher would never have ordered a second in 1926. The second edition was in fact a disappointment, sales dropping off sharply in following years, and it was not until the Nazis gained significantly more momentum in Germany years later that additional editions were ordered. However, it is recorded that Hitler gained a substantial, if temporary, income from royalties of his book, and it may have financed or partially financed the 28,000-mark Mercedes-Benz he bought when released from Landsberg prison.<br />I understand that most people cannot even fake objectivity about Hitler as a historical figure because of the things he did and set in motion, but that is not an excuse for getting the facts wrong. \\"Mein Kampf\\" was by no means a runaway success, but neither was it a failure. It neither fulfilled the lofty expectations Hitler had for it nor flopped on its face as so many of his critics (and there were many, even in 1925) hoped. Hitler, as it happened, had no respect for objective truth and bent it to suit his purposes and his whims; in studying his life, career, and beliefs, we have an obligation to do the exact opposite and get the facts straight. There are enough myths, legends, and outright lies about this crucially important figure of modern history told every day without committing any more of them to print.n history told every day without committing any more of them to print.
B000002WPI|5.0|Great CD. Illmatic is the only one out there better. Clan in da Front is my favorite track because GZA just gets on the mic and rips it up.  Obviously CREAM and METHOD Man are other classic tracks.  I also love Shame, particularly Method Man's verse.
0676973760|5.0|I reviewed this book for my book club, and it was by far our favorite. Each person had a slightly different interpretation, and that is the mark of a good storyteller. But as we discussed, the themes centred on spirituality, fear, raw human survival, and the delicate perception of reality - and then we realized how incredible this story really was. This book runs deep and it gets under your skin. It is much more than just the story of a boy from point A to point B - with a tiger, although that is just as incredible. Despite the long first chapter, which in the end is worth it as it sets the mental state of the character, the book rolls along quickly - the ending is well worth it. As soon as I put it down I wanted to read it again, and that is a rare occurance. Highly recommended, read it with a few friends, and have a great meaningful discussion over a cup of coffee.
0446608955|5.0|The book, by far is amazingly better than compared to the movie made based on the book.  I had always been a reader, and I lost my love through reading over a three year period of time.  By reading this book, I gained the love back, so this book was definatly a conversion point for me.  Every young adult should pick a copy of this book to read it, to share what true love is about.  One of the best.
B00011RPB0|5.0|This DVD has a number of bonus goodies on it--including deleted scenes, a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola, Kevin Shield's &quot;City Girl&quot; video (the song plays behind clips of Scarlett Johansson walking through the city), and the obligatory trailer, but the real find here is Bob Smith's full appearance on &quot;Matthew's Big Hit TV,&quot; in which Smith (Bill Murray) cuts up with the eccentric &quot;Johnny Carson&quot; of Japan. <br />Unfortunately, the DVD is lacking a commentary (and Japanese subtitles would've added a charming touch), but it's well worth paying the price of this DVD to see Murray stick his hands in a box concealing live, slimy eels! Sit back with your Suntory and enjoy!
B00005BF9Z|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Mano Negra and Manu Chao and it's been interesting to see how the sound has evolved over the years. &quot;Clandestino&quot; is an immense solo album, and &quot;Proxima Estacion:Esperanza&quot;, while lacking some of the spiritual depth of the first effort, is still a great album exploring different themes. The whole CD sounds like a journey, and is a great CD to add to your road trip collection. Manu definitely takes a lighter approach mood-wise with this album compared to &quot;Clandestino&quot;, which is refreshing - otherwise we'd have &quot;Clandestino II&quot;. Still, the tracks are standouts in their own Manu way. &quot;Denia&quot; isn't full of Middle Eastern instruments, yet with the minimal vocals, Arabic calling, smooth guitar and steam whistles somehow I feel like I'm on a train in Morrocco anyway. &quot;Papito&quot; is nothing but silliness, and there's nothing wrong with that. Not every song has to be talking about the plight of the world for him to prove he's &quot;matured&quot; as an artist. He does take the musical background of &quot;Bongo Bong&quot; and instill it in a number of tracks here (&quot;Mr.Bobby&quot; &amp; &quot;Homens&quot;), and the music starting with &quot;La Primavera&quot; (a track that I prefer over the hit &quot;Me Gustas Tu&quot;) continues throughout the CD as well. There could have been a bit more originality there, but needless to say, there's some great laughs, some high energy, and some mellow moments, which makes this definitely one of the CDs that travels with me whenever I go anywhere. I wish I knew all 5 languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Arabic, English) that appeared on this album (I only know 3), but that doesn't take away from enjoying Manu at his zany best. Hope another one comes soon...
B000002IOW|5.0|I grew up during the 1980s - and so did Rush.  For most of the decade, Rush masqueraded as a singles band.  They turned out great songs like \\"Subdivisions,\\"  \\"Distant Early Warning,\\" and \\"Time Stand Still,\\" but failed to produce a record as solid as 1981's \\"Moving Pictures.\\" But \\"Presto,\\" released in 1989, blew me away with its maturity, skill, and overall brilliance.  Many Rush fans will disagree, but I strongly feel that (with the arguable exception of \\"Moving Pictures\\") \\"Presto\\" is their best album.<br />\\"Presto\\" derives its staying power from the maturing of Rush's songwriting skills, as well as their aggressive yet tasteful musicianship.  On this album, synthesizers provide atmospheric support, rather than dominating the mix (as they did for much of the 1980s). As a result, the trio's main instruments re-emerge - most obviously on the aggressive opening track, \\"Show Don't Tell,\\" but also on songs like \\"Scars\\" and \\"Superconductor.\\" Geddy Lee's transformation from shrieker to singer is complete, while Alex Lifeson seems reborn; his guitar playing is as inspired as it's been since \\"Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Moving Pictures.\\"<br />Neil Peart's lyrics reach a creative peak on \\"Presto.\\" No longer writing about computers, spaceships, or fantasy creatures, Peart tackles weightier topics such as suicide (\\"The Pass\\") and the environment (\\"Red Tide\\"). It's not all serious: you can imagine the fun he had devising the wordplay of \\"Anagram (for Mongo)\\" (take a close look at the lyrics on this one!) The motif of magic manifests itself in \\"Superconductor\\" and the title track, as well as on the album cover (the bunnies, in inflatable form, became a staple of Rush's live shows).<br />This is one of Rush's most diverse records. The sparse, atmospheric \\"The Pass\\" segues into the pounding intro of \\"War Paint,\\" while the funky, bass-driven \\"Scars\\" contrasts nicely with the strummed acoustic chords of the title track. \\"Superconductor\\" rocks authoritatively in 7/4 without sounding forcedor contrived.  A bold piano ostinato drives \\"Red Tide.\\"  The album closes with the subtle yet powerful \\"Available Light.\\"<br />Rupert Hine's production, controversial at the time, adds a slightly trebly gloss to the mix, providing a palpable and consistent sheen to the songs. The sonics aren't quite as bold and brilliant as on, say, \\"Grace Under Pressure,\\" but \\"Presto's\\" overall sound has aged better than the muddy \\"Signals\\" or the heavily produced \\"Hold Your Fire.\\"<br />Rush perfected their craft with \\"Presto,\\" without rehashing the sound of any of their previous works.  Fifteen years later, it remains musically and thematically relevant. Don't miss this one - it's a masterpiece!
0566080389|5.0|Goldratt has done many valuable things for the practice of Industrial Engineering and Operations Management. To fully appreciate what he is doing, one really should have a background in mathematical programming, but what he has done for project management is truly valuable. He is very intentional in his writing style, and fortunately for the layperson, he leaves the linear programming formulation of what he's describing out of things.<br />It is true that Goldratt's ideas could be stated in twenty pages or so, but he is very wise and intentional in not giving away the answers. None of my professors at Berkeley would give out answers when it is better for students to learn things on their own.<br />At least one of the Goldratt books is tremendously helpful reading before starting the graduate programs in transportation engineering. It presents in a very intuitive way what Carlos Daganzo, Gordon Newell, Adolf May, and other big names in traffic flow theory have explained so explicitly in precise mathematical form. The five step focusing process is very useful in the evaluation of cyclic servers and bottlenecks, the statistical process control techniques are necessary to keep projects, plants, and transit operations on schedule, and the evaporating clouds are tremendously helpful in solving planning problems of conflicts between the environment and improving transportation system performancs, etc.<br />Goldratt's work is so much more valuable than optimization techniques alone could ever be. Goldratt helps spot what is and is not a valid optimization problem. It ingrains the basic results of optimization in the reader's mind, so it can be applied quickly and intuitively. All the benefits of the simplex algorithm with none of the mathematical formulations.<br />And yes, a lot of business school curricula are full of it.<br />Mark McDonald<BR>MS/PhD Candidate<BR>University of California, Berkeley

0790730960|4.0|Batman Returns continues to follow the dark vision of director Tim Burton's classic Batman. The production team improves on the dark moody visuals of the previous film by setting it during winter. Here the stark white snow creates a powerful contrast to the bleak gothic images of Gotham at night. However the in an attempt to outdo the previous Bat film, the producers begin the disturbing trend of pushing style over substance that would eventually lead to the end of the Batman franchise Thankfully, Burton manages to overcome this obstacle and maintains a high level of quality throughout this solid sequel.<br />Michael Keaton gives another great-understated performance as both Batman and Bruce. In BR, Keaton shows us how comfortable he's become playing the role of Batman; he blends parts of his own personality into both Batman and Bruce making the characters his own. Michelle Pfeiffer gives a great performance as Selina Kyle and her alter ego Catwoman. She shows tremendous acting range seamlessly transitioning from the mousy Selina Kyle to the feral, twisted Catwoman. While wearing the pale white make up and black costume Pfeiffer becomes another person altogether. Her chemistry with Keaton and onscreen intensity keep the film from collapsing in the final act. Danny Devito is great as the Penguin and Christopher Walken steals the show as the real villain of the piece as the evil Businessman Max Schreck. With Tim Burton's help these talented actors fend off the offscreen villain who would eventually defeat the franchise: Warner Bros Management.<br />Batman Returns has a great story; however it is lost in all the stunts and special effects tossed at the viewer. While an evil circus gang is terrorizing Gotham, Businessman Max Schreck is planning on building a power plant in Gotham city However, he can't get support from the mayor and Bruce Wayne who know there is no need for a power plant. Schreck attempts to gain the political power he needs to get the plant built by holding a recall election. Schreck recruits Oswald Cobblepot to run for mayor using pity for the misshapen penguin man to garner support for his candidate. However, Batman is aware of Schreck's scheme and he also knows that Cobblepot is the leader of the circus gang which has been terrorizing Gotham city. Also aware of Schreck's evil scheme is his shy secretary Selina Kyle. After Schreck pushes Kyle out of a window she snaps and becomes the mysterious Catwoman who seeks revenge on Schreck for destroying her life. To keep batman from revealing the secrets, Schreck and Cobblepot begin a campaign to discredit batman's credibility as the guardian of Gotham city by framing him for the murder of the Ice princess. Batman proves his innocence, however the story gets confusing after that. After his child-kidnapping plot is foiled, Penguin's attempt to destroy Gotham city with penguins wearing missiles. The climax where batman foils Penguin doesn't mesh together and the finale is disappointing with the exception of the scenes where Batman helps Catwoman's personality struggles with Selina's for dominance. Here Keaton, Pfeiffer and Walken save the film from collapse by overcoming the weak parts of the script with great acting.<br /> For Comics fans: Selina did not die; the awnings and the snowdrift broke her fall. The cats who revived her and the Cheshire cat mascot of the Schreck's store are what led to create the Catwoman personality. Selina spends most of the movie fighting not only Schreck, but also the \\"Catwoman\\" personality inside her for control.<br /> All of these stories are hard to follow because just as you start to understand the plot here comes another stunt or visual effect to distract you. The campy stunts make it hard to find the substance of the story. It took multiple viewings for me to catch these plot points; If not for Tim Burton's focus they would have been ignored completely. I highly recommend this film but I also suggest that you stop buying batman filmsfrom here. Without Burton and Keaton around this whole franchise falls completely apart.here.

0790731002|2.0|It is clear to me why Tim Burton and Michael Keaton left the Bat franchise after Batman Returns. The constant interference of WB executives over creative decisions kept that film from being its best. Even though both were offered large amounts of money (Keaton was offered $33 million to retake the part) they both wisely declined the project to maintain their artistic integrity. WB then soon found someone who would compromise himself artistcally to give WB its vison of Batman: \\"Car Wash\\" director Joel Schumacher.<br />Batman forever is clearly the brainchild of WB executives and Director Joel Schumacher is only here to be a yes man that will give WB management exactly what they want: Camp, comedy, and over the top stunts. With their shill in place WB management began their wholesale demoliton of the Batman Franchise. Dark gothic visuals give way to bright neon lights reminiscent of Las Vegas. Batman goes from dark and mysterious to someone reminiscent of Adam West. Villains go from dark twisted psychopaths to cartoonish goofballs. A batmobile that lights up and we get Robin the 25-year-old boy wonder. And crotch shots. Lots and lots of crotch shots.<br />Val Kilmer's good performance is hampered by Akiva Goldsman's campy script. He does not deserve the unprofessional rap he earned while working on this film; Instead Kilmer should be commended for trying to maintain the artistic integrity of the Batman character; he does his best to make the character dark and menacing in the Saturday Morning cartoon envioronment he's thrown into. Kilmer was said to be clearly upset with the campy direction the film was taking and his frustration shows in some of his facial expressions as Bruce Wayne. He clearly thought he would be playing a dark brooding Batman, not some Adam West type buffoon. His anger at Schumacher's direction is justified, however it prevents him from seamlessly blending into the role the way Keaton did.<br />The supporting cast is not as strong this time. Sadly high priced stars replace high quality actors in BF. I missed the serious understated strong performances of screen veterans like Billy Dee Williams, Robert Wuhl, Christopher Walken and Jack Palance in the previous Burton films. Tommy Lee Jones is terribly miscast as Two-Face; the cartoonish way he portrays the character is reminiscent of the Joker instead of the tormented former Prosecutor turned criminal the character is supposed to be. Jim Carrey is way too over the top as the Riddler. The Riddler character in the comics has a manic exterior peresonality that hides his calculating arrogant interior personality; Carrey puts no dimension to the role and plays the Riddler like Ace Ventura on crack. Chris O'Donnell is awful as Dick Grayson and Robin.He doesn't even try to make either role work, he doesn't even try to act here. Nicole Kidman has nothing to work but her assets as the love interest. Debi Mazar and Drew Barrymore are just wasted as two face's henchwomen Sugar ad Spike. Most, especially O'Donnell regret getting involved with this career killing franchise.<br />The convoluted plot is nonexistent and is only used to move us from one big stunt to the next or the next visual effect to the next The Riddler creates a device that allows viewers to see TV in 3d but it also drains their brains into his. That makes sense to you? It didn't to me. Obsessed with Bruce Wayne (homosexual overtones abound) he seeks to find out the identity of the batman. Taking Two-face along for the ride they go on more car chases and blow up stuff good in a quest to find out the secret. Along the way Two-Face kills the Grayson family so that O'Donnell has some reason to become Robin and stay relevant in the film. The final battle is ridiculous and only for those with short attention spans.<br />When I was younger (23) I thought this movie was OK. Now that I'm older (30) and can distinct great movies from and good movies from bad ones I've grown to loathe this movie with the greatest contempt. It insults the source material and its creator Bob Kane. It makes a mockery of what Batman really is: A dark mysterious urban legend that protects terrified citizens from themselves. Here our hero is transformed into a commercial shill for the WB to sell merchandise. If Schumacher had the time he probably would have had Robin drive the batmobile down to the \\"Car Wash\\" So that the smiling Negro crew from his first film could give Batman's ride a wash and wax. But those were probably deleted scenses that will be available in the special editon. Avoid at alll costs.It insults the source material and its creator Bob Kane.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|good movie, that's worth seeing but with what i thought were odd problems -- ok, just odd for me.<br />the movie centers around Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a hollywood actor now past his prime who finds himself in Japan doing a whisky commercial for easy money. <br />arriving in Tokyo, he is jetlagged and blinks at the high tech pulse of city (reminded me a bit of Blade Runner with the electronic ads) and the very surface problem of verbal translation as his horrendously bad translator relays dialogue between him and the director of the commmerical.<br />finding some refuge in the nightclub/lounge in his posh hotel, he catches the eye of Charlotte (Scarlett Johanson), a newlywed to a photographer on assignment in Japan. she feels displaced because her husband is never around and there is no emotional anchor that ties her to Tokyo; her plea to her friend at the start of the movie describing going to a shrine and feeling nothing quickly establishes her disassociation.<br />Bob and Charlotte quickly develop an affinity for each other that goes beyond being Americans in Japan... but more likely that they are both adrift in their relationships -- the term soulmates comes to mind.<br />i am reminded of moments of my own trip to Japan three years ago, many of the familiar places, the kinship felt among visitors to a foreign land and other foreign tourists... but there are things that definitely is jarring and seem implausible. <br />how Charlotte (who doesn't work and is a 'sophisticate') can afford a posh hotel on an assignment photographer is beyond me. the day trips to Kyoto and wherever Bob teed off are unlikely -- Kyoto isn't all that easy to navigate and you lose over four hours just sitting on the shinkansen; meanwhile Mt. Fuji is barely visible from Tokyo so you do the math. neither Bob nor Charlotte spoke Japanese, which becomes an issue outside of Tokyo proper. two side trips that really didn't serve the movie in a meaningful way and seemed like orphaned scenes.<br/>i know many viewers feel this movie rings true to being a tourist -- simply put being concious of being foreign. i agree and gave this movie three stars but i felt that the overall issue of cultural displacement, the path of the movie and the dialogue were all done in a more effective way in the movie Barcelona.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|O.K, I read all the reviews and bought it anyway. Bad choice !  The sound IS BAD, and I mean BAD.  The mix sounds like one mic for the band, and several hundred for the crowd.  I have many LIVE concerts (tape,DVD,etc.)but this one rates at the bottom.  I'm sure the boys sound great but you can't tell...  Exit Stage Left, done over 20 yrs ago, blows this one away for sound quality.  If you want crowd noise go to an NFL game, or buy this DVD.  It's about the same.  As a RUSH fan of over 20 years, what a let down.
B00002E233|3.0|I saw this on PPV, and it was....okay. I had been waiting for a shark movie, and as far as campy shark movies, this one isn't too bad....but it's not very good either. It's the kind of cheese that's fun to watch once or twice, while kicking back with a couple of beers (believe me, the beers help).<BR>   Basic storyline, sharks have been modified in the name of scientific research on alhstheimers (spelling?). Something about sharks being somehow fit for this type of research. Anyway, in the process, the sharks have become &quot;Super-geniuses&quot; and the *&amp;^% hits the fan. Everybody but a handful of people go away for a weekend and hilarity ensues.<BR>     Honestly, I found myself rooting for the sharks. They were only trying to escape from the research facility/shark prison. Sadly, they were eventually defeated, but they did snack on a bunch of people. Made me pretty happy. <BR>     The dialoge was corny of course, but no more so than your typical sitcom.<BR>    A fun watch, but don't see it if you want something serious.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I believe my title really sums up my opinions on this record, but since that doesn't offer much detail, it's probably a good idea for me to elaborate a bit.<br />This album is the most beautiful thing ever put to wax.  Plain and simple.  The music is long (songs range from 7-10 minutes), complex, and beautifully orchestrated.  The band utilises an awe-inspiring string section that never fails to touch.  Listening to tracks 3 and 4 remove all doubt about this claim.  Singer Jonsi's falsetto, Icelandic vocals are easily the strangest to ever emit from a human being and float over each song beautifully, used more as another instrument than anything else.  Most of the songs on this album are sung in Icelandic, a very beautiful language indeed, while some songs are sung in &quot;Hopelandic&quot;, a made-up &quot;language&quot; comprised of about 12 syllables.  While this may be a bit silly, the band's sound totally makes up for anything that one might see as stupid.<br />While this band has often been compared to Godspeed you black emporer, Mogwai, and other &quot;post-rock&quot; acts, Sigur Ros really sounds like no one else.  They are totally unique and stunningly original.  It will take the listener a bit of time to fully realize and get into this music, but if you're patient and take time to listen to this album, you will be richly rewarded in the future.  That is a guarantee and a promise.<br />&quot;Children will be conceived, wrists will be slashed, scars will be healed, and tears will be wrenched by this group.  They are the first vital band of the 21st Century.&quot;-Brent DiCrescenzo
B0000C83YJ|5.0|Put aside all those stories about Boy George and drummer Jon Moss and Boy George's drug collapse and just listen to this album.  It is nearly perfect and is one of the best albums to come out of the 1980s.  Considering that their smash debut album had three songs in a row with the word &quot;Boy&quot; in the title, Colour By Numbers is a surprisingly mature-sounding album.  &quot;Victims&quot; (a single in the UK) is an interesting and beautiful ballad.  The rest are amazing pop tracks.  So many of these songs were released as singles (&quot;Karma Chameleon,&quot; &quot;It's A Miracle,&quot; &quot;Church of the Poison Mind,&quot; &quot;Miss Me Blind,&quot; &quot;Victims,&quot; and even &quot;Black Money&quot; was considered for release off the &quot;This Time&quot; hits set) it can almost be considered a greatest hits package in and of itself.  All it needs is &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me,&quot; Culture Club's best song &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart)&quot; and maybe &quot;I'll Tumble 4 Ya&quot; and there you go.  In fact, the weakest track here is probably the most famous one: &quot;Karma Chameleon.&quot;  In his autobiography, Boy George writes how guitarist Roy Hay hated this track and, due to a bet, married his girlfriend when the single reached #1.  Things went downhill for the band after this album but Colour By Numbers made Culture Club one of the most important bands of the 1980s. P.S. The bonus tracks are also quality material.  The title track is pleasant and Helen Terry really kicks some major fanny on &quot;Man Shake.&quot;

0679882820|5.0|This little board book is so much fun -- my three month old is mesmerized by it.  It's appropriately subtitled as \\"Dr. Seuss's Book of Wonderful Noises\\" -- and it certainly runs through the range of noises.  This book goes beyond the introductory cows go moo into a much broader range of sounds -- bees buzzing, corks popping, horses klopping, rain dibble dibble dopping.  There is also reference to a soft whisper, so the reader can use a range of dynamics.  The illustrations are classic Seuss - Mr. Brown is an odd little fellow with a tall brown hat, a spriggly mustache under his nose, and a haughty chin-in-the-air demeanor.  The animals range from the semi-realistic to floppy-footed bizarre.  Overall, this book is a delight that should keep any little one entertained for a few minutes.
B000002KET|4.0|This album cover, unfortunately, is probably responsible for all the Venom, Slayer, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond Satanic dreck on their album covers.  In fact, when I was a kid, my mother wouldn't even let me own it because of the cover!  Even today, as a Christian, I'm not crazy about the front cover, but I take it in context with the back cover as kind of a &quot;nightmare/dream&quot; concept.  At one time I even owned the LP version of this that had the band members as like transparent spirits (it looked like they were nude!) in a bedroom of an old English manor house in the gatefold.  The CD doesn't have this.<br />There are some who rate this album as Black Sabbath's finest.  Myself, I see it as the beginning of the end of the Ozzy Osbourne years.  It should be remembered that, during the writing of this album, Tony Iommi suffered severe writer's block, and despite the opinions of those &quot;Ozzy-IS-Sabbath&quot; zealots, Iommi was the well from which this band's music was drawn.  Also, when you see the &quot;Produced by Black Sabbath,&quot; it really means &quot;Produced by Tony Iommi,&quot; as he was heavily involved in the production of the final Ozzy years albums (the vocalist often butting heads with the guitarist over Tony's desire to experiment).<br />Thankfully, he managed to overcome the writer's block and came up with what is probably the most experimental Black Sabbath album.  This is an &quot;everything-AND-the-kitchen-sink&quot; album, admittedly not their strongest song-wise, but a lot of fun in headphones!<br />It's widely known that Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman appears on this album, though he's not on every cut and he's uncredited.<br />Requisite objection: Ozzy is not my favourite singer, though he sings here as well as on anything he's done, I suppose.  However, Geezer Butler's lyrics are probably more obtuse here than on any Sabbath album before or since.  He's said he &quot;got very contemplative on certain substances,&quot; and there's plenty of evidence for that here as I haven't any idea what several of the songs are saying lyrically.  Unfortunately, from &quot;Vol. 4&quot; through &quot;Never Say Die,&quot; his bass is often mixed too low - a shame for one of rock's best bass players.<br />&quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&quot; - Definitely the heaviest cut, with some jazzy Iommi acoustic interludes and a ripping solo from the lefty maestro.  Drips with attitude, too.  Ozzy gets fully stuck in to the vocal on this one.  I saw them perform it live in 1994 with Tony Martin on vocals and it was even better.<br />&quot;A National Acrobat&quot; - Obtuse lyrics, but with some nice Iommi melodic guitar fills.<br />&quot;Fluff&quot; - An entirely Iommi instrumental creation of guitar and piano orchestration.  He overdubs several levels of acoustic and electric guitars, combined with piano, to produce an almost &quot;music-box&quot; effect.  The band used this as their recorded &quot;outro&quot; during the Dio years.<br />&quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; - Almost poppy, with the kind of &quot;I love my girl&quot; lyrics that Sabbath had notably stayed away from.  Title doesn't fit the song at all, kind of like &quot;N.I.B.&quot;<br />&quot;Killing Yourself To Live&quot; - Probably directed at the tour/record/tour/record cycle that was burning the band out at this time.  There's a cool section in the middle where Ozzy's voice follows Iommi's guitar lines.  For some reason he also almost-whispers a paean to weed: &quot;Smoke it - get high!&quot; that hasn't anything to do with the rest of the song.<br />&quot;Who Are You?&quot; - This is probably the goofiest song on the album.  I've read that this is indeed an almost-entirely-Ozzy composition, that he came up with whilst doing one-finger messing about on a synthesiser and the lyrics are his as well.  I wonder if he's addressing God or Satan in these lyrics?  Ends with some nice Wakeman orchestration, supported by fine percussion from Bill Ward (indeed, some of Ward'sbest drumming is found in several places on this album).<br />&quot;Looking For Today&quot; - Again, almost poppy, complete with handclaps.  Tony also plays flute on here, as he did on &quot;Solitude&quot; from &quot;Master of Reality&quot; and for sound effects on &quot;Born Again.&quot;<br />&quot;Spiral Architect&quot; - They had to learn this song for their Ozzy reunion tour, as I gather they'd not played it live before.  This is another lyrically-strange song, with Geezer contemplating on how God decides which sperm gets through to which egg.  Strange drugs, Geez.  I can't figure out if it's actually strings or some of Rick Wakeman's over-the-top keyboards toward the end (along with some dubbed-in applause).<br />Overall, a good-but-not-their-best album.  The intent to experiment is admirable but kind of leads this album all over the map with some tracks not really going nowhere.
B000000WHH|5.0|Colour By Numbers is Culture Club's best album, but buy the remastered version as it has many bonus tracks including, among others, the song from where this album got its name and a Helen Terry fanny-kicking on B-side &quot;Man Shake.&quot;  Now, here is the reason this album is one of the best of the 1980s and definitely the best by Culture Club: Put aside all those stories about Boy George and drummer Jon Moss and Boy George's drug collapse and just listen to this album.

B0001AVZA8|1.0|Sadly, another vacant vehicle for Keaton.  I expected a romantic comedy with wit, humor, repartee.  Instead I got one more boring love story, which, when it lagged unbearably, was propped up with Nicholson's visits to the ER.  How does a supposedly mature woman who seems cool and says good-bye to her lover with no apparent expectations turn into an infant in public at a restaurant upon seeing him with someone else, cause a scene, and leave without her belongings and without even informing her dining party that she is leaving?  How does she then weep and wail like a three-year-old until she exploits the dim relationship by writing a play about it?  And that leering scene on the beach, along with other immature mannerisms--please, enough.  Maybe the leering was okay twenty or thirty years ago, but in a supposedly mature woman pushing age sixty it is no longer cute.  However, the performance of Keaton's counterpart complements hers in that Jack Nicholson is wooden throughout this film.  His acting here consists of running commentary, mostly monosyllabic, on Keaton's antics, and, clearly, he is along only to prop up Keaton in a dismal plot.  Finally, at the end, when Keaton and Nicholson are re-united in Paris, is it because she has the maturity to know her own mind and heart?  Or the courage to speak up?  No, but, rather, her young whippersnapper doctor-lover has to do it all for her because she does not have the required maturity to care for her emotional self. If this indicates, as her daughter says, \\"the gene I never got,\\" the daughter is lucky indeed.  I was deeply disappointed in this movie and am reminded of a cartoon in a humor book of my mom's from way back when.  A milque-toast man is standing outside a theater in the box-office lobby area.  He is holding a black marker crayon. Beside him is a poster touting a film:  \\"'Wonderful' says the NEWS! 'Stupendous' says the Weekly!  'MUST SEE' says the Times!\\"  Beneath those comments is written, obviously by Mr. M-T,\\"'Phooey!' says Elmer Tweep.\\"  Well, I join Elmer Tweep with respect to \\"Something's Gotta Give\\"--phooey, I say!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Well, RICO, I guess you used spellcheck on your last entry.  Actually, however, &quot;no&quot; I don't get your point.  I certainly don't get the point that &quot;Madonna rules&quot;.  Maybe she rules you and all her other lambs--but not those of us who know better!
B00006IU73|5.0|This album is great, just great.<br />It starts off powerfully with Blackest Eyes, which definately has a metal feel to it. Which is a great song.<br />The quality keeps up all the way until the end, this album just blew me away when i heard it. But not the first time, as all great albums do, this album blew me away the second listen. You sink into this album, its upbeat, which is not totally me. But its great. I reccomend this to anyone who likes progressive music.
B000000W5L|5.0|\\"Exile on Main Street\\" was, and is the pinnacle of the Rolling Stones' storied career.  Their preceding albums point toward it, while the albums that followed, with a few exceptions, chronicle a gradual but inevitable decline.  The Stones' love of R&B and their driving Rock and Roll mojo all collide here into one muddy, magnificent and transcendent work that is as important to the genre as any of the early R&B masters.  Sadly, the Rolling Stones would never reach such a dizzying peak again. With \\"Exile on Main Street\\", however, they  were, if only for a moment, the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band.
0920668372|5.0|Cynics, sickos and general crumudgeons, this book is written through the eyes of CHILDREN and recommended for 4-8 year olds.  Would you rather the author show the son in the back of a cruiser after under age drinking at a party and while he is passed out in his bed after his Mom bails him out of jail she could crawl into his room to recite the poem-that would be fun to explain to a 5 year old!<br />As one reviewer put it, you could just tell your children you love them...think of that page turner.  Once Upon a Time, I love You, The End.  Oh, Mommy, please read that one again!<br />Where's the baby's Mother?  The son's Father? Who knows?  Who Cares!!!  My children have never once asked me and I never once cared.  Please don't ask the \\"Normal Well-Adjusted Mother\\" reviewer.  I am sure it will have to do with serial-killer's or cannibles and other non-age appropriate material for a CHILDREN'S BOOK!!!<br />This is a WONDERFUL book.  Sorry, but if you find it icky, creepy, or anything other than innocent pleasure to read take the money you would spend on other book's and spend it on therapy.
B00005JKZV|1.0|Why in the world this film is SOOOOO revered is well beyond my capacity.  Too Long.  Too much bad CG.  Too much running from annoying non-plot driving &quot;threats&quot;.  Villians that ain't scary and a slow motion death scene the like of which havent been seen since B rated schlock.  You people can have have your sad devotion to a trilogy of films that have more flaws than 10 Star Wars prequels.  It is a sad day for cinema...I am only staying anonymous to avoid a hundred thousand virgins emailing hate towards me.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The film: it's got some good moments. It does, however, seem like the middle of the film has been ripped out.  Somehow Murray and Johannsen go from intrigued acquaintances to soul mates, but I, for one, missed the transition.  The film is visually very nice with a lot of lingering, hallucinatory views of Tokyo (and a bit of Kyoto too).  The shot where Murray's character tees off on the golf course is magnificent.  The karaoki sequence is a particularly insightful piece of direction (and maybe this is what Coppolla used in place of the film having a middle) -- the characters bond through singing popular songs that also have their own inscrutable meaning to them.  There is so much in their choice of songs, how they sing them, how the evening came together.  For that scene alone, the film is worthwhile.<br />But the DVD?  Horrible.  But more than horrible: offensive.  The reason?  Universal has seen fit to force viewers to sit through minute after minute of advertising at the top of the DVD.  Don't try your menu key, don't try your stop key, don't try your skip key, because none of them will work.  There is no way to skip this garbage.  If Universal wants to put out DVDs like this, then let them discount them in return for forcing their advertising on home viewers.  In any event, I'm not sure what they accomplish, since most viewers will be so angry at Universal's heavy handed, condescending approach that they'll instantly put a black mark against any film whose trailer they're forced to watch.  Shame on you, Universal.
0451191153|5.0|What's so amazing about this book--aside from the excellent writing, great characters, and wonderful plot--is that it's still around and going strong.  I initially read this book in college and it kept me up at night.  Along with &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; it changed my life and initially not for the better.  But after the dust settled I was better off.  It was the first book that really got me to think about things--this book of &quot;ideas,&quot; and while my emotional and psychological pendulum swung too far in the opposite direction I had been at, I was, in the end, better off.  Talk about your eye-opener!  And that's what is so amazing about this book--the power it has to change people.  How many other books do you know that can do that?  This is a classic, a must read for anyone interested in great and serious literature.<br />Also recommended:  McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood, Atlas Shrugged, and East of Eden
B0000DD7LB|2.0|This CD has only one good song on it. &quot;Toxic.&quot;  That's it.  Everything else it sort of crappy.  Some of the stuff she sings about are just stupid.  The music to the songs is great though, and her voice sounds better.  I only got this CD for dancing to it.  That's all it's good for, beats.
B000003TA4|5.0|Okay, nowadays everyone says any top-selling album is an &quot;essential&quot; CD. But when you have owned a masterpiece like this one for 13 years of your life, listen to it on a regular basis and NEVER, EVER get sick of hearing the same songs...that's essential. I could never do this album justice by putting into words how good this album is. Nevermind is a ground-breaking album, that really put Nirvana on the map. Personally, I think that this album edges out In Utero by a microscopic amount. But this is the more essential of the two, with their most famous song &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; kicking the album off.<BR>All of the songs are rated 5 out of 5, except maybe Territorial Pissings which lacked just a little more.<br />But all in all, this is the album that inspired all of today's rockers that everyone loves. If you don't own this, you're really missing out. Trust me. In all honesty, when was the last time you heard knocking this CD???
B000002UJQ|5.0|One of the best albums of all time, accept it people!
B00006LLNU|5.0|With Sigur Ros, its all about the music, the mood, and the soundscape they create.  Whether the lyrics really mean something in Iceland or they're just mush-mouth jibberish, it doesn't really matter.<br />With (), the volume has decreased, yet their peculiarity has intensified.  This release is less trippy but equally as stunning, enticing, soothing and hypnotizing.  This music is inspiring...
B0000CDL93|5.0|Sorry about the re-write of my review of this film and DVD --- but this is the last revision. Let me start off by saying that I'm not much on film critics. I'm certainly not trying to be one by coming on here and giving my two-cents. However, I do read Roger Ebert's movie reviews, and I try to choose some of the movies from his favorites. Now, most of the time, this never works. But in the case of Oliver Stone's JFK, I agree 100%. It is one of the best films of the 1990's. There I said it. Onto the movie. The movie's screenplay is really written from two books. One entitled 'Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy' (by Jim Marrs) and the other 'On the Trail of the Assassins' (by Jim Garrison). Now to say that this is 100% factual is crazy, but the simple fact of the matter is that we DO NOT know exactly who killed Kennedy (I believe Oswald was involved, but at a lower level) and the facts are that Oswald was shooting from behind the President and if you've watched the Abraham Zapruder film you'll see Kennedy's head go back when the fatal head-shot hit him. Now COMMON SENSE PEOPLE if you're shooting from behind, the impact from the bullet is going to send your head forward --- NOT BACKWARDS. I've just got a High School Diploma and I got enough sense to know that. To say that were NOT a conspiracy is just plain crazy. Four bullets accounted for --- only one riffle --- the only way this assassignation was done was with the help of at least one other person! COMMON SENSE AGAIN! It aggervates me that some people are still living in their fantasy world and don't want to face the truth, but I thinks it's vital for our country to know what really happened --- WE OWE IT TO JOHN KENNEDY. Back to the film, I think Oliver Stone captures exactly how America feels about this subject, even today --- that we're still saddened and some still mourning over the loss of a President who (if lived and served two terms as President) would've gotten out soldiers out of Vietnam about a decade earlier and imagine all the lives that would still be in this world. Any time I'm sitting around watching a war film on the Vietnam War, I feel the pain of those who have lost their loved ones. Oliver Stone ensembles an amazing cast headlined by Kevin Costner and his co-stars include -- Tommy Lee Jones, Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Jack Lemon, Walter Matthau, Vincent D'Onofrio, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight, Laurie Metcalf and Jay O. Sanders. Onto the DVD --- If you own the 'Oliver Stone Collection' Director's Cut of this movie, DO NOT buy this copy. It's the exact same material including the commentary track! If you haven't bought a copy of JFK on DVD then I'd pick it up. The commentary track alone is worth the extra cash. Not to mention the Deleted/Alternate Scenes and the Documentary With &quot;X&quot;. The Director's Cut contains 17 minutes of un-seen footage, as well. This is a must! I don't want to ruin it for JFK fans, but if you haven't seen the Director's Cut, then I suggest you do so now! Awsome scene where Garrison is met at the Airport and --- well, you'll just have to pick up a copy of this to see. The DVD transfer is excellent as well as the sound (you don't have to hold on to the remote and wait for one scene to out-power the next --- sound-wise). One of the most provocative, mind-bending films ever released, this film will make you beg for more!
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead has been a hard band to describe. They did post grunge with their first album, spacy pop on their 2nd, and did a complete change of styles on OK Computer. On Kid A, they competly changed their style again to create one of the best albums ever made. Every song is brilliant. The title track sounds like a lullaby arranged by Aphex Twin, National Anthem is a drum-and-bass instrumental that just goes crazy at the end, Idioteque is a weird trance song, Treefingers is a beatiful song with no real melody at all, and of course, Motion Picture Soundtrack, perhaps the saddest song Radiohead ever did. <br />Of course, people are going to say that it isn't original, and that it broke no ground at all. But I still give credit for Radiohead to change their style altogether. Good album.
B000001FY9|5.0|This CD features all of Bob Marley's best known songs.  This is classic stuff.  If you are new to reggae, this is the first album you should get.  Then, if you like it (and I don't see why you wouldn't), you can delve further into the Bob Marley catalogue.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Track 6 alone almost makes me ruin my best trousers.<br />Beautifully wierd music.  Angelic trip-hop??<br />You don't know what to think at first listen, but you know it is something special.<br />Catch a buzz, then catch this CD!
B00007ELF2|5.0|I had went to theaters to see this movie. Mainly because the previews said it was a knockout, brilliant, and in every critics top 10 list. I was a little skeptical at first, but once it starts it pulls you in. From begining to end, this film lacks nothing. The film interweaves three stories three stories with one basic link --- drugs. There's two undercover cops (Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle) who bust a dope peddler (Miguel Ferrer) who rats out his supplier (Steven Bauer) --- whose pampered housewife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) learns of her husbands dirty business. Then there is a newly-appointed Drug Czar (Michael Douglas) who is fighting the drug trafficking very well, but is failing with his increasingly drug-addicted daughter (Erika Christensen). On the Mexican drug-side, we have a cop (Academy Award Winner Benecio Del Torro) trying to clean up the streets, but on the other hand trying to help a crooked General (Tomas Milian) that he doesn't know he's helping. This film is really the definitive drug-film. Unlike most, which either deals with addiction (Requiem For A Dream) or the trafficking side (Scarface), this film succeeds in both area's. Academy Award winning director Steven Soderberg knocks this one out of the ball-park. Like most GREAT directors, you can tell when a director is going to be great --- great acting comes from good directing. The cinematography is outstanding. The Mexico scenes have a rich, but gritty feel to them. The Washington scenes are very dim, very dull. The San Deigo scenes are rich in color and have almost a blinding feel to it. All masterfully done. Benecio Del Torro really stole the show, successfully grabbing his first Oscar. I'm sure it won't be the last. He's also up for 'Best Supporting Actor' for his powerful performance as a born-again Christian in the hit film &quot;21 Grams&quot; (also a great film). For a great film, filled with magnificent performances and brilliant camera-work and directing, don't miss out on &quot;Traffic&quot;.
079284131X|2.0|When I was a 9 years old kid, this movie really scared me. Not because of the concept of a killer doll, but because the idea of using black magic to transport a human soul into a cute doll is quite disturbing. I thought this movie was one of the best horror films ever made. Plus, Chucky is a very charismatic dude, so I liked this movie a lot.<br />13 years later, and many movies later, I realized that even if the concept sounds great on paper, \\"Child's Play\\" is a flawed movie. <br />After seen this movie about 10 times since I was a kid, I discover 6 basic rules you should know about Chucky:<br />1).- CHUCKY WILL OVERPOWER YOU: Even if you weight 30 times more than him, he is capable of knock you down with his hands, he can throw you from a window, he can beat you with a baseball bat or a hammer, he can choke you to death with his tiny, soft hand, he doesn't even need two hands, with only one hand he will finish your life.<br />2).- CHUCKY HAS SHARP TEETHES: his rubber teethes are so strong that his bite is worst than the bite of a rabid dog. He will provoke you a deep wound on your arm.<br />3).- CHUCKY CAN TALK: even if Chucky doesn't have vocal chords, he can talk, he can scream, he can recite voodoo spells, he can pack the sky with dark clouds and frightening lightnings while he transfers his soul into your body.<br />4).- CHUCKY IS FAST: No matter how fast you can run, he will outrun you with his short, soft legs. Also he can reach the top of a building in less than a minute, and he will sneak into your apartment to kill you.<br />5).- CHUCKY CAN OPEN DOORS: Chucky is short, but he still is able of reaching high locks, high windows, high elevator controls. Also he can sneak into your car, even if you lock the door.<br />6).- CHUCKY CAN BLEED: As time goes by, Chucky becomes more and more human, he can feel the pain, he can bleed, but the only way to kill him is if you shoot him exactly in the center of his heart. It doesn't matter if you chop his head, cut hisarms and legs, or if you burn his entire body, he will come back until you destroy his human heart.<br />BONUS: Hide your female dolls, because Chucky could leave your doll pregnant, and his evil, plastic son will attack you with his sharp teethes.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Well, another comic book movie comes to the screen and falls short of hopes and expectations! The movie has great possibilities, but fails to tell a good story within fairly decent action. Charecters like Lucian were brought to life, while Kraven was done over the top and poorly to say the least by Shane Brolly! All and all I do hope for the next movie and hope for better then the 2.5 stars I would rate this one! NEXT!
B00013PHGS|5.0|I just listened to Talkie Walkie and it is utterly amazing. In my opinion, 10,000 Hz Legend was one of the greatest albums of all time. This album has a different feel to it in many respects from both Moon Safari and 10,000 Hz Legend. But it still seems to open your mind up and let it travel new places, like a door to another dimension. Absoutely gorgeous and fascinating. Air deserve the nobel prize. Stephen Cox
0790729725|5.0|Goodfellas is, (in my opinion), one of the definitive films of the genre (exception of &quot;The Godfather,&quot; &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; and Martin Scorsese's most under-rated films &quot;Casino&quot;) and one of Scorsese's masterpieces. The film is shown through the eyes of teenager Henry Hill. Like his opening words &quot;I always dreamed of being a gangster. Even as a little kid, I dreamed of it. To me being a gangster was better than being the President of the United States&quot; the film starts out as a uncompromising look into the Mafia. Then Scorsese cuts to Henry about ten years later. He's grown into a successful mobster. We see one of Henry's best pal's Tommy. He's a gangster that scares most other gangsters. Along with Tommy is the excellent Robert Deniro playing one of Henry's mentors Jimmy Conway. A lifetime gangster, whose as lethal as a bullet. The way Scorsese tells the story is absolutely amazing. It's power not only lies in Scorsese's directing, but in the performance from Academy Award-Winner Joe Pesci. His performance still gives me bad jolts watching the film (which originally came out in 1990) even with friends. An amazing film, worthy of facing up against monumental films as &quot;Scarface&quot; and &quot;The Godfather.&quot; The only problem with this excellent film is the treatment they game the DVD. The sound is fairly crisp, but the picture quality is that of a VHS tape that has been rented out on too many times. The other problem I have with the DVD (and this is the truth) is that it is single-layered. Everytime I watch the DVD it ticks me off, because you have to flip the disk about two-thirds through the film. Now if they can fit &quot;The Godfather&quot; (which is about 3 hours and a few minutes) on one disk, then what's the problem with this picture? Terrible DVD, with little special features (a theatrical trailer and cast bios) that are worth nothing.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|You will NEVER forget this movie. As he proved in Mystic River, Sean Penn is an amazing actor and this movie wouldn't be the same without him. I think he should have gotten an Oscar for his performance in this.<br />Dead Man Walking is about a nun (Susan Surandon) who receives a letter from a man, Matthew Poncelet, (Sean Penn) on death row. He asks her to come visit him, and they get to know eachother. At first the nun tries to help him prove his innocence, but when that fails she turns to helping him accept Christ and prepairing him for his execution. <br />This film is so moving, it will bring tears to your eyes and will make you re-think your opinion of the death penalty. An absolute MUST SEE!!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Who would have thought that almost 40 years after the release of arguably the greatest - yet definitely the most popular - western ever that there would be an extended English version which would bring Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach back into the studios?<br />Before being released in theaters in 67/68 for the American audience, the film was cut down to approximately 162 minutes, and there was never a need to loop the dialogue for the deleted scenes...until now.<br />It took the financing of AMC, the time and effort from the guys at MGM, along with the actors to pull this one through.  This 2-disc collector's edition is really something that even director Sergio Leone would be content with. He left behind an influential and stylish masterpiece long to be remembered. <br />As Eli Wallach once said, \\"You know, I'm getting on in age now and my hair is white. But every now and again I'll be walking down the street and someone will pass me, young and old, and whistle the theme of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly to me as they walk by.\\"
B00008NG5V|5.0|I enjoyed this CD very much the first time I ever listened to it.  The only problem, however, was it sounded a bit redundant.  The beats of many songs on this CD sound almost identical and Jack sings the lyrics the same way in almost all the songs.  However, The more I listened to the CD the more I enjoyed it.  I began to notice small distinctions between each of the songs that I thought sounded too alike.  Now I listen to the CD front to back at least 3 times a day.  I am a new fan of Jack Johnson and purchased this CD before Brushfire Fairytales.  I like On and On more than Brushfire Fairytales, athough, to be fair I haven't yet give Brushfire Fairytales the listen that it deserves.  On and On is very mellow/laid-back and unbelievably catchy.  I can't wait to play this CD over and over again on my back deck or up at a buddy's cottage this summer.  Best summer CD that I've ever heard.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Instead of giving a formal review of \\"Thirteenth Step,\\" I thought I'd review each song off of the album.<br />1) The Package: 10/10 - This song is a great opener.  You really get the feeling of the desperation in Maynard's vocals, and a sense of what he is going through.  The drums and bass are completely fitting for this song.  It has some extremely hard-hitting moments, and also melodic moments too...the build up, layering, texturing...it's all there, and it's the longest song on the album.<br />2) Weak and Powerless: 9/10 - Their first hit off the album, which also has a very surreal video to go with it.  It's lively and energetic, and is vocally and lyrically one of the best on the entire album.  It also flows extremely well into...<br />3) The Noose: 10/10 - THEE best song on the album, by far!  Maynard's voice is perfect in this song, and the haunting music almost sounds supernatural.  The build up to this song is unreal; maybe the best structural progression I've ever heard in a song.  The many layers and textures of this song can't be fully appreciated unless heard through headphones.  This is the absolute highlight of \\"Thirteenth Step.\\"<br />4) Blue: 9/10 - Blue happens to be my favorite color, and this song happens to be one of my favorites.  Lyrically this is one of the best songs on the album, and musically as well.  The duet for the chorus is done really well.  <br />5) Vanishing: 10/10 - My first listen through the album, this was my favorite song.  It has such a certain ambiance to it.  The lyrics aren't too complex, but the way they are presented on the track is amazing.  Maynard and Billy simply flow with the song so well.  This song honestly makes me feel like I'm vanishing.<br />6) A Stranger: 10/10 - What can I say?  Another 10 out of 10 on the album in my book.  The acoustic guitar sounds so good on this track.  Lyrically, this is my favorite song on the album.  It also has a lot of little details added to it -- echoes, effects, weird sounds...all brilliantly textured and layered for your listening pleasure.<br />7) The Outsider: 8/10 - APC's second hit off the album.  I don't know what it is about this song, but it gets stuck in your head...it really stays with you.  One of the heaviest tracks on the album, and Maynard shows ruthless aggression in his vocal style.<br />8) Crimes: 7/10 - Many would label it a filler song, but it has it's own uniqueness and clarity -- Maynard counts from 1-13 in a very haunting manner.  The drums are kind of catchy too.<br />9) The Nurse Who Loved Me: 9/10 - You won't find any guitar riffs here, but strings and other effects.  The lyrics are beautiful and scary at the same time.  It's definitely a new sound coming from APC.  It also goes really well into...<br />10) Pet: 10/10 - The heaviest most belligerent song to be found on \\"Thirteenth Step.\\"  Some hard-hitting riffs that flow into softer, more harmonious parts.  Maynard sounds eerie at times, and more aggressive at others; positively a focal point of the album.  The band seemed to let it all hang out on this track, and it goes wonderfully into the next track...<br />11) Lullaby: 8/10 - I wouldn't call this a filler at all.  This is the sweet sound of relief if you ask me.  It seems like all this desperation and weakness led up to this, and you feel at peace when you hear it.  How nice that a woman with a beautiful voice did this part, so you really get the feeling of being rid of what it was that hurt you.<br />12) Gravity: 10/10 - My favorite song after \\"The Noose.\\"  The guitar, bass, drums, and effects all come together.  It has an original sound and feeling to it, and lyrically ends the album off with a sense of accomplishment.  All these lyrics about addiction and demons, all seem to disappear when you hear this song.  Maynard ends with hope for his future -- \\"I choose to live.\\"<br />\\"Thirteenth Step\\" is a journey and an experience about addiction that is structured and progresses almost perfectly.  I would say this is the best album of 2003, and possibly my favorite album ever.  If you're expecting to hear \\"Mer de Noms\\" part 2, then you're out of luck here.  If you want to hear a great rock album that is unique and has it's own style, then you can't go wrong with the unpredictable \\"Thirteenth Step.\\"
6304884419|3.0|This was a well put together movie.  The characters, setting, and plot were easy to follow and it provide for a pleasurable viewing experience.  On the down side the strong language in the movie made it a turn off for me.  I loved this movie when it eared on cable networks with the strong language removed, but as a DVD and VHS movie it made my ears cringe.
0060537639|2.0|This is perhaps the silliest book I've ever read. It makes the Barry Fell book seem like solid research. It is very akin to Eric von Danekin's ideas and uses some of the same evidence but substitutes the Chinese for space aliens.<br />It only seems more plausible than von Danekin because it starts with the real historical figure of Zheng He. After establishing that the Zheng He fleet was large and had several voyages, Menzies goes off on a fantasy about the sixth voyage.<br />Some questions you might ask yourself about his account of the sixth voyage are: <br />Why did the fires and political upheavals only affect this voyage? There is quite a bit of documentation about Zheng He and his voyages to Africa and the Middle East. The book itself shows the famous picture of the giraffe. Why no pictures of polar bears or American Bison, or kangaroos? Menzies proposes very convienient fires and very thorough political enemies. Menzies also suggests that the Chinese transported the now extinct mylodon around the world. There is no evidence for this whatsoever.<br />Why didn't they go to Europe? Menzies claims the Chinese circumnavigated the planet, found Australia, Antartica, the North Pole (while circumvavigating Greenland), both coasts of both Americas, and the west coast of Africa. In other words they went everywhere there is to go except Europe. These phantom mariners seem to want to avoid people who kept records.<br />Why such a strange mixture of competence and incompetence? Menzies tells us the exact location, date, and time of day when the mysterious Chinese reached various points. He describes their junks as huge and sophisticated but since they could not tack they had to follow the currents and sail only before the wind. He then accounts for their failure to observe various islands or mountains by proposing that they sailed past them at night. He explains missed land masses as a product of observing mountains just over the horizon from near the water line and mistaking them for islands. By his extravagant set of theories he confidently explains the exact line his Chinese took through narrow channels and the time of day. Of course there is no evidence at all for any of this except his theory that the Chinese made up a series of now lost maps that predate the fifteenth century European maps.<br />What do you see in the maps? Menzies relies principally on map interpretation for his evidence. He uses several sixteenth century maps and a few fifteenth century maps. Almost all of them are European. In general they show Europe, the Mediteranian, and the Middle East in great detail. The maps before 1492 show one land mass with no continents in the Western Hemisphere. After 1492 they show the east coast of North America and South America.  None of this is surprising. We have long known that Columbus had a world map with him and we know pretty much what it looked like (no America). Magellan also had a map or maybe even several maps. There was no shortage of world maps before Columbus and Magellan. There is no mystery here. They had maps but the maps were increasingly ficticious as they diverged from Europe.<br />Menzies sees things in the maps that others can't see. He also fails to notice that his favorite map the Piri Reis, has many pictures of ships but they are all European ships. It also has a depiction of Saint Brenden which he doesn't mention. Maybe the Irish made a series of now lost maps? <br />He claims that the Piri Reis map shows the Straits of Megellan. He's nuts. It shows a river. He claims it shows Antartica (without the ice pack). He's nuts. It shows the South American coast line continuously bending to the east as had Ptolomy's maps of antiquity. He sees astounding details that he says can only be explained by copying from earlier (now lost) Chinese maps. He's nuts. He never mentions the second Piri Reis map of about ten years later. Piri Reis compiled maps from the best available sources for Sullieman the Magnificent.His second map encompassed the latest information from the early sixteeth century Spanish and Portugese voyages. The second map depicts North America much more accurately. Menzies believes in a lost Golden Age of Chinese mapmaking that Europeans copied. Then why do the maps get so much better only after the Europen voyages?<br />The first Piri Reis map is widely used by cranks to show space aliens were here or that there were pre-Pharonic Egyptians navigators. Menzies now uses it to show that the Zheng He voyages discovered America. Ha!<br />Finally the book claims that their is all sorts of genetic evidence of Chinese voyages in the fifteeth century. He's nuts and dishonest. The academic articles he cites say no such thing. They never mention Chinese DNA. These articles are written in response to a valid academic dispute over Native American ancestors. Some of this stems from the dispute that arose when the Monte Verdi site was found to be so much older than the Clovis site (recent vs. old). Some of it arose over the controversies around the Kenniwick Man skeleton (single Asian ancestor stock vs multiple Euro-Asian stocks). There was also a theory that the predecesors came by boat as well as by land bridge (sea vs land). <br />In light of this controversy there is a abstract of an journal article by Novick on Alu that refers to &quot;recent&quot; Asian contacts and that does not support multiple ancestor lines. Menzes quotes this phrase as evidence that there were Chinese fifteenth century ancestors whereas the abstract seems to refer to 13k BC Siberians. The full article by Novick et al is not posted anywhere on the web so I cannot be completely sure, but the book cites the ambiguous phrases from the abstract several times. <br />Menzes seems to assume that any study that finds genetic similaries between American Natives and Chinese supports his crank theory. Of course everyone has recognized the connection between American Indians and Asians since 1492 - the year Columbus deiscovered America.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I couldn't understand the hype when I first her first album, but this release certainly shows that she has grown.  I must say her remake of &quot;If I Was Your Woman&quot; is my least favorite track, simply because I believe if you choose to cover a classic, you need to be able to improve it, and this is not an improvement.  Overall, I enjoyed this CD and would recommend it to anyone.
006054094X|2.0|Let's review the boats. Could the Polynesians have sailed to America in one of their boats? Heyerdahl built Kon-Tiki. Could the Egyptians have sailed the Mediteranian and the Atlantic in a reed boat? Hyerdahl built the Ra. Could Saint Brendan have crossed the Atlantic in a skin covered corracle? Well some Irish built one and did it.<br />Did the Viking boat really perform well? Yes Modern Scandanavians have built them and they work just like it says in the sagas. Is a trireme possible? Sure is. Modern reconstructions with collegiate crews can get them up to high speeds.<br />Were the boats used by Columbus really seaworthy? Indeed they were. Modern replicas have crossed the Atlantic. <br />Finally, did the fifteenth century Chinese have boats five hundred feet long? Who knows? Maybe - maybe not.<br />Notice that every famous maritime vessel in history has been recreated by modern shipbuilding enthusiasts, marine architects, or archiologists. All that is except the legendary Zheng He 500 foot long junks.<br />The phenomenon of hogging argues that no wooden ship can be made so large if it is to traverse the open sea. Certainly there is no authenticated record of such a wooden ship having been built in the West or the East. This is an issue of materials. Wood simply isn't strong enough for certain tasks. Here in the Bay Area we have the Golden Gate and the Bay Bridge. Both of these have long spans of steel girders supported by steel cables. They could not have been built with wooden girders and hemp ropes. Smaller gaps can be spanned with these materials but not the Golden Gate. Similarly a rigid ship hull can't be longer than about 175 feet if made of wood. When a ship's hull in heavy weather is supported only by waves at the ends it must be strong enough to hold up the center. Similarly if it is supported only in the center it must be strong enough to hold up its ends. <br />Of course you could make a wooden vessel of indefinite length if it were nothing but a seriesof rafts tied together in the form of a snake. But the Zheng He junk is described as a single vessel composed of rigid water tight compartments.   <br />Personally I think the 500 ft junk is a myth but of course I could be wrong. Show me. Do a Kon-Tiki. Establish a fund. Build a replica sail it around the world. <br />Menzies says he is planning to do just that. However the junk being built is only about 150 feet long not the 150 meters of the mythical Zheng He boat. This will prove nothing. There have already been voyages by smaller junks from China to England. What is required is a full size replica not a 1/9th model.<br />Until then, as a person of Irish extraction I will prefer St. Brenden as my favorite crank pre-Columbian legend. After all the the book the Brenden Voyages relates a real recreation in a full size replica. The book 1421 just repeats tall tales.<br />Herodotus tells us that Xerxes crossed the Hellespont with two million men to invade Greece. Xerxes had an army and Zheng He had a boat no serious historian doubts that. However the exact measurements of Xerxes army and Zheng He's junk are very much in doubt. Indeed historians have to speculate on the real values because the legendary values are so clearly impossible.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I don't get it.  Sorry.  A quiet movie that I found relaxing to watch as there was not a lot of background music.  But, I don't get all the hype.  What was this movie about, other than 2 Americans who meet up in Japan and form a friendship?  What's the big deal?  I  kept waiting for the ball to drop or for Bill Murray to bust out and be Bill Murray.  Never happened.  Scarlett is very pretty and easy to watch. Only need to see it one time, if that.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Fans may debate on and on about whether Let It Be...Naked is faithful to The Beatles' legacy and how it compares to the original and so forth. However, let's take a detached view about this for a minute. How does 'Let It Be...Naked' actually sound, as an album? Now, the answer to this question is, absolutely bloody fantastic. Rather than judging it on whats included and what isnt lets accept that this just sounds great (and for the record, I think its better than the original). <br />Earthy acoustic tracks like 'Two Of Us' are balanced out by almost garage-y tracks like 'I've Got A Feeling'. Other songs that were previously accompanied by cheesy choirs are stripped to their beautiful essentials. Let's face it: these are brilliant pop songs, in whatever form. The acoustic tracks are gorgeous and the rockers have a simple, driving appeal not present since the Beatles' early days (with the odd exception such as Revolution). <br />NME somewhat pretentiously called this 'the best garage rock album ever', but they have a point about the ethic of the album. Not a bad track really, whatever the detractors may say. The one thing I would say is that I'm not sure this needs to be added to your library if you have the original and the extra tracks on some sort of compilation. However, if you've not got the original, this is a top buy, and as far as I'm concerned, above buying a copy as it was originally.
0141301074|5.0|The Twits are hilarous. After reading the book to my students they became hooked on Roald Dahl books.  They just had to read other of his books.  The pratical jokes the Twits play on each other is my students favorite part. I highly recommend this book and any other book written by Roald Dahl!
B000007R1M|3.0|Hear me out with this one: I know its an unpopular viewpoint. Its not that this album isn't good: it is. However in the context of modern music I find it over-rated. There's no question that this was a highly important album and that without it we would not have much of the great music we benefit from today. In this respect, the Man-Machine is a 5-star album. However, it terms of pure current listening pleasure, independent of this romanticising, the album scores lower. <br />It's still good, obviously, but due to its date the constraints on technology mean it sounds rather dated and simplistic now, dwarfed by the huge electronica/techno acts of the 90s like Aphex Twin and Underworld. Clearly they would not have existed without Kraftwerk, but they are further down the evolutionary scale, and thus, in a purely detached sense, better to listen to. There are some good pop songs here, notably 'The Model', but it is running out of steam in the modern music scene.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie had a little bit of humor, but overall, I was anything but amused.  I don't understand what the big deal is about a movie of two bored people who never really get &quot;unbored&quot;.  They bored me.  I kept wondering when this movie would take off...reminded me of seeing &quot;A Thin Red Line&quot; or &quot;Ghost World&quot; - just boring. I won't ever get that time back that I lost watching this film (or the money).
B00000099Y|3.0|I bought this CD after I was so impressed by Lateralus, one of the best rock cd's I have ever heard (in fact five stars is not enough for Lateralus). Indeed, Tool are very talented musicians. You can also discover this on Aenema. You can like it or not, but Tool has an overwhelming sound full of rithm that never gets boring. However, while Lateralus has very good lyrics (apart from the one-minute-made low-quality lyrics of Ticks and Leeches), this CD is full of anger and swear, sometimes lacking respect for other people. Yes, the lyrics contain some creative aspects, but a lot of parts are becoming very boring and cheap by the overusage of swearing words and \\"try-to-shock\\" words. In addition these lyrics contain a very negative message. Real-life however is more complex than that, real-life cannot be classified in the oversimplified good/bad dichotomy. However I can understand that for some people life can indeed be a hell. And for those people, maybe the lyrics make sense for a small period of time. But in the long run the negative undertone does harm all of us, it encourages us to always confirm ourselfs that everything is bad instead of taking action and fighting for your luck in a positive way.  And maybe these lyrics had a therapeutical effect for Maynard also, but the real challenge, James Maynard, is to try to fight in your life to make something positive of it. You definetely have the talent for it !!!. For me the real genius people fit into this fight-for-your-luck category. Only this latter category of people can be a real inspiration source for all of us. So while the Aenema lyrics contain some creative aspects, calling them intelligent and inspiring, is most of the time exagerated (just as calling these lyrics crap is also maybe exagerated). <BR>Fortunately we see a good and positive evolution in the more recent Tool albums, and I must admit that I am eager to hear new cd 's from Tool because they definitely demonstrated their huge talent in the Lateralus masterpiece ...
0793518326|5.0|This is one of the best, if not the best, songbooks that I've ever come across. It has the musicial notation for virtually every instrument played on all Beatles songs, including tab for bass and guitars. I've found it to be amazingly accurate, though not perfect. I have only two complaints: 1. It is not 100% accurate; in some songs when the verses repeat, I have found differences in the recorded version from what's in the book; 2. The print is very small. Both these complaints are very negligible relative to the work as a whole. It's still the most accurate songbook of any rock and roll music that I've ever found, and the small print is quite understandable considering the sheer volume of Beatles songs. I highly recommend this book for any Beatles fan or serious musician.
B00014NE62|5.0|Well, no one has mentioned the music yet.  The score, by Richard Robbins, is one of my all-time favorites.  The main theme manages to be both affirming and melancholic and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the film.
6305291489|5.0|Annie is thrilled to be going to camp in America.  She is horrified to discover a girl who looks just like her, however.  Hallie is equally upset, and they start playing mean tricks on each other.  When they are isolated as a result, they get to talking and discover that they are twins.  They plot to switch places for two reasons.  First, they want to meet their other parent.  Second, and more importantly, they hope to reunite their parents.  Complications greet Annie as Hallie in California when she discovers that their dad has gotten engaged over the summer.  His fiancee is a truly horrid woman who will make everyone's lives miserable.  But what can the girls do to change things?<br />This is pretty much a faithful remake of the original just updated for the 90's.  Lindsay Lohan bravely steps into Hayley Mills' famous double roll, and pulls it off with style.  This is her big screen debut, and she handles the rolls and the special effects with ease, seeming to switch characters convincingly at will.  This is a young actress to watch.  Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are wonderful as the parents caught in the trap.  They have incredible chemistry.  Frankly, I never found the romance in the original that believable, but this movie has romance in spades.  There are some truly great comic moments in the film and plenty of subtle hat tips to the original without slowing down the movie.<br />The DVD is simple, just the movie.  This was one of the first films that Disney released in the then new format, so that helps explain the lack of extras.  The film does look great in widescreen and sound great in surround, however.<br />As with any remake, there will be fans of one over the other.  Personally, this one edges out the original, but not by much.  There is plenty of charm and humor here to entertain without taking a thing away from the original.  If you approach with an open mind, you just might find a place in your heart for this one right beside the other.

B000001EL7|4.0|Reviews of Kiss albums are usually written by Kiss fans, which means in all likelihood you already HAVE this album!  But if not, here's the scoop:  it's a perfect time-capsule of melodic, riff-driven rock &amp; roll from 1977.  The only thing preventing this from being a 5-star recording is a comparison against the jaw-dropping brilliance of such albums as &quot;Alive!&quot; and &quot;Revenge.&quot;  Having said that, there are so many standouts here it's hardly funny.  The opener, &quot;I Stole Your Love,&quot; is a hard-hitting piledriver that used to open Kiss' show in both 1977-78 and again in 1989.  &quot;Christine 16&quot; has the kitschy (and totally enjoyable!) piano chorus a la &quot;Nothin' To Lose,&quot; with Gene doing a 50s-era speaking part in the middle that is hilarious and over-the-top.  Ace delivers his first solo vox on &quot;Shock Me,&quot; and shows why he's the George Harrison of Kiss in more than just his lead-guitarist status:  he's a continually overlooked songwriting resource from the original lineup.  Gene's salute to moulded appendages in &quot;Plaster Caster&quot; is a great tune in spite of its ridiculousness, but where he truly shines is on the growling, nearly painful &quot;Almost Human.&quot;  Peter's contribution is great:  &quot;Hooligan&quot; gets to his tough NYC upbringing, and I think songwriters are always strongest when they mine personal experience for their craft.  Even the cover of &quot;Then (S)He Kissed Me&quot; is fine, although why Kiss chose to cover something so outside of their supposed influences is beyond me.  In all a klassic Kiss record, one that would do any collection proud.  If you've seen the group live but haven't bought much from their back catalogue, there aren't many albums better than this one!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|What can I say, with all of the crap that Hollywood has been producing these last few years, it's nice to know that there is still talent in the industry.  This movie is the perfect example.<BR>I've heard so many different interpretations upon having conversations with friends about this movie.  Just when I think every angle has been covered, someone else comes up with a new perspective.  One friend has even suggested that the whole story can come across possibly from Cherita Chen's point of view because of her silent affection for Donnie and the book in which his name graces the cover.<BR>I'm not one for flashing back to the 80's, but this movie reminded me of the good music that came from those years. There is nothing like Echo and the Bunnymen's &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; to get me going.  Hell, every time I hear it now, I automatically think of the movie. Plus, the Bush and Dukakis presidential election debate clip along with the excellent use of Duran Duran's &quot;Notorious&quot; was an added bonus. <BR>It's cliched to say this, but this is a movie for people who like to think instead of just soak up pointless plots.  It's not as complicated as some may make it out to be and if this is Kelly's first major project, I can't wait to see what else he's got up his creative sleeve.  <BR>Great performances.  Great music.  Great story.  &quot;Chut up&quot; and check it out.
B00008NRLX|5.0|A lovely, mellow soft-rock set that really lives up to its name -- this is the kind of stuff you'd want to have on while the raindrops pitter-patter, pitter-patter along the windowpanes.  Of the rock-oriented Jayhawks albums, I'd say this is my favorite: there are several songs on it that are irresistibly tuneful (particularly &quot;Eyes Of Sarahjane&quot; and &quot;One Man's Problems&quot;) and the album as a whole hangs together really nicely.  Well-crafted, pleasantly listenable and quite hearftfelt.  Recommended!
B00005JL96|5.0|I didn't see \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" until it came out on DVD.  My 2 year old fell in love with this show immediately.  It had to grow on me a little bit before I realized just how great this movie about a little alien experiment trying to find a home was.  The message in the film is simple, but speaks volumes:  Family means that no one gets left behind or forgotten.  Lilo and her sister Nani accept Stitch into their family(ohana, in Hawaiian terms).  Lilo loves him right away, but Nani takes a little longer to convince that Stitch belongs.  Lilo and Stitch have some wild adventures together and even fight with each other when Stitch gets blamed for tearing apart the little family.<br />In classic Disney style, Stitch saves the day and proves that even if you aren't born into a family, you can become part of one.<br />This movie is a wholesome, fun movie for the entire family.  It holds the attention of the youngsters and the storyline is solid enough to keep adults interested.<br />The DVD has a number of extras that include a documentary on the Hula dance and how much time was spent to get it just right for the movie.  There is a great segment featuring Wynonna talking about how glad she was that Disney was promoting the music of Elvis Presley to youngsters via this flick.  For the youngsters, there is a video by a group of kids singing \\"I Can't Help Falling In Love With You.\\"<br />Superb family fun.
B00000AFWW|4.0|Several years ago, when I first got into Hole, I scorned this album. Back then I was on a 'hardcore' phase, and to hear any band revamp their sound for a more glossy Top 40 radio pop sound was met from extreme disapproval from my quarters. Now, several years later, I've calmed down a bit, let go a little of my punk rock and indie 'snobbery' and wholeheartedly admitted that I *gasp* like pop music. Yes, I love the pop sensibilities of the Go-Go's, R.E.M., and Fleetwood Mac, all of which seemed to have heavily inspired this album. What's unusual about Hole (and what many haters claim which shows Courtney's lack of talent) was that they never had a particular sound. 'Pretty on the Inside' sounded like Sonic Youth. 'Live Through This' was obviously the female version of Nirvana. And 'Celebrity Skin' became every pop band that Courtney Love always had a secret pension for. Interestingly enough, Hole was not the only '90s band to end their career with a pop album. The late '90s witnessed a whole surge of poppier alternative rock- as evidenced by the popularity of bands like Third Eye Blind, Goo-Goo Dolls, etc. Even independent 'punk-minded' bands like Bikini Kill ended their career with albums that were heavily polished and toned down. 'Celebrity Skin' is an album that is covered in California sunshine, but also retains some of the band's heavy, darker themes underneath. The first four songs are the most 'pop' sounding of the album, and midway through we are slowly transformed to a darker place. Many songs like 'Awful', 'Malibu', and 'Boys on the Radio' are sweet sounding in tone, but jaded in lyric, giving much of the album a bittersweet feel. The only song that seems to be throwaway pop is 'Heaven Tonight', which goes in one ear and out the other--and would have been more suitable if the wonderful b-side 'Best Sunday Dress' was used in its place instead. Not first the Hole album I would suggest first-time listeners go to, but one to quickly obtain once the others have taken up permanent space in your CD player and your mind.<br /><br />**Review written 1/14/08.

B00009L1TA|4.0|This is a movie that has a lot of action and a few twists.<br />Who can you really trust in this one.  Travolta plays his part very well.  What really happened.....that is what you have to figure out.<br />The interviews/interrogations are intense.  Can you piece together where this movie is going.  Terrific, simply terrific.
0451207521|4.0|Jackdaws <BR>I am a keen reader of Folletts work. Even though they all give similar flavor in different wrapping,  I think his ability keep the reader on the tip toes must be commendable. <BR>Jackdaws refers to a time when Allies were on putting final touches to the invasion of Europe. The main character named \\"flick\\", with remarkable endurance did the most damages to Germans before the invasion. They hit the heart of the German Communications, that connected the rest of Europe with Nazi HQ. <br />Storey is full of suspense the typical spy stuff even more it has a human angle to it as well. The author has added several twists to the story by way of adding several love and hate scenes to the picture. There is a similarity in this love and hate in Jackdaws as well as in \\"Lie down with Lions\\". <BR>All in all JACJDAWS is a yet another excellent work from Ken Folletts.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Taking the original matrix one step further and deeper.  Seeing the inner workings of Zion was exciting.  A little too sexual in places, that was a surprise, even a rave party of sorts.<br />Not as good as the original, but it definately had some very interesting concepts.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Here's something for Brit bashers and tabloid reporters to think about. She's still here. Yep! And she's enjoying fabulous success with this, her fourth and possibly best yet, album. I'm sure it's a surprise to some, but they'll just have to cope with it. People can call her talent into question all they like, but it won't stop her from being an incredibly capable pop performer. She doesn't need to wail like a banshee a la Christina to be able to craft excellent pop tracks like the ones on this album.<br />In fact, the current top 40 smash 'Toxic' blows away almost every Britney and Christina single. It's sheer pop perfection in under three and a half minutes. The first single 'Me Against The Music', of course, isn't nearly as good the current one. Madonna's guest vocal did have a hint of desperation about it, but it provided both with a top 40 hit, and is availble on here in both original and remix versions.<br />Britney does appeal to the current formula to making a hit single on '(I Got That) Boom Boom' featuring the Ying Yang Twins and the R.Kelly penned 'Outrageous', but neither should make an appearance on the charts, as they are most definitely the worst pair of tracks on this record. Shockingly, Britney's usual weak point with creating dull ballads doesn't really hit hard on this album, with 'Everytime' providing an actually worthwhile listen.<br />While that track is sweet, Britney's best tracks are made for dancing and grinding. The Kylie Minogue inspired 'Breathe On Me' is a sexy dance pop number that needs to be a future single. The funky 'Showdown' is also a big personal favorite. I also like the slinky Moby produced 'Early Mornin' quite a bit. Suprisingly, the self pleasure themed 'Touch Of My Hand' proves to be a solid track.<br />The rest of the album contains the same quality expected from Britney as one of pop music's premier starlets - catchy and well crafted. Britney has long since moved beyond the label of being 'Today's Debbie Gibson', and withmore records like this she'll be deserving of a title more like 'Tomorrow's Madonna'.
B00009RDG9|4.0|Jones and Del Toro are at total war.  This movie is very violent and a little gorey in parts.  The subject is very interesting.  Where did they come up with this concept for a movie?<br />The violence fits the story, however, the irony of the beauty of the Northwest and the gore of the movie are totally opposite.  This is the story of a teacher who must go after a student who has strayed.  Del Toro is absolutely believable.  Jone's does a credible job in tracking down his student and in fighting.  The constant battle gets to be much.  Yet you see Jones using stick-to-itiveness throughout and there are many opportunities for him to give up.  He is constantly inventing new things using the surrounding area he is in.<br />This movie takes from Bosnia, to the Northwest US.  Del Toro goes from hero to hunted and you wonder who the real prey is.
B0000AZAUM|5.0|Although I don't have a gigantic collection of rock SACDs, this 5.1-channel digital remix of \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" is absolutely beautifully done, and if any of your friends are on the fence about SACD, play this disc for them.  Also play this disc for them if they have somehow never heard it, say they do not like David Bowie much (!?), need to be cheered up--basically any excuse will do.<br /><br />When you play \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" on SACD, you will hear many new instrumental tracks that got lost in the original stereo mix.  For example, on \\"Suffragette City,\\" you can actually hear the acoustic guitar track on the rear-surround channels!  Many of the songs almost sound like new recordings of your old favorites, because there is so much new material you can now *hear* for the very first time.<br /><br />But for me, the most impressive features of this SACD were the absolutely *visceral* response my body had to the music, and the truly outstanding quality of the digital re-mix.  I have probably listened to the stereo mix of the vinyl and CD of the album many more than 100 times, and I obviously love it.  But when I listen to this SACD, I can actually *feel* the music in the pit of my stomach, in my legs--in my whole body, really.  It seems as if I have been transported inside a virtual musical snowglobe, and someone is shaking it up: Bowie's music swirls all around me, through me, and then back out all around the room.  My heart starts beating faster--wildly almost--and it feels as if the music is pouring in through every single pore in my body.  BTW, I do not use drugs, so this is not some description of a \\"freak-out\\" in a \\"moonage daydream\\" (in D.B.'s words).  I also do *not* have an extremely high-end audiophile set-up; my SACD player is a modest Pioneer DV-563A, Infinity speakers, separate Klipsch subwoofer, Kenwood SS processor.<br /><br />The \\"liner notes\\" are also very, very good, have all the lyrics, and contain many full-color photos I have never seen before.<br /><br />Bottom line: Buy this SACD, intensify (or rekindle) your love affair with music, and have a near-religious experience in your living room.intensify (or rekindle) your love affair with music, and have a near-religious experience in your living room.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Can a machine really be that funny?<br />The new concept of a woman cyborg was very interesting.  This is the end of the beginning, I hope they can take it to a new level and develop what happens next....<br />This movie is worth seeing.  It answers the question of what happened to the characters in T2. It seems that the machines really wanted to take it to humanity though.
0743243307|5.0|I am from Bangladesh, and have lived in the West for some years.  Although Westernized in many ways, I am acutely aware of the experience of being brown and Asian in the West.  Monica Ali's &quot;Brick Lane&quot; touches me in multiple ways.<br />&quot;Brick Lane&quot; is unique.  There are many novels centered on Bengali housewives; unfortunately most are in Bengali and not translated.  The number of novels with Bangladeshi women as protagonists is smaller.  Novels dealing with Bangladeshi immigrant women are very rare --- Ms Ali is exploring new ground here.  And she does it so touchingly, with such attention to detail and nuances.<br />The novel is about Nazneen, born in a Bangladeshi village and married off to an older man who is an immigrant in England.  Nazneen moves to England, submits herself to fate as she has been taught to, bears life and children and her husband's stupidities, and watches her daughter grow Westernized.  Eventually, she surprises herself by her own initiative, taking a lover and deciding not to return to Bangladesh with her husband.<br />Other than Nazneen, the main characters are her husband Chanu, and her sister Hasina whom we meet through her letters to Nazneen written over the years.  We also meet several other immigrant Bangladeshi characters living in Brick Lane, and get flashbacks of Nazneen's life in Bangladesh.<br />Through Hasina's sporadic letters to Nazneen, which take up significant parts of the book, we follow the life of an unmarried lower-class woman in Bangladesh.  Hasina, unlike Nazneen, chooses her own path in life and elopes as a teenager, but her husband leaves her and she suffers through a series of ordeals.  Her life story is probably realistic and reflects the lives of the many poor rural women in Bangladesh who have moved to the cities in recent years, forced to be independent in a patriarchial society that resists women's independence.<br />Like other reviewers, I was annoyed by the author's choice to transcribeHasina's letters in broken English.  This is the only major complaint I have about the book.<br />The characterization of Nazneen's husband, Chanu, is masterly.  Chanu is an educated but completely impractical person.  A complete failure in British life, he toils away as a clerk hoping that his culture &amp; worth will someday be appreciated.  He borrows money and leaves his wife to deal with the usurer.  He appreciates the wrong people, and is completely unable to deal with his daughter's rebellion.<br />Perhaps even more paradigmic is Chanu's pompous behavior with his wife.  The Bengali male, it has been said, is a great loser in life and a fearless lion in dealing with his subservient wife.<br />Chanu actually thinks of himself as a liberated man, whose wife has complete freedom in theory.  In practice, unfortunately, Nazneen does not get to taste any of these freedoms (such as learning the local language English).  The reason is that &quot;she does not need them&quot;, as Chanu assures her, and also because it is unnecessary to evoke gossip in the immigrant community.<br />Chanu's laziness, his readings in impractical subjects, reminds me of my brother :-) And his complete inability to actually listen to anything Nazneen says, reminds me of my father's treatment of my mom.  In return, Nazneen's response to Chanu, her near-complete acceptance and sporadic rebellions, reminds me of my mom and some aunts.<br />As for the other characters, Nazneen's friend Razia is drawn beautifully, a strong woman who decides to Westernize herself, and keeps her enormous humor and sarcasm intact through the adversities of immigrant life.  I liked her imitation of pompous people, a very Bengali kind of humor.<br />A minor character particularly attracted me, Nazneen's aunt Mumtaz, seen almost entirely in flashbacks.  Quietly strong, in a manner peculiar to some Bengali rural women.  I have an aunt like that.<br />The writing is, for the most part, low-keyed and subdued.  This styleseems fitting, as it reflects Nazneen's accepting, compromising attitude to life.  Sometimes quietly funny, and sometimes emotionally exhausting, not always an easy book to read.<br />There are some masterful descriptions, like that of Nazneen before her nervous breakdown watching her dead mom slide across her living room.  Like the hilarious jostling among different brands of pseudo-Islamic factions in the young Bengali community.  Or Razia being spat on after September 11, on a London street wearing a Union Jack T-shirt.  And so on and so forth.  <br />Ms Ali has done a wonderful job.  To the non-Bengali reader, I have an invitation: welcome to my world.  Maybe you will find the setting too alien for you to be interested in.  But maybe (I hope) you will actually discover a beautiful story set amongst a struggling people.
B00005MAM2|4.0|Any Otaku who claims to be an otaku has or will see Akira. It is the pen-ultimate anime Movie, great soundtrack, great animation, and one of the coolest sci-fi stories ever. The only gripe I have with the special edition is that the dubbing is really sub-par.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Let me start off right away that I have never been a fan of Britney Spears. I always have, and always will be strictly a CHRISTINA fan. Anywayz, I think that Britney's \\"In The Zone\\" is her best album to date (that's not saying much).<br />1) ME AGAINST THE MUSIC - This song is the reason I purchased this album. I hated myself for loving this song, but I just can't help it! I love Madonna's cameo in this one! This is just a great song to listen to. *9.5/10*<br />2) (I GOT THAT) BOOM BOOM - Another good song. I like the Ying Yang Twins ok, so I liked their appearance on the track. I good dance song. *9/10*<br />3) SHOWDOWN - This one is not one of my favorites. I think the beat is a little generic and the lyrics aren't that strong. *7/10*<br />4) BREATHE ON ME - My favorite on the album. I like it because it sounds similar to Madonna's song, \\"Bedtime Stories\\". A great sexy song. *10/10*<br />5) EARLY MORNIN' - I was surprised when I heard this track was a studio collaboration with Moby. I think this song is a little boring. *7.5/10*<br />6) TOXIC - Another favorite of mine. I love the music even though I think Britney's vocals are horrible on this one. I must say though, being a guy, I love the video for this song. ;) *9.5/10*<br />7) OUTRAGEOUS - I hate this song. The music is nothing special and the lyrics are just rediculous! Who wants to hear Britney singing about how her sex drive is outrageous? Not me! *6/10*<br />8) TOUCH OF MY HAND - The infamous song on the album. I think everyone reading this knows that this song is about masturbation. I think Britney is trying just a little too hard to appear \\"mature\\" and I think it blew up in her face. Nevertheless, I like this song. It's catchy and is just an overall good pop song. *8.5/10*<br />9) THE HOOKUP - Ugh! This is horrible! Britney trying reggae? BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! This one is just NOT working for me.. *3/10*<br />10) SHADOW - Again, ugh! This song is bland, boring, and just plain awful! *2.5/10*<br />11) BRAVE NEW GIRL - Again, bland, boring, and just plain stupid! *4/10*<br />12) EVERYTIME - The ballad on the album. I don't think Britney should record anymore slow songs. She just doesn't sound good singing them. I think this song is sweet and I do like it for what it is, I just don't think it's a good song. Make sense? Don't understand? That's ok. *7/10*<br />13) ME AGAINST THE MUSIC REMIX - This should have been left off the album completely. It's no different than the original, but just the music is tweaked a little. No new vocal arrangement, no new stuff... nothing new. *5.5/10*<br />Well here you have it. Britney's in the zone. It's not worth spending the money. But it's good to listen to every once in a while. Burn it off the internet. <br />88.5/130 = 68% = D+<br />RECOMMENDED: No
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Anybody else notice that all these one-star reviews were written on Feb 4 by the same person?  I think they should delete most of those so people don't have to wade through trash to get some honest opinions.  By the way, the movie's okay.
B00012QM8G|5.0|It is hard to state the importance of this film, either socially or morally, but to call it anything less than that would be a mistake. Schindler's List was not the kind of film I had at first expected to come from Steven Spielberg, having grown up with E.T. and Close Encounters. To say that I was surprised by the power of this film would be a gross understatement, never before I have found myself so moved by a work of cinema. The subject matter is so disturbing, the images haunt you long after the film has ended and Spielberg's use of black and white is a stark contrast to what we expect from movies today. If there is any movie that I would recommend, any film that I would beg my friends and family to witness... it is Schindler's List. It will stand throughout the ages as a testament to the horrors of the Holocaust, and the power that we each, as individuals, have to change the world even in the face humanity's worst. With a little help, and powerful reminders like this, maybe one day we truly will make certain that such a horrific act will never again take place.
B000067J1H|5.0|This movie is a good movie because the story line was very well written. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and at the times when it was supposed to, it gave me chills. On top of the great story line, the actors made the movie connect well with me. On the other hand, after watching the movie, one should feel oddly because the mood of the movie is very depressing. It gives you sympathy for people with multiple personalities disorder. I highly recomend this movie to people with stable lives and personalities. I believe this movie could affect and shape anyone who is weak and cause them to act the way the characters did.
B000084T18|1.0|0 stars.  This guy is the biggest poser in the world of rap.  I remember even before I heard this guys music I learned he'd been shot 9 times.  &quot;Wow,&quot; I said to myself....&quot;i better go by this album!  I mean, the guys been shot before! That must give him cred, right?  I mean, TuPac was shot, and so was .50 cent.  So, .50 cent must be good, right?&quot; NOT!  Don't believe the hype! .50 cent is just like all these corporate boy bands, emo rock bands, and strokes clones.  no previous musical output, but their first record gets all hyped up and blasted all over America.  It's talentless crap.  Go buy Outkast's new album if you want to hear what the future of rap holds.
B0000CFW87|5.0|If you want to see my thoughts on this CD, see the review from coolaucklanderdude on the 5th February, for some bizarre reason they have copied my review, from Amazon.co.uk, word for word. I am flattered!!<br />So all I need to add is way to go Josh!
0671027344|5.0|There's no denying that this book rules. The way it's written and everything, and it's all toped off by that more-than-lovely poem. It's really just simply the best, and nothing less, and I'd bet if you read it, you'll fall in love with it too, and if not, go nuts.

B00005JLET|5.0|Its amazing how an animation can have such an effect on a person. It's really a very good movie, not recommended for young children as it can be quite nightmarish.<BR>But crammed full of moral lessons and loveable characters...<BR>Entertaining, touching and unpredictable, a combination not always found in animations.<BR>Also a great for anime lovers.<br />It centres around a young girl lost in a world for spirits and trapped in their bath house as a servant bound by a contract with the witch that owns the place.<BR>Trying to save her parents and friends she learnns valuable lifes lessons and so did I as a veiwer.
B000001ZS3|3.0|This was once one of my favorite Electronic albums (yes, vinyl)<BR>from the 80s. However I feel that it (and it's companion release Equinoxe) sound VERY dated when compared to the works of Tangerine Dream/Ash Ra/ Klaus Schulze from the same time. Don't misunderstand, it's still good music, and I recommend it (especially over his later works.)
6301562178|4.0|In the mid and late 1970s, disaster movies became all the rage. Everything from capsized ships to earthquakes to famous disasters became the filmmaking rage.  THE TOWERING INFERNO is one of the better disaster films made. It has a decent storyline and some solid acting from a crew of Hollywood heavyweights (including Fred Astaire and Steve McQueen). Some of the dialogue is rather cheesy and for the first third of the movie, the film strolls by like a bad soap opera.  But then the fire starts and things pick up.<br />The movie was partially made in honor of firefighters and was dedicated to their heroic efforts. The movie also helped raise awareness about big city building safety in the modern era. New safety and fire codes were enacted in the late 1970s, in part to the awareness brought about by THE TOWERING INFERNO.<br />Looking back on this film nearly thirty years after it's initial release, the movie has also taken on a new meaning. The film seems almost a tribute to the heroes of 9-11 and a homage to all they did. Watching it recently, I couldn't but help see the comparisons between this film and the tragic events of that fateful day. Only true art can do that and though this was once nothing more than a classic Hollywood disaster film, it can now be recognized as something a little more.
B0000057C5|3.0|Let me start buy saying yes i am a fan but i dont why the hype is huge everyone is in love with them but why unless you speak German you really dont understand what their saying but dont get me wrong they have great tunes to all their music this Cd i thought would be better if it had no words that music is just mosh music not really listening music if you get what im saying so leaving you with a 3 star rating i wish they would sing english
B00005B4GU|4.0|I wasn't that impressed with Amnesiac, to tell you the truth. But somehow I find myself humming the backwards voice in &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; and the electronic intro of &quot;Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box.&quot; This CD doesn't reflect badly on Radiohead at all, because they always turn up with haunting songs, like &quot;Pyramid Song.&quot; It's very similar to Kid A, but it probably would have been better without some of the instumentals, and if they didn't include the depressing follow-up to &quot;Morning Bell.&quot; My favorite songs on Amnesiac are &quot;Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box&quot;, &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, and &quot;Knives Out.&quot; Here's what I think about the songs.<br />1. Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box - 8/10<BR>2. Pyramid Song - 10/10<BR>3. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors - 8/10<BR>4. You And Whose Army? - 6/10<BR>5. I Might Be Wrong - 8/10<BR>6. Knives Out - 9/10<BR>7. Amnesiac / Morning Bell - 4/10<BR>8. Dollars &amp; Cents - 6/10<BR>9. Hunting Bears - 4/10<BR>10. Like Spinning Plates - 8/10<br />11. Life In A Glass House - 7/10<br />Overall, this CD wasn't there best, but they still pulled off Amnesiac with a few incredible songs that you won't forget. I liked OK Computer a little better though.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|I bought the \\"Alien Legacy\\" boxed set over a year ago which is basically this set with additional features. These movies have been tried to be emulated but without success over the years. No other \\"alien\\" movie has come close to the scariness of this one. This is the original movie set that will make you SCREAM, whether or not you are in space(i.e., in space no one can hear you scream).<br />The entire 4 movies are good. Each one different than the other. The first and second of course are the best. The third one took a few times to like since it was so different. The fourth one is more like a horror movie. The final creature alien is something out of a nightmare.  But it is still a very good movie with Winona Ryder. <br />Also, I'm starting to believe a fifth \\"Alien\\" movie is in the works since the fourth left you hanging as they were flying toward earth (is there an alien on the space ship that will invade the earth?). Whatever happens, this set is definately a must for the horror movie fanatic.
B000003TAL|5.0|A few years ago, i saw Sonic Youth live. For their first song, Thurston Moore said &quot;This is for all the OLD people in the audience!&quot;, and started strumming &quot;Teenage Riot&quot;. At least i could feel good that he's older than me. :} That song, on this album, was my introduction to Sonic Youth, the week the album came out. I've been a devoted fan ever since. <br />&quot;Teenage Riot&quot; is one of the ten best rock songs ever written (along with the likes of Marquee Moon, 21st Century Schizoid Man...), and Daydream Nation is one of the ten best albums. If you're a fan of sprawling, coherent concept albums like Dark Side of the Moon, OK Computer, The Soft Bulletin, etc, you'll love this. For over 70 minutes, the band holds it together perfectly, one idea flowing into the next like a lover's conversation. There isn't a single misplaced or unnecessary note. <br />It's a desert island album, for sure.
B00005JJX8|3.0|As a connoisseur of Hitchcock's work, To Catch a Thief was merely adequate.  Lacking any real suspense, the movie was held together by the excellent cinematography offered by the picturesque French Rivera locale.<br />Cary Grant was at his suave and debonair best as John Robie, a retired cat burgular who is suspected when a rash of jewel thefts plagues the swanky Riviera.  Realizing, he must apprehend the actual thief, whose m.o. parallels his own, he plots a scheme.<br />Grace Kelly, whose acting ability does not rival her beauty, plays a perfectly typecasted role for her.  As a spoiled, bored, rich socialite Frances Stevens, she and her wealthy but earthy mother, played exceptionally well by Jessie Royce Landis are vacationing.  The elder Mrs. Stevens has a valuable collection of jewelery that Grant theorizes would make excellent bait.<br />Hitchcocks creates a predictable plot, with the usual love affair. There is however, little in the way of mystery or tension or even chemistry between Kelly and Grant to make this flick anything more than mediocre.  Edith Head provides a high point with her fantastic wardrobes created for the costume ball scene.
B00003CX9S|5.0|&quot;Time hath not altered&quot; the emotional impact this movie has on me when I watch it. The word &quot;poignant&quot; has grown hackneyed from overuse, but it certainly applies to this great film. Few films can equal it in terms of dramatic artistry and pitch perfect performances. There's not one maudlin note in a film that could easily have descended into bathetic melodrama in lesser hands.<br />Lynch was practically a neophyte at the time he directed this movie, yet to many (and to most, for that matter, save the true believers) THE ELEPHANT MAN is his magnum opus. I believe this is because of the mostly Britsh, classically trained actors that made up the cast. Hopkins and Hurt excell. Anne Bancroft (who I believe is the only American in the cast) delivers a flawless performance. Freddy Jones, as Bytes (this was before the internet, remember) is simply uncanny in his tour-de-force portrayal of arguably the vilest villain in cinema history. Who cares that the character was totally innacurate, historically? He chews up the scenery in true Grand Guignol fashion. Gielgud and Wendy Hiller are also on hand to provide levitas. One can't find a better ensemble. It's criminal that at least one of them weren't awarded an Oscar, but that's just another example of how meaningless those little gold statuettes are, more often than not.<br />Though this is a lot more linear than most of Lynch's movies, there is enough of the surreal on hand to keep the die hards happy. But the surrealism doesn't get in the way of the plot. Christopher de Vore and Eric Bergren, who collaborated with Lynch on the screenplay, can take some credit for that. Veteran cinematographer, Freddie Francis did perhaps the best work of his career here. The black and white images are as good as it gets. The sets are unforgettable. Victorian London has never looked so convincing on screen, yet with that nightmarish quality that defines most of the movie.<br />If you've never seen this movie, get your hands on a copy, soon. It couldn't be described as &quot;weepy,&quot; by any means. But if you're not reaching for the kleenex at some stage in this marvellous film, I'd ask the Wizard for a heart, if I were you. For those of you who haven't seen it in a while, give it a re-viewing. It absolutely holds up, particularly in comparison to 1980 Best Picture, ORDINARY PEOPLE...and Best Director, Robert Redford? Hopkins didn't get nominated, but Jack Lemmon did for TRIBUTE? Anyone remember that one? Gotta go find some Maalox.<br />BEKnds on a copy, soon.

B00005JMTN|5.0|I was sort of reluctant to see this movie when it first came out.  Lots of reviews that I had read said it was good for the first 15 minutes and then went in a downward spiral from there.  I also heard on the radio that the movie was three and a half hours long, and when a movie is that long, it's a big hunk of time that you need to take out of your day to watch the movie.  Finally, I went to see the movie and I am glad I did.  <BR> <BR>I thought the opposite of what the reviews that I had read said.  The first 15 minutes of the movie seemed like a sappy chick-flick movie about a son remembering storys that his dieing father had told him as a little boy, and then the rest of the movie sped up into a supernatural story of a man's life-long adventure.  And the movie was a little over two hours, so I guess the radio lied.  <BR> <BR>Now for a little plot summary, that may give out some of the stuff that happens in the movie, continue reading.  I'll try not to give too much away.  Big Fish was the story of a father and a son who didn't speak in years, speaking to each other for the first time in that time.  The son had always been told exagerations of the truth by his father (or so he thought), and got very annoyed at his Dad's fish stories.  This meeting between the father and son was because the father had become very ill, and was about to die. From that point on, through a series of flashbacks, you got to see the fathers life story his way, told my many different narrators.  Through the father's adventures, he befriended giants, joined the circus, fought in WWII in Japan and met up with a pair of Siamese Twins, found a perfect town, and then saved it, got married, caught a really big fish on the day his son was born and then let it go, and saw the way he would did in the glass eye of a witch.  Then the father had a stroke.  He was rushed to the hospital, and through much strain, asked his son to tell him the way that he would die, and then wispered the word river.  Hehad never told his son what he had seen in the witch's glass eye, so the son had to make up the story of his fathers death which had to do with the river.  After the son was done with the story, his fathers last words were \\"Exactly!\\" and died.  At the funeral, you got to see all of the people from the fathers stories, and as a suprising truth to the son that it wasn't all made up.<BR> <BR>The moral of the story:  Sometimes telling a exgerated lie based on the truth is much better than hearing the truth itself.  As the son found out, his father's version of how things happened was much more exciting and entertaining than the way they happened in reality.  And it also proved that dieing doesn't need to be a sad thing if you go out the right way.<BR> <BR>The movie had great special effects of the weird and supernatural too.  Having 12 foot tall giants standing next to 6 foot men was a nice feat, although at some points you could tell when puppets were being used.  The Siamese Twins were great and of course, the big fish in the movie was very realistic.  It was very Tim Burton-ish.<BR> <BR>For paying tribute to other movies.  Big Fish did that alot.  Many aspects of the movie reminded me of the movie Citizen Kane.  From all of the different charactors telling their version of the story to the father weezing out \\"the river\\" (aka- rosebud) on his death bed, I found it very alike.  I don't know if this one was purposeful, but the fathers wedding ring reminded me of the ring from Lord of the Rings.  <BR> <BR>Everything was consistent in this movie for the most part.  There weren't any plot holes except for the Circus Ringmaster.  At one point he turned into a wild wolf, and then switched back to human, and I didn't really understand the purpose behind this transformation.  Maybe I should read the book that the movie is based on.<BR> <BR>Overall, this is a great movie.  Go and see it.
0385510438|4.0|By 1970 the Ford County Times went bankrupt sped up by local boycotts when the owning family began adding obits of Negroes to the newspaper.  Former cub reporter Willie Traynor, who went north for college, drops out of school, takes over the troubled paper from the aging Caudle family to the dismay of most of the white populace of the Mississippi County.<br />Willie's paper gets a circulation boost when the police arrest Danny Padget for the vicious rape murder of Rhoda Kasellaw, a widow mother of two young children, who identified the culprit before she died.  Being a spoiled member of a prominent family, Danny threatens the jurors if they convict him, which they surprisingly do as the evidence besides the deathbed statement of the victim is overwhelming.  Less than a decade later, Danny is freed and the jurors are being killed off one by one.  Willie, who admired the first black juror in the county's history, Miss Callie Ruffin, risks his life to keep her safe, but retribution is coming.<br />The insightful look at little things that add up to major social relationships in 1970s Mississippi during a time of revolutionary change is John Grisham at his best.  Those minor items like an obituary for a deceased black person or the first black juror brings the era into stark reality.  However, when the tale twists into a serial killer storyline, that subplot is very exciting, but also takes the focus away from the social lens of change and upheaval.  Still John Grisham entertains his fans with a terse suspense tale that is<br />quite as superb as A TIME TO KILL, thus pleasing his vast readership.<br />Harriet Klausner

0875845851|4.0|Christensen's presentation of technology and the distinct differences of the impact that a \\"disruptive\\" technological innovation on general business management processes is nothing less than profound.  He hits on the idea that running a business, with a known market and customer base, has very specific tactical management techniques that need to be applied in order to be a market leader.   He develops the notion that a disruptive technology which may eventually be utilized in an existing market should first be placed into the hands of adopters that may live outside the traditional market.  This is a very eye opening read for anyone in an industry that experiences technological innovation.  His analysis provides useful tools that are not adequately covered by traditional MBA course curricula.  Some of these observations would lead managers to first stop and identify the type of technological innovation that they are attempting to manage and develop, specifically whether it is a market sustaining technological innovation or a disruptive technological innovation that is not yet mature enough to be attractive to the existing and well understood market.  A true boot camp presentation for MBA graduates who desire to augment their skills in order to be successful in an era with short product lifecycles and perpetual emergence of applications for fresh and potential underdeveloped technologies.

B00000K3D4|5.0|This is a great movie, and after 700+ reviews that equal out to a five-star rating, I don't think I need to go into why, as it's all been said by now.<br />Here is what I will comment on.  The acting of Sarah's parents.  I watched this movie when I was maybe ten or younger, and at that point, did not notice this.  But watch it again, and you will see that their acting, especially her father, is worse than the puppets. (The puppets were great, of course.)  It's actually so bad it's funny.<br />This minor flaw in the movie does not diminish the number of stars, but to me, heightens the enjoyment.  The parents are only in the movie for a few minutes.  But they are laugh-out-loud funny to listen to.  Enjoy!
0385504209|1.0|I was pleased to see that many readers had the same reaction to the Da Vinci Code as I.  Great subject matter.  Could have made a very strong book.  Puerile plotting and narrative.  I felt like I had ordered one of those No Downpayment kits from an infomercial.
B00005JKJA|2.0|There are tons of reviews already posted for this movie, and most people take an extreme -- love it or hate it; think it's artsy or think it's boring.  Well, it doesn't matter which side I fall on for this review, but I wanted to add something new to the discussion:<br />The verbiage on the box is misleading.  When I rented this movie from the video store, I thought I knew what it was about.  I did not know it would be so artsy that I would need to get a translater.  I was not prepared to watch a movie that involved so much symbolism that hours of online hunting and pecking gave me only the smallest clue as to what I had actually seen.<br />I picked this movie off the shelf because, from the words on the box, I thought it was the sort of murder mystery I could sit back, pop some popcorn, and fall right into.  This is not that kind of movie.  So, reader beware, if you are looking for a film that you can easily watch -- one that does not take your full concentration and then extensive research thereafter -- this is not the movie for you.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|Despite what many people have heard about the Strokes, (ranging from being the saviors of rock to the most uninteresting and useless tossers around), they have put out another good effort that fills the &quot;pop gap&quot; the music industry has been expereincing over the last few years.  Although I found their previous record &quot;Is this it?&quot; stronger, &quot;Room&quot; has a handful of catchy tunes that are worth rotation in your CD/MP3 player.  Actually the first five songs (What ever happened, Reptilia, Automatic Stop, 12:51, you talk way too much) are the best on the album, with the rest being more or less filler.  One wonders if the Strokes would do better to release four song EP's and leave us wanting more instead of putting out entire albums with a bunch of fat that forces a disc change halfway through the album.<br />As far as the hype - try to forget it &amp; enjoy the music.  I gauge this record by the fact that when I listen to it (at least the first five songs)I sing along &amp; feel good doing it.  Don't look to the Stokes to save your soul or popular music.  That group is already out there and tearing it up while everyone else is worried about the Stokes &amp; what you think about them.
6304806418|5.0|This is a musical that I have not seen done live -- only on the screen.  So I cannot say how this compares to the theatrical presentation.  My opinion of this movie is extremely high, as it captured me at once, and the musical-lover that I am, I adored the fact that almost every word of the movie was sung.<br />But what I really want to comment on here is that if you have stayed away from this movie because you think it might be another &quot;Who's That Girl?&quot; -- don't!  Madonna does an excellent job in this film.  It is the role she always wanted to play, and I don't think anyone could have done it better than her.  She surprised me with her extraordinary performance.  She BECAME Eva Peron, embodied her passion, her soul.  <br />Great music, great acting, great cinematography.  Great movie, and if you like musicals, it's a must-have for your collection.
B000000P17|1.0|Save your hard-earned money, folks. This album is the epitome of laziness and ego. When a band thinks you want to hear its interpretations of other artists' songs, you know they've jumped the shark. Skid Row fell into a similar trap around the same time.
B0000640VO|5.0|If your girlfriend picks out one of those dreadful foreign films that feels more like a reading assignment than a pleasure cruise, take note of Amelie!  This movie is in another language, but I promise you that after a few minutes, you will be so involved in the story, you will forget that you are reading while you're watching.  <br />My favorite thing about Amelie (and there are so many things; see 750+ reviews!) is how each character is introduced with something they like and something they don't.  How true this is, that it is the little things that make up a person.<br />This movie is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen! - says a person who likes to see her own handwriting photocopied and does not like wide open eyeballs.
B000002KHB|5.0|This is considered by many to be Deep Purple's landmark. And with good reason.  It captured a moment in time where Purple was at the peak of their powers.  It contains the unexpected hit &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;.  One of the greatest rock &amp; roll songs ever and I believe still banned in guitar shops throughout the U.S. &quot;Highway Star is another great song.  It is a fast hard driving song that should please rock and early metal fans.  &quot;Lazy&quot; is another great track (the longest on the album).  It starts out with the organ of Jon Lord, like it could be a classical piece, until Blackmore's guitar comes into the forefront and it takes a more slow bluesy direction, reaching its apex when Ian Gillan starts to sing.  Space Truckin is another great track that makes you feel like you actually are out in space.  As for the lesser known tracks, &quot;Maybe I'm a Leo, has a funky yet lovelorn vibe to it.  &quot;Pictures of Home&quot; had a somewhat midieval feel to it. &quot;Never Before&quot; had a pretty standard feel to it, while it is the shortest song on the album, it is a good one.  If you were to only get one Deep Purple album, this is it.  Made In Japan is also a good one.
B0000019PA|1.0|The instrumentation is minimal on this album - there is a strong acoustic feel mixed with some unbalanced synthesised horns that immediately start alarms ringing for the quality of this album. The singer/songwriter so-called genius thinks that subconscious ramblings, amateur melodic writing and crazy vocal slides make a cult album. He's wrong. His lyrics are resolutely abstract and leave most listeners cold - or even wondering whether he is just plain mad. It isn't clever existentialism but just outpourings of an average mind. And the singing is bizarrely uncontrolled, rough-edged, overly mournful and often just ordinary shouting. The melodies could be written by a schoolboy and the production shows no artistic effort to overcome the cheap facilities that were clearly used. If you like bad singing, bad production, repetitive guitar riffs and inane melodies then you may like this album.
B00004WG2X|3.0|I vastly prefer the A&E version of Austen's wonderful novel.  The BBC version is quite amateurish, with stagy settings and some wooden performances and doesn't do justice to the main characters.  Austen writes that Elizabeth had (forgive me, this is from memory) a lively, sportive playfulness that made it difficult for her to offend anybody.  The BBC version shows rancorous verbal exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy that belie the delicacy of the social maneuvers leading up to his mistaken belief that she is hoping to marry him.  David Rintoul plays Darcy like an insensate block.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mr. Wickham are portrayed very well in both versions, but all the characters in the A&E version are better written.<br />  The fact is that several of the reviewers object to features in the A&E version that are actually in the book!  For instance, A&E's Mrs. Bennett makes you squirm with embarrassment just as Jane Austen intended.  The BBC's Mrs. Bennett is scrubbed up and toned down. And Elizabeth does joke that she first fell in love with Darcy when she saw his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.<br />  The A&E version's view is that many aspects of life in Jane Austen's time are applicable to contemporary life--attitudes toward wealth, socioeconomics, morality (including ruthless seduction and reckless premarital sex).  The fact that Jane Austen expressed these ideas with delicacy and understatement may make them less obvious to a modern sensibility.  How do you portray a vulgar, ill-mannered or unscrupulous character from the 19th century to people raised on Roseanne, Martin Lawrence, Tony Soprano and The Fear Factor?  I think the A&E version accomplishes this beautifully without compromising the story.  The BBC version feels constricted and lifeless at times.  It's worth watching but it's neither brilliant nor the best representation of this wonderful book.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Highly riveting film with a super performance by both Russell Crowe and Ed Harris.  Even though the director changed John Nash's life a great deal to make it a more entertaining movie.<br />John Nash, a genius who came up with a business model that was adopted by many businesses, is a social oddball that is so dedicated to his studies that he has absolutely no concept of social skills.  He finds it a task to even make the slightest bit of conversation with a female.  The only person he seems to get along with is his college roomate (later we find out that this roomate is not what he seems).  His genius attracts a government agency that employs him briefly as a code breaker.  There he meets Ed Harris, who is not what he seems either.  Ed has him working on top secret work that involves breaking secret transmissions from the Russians.<br />Everything then starts to unravel and we learn the truth about the people that seem to influence John the most.<br />Crowe gives a super performance in probably the role he was born to play!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie perfectly captures the feeling of being lost in another country, with nothing to ground you. I spent 4 years teaching English in Japan, and this is the first movie I've ever seen that conveys what it's like to live there--without condescension and without snickering. (And I lived out in the countryside, which still retains more traditions than Tokyo.) The movie manages to capture the soul of Japan on screen in all its oddness, without ever making fun. There it all is: the pachinko parlors, the giant video screens, the exercise machines that talk to you, the karaoke boxes, and it all comes across as merely different, as Japan's unique adaptation of what it learned from the West. Even the quiet scenes in Kyoto, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, showed the peace and serenity that you can still find in many places in Japan. <br />Without this careful background of the viewer becoming &quot;lost&quot; in another culture from the beginning of the movie, the &quot;lost&quot; characters might have been a little too familiar. The girl who married too young; the middle-aged man facing crisis in his life. But I've seen marriages break up in Japan, and I've seen ex-pats stay for 20, 25 years, living in the demimonde that's half gai(koku)jin bars and half familiarity with everything Japanese. Things change in that neon light and circumscribed space (both physical and cultural), and Sophia Coppola does an amazing job of teasing out how you really DON'T always take yourself with you wherever you go. An incredible film. <br />P.S. For those giving this 1 or 2 stars because it's too slow, go watch old SNL reruns over and over and over.
B000060K4O|5.0|This is what a comedy movie should be about!  Four &quot;shysters&quot; that pawn themselves off as &quot;experienced&quot; experts in battling psychic phenomena, defeat a &quot;real&quot; ghost through hair-brained luck and nuclear technology.  They set up an agency that makes house calls to rid people of any supernatural baddies that may be lurking in their homes.<br />Eventually, the evil starts to build in the top of an old creepy looking apartment building.<br />Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, and Dan Ackroyd are hilarious!  Bill Murray is passable and Sigourney Weaver is hot!
B0000DBJDM|4.0|Pink Floyd was a very strange, intelligent and awesome band.<br /> I don't have any of them record but I have listened the classic albums The Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall. I have also seen The Wall-movie, which was just great. Live at Pompeii was so intresting ans pleasure experience that I will buy some Pink Floyd albums.<br />  There are original consert and director's cut consert with interviews. The original consert works just great because there are no interviews that cuts concert intensivity and feeling.<br /> In my opinion, you can't find no filler tracks in the original consert. My favourites are Echoes part 1 and Saucerful of Secrects, which shows perfectly how creative, skillful and intresting band Pink Floyd was.<br /> Mademoiselle Nobs is a song in which you can hear dog's singing.<br /> Why I don't give this dvd five stars? Because interviews are stupidly put between songs in director's cut consert. If interwiews would have put on their option, I have maybe given this dvd five stars...<br /> There are also some extras for exemple pictures and history of Pompeii. If you like Pink Floyd's early songs, you should buy this dvd immediately.

0385504209|1.0|I feel like the kid in &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes.&quot; Remember that tale? An unscrupulous tailor cons a ruler into buying invisible clothes. Everyone's standing around cooing about how great the king looks in his stylish suit.  Finally, a child cries out that His Highness is, in fact, naked.<br />In this case, the con artist is Dan Brown. The product he's peddling isn't invisible, it's just bad.<br />The story begins in a deserted museum, where an elderly curator is being stalked by a huge (are you ready for this?) albino. That's right, like in the movie with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn. But he isn't your ordinary evil albino. This one also has a mysterious accent! The rest of the chapter reads like that novel Snoopy keeps trying to write, &quot;It was a dark and stormy night... .&quot;<br />The dialogue is painful. The bad guys say things like, &quot;So, my pupil, tell me what I must know,&quot; and &quot;When we possess the keystone, we will be only one step away.&quot;<br />To paraphrase those guys on Mystery Science Theatre 3000, this is a book that has EVERYTHING -- completely wrong. Plot, character, art, history. If &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; were a movie (and Ron Howard has threatened to make it one) it would be a perfect target for Mike Nelson and his robot friends.<br />Weirdly, some major media outlets have lauded the author for the depth of his research. Taste is subjective, but facts aren't. Because of the endorsements Brown has received, a lot of readers will trust the book when it says things like, &quot;Jehovah&quot; comes from a root word that harkens back to goddess worship. Actually, Jehovah is a mistranslation of an ancient Hebrew word that scholars today render as Yahweh, which means &quot;I am that I am.&quot; Anyone who took a freshman course on Old Testament literature knows that.<br />But Brown relentlessly mangles such facts in an effort to show that Jews and Christians are stupid, and that the Catholic leadership conspired to suppress the &quot;sacred feminine.&quot; He goes on to declare that church doorways and halls are really secret architectural symbols of vaginas. Have you ever been trapped in a conversation with someone who turns everything into a phallus symbol? When you're in Brown's spiritual universe, you can't take a step without bumping your head on various parts of the female genitalia.<br />If you want to read this book, don't waste your money.

It was indeed a film before it's time and was not well accepted by audiences of the day. It has taken on more relevance now after the technological explosion of the 90s and it's legacy still echos in Hollywood 20 years later.<br />Blade Runner is a drama set in a future LA showing the struggles to survive in the oppressive technological environment of the near future. The film at it's core asks the question what is human and is it just our DNA that makes us so? I think this struggle and questions asked in the movie are becoming more and more relevant in our daily lives as we ride the explosive growth of technology over the last 20 years. I can relate in my personal life to a much greater degree to Blade Runner than any other Sci-Fi movie before or since. This is a shame that Hollywood has not done a better job raising the genre of Sci-Fi above the level of juvenile level of spaceships, aliens, and CGI effects. I think Sci-Fi can be so much more than just space ships and aliens and can teach us about ourselves by placing humans in unusual/future environments (as does Blade Runner) Granted, maybe because I work in a technical field and use a computer at least 8 hours a day Blade Runner is more compelling for me. Blade Runner has such a strong impact to me emotionally and at the same time it has a very good plot that includes, action, romance, intrigue, and life and death struggles of almost all the principle characters and their evolution as human beings. <br />This is a fascinating movie which can be watched more than once, unlike most movies in my collection which I have watched but once or twice max and have no desire to watch again for a long long time.<br />Blade Runner is an intriguing and stunning prediction of the human race's future. Will technology steal our humanity as we lose ourselves in the world of machines??? Time will tell if Blade Runner is correct in that prediction.
0385504209|1.0|If Ron Howard (a director with an excellent reputation) attempts to make this pop culture novel into a movie, he is going to need a lot of luck.  In order to make it appeal to the masses, it will be necessary to tone down the obvious anti-Catholic and anti-Christian agenda which drives the silly plot.<br />Dan Brown's &quot;research&quot; which has been exposed as little more than of the urban legend variety, will be quickly dismissed by legitimate scholars.  I suppose that could create the desired buzz, but I predict that the movie will be received much like Martin Scorcese's &quot;Last Temptation of Christ,&quot; a movie that had a much more compelling story-line, but was not exactly a blockbuster.<br />May I suggest a few options as a title for the movie:<br />&quot;Raider's of  Intelligence,&quot; &quot;Ron Howard and the Movie of Doom,&quot; or &quot;Dan Brown and His Disceptive Crusade.&quot;

1567184855|5.0|At a particular point in time, I was brought up as a Protestant Christian, and even then their idea of Heaven and the hereafter seemed greatly simplified, and plain non-sensical.  I could never buy their concept of eternal damnation for arbitrary sins, their concept of a God was just strange, etc.<br />Over the course of many years, I built up my own thoughts on what should &quot;logically&quot; be present in an afterlife, trying to keep my leaps of faith limited only to the first assumption that there is an afterlife at all.  What I had wasn't a religion at all, just a series of loosely-knit ideas on how things should work, but without anyone else coming to these conclusions it was possibly just a fine work of fiction (and so didn't lend too entirely much comfort).<br />Then I find this book, read it, and all of my assumptions, beliefs, etc are there, being mentioned by patients in deep hypnosis, only the ideas are greatly expanded apon, polished, and fit together coherently in a way I was never able manage on my own.<br />My younger brothers, my friends, everyone I care about is getting this book when they're of a proper age to understand it.  The concepts presented simply &quot;make sense&quot; to me, despite my usual skepticism, and it's less like learning information and more like remembering long-blocked information.<br />(now quit reading this review, and go stick the book in your cart!)
0425188809|4.0|I liked this book, the only problem was that I kinda knew what was going to happen around halfway through the book, although I kept on reading.  Honestly its a preatty easy read, I read it in a few days.  Don't expect anything out of this world, but you'll still find it enjoyable.  The dog is so cute, I want one.  This is in my top 5 list of &quot;fun&quot; books to read.
B00005JLR6|5.0|\\"In America\\" is a semi-autobiographical film about Jim Sheridan, acclaimed director whose works are deeply rooted in Ireland (see gripping film \\"In the Name of the Father\\").  But this time he sets his story in New York, telling about a family who just arrived there to start over their life, because of one unforgettable memory in the past.<br />The film is very episodic (partly because the script is done by three people, Jim Sheridan and his daughters Naomi and Kirsten).  It mainly shows the life of the parents, father a struggling actor and the mother supporting him.  But what is really wonderful is the two daughters played by the real life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger.  They live in a very dirty apartment where junkies are hunging around, but for the two girls it becomes a magical place, and the unlikely friendship between them and 'the Yelling Man' Mateo (great Djimon Hounsou, \\"Amistad\\"). one of the tenant, is one of the touching moment.<br />That's all you have to know.  Though the film features realiable actors like Samantha Morton (\\"Sweet and Lowdown\\") or Paddy Considine (\\"Last Resort\\"), the film's greatest virtue lies in the incredibly delightful Bolger sisters.  They are so cute and natural that even Morton cannot steal the show from them, and you know the fact from the very first scene, where one of the sisters unwittingly says an embarrassing thing which she should never say, at the immigration checkpoint.  <br />The camera (by Declan Quinn, actor Aidan's brother) is nicely captures the hot and cold air of New York (but the interior shots are all taken in the soundstage in Dublin!).  Though sometimes the film shows a lull (especially when the little sisters are not on the screen), and some part of the story are left unexplained, \\"In America\\" is a strong drama about the people coming to America with dream.  And it also does not forget the reality ... in this film, though, it changes into magic realism, thanks to the two Bolgers.  Check it out.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|ok, we live in a world of rap, hip hop, and pop music. rock had disappeared, UNTIL NOW. jet comes out of the gates with hard-core chords and amazing vocals. this Australian band, has an amazing mix of fast and slow songs, that all fit together. if you want the return of rock&amp;roll, buy Get Born or Dirty Sweep EP. you will be amazed
1410102033|5.0|The five stars are not for quality of content or ideas.  The book itself is a stylistic nightmare, full of self-indulgent, raw rage.  As any rational   human knows (hopefully) the ideas are insane and poisonous.   I could NEVER read it from cover to cover.  The sole value of this book is that it's a window into the mind of a madman.      If you read Mein Kampf, you'll wonder how anyone could have followed someone who was obviously insane. The content of Hitler's ideas would be laughable, if not for the fact that people did take this stuff seriously. His ramblings are full of raw, angry, verbose garbage that force a rational person to cringe.  At one time there were people who thought that his ideas were great.  And there are the few who still do, a fact which is frightening to anyone capable of logical thinking.  Mein Kampf is a journey into a deluded, twisted mind, a journey that isn't exacly enjoyable.  It is, however, necessary to understand the depths to which humans can sink.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|The more I listen to this album, the further it takes me.  I have been a DT fan since the first album in 1989, and this one is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  I have to admit that the first time I played it through, I wasn't sold on it.  I thought it was good, but not necessarily great.  However, it has grown on me tremendously, and now I can't get enough.  It's been a long time since I've heard an album with this kind of balls.  It's heavy, in some cases downright ferocious, but not just for the sake of being heavy.  It's got some real groove to it.  I know a lot of people seem to think they have taken a step backwards with this one, but I disagree.  I like the fact that each new DT album is a different experience, and I think this album simply represents another piece of what this band is.  I hope they continue to redefine themselves with every album to keep things fresh and exciting.  Good job guys.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Let me say straight off that I have never played Resident Evil (I don't get the time). I found this movie to be great fun with a shocking opening. I can't believe the opening isn't listed as being scary. I mean think about it, you're just getting ready to go home and the fire alarm goes off, you try to leave but you're sealed in and about to get dosed with Halon gas. I watched the opening sequence and it chilled me, because at the time you don't know who's deliberately killing the workers. Then we meet Alice (BTW no-one names her) who suffers amnesia. From then we get into the Hive and the horror that awaits. <br />I enjoyed this movie and found it moderately jumpy without being a gorefest (I don't like proper gore flicks). To the reviewer who asked why Milla is running around in a red evening dress, I have to ask: Did you watch the movie? It's made quite plain that she puts the dress on because it is laid out ready on the bed and she doesn't get the chance to change. <br />So it didn't go everywhere like the game, well to be blunt, that works in a game but in a film, it would look patchy and disjointed. All in all I liked this film, Milla is sexy and kick..., Michelle is moody and tough and the sounndtrack rocks. Can't wait for the sequel.
B0000028M7|5.0|As many reviewers here stated, this is Alice in Chains' most popular and most consistent effort. The band has finally found its vision of music, and succeeded in doing everything right. The songwriting is excellent here, with necessary variety yet keeping the general feel intact. As usual, Jerry Cantrell's downtuned guitar is in the center of AIC recognizable sound. He puts out sludgy heavy riffs, or some beautiful acoustics, or peculiar solos, and keeps the highest quality in every note. Bluesy edge, with references to Led Zeppelin, can clearly be heard in most songs.<br />The voice of Layne Staley puts emotions into songs. His performance varies in style, always staying strong. With most of lyrics based on drug-related issues, this is not the easiest listen. With Layne's death songs like &quot;Rain When I Die&quot;, &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; or &quot;Junkhead&quot; got the whole new perspective. It's almost unbearable to listen to a man, who recognizes his deadly habit and his own inability to combat it. Though far from usual misery of doom-metal, Alice in Chains' style puts a listener in depression and hopelessness like no other band.<br />Tough not all of the songs here are to my liking (I find hard to get into &quot;God Smack&quot; and &quot;Hate to Feel&quot;), the quality of this music is superb, and makes for a highly recommended purchase. This is one of those records that forever will represent the spirit of grunge.<br />PS By the way, Tom Araya from thrashing giants &quot;Slayer&quot; provides guest performance here. His powerfull yelling is part of the unnamed intro track before &quot;Hate to Feel&quot;.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Could not buy this one as it is too heavy for me.  They are really going into inharmonic metal this time.  I find their side projects OSI and Frameshift a lot better than this.<br />Maybe they want to reach a bigger public and incorporate all the metal fans.<br />I just bought concert ticket and hope they spend more time on previous album than on this one.<br />(...) BUT THEY GAVE AN EXCELLENT SHOW WITH THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT TOUR, BY FAR THE BEST SHOW I SAW SO FAR.  5 STARS FOR THE SHOW.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just buy it! Whedon is a genius. Incredible twists of plot, great character development. If you liked the series in its brief tenure on Fox, you will love the DVDs which give you the segments in the intended order (makes far more sense!). This series had so much potential--can't wait to see what Joss will do with the movie! Can I give it ten stars?
B0000067L2|5.0|their best cd. contains everything a rock fan needs. bluesy (obvious with clapton) and phycodelic kicks this album into rocks top 10.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Don't let a travesty go unscathed! If you love Firefly and are in utter horror that it's canceled tell Fox! Tell them twice, just tell them! Maybe we'll get a movie, maybe a show. Go to Fox.com and look for an email drop-box. Go ahead, be mean!<br />At LEAST they may finally realize that airing them out-of-order, and NOT airing the three BEST episodes was in fact, ASININE. The pilot is actually pretty terrible (as most can be), but the evolution of the others is impeccable and even becomes a sheer masterpiece (as one might gather from these reviews). So believe it, you won't be dissappointed with this set and then you too, will be in horror, yet glad to have something rather than nothing at all..
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Almost all trilogys has suffered of the third chapter curse. What is that? A sucessfull trilogy dissapoint a bunch of people with its end, take the classic Star Wars trilogy for example, \\"The Return Of The Jedi\\" is not a bad movie but is not good as the other two, \\"Back To The Future - Part III\\" is the same thing... What i'm trying to say is that Revolutions is not a bad film, but it could be a loooooot better. I will list here the things that I think are wrong in the film: 1- The battle between men and machines for Zion, in the beggining you think: Wow, tht's cool. But after some 15 minutes of shots and explosions, it gets boring! 2- Did someone forgot to finish the script? What an ending is that? Can we have a little bit more of explanations? Why do we have to think in ours own teories? Give an end to the bloody film! 3- A very short final fight. The final confrontation between Neo and Smith is a great scene but...it's too short! It lasts more or less 6 minutes! 4- The real world sucks! Revolutions has 80% of its scenes on the \\"real world\\", it is so not cool... We want that cool Matrix style not  a lot of ruins! Is the curse attacking again... Only in december 2003, the curse was broken with the more than excellent \\"The Lord Of The Rings - The Return Of The King\\", I just hope not to be disapointed again...
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I do, I love this soundtrack, but I couldn't help realizing how much the music for the end credits and the music coinciding with Jack and Barbosa's fight sound EXACTLY like the Battle music in Gladiator, which was also produced by Zimmer.<BR>It makes it very comical when trying to picture the scenes from Pirates, and then all of a sudden Russell Crowe goes running through the scene dressed as a gladiator .  (Even Jack and Barbosa can't help but do a double take!)  And if you don't believe me, give number 3 on the Gladiator soundtrack a listen... and you'll see how similar the music is.  (chuckle)<BR>This soundtrack is good, the music for the Black Pearl is my favorite, very ominous stuff.  I agree the track listing needs a nudge into their proper titles, but all together, if your a soundtrack buff, this one should be part of your collection one day.

1869504917|2.0|I cannot believe that this book lacks the single most obvious thing that such a book should have - A MAP OF THE LOCATIONS DESCRIBED!!  There is one giant map of NZ, with a few cities on it.  And there are a small handful of zoomed-in maps of a few given locations.  But what there logically should be is a map of NZ, showing where these locations are!  Very frustrating thing to leave out.<br />Other than that, the book provides pretty much everything else one might need: descriptions, pictures, some limited information on reaching the places (very limited), and even GPS coordinates.  But the lack of maps, and the limited directions, make this book lacking in a big way.
B00005JGAB|4.0|The Ramones were a fun pop/rock band (like ? &amp; Mysterians, Tommy James &amp; Shondells, Troggs, the Seeds, Paul Revere &amp; Raiders) who never had a hit record, and were seldom heard on the radio (unlike ? &amp; Mysterians, Tommy James &amp; Shondells, Troggs, the Seeds, Paul Revere &amp; Raiders.)  Sure, they were a bit louder (they came 10 years after the other mentioned bands, when amps went up to 11) and had the cool matching punk look of haircuts and black leather jackets (Iggy Pop called it the muppet look.) But really, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot; or &quot;Judy is a Punk&quot; are nice tunes, I'll admit. But so was &quot;96 Tears&quot; by ? &amp; Mysterians; &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; by Tommy James &amp; Shondells; &quot;Wild Thing&quot; by Troggs; &quot;Pushin' Too Hard&quot; by the Seeds; and &quot;Just Like Me&quot; and &quot;Kicks&quot; by Paul Revere &amp; Raiders.  So what exactly makes the Ramones a legendary punk band, and those other groups just forgotten footnotes?  To mention the Ramones in the same sentence as the Beatles, Stones or Who (as many of their die-hard fans do) is ridiculous.  I'd rather mention them in the same sentence as the Bay City Rollers (who Johnny Ramone admitted they wanted to be), Paul Revere &amp; Raiders, and ? &amp; Mysterians.  Wish there were some honest reviews of this band.  I liked their first album, used to play it a lot.  But the Ramones never should have been elected to the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame before bands like Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, or Deep Purple.     I've had my say.
B0001CNRSE|4.0|Audiences' enjoyed Honey worldwide. The way that Jessica Alba expressed her character Honey thru dancing was also nice. The relationship that Honey and her mother had was average; on the other hand her mother didn't want Honey's life to be all about  dancing. What her mother was doing without knowing was helping to create a better dancer out of Honey. When the celebrities were in the movie they did a nice job. Missy Elliot really brought her character to life. She was funny and had much attitude. When the children were dancing at the end, it showed how much Honey put her heart and soul into what she believed. I would of liked to see more of the end. I wanted to see what happened with Honey and all the dancers. There should have been forty-five minutes of life after they got the money. Overall I enjoyed the movie, I would encourage others to check it out also.
B00009RDGA|4.0|This is a very fine DVD of Peter Bogdanovich's early '70s film. The plot revolves around a con man  (Ryan O'Neal) who unexpectedly has a young girl (an Oscar-winning Tatum O'Neal) come into his care. He starts out driving her across Kansas to her family, but the two become partners and travel throughout the Midwest making money. <BR>Both O'Neals are excellent, but what really makes this movie is the way that Bogdanovich and his team used black and white cinematography and production design to make the setting (Depression era Kansas) believeable. The praries are wide, the streets are bare, and the actors playing small town Kansans are suitably taciturn. The bond between the two O'Neals is never sentimentalized, and while Tatum may not be a great actress, her directness works well for the part. There's also an outstanding supporting performance by Madeline Kahn as a dancer the two travelers encounter along the way. Kahn and Tatum have a beautiful little scene together on a hillside where they both acknowledge that the other is on the make. The DVD includes commentary by Bogdanovich and some interesting featurettes. <BR>Highly recommended.
B000066NW0|2.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album is a cheesy, extremely shallow pop cd. It's catchy, of course (The choruses are bound to stay in your head for das after the first listen), and her vocals are unique and quirky, but the lyrics are the most immature, akward lines I can think of. The &quot;deeper&quot; she tries to be, the plainer and more moronic it gets. I found the album average and boring.
0385510438|5.0|In my experience, Grisham either writes excellent books (The Chamber, The Runaway Jury) or very mediocre ones (The Client, which is possibly the most pointless thing I have read in years.) The blurb of The Last Juror - which tells of a small Southern town, a rape and murder trial, a defendant send down despite threatening revenge if the jurors convict him, and a \\"retribution\\" 9 years later upon his release - makes it sound a very promising thriller, and I was expecting to read what might be Grisham's best book. However, the blurb is slightly misleading in its focus and its suggestion of time. Indeed, the trial doesn't happen until about halfway through, and the release not until about the final 50 pages. As I realised this, I changed my expectation to disappointment. Big but: I was very wrong. Because, in spite of that, this is STILL probably Grisham's finest novel. <br />While it is  partly about the trial and conviction of local boy Danny Padgitt, The Last Juror is actually about the town as a whole and how it changes over time, through desegregation and other social shifts. It's about it's eclectic residents and how they cope with the changes and crimes in the community, as seen through the eyes of the dubiously-named Willie Traynor, one of Grisham's most engaging narrators in years, a 23 year-old journalist who has recently acquired ownership of the Ford Count Times, and gradually turns its fortunes around as he writes with endearing passion about the town, and anger at the corruption in its justice system. The journey Grisham takes us on, through the panorama of 9 years in the history of this town in the seventies, is a wonderful, touching, and also thrilling, and The Last Juror is a wonderful, touching and thrilling book. <br />There is an inexplicable tendency, even among fans of the crime genre, to look down on Grisham and other huge populists, and it is a tendency which is denying lots of people some great reading experiences. His books aren't particularlychallenging, no, but he is a brilliant and instinctive storyteller. His prose is so easy and languid, so polished, that it flows past the eyes and invites one simply to be carried along with the ease of the experience. It is remarkable prose, unlike anyone else's. Thus, his books don't require much effort to read, but the rewards of a captivating, entertaining story are copious and potent for the fact that his books asks so little - apart from a little emotional investment in his characters - and give, comparatively, so much.<BR> <BR>Grisham's books tend to be very plot driven, but this one also puts a bit more focus on characters; a quirky and warming bunch. The town colourful inhabitants are drawn, on the surface, wonderfully, even if there is no real depth to some of them. They are an unthreatening, entirely innocuous group, a personification, almost, of Grisham's approach to his books. It's sometimes remarkable to think that in the gratuitous world of crime writing, Grisham's books are never ever brutal, and in all his back-catalogue he's only ever \\"murdered\\" about 7 people. <br />In the end, this is a great legal thriller with some nice twists, but more than that it is a compelling meditation on the life of a small American town in the 70's. In the very moving final chapter, Grisham's message seems to be that the only person who sits in on our final judgement, our own last juror, is ourselves. Or God, depending upon what you believe, I suppose.
B00013PHGS|5.0|&quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; takes up where the now classic &quot;Moon Safari&quot; left off, taking chill-out music to an all new level.  When I first got this baby I was relieved that it wasn't the disappointment that &quot;10,000 MZ Legend&quot; was.  The boys from Air have created 10 absolutely gorgeuos songs that are sure to move and groove you in ways you never thought possible--and I ain't talking about on the dance floor either.  Air maintains their &quot;psychedelica&quot; appeal with strong crossover potential, especially with songs like &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot;, &quot;Universal Traveler&quot; (personal fave) and &quot;Surfin' on a Rocket&quot;.  Really, every song here is a stand out, and is sure to impress even the most critical Air fan.

B00013PHGS|5.0|Talkie Walkie is currently one of the best electronica CDs out today. It ranks right up there with the Chemical Brother's &quot;Singles&quot; and mr.deviant's &quot;Techno Obsession&quot;. On this CD Air takes a very light and emotional approach to the song writing. Listeners will also be glad to hear that this CD has no filler. The CD was written as one good album, instead of writing one or two good songs (like every pop act today) and padding the rest of the CD with tripe and rushed music. Hands down, Talkie Walkie is one of the best albums of 2004 and is Grammy bound in 2005!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Amazing production! This is one of those few movies that actually make you think. Even if you don't like the story line, the production makes up for it. Of all the movies I've seen, this one is in my top 5.

B00004BZ16|5.0|I'm sorry.  The reviewers who want to defend the &quot;artistic vision&quot; of SANDINISTA! have a tin ear.  I want to argue that this album is a bad album that contains a masterpiece.  That is the consensus, and I think it is correct.  For the vast majority of Clash fans, the only acceptable approach to this album is to create one's own anthology.  Take the CDs, pick the individual cuts that you find essential, and stick with just those.  You will end up with a disc that contains approximately two-fifths of the original album.  Which songs to include will depend upon one's particular taste.  Certain songs are beyond debate, and constitute some of the greatest songs in the Clash's catalog:  &quot;The Magnificent Seven,&quot; &quot;Hitsville U.K.,&quot; &quot;Someone Got Murdered,&quot; &quot;Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice),&quot; the amazing &quot;Police on My Back,&quot; and the great anti-war anthem &quot;The Call Up.&quot;  These are not good but great song, and easily withstand comparison to the best on THE CLASH and LONDON CALLING.  But unfortunately many of the cuts are simply god awful schlock.<br />History is replete with artists who are not able to exercise sufficient self-discipline to hone their work to perfection.  Thomas Wolfe wrote fascinating prose, but it took Maxwell Perkins to pare it down into something readable.  But too many artists succumb to the idea that more is more, while often less really is more.  Those who want you to listen to the entire album do the genuinely great songs on it an injustice.  I think of the famous anecdote concerning Michelangelo.  Upon buying some marble from the quarry, he selected a piece that he insisted contained an angel, and that he had to let it out.  Similarly, this album contains a masterpiece, but it is the responsibility of everyone owning both it and a CD recorder to pare it down to one exceedingly good disc.  Someone who insists on the album in its entirety is in the grip of an idea, an idea that does not naturally arise from listening to it from beginning to end.does not naturally arise from listening to it from beginning to end.
1561008206|3.0|I'm a longtime Persuasion fan, and know the novel well.  I bought the Brilliance Audio edition because it's tough to find unabridged versions and I like hearing my favorite old stories aloud.<br />The tapes are certainly sturdy for repeated library lendings, and the narrator is easy to hear and understand, but otherwise Michael Page is the wrong reader for this story!  His vocal characterizations are quavery and pinched, and don't usually fit the characters--or degrade them to farce level.  The music signalling the end of each cassette is distracting, jarring even.<br />Not a great reading of Persuasion.  Not even a good intro to the novel for first timers, and terrible for those of us who know the characters already.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I got my hands on a copy, and since no review sites got their hands on it, I figured this was a good as place as any to air out my opinions on what's the deal with this release...<br />First off, <BR>The only perceptible thing about this DVD that says recall, is my copy has a messed up Scene Selections menu.  When you arrive at the Scene selection screen, it comes up blank.  Only after you select a highlight on the blank screen will something appear on it.  <br />Presentation:<BR>The DVD is a VERY clean transfer.  Bit rate ranges from high 4's to high 7's.  I know how freaky black levels get on DVD's, and this one does a bang up job with the material.  <br />The audio is good too.  It does stay kinda front heavy, only filling surround on score and on a few scenes where incedental SoundFX (like Bela's dogs barking...)  This isn't the movie you whip out to impress the friends with your setup, but it is very balanced for the feature.  Ed never got to do a 5.1 mix, so it's only fair... :)<br />I've only given a small glance at the extras, but all of them are fairly intriguing, with the Theramin one being a full on lesson on how to best play it.  The directors commentary is full of informative facts regarding the production's following reality and how it strays from it for embellishment's sake.  They stayed pretty true...<br />Overall, if the bad menu was the only REAL reason it was pulled, they've got some really lousy product testers...<br />Bad menu aside, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
B000003TA4|3.0|In the midst of power-chord infested ballads, huge hair, sex and drugs, and nothing but a good ol' time - came flannel shirts, long hair, and teen-angst. I really must agree with Sebastian Bach (singer of Skid Row) when he says \\"The song 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' really was the icing on the cake for glam metal\\". In a way, this was a good thing, because it stopped horrible bands like Dangerous Toyz or Dokken making it huge like Poison or the Crue, and brought along excellent bands like Alice In Chains. But the most popular, well-known grunge band is Nivana. I never understood that, because Alice In Chains were so much better. Nirvana had musical potential, but never lived up to it. After this album came out, I found myself missing the likes of Twisted Sister, Poison and Skid Row. This album is very raw and agressive - and I like raw, agressive music - but this really never cought my ear. I really enjoy Teen Spirit and Polly Wants a Cracker, and a few others - but other than that, this album never really appealed to me. Too much teen-angst, droning and moaning. Kurt Cobain was a good lyricist, but never brought it too full potential. Even being as catchy as it is, this album gets very old and repetitve very, very fast. But God Bless Kurt Cobain and what he did for the music industry. I would check out the many bands of Dave Grohl, however. The man is genious. Queens of the Stone Age is one of my top 10 favorite bands, and Foo Fighters are good as well.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Most of the LET IT BE album was not butchered by Phil Spector. Only &quot;Let It Be,&quot; &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; &quot;I Me Mine&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; had his overdubbed choir. The rest of the songs on LET IT BE...NAKED sound pretty much identical to the original CD release. But the idea for the second disc, FLY ON THE WALL is clever. The entire CD has only one track, which is twenty-two minutes long. It is an interesting look at the way The Beatles interacted together in the studio and has snippets of songs. <BR>All in all, it isn't an essential purchase like 1 or the ANTHOLOGY albums, but it's still a worthy effort.

If you don't, don't feel pressured to conform to his descriptions in your pursuit of happiness. Just because it says Ph.D. after his name does not necessarily mean that his opinions are correct. They may work for some people but don't force the issue if the shoe just doesn't fit because this is anything but a \\"one size fits all\\" book. <br />This book's descriptions of men and women and it's philosophies for finding harmony and happiness are biased in favor of men.  Here's how it works. Essentially, if the man decides to enter his \\"cave\\" then there isn't one single thing the woman can do and, from John Gray's perspective, the same thing is true for the man. It's simply a time when only one course of action - leaving the man alone - will solve anything. Though it is true that, when people are edgy, they may need some space. Still, Gray says that it happens all the time for men and that they just can't help it. Though it may also be true that sometimes people need some alone time just for its own sake, still, Gray's philosophy, if bought into by a couple, can easily lead to the man misusing the idea of the \\"cave\\" to justify unnecessary and even selfish distancing which may actually hurt the relationship in the long run. <br />Gray does use some humor and clever metaphors to put forth his points, but, just because you laugh or find a metaphor easy to understand does not necessarily mean that you are being taught correct ideas. If you read this book, be skeptical.
B00007BK2N|5.0|BRILLIANT!Here we have an elegy that chronicles the glory days of the Manchester music scene.  Manchester was to new wave what Seattle was to grunge. Tony's Wilson's quip, &quot;I'm post-modern before it's fashionable&quot; adequately sums it all up.  This movie shows us what was magical about Manchester without posturing or being self-serving.  It appeared to be a truly accurate and informative look at the creative zeitgeist that fueled this lower-middle-class British city.I recommed Joy Division's SUBSTANCE as a companion CD for this movie.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I have to preface this review by noticing how many people have trashed this movie because it went nowhere. Hmmmmm. That's just inability to relate. I can say that I have been almost all the people in this movie. Like Bob Harris, I am now middle-aged, have made many of the choices he has made in life and been dealt the consequences. I have actually been to Japan and experienced the hyper-artificial texture of the culture there. And I have met women several years my junior while trapped in hotels for three or four days at a time and can say that it is entirely plausible for love to be implanted, bloom and fade in the time that it takes to check in and check out.<br />Okay, having said all that, I think I can objectively say that this movie is going to be an all-time classic. If \\"Sex Lies and Videotape\\" became the most influential indie film of the 1990s, then \\"Lost In Translation\\" will probably spawn 100 bad May-December love stories posing as independent film. This movie, in fact, could have easily collapsed under the weight of lesser talent. It's all about Bill Murray's performance, which is funny and heartbreaking. Scarlett Johannson comes out of nowhere to complete the chemistry. I don't know what made Sofia Coppola cast these two, but I can imagine other actors that would have wrecked the movie with overacting or an inability to grasp the story. Imagine Dustin Hoffman and Julia Stiles. Or Alec Baldwin and Kirstin Dunst. Or Harrison Ford and Jessica Alba. There are bigger, handsomer male leads than Murray and more beautiful and talented young actresses than Johannson, but this movie's sex appeal is generated mostly above the neck and between the ears. Much has been written about Murray's karaoke scenes, but I guarantee that Johannson will steal your heart singing the Pretenders' \\"Brass In Pocket.\\" I am now in the process of renting every movie she's been in.
0156027321|4.0|Survival stories are always intriguing because one is always second guessing what they would do in that particular situation.  This story about a teen boy stranded with various zoo animals seemed to way out there to bother with.  In fact, I must have picked up this book and put it back down in the bookstore 20 times before I decided to buy it.<br />Pi is a great character.  His extraordinary faith in religion was endearing to me as a nonbeliever though never made me want to go in that direction.  The author did a great job at developing Pi as a charcter.<br />The book can be divided into three sections.  The first section is where you get to know Pi as a human being.  I really enjoyed this part of the book.  Pi is the type of character you really want to come out on top.  The second part of the book is Pi and the castaways survival at sea.  As mentioned I like survival stories so this part of the book was probably my favorite.  The third section of the book deals with Pi basically retelling his story to the company that owned the boat that sunk.  I came away a little empty here.  Sure, make what you will with what 'really' happened but I think that the book fell flat here.<br />All in all The Life of Pi is definately a better than average book.
B00005JMEW|5.0|5 stars just isn't enough to rate this future classic...and this is only the first half!!!! I had the luxury of seeing this work of art in theatersand it kept me on the edge of my seat from The Bride's first showdown in the suburbs to the restaraunt to the garden fight toward the end where heads literally roll. and I thought that the courtyard catfight in CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON was awesome but this blew me away. Buy this masterpiece if you can and a message for Mr. Tarantino: Let's see this beauty made into a game for the PS2 or Xbox. you know i'd be first in line even if I have to steal a line from another Tarantinno masterpiece \\"get medieval on someone's ass\\"

0142000663|5.0|Interpretation of great American literature usually requires some perspective...indeed one must have lived a large portion of life to fully appreciate it's hardships. This philosophy is never more evident than when considering John Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. At once a testament to human fortitude while also a study for the historian to obtain a more humanistic perspective on the Great Depression, Steinbeck achieves a sort of literary pantheon with this timeless classic.<br />This is the story of the everyday mid-western crop farmer during the great &quot;dust-bowl&quot; tragedy of the Depression. Forced by economic and personal factors to disband their farms and land (leaving generations of family history behind), they head to California to start anew with the promise of economic stability. Alas, this notion is soon discovered to be false as life there becomes even more destitute than the one that they have just left. Steinbeck's fictitious Joad family most assuredly mirrors the many similar groups that actually made this treck across a suddenly barren mid-western United States. Hardships and sorrows accrue as their savings run out and the promise of work becomes an ever lengthening ideal. Steinbeck presents a tome that emphatically enforces this personal sorrow while maintaining a fast paced novel thats unique in literary circles. Historical accuracy is never compromised as Steinbeck keeps the State and Federal governments' skewed Depression Era's economic policies at the forefront of the story and shows how these mis-guided actions indirectly become the driver for Franklin Roosevelts &quot;New Deal&quot; policies.<br />The overriding virtue of this work, however, is Steinbeck's ability to take the reader along and make him a part of the story. Time and again, I truly felt the compelling sadness and overwhelming desperation of the Joads plight and when this is coupled with the  incredible &quot;readability&quot; of the story, one can see why this work has long been considered &quot;the great American novel&quot;. Having half-heartedly read this in high-school, I'd submit that it should be re-read by those who now have families and responsibilities...a new appreciation will most assuredly be gained and I give this my highest recommendation.work has long been considered &quot;the great American novel&quot;.

B00000DC10|5.0|This is without a doubt the best hardcore album ever recorded.  Unfortunately, I don't think it will ever be the shape of punk to come considering the shape that punk rock is in today.  It is a shame that this band broke up, but hopefully someday some band will pick up where they left off.
B000088E6D|4.0|He has a nice voice. I listen to this when I want to unwind. His CDs has given me an interest in the music of the 50s era (I'm a child of the 80s)...I give him 4 stars because of the background singers in track 5; they just don't seem to fit with the song.
B00005BJ9W|1.0|I have the original &quot;Rio&quot; on vinyl from '82 and it is a tremendous pop-rock album. Unfortunately, someone decided to butcher these songs when they put them on cd. Why did they shorten the songs? It's like audio cliff notes. Am i the only person who notices this? Who even cares? I've bought two different versions of this recording on cd and both feature shortened\edited songs. Someone lied; this is not the original recording.

0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones has proven to be a worthy read. A young girl raped and murdered by a weird neighbor and whose body was never recovered left permanent pain in her family. Sounds pretty much like a ordinary storyline. But not, Alice Sebold does more by weaving in the afterlife. The obvious challenge here is to make a believable tale which also is meaningful.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones not only succeeds at that but also achieves depth and emotions that are bound to tug a few hearts. Ultimately, the protaganist, from heaven, discovers the meaning of her shortlived existence on Earth, learns to cope with her own untimely death and more importantly, how to let go, which also is the central theme of the book.<br /><br />What the book really strives to do is to remind us that all of us have a life to live no matter what happens. For the bereaved, the death of a loved one brings much pain and heartbreak, but also with it, plenty of cherished memories that cannot be erased. Learning to let go is almost insurmountable, but as you learn from the book that if you do, life goes on and gets better.<br /><br />Along the way, you'll learn much of her life's important lessons told in the most sublime and endearing manner. It's thoroughly enjoyable and especially so if you have lost a loved one before. Alice Sebold makes the story so real that you might be mistaken that heaven is on earth.<br /><br />For those who found this book a good read, try Mitch Albom's the Five People You Meet In Heaven.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my favorite movie. Read the book in high school and we watched a little snippet of it. I am elated there is a DVD edition. It's made a Colin Firth fan out of me :)
B00005UKE0|5.0|1970 was a great year, perhaps the last great year for my taste, with George's spirituality and Clapton's romantic love both so openly displayed on their respective albums, both sharing the old Delaney and Bonnie rhythm section. George's voice is perfect here, kind of what I'd imagine Dylan to sound like if he were a little less cold-blooded, but still not sappy, and Clapton always does his sweetly melodic best over George's chord progressions. In spite of George's worries, the Phil Spector production holds up as classic.   (Clapton was uncredited for all of Beatles/Harrison work until this version; in return, was George perhaps an uncredited player on 'Layla'? Much of it would seem so.) (For those who aren't familiar with Delaney Bramlett, bear in mind that the concept of 'finger-picky,lead/rhythms' that Eric uses often here and during this period in general were learned from DB, and so, for more than just supplying the band, I don't believe that 'All Things Must Pass' or 'Layla' would have existed in the form they do without Delaney's strong influence.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is one of the few CDs I can listen to without skipping tracks. My favorites are Oceano, Mi Mancherai, Si Volvieras a Mi, Remember When It Rained, Caruso, and Per Te. Mi Morena, from the limited edition, is also one of my favorites. He is truly a class act.
B0000CFW87|3.0|Josh, you sure can sing...this we are all agreed on. But pul-eeze, take some risks before you fade into obscurity. Challenge that magnificent voice we all love....sing something that really, really makes us say WOW. This CD is nice, yes, and safe...and dare I say, boring. Yawn. Do something crazy on your next CD...collaborate with some popular artists that we would love to hear your voice marry with...do something different....your voice can handle anything.....who is giving you career advice? Is that advice to never stray from the standard elevator music formula? You are 22 years old...this doesn't have to be your trademark....you are too young for this to be all we get from you....shake it up baby!

B0000AUHPK|5.0|Well, i can't get enough of this film. Angst, unrequited love, heart broken breakdowns and all that with Juliette B to boot: where can you go wrong?<br />Sadly, in England.  &quot;We don't like her French accent&quot; the poms moaned, despite her having voiced the entire film in her second language,, and thankfully without a grating Yorkshire brogue or even worse, a Valleygirl whine.  No, really there is nothing wrong with Ms Binoche at all, neither in looks, acting, nor voice. <br />And Raif ! now you're a superstar, but back then you were just a moody young thing - and perfect for the part.<br />Scenery is great - music was haunting - direction, as usual, was superb. Kosminsky is probably my favourite director, but he's only done 2 films you might have seen in America - the rest were in England, released over the years. Worth migrating for that alone...
B000099T3P|3.0|Ah, Critters. I saw this movie along with it's other sequels a number of years ago and liked them for the most part. This and Critters 2 came on back to back on HBO recently and of course I wanted to see them again. Well on to the review of Critters. Let me start off by saying that this movie is geared more toward teenagers and adults may rate this as a typical &quot;B movie&quot;. I won't ruin the plot for anyone who hasn't seen Critters so I'll just say that if you like a dark sci-fi with a bit of humor than you may want to check this out.

0312263120|3.0|The DaVinci Code was my first exposure to Dan Brown and I looked forward to reading Digital Fortress.  His writing combines a great deal of thought provoking ideas and conspiracy theories.<BR>Digital Fortress is about a computer genius gone mad.  You've heard the story before and this one follows the pattern.  However, if you enjoy the technological aspects of the book, you will enjoy the storyline also.  It's a fun read and one that will entertain you for a few hours but don't expect anything new.

If you want something with DaVinvi's name on it try looking in an art history book. it's just a whole load of crap. don't bother spending all that money - because (like me) it will just piss you off and for all the uneducated beings - they will beleive what they read and think they are smart and start passing off false information...

B0000C8AQM|5.0|A great rockin' movie like &quot;School Of Rock&quot; deserves a great rockin' soundtrack, and such this CD is. Who can say no to an album that has classic tunes by The Who, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Cream, AND Stevie Nicks? Certainly not me! And, as an added bonus, the two songs by film stars Jack Black &amp; the schoolkids (under their group name, the School Of Rock) are just as awesome. What more needs to be said? If you're a fan of classic rock music, then you've just *gotta* pick up the &quot;School Of Rock&quot; movie soundtrack. And don't forget to pick up the movie on DVD as well---it's a total keeper, just like this excellent soundtrack CD.

0345440900|2.0|As the first-time mother of a three month old boy I always keep an eye opened for books that are highly recommended. I must admit I was eager to read this one, as I had heard a lot of 'rave reviews' about it. <BR> Let me first start by saying that this book has many good points, but also a few that had me rolling my eyes. Among Tracy Hogg's good points are discussions about learning to differentiate between a baby's cries and methods to avoid when putting a baby to sleep.  <BR> Tracy Hogg is apparently a registered midwife and nurse in her homeland, England. Throughout most of the book she uses examples of parents and their babies that she has worked with. In two such examples she discusses babies who could not sleep in their cribs, because they were 'scared'. Her big remedy in both these cases was to pick up and comfort the babies. At that point I was getting bored, as I have been doing that with my son from day one. <BR> However I found myself shaking my head in disbelief and apprehension when I read that she had done this with one baby 126 times in one night! I don't know of anyone who has the patience or energy to do that all night (let alone count how many times you are actually doing it!) Unless the author herself comes to my house I think I'll heed her advice with a grain of salt. <BR> Save your money and use your common sense. There is nothing in here I haven't read in other parenting books. This book was certainly disappointing.
B00006LPEY|5.0|Okay, I'm sure many of you saw this movie so I will not go into details about this movie. First of all, there are many version of Akira in DVD..Special Edition etc. I have seen the special edition DVD of this movie and there are lots of cool extra features..like making of etc. But only fuss I had about the Special Edition is that there is no Japanese dialouge in 5.1 surround sound. So if you want some kind of surround sound experience of Akira, you only have English Language version.<br />Finally, Pioneer release Japanese 5.1 DTS version of Akira, and I had no idea until I thought it was time for me to buy Akira in DVD. I got this in a heart beat even though it did not have any special features..because well, I seen them all.<br />Anyway, The picture quality of this movie is same as the one you will see from the special edition. Basically, the pictures are awesome! Now, the sound...this is way the AKira meant to be watched and heard. Original Japanese Language is to way to go. This dvd also has the New English Dubbed surround Dolby, but I really don't care about that. Once you watch it with Original Japanese surround sound, you know you got the right DVD of Akira.<br />Oh, you must beware, the sound is in DTS format, not dolby! So if you don't have right dvd player and reciever, you will not get any sound! Make sure your dvd player and reciever, which ever, is dts ready.<br />And lastly, the cover of this dvd is awesome. It shines!
B000092ZYX|5.0|I dunno what happened to bring out all the bad reviews for this album lately...<br />I disliked this album too, because I didn't have a clear view of it at first. After the initial 2 or 3 listens you start to develop a sort of vision of the album as a whole. What I didn't realize is that I felt the same way about Amnesiac and Kid A when I first heard them, and it doesn't seem like I learned my lesson. <br />&quot;2+2=5&quot; &quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot; &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up&quot; &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; &quot;Backdrifts&quot; &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; &quot;There There&quot; &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot; and &quot;Wolf at the Door&quot; are all brilliant tracks, and it pains me to think of how I didn't notice their brilliance before. The other tracks shine less, admitingly, but I don't think there's one song on this album that is less than good. <br />Please give it a try. Some people give up too easily.
B00011RPB0|3.0|There were 6 minutes of previews at the beginning of this DVD which you are forced to watch because the DVD wont allow you to skip ahead to the main menu. Despite my mood being soured by the previews at the beginning of the DVD I enjoyed the movie.
0156027321|5.0|EXCELLENT BOOK YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY, yup, thats what I thought, it was that gooooood!!! Read It!!
0156027321|5.0|I was totally captivated by this book. Every aspect of it felt real, and considering the premise, one could imagine this book spinning wildly into fantasy. Martel always seems to know just how much physical detail to give to make the emotional story resonate. Simply brilliant. Highly recommended.
0380977788|5.0|This is the first time EVER that I have read ANYTHING by Neil Gaiman. I bought the book because it had a creepy cover and I liked the book description. Having never read any books by him, I was not sure what I would find. What I found was complete eye candy! I absolutely LOVED reading this book. I read it in one hour and then when I was finished, I started reading it again. This book gave me chills, especially, the description of the \\"other\\" peoples' button eyes. This book was well illustrated but my imagination took me to those dark places all too well. <br />This book is great...I highly recommend it and it is not only for children. So many childrens books these days are not only intended for children. This is one of them.<br />You can be sure, I will be buying other books by this author. I am glad I happened upon him. It is not every day that one comes upon such an imaginative author such as Neil Gaiman.
6304383177|5.0|I have watched this classic movie more times than I can remember and I have laughed each time. The jokes, the physical and verbal comdey, and the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant are a delicious mix. I enjoy older films, but this movie is recommended to anyone who likes a good comedy. It is infinitely better than some of today's lame comedies and gives you a fresh, enjoyable, side-splitting laugh.
0380977788|5.0|Terrific book! This is the first time I have ever read ANYTHING by Neil Gaiman. \\"Coraline\\" is a facinating fast paced book that will leave you with chills. I enjoyed little Coraline's adventures and could not put the book down until I finished it. Then, when I was done, I started reading it again. You can be sure that I will be reading other books by this author. Not just for children, this book is a great read!
0061015725|4.0|I actually enjoyed this book.  Sure, it may not be up there with some of Chichton's other works but it's still worth the money I paid for it.  I found the premise fascinating and the execution was too bad either.  <br />Also recommended:  McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood, The da Vinci Code
0385510438|5.0|I loved everything about this book, and it reminds me of one of Grisham's first books, A TIME TO KILL. The characters were so real and well-developed. His books are always so full of rich detail that I just sink into the words and almost become a participant in the plot.  There were really two plots going on in this book.  The first one was the murder and rape of a young mother in the small town of Clanton, Mississippi and the subsequent arrest and trial of Danny Padgitt.  The second plot was the friendship between Willie Traynor, the newspaper owner, <BR>and Callie Ruffin, the last juror.  Grisham does a remarkable job of weaving these two plot lines together and having them mesh at the end.  The result was just so good that I savored every word.  I really hope that all book-lovers will get a chance to read this wonderful story.
B00004Z400|1.0|I don't mean to run counter to the herd, but most of the reviewers are giving the Deftones way too much credit.  Chino Moreno's vocals are so gritty that they are unlistenable, and the lyrics are so contrived that I don't even think the thirteen year old weepy child of divorce that the Deftones are targetting could find them anything but laughable.  The &quot;Back to School&quot; song is an excellent example of the way people who pretend to find high school an agony capitalize on it long after leaving; so sorry that plodding through the school system is so hard, Chino.<br />The one slice of brilliance in this CD is the track &quot;Passenger&quot;, which features Maynard James Keenan as many have noted.  Sadly, I stomped this terrible album to pieces before discovering that.<br />Oh well.
B000068PQ0|5.0|If you grew up in the '70s getting stoned to Pink Floyd and Robin Travers and Jeff Beck then this is it - the best f*cking album ever made.  Load up the bong, pour another vodka and grapefruit, and drop a quaalude, this album will send you to place where you can forget NASCAR, the power bill, and your wife's living room redecoration project.    The Flaming Lips are the closest thing to God you will find this side of the 21st century - enjoy.

These guys even though they are not that well known are absolutley amazing and are gonna be around for a lot longer.
0142000663|5.0|As staged in the 1920&iexcl;¦s, Steinbeck starts with a subtle beginning. A slow developing plot, but worth while if you be patient. This book is definitely worth the time and effort, if you read a book once a year. A mixture of both intimidation and desperation sets fills your mind, and entices you to continue reading. The Joads, a family of four from Oklahoma, are on a journey westward toward California, with grandpa and grandma, after a famine sets over and destroys most of their crops. As the story continues on, the Joads realize that death and hatred pay a significant part out of their country. Death was the biggest cost from reaching their goal. Many family members died, and so, the family started to question the destiny. Being intimidated and threatened treason from the other states, the Joads feel despised. There is only one communication that Steinbeck wants to communicate, &iexcl;¥the hard workers survive&iexcl;¦. The weak does not. The perseverance and indifference from the other people create this silence war from other states. Some where nice folks and some didn&iexcl;¦t crack a smile at all. People not only scorn them, but actually refuse to serve them. As a book, it would be one of the most memorable one, and to compensate the slow pace, the conclusion. The Great Depression brought many people down, and this is actually what life was during that time.<br />It is fairly a nice body, with many uses of southern accented language. Steinbeck should be famous for using all those apostrophes and accents, which I would never know how to do it. &iexcl;§I ain&iexcl;¦t got nothin&iexcl;¦ for you, boy,&iexcl;¨ quotes the Joads, as an example.<br />The ending was actually quite a shock. It was like, &iexcl;¥then I woke up and it was all a dream&iexcl;¦ endings. I don&iexcl;¦t want to spoil it, and certainly I wouldn&iexcl;¦t tell you. It was abrupt and unexpected. A must read to all people of all ages, but beware; you are in for many surprises.
B00005176F|5.0|Blur is both a great singles band and a great albums band. The Best of Blur focuses on its prowess as a singles band, and in this regard might more correctly be called \\"Blur's Greatest Hits.\\"  (If I may split hairs, it seems to me that a CD called \\"Greatest Hits\\" should include pretty much only hit singles, while one titled \\"Best Of\\" should more fully represent the artist's \\"best\\" material, including hit singles and album tracks.)  Nit-picking aside, The Best of Blur serves as a perfect model for a worthwhile (and worth the money) compilation.  First, with 18 tracks, it features about three-quarters of the singles that charted in the US and UK, plus one well-chosen album cut and a new song for good measure (the fact that about a half-dozen chart singles are missing is indicative of what a successful band Blur was in the 90s).  Moreover, the content of this disc leaves no question as the overall quality of Blur's output.  Finally, while this can only be realized in hindsight, The Best of was released at an ideal time, as the recording of Blur's 2003 release Think Tank would mark the beginning of a new era for the band.<br /><br />The most obvious shortcoming of this disc is that it slights Blur's superb second CD, Modern Life Is Rubbish, by including only one of its tracks, \\"For Tomorrow.\\"  The most inexplicable omission would be the the proto-Britpop single \\"Popscene\\", but the singles \\"Chemical World\\" and \\"Sunday, Sunday\\" are also missing.  As it happens, however, this weakness is turned into a strength by leaving room for the inclusion of three tracks from its more experimental (i.e., less poppy, more personal) sixth CD 13.  Here's  how that works:  \\"For Tomorrow\\" serves as a great teaser for the Modern Life CD, which is brimming with great tracks, and should be owned by anyone who likes what they hear on The Best Of.  Moreover, 13 is not the place to start for someone who is being introduced to Blur.  Hence, the disc both whets the listener's appetite and fills his or her plate.  If the tracks from 13 don't quite click with the listener (and there is no reason why they shouldn't), at least he or she will have three of the best tracks from that CD here.  And the absence of the singles from Modern Life gives one all the more reason to buy that CD, which anyone with more than a passing interest in the band - or in good music in general - should do anyway.<br /><br />From Blur's other discs, you basically get all the singles: two of the three from Leisure, all four from Parklife (plus the album track \\"This Is A Low\\"), three of the four from both The Great Escape and Blur, and all three from 13.  (Two of the missing singles, \\"Stereotypes\\" - from The Great Escape - and \\"M.O.R.\\" - from Blur - are included in live versions on a limited 2-CD edition.)  Also included is a decent new track,\\"Music Is My Radar,\\"<br />which sort of foreshadows - for better and for worse - the direction Blur would take on its next studio album.  While some of the hits are better than others, none of them are sub par as songs, and they all belong on what is likely to be the first Blur purchase for many listeners, especially American ones. And while some may complain about the non-chronological order of the songs, the sequencing actually does a very good job of accentuating both the variety and continuity of Blur's catalog.<br /><br />The bottom line is that a compilation should be practical: it should serve as an introduction to encourage you to buy more by the artist, or it should be comprehensive enough to prevent you from having to buy anything else.  That said, The Best Of Blur is unlikely to save you any money, but it will make you happy to spend the extra that you do.  If this is the place you start, it is unlikely to be the place that you stop.  There are simply too many terrific songs on the band's studio discs for any compilation short of a box set to be truly comprehensive.  All the same, this is a great compilation to have even if you own the other discs, as it puts almost all of the band's hits in one place.  (I had four other Blur CDs when I bought The Best of.  Modern Life, Parklife, and The Great Escape are also great places to start.)<br /><br />Clearly, The Best of Blur succeeds at being a model compilation.  Now, does this model compilation contain great songs?  In a word, yes.  For the most part, it is catchy, distinctly British pop, with sophistication, some keen social commentary, and an impressive amount of variety considering that it contains music recorded in a span of less than a decade. The songs are alternately entertaining and poignant, and usually both.  In short, this disc is an essential chapter in the history of British popular music.  Sure, the lyrics may not always be terribly profound, and there may be one too many \\"na na na\\" or \\"la la la\\" sections to fill space, but if that were a crime in pop music, then many artists would have to plead guilty.  But reviews of the individual records is the place to talk about the songs, and if you are interested in checking out Blur for the first time, I assume that you are reading those as well.  At the same time, however, you are probably wondering if this compilation is worth investing in.  Put it this way: the songs on The Best of Blur are the ones that made this group one of the most popular British bands of the 90s.  As a whole, they suffice to show that while Blur may not be as great as The Kinks or The Jam (and that is too tall of an order for any band to fill), they are truly their worthy heirs.<br /><br />Long Live Blur!er discs, as it puts almost all of the band's hits in one place.

6301763041|5.0|Ever since i \\"accidentally\\" saw this movie when i was 7 years old, it has been my favorite.  As well as Johnny Depp being my favorite actor.  This may be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, but that seems to be what makes it so great.  The cast is awesome, and Johnny Depp is georgeous! I will contunue to watch this movie forever!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Well, it is easy to dismiss Interpol as imitators of Echo & the Bunnymen and Joy Division. But listen carefully to \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" (and give it a few spins if necessary) and you'll see how unique this band is.<br />First of all, this is an album in which nothing is left to chance. All the songs are played with extreme and equal care from start to finish.<br />Second, these guys master their musical instruments. Feel the drums and the bass in \\"Obstacle 1\\", the intro to \\"Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down\\" and how the tension builds up in \\"Hands Away\\". As a matter of fact, each and every song has something that prevents you from pressing the skip button on your CD player.<br />And that's not all: \\"Untitled\\" is one of the best openers I have ever heard, and \\"Obstacle 1\\", \\"NYC\\", \\"PDA\\", \\"Say Hello to the Angels\\" and \\"Leif Erikson\\" are true masterpieces.<br />Summing up, in their stunning debut, these guys use brilliantly their influences and make a sound all of their own. Five Stars.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|If one were to define brilliance in film, they would look to Scarface.  From the start you are wisked away into the drug overdosed crime scene of South Florida and the world of Tony Montana played excellently by Al Pacino in one of his greatest roles ever.  The character of Tony Montana can be seen in many immigrants and others who have started from the bottom and have gone through society through the only means that they felt they could make it through, which in most cases was the world of drugs.  Pacino's character is one of the most believable characters of all time.  You hate him at the same time that you love him.  You understand him as much as you want to help him.<br />The soundtrack plays a great role in the beauty of this film.  Classic hits from the 80s are constantly playing in the backgrounds of late night car rides and at the club.  This movie puts you into the world of Tony Montana and takes you on a journey through a world that is yours for the taking.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I think this movie just passed right over the top of my head. Yes, I know the differences in foreign travel but.....I kept waiting for the story to develop and something to happen in this movie.<br />Sorry, a waste of talent, movie money and my time.
0385504209|4.0|There is an excellent suspense storyline to this book.  The characters are semi-interesting and you will be compelled to turn the pages as is the occasion with most suspense stories, but what grabs you in this novel is the information that you receive that sparks interests in the subject matter.  Some critics have written that this is completely fictional, but there are many truths as to what is being said.  Dan Brown did extensive research for this novel and it is evident in the pages after pages of the novel.  This novel will lead you to read his previous novels as well as books such as &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; and &quot;The Gospel of Mary Magdelene.&quot;  This is a book for those who are interested in broadening their mind and are open to accepting concepts that are often slandered by society.  This novel can't be read simply for the story, which is par.  This book has been at the top of the bestseller list for a reason that I don't need to tell you.  It is book that many have read and is a great conversation piece for discussion.  This type of novel which can only be categorized as an intelligent suspense leads to the discovery of many secrets that you can believe, but don't have to, such as the nature of Mona Lisa's smile and the history of the Catholic Church.  The present day drama that now ensues within the church can even be understood when one reads this novel as things are looked at into new light and new understanding.  The main character is Robert Langdon who was also the protagonist for Brown's novel &quot;Angels and Demons.&quot;  Langdon's character as well as the rest is not entirely fascinating, but this book is still worth the read for its information and fascinating subject.
0788812408|4.0|Although made long after Walt's time, I am sure he would be pleased with this masterpiece created by Disney Studios.<br />This is the story of a young mermaid girl who is fascinated with the humans' world.  She collects all sorts of trinkets and treasures found at the bottom of the sea and invents stories of what their uses must be.  One day, she ventures to the surface and falls hopelessly in love with a human prince.  Only the wicked sea witch, Ursula, can grant her wish to be human - but at the tragic cost of her beautiful voice.  The ensuing showdown between the lovely mermaid, the heroic prince, the wicked witch and the powerful mer-king is full of passion, heartache and love.<br />Retelling the fairy tale of the young mermaid girl who longs to be a human, this animated feature includes all the great characters - and then some!  The mermaid princess Ariel is so full of life and charisma.  You just cannot help but love her!  Eric, the human prince she falls in love with is noble, strong and so loving.  Ariel's father, the King Triton, is so much like all fathers - all he wants is for his daughter to be happy, regardless of the heartache it causes him.  Added to the mix in Disney's version are the comedic Flounder and Sebastian, Ariel's underwater best friends.  Scuttle the seagull proves just how dimwitted the seagull can be.  All of these characters play off each other beautifully, unfolding a spectacular and heartwarming tale.<br />The animation in this film is a superb combination of realistic hand drawings with the first beginnings of computer effects.  The computer animation is minimal and does not distract from the story, allowing the viewer to truly appreciate the artistry of hand animation.  The score, as well, is so full of power, humor, and passion.<br />This film does not rate a full five stars from me for one small reason: the weak family values.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a trend of Disney's.  Ariel has no mother and there is never any mention of her or her absence.  Ariel is only 14 years old, yet her father has no problem giving her over to a man she has spent an entire three days with; a man, by the way, that King Triton has never met.  I realize that most children would not read so deeply into a musical animation film, but the underlying message is still there.  I would have liked to see guidance that is more parental.  After all, some parents actually know what they are talking about.<br />Overall, this is a fantastic classic tale, beautifully told by the masters of animation.r or her absence.

B00012FXB8|5.0|Alien 3 is a great film, and I loved it. It is just, too confusing. When the super facehugger facehugged Ripley, it sent a queen embryo, but then it facehugged an ox, I thought Ripley already had the embryo inside, so It couldn't give another embryo. It is very thrilling, the beast-like alien.
0805062971|5.0|in response to \\"musclehead\\":<BR>1) nice job getting your own opinions. your point number 2 makes no sense. you're ragging on the book because you think the two main characters are gay, but you're also saying \\"oh but i'm not homophobic.\\" right. if you aren't then it really shouldn't make a difference, so your point is irrelevant. and then you end that point with how they both need each other. if you've actually read the book or seen the movie, then you would understand the reason for this,<br />2)of course getting beaten up isn't an empowering experience. the point of the book is that in order to be free from social pressures such as owning BMW's or 2 million dollar houses, you must lose everything. they moved into an abandoned house that didn't even have sanitary running water. if you get your butt kicked you know that it doesn't really get worse. when you beat someone up you feel a sense of power. it goes both ways. sometimes you must be picked up, and sometimes you must be put down. this is a manual way of doing this. in society it is an automatic thing to be picked up and be put down, but it's sporatic, so you never know when its going to happen. this is a manual way of making sure it happens.<br />3)are you saying that masculine violence doesn't make you more masculine? please, \\"musclehead\\", enlighten me. tell me what does make someone more masculine. would a man that wears dresses qualify as masculine. if you see two boxers going at it on tv, you automatically think \\"i'd never mess with them, they look really strong.\\" of course you wouldn't mess with them. why? because they are much stronger than you, and more masculine.<br />4) i don't think that chuck palahniuk stole his ideas from other authors. <br />if you want to disprove any of these points you can email me at officedrummer14@yahoo.com i'd be glad to have a conversation with any of you about this.
B000002KJM|3.0|Very few bands in the history of rock could I say fully realised their own sound on their first album. Boston is one. Black Sabbath is another. But especially, ZZ Top. Simply put, you hear ZZ Top's first album, you've heard all the other albums they put out through the seventies--particularly, in terms of sound quality, musical style, and equipment. This one is a little more raw, and a little bit more funky in places. But if you're going back to this album to hear what a &quot;1970 ZZ Top&quot; sounded like--and as I was, hoping maybe for something a little more psychedelic, you'll be sadly disappointed. You would have to go back and find a very rare first single called &quot;Salt Lick&quot; they recorded a year prior to this album in 1969, when they actually had a keyboard player, in order to hear a very different sounding ZZ Top--one that sounded much like another Texan, Steve Miller, and his band's early-&quot;Space Cowboy&quot; stuff from around that same time period.<BR>Aside from the fact that the album had very little commercial appeal at the time, as none of their albums would until &quot;Tres Hombres&quot; a couple of years later, their isn't much here to differentiate this from every other album that followed in terms of songwriting, song selection, etc. A few good funky riff songs, the standouts being &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Goin' Down to Mexico&quot;, followed by a lot of boring slow blues filler, which seemed to be the pattern they would follow on subsequent albums.<BR>A lot of their better songs are ones like &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, where it<BR>sounds as if they built the entire song around a guitar riff, making up for the lack of a lot of intelligent lyrical content.<BR>When ZZ Top is boring, they can be downright depressing (&quot;Old Man&quot; and &quot;Just Got Back From Baby's&quot; will certainly put you to sleep!)<BR>When I first heard this album, the one thing that stood out most to me was the contribution Dusty Hill made to the bandin the early days. He doesn't seem to do much now, except when they need someone to imitate Elvis Presley on an Elvis remake. But he had one of the bluesiest voices I've ever heard from a white man, especially on the track &quot;Goin' Down To Mexico&quot;, one of the standouts for me on this album, as well as on the next album, &quot;Rio Grande Mud&quot;, with the song, &quot;Just Got Paid&quot;. I don't know why Billy Gibbons has been allowed to take over most of the lead vocals in recent years as he has, but he is, by far, no match for Dusty Hill's booming voice that he displayed on the singing on this album (as I've noted in previous reviews, lead guitarists can sometimes make for lousy singers--and Billy Gibbons shaky voice sometimes veers close to that stuttering, stammering Randy Bachman from BTO!)<BR>But I respect ZZ Top for one thing: Once they latched onto a sound, particularly after they ditched a keyboardist and became a trio, they stubbornly refused to let go--at least until 1981's &quot;El Loco&quot;. ZZ Top's first album was the first of many with the very same sound.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox made so many mistakes with this show that it is not even funny.  I mean thinking that starting this show in the middle of the action would be a good idea?  Anyway, this is one of the best shows to ever be on television and you should see it for yourself.  The pilot is great and makes everything more clear.  The episode that first got me hooked, in the original airing of the show, is &quot;Out of Gas&quot;.  I recommend it highly as well as the three unaired episodes.  I hope the movie gets off the ground or something because watching these episodes again has made me realize how much I miss, and NEED, this show.  Oh and let's not forget that this is the only Joss Whedon show that has words to its theme song. &quot;Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand.  I don't care, I'm still free, you can't take the sky from me.  Take me out to the black, tell'em I ain't coming back.  Burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me.  There's no place I can be since I found Serenity.  And you can't take the sky from me.&quot;

Their energy can not be compared with any other band and the style of music is unique. <BR>This album is worth buying if you are a punk or a ska fan. And to all the so called 'punk fans', for instance glitch010101, that said this album is crap because of the bad recording... have you ever listened to THE GREAT ROCK'N'ROLL SWINDLE from the SEX PISTOLS? If you had then you would know that it is not unusual for punk records to be of bad quality. And besides the quality isnt that bad.... i have heard worse. <BR>The bottom line is that if you are a true punk fan then the quality will not bother you enough not to buy this amazing CD.

Eric Bana captures the emotionally detached Bruce Banner perfectly, and Sam Elliot pulls in a fine performance as General Thunderbolt Ross.  The Hulk effects are amazing.  ILM took a twelve foot man and made him seem real, all with CGI.  Yes, the character looks unreal, most 12 foot tall green men would.  <BR>The extras help sell this DVD.  The behind the scenes features are hilarious, especially watching Ang Lee himself act out the Hulk scenes in a motion capture suit.  Comic enthusiasts will also enjoy a scene-for-scene comic version of the Hulk's transformation.  All in all, this movie is well worth purchasing.

Then it  bursts into Tonight, Tonight, an absolutely beautiful song in every sense of the word.  The entire cd continues like this, and you feel relaxed yet excited, happy, yet with an impending sadness that only Smashing Pumpkins can bring.  I don't recommend you buy this album - I insist you do.  You can forget any reviews you can find that slates this album - they are obviously complete c**p.  You don't believe me yet?

B000067IZ3|4.0|There is no doubt in my mind that Steven Sodeburgh's &quot;Traffic&quot; is one of the best movies ever made on underworld.<BR>The director is on top of his form as he seamlessly weaves 4 different stories bound together by the deadly thread of narcotics.There is the naive but well intentioned Justice Depaartment officla (Michel Douglas) in USA fighting drugs on 2 levels.One as the official in cahrge of War on Drugs and other is fighting to save his daughter who has fallen in the trap of the deadly habit of drugs.On the other side of the battle is a wealthy couple where the husband is arrested on cahrge of drug traffic and his pregnent housewife whose quest for her husband's freedom descends her in to the dark world of drugs and hitmen.On the other side of the border in Mexico where the narcotic dealers rule there is the voice of consceince a mexican cop(Benecio Del Toro in his stunning Oscar winning turn) honest enought not to be involved in the traffic yet street smart enough not to take the drug dealers head on.<BR>The pace is slow and the director makes a conscious effort to take a matured view on the drug war without sounding too righteous,also none of the stories end when the movies finshes thus leaves the intellegent viewer enought material to think over.<BR>The all star cast includes Michel Douglas,Katherine Zeta Jones and the Oscar winner Benecio Del toro all give memorable perfomramce.Even the fringe cast of Dennis Quaid,Don Chedale pass the bill satisfactorily.<BR>God father this movie is not but if you want to see a serious thought provoking movie then &quot;Traffic&quot;is your choice,it is my choice mainly because of Benecio Del Toro's incredialby charismatic performance.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Snatch is one of the best films I've ever seen.  Guy Ritchie's sophomore follow-up to his 1998 sleeper hit Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch revisits the previous film's territory of London's crime-ridden underbelly, and does so with the same brand of humor and stylish direction that made Ritchie's first effort a surprise success. With a labyrinthine plot that is ostensibly oriented around a missing diamond, Snatch introduces viewers to three groups of characters intent on retrieving the elusive stone, which has been stolen from an Antwerp jeweler. In the first group are friends and business partners Turkish (Jason Statham, who also supplies the film's voice-over narration) and Tommy (Stephen Graham), who join up with Mickey (Brad Pitt), an Irish gypsy and boxer. Turkish and Tommy make arrangements with Mickey to take a fall in a match engineered by lunatic gang leader Brick Top (Alan Ford). In another corner resides equally loony Russian gangster Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia), who has asked Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) to place a bet on the match for him. Boris is also scheming to have Sol (Lennie James), the owner of a pawn shop, rob the place with a couple of dim associates. Meanwhile, Avi (Dennis Farina), freshly arrived in London from New York, hires Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) to find Franky when he goes missing; it seems that it was none other than Franky who was supposed to be transporting the purloined diamond to New York. Outrageously funny and full of edge-of-your-seat action, the movie is rated &quot;R&quot; for violence, profanity, nudity, drug references, and disturbing sequences.  A must see hit for all.

0780628551|2.0|Last night I picked it up where Theron is in her kitchen when she learns that there is 'a problem'.....from there on there is 'a problem' not only for her but for the viewer with the way the story unfolds until the very end. <BR>This is a repeat in some ways of The Devil's Advocate but Reeves was much better as the annoyed but understanding husband...<BR>I had many questions e.g. what is the relevance of the twins? is it because there was an interruption for 'two minutes?'......and what is the need of repeating how many times? &quot;he is in there&quot; &quot;I am in there&quot; etc. .....she goes home to take her pills where I guessed he would be.....she allows the radio that is obviously bringing such pleasure to her 'husband' to stay in their apartment....I would have chucked it out the window to see if it could take the nosedive down to the street below.... we never do find out why the cab driver could not take her to Washington Square....and an endless number of other things in the script that make no sense.........but as my cousin, who was in the movie biz used to say 'there would be no movie then'......which might have been better given the muddled mess they produced......
B000002GYI|5.0|Although there are already dozens of 5-star reviews of this album, I just had to add my own.  Yes, this album is THAT good, and I agree with the reviewer who said it should be on a 10 Greatest of all time list.  Tastes being what they are, not everyone in the world will love this album, but if you like electronic music even a teeny tiny bit (and you probably do, since you're reading this page), this album is simply a must-have. Whether it's techno, electro, house, downtempo, IDM, synth-pop, or someother sub-genre(s) that float your boat, this album WILL appeal to you.<br />It really blows my mind to think that this album was released in 1981, practically 25 years ago. Forget the prophetic lyrics about a computer-connected world and the rise of home computing, the music itself sounds timeless.  You cannot pin an &quot;80's&quot; label on this dark, multilayered sound, which if released today would be hailed as a wholly modern, year 2004 electro masterpiece  -- yes, I'd call it electro, based on the percussion programming and the &quot;bleepy&quot; analog synths-- and not an 80's throwback.   Computer World is remeniscent of the Detroit techno sound, but of course it predates it by many years, and I would also say that it's more original and engaging than most Detroit stuff that I've heard (and I love the Detroit sound, FYI.)  Anthony Rother, another German, and his alias Little Computer People also carry on the sonic tradition of this ground-breaking album. <br />Although I don't own the complete works of Kraftwerk, I'd wager that this is probably their greatest creation.  Computer World was the first Kraftwerk album that I ever purchased, and since it was so astonishingly good, of course I bought some other Kraftwerk albums.  The other albums range in quality from so-so to downright bad, and not even their better stuff (Transeurope Express, for example) is anywhere near as good as Computer World.  Music, lyrics, overall soul and feeling and originality -- Computer World has it all.
B00011D1OA|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites, and I was delighted when this 2-disc DVD set was released.  Now all the special features, in piecemeal in earlier DVD and VHS tape releases, are all together in one set, with a high definition transfer of the 1994 restoration which is truely outstanding!  Plus, some never before released pieces such as the Rex Harrison Golden Globe acceptance speech, the kickoff production dinner, and other extras like the extensive archive of black and white and color production stills, costume sketches by Cecil Beaton (who won an Academy Award for costume design), and \\"behind the scenes\\" pictures really add to this 5 star DVD treatment of a classic Best Picture.  It's also interesting to listen to the Gene Allen commentary, joined by others such as Marni Nixon, who reminisce about working on this historic masterpiece.  Their perspectives of the costumes, set design, working on the dubbing with Audrey Hepburn, the casting choice of Audrey Hepburn vs. Julie Andrews, the working conflicts between  George Cukor (the director) and Cecil Beaton, and the general professionalism of everyone involved in the production, make the watching of this movie even the more fascinating.  Highly Recommended!!
6300218031|4.0|OMG! this movie was filmed at my high school! Its so trippy. San Pedro High. Its a nice good movie. A girls night movie
B0000CEB4V|1.0|Don't buy this DVD if you expect to enjoy your home theater system.  The audio is uneven, ranging from wonderfully crisp to terribly muted.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I don't usually review Britney records but I couldn't resist this time around. 'In The Zone' is pure FIRE, Britney absolutely brough the heat on this record. Britney reached new heights with this record, Vocally, Musically and Professionally. What I love most about this record is the diversity, You've got everything from Pop, Techno, Hip-hop and House. On \\"Me Against The Music\\" we see two generations of pop royalty coming together to make a wicked dance anthem, Extremely underrated song. Next, Britney hooks up with Lil Jon protegé's Ying Yang Twins on \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\", Britney croons over a heavy bass line complete with a fiddle...In the beginning of the song Britney states \\"Yeah, this is for all the southern boys out there, Check this out.\\" The next highlight of In The Zone is \\"Breathe On Me\\", Britney's vocals sound sexy and flawless here, Hopefully this is being considered as a single because it was made to be a club anthem. The single that's making a lot of noise right now is of course \\"Toxic\\", The Garage sounding slick radio smash. Nikki Sixx, guitarist and principle songwriter for Mötley Crue recently gave his own review of the track calling the vocals \\"badass\\", I'd most defenitely have to agree. This is one of the best songs she's done to date. Moving right along to \\"Touch Of My Hand\\", Where Britney takes an \\"Erotica\\" turn touching on a hush hush topic, Masturbation. Britney sings flirty lyrics over asian strings, Awesome!. Britney ends the album on a good, but sad note with \\"Everytime\\"....This is a song Spears penned during her breakup with Justin Timberlake, \\"My weakness caused you pain<BR>And this song is my sorry\\". <br />In The Zone is one of the best albums on the market right now, In my opinion. Even better than \\"Stripped\\", Which is probably one of the most overhyped records in history. So go pick this up, As soon as possible!
B0001906O0|5.0|I have been a Cure fan since their beginnings. So I was really happy and excited to hear that this box was being released. I am still amazed at the quality of their &quot;B-sides&quot;, not to mention that most of these songs are hard to find now. The songs included are better than most bands &quot;A&quot; material. The Cure was able to experiment with sound and bring you to other places. Sometimes this would lead to the song becoming unrecognizable to the original. This box will give you a glimpse into an artist being able to express themselves. It was a great journey that the Cure took me on. Seeing them grow and push the envelope of modern music and what was considered &quot;Pop&quot;. If you are a hardcore fan, you probably have all of these songs already (but will probably buy this anyway) and if you are a somewhat curious newcomer...do yourself a favor and buy this NOW!!! This is box set is as strong as they come. You will not regret it. Enjoy.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is simply, the best album ever created.  Tool has gone past Music, this is art.  There are so many levels to this album that even after listening to it 50 times, you still enjoy every single second and wish it would never end.  Like a previous reviewer said, you're not the same after listening to this CD.  You may never listen to any other collection of songs the same way, that is, unless Tool raises the bar with their next album.
0440178002|5.0|This book resembles a long term relationship with someone that you love.  It's a wonderful book all the way through and that's a good thing because this book will take a very long time to read.  You will think about this book throughout your entire day.  <BR>Once you get to those final hours of reading you feel sad because you will know that the your almost done reading it and you won't want it to end.  Finishing the book was like saying goodbye to a good friend.  Truly unforgettable.
B00006879E|4.0|This CD is great. I had no clue who this group was until i heard &quot;This Love&quot; on the radio, &amp; i had to have it. Once i listened, i realized i had heard &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; before too. This group is completely original, combining r&amp;b with alternative rock in a new way. it's hard to describe exactly what this group sounds like, but the CD is great. <br />Highlights: Shiver (best song on the CD), Harder to Breathe, Tangled, This Love. <br />I'd give it 5 stars, but a lot of the songs are really short. Like, less than 3 minutes - 4 minutes. And there are only 12 songs. &amp; if you like this group, you'd love Jamiroquai.
B000001IQH|5.0|Rancid's \\"And Out Come The Wolves\\" is an amazing blend of Punk Rock, Ska/Reggae, and pure Rock N' Roll. Every song on here is as classic as the album itself. There's far too much praise to give this album that could fit into 1,000 words, so all that can be said is that if you don't own this album definitely get it. These songs are honest, energetic accounts of the world we live in, and if they hit you like they hit me, catchy enough to get stuck in your head for the rest of your life. But also definitely don't stop here, check out ANYTHING else by Rancid or related bands (Operation Ivy, The Transplants, Lars Fredericksen And The Bastards).
0784011176|5.0|Beautiful and brilliant are the words that come to my mind for this movie. The music still haunts me. The ocean, the music, the rain and the forest, one does feel it all. The movie is an amazing emotional rollercoaster ride.<BR>              As a mute women married off to a stranger, something which must be common in those days, Ada's (Holly Hunter) piano is how talks. Her husband fails to listen to her but Keitel does! This movie by a women director explores women's perspective in relationships in such a musical, passionate, beautiful fassion that it takes your breath away. <BR>          Some of the scenes in this movie are going to stay with me for a long, long time. The music too.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I give this albumn a 4 simply because DT are amazing musicians. Unfortunately after anticipating this release for months I was extremely dissapointed. The songs all blend into eachother and the listener easily gets lost in them. The only song I really liked was the last one, the only one that actually sounds like classic Dream Theater.
B000001FS3|5.0|I seriously cannot understand how anybody can any feelings towards this album except total admiration.  This is the only album I have ever heard that simply does not miss a beat...every song is a masterpiece.  I still can't believe Joshua Tree was only ranked #26 on the Rolling Stone all-time best albums lists...all those Beatles albums in front of it are great (I really do love the Beatles) but each of them have weak points, songs that aren't quite as good as the rest.  For any other band, each song on this album would be their hit single, the song that justifies the album.  To have eleven of them on one album...what can you say?  Only that anybody who doesn't own it is living a sad, sheltered life, and any people who call it overrated or pathetic might well need some form of treatment.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say that yes I've bought this cd, and yes I had doubts about it. I'd also like to say that, I'm not going to ... anyone. I'm writing how i really feel about this cd. Whether you're a fan or not, I think it's not right to just call a cd crap just cuz you don't like the singer or that it's the best thing ever just because you're a hardcore fan...You really have to have listen to the entire cd \\"on your own\\", and \\"not\\" just a few tracks, to make a fair review. Enjoy.<br />The music department of this cd is very diverse and it's not so \\"poppish\\" where more than half of the cd sounds the same. The lyrics could be better in some places though but I'm glad she wrote a little more than half of the songs on the cd, that's definently a plus. <br />Me Against The Music: We've all heard this one. The collaboration with brit. and madonna. This song isn't the best brit. song i've heard but it's still a catchy song. The chorus is simple yet catchy and then the fast part along the \\"i wanna get in the zone\\" area is interesting.<BR>Song Rating: 8/10<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom: Well, this song is one of my least fav. on the cd. If the Yin Yang Twins weren't in there then it may have sounded better or maybe if they sang at dif. parts then it might've sounded better, but who knows. The opening and the chorus are the best parts to me, could've been a little better.<BR>Song Rating: 6/10<br />Showdown: I've got to admit, i do like the way this song sounds. It has this interesting \\"popcorn/bubble\\" sound to it. It's kind of cool and the chorus sounds nice and the guitar in and before the chorus is a nice edition:) This song is fun to listen to, i enjoyed it. <BR>Song Rating: 8/10<br />Breathe On Me: This is one of my fav. songs on the cd. It has a very sensual techno tune and her sexy vocals are really nice here. Her voice and the music flow together rather smoothly and the song is very soothing to listen too. This is definently an A+ song. <BR>Song Rating: 10/10<br/>Early Mornin': This one was made by Moby, so it's not the best collaboration ever,BUT this song is easy listening and has some nice/mellow sounds to it. And i admire her raspy vocals in this song. The first time i heard it, i hated it, but now it's kind of grown on me. And i've got to say it again, i like the way her voice sounds in this song. Not too bad. <BR>Song Rating: 7/10<br />Toxic: This song is getting more and more airplay as we speak...read. Besides that hot video, this song sounds really hot too. Toxic is probably my fav. non-ballad britney song. The strings in the song are intoxicating and addicting as well as the 007/surf-ish kind of sound too. It has a cool techno sound to it too. I'm really pleased with this song:) <BR>Song Rating: 10/10<br />Outrageous: This is another hip hop-ish song, as was \\"boom boom\\". Out of all the hip hop tracks she's done,even boys, this one is the best in my opinion. It has a cool eastern sound and the chorus is cool as well as the \\"la la la la la la la.\\" <BR>Song Rating:8/10<br />Touch Of My Hand: I love the eastern vibe in this song. This is probably the most sensual song in addition to breathe on me. Her voice sounds really nice on this song...i can't find the right word to describe it...some people say she sounds like madonna on this song, but i wouldn't know. You'll have to listen to it yourself;) I like the instruments used in this song, very cool. <BR>Song Rating: 9/10<br />The Hook Up: Here's a new one. This song is a reggae type song. At first i thought \\"whoah...reggae? this is gonna be weird?!?\\" But to my surprise i've found this song to very addicting, especially the chorus. This one also has an eastern tune to it, which I admire. This is a good song to groove to. <BR>Song Rating: 8/10<br />Shadow: The first ballad on the cd. It's a dark-ish song, talking about missing someone and you only \\"see\\" their shadow instead of themself. It has very nice strings in it, which i truly admire and her vocals aren't soaring,but they are her own one of a kind vocals, and they sound nice especially at the climax. Great song, good lyrics, and good voice <BR>Song Rating: 10/10<br />Brave New Girl: Ok, this seems like the only poppish song on here, and that's cool. Because none of the rest sound like it. This song is kind of a girl song, hints the name \\"brave new girl\\" , not that that's a bad thing though. Some say it reminds them of Hilary Duff and i've only heard two or three of her songs on the radio so i'll go with that. <BR>Song Rating: 7/10<br />Everytime: This is the one. This song is my fav. britney spears song she's ever done. The song is haunting and her voice is so calm and innocent. The lyrics are heartfelt and kind of sad, thought i felt a tear...wait... :o what did i say?...She's written this song and made the tune of the song on the piano, so she is stepping up and that's good. I hope she writes more songs likes this ,cuz it sounds great. Sorry, but i'm gonna cheat on this one <br />Song Rating: 12/10 ;)<br />MATM Remix: it's a remix with an eastern sound. Not too much to say about it...but it sounds alright. <BR>Song Rating: 7/10<br />This cd is actually not that bad, i'm looking forward to what she has next. I hope my review has helped anyone who is curious with Britney Spears's \\"In The Zone\\" cd.
B000001FTQ|5.0|Some people have said that Wide Awake in America is a bit expensive, for four songs...I don't agree.  If you're comparing price to quality, this CD is ridiculously underpriced.  All of the songs are good, but the live version of Bad is, quite simply, the best song I have ever heard.  The studio version on Unforgettable Fire was great, but this one took U2 to a whole new level.  U2's lyrics have always been what makes them special...and this song is U2 at their best, and that doesn't even address Edge's guitar line and the keyboard twinkles which both drive the song.  In my humble opinion, Wide Awake in America is worth three or four times what you will pay for it...and I would pay that just for the one song. Absolutely fantastic!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I saw a pristine print of this movie with a full house at the George Eastman House here in Rochester several years ago.  With its glorious opening zoom shot, great music (mostly from Meddle), insightful (albeit brief and scattered) interviews with the band members, and fleeting glimpses of them at work crafting Dark Side of the Moon, it instantly became a must-have.  But all that was available was a VHS copy, and I knew that this format couldn't do justice to the material.<br />I was elated when it was finally released on DVD, but also a bit hesitant when I saw that it was a \\"director's cut\\" - the original cut that I'd seen was just fine, thank you.  However, seeing that one of the extras was the \\"original concert film,\\" I figured that I couldn't lose, and went ahead and ordered it.<br />The bad news:  Neither copy is the same one that I saw at the Eastman - the \\"original\\" cut does not include any of the interview or recording session material ... just the music.  And the \\"director's\\" cut adds a lot of unnecessary outer space F/X and Pompeii art frills that sometimes distract from more than they enhance the core material.  (The continuity of the aforementioned opening zoom shot is destroyed, for instance.)<br />The good news:  At the very least, everything I saw previously IS on the DVD, even if I can't watch the movie in exactly the same way that I did originally.  And hey ... this IS Pink Floyd!  I've watched the film in its entirety five times since acquiring it and my fascination shows no signs of abating.  This is no self-congratulatory vanity 70's \\"rockumentary\\" (e.g., Led Zeppelin's \\"The Song Remains the Same\\") -- it's a true time capsule that yields innumerable insights (some unintentional) into a landmark rock group on the cusp of superstardom.  It captures the members at what would seem in hindsight to have been the apex of their camaraderie and collaborative music realization, and this makes it a must-see for any true Floyd fan.
B00009V7P8|5.0|absolutely one of the more exceptional pieces of music you'll have the pleasure to listen to....you owe it to yourself to own this....
B00003CXI1|1.0|I will try to keep this review rant-free, but it is going to be difficult. There are many causes behind my 1-star review of this abysmal movie, most of which follow:<BR>To begin with, the acting. All the children (with a few exceptions) over-act their parts, especially one Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), who appears to think that opening her mouth very wide, bobbing her head, and exhaling on each line will improve her performance. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), however, does not seem to act at all, apparently under the assumption that having the title role means he can just stand and deliver his lines with either forced or no emotion, in a Pokemon-esque style. But, in the words of the Potions Master, &quot;Fame clearly isn't everything.&quot; Alan Rickman and Dame Maggie Smith, as Professors Snape and McGonagall respectively, perform bravely in a sea of the mundane, and David Bradley gives his all to the character of Filch the Caretaker, but they are not enough to save this movie. Robbie Coltrane's giant Hagrid, though cute, is reduced to the one-liner (&quot;I shouldn'ave said that!&quot;) comic relief, much like Gimli in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (which at least had brilliant special effects and acting from the heart). Richard Harris (Dumbledore), though I do not wish to speak ill of the dead, lacks the twinkle and spirit his character has in the books.<BR>Secondly, there is the little matter of the special effects. To cram it all into one sentence, they are over-done, much like everything else in this movie. Fluffy, the three headed dog, looks like a creation of Pixar, and Quidditch, though ment to be thrilling and awe-inspiring, is rather like watching someone else play a video game. And lose.<BR>Not to be a purist, but one of the greatest issues that bugged me about this movie was its horrible, horrible mistreatment of the book (no offense Doug Thomas, author of the amazon.com review, but did you even read the book?!). Oh, sure, there are the small thingsone can be nit-picky about (the color change of Aunt Petunia's hair from blonde to brown, the students are not called in alphabetical order for the Sorting) but some of the blatant errors makes a Harry Potter fan's blood run cold. For exmple, Harry's eyes. In the book, Harry's eyes are the same color as his mother's (this is rumored to be very important in future books) and that color is green. Green, the color of grass and emeralds and Sprite bottles. Yet, Chris Columbus appears to be colorblind, for Harry's eyes in the film are blue! Blue! I apologize; I promised not to rant. Actually, the only things that do come from the book are presented in such a way that one thinks the writers used a checklist.<BR>If you add all this to John Williams' hyper-emotional score and the film's choppy delivery, you have a definate must-not-see.
0066620996|4.0|As more and more corporations and leaders listed in Collins book race to implement offshore outsourcing, I wonder whether they would go from great to good. One of the metrics of a great company is their ability to take care of employees. As more and more firms practice offshoring the implications are rather alarming.<br />After reading Collins book, I happened to read this book titled:  Offshore Outsourcing -- Business Models and Best Practices by Marcia Robinson and Ravi Kalakota.    <br />I was amazed to read that over 70% of Fortune 500 corporations are adopting this practice and moving very high quality jobs overseas.  And the strategy they are using is not outsourcing but building their own captive centers in places like India and the Phillipines.  The captive center, basically their own subsidiary, gives them a platform as well as significant tax advantages.<br />There was a detailed case study on GE that was illuminating. According to this book GE has over 20,000 employees in India performing back-office activities for all the different business units. Another case study on American Express illustrates a similar captive center model. This is an alarming trend. <br />Assuming that India, China and the Philippines and Russia grow by 2M jobs every year, that means that U.S and Europe where the bulk of offshore outsourcing is happening are   going to suffer 2M job losses. That scenario means an increase in unemployment of .75 to 1% per year in the U.S alone in the next three to five years. This will be catastrophic to the standard of living if this scenario plays out.<br />I am only scratching the surface of what this book talks about. But it got me thinking... what is the role of offshore outsourcing strategies in assessing the greatness of a company? What would Jim Collins have to say about offshore outsourcing?
0441172717|2.0|A famous quote in the book is, &quot;Fear is the mind-killer&quot;. I agree if you fear reading boring books as alternative to treating insominia.<BR>There were some good parts of the book that sparked interest, but they were few and far in between.<BR>I read the marketing ploys trying to convince the LOR fans that Dune was their science fiction savior. It's pure nonsense.<BR>What I can't understand is how overrated this book was. Even English majors I know gave me positive accounts of this book.
B00009TB5G|3.0|When I first saw it in December, two years ago. I actually thought that the first 'Lord of the Rings was better. When I left the theater it seemed that few of the scenes were pretty broing, and not as much work in the characters then the first. But when I bought the Extended Version dvd, it gave me a, real good backround of the whole thing. 'Cause when I saw it in theaters, it felt like bits of pieces were missing. Then again, all in all, I think there was more effort put into the first one. I had recently seen 'Return of the King, and the war scenes were much better than the first, and second. - 3.5 stars
B00007BHOE|5.0|Hi there! I had read all the reviews here and this was the only thing my Slipknot collection lacked, I was searching it everywhere. Finally, I bought it today. Damn it, I can't describe the moment I laid my hands on it. <BR>Let me tell you something: Joey's drum solo is worth all the money and much much more!!! Plus Spit it Out live performance is great. I can't keep myself from jumping around the house each time I listen it.<BR>Anyway, a must have for any &quot;Maggot&quot;!!!
1400034779|4.0|I read this book, then the second one (Tears of the Giraffe), and can't wait for the next one. Alexander McCall Smith has captured a character who stands not alone, but who represents womanhood and hopefully those of modern Botswana. Having never been to Africa it was a delightful opportunity to read of someone else's descriptive manner at detailing a storyline around a whole of their people. Since I do not have any experience to this observation, let it suffice to say that it intrigued me and kept me reading. The main character was just that, a character. Her life and that of the simple life around her was developed in such a manner that I wanted to find out more of how she thought, lived, and developed her detective agency in such a place. Her main male interest was charming as well. He had pride, depth, and honesty when often we think of those we don't know in far away places as perhaps not being as morale as we believe ourselves to be. It was eye-opening, interesting, and worth the read.<br />The sad part was reading some viewpoints from readers who found the book not a &quot;great&quot; detective novel. They missed the point entirely. Her neighbors and clients were charming folks with lives that had simple fears, hopes, and dreams. What more could a reader ask than to have a glimpse into their lives.<br />Read on folks, the second book is as delightful as the first.<BR>Thank you.<br />Reader in California
B00005JME0|5.0|Alright first off, many critics have hated this film for some reason or another.  Who knows, maybe they think it's too shocking, or that it's cliched and hackneyed, but honestly this is one of the best movies i've seen in a long long time.  It's not for everyone i will admit, if you don't think outside the box you won't get this at all, but if you're a deep thinker and love to think what if?  than this movie is right up your alley.  The acting is superb, and the visual effects are mesmerizing, i can't wait for this to come out on dvd, it's a great story, and it teaches a lesson that sometimes we have to let go of the past and look forward to making the future better.  To sum it up, dark, disturbing, and teaches an important lesson about life in general...I loved it.
6300216209|5.0|Love Story is the once-in-a-lifetime love story between a rich Harvard hockey-player Oliver Barrett IV (played by Ryan O'Neal) and smart-mouthed Radcliff gal Jennifer Cavilleri (played by Ali McGraw).  In the movie adaptation of Eric Segal's best selling novel, these two socio economic opposites overcome extreme obstacles to be together.  From their first encounter to the end of the movie viewers are spellbound and in awe of how fiercely they fight to achieve the goals.  At every turn a new obstacle, with every success a struggle, a must see for the romantic at heart.  Director Arthur Hiller does a fantastic job of capturing young love on the big screen.
B00005AQE8|5.0|That's basically all I can say.  This album had something for absolutely everyone.  This showcases 2pac tearing through 27 tracks which included amazing production.  Large amounts of controversy surrounded this album, especially with all the hype and the events that were going on in hip hop in 1996. Events included 2pac being shot, serving a jail sentence and his beef with Biggie and other east coast rappers. The album title said it all.  All eyes were on 2pac that year while this album was in the works. <br />This album included everything from gangster rap to party anthems to more deep personal tracks.  Being that it was recorded after serving a jail sentence, we see the pent up anger that we all expected.  This album was chock full of big hits, including &quot;All about you&quot;, &quot;2 of america's most wanted&quot;, &quot;I ain't mad atcha&quot;, &quot;California Love&quot; (song of the year in '96), &quot;How do you want it&quot; and &quot;Hearts of Men&quot;.  I've never seen so many big hits on one album.  &quot;Life Goes On&quot; is his most personal track on this album.  He goes past the thug inside of him to pull out more emotion like he did on his Me Against the World album.  A few gangster anthems like &quot;Ambitions as a Ridah&quot; showcase his thug image.  In this song he's letting people know that his enemies cower at the site of him.  His dagger-piercing lyrics would be enough to make anyone cower. <br />The underrated second disc contains some more stories. On &quot;Shorty wanna be a thug&quot; he tells a classic story about an adolescent who wants to run the street and grow up to be a thug when he becomes older.  Another one of 2pac's messages letting kids know that you don't have to be a street thug to overcome hardships.  Another personal track, &quot;Holla at Me&quot; tells another story, this one being about an anonymous friend of 2pac's who turned on him. He states &quot;I put some cash in your pocket and made you a man again.. I lost respect for you n---ga, we can never be friends.&quot;  While he doesn't mention who this man is in this story, it's definitly a situation to check out and listen closely to.  <br />I would advise anyone that hasn't heard this masterpiece yet (which is possibly no one) to listen to both discs straight through to get a gist of what 2pac was really going through.  He was a dark and tortured soul and it showed on albums like this one, as well as 7 day theory and me against the world.  Don't forget about Biggie's masterpieces, which were almost as amazing as this masterpiece.
6300216209|5.0|Love Story is the once-in-a-lifetime love story between a rich Harvard hockey-player Oliver Barrett IV (played by Ryan O'Neal) and smart-mouthed Radcliff gal Jennifer Cavilleri (played by Ali McGraw).  In the movie adaptation of Eric Segal's best selling novel, these two socio economic opposites overcome extreme obstacles to be together.  From their first encounter to the end of the movie viewers are spellbound and in awe of how fiercely they fight to achieve the goals.  At every turn a new obstacle, with every success a struggle, a must see for the romantic at heart.  Director Arthur Hiller does a fantastic job of capturing young love on the big screen.
B00005B36H|5.0|not much can be said that hasn't already, but i would only add that some quality headphones enhance a completely seamless musical composition that the world hasn't seen since the classical period. which may explain why other tool albums have been attempted by full orchestras.
B00005QIPH|1.0|nothing more than a quick-fix that has subsequently lost any of the superficial, smarmy charm it momentarily held, is this it now seems tired, dessicated, effete, awfully &quot;studied&quot;, cringe-inducing.<br />julian casablancas' distorted singing voice is infantile and intolerably pretentious.<br />ps why was this ever championed as &quot;the revival of rock&quot;? apart from one or two numbers, there's nothing even vaguely &quot;rocking&quot; about it - for the most part it resembles the sort of hateful, half-baked tinny indie rock stuff that US colleges cooked up thru the mid-90s.<br />awful.
0156027321|5.0|This book is simply an awesome book. I read it and enjoyed it sooooo much. People who say its bad probably didn't get around to reading the entire book. The first part is a little boring, but it picks up a lot from there. I recommend it to anyone who wants to read an almost perfectly created novel.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay made the leap from cloning \\"Pablo Honey\\" to forging their own unique sound in just one album...and deftly avoided the sophomore slump. Improved playing, vastly richer instrumentation, self assured vocals, it all adds up to a really good disc. Opening with the anthemic \\"Politik,\\" very little of the sugary residue that held \\"Parachutes\\" back remains here. In its place is - during the title track - a more worldly stance that would have Chris Martin grasp man's destructive urges in a fit of jealous rage. \\"I'm going to buy a gun and start a war...\\" he mumbles, even though he realizes it's romantic delusions that bring these actions on. It's a moment worthy of Pink Floyd.<br />Such sentiments are also explored on the fantastic \\"The Scientist,\\" which now qualifies as the best expose of IQ Vs hormones since Warren Zevon's \\"Genius.\\" It also builds to a lovely crooning climax. It's Coldplay's best song yet. \\"Clocks,\\" the song following \\"The Scientist,\\" comes pretty darn close to that same level. With a strong piano line and a driving bass, it's pretty obvious as to why this song comes across so strongly on the radio and live.<br />\\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\" is the sound of a band that has found its voice. I can't wait to hear how Coldplay progress from this record on.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera.  What name could evoke more of an image of heavy metal in the 1990's (well, before all the numetal bands ruined that image for what still seems like forever)?  Sure, screaming, swearing, downtuned guitars, all that good stuff had been around for ages before Pantera, but they made it simply a MUST for metal.  And to think, before this album, Pantera had a close resemblance to the endless (*gasp!*) glam-&quot;metal&quot; bands that plagued the '80s!  I have yet to hear this earlier Pantera, but that hardly matters at this point; here, with their 1990 major-label debut, COWBOYS FROM HELL, Pantera proved that THEY, and they alone, were the masters of their game.<br />Four of metal's most-worshipped classic idols are here: Dimebag (here Diamond) Darrell on guitars, Phil Anselmo on vocals, Rex &quot;Rocker&quot; Brown on bass, and Vinnie Paul on drums.  This is such a tight, fierce lineup, and their individual and combined efforts made Pantera one of the most important and original metal bands, ever.<br />This album has many now-classic songs; from the opening title track to the semi-power-ballad &quot;Cemetary Gates,&quot; Pantera's thrashy, furious sound pounds out like nothing else at the time.<br />Sorry I'm being so vague here; perhaps I'll someday edit this review so I get more into this album.  I just needed to acknowledge Pantera's supreme importance and unrivaled power, and until their recent breakup (due to, among other things, a rather rude lack of communication on Phil's part...jerk), they were simply THE seminal heavy metal band in the 1990's.
B000002N2P|5.0|After the huge multi-platinum success of Dookie in 1994, one would think Green Day's follow-up would be happy and poppy. But...they're wrong. On &quot;Insomniac&quot;, Green Day went harder, angrier, and more jaded. And it makes for a great sound.<br />First, Green Day spews out their vitriol on &quot;Armatage Shanks&quot;, a two-minute power-chord-laden ditty featuring lyrics such as &quot;I must insist on being a pessimist / I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind&quot;, and it sounds great. It also gives you a feel for the rest of the album: it's not gettin' any happier, kids. Sure, this ain't The Casualties, but it's not ABBA, either. &quot;Brat&quot; deals with someone waiting for their parents to die so they can inherit their money. &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot; is about speed addiction. &quot;Bab's Uvula Who?&quot; is about just losing your mind.<br />Then there's the biggest hit single, &quot;Brain Stew&quot;. Everybody knows this familiar, simple riff. Then Billie Joe kicks in with, &quot;I'm having trouble trying to sleep / I'm counting sheep but running out&quot;, and more lyrics about insomnia caused by his newborn kid keeping him up with his crying. As the song progresses, it gets a little heavier and a little heavier. Then, for the end, it's the same chords, but heavier, and with bass and drums. And it bleeds right into the next song, &quot;Jaded&quot;. Sweet stuff.<br />Anyway, if you like &quot;Dookie&quot;, check it out. It's a little heavier, but it still has that Green Day goodness.
0385504209|5.0|Having been mildly interested in stories of the Holy Grail after a trip to Rosslyn Chapel in 1999, it was with great anticipation that I finally read THE DA VINCI CODE.  It did not disappointment me in the least.  One hallmark of a good book to me is that it makes me think and makes me read more about something I learned in the book.  I have already read two of the books mentioned in TDC (those in Teabing's library), and as a domino effect, have bought several others.  But this book is not a history book or a book on art appreciation although it does make it even more interesting if you are interested in those things.  It is a first-rate thriller.  I wasn't able to figure out the villain until it was revealed to the reader (having been totally wrong in who I had guessed it to be).  Of course the scenes at Rosslyn Chapel really came to life as I had remembered it.  My book group read this and I wholeheartedly recommend it as a book group selection. We had our best discussion ever, I shared photos of Rosslyn Chapel and Westminster Abbey while another member brought books she purchased at the Louvre.  I can't say enough good things about this book.  My husband read it right after I finished (right after he read Brown's ANGELS AND DEMONDS).  This book justly deserves all the attention it has been receiving and justly deserves its place on top of the bestseller lists.
B000002UB3|5.0|Talk about going out on a good note (no pun intended), the Beatles outdid themselves on Abbey Road.  I always say that the sign of a really great album is if you can let it play all the way through and don't have  desire to skip to the next track.  This CD pulls you in and doesn't let you go until it's ready to let you go.  John rocks your socks off with &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;I Want You (She's so heavy)&quot; and Paul weaves together a beautiful finale (&quot;Golden Slumbers/Carry that Weight/The End&quot;).  George also truley comes out on his own with his two best songs he's ever written (&quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;) on one album!  Even Ringo gets a song in with &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;.  It's a great album and a wonderful swan song for the Beatles.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As stated over and over we had just a glimpse of what Firefly could have become. There was hardly any advertising and no nuturing by the Fox network to better the number of viewers. On top of that the introductory episodes were not shown until the &quot;end&quot; of the season. It's disheartening to see a good show go by the wayside. Even worse, it happened when the series was really coming together. This DVD collection changes all this by letting folks notice, for the first time or once again, the true originality of Firefly. The story- a seemingly ridiculous mixture of sci-fi and western genres worked well. There were a few bumps here and there but overall the episodes flowed nicely. The casting was different and inspired. Each actor portrayed depth and a reason for being part of the crew. Wisely, a since of mystery surrounded each character making them that much more interesting. The sets were not antiseptic (typical of most space operas) but lived in and dingy. The changes in locale from space to western countryside were seemless.<BR>  This collection is fullfilling to watch. I hope that someday to see the rebirth of Firefly that is said to be in the works. I don't like referring to it in the past tense!
B000089RV6|5.0|Forget the friggin' back story. As soon as the blues chording of &quot;Hells' Bells&quot; start climbing over the tolling of that massive liberty bell intro to this classic album, things don't let up for a moment. Even the slightly off songs would sound incredible on someone else's hard rock album. This was AC/DC at their surliest, snarlingest and most threatening best. You can scan the radio dial of classic rock stations in any city and chances are there will be a song from &quot;Back In Black&quot; playing somewhere on the dial.<br />That the album really was AC/DC's triumph over adversity just makes the legend all the more satisfying, because songs that celebrate rock in the way &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; only come along once a decade. (Even this band couldn't make it strike twice, &quot;For Those About to Rock&quot; never measured up to this album for me.) The remaster job makes it all the more worthwhile. &quot;Back In Black&quot; is now louder, nastier and (be it possible) cleaner than ever. Turning it to 10 makes it sound, to qouthe Spinal Tap, like just one more.<br />I think this might be the fourth time I've laid out the cash for this album. Do I feel had? Not in the least. Melt your face off rock never came any better. Still doesn't. 'Nuff Said.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|First of all, this movie is not \\"slap your knees\\" hilarious. It is a subtle comedy with humor implied by a passing glance such as it in reality.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen are terrific together.  The main character is Bob Harris(Bill Murray), a past his hay-day actor and is \\"lost in life's translation\\" as he cruises through life. He chooses to further his career by doing a whiskey ad for the Japanese.<br /> Bob Harris is disenchanted with life in general& the choices he's made such as his young counterpart, Scarlett Johansen's character, Charlotte. Both are married to different people, stuck in situations where no one understands them, and are truely lonely. The choices they have made in life created the kind of lonely that makes a crowded room full of people you know seem foreign.  The film creates this moment in time feeling that fate meant for these two characters to meet and realise that they are not alone. Even though they are \\"strangers\\" they recognize that they are soul mates.  This movie is not cheapened with a may-december love thing , it is a coming of age , sometimes funny , sometimes sad look at life.<br />I enjoyed this movie.
B000063DFQ|3.0|I may be bursting a lot of Iron Maiden fans bubbles, but Piece of Mind isn't as monumental of an album as it is cracked up to be. Don't get me wrong, it's still is good solid album and I like it. Basically Piece of Mind is a carbon copy of Number of the Beast. As with carbon copies, the copy comes out more faded and blurred. The same is here with Piece of Mind. Maybe it was because Number of the Beast was Maiden's first real breakthrough success and they felt better to play it safe and basically copy that album again. The result was Piece of Mind. It created a few great songs, a couple of mediocre ones, and a few flubs. Basically Piece of Mind is a good solid album. Not great, but not bad. Maiden would do worse and they would do much better. Piece of Mind ranks with other Maiden albums such as Fear of the Dark and Killers. Those also contain some classics, some average tracks, and some failures.
0316776963|1.0|Some authors are able to write humorous 'autobiographical' novels that really capture the attention. David Sedaris does NOT fall into that category. Me Talk Pretty One Day is more like the inane ramblings of a 12 year old than the work of a supposed comic genius.<br />The first half of the book seems utterly pointless, badly thought through and amateurishly written - there is probably good material here, although Sedanis falls victim of his own misplaced self-belief that he is a writer, with purile observations that are badly structured and poorly conveyed.<br />Interestingly, the second half of the book improves immeasurably, written far more wittily and in a much more mature and thougtfully amusing style ... although he's still not a &quot;comic genius&quot; as the back cover would lead us to believe.
B000002UDB|5.0|Magical Mystery Tour, albeit being a less than stellar movie, is an absolutley AMAZING album.  The title song of the main title is energetic and unlike any Beatle song you can compare it to.  &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot; is a beautiful Paul ballad that really makes you feel for him.  &quot;Flying&quot; is the instrumental number from the movie.  Not great, but not cringe inducing.  Then there's George's &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;...I don't know what to say about this song other then it grows on you.  &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; is a fun little number in the style of &quot;When I'm 64&quot; or &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;.  Then there is &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;, my favorite Beatles song of all time and is worth buying the album alone just for this one song.  This song will absolutley blow your mind away.  &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; is not featured in the film, but is a great song to have on this CD.  &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is next and of course it's the sound that took the Beatles from 1966 to 1967.  Then there is Paul's &quot;Penny Lane&quot; which has become a timeless classic.  Then there is &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man&quot; and should be listened to for Paul's bass playing alone if anything.  Lastly there is &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; which is the timeless 60's love/hippy/flowers anthem.  Look at the collection of songs on this album!  It's like a greatest hits CD almost.  If you're in the market to buy Beatles albums, make sure this one is a part of your purchases!
B000000H48|5.0|I cannot possibly heap enough praise on this piece of exalted genius. This is easily one of the best five albums ever recorded (ABIGAIL, also by KD, is another), and it might even be THE best. It's as close to perfect as music can get. The songwriting is incredibly innovative and complex, yet hooky and catchy at the same time with some of the most awe-inspiring ever written. Also, if you're a guitarist and you don't own this album, then kick yourself for me because this CD is packed with incredibly intense, fast, and even beautiful lead playing by two of metal's finest (and tragically underrated) guitarists, Andy LaRocque and Pete Blakk. (Incidentally, Blakk hasn't been a member of this band for a long time, but his newest replacement, Mike Wead, is similarly outstanding.) Their lead playing here is worthy of Malmsteen or Vai, only LaRocque's and Blakk's solos are played on top of riffs that are far heavier and darker than anything those other guys have done. The bass and drums are also very strong, and King's voice is right on the mark, even though some people take a while to get used to his extreme range (he'll use a falsetto, then a deep growl, then mid-range, then falsetto again, etc.). As for the lyrics, they basically tell a story, much like a metallic opera -- anyone curious about them can, of course, find them on the web with any search engine. Finally, the production is flawless, with perfect sound quality throughout the album.<br />One caveat: King Diamond's stuff is pretty complicated and might not &quot;sink in&quot; right away, so don't judge it after listening to it only once. Listen to it a few times over a week or so, and then you'll be hooked forever.<br />In short, this album will blow your mind. If you are a metal fan and you don't own this, then you do NOT know what you're missing.
B0000508U6|3.0|I'll be probably the 300'th person on Amazon to make the Coldplay to Radiohead comparison, but I'll also throw in a couple of other lightweight Brits that jumped on the Radiohead train. Starsailor and Travis both jump to mind, and frankly I have yet to add any of their material to my collection. Why? Because those bands are lamer than swamp moss and just about as exciting. The good thing about Coldplay's &quot;Parachutes&quot; is that they have a knack for memorable songs. &quot;Yellow&quot; (while sounding like a happy Thom Yorke during &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;) has a hook that sticks in your head and can't let go. &quot;Don't Panic&quot; also serves up a peppy opener with an upbeat choral refrain.<br />At the same time, Coldplay has another band to feed off of, and that's Pink Floyd. &quot;Spies&quot; comes from the PF handbook for moodiness, as does &quot;Everything's Not Lost.&quot; I had this CD well before the far superior &quot;Rush Of Blood To the Head&quot; appeared, and the band improved immeasurably between here and there. So while there are a few really good songs on &quot;Parachutes&quot; and the arrangements are frequently quite beautiful, I really can't call it much better than average. Start with &quot;Blood&quot; and work back, and you'll see what I mean. But if that languid kind of ethereal pop music makes you melt, this will certainly please you.
B00008BXJJ|4.0|This is an  awesome cd. Phil Rudd ( who I should mention isnthe best drummer of akk time) is great. A whole lotta rosie shouldnt been on here but thats the only flaw.
0385504209|1.0|Am I the only reader on this planet who does not think Dan Brown's &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is a wonderful book?  Who thinks, in fact that it is a rather bad book?  Badgered by any number of friends who consider themselves serious readers, I finally broke down and read it myself.  I was underwhelmed.<br />For starters, I don't appreciate lectures in suspense thrillers.  Brown continually interrupts the story to drone on about the history of Paris or London, and, more verbosely, the &quot;history&quot; on which the story is based.  Entire chunks of the book read like a tarted up Michelin guide.<br />Deep into the novel Brown briefly acknowledges his debt to a few religious &quot;history&quot; books, most of which assert claims seriously questioned by scholars.  Presumably Brown wants to assure his readers that he is not making all this stuff up, and that he has spent many tedious hours unearthing this arcane knowledge.  Actually all these books have been available to the public for years.  Evidently relying on the public's short attention span (or impatience with any book containing footnotes), Brown announces all his &quot;revelations&quot; in breathless prose suggesting hot-off-the-press news.<br />Briefly, its main premise is that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, they had a child, or children, and their descendants are alive in France today.  This knowledge is protected by an ancient secret society, the Priory of Sion, loathed by the Vatican for obvious reasons.  One of the Priory's Grand Master's was Leonardo da Vinci.  Great stuff, thought Brown.  The making of a terrific thriller.<br />But wait.  I keep calling &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; a thriller.  True enough, it offers a lot of what thrillers these days strut: cool cars, private planes, luxurious digs, fancy gadgetry, narrow escapes, etc.  The dust jacket, however, announces itself as a novel.  Well, the reader will look in vain for the usual hallmarks of a good novel, namely, well-developed characters in whom the reader takes an interest, and well-turned prose testifying to the author's passion for the language.  I couldn't have cared less what happened to the inane protagonists.  Their conversations are part comic book, part encyclopedia entry, and their adventures are told in a curiously flat, dull style reminiscent of a weather report.<br />Perhaps I wouldn't be so annoyed by this book if it didn't exude such ambitious pretensions.  I caught Brown on a TV talk show, and it seems the man really thinks he has struck a blow for feminist theology.  That's a claim about as ridiculous as the assertion that the James Bond Series is an eloquent plea for democracy.<br />I have no doubt that Brown wrote &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; with the intention of selling the movie rights.  He is already imagining the cast -- Langdon, the main character, is described as &quot;Harrison Ford in Harris tweed.&quot;  Well, doubtless the movie will be better than the book.  I can't envision any actor agreeing to interrupt an adventure to spout a lot of dubious scholarship, or worse, fatuous art criticism.<br />But I pity the script writers.n whom the reader takes an interest, and well-turned prose testifying to the author's passion for the language.

B00000JGOJ|5.0|In a strange turn of events, the ending of 'Playing by Heart' will have you wondering what you missed during the first hour and fifteen minutes of the movie.  The story centers on several pairs of people, four couples, a mother and son and in a very strange and perplexing role, Dennis Quaid playing several different characters in several different scenes.  His work in these scenes shines and harkens back to his glory days, reassuring us that his career is not over by any means.  Another stand out role is Angelina Jolie, in one of her first appearances.  She absolutely radiates and steals every scene, leaving Ryan Philipee and his subtle performance in the dust.  Not that it's a bad thing.  Her character is sassy and full of life, where his is downtrodden, solitary and dark.  Other stories involve a married couple approaching their 40th anniversary dealing with mortality and a bad memory from the past.  Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart play career individuals who are trying to get through awkward moments of their first dates.  It's nice to see Anderson play a role that is insecure and troubled rather then her well known persona on X-Files where she is strong and confident.  The stories play out their seperate plots and eventually climax with a emotional and uplifting finale that makes anyone whos ever been in a relationship feel something for all these people.  I highly recommend this movie.
0679731725|4.0|Having received the Booker Prize and popularized into a movie, The Remains of the Day yet remains the most under-rated novel of the 20th century. This is an exquisite novel about humility and abnegation; narrated by a butler who must re-assess the worthiness of his career upon his employer's death.<br />Written in eloquent English (by the Japanese author Ishiguro), the novel is a re-account of what transpired some twenty years ago to the butler Mr. Stevens and head housekeeper Mrs. Kenton, during an important political conference hosted by their employer, Mr. Darlington. In the novel's present, Stevens is on a drive through England to re-unite with Kenton, in order to ask her to come back to work under the new owner at Darlington Hall, an American named ****. The chronological dichotomy between past and present symbolizes promise and failure, respectively. Stevens' drive into the past is a metaphor for regret, epitomized by the breaking down of his car.<br />The novel broaches upon two major themes: Stevens' repressed love for Mrs. Kenton, and his Ego, lived vicariously through his perception of his employer Darlington. There are a myriad of beautiful meditations on loyalty, greatness, and discipline. Stevens basis his entire moral structure on his belief that, by helping a great man do great things, he is indirectly changing the course of history. When it turns out that Darlington was a nazi sympathizer, Stevens cannot admit to himself his own failure (however self-induced), which only instigates a deeper qualm, that of love unrequited.<br />The most endearing scene is when Mrs. Kenton ventures unannounced into Stevens' private room, in an amorous attempt to solicit Stevens' affection, whereby Stevens backs awkwardly into the corner. She pries the book he is reading out of his hands, which turns out to be a girlish love story. This exposure leaves Stevens horrified, to the reader's empathy and sheer delight.<br />What gives the novel so much emotional breadth and psychological complexity is that Stevens never really talks about how he feels. In fact, his account of what happened is focused only on daily rituals like chores, maintenance, and meal services. He fixates on micro-managing everything, as it becomes obvious that Stevens is in denial of all the palpable and imminent things around him: Love, Passion, and Death (his father, who he hires as a servant, dies). Yet Stevens' hardness and stoicism is so convincing and likable, that readers become convinced that things are exactly as our Stevens perceives them.<br />One New York Times critic has a famous narrator `likability' test that measures the success of a book on the mentioned attribute. I can say with relief, celebration, and deep conviction that Mr. Stevens is the most likable character I've ever read, with his obstinate tranquility and ridiculous rationality, for (as readers will come to see and love), Stevens is truly far deeper than that.
B00004RF97|5.0|The Philadelphia Story is one of my all time favorites.  The casting of the 3 leads is wonderful.The role of Tracy Lord was tailor-made for Katharine Hepburn.  She plays the part with the perfect balance of haughty arrogance and vulnerability.  Cary Grant is snappy and sexy andJames Stewart is charming and loveable.  This has been remade several times but has never been improved upon.
B0001906O0|5.0|You might notice as you go through the myriad reviews of &quot;Join the Dots&quot; that different people like different discs best in this 4-CD retrospective of rarities &amp; B sides.  That is clue #1 of just how solid this set is--big time Cure fans all, and we each find something different to love in this fantastic set.  How often have you plopped down the dough for a box set (especially rarities &amp; B's) and found the majority of what you hear just interesting, in an archeological find kind of way?  How many of those sets can you whole-heartidly recommend to ga-ga fans and mild fans alike (Recent Guided by Voices box comes to mind -- great set, but if you're not already into the band, I could see you grimace a bit &amp; say, &quot;What the hell is this stuff?&quot;).  Well, &quot;Join the Dots&quot; finds The Cure releasing that rare monster box of oddities that is just so immediately great, it won't matter your level of Cure fandom.  Honestly, even you if just sorta like this band, I can see you getting way into this.  Very few week spots, and strong tunes abound.  Divided chronologically, the set takes you from the early years to present day, and each disc is full of nuggets.  It seems that with each listen, each disc gets stronger &amp; the set as a whole gels even more.  So, if you're looking for a good way to suddenly feel good about those winter doldrums (doesn't this band have an odd knack for making misery feel great?), delve into this awesome box set by The Cure.  Robert Smith &amp; his boys have really delivered with something special, and you won't be sorry.
B00009L1OB|3.0|On the one hand, this is Simon LeBon's best lyrics on any of the DD's efforts. Each song is like an enigma, each one-upping the next. Particular greats are Shadows on Your Side and Seventh Stranger, and yet the songs themselves aren't very catchy and tend to become more like wet noodles mixed with keyboards. Sad too, because right off the bat with the Reflex you would never guess the fate of the following tracks. Oddly dark, yet not very energetic. This is the type of album a band puts out at about the 10th go-around, not at this juncture of their career. Hard to tell what they were going for and while all the pieces seem to be in place I can't shake the mental image of a band all ready to go out the front door and yet looking for the car keys at the same time. Great cd for Simon fans but John Taylor fans better look to the past, there are no New Religion bass lines here, and the only thump you'll hear is from the overly used percussion.
B0000C16OQ|1.0|This &quot;deluxe&quot; edition is record label price gouging at its worst!<br />Just about everyone who loves the movie and this movie soundtrack album has already bought the first pressing, so to make the reissue more appealing a 2nd disc of bonus materials has been added.<br />Don't get suckered in by this.<br />The main disc repeats the one flaw from the original release in that the songs are still all jumbled and nowhere near the order they are heard in the film. You would think that the label would have corrected this but they didn't.<br />The second disc is short (about 40 minutes) and just features alternate takes and remixes of the same songs.  Nothing new there.<br />One star may seem a bit harsh..bear in mind I give the original release 4 stars.
B000092ZYX|5.0|this cd is amazing.  I bought it about 7 months ago and i'm still trying to listen to the cd in full.  the mourning vocals make the music seem to drag at times, but if your patient you get some very cool driving beats.  This is a must get for any radiohead fan!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie is no exception. From what I can see... you love it or you hate it. I loved it. Some people I know hated it.<br />Derek Zoolander is stupid, but funny. Him and Hansel are both models and competeing. It has it's moments. It may not be movie of the year, but it definitely had it's moments. The walk-off, mine scene, and numerous others had me laughing alot.<br />Rent this one. It's a real test to see if you like moronic humor.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|... on second thoughts, DO make me laugh. After all, this film is described as &quot;Hilarious&quot; by Rolling Stone or something. &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot;!<br />Well are you in for a slow-moving piece of mood music. Yes, if you keep in mind that it's about loneliness, etc. and there's a great performance by Bill Murray, and you have a couple of hours to kill without wanting any recompense, go ahead and watch it. It does succeed in immersing you in its molasses-paced arthouse study of whatever it is the critics said it was a study of, but it's hardly hilarious.<br />Sure, Murray might have turned in a great performance. But so what? It's like following a complete stranger around for a week, and not a terribly interesting one at that. His subtle performance is stretched out over too much time.<br />You might have guessed I don't have much patience for movies that don't go anywhere in two hours. You might also have guessed I'm not paid to watch stuff like this, but instead have to pay for the privilege. All I know is, I didn't enjoy it much, and I want my money back.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This movie was very powerful, very sad at times, sometimes uplifting, and a seemingly accurate account. It focuses on the life of a man who avoids being sent to the death camps of Nazi Germany during WWII, and the struggles he goes through. Very powerful, actors/director did a great job. Something I appreciate: it was based on the accounts of a man who lived during the time.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I am not writing about the DVD because no one here did.  I am writing about the version I watched in theatres.<br />---MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS---<br />When I first heard that The Matrix would become a trilogy I said, \\"well, it's couldn't be THAT bad...\\".  Man oh man, was I wrong...<br />Obviously, criticism is purely based on matter of fact unless one is paied to do so.  Then it's matter of observation.<BR>I BELIEVE this to be the single worst film in the history of movies, which makes The Matrix: Revolutions the second worst (yes, I have watched the third one).  I have watched both (second and third) because, otherwise, I would not allow myself to criticise them.<br />The cgi in movies, up to date, is still crawling toward the DECENT level.  I have never watched a film's cgi that looked appropriate.  In order for cgi to be good it must not be noticible.  The audience must ask, 'how did they do that?!'  When it's noticible, the director did a bad job.  It's very simple.<BR>And, clearly, the Watchowski Brothers are the best example of that, and of money being thrown into a turbine.  Why not invest it all in the stock market?<br />The story is missing in this film, unlike the first one.  That is because it contradicts itself.  Watch the film a second time and listen to the Architect's speaches.  He contradicts everything spoken so far, in the first and second films, and makes fun of the audience in the manner that everything that made sense (and what made fans want to see this film) not longer is needed.  If Neo needed to do something, forget it.  He now needs to do something completly different, and leaning toward another pathetic attempt at a plot point (plot sucks; stories are what makes movies, and plots can not exist without stories).  If he needed to speak to someone, that someone does not know enough.  The next person doesn't enough either.  Etcetera, etcetera...<br />One too many new charaters were pointlessly inserted into this film.<BR>Who are the Albino Rastafarians and what is their purpose?  And if they're important, why are they destroyed after twenty minutes?<BR>What's so special about the Key Master if he's got a boss Neo can talk to?<BR>Why does Neo swing his arms and create ripples in order to fly?<BR>Why is Neo no longer powerful and Morpheus, who is pointless in this film, is more powerful than The Agents?<BR>Why is Trinity a vigelante?  Where's the team work?  And what about helping Neo?<BR>Why does Zion look like a cruddy, steel encrusted, stench of a hole in the ground?<BR>Why are the machines using human being's body heat for power when they can build power plants just like the humans did, only better?<BR>Why is it that Neo can stop bullets but not people?  Are all his enemies avatars?  No.  Sorry, that point is explained.<br />That is only a small fraction of the questions that I have in mind, and that is after viewing the entire triogy.<br />Also, any philosophical notions mentioned are nothing more than figments of philosopical ideals, strictly taken from a Philosophy 101 textbook.  If one needs to know why The Matrix is the essence of Buddhism and the real world is the essence of Christianity, please look it up.  It is a very serious mistake that The Brothers made.  They provide you with what you need to ask the internet.<BR>Also, after reading up on the Göedel Theorum (yes, I read up for the last film), I understood certain notions are ideals.  I also managed to predict the outcome of the third film's purpose, and its charaters' meanings and purposes.<BR>All of that was done four months before I had viewed The Matrix: Revolutions.<br />Two final questions: Why is the second film titled Reloaded?  what is being reloaded?  Certainly not the guns...  They never have.<BR>And the second question is, why is the third film titled Revolutions?  There aren't any.  The humans do not revolt, the machines do; but The Brothers take over the side of the humans...<BR>Why is that?  Especially since it's a lose-lose situation...<br />The humans have 250,000 civilians and the machines send 250,000 units (they have hundreds of millions more back at the machine city).  Basically it's a slaughter of the human race, except to those who hide very well.<br />When Neo realises that he and Smith exist because they are opposits, that explains why they are attarcted to each other.  But it doesn't explain why they need to fight.  Especially since Neo explains that if one of them is alive, the other can not die.  Therefore Neo sacrifices himself and that destroys Smith as well.  But...  1)If they were doomed from the beginning, why should we watch the third film?  The Watchowskies made fun of us all by milking our money.  We paid to see a battle that ends in favour of both sides losing because, otherwise, they would both be alive forever and battle eachother forever.  See?  LOSE-LOSE.  They both die or they fight each other forever to no avail.<BR>2) Smith, by the end of the third film, has the entire world (within the Matrix) clones of himself.  They are all as powerful as the next, except the original one.  But when Smith dies, just after Neo, all the Smiths are destroyed.<BR>NEWSFLASH: All the human beings bread by the machines in the machine city are hooked up to the Matrix; it is their life support.  This Smith does not borrow the human's bodies, he turns them all to clones of himself.  So Neo destroyed all the hukan is the machine city and everyone inside the Matrix.  WHY?  Who's left?  Morpheus, Niobi, and twenty other?  WHY ARE THEY LEFT TO SUFFER FOR EVERYONE WHOSE DEAD?<BR>3) Why did Trinity have to die?  You know what?  Here's a better question; I know that The Brothers like philosophy, so: when Trinity is impaled and is dying, Neo says \\"You can't die...\\" and she respond with the slap-in-the-face remark of \\"Oh, yeah?  Watch me.\\"  And then she dies.<BR>WHY?!!!<br />Basically, I really detest the way the Watchoskies have ended this monstrocity of a trilogy, I hate the way they wastedtheir money (and you can't say they didn't because the acting sucked and the effects were horrible), and that they entirely adapted it all from many other movies and anime titles.<br />P.S.<BR>These three films are made up from the stories and sequences of the following: The Terminator, Virtuosity, Strange Days, X (an anime series that I love), Dragonball Z (another anime series, but one that I hate), Neon Genesis Evangelion (another very good anime series), and there are a few more that have currently slipped my mind.  If anyone else remembers any other films or anime that I have forgotten to mention, please feel free to add them to this list.<br />Thank you.<br />D.
B00004RF9B|5.0|I love this movie, as many before me, i used to watch it as a kid on TV, and the DVD is a good one to have, i think what some people are forgetting that this DVD is probaly one of the earlier DVD's put out on the market lots of DVD's in the beginning didnt offer as many &quot;Extras&quot; as everone has come to expect in DVD's present day, and some moves based on there age range may infact not have many extras to have on a DVD now days, it depends on the age of the movie and how much archival material is present, not to mention if its print wise worthy to include, and this DVD has both versions the &quot;Panned and scanned version mostly referd to today as &quot;Full Screen&quot; and the &quot;Widescreen Version&quot; some just need to take the time to look at the disk features,
156898443X|5.0|EVERYDAY MATTERS is never far from me, and always a source of inspiration.  Danny's writing is engaging and funny and sad and wonderful, and never solipsistic or maudlin --  it's a really generous book, actually, and affecting in unexpected ways.  I've been telling everyone I know, and then giving them copies.   This book should be read by anyone going through a transition in their life, by every artist, by everyone who needs a reminder to stop and observe and be.  Incredible.
B000031WD9|5.0|Once again, it has been proven to me NOT to listen to the advice of others, ESPECIALLY when it comes to movie. American Pie is a great flic, period. The other reviewers in Amazon who reviewed this movie need to get a sense of humor and realize there is more to this movie than just the humor. Maybe those reviewers have been out of high school for too long, but this movie is ABOUT GROWING UP. I know that I experienced many similar situations growing up in this movie, such as what your buddies say and how you really feel; being yourself, and experimenting with realitionships.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|In this movie, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen play two lonely people set adrift on the flotsam and jetsam of Tokyo. Sounds good enough. But unfortunately, it doesn't work, let me explain why.<br />It's kind of funny, everyone I know who likes this film is a Vin Diesel fan - they all like Triple X and the Fast and the Furious and this movie. Now, you may say, what do those movies have in common? <br />Well, they all subvert intelligence in favor of looks. This movie plays heavily (entirely) on the fact that Americans (I am one myself) are easily, like Nebraskans going to New York City for the first time, blown away by Tokyo. So basically, all you have to do is throw a bunch of flashy shots of Tokyo on the screen, and guar-un-teed, people will sit there with their jaws gaping going &quot;This is amazing!&quot;<br />Well my friends. I have lived in many different countries around the world and it takes more than some Roppongi glitz or Shinjuku eminence to impress me. No offense to others who are impressed.<br />Secondary to Tokyo (Tokyo may as well be billed as the main actor) is the handcart of bittersweet conventions pushed through the movie. Yawn. This movie feels like I've seen it before. Oh yes, I have, it's much like any other lovers in a foreign city movie. Bill Murray plays a sad, black humorous, defeated old man, much like Jack Nicholson did in About Schmidt. These sad old men rules are always shoo-ins for the big awards, I'm wondering why anyone can't see through this.<br />Film school students will talk your ear off about what all those wistful shots of people doing nothing mean. What it means is this movie is boring and film school students like to be pretentious. Yawn.<br />So, in conclusion, I would not recommend this film. I know, I know, I DARED, that's right, I DARED to give this film one-star, so I know everyone has to get hysterical with outrage and click &quot;Not Helpful.&quot; Go ahead and retaliate in that weak fashion, deep down you all knowI'm right about this film, and it scares you to death.
B00008AWOD|5.0|I don't typically review CD's on-line, so this will be brief. I'm giving this a five for one reason: I'm on buying this CD for the 2nd time because I wore out my first copy. Enough said.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|After reading some of the reviews for this album I cannot understand how some of the reviewers are saying it should've been called &quot;Buckingham-Nicks II&quot;. What about Mick Fleetwood and John McVie? Didn't those reviewers hear the drums, the bells, the driving bass...all working together perfectly with the melodys &amp; harmonies of Stevie &amp; Lindsay?  I feel the musicianship of this album is almost unparalleled.  You can hear the quality of the band and the recording down to the smallest details with the usual little FM touches throughout every track.  It made me realize why these people are who they are...again.  The album DOES grow on you - not only because of the quality but also I believe due to the hard work that obviously went into the album that comes out as you listen as if a perfectionist had put it all together for you while rolling out the red carpet for your enjoyment. I believe that's not only Lindsay Buckingham's work ethic and philosophies we're hearing but It's also Stevie Nicks, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood doing what they do best.  More creative than past works - this album does have about at least 6 to 8 good pop rock songs with the balance of songs being of a high quality creative mix.  This album ROCKS with the famous Fleetwood Mac melodies on the pop rock tracks and is quite thoroughly entertaining and even mesmerizing on the creative fare. I definitely got my moneys worth and a lot more... THANK YOU FLEETWOOD MAC!
0140386335|5.0|Today's new fantasy seems to have gone from books and movies to video games. Now we have so-called fantasy games on the Playstation 2 with women singing with microphones like pop stars. Absolutely annoying rubbish.<br />Fantasy isn't about anime video games or catching previews on the sci fi channel among comercials or collecting trading cards and buying the foil editions on ebay. Let's go to the core basics.<br />Fantasy is about imagination. It should be a pleasurable escape. Remeber the Arthurian tales? Hanzel and Gretel? Rapunzel? Jack and the Beanstalk? Think medieval, not anime.<br />That's why I think this book, THE NEVERENDING STORY, is one of the greatest ever written. Even after watching the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies, this book is a great escape. You don't need to study European history or Greek mythology to understand this book. You don't need to buy a video game system or follow the anime crowd. All you need is this book, from amazon or hopefully the local library carries a copy(beware if it's a large hardcover with a golden snake on it!), and some free time and you'll remember what fantasy used to be and still is today. True, absolute fantasy.
B000088E6D|2.0|I bought this CD impulsively after sampling a few tracks at a listening station at Barnes and Nobles.  In the mood for a new CD or singer, I bought it.  My first reaction was &quot;WOW!  How come I never heard of this guy?&quot;  After listening to the whole thing at home, I thought &quot;Hmm not bad&quot;  Upon a few more listenings my opinion has fallen to &quot;YAWN!  Another overly hyped wanna-be&quot;  Truly great singers of standards offer so much more depth than this guy can deliver.  You can listen to the truly greats over and over and over and they never grow tired, and most actually improve over the test of time.  Trust me, this guy won't be one of them.  He is merely mimicking the style, not offering it up with credibility.  Diana Krall?  THERE is the real thing.  Listen to Sinatra right after little Michael and you will hear it- IF that is, you are listening with your EARS.
B000001IQH|5.0|Of all my cds this is one of my all time favorites, i would recommend this to almost anyone, it's punk and ska and a little everything eles. When i first bought this cd it wasn't all that appealing to me, but when i listened to it again i was amazed, The vocals were rough and sang with energy the guitar parts were awesome and the bass parts were even better, I hate it when people tell blink 182 fans to not buy this cd or good charlotte fans it doesn't matter, It's good music and it shouldn't be hidden away from the world because of some whiny punks hating to have their bands listened to. I recomend this to EVERYONE Even britany spears fans, It's an awesome album.<BR>Sheer energy<BR>I also recommend Let's go as it's an awesome album too.
B000002N9L|4.0|This &quot;Intended 4 private use only&quot; C.D. Isn't that Bad, It takes a Few Listens but you start getting it,  This Was an obvious way for prince to get back at his former Record Company WB,  The Fans who like Prince's Glitter and gold stage will be sadly disappointed,  Prince spouts Raw Expression with these Album, spouting dumb catch phrases like &quot;I Rock, therefore I am&quot; But still its great!,  From the catchy Dinner With Delores to the Outro Had U,  This is what Prince sounds like when he goes back to basics<BR>Great For Parties<BR>injoy
B0001BKAEE|4.0|I don't know and care what people say about this movie being a dissapointment. If anything is a dissapointment, the 2nd one is. When I first saw this movie in the theatres, I thought it was awesome! But when people say this was a bad movie, that's just a bad opinion. If any movie watchers of the Matrix series loved the storyline of the 1st movie but the action packed sci-fi special effects in the 2nd one, the 3rd one is both, combined. I won't give anything away of the climactic ending of the movie but it is AWESOME!!! Probably the best action sequence I've seen in any movie getting rid of the fact that it's 90% computerised. If you're interested in seeing the huge ending to the series, I highly suggest to see it.
B000002HJR|5.0|Best line-up on an album, ever. Phil Anselmo. Pepper Keenan. Kirk Windstein. Todd Strange. Jimmy Bower. This album takes ages to get into. But once your there you can't get it out of your CD player. I love this album. I can't get enough of it. Its a lot better than Down II. This is, next to Black Sabbath 'Master of reality', one of the best Doom Metal albums of all time. The inlay of the booklet gives you the best feel of the album. 5 dudes hanging around in the sun, making some kick ass tunes. New Orleans swamp metal. Chemically-depressed Stoner Rock. Doom. This band started off making some underground tapes. But beccause they were so good, they went on to make a great album. This is some very heavy guitar riffs with some mellow acoustic songs. Please check out this cd. Its so good.
B000001IPP|5.0|This is an awesome album i hope EVERYONE can get a chance to listen to this music, I'm not a punk-pop fan but let the kids be, If they like it they like it and i think they have every right to listen to all rancid out there, it would definatly amaze them and i think any one out there who is anyone could learn to love rancid. They are rough and in your face and it just makes you want to get up and move. <BR>Before you buy this album i really recommend And out come the wolves first if you don't have any of their albums, Rancid is amazing and i hope more people can learn to appreciate how good this band is.
B00005K3OT|3.0|People raved about this movie and I sat there and felt like I missed something.  It was a good story line.  That acting was okay.  Some of the characters weren't really devolped very well.  It was disappointing.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|A Perfect Circle is a band, that is full of such talent, not only in the guitars, but on the vocals, and lyrics as well. This album is full of great lyrics. The music is absolutely great as well, and Maynards vocals are some of the best i've ever heard. 'Thirteenth Step' is by-far the best hard rock release of 2003.<br />1. The Package -8-Good Song to Start off the album. Long, not many lyrics.<BR>2. Weak and Powerless -10- One of the Best. Lyrics are superb.<BR>3. The Noose -10- One of the Best. Lyrics, the haunting music makes for one great song.<BR>4. Blue -9- May take a while to like this song. But it is a good song.<BR>5.  Vanishing -8- Good Music, hard drum beats.<BR>6. A Stranger -8- Music is great. Maynards vocals are superb.<BR>7. The Outsider -10- Love the music in this one, lyrics are maybe the best. <BR>8. Crimes -8- Really just a filler, but still alright to listen to.<BR>9. The Nurse who Loved me -10- Weird, haunting. Music is great, just kind of mello.<BR>10. Pet -9- Music is great. Guitars, drums. Lyrics are also key on this one.<BR>11. Lullaby -8- Really just a filler.<BR>12. Gravity -9- Love the chorus, the music is also superb.
B0000020C4|5.0|After three failed attempts (London, Broadway, Complete Symphonic) at finding a good actress for this part, here's one who has the perfect combination of voice and emotion.  Squeeky-voiced Frances Ruffele should feel lucky: she woudn't have been cast (and wouldn't have eventually won a Tony on Broadway) had Lea Salonga been around to audition for the role in the mid80s!
B00005JMTN|3.0|We all know the plot of Big Fish. Father tells crazy stories, son thinks his father is full of crap, then son comes to realize he is a retard. well, something like that...  =p<br /><br />I really respect and love Tim Burtons movies. Pee Wee's Big Adventure wouldn't have been great without Tim. Tim even took a dumb silly comic like Batman and made it cool. Not only did he make great movies, but they are still great now and stand the test of time.<br /><br />Unfortunatly because Tim is so great, people are going to exagerate and pretend that this film is a masterpiece. Much like the plot of the movie, they will create their own big fish and tell people that this is the greatest film in the world. Unfortunaly this film is less a big beautiful fish and more like a big dead shad for adults!<br /><br />Kids will like this film. Adults who can be unbias from liking Tim Burton will not like this film as much as kids. Not only was the casting bad, but the acting was silly. People smiled so much in the stories, I wasn't sure if I was watching Big Fish or an Enzyte commercial.<br /><br />Somewhere deep in space their is a box labeled overated garbage. In that box you will find KILL BILL, LORD OF THE RINGS, and BIG FISH.<br /><br />acting=3.5 stars<br />ending=3.5 stars<br />Directing and Editing=2 stars<br />storyline=4 stars<br />replay value=2 stars<br />Music=NA<br /><br />OVERALL= SOLID 3 stars<br /><br />As David Spade would say, I liked it the first time.....uh, when it was called Forrest Gump.
0780628551|3.0|I am not particularly drawn to science fiction and being a fan of Johnny Depp's range as an actor, I still had no desire to see this.  It was on one night and my husband wanted to watch it so there I sat, sure I was going to hate it.  I have to tell you that the movie was quite suspenseful and the acting was superb.  I found myself wrapped up in and even afraid of Johnny Depp's character.  I was mildy impressed.  Then came the end.  What a way to ruin a great movie.  So predictable that you didn't even see it coming, because it was such a good film up until that point.  It's like you watched this great movie and the end comes and you're questioning yourself as to why you watched it all.  It was so disappointing.  It's worth watching for the performances and the suspense up until that point.  If you can get over a really lame ending, you might enjoy it.
B000000H42|5.0|I have few CDs in which I can say I just love each and every track. &quot;Don't Break the Oath&quot; is one of those few! From the warnings of disturbing the dead in &quot;Desecration of Souls&quot; to the invitation to a ritual in &quot;Come to the Sabbath&quot;. From the quick pace of &quot;Gypsy&quot; to the slower interlude in &quot;To One Far Away&quot;. While all those are good, my favorite is &quot;The Oath&quot;, a solemn vow to give your soul to Satan! So evil and terrifying that just listening to it once may secure your place in Hell for all eternity! However, the lyrics would be laughable if it weren't for the vocals. The chilling wails of King Diamond take every word of the lyrics, transforms it all into a dagger, and pierces your soul with his one-of-a-kind voice! No one could do it better! Backing up the King are lead guitarists Micheal Denner and Hank Shermann, bassist Timi Hansen and drummer Kim Ruzz, who spare nothing in bringing this perfect dark metal album to life! I strongly recommend &quot;Don't Break the Oath&quot; to anyone interested in classic metal with staying power!
B000002J2D|5.0|Like Duke which follows it, ...And Then There Were Three has a wonderful overall sound and is solid from first track to last.  Here, Gensis showed they were still progressive (the tile of the album refers to the sudden exit of guitarist Steve Hackett) but with a slightly more accessible sound and, at times, even a little darker.  &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; was the single (one of the first &quot;romantic&quot; Genesis songs that attracted a female audience) but that is as &quot;pop&quot; as this album gets.  It starts out with a powerful guitar riff in &quot;Down and Out.&quot;  There are several ballads; they include &quot;Undertow,&quot; &quot;Snowbound,&quot; &quot;Many Too Many,&quot; and &quot;Say It's Alright Joe&quot; (although this one does rock in the middle).  The latter, lyrically, is a little sentimentally overdone &quot;I need another drink, to blow on the glass so I know I'm alive.&quot;  Ironically, &quot;Ballad of Big&quot; is an upbeat track as is the fun, and one of my favorites, &quot;Scenes From a Night's Dream&quot; about a boy named Nimo who eats too much before sleeping and has wild fantasies.  <br />The two monster tracks (each over 6 minutes) offer some of the best material here.  Despite its rather mundane opening, &quot;Burning Rope&quot; has a beautiful, uplifting melody I can't help but hum along to despite the fatalistic, but very well-written, lyrics (&quot;You're old and disillusioned now as you realize at last, that all you have accomplished here will have soon all turned to dust.&quot;).  The Tony Banks penned &quot;The Lady Lies&quot; has a killer closing onslaught of piano.  &quot;Deep in the Motherlode&quot; is also excellent.  In fact, the only track I do not care for that much is &quot;Snowbound&quot; because it is repetitive. I definitely recommend this album to anyone familiar with Genesis' singles of the late 1970s and early 1980s who wants to dive deeper into the Genesis discography.
0385504209|1.0|Lame, clunky, corny, simple, pedestrian, silly, contrived, wooden and that's just the dialogue folks!<br />Don't even get me started on the dopey plot.<br />A truly miserable effort, but hey Brown is crying all the way to the bank.
6304711905|4.0|Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp who has retired from his life as a lawman and who goes to the wild town of Tombstone to make his fortune.  He is accompanied by his wife and his brothers and rejoins his old friend Doc Holliday.  Val Kilmer puts in the best performance of the movie in his portrayal of the self-destructive, high-living Holliday.  Kurt Russell is also good as Wyatt Earp.  There is lots of beautiful scenery and the gorgeous shots of sunrises and sunsets is juxtaposed with the raw violence of the gun battles.  This is a great movie for Western fans.
B000002J27|5.0|The title and cover artwork for this album are as wonderfully whimsical as the music itself.  Each song has a tale to tell which reflects the witty characters on the cover.  A Trick of the Tail was the first post-Peter Gabriel release and the first of the Phil Collins era.  This album is an excellent bridge between the two eras as it has the humorous story-telling of early Genesis material. The fun &quot;Robbery, Assault and Battery&quot; (which included a cute music video) is self explanatory.  The rest may take some listening to grasp the sheer genius of them.  I know I appreciate this album more each time I listen to it.  <br />Every song here is wonderful.  &quot;Ripples&quot; (another single with music video) is a beautiful ballad about the passing of time and youthful beauty that has one of my favorite lines: &quot;Bluegirls come in every size, Some are wise and some otherwise.&quot;  It includes an innovative Steve Hackett guitar solo.  &quot;Mad Man Moon&quot; is also beautiful and clocks in at over 7 minutes.  Fun, fantastical songs like &quot;Squonk&quot; and &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; really make this album enjoyable.  The former is explained as follows: &quot;The Squonk is of a very retiring disposition and due to its ugliness, weeps constantly.  It is easy prey for hunters who simply follow a tear-stained trail.  When cornered, it will dissolve itself into tears.  True or False?&quot;  From the second to the last verse, I would answer &quot;True,&quot; but that is probably too easy.  I read that this track was the first one Daryl Stuermer played when he rehearsed for the touring gig with the band (I guess he passed).  <br />&quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot; was, I believe, the only Tail track to remain in the Genesis live set well into the 1990s.  All the songs are wonderful but my definite favorite is &quot;Entangled;&quot; a cynical look at a medical staff's attempt to revive a dying man: &quot;Well, thanks to our kindness and skill, You'll have notrouble until, You catch your breath and the nurse will present you the bill.&quot;  This album is a musical, lyrical, and artistic masterpiece.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This c.d. has less commercial appeal than Agaetis Byrjun, I think.  It tends to be darker and more repetetive. More intense. Yeah, the singer sounds like he's repeating the same few words over and over again, but hey, it makes it easier to sing along (I DO find my self singing along, if you can imagine such a thing). Like A.B., I love every track on this one, too.  Tracks 2, 4, 5, and 8 stand out for me in particular.  ( ) reminds me of watching the night sky, for some reason. It is heavenly music, but in a different way from A.B. I play this one almost every night, as I'm hanging out, reading, before bed.  I don't think I've ever heard it during daylight hours - it's that kind of c.d.  Also like A.B., this is great f**king music!  Try it:)
0151003084|5.0|But you will not die of ennui if you open this book.  It illustrates the misfortunes of 26 children with names A-Z to a ghoulishly humorous rhyme.  The cover image of the umbrella wielding symbol of death and his doomed &quot;tinies&quot; is one of the most famous artwork out there; especially in the gothic world.  Inside are drawings of the children before or after their sudden deaths.  My favorite is &quot;H is for Hector done in by a thug&quot; with a drawing of an innocent schoolboy and two arms holding a long piece of cloth in the background.  No doubt this scene was inspired by the barbaric cult that practiced ritual strangulation known as the &quot;Thuggies.&quot;  The most gruesome drawing is &quot;K is for Kate who was struck with an axe&quot; the rest are more witty than grisly.  Like the title, this book is tiny in size as well but big on macabre humor!
B00005IC2H|5.0|This c.d. is definitely one of my favorites!  I love every track on here, but I can listen to Vidrar Vel Til Loftarasa over and over again (I can't believe nobody mentioned that song). Staralfur brings me to tears every time! This is great music for driving, sleeping, chilling out, f**king...I don't know why people can't get over the Hopelandic thing.  My favorite singer of all time is Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator soundtrack), and she made up her own language, too.  Words get in the way, sometimes.  I think it's cool to listen to music and decide what it says to you, instead of being spoon-fed lyrics.  Maybe it means nothing!  Who the hell cares! It's beautiful.  Check out ( ), as well.  I think I like it just as well as this one. They're both joyous and heart-breaking at the same time. Can't wait to listen to this under the influence of hallucinogens...
0792833201|5.0|A young suburban family's home is taken over by other-worldly visitors who in an act of absolute vengeance, kidnap the youngest daughter.<br /><br />The best of all screen ghost movies, &#34;Poltergeist&#34; delivers non-stop action & spectacular special effect that still manage to look good & spooky even after 20 plus years. The film is able to capture every childhood fear and use them effectively as tools to scare the pants off the poor children, Carole Anne and Robbie (Heather O'Rourke, Oliver Robins respectively) & the parents, Steven and Diane (Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams).<br /><br />There is the fear of water and in this case, a half finished, muddy swimming pool (or hole in the ground would be a better description) is used in 2 unsettling scenes. The first is when the worried parents, fearing that their child may have slept walked right into the muddy pool, frantically search for her in the dark, slimy waters and the final classic scene during the film's riveting climax which has poor Diane wearing nothing but her PJ's, falls into the muddied waters and is accompanied by a bunch of unwanted swimming companions. Then there is the fear of creepy clowns. This one is especially a bad one since many children and adults alike are already mistrusting of clowns and I guess you have this film (and Stephen King's &#34;IT&#34;) to thank for this. There is also that fear of that menacing tree (with arm like branches), in front of your bedroom window and that classic childhood fear of monsters in the closet, or underneath the bed. The writers really didn't leave anything out and the films classic tagline &#34;It knows what scares you&#34; is fitting.<br /><br />What I love about this film is the build-up. It all starts cute, with the angelic cherub Carole Anne, walking charmingly down the staircase almost in a trance-like state, and begins talking to the television set. The family soon begin experiencing some mild paranormal activity- glasses breaking, cutlery bending, furniture moving by themselves, the family dog begins to react to a presence in the bedroom etc, and the mother, Diane, at first, seems amused by these strange occurrences. Quicker than you can say boo, the activity turns sinister as a supernatural assault is unleashed and Carole Anne is sucked into a netherworld and the family has to turn to a team of parapsychologists and a psychic dwarf for help. Although the film is bit long, running approximately 114 minutes, and there is a lot of supernatural talk (much of it is interesting though, especially Tangina's speech during the last quarter of the film), &#34;Poltergeist&#34; is a film that is paced like a roller coaster ride. Every few minutes or so, something happens, and the climax is one of the most fantastic of any ghost movie.<br /><br />One of the film's key features is the Oscar-nominated special effects. I know many of today's younger audience who are only familiar with CGI may not realize how incredibly spectacular and intricate these effects really were. Yes, there are moments when the effects show its age. The face ripping scene for instance, although still gory and it remains one of the films memorable highlights, it is clearly apparent the head is fake (although the flesh and blood is incredibly lifelike).  Most of the time, the effects hold up well. The very memorable scene, where that floating phantasm, with its many tentacles, glides down the stairs, in my opinion, reigns supreme as the greatest ghost ever visualized on film, along with the spectacular almost spider-like monster that materializes at the films climax when Diane is trying to save her screaming children.<br /><br />Another of the films notable factors is the excellent ensemble cast. The performances are solid and the stand-out is JoBeth Williams. She is specially delightful and her performance was Oscar worthy as she does some really nice things here and delivers a strong dramatic performance.  The rest of the  cast delivers in spades - Nelson, Robins, Beatrice Straight, Zelda Rubinstein, the late Dominique (&#34;What's happening!&#34;) Dunne all do their best with the great material and no review would be complete without mentioning the late, angelic Heather O'Rourke. I just have to comment on her unblemished radiance and cuteness and her performance is noteworthy. Considering her age, she must have been no more than 5 years old when making this pictures, she is effective during her key scenes and it is a tragedy this talented little actress died at such a young age.<br /><br />&#34;Poltergeist&#34; was originally slapped with an &#34;R&#34; rating. The film's producers did not want this (maybe because this rating might hinder the film's success at the box office) and successfully fought against it claiming that the film had no sex, no nudity & no excess violence (to which there is a point since the violence on film is supernatural in its nature and aside from the ghosts plaguing the Freeling's home, no characters actually died in the film -  in real life, that is another story altogether) and I guess the censors backed down. At the time, &#34;PG-13&#34; did not exist so the film's rating was dropped to &#34;PG&#34;. Either way, &#34;Poltergeist&#34; remains a visually stunning horror film and combines grade-A special effects with a human element that most horror movies lack. It's an unnerving but remarkable horror tale of things that go bump in the night. Highly recommended.stein, the late Dominique (&#34;What's happening!&#34;) Dunne all do their best with the great material and no review would be complete without mentioning the late, angelic Heather O'Rourke.

B00005JLF5|4.0|Now we come to the underrated middle child of Trekdom.  Premiering in the midst of Next Generations's peak in popularity, Deep Space Nine was instantly overshadowed and ignored.  A shame, since this is beyond any doubt the finest Trek series, surpassing Captain Kirk &amp; Co., and presents some of the best science fiction in recent memory.  <br />Prior to DS9, Star Trek was basically about a bunch of interstellar social workers that traveled around solving everyone's problems.  Picard was a classy, cerebral philosopher, and Kirk was the sci-fi equivalent of Superman.  But from the very first scene of it's very first episode and the majestic but somber opening theme that follows, you know Deep Space Nine will be something different.  DS9 is set on a shabby space station (Deep Space 9) in the frontier of Federation territory.  It is administrated by a brooding, troubled man (Capt. Sisko) who would rather eat a live toad then be in charge of the station.  It is surrounded by warmongering, hostile alien races, one of which starts a devastating interstellar war later in DS9's run.  Clearly, this is a much darker show then what came before it.<br />The first season is pretty solid, though not as spectacular as what comes after it.  The two hour pilot episode &quot;Emissary&quot; does a good job of setting the characters and premise up, even though it's second half is basically 45 minutes of Sisko preaching to omnipotent life forms called &quot;Prophets&quot; about how great humanity is.<br />There are several very powerful episodes scattered throughout the season, all of which deal with the alien characters on the show (Kira in &quot;Progress&quot; and &quot;Battle Lines&quot;, Odo in &quot;Vortex&quot;, and Dax in... well, &quot;Dax&quot;).  The standouts though are obviously &quot;Duet&quot; and &quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot;, the two final episodes of the season.<br />&quot;Duet&quot; is a masterpiece, 'nuff said.  It consists of a gripping conflict between Kira and a Cardassian war criminal that slaughtered hundreds of her people (the Bajorans).  &quot;What you call genocide, I call a day's work.&quot; as the Cardassian so memorably puts it.  There are few twists involved in this, climaxing with an unprecedented and shocking ending that was unlike anything I had seen on TV before.  <br />&quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot; is a terrific and socially relevant episode about the separation of religion and state.  It also introduces Vedek/Kai Winn, an evil Bajoran priest played by Nurse Ratchet actress Louise Fletcher, who would become a major reoccurring villain as the show continued.  In this episode, she demands O'Brien's wife to stop teaching &quot;heresy&quot; (ie: science) in the station's school.  After she doesn't get her way, Whine--excuse me--Winn stirs the Bajoran population on the station into a near-rebellion against the lead characters, during which the school is bombed in an act of religious terrorism.  A fine episode in a pretty solid season which, despite a sluggish start (understandable, considering that this was the first year), still churned out a number of gems in the second half.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|WOW is the only way I can start..... Bad, Boring, Sleep Inducing, dribble.  Being a film nut who's taste runs to independent and foriegn films what a bummer to discover this total waste of time.  To show you how much I was looking forward to watching this film I not only purchased from Amazon I could not wait for it to arrive and bought a another at Barnes and Noble. So now I have two bookends of this boring film. The shocking part is that I am a fan of Bill Murray along with being an Italian and always pulling for a fellow Italian such as Sophia Coppola. There is nothing that I can say other than if you have a problem sleeping at night just flip this dvd in and I can assure you in no time at all you will be in dream land except for the occasional nightmare of this film playing in your head over and over and over and over. Really bad sorry Sofia.
B000127LW2|3.0|In 1993, Deep Space Nine's Nielsen ratings were sinking.  Many fans were not ready for a show that so radically different from their fluffy and comfortable TNG, others simply claimed DS9 was boring (what drugs they were obviously on, I do not know).  <br />Rather then start plaguing DS9 with ridiculous stunts to bring up those falling ratings, Paramount opted to develop yet another Star Trek series.  In hopes that DS9 would fade away as a forgotten \\"mistake\\", this third spin-off would return to the premise of a starship journeying where no one has gone before.  This spin-off's name was Star Trek: Voyager, and its premise would involve a new spin on the exploration bit:  In the pilot episode, the Voyager would be thrown all the way to the other side of the galaxy, isolated from home, and spend the next 70 years trying to get back.  It would also have a fragmented crew, as some of them would be Maquis terrorists who were sucked away in their rather miniscule ship with Voyager. <br />In my opinion, this was the perfect premise for a Star Trek show.  It didn't carry as much risk as DS9, and had far more potential for conflict and emotion than that show, let alone TNG and TOS.  Coupled with the best cast Star Trek had been privileged to at that point (though DS9's cast would later prove itself worthy of that title), Voyager was expected to carry the franchise to new levels of popularity.  Unfortunately, things did not turn out that way.<br />What fustrates me so much about this show is that all the great facets mentioned above where completely, utterly wasted.  Rather than have it's crew struggle to survive alone in a hostile climate without the comforts of those starbases the Enterprise liked to retreat to when it needed repairs or replenishing, and have it's captain face numerous mutinies by what could have been an increasingly fractured crew, everything was played out nice, happy, and safe.  The threats of Maquis rebellion were gone by episode 2, and the crew never had to deal with diminishing supplies at all.  By the end of it's first season, Voyager had become a remake of TNG, and not a very good one.  <br />Where TNG developed it's characters and made them interesting, VGR continuously ignored them in favor of silly pseudo-intellectual plots and/or extreme preachiness.  Only in the last few seasons were some (as in two) of the characters even somewhat developed, while the rest--namely Chakotay, Kim, Paris, and Tuvok went neglected.  <br />Worst of all is Captain Janeway, who while competently portrayed by actress Kate Mulgrew, was written horrendously.  In one episode she would be willing to murder a Starfleet officer because he violated Federation morals (S6's \\"Equinox Pt2\\"), in the next she would wipe out an entire timeline to get her crew home faster (\\"Endgame\\", the series finale.)  This is not good writing, this is inconsistant sloppiness which, if I were to take seriously, would mean that Janeway is a bipolar maniac whose promotion past the rank of Cadet casts doubt on the very sanity of those giving the promotion.<br />However, Voyager does have it's moments.  Some episodes, such as season 5's \\"Course: Oblivion!\\" and season 7's two-parter \\"Flesh and Blood\\" do show hints of brave storytelling, and [gasp!] force the characters to endure the consequences of their actions in previous episodes.  If only these types of stories had been there series norm, what a thrill ride the show would have been.  Sadly, this is not the case, and Voyager turned out to be the weakest and lowest rated Trek show.  Until its down right atrocious successor came along in 2001, that is.<br />As far as this specific season goes, it is by far VGR's strongest year.  Premise-abandonment aside, the first few episodes, namely \\"Caretaker\\", \\"Time and Again\\", & \\"The Phage\\" are remarkably strong as far as first-few-episodes go.  The season rapidly nosedives into dullness after them, but that is more excusable here as this was the freshman year.  Also, the less major characters had not yet been regressed into two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, as happened later on.  If your are going to own any season of Voyager, Season 1, for all its flaws, is probably the one.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This CD is the best CD i own. I love these guys. When i first heard One Armed Scissor i coudldn't get it out of my head. I had to have this CD. So I traded my friend a Disturbed Cd for it!!! Best thing i ever did. This Cd BLEW ME AWAY!!<br />1. Arc Arsenal----This song is one of my favorites, nice an heavy lots of screaming<br />2. Pattern Against User---Alittle toned down From Arc Arsenal but still a good tune<br />3. One Armed Scissor---BEST SONG EVER WRITTEN!! Man this song is like no other you've ever heard, awesome vocals, drums, guitars, and bass<br />4. Sleep walk Capsules--A slight change of pace from hearing one armed scissor before it but still has that intensity<br />5. Invalid Litter Dept.--Awesome song, kinda slowed down but just has that outter space sound to it, almost Mars Volta Sounding<br />6. Mannequin Republic--A faster paced song, a nice constant driving tune, nice vocals<br />7. Enfilade--This is another favorite song, another song that sounds almost like the Mars Volta. The whole song is just sick, one of the best<br />8. Rolodex Propaganda--Awesome song, music is great <br />9. Quarantined--Man i can't express how much i love this song, i might go as far as to say the best on the whole album. You have to, HAVE TO hear this song!! Its Intense, really sucks me in<br />10. Cosmonaut---FAST song, this is like Arc Arsenal on steroids really good<br />11. Non-Zero Possibility--A great ending song, you get that adrenaline rush from cosmonaut then this song lets you down gently.<br />So all in all, this is a great cd to own you will not be dissapointed go pick it up right now, along with The Mars Volta and the rest of ATDI's albums all great.
0385504209|5.0|This is a mystery full of great mystique and surprise. I loved the cliff hanger chapter endings and couldn't stop turning the pages to unravel the code. I shall reserve further commentary as there are spoilers potholes abound when discussing The DaVinci Code. I recommend this one enthusiastically!<br />Geena Brighton, columnist for Sherrington
B00005JKCH|5.0|Kudos to Sam Raimi and Co. for delivering on the promise of 18 years of copyright wars!!After nearly two decades in litigous hell, &quot;Spider-man&quot; is a full throttle, devoted and faithful adaptation of the greatest comic book hero ever. Tobey Maguire shines as Peter Parker/Spiderman, and Willem Dafoe lends a deft bit of psychosis and humanity to the role of the Green Goblin. Ditto Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Rosemary Harris as Aunt  May. And special nods to to Cliff Robertson as the emphatic and sympathetic Uncle Ben. Yes, the Goblin's frozen gargoyle mask detracts from the insidious nature of the character, but other than that, this film never steps wrong. People have complained about the CGI effects. Phooey!!! Not since Superman caught the helicopter in one hand and Lois Lane in the other have I been so captivated and exhilerated by the screen presence of a superhero!!! In fact, this is hands down the best comic adaptation since the original &quot;Superman.&quot; If you like Spidey, then prepare to be dazzled. This film gives me hope, because it effectively demonstrates that there are filmmakers out there who still can embody their characters with a sense of wonder and awe. That's the strength of this movie- it regards its titular character with a sense of wonder, something sorely lacking in, say, the depressing &quot;Batman&quot; franchise. If this is the launch, then I cannot wait until the sequels! Go Spiderman! It's good to have a hero to cheer for again!!! This movie is nothing short of spectacular!!!!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|The first time I heard Jet was when they performed live on Saturday Night Live.  I couldn't stop thinking about them afterwards!  They are an absolutley amazing band!  The best thing is that they are a real band!!!  Not like a lot of these wannabe groups today.  Jet is real!  The day after hearing them on SNL I ran out to get the CD!  The CD is great!  Not a single song on it that I don't love.  Jet is going to be a huge group!  AMAZING is all i can say!  Everyone should get it!

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost In Translation is probably one of my favorite movies ever, the cinematography captured Japan so beautifully. I wouldn't recommend this movie for bloated Americans who are engrossed by the latest Vin Diesel or Ben Affleck movie, please save your time because chances are you won't understand anything about this movie. Although the plot revolves around two Americans who are jetlagged in Tokyo, there is so much more going on with their lives and their brief relationship. This movie deserves every acclaim that it has received.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|My bemused friends. This is the 453rd review of this album and of the previous 452 reviews none are truly helpful. Even my own previous review entitled \\"Who needs Drugs?\\" which languishes somewhere near the middle of the pack, is not going to be helpful under this confused state of affairs. <br />Therfore, after reading numerous of these reviews, I am going to analyze their findings and make recommendations accordingly. <br />The reason for this plethora of wildly varying opinions of Train of Thought, is because with this CD, Dream Theater is entering a new phase on their musical evolution. They have prudently and rightly ascertained that to keep recording, what is basically the same material, is effectively a death sentence.<br />So, What do we have here? Well it looks like about 20 % of the reviewers (one and two stars) who professed to be die hard fans were shocked by the new Dream Theater and subsequently hated TOT. Obviously if you as a potential buyer are dogmatic and are looking for the same old (but still very good) sound, you shouldn't buy TOT.<br />The next group we have (Three stars) is the ones who don't know what to make of TOT. They don't seem to rushing to judgement (though they've written reviews) and are somewhat ambivilent. About 15% of our reviewers felt this way and I was one of these people at first but after multiple listens became a fan. That's right, I think TOT takes multiple listens to appreciate but let's face it isn't DT worth multiple listens. What else are we going to listen to, Beyonce? So if you are this kind of person, you should go ahead and buy TOT. Worse case, it won't grow on you and you end up with a mediocre album but the upside is worth it. <br />Next (four stars) at about 25% is the group that appreciates TOT and DT's latest endeavor and their need to experiment and grow and voice opinions that although TOT is not DT's best or second best or even third best album it is a very good album in it's own right. Again if I may be redundant, what are your options, Janet Jackson? OOPS! <br />Lastly of course we have the true die hard DT fans (five stars), about 40%, who think TOT is great, one of their best and can't for the life of them, understand how anyone could not love this album and say so in their reviews. I kinda side with them but I can understand where the other groups are coming from. I guess I'm in between groups three and four at about 4 1/2 stars.<br />SUMMARY:<br />If you like the old Dream Theater just fine, thank you, and do not wish to experiment on a newer and slightly heavier DT - PASS<br />If you are not as rigid but think you may like the old DT better - IT'S YOR CALL, it's still Dream Theater!<br />If you are flexible and open to new stuff, especially from DT - ABSOLUTELY!<br />If you are an extreme, die hard Dream Theater fan. You probably have it already. <br />MY BOTTOM LINE: <br />Dream Theater is the most visable, most revered and best known of all PROG ROCK/METAL bands. By being the number one progressive band in the world they have been annointed to carry the torch through the dark passages of mundane popular music. Though they are not my personal favorite Progressive band, I do love them and feel for them as they carry a heavy burden. Long Live Dream Theater. You may not like the alternative.
B00004Z459|5.0|My first LP experience (besides In the End on the radio) was when I bought Meteora after I heard them on The Matrix Reloaded soundtrack. I thoroughly listened to that album, and after a few weeks decided to buy its predecessor. I must admit, I didn't like Hybrid Theory all that much the first few listens. It hardly sounded like Meteora at all, bearing a rougher, more aggresive sound. After a few listens, however, I learned the lyrics and began to fully appreciate Hybrid Theory's nuances. Now, after collecting every album released including b-sides and seeing them in concert, I enjoy Meteora and Hybrid Theory  equally, though the styles may be different. This certainly isn't pseudo-metal, pseudo-rap crap like Limp Bizkit puts out. Look past the generalization of Nu Metal and see the art which lies there.
B000088E6D|5.0|Disappointed to see that this cd/artist didn't get the nod for a Grammy. This should have been recognized!<br />This cd and Norah's are easily the best releases in years.
B00005JMFO|2.0|Although it is at times witty and delightfully British, it is really not a very good movie. So there is this great cast, these wonderful actors (Emma Thompson, Hugh Grqant, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman for christ's sake) employed in the most desolate, incomplete, asinine roles of their careers.  There is little to no character development and few storylines reach any sort of comprehensible conclusion.  Bad, so horribly bad.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is an amazing achievement for the director Sofia Coppola and the actors Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. The film plays like one long beautiful dream of friendship and shared experiences in an alternate universe. <br />The film's plot is simple. Two Americans-a mid-50's, washed up actor played by Bill Murrray and a young, married Yale graduate played by Johansson-find themselves lost in Tokyo for a week. They're not really lost of course: Murray is there to shoot a TV commercial and Johansson to accompany her hip photographer husband. But being set adrift in the bright lights of Tokyo makes each realize how lost they are in their own lives. Murray's character is going through a classic mid-life crisis while Johansson's character is undergoing a more unusual beginning of life crisis. <br />They connect in the hotel bar after seeing each other at various venues. Slowly and subtly a lovely, amazing friendship develops. They are at the same stage of their lives emotionally if not chronologically. And that's the beauty of the movie: how at a disparate moment of time, two souls can connect on an emotional and not a physical level.<br />The frenzy of Tokyo day and night life provides a powerful counterpoint to the slowly unfolding friendship. Coppola has an amazing eye for the scenes and sights that tell a story--she gives you just enough of the neon lights and just enough of the green zen gardens to make you feel as if you are in Tokyo.<br />I would recommend this movie to those individuals who gravitate towards intelligent, art house films. Yes Bill Murray does his deadpan schtick here: but it reveals the darker undertones that perhaps were always there. <br />The DVD featurettes are good (you want more), particularly a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola. The deleted scenes include more from Anna Faris, who turns in an outstanding supporting performance as a young and ditzy actress turned loose in Tokyo, whose experience could not be more dissimilar to Murray and Johansson's. <br />I consider this movie one of the best that I have seen over the past few years--and I see a lot of movies!
B00000634J|3.0|After listening to this CD, I thought that I would be amazed.   Yes there are some songs like Woman, Nobody Told Me, Happy XMas, Instant Karma, Working Class Hero, and Imagine that are absolute masterpieces.  But, as for the rest of the CD, nothing but filler songs and Imagine rip offs.    Cold Turkey is a great song, but only live in my opinion.  The studio doesn't do it justice.    There are some other songs that are OK.   I think that John had exhausted almost all of his creativity in his Beatles days.   Macca definately had a lot of better quality songs as a solo artist than John.  John was the more creative Beatles in the early days, but Macca started to become even with him, which led to some great songs from both of them.  This is still a good CD, but not as great as one would expect.  Maybe if some songs were remastered that would have enhanced some.
B000002G0P|5.0|This is the most overlooked band ever! It was a shame to see the music scene change because this CD is a work of art! Nuno is a genius! He and Gary Cherone can sing together so well! I had the cassette but wanted the CD! I bought it and was dissapointed to find there was&quot; Don't Leave Me Alone&quot; missing! I am so glad I kept the cassette! The whole thing tells a story and shows the most amazing talented band!It is a shame this is now out of print. I was so excited when VH1 did the special on Bands Reunited! I really wish they would have gotten back together! Anyway this is a must have! All I can say is get it! You won't regret it! I really wish they were still around!
B00005JMCN|2.0|This movie was nominated for best picture? <br />  The worst choice ever. Even when they nominate terrible movies (like English Patient), they are at least oscar material. <BR>  But nominate such a run-of-the-mill, unoriginal, and only mildely entertaining movie?<br />  The movie was ok, Jeff Bridges was very good. Maguire was like he usualy is, and Chris Cooper is nothing amazing. I can't believe Williams H. Macy was even in the running in the globes for such a jokey role, which requires no actign at all. And he wasn't even nominated for The cooler, his best performance ever.<br />  And why the hell is Steven Soderberg doing commentary on this movie?
B00004RITP|5.0|Rattle had recorded this symphony over 20 yrs ago with the City of Birmingham Symphony orchestra and produced a classic recording. Now older, more experienced and with the stately BPO he has surpassed his earlier masterpiece. The electricity of the first performance may be less but the sound, playing of the orchestra and overall tour de force makes this version oen to sell your shirt for. A neglected symphony due to the controversy over which completed version is best but Rattle brings it forward and under the BPO it is a true masterpiece.
B00003CX9E|5.0|the film is a stunning masterpiece.  it is not over the top like films of today, but expect to be drawn in and to fall in love with the film.  the images are beautiful, and black and white is a beautiful and artistic medium.  the acting is excellent, and the plot is one of Hollywood's best.
B0000640VO|5.0|I delight in films about vulnerable people finding redemption, and this is one such film. Amelie is a fragile creature, a young woman afraid of the world, too wounded by life to love and be loved, who one day serendipitously stumbles upon a child's box of toys and trinkets that will set in motion the events that promise her salvation. She begins finding ways to help people, but only ever from a distance. When she is granted the opportunity to open herself to life and love, however, will she run away, or will she take the plunge?<br />Here we have a fascinating tale that celebrates the giftedness, uniqueness and specialness of every person and every moment. In an extraordinarily magical way, director Jeunet causes us to weep and laugh at the ironies of life and the blessedness of truly living it. Cinematically, this is inventive and visually entrancing. Audrey Tatou is charming as the character at the centre of Jeunet's surreal yet totally believable world.
0898705525|4.0|Let me keep this short for the person who just wants a quick and dirty view. I realize that most readers loved this book and will defend it to the end, but to be fair the book can be hard to follow at times, i.e., the book requires a background knowledge of the late 20th century that most causual readers don't have and can be frustratingly inconsistent in terms of clarity. <br />The book is witty and provocative, but if you're looking for something to use to help your agnostic neighbor who's hooked on phonetics and the X-box, this book will be a big snore. <br />For those of us who want an apologetics change-up, it's a good read.
B0000CGV00|5.0|This is going to to become a historic CD. Ms. Grimaud's, and also Mr. Salonen's first recording on DG.<br />And what a joy this is. Ms. Grimaud's playing is so sparkling, and Salonen's conducting with the SRSO is so fresh and youthful through and through. Beethoven in a totally new light. The Corigliano and the Paert are wonderful bonusses in a program leading from the romantic to the modern, and all artists excel at each one of these pieces. Just listen to the Credo: Seldomly have I heard more power, more dedication, but also more finesse up to the sublime.<br />By all means, get this CD! I would have given ten stars.
0393037010|5.0|Let me add to the online discussion that Master and Commander is a fine standalone book.  I have not read the next 19 in the series, and may not.  Regardless, I feel I have invested well, as O'Brian paints a vivid, colorful portrait of sailboat battling in the Napoleonic era.  I picked up an original 1969 copy of the book from the local library, and the dusty old jacket was a constant reminder of just how timeless this story is.<br />Yes, it takes a bit of work and a few chapters to delve into the terminology of the early nineteenth century, but that's not too hard.  And yes, there are entire stretches throughout the novel that are utterly boring...much like being stuck in the shipyard while repairs are underway, or becalmed on a glassy sea.<br />The reader happily musters on though to arrive at a new battle, to learn a bit more about the complex Jack Aubrey or intellectual Doctor Maturin.  Along with the overwhelming technical sailing jargon, O'Brian throws in some pretty wry humor: His observations of the mating Praying Mantis parallels the mating experiences of Commander Aubrey.  For as skilled and adept Lucky Jack Aubrey is at sea, he is mere mortal (and indeed a first rate klutz) ashore.  Just the opposite of his trusty sidekick Maturin, who is a seafaring neophyte, and knows his way around the spars even less well than we the readers do.<br />If nothing else, this tale will have you yearning for a sunny Mediterranean cruise.
0783240287|4.0|I was never a big fan of Donny Osmond.  But after seeing this DVD, it has changed my opinion of him.  I can't imagine a role more perfectly suited for him.  Nor can I imagine anyone else who could've done the role as well!  Apart from the excellent songs, there were more than a couple of scenes which would NOT be appropriate for kids younger than teens.  So enjoy the movie, but use your judgment in deciding to share it with your younger kids.  Without the risque scenes, it would've been a 5-star.
0385504209|5.0|This is the book to which I set the standard for all of my reading, it is the book to beat. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and we've had a great time passing our recommendations along and discussing it with friends.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Where to begin... I have been a huge Neil fan for many a year and learned to play guitar playing his early stuff. Many years later AT LSUI met a friend who had a copy of On The Beach on LP and he turned me on to it. I prized the cassette that I had of a nearly perfect recording. I can't tell you how many late nights my friend would decide we had consumed enough and were wiped out enough to play the tape. Man it is the best music I have put on at 4AM PERIOD! I became a tradition and the tape became part of our friendship. Friends would say they were huge fans of Neil, and we would give each other a knowing look and ask, \\"Like On The Beach?\\" They would look puzzled and then we would explain the story of Neil's `missing 6 pack\\". All I can say is &quot;Thanks Neil...about time!&quot; It is one of his top 3 works. BUY IT!
B0001906O0|4.0|Coming from a Cure fan, but not a true believer type, I expected a lot out of a cd package this expensive.  What I wanted was new material (to me, or at least not on their albums), not a lot of remix re-hashes of interest only to collectors.  There's some filler here (do we really need two versions of Purple Haze and Hello I Love You?), but for the most part the package is chock full of good stuff that stands on its own, about two full cd's worth.  That's maybe a cd less than the asking price, and given that this is bonus material, I would expect a discount, especially in relation to the very reasonable price put on the excellent &quot;Trilogy&quot; DVD.  My other complaint is that the darn thing doesn't fit on my cd shelf.<br />I've always lusted after a copy of some of these songs, and I'd prefer not to rip off one of my favorite bands by pursuing them on usenet or p2p.  So here they are, all those songs I've wanted like &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Twilight Garden&quot;.  Good, I'm glad to finally have them.  I just wish I had another $20 in my pocket, but considering how little &quot;Trilogy&quot; cost me, maybe this is proper payback.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation is a wonderful movie. It is a well put together, beautiful piece of art worthy of the praise it has received. It is also a ringing indictment of the world in which we find ourselves.<br />Simply put--humanity, both collectively and as individuals, has a void which it is incapable of filling. We strive after multitudes of things to fill this gap--to block out, however temporarily the foreboding sense that there must be more to life. These things, be they products, people, jobs, or crusades for one issue or another, always fail to put an end to the void--to give us meaning.<br />As time passes whole cultures are becoming frenetic in the energy they expend to try and narcoticize themselves to this fact of human reality. Things speed up. People disconnect from each other and abandon true community. We are satiated with the latest consumer goods and electronic gadgets.<br />Lost in Translation is the story of two people struggling with the holes in their lives, the inhumanity of the cultures in which they live, and the wounds that they bear as a result.<br />Charlotte and Bob (played brilliantly by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray respectively) are two lost souls who find each other while being doubly \\"lost\\" in a foreign land. This at first sounds like the plot for a standard romantic comedy (especially with Murray involved), yet Lost in Translation, in its fiercely honest portrayal of the lonely brokenness of the human condition, transcends its genre.<br />Though darkly comic in parts, Lost in Translation hits the nail on the head in dealing with humanity's proclivity for compromising everything to try and fill our emptiness (which only leaves us more empty). There are a thousand clich&eacute;d questions that this movie begs one to ask; not least of which is: `whether it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?' (Not that anyone `loses' here...but that brings up another whole series of questions.)<br />But what strikes me as pertinent here is that neither Charlotte nor Bob was happy before their relationship begins bringing up all these questions in the viewer's mind. Bob's marriage sucks. So does Charlotte's. However, one senses that even before this these characters were looking for greater meaning. Bob has fruitlessly sought fulfillment from his work. Charlotte studied philosophy and tried writing (which left her just as empty as Bob).<br />Could it be that while we pity the plight of poor Charlotte and Bob that we are missing a wake-up call (or perhaps in this case wake-up curtains) of our own? The catalyst for Bob and Charlotte's misery in Lost in Translation is that they are together in a place they both see as foreign, over-stimulated and in many ways incomprehensible.<br />Yet being lost and unhappy in a foreign land is nothing exceptional compared to how most of us live our daily lives. Bob and Charlotte could run off and live in New York with each other-though nothing would change. We, like Charlotte and Bob, know we are disconnected. We know we are lost. On top of it all, we are caught up in the imagination and lifestyle of lands created by people drowning in their own terrible voids of doubt and meaninglessness-people who never had the strength to swim.<br />The greatest gift of Lost in Translation is that it shows `reality' for what it really is: a monumental lack of imagination and a false construct overlaying the possibility of a true life just waiting to be found.<br />The truth of this movie, though perhaps only implied, is this:<br />Not many of us are wise. Not many of us are strong. Yet when we grow still, when our struggles cease, there is a weakness stronger than our strength, foolishness wiser than our years. In the silence it lifts us up.<br />I recommend this movie.ertinent here is that neither Charlotte nor Bob was happy before their relationship begins bringing up all these questions in the viewer's mind.

B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta's De-loused in The Comatorium is a masterpiece. Flows together perfectly. Each song has a different type of piece, but all supporting the same story about a guy who goes into a coma and dies. The lyrics of Cedric Bixler are amazing. I was amazed when I turned on the first track and how perfectly it flowed into track two, and track two flowed into track three and so on and so forth. You can expect really good starts and good finishes from &quot;Inertiatic ESP&quot;, &quot;Roulette Dares&quot;, &quot;Eriatarka&quot;, <BR>&quot;This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed&quot;, and &quot;Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt.&quot; This is a worth buy cd, and classic to own for anybody who likes At The Drive-In and Tool. You'll love The Mars Volta!!
B00013PHGS|4.0|This CD is fantastic.  Dont worry about the copy protection.  You can still rip these songs to another CD or your hD or whatever you want.  It doesn't matter at all.  Do a search on google for John Halderman Princeton.  He wrote an interesting article about holding down the shift key when loading the CD. Apparently there is a bug in the software that allows you to sidestep the protection by doing this.<br />Rock on all!
B00009V7T2|5.0|In more detail, I'll describe the cd. As you will see in this review, there are a lot of great starts and great finishes.<br />1. Son Et Lumiere - This is the song that is the whole intro to the cd. Great lyrics and basically starts of the story about the guy in the coma. 9/10<BR>2. Inertiatic ESP - Great song, although you won't expect a really great chorus becuz all he says is &quot;Now I'm Lost&quot;, though a great second song 8/10<BR>3. Roulette Dares - Excellent song! The lyrics truly flow well with the song. The only problem is that it doesn't include him saying &quot;This is the roulette dares...&quot; like he says in one of the versions I have got but otherwise a good song. 10/10<BR>4. Tira Me A Las Arenas - I think there is really no point putting this song on a cd, unless it were the ending of Roulette Dares. 2/10<BR>5. Drunkship Of Lanterns - I have no words to explain about this song becuz it is so good. 9/10<BR>6. Eriatarka - Rockers who would like Radiohead, Tool, and ATDI together would love this song, becuz it doesn't have too much electronics on it. It lies there on the cd as a masterpiece.10/10<BR>7. Cicatriz ESP - I would say this is probably the worst song on the cd. The idea of stopping in the middle with ambient music for 2 minutes is just a stupid idea. Totally not a good use for a cd. 1/10<BR>8. This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed - Great song, and has a good chorus to go along with it. The only problem is that I find it too short, but whatever. 9/10<BR>9. Televators - Hmmm...it's okay. 4/10<BR>10. Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt - There is no great album without a success of a great outtro to the cd. This song sets an example of how powerful the cd can be. Perfect lyrics, and perfect beginnings and endings. I think it deserves to be another one of the best songs on the cd. 10/10<br />Well, they may not be a popular band, but maybe being post-rock is probably the best way to go. Still great. I hope their future cds are absoloutley amazing as well.
0425188809|5.0|I generally dont write book reviews, i leave that for the 'critics' but this book was just too good for words. I dont want to raise your expectations, but I would call it Koontz's best book ever. (true i havent red all, but so far the best!)<br />There are times when u are soo much into the story that u must absolutely finish the chapter before you set it aside..<br />Another thing I like about the book is that when Koontz is deep within in a ploy or scene in the book, he wont leave u hanging/wondering and switch the scene. <br />Lovely story, the suspence is mindboggling.. having said that, the ending was a little too quick.. i reached the last 10 pages, and i was still wondering what would happen of the characters...<br />As professional critics would put it... 'two thumbs up' :)
B0000YWKHC|5.0|This movie is brilliant. There is no other word to describe &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;, the somber journey of two lonely people who become friends in the neon lights of Tokyo while they kill time until they can return home to the US. Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this gem, and she has created a quiet, sublime film that gets the point across not through endless chatter, but poignant dialogue that only comes out when it needs to. There is much in her style that comes from her famous father, but she makes it into her own, and she is unbelievably good at it. This is her second film, and it is even better than &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, which was also an exceptional film. She will be a force to be reckoned with on the film scene for years to come, as she has an undeniable talent. <br />Much has to be said about the acting in this movie, because the performances from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen are top-notch. Murray was nominated for an Oscar for this performance, and it is much deserving, because it is the best of his long career. The fact that Johanssen was not nominated is a travesty, but she is only 18 and has a long, promising career in front of her. Both of them work so well together, taking advantage of the simply written script and making the most out of every delicious line and nuance that Coppola has put into her work. The third major character in this movie has to be the city of Tokyo itself, and the director captures it and its strangeness perfectly. <br />I reccommend this movie to everybody, and I look forward to seeing more from Coppola, as she deserves all the accolades that she is receiving for this movie.
B000088E6D|5.0|I swear this guy must be Frank Sinatra's reincarnated twin or something. He's got all that Frank had with a slight modern edge. His voice is a smooth as butter &amp; the songs are catchy. My only advice: BUY THIS CD!
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book. It is clearly and absolutely one of the best books I've ever read. MR Martel's style is refreshing and miraculously descriptive and clear. I felt like I was there with Pi and Richard Parker the whole time. The introduction to the story is absolutely essential to its development. The wonderful information given about animals and their habits was great. I can't say enough. Life of Pi is a book I will read again and I never re-read a book. I was sorry when it ended. I think it's most impressive quality is that MR Martel allows the animals to be animals and remain animals. He does not make them into humans even though we want RP to become human...we want him to befriend Pi and become his friend for life he remains a Bengal Tiger. He remains true to his own nature until the end. Don't miss this opportunity for a wonderful story.
B00005JKED|5.0|One of the very best cop movies out there! Great entertainment!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If you had ever listened to any of Britney Spears' pre-fame or Mickey Mouse Club performances, you would have known all along that the girl has real talent. The problem with many of the performances on her first, more mainstream albums is that she had too much style and not enough substance, although the songs themselves were great, and that's why I bought those albums. On &quot;In The Zone,&quot; however, Britney strips away much of the over-styling, and one can see that she is well on her way to finding her musical soul. Her style is now soft, sensual, and pretty. Britney exhibits real emotion on &quot;In The Zone,&quot; especially on &quot;Everytime,&quot; which actually made me get a little teary(seriously!) when I listened to it. In fact, (American Idol fans, forgive me for saying this) Britney Spears' &quot;In The Zone&quot; exhibits more soul than Kelly Clarkson's &quot;Thankful,&quot; which I refuse to buy because the singing sounds completely formulaic to me - ironically, talent-competition-winner Clarkson apparently has lots of skill, but little genuine talent.<br />  But getting back on topic, however, the sounds of &quot;In The Zone&quot; are different enough from usual pop that when I first listened to it, I thought, &quot;What is this strange, new stuff?&quot; However, when I listened to it a few more times, the album completely grew on me. I love it - I have come to embrace the sounds of &quot;In The Zone&quot; as diverse, unique and fresh.<br />  &quot;Toxic&quot; is by far the album's best track. If you can listen to it without wanting to get up and jump and dance around to this highly infectious beat, I'm sorry, but something's wrong with you. &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; is also upbeat and fun. &quot;Me Against The Music,&quot; &quot;Early Mornin'&quot; and &quot;Outrageous&quot; are songs that often get stuck in my head. I also particularly like &quot;Showdown,&quot; &quot;Breathe On Me,&quot; and &quot;Touch Of My Hand.&quot; Actually, all the songs are pretty good. The only one I don't really care for and sometimes skip is &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom.&quot; The Ying Yang Twins' cavorting just kind of ruins that song for me.<br />  All in all, this might be my favorite Britney Spears album yet and I hope she does even more and better writing and singing on her next album. Good luck, Brit... don't stop now.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Why did it take me so long to write a review? I bought this album the day it came out and was so worried about what I would hear. Sophomore efforts from incredible debuts kind of work like movie sequels- they tend to not be as good. Linkin Park revive their sound, and mold it like true art. And at first I didn't like it at all. But extended listening has this rivaling &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. It grows on you.<br />1. FOWARD (-) No score, so song.<BR>2. DONT STAY (A) Wakes us up into what we know, and what we like. A very strong track.<BR>3. SOMEWHERE I BELONG (B+) Honestly, the reason I was worried about this CD was because of this song. The bridge is awesome, though.<BR>4. LYING FROM YOU (B) Back to business with this one. But somehow I'm still feeling alienated...<BR>5. HIT THE FLOOR (A) This is very fresh! agressive, resistant- this song fights you! <BR>6. EASIER TO RUN (A) Soaring with vocals, this is Linkin Park's rock ballad.<BR>7. FAINT (A-) Love flowing to this, Linkin Park's answer to pop anthems.<BR>8. FIGURE.09 (A-) At this point in the CD we are hearing a blend of what we've heard, and never heard before. This is good.<BR>9. BREAKING THE HABIT (B+) What is this?! It's super funky?! It's mellow?! It works!<BR>10. FROM THE INSIDE (A-) I'm feeling alienated from this disc. I can't tell this one from the three before it. Yay for screaming bridges!<BR>11. NOBODY'S LISTENING (A) Straight rap. Hated it at first. But I still couldn't get those &quot;eastern&quot; flutes out of my head. Now a fave, and good for break-dancing battles.<BR>12. SESSION (C) Yes, Mr Hahn is talented- No, we don't care.<BR>13. NUMB (A+) Redeams the whole album. One of the best songs I've ever heard. Makes me cry- almost.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I have come to terms with people who have not liked this movie but I am still baffled by their beligerent and insistant negative rantings! If you didn't like the movie, why'd you see it in the theater enough times to memorize lines?! LoL<br />I think that this movie was an excellent way to end the trilogy.  Definately unexpected, and on par with the story telling the Wakowski's have done in the other movies. If you find surrealism in art and literature (or in this case movies) to be lacking in your taste, this movie is not for you - not all questions are answered, and you are left to make your own deductions.  As everyone who worked the project stated in interviews \\"You will get out of this [Matrix Revolutions and the trilogy] exactly what you put into it.\\"<br />With the combination of philosophy orriginating from the Tao Teh Ching, and works from philosophers like Rene Descartes, the fusion of sociology from those of the likes of Jean Baudrillard and Kevin Kelly, with a twist of cyber/goth underground culture and fads make this a deeply eclectic, mind bending, and visually stimulating work.<br />There is a lot going on underneith the surface of just the movie with symbolisms, and dual meanings. Everything from the Merovingian Kings of France, to our current political, economical, and fear driven control systems.<br />NOTE: This last movie is really not a movie in and of itself, it is a final chapter! Watching it alone would be like reading the last 5 or 10 chapters of a really good large novel. This is only the conclusion of the story. You must have the first two movies with this one!
B0000CFW87|5.0|His voice is unforgettable.  You would never guess that Josh is as young as he is by listening.  He has stepped out of his usual genre several times on this second studio album with breathtaking results.  The classically oriented pieces are flawless.  I can only imagine what the future will hold with a voice like this.<br />If you can find the longer version of this CD, it is worth the extra money.  It includes a short behind-the-scenes DVD, and two songs not on the other version.  The final song, Mi Morena, written by Martin Page is exquisite.
0679731725|5.0|Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day was an excellent, but it is definitely not that everyone would enjoy.  Ishiguro takes the reader into the life of a 1950's old-fashioned English butler.  It is told in first person perspective by the butler Stevens, and the reader gets a full view of what is going on in the man's head.  The psychology of Stevens is astounding, and one can really feel for the character.  The book starts out relatively slow, but it picks up as the reader progresses.  While some people were probably checking there pulse, I felt as though Ishiguro did place much suspense and anxiousness in a very subtle way.  Everything about the book is subtle.  If a reader likes action, then this book is definitely not the right one.  On the other hand, if a reader likes astounding character development, interesting WWII political intrigue, and a hint of romance, this is the right book.  The reader finds oneself becoming sympathetic for Stevens, along with being annoyed with him and his stoicism.  The book is definitely a satisfying read, but it definitely takes patience, so don't start it if you need excitement right from the beginning.  This book won the Booker Prize for a reason, and anyone who makes it to the end won't regret it.
0385504209|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.<br />It was a well written book and kept me interested through out the entire book.<br />In fact, I have read the rest of Dan Brown's other books and enjoyed them as well.
B0000399WI|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie, adapted from Stephen King's short novel \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" can be summarized easily.  It tells the story of quiet banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been unjustly sent to Shawshank Prison to serve a double life sentence.  In prison, he forms a strong friendship with long-time inmate Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (played exquisitely by Morgan Freeman) who, though he doesn't realize it, helps Andy escape after 19 years in prison.  Also, help for this escape is provided by Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, Rachel Welch, and geology!!<br /><br />But there is more to this movie--much more.  Even a wrongful imprisionment, a corrupt warden and a ruthless prison guard captain (played superbly by Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown respectively), and enemies within the prison (such as Bogs and his \\"sisters\\") cannot get the best of Andy.  Why?  His hope never dies.  This is the art of this movie: it perfectly paints a picture of a man who will not give up the only thing that can't be taken away from him--hope.<br /><br />This is also a magical movie since you are completely enveloped in Shawshank from the very first movie shot.  You experience a prison life composed of routine, after routine, after routine.  This is one reason the movie is relatively long: to get the viewer involved in this routine.  Also, the long length of this movie gets across the passage of time which is crucial to this story about patience, the squeaky wheels of justice, and the growth of a long-term friendship.<br /><br />All actors in their supporting roles do a fantastic job and some of these roles have been mentioned above.  Also, look for James Whitmore's heart-wrenching portrayal of Brooks, a very long-term inmate.<br /><br />Something else that should be mentioned is Freeman's narration as Red.  His voice when he is narrating seems to add to the movie.  In fact, I can't imagine the movie without his narration!<br /><br />Here's other things that you'll find in this movie: contrasts, opposites, unpredictability, humor, persistence, justice and redemption, renewal, and the importance of freedom.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, there is a double surprise ending.  These endings answer two questions: (1) How did Andy escape? (2) How does Red benefit from Andy's escape?<br /><br />Since this is an all-male prison movie, there is some violence and foul language.  But these are not gratuitous and add realism to the movie.<br /><br />This movie has many memorable lines.  My two favorites are as follows: (1) \\"Get busy living or get busy dying\\" (2) \\"Hope is a good thing--maybe the best of things.\\"<br /><br />This is one of the few movies where subsequent viewings actually enhances its impact.  Why is this?  Because there are so many wonderful things on-screen that are presented to the viewer.<br /><br />The only minor complaint I have with the movie is that it sometimes can be unrealistic.  But this can be forgiven since the story is so engrossing.<br /><br />In conclusion, as mentioned Andy escapes Shawshank prison.  The viewer, however, will find the she/he cannot escape watching this powerful movie!!<br /><br />(1994; 2 hr, 20 min; widescreen)<br /><br />+++++n this movie: contrasts, opposites, unpredictability, humor, persistence, justice and redemption, renewal, and the importance of freedom.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, there is a double surprise ending.

0316666343|3.0|'The Lovely Bones' by Alice Sebold is a rather unusual book.  It is narrated by the ghostly (or perhaps better said, 'angelic') spirit of a murdered teenaged girl.  She tells the story of her murder (..not too gruesome) and how it had affected the lives of her family and friends.  This might sound fine but it's not, or at least not entirely.<br />The book starts off somewhat moody and dark, as we understand how the narrator was killed.  Very reminiscent of 'Being Dead' by Jim Crace (... a rather good book).  But then the book switches gears and becomes more of a domestic drama (her family breaks up, her sister falls in love, etc).  And it eventually evolves into a spiritual &quot;touchy feely&quot; mess, much like the movie 'Ghost' (okay, it wasn't a bad movie).  So after starting out rather well 'The Lovely Bones' goes downhill.  The ending was very anti-climatic.<br />Bottom line: a book that should have very good turns out to be unexceptional.  Not recommended.
B000002H2H|4.0|Even though Metallica didn't truly break out and become mainstream until 1991's self-titled 'Black Album', of their early albums, this actually is the closest in sound to that one, but a little darker and heavier. Yes, it's thrash and has a bit of headbanger appeal, but it's more commercial than it gets credit for, as well, but not in a wimping out or poppy way.<br />1. Fight Fire With Fire -- The soft accoustic intro explodes (literally) into an anti-nuclear war speed metal headbanger. It's mostly got a thrash pace, but has a nice solo toward the end. It's still listenable, but not really one of my favorites. Not recommended for more pop/commercial oriented fans.<br />2. The title track is similar, but with more variation (aka better). Told from the point of view of a prison inmate on the electric chair, and also anti-death. A bit more anthemic, especially on the chorus and the bridge. It also features a long, fast, unforgettable solo. Had this come out 7+ years later, it could've been big.<br />3. For Whom The Bell Tolls -- The first of the now famous songs, a somewhat mid tempo, more commercial oriented metal anthem. This time, the theme is soldiers at war. Again, it's not wimping out at all, but it could appeal to metalheads as well as 80's AOR rock fans. Despite its 'hit' status today, it's still criminally underrated, one of their best.<br />4. Fade to Black -- Their very first noticeable change of pace and semi hit. This heavy, somewhat sensitive rocking ballad is often rumored to be about encouraging suicide, but, according to the band, it is not. It starts off slow but builds up to a medium 'rocker' about midway through. Somewhat dark yet happy, at strange as that sounds. One of their best songs. Why isn't this bigger than their '96-present cr*p!?<br />5. Trapped Under Ice -- A theme of being stuck under a block of ice and not being able to escape. Not too memorable, but not bad. Again, much more of a thrashy pace with several blazing solos.<br />6. Escape -- If there was a third commercial type song here, this would be it. It seems to be the least liked of the 8 tracks here, but I'll never know why. A bit more anthemic, particularly on the slower sung chorus, it's also lyrically the 'lightest', not dealing with death of any kind, but just being about finding peace with yourself and escaping. Hence the title, I guess.<br />7. Creeping Death -- The pace increases yet again with the Egyptian tale of pharoes and slaves' death. A definite thrasher but remains unique enough with its slightly exotic solo (in keeping with the theme, I suppose). Has become a concert favorite, with its &quot;Die, die, die, die!&quot; chant.<br />8. Call of the Ktulu -- A medium paced (for them) 9 minute guitar instumental with a darker sound. Since one of the things I love about music is words, I usually don't care as much for instrumentals, but I have to say, this one's pretty good. Still, it's the one I listen to the least.<br />Basically, headbangers - don't be turned off by the 2 (almost 3) now commercial tunes, there's plenty you'll love here. Mainstream rock/newer Metallica fans - you'll soon discover more than you thought you'd like here. Buried beneath the loud noise and screaming, it's very catchy and not as scary as it would appear on first listen.<br />Check my music reviews. I'm mostly into 80s rock (with quite a bit of classic rock, pop, and some 90s pop/rock). Most of the people reading this will probably laugh at some of the stuff I listen to - and heh, I invite you to (Loverboy, Phil Collins, Lionel Richie, Poison, Green Day, Gin Blossoms, Avril Lavigne, Rod Stewart, Eagles, etc).<br />Whoa, you guys still with me, or did you already vote 'not helpful'?

B00005Y6YB|3.0|First, 240 minutes is FOUR hours, not six (60 x 4 + 240) and old video books review this as being 8 hours of FILM, they don't include commercials.  This miniseries definitely ran more than 3 nights on television, so it has been chopped in half to make it affordable, I guess.  I could live with some trimming-- though it didn't seem long even when I watched it WITH commercials, but this is too far.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|What an INCREDIBLE swan song. This is more than you or I or the music industry deserve.<BR>As all the other reviews accurately  note, its the stark simplicity of the arangements and heart breaking experience of the man himself which make such a startling impression on the listener. Attempting to describe the pathos of this album wont serve the purpose, but buying it and devouring it will.<BR>There are some things I CAN tell you. I can tell you that if one were to strip away everything but &quot;I Hung My Head&quot;, &quot;Hurt&quot;, &quot;Streets of Leredo&quot; and the softly anthemic title track, one would still have an E.P. whose understated emotional impact easily topples the best work of Tool or Tori Amos. I don't say that to be insulting or exegerate the case. Consider this testimony: I have never enjoyed the artsy fartsy original versions of &quot;Hurt and &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;. But when these tunes are reborn through Johnny Cash, they are not only compelling but comand every ounce of my attention. Turns out it really is the singer not the song. you see, the legend of the Man in Black not only lends creative resonance<BR>to his unsteady and imperfect vocals but it gives him the quality of character. And that goes WAY past the music itself. To this end Rick Rubin utilizes the appropriately spare production and gives this recording a touch of intimacy whose effect actually surpases the raw power he acheived on Slayers &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. All this without distorted guitars, drums or marshal amps cranked past eleven.<BR>This is the type of thing that cant be manufactured or faked. Rest assured, Cash is the singular example of the true punk rock spirit in &quot;country&quot; music. And not in a self conscious way like Hank Williams III or some other contemporary examples.<BR>An astonishing record and I am enormously thankful to Mr. Cash for this moving last will and testament . Pain, redemption and more pain. Rest in peace Johnny, you've earned it.
0553801546|5.0|This book is a jumble of words that takes all the messy things in life and swirls them into a storm all about you, and never sets them down again.  All loose threads are tied off and yet life continues on, messy as ever, because that's just life.  I do not want to recount the plot because those that stuck with the series through it's last eight books will know where it must go - Buckkeep, Icefire's icy island, Tintaglia's blue skies and back again.  Knowing this was the last book in the story, the very last, I treasured each page.  And such is Robin Hobb's writing, that I could have accepted a dozen moments in the story as the conclusion.  There are so many moments of homecoming, looming gulfs of intrigue, hopelessness and bubbling hope, that a lesser writer could have accepted any one of them as the conclusion of this book.  Then, they could go on and write another book, and then another, from any of the plot twists here.<br /><br />Not Robin Hobb.  This is a heart pouring out, not a milking cow of a book.  The pacing is just what it should be.  In every place where she could have gone faster, and summarized instead of showing every detail, and left me wondering forever what that scene could have been like had it been more complete - she went all out, holding nothing back.  That's a gift and it is given in this book more times than I could count.  It's like the moments in your favorite books that you go back to over and over and reread every year.  Here, you can reread the whole book or any part of it and you'll never have enough, I think.  Her talent awes me and makes me green with envy.<br /><br />I could think of no more perfect conclusion to not just one, but three trilogies.  It is, in every way, a satisfying and crowning achievement, not least for the fact that it leaves a door open for unexpected futures to intrude.
0393057658|5.0|Who would have ever thought that taking the romance out of baseball would lead to one of the most engaging books of the year?  Lewis is a skilled storyteller with a great gift for characterization.  This book documents a fascinating revolution in the philosophy of building a professional baseball team.  Moneyball is the best nonfiction I have read since Positively Fifth Street!
B000004CYT|5.0|I must say that I have been listening to Beethoven's symphonies for a long time. I own interpretations by Karajan, Bernstein, Norrington, and Gardiner. Hogwood's set easily towers over them all. Since John Eliot Gardiner's cycle is the most critically acclaimed I will compare it with Hogwood. In Symphonies 1,2,4, and 8 Hogwood and Gardiner's renditions are the same. When It comes the third, Hogwood leads a brisk but not rushed preformance. The AAM sound so clear and bright and play their music emotionally. With Gardiner,I feel that he just chose his outrageous tempo just to make it different from the others, his orchestra sounds so mechanical. Coming to the fifth symphony; the major difference between Gardiner and Hogwood is the final movement. Gardiner takes it at jet speed while Hogwood allows the music to unfold by itself. In the pastoral, Hogwood manages  faster tempi than Gardiner but does not sacrafice the emotion of the music. Gardiner's sixth is equally impressive if one ignores the his tedious reading of the sixth's first movement. Hogwood and Gardiner's seventh do not differ that much in that Gardiner takes it slower in the last three movement of the symphony.<br />Now comes to all mighty ninth. Although the first three movements of the symohony sound the same, I prefer Hogwood's just because he maneges a better sound out of his orchestra. The two differ in the choral movement, Notably the \\"Ode to Joy\\" chorus. I must admitt that when I first listened to the chorus under Hogwood I thought it was going to be like Norrington's terrible reading of Beethoven's ninth. But then (I don't know how),Hogwood just made the music sound so grand that the slower tempo just seemed right. When I first heard Gardiner, I must say that adrenaline rushed through my head, but then I got bored with the recording. Other than the fast tempo Gardiner did not bring anything revolutionary to the ninth symphony. <br />I will just end this review by saying to the customers: Pick the interpretation that you like not the one that a music critic likes. Don't just read my review and believe that the Hogwood set is the best. Make your own descision.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Trek V has taken it on the chin so long kicking it when it's down doesn't seem fair. The script is riddled with plot holes, the optical effects (as noted before) are subpar for a Trek film. What's good about the film is the strong chemistry between the original cast (particularly Nimoy, Shatner and Kelly). Lawrence Luckinbill gives a marvelous performance as Sybok (in a role originally intended for Sean Connery). The film as a whole is less than the sum of its parts. With a number of strong sequences scattered throughout the film, it's tempting to take all the criticism at face value. All the Trek films have their merits but it seems this one has been unfairly condemned.<br />Sybok (Lawrence Luckinbill) a renegade Vulcan takes Federation, Klingon and Romulan representatives hostage on the &quot;planet of peace&quot;. This hideous dust ball of a world along the Neutral Zone suddenly becomes the center of the galaxy. It seems that Sybok has an unusual empathetic power to heal emotional and psychological wounds and has used this power to gather a cult of followers on his quest.<br />To complete his journey, however, he needs a powerful ship--a Starship. His dream comes true when the less than ship shape Enterprise is forced into action without adequate shake down time after drydock. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Chekov, Uhura and Scotty are supplemented by a skeleton crew and pushed into a commando raid on Paradise City where Sybok has taken refugee. He manages to take the senior personnel prisoner and take the Enterprise as well.<br />Most of the cast does an admirable job. Luckinbill is marvelous. Nimoy and Kelley have a number of sparing moments that rank with their best. Every cast member is given a moment to shine although some of those moments are better than others. Supporting player David Warner is completely wasted in his role as the alcholic Ambassador to the &quot;planet of peace&quot;. It's a pity as he's a marvelous actor. Take a look at his work in Time After Time or even The Undiscovered Country to see what he's capable of in a genre film.<br />Let's discuss the transfer first. There's a surprising amount of analog artifacts (i.e., dirt, hair, etc.)during the beginning of the film. That's rather a surprise given the stellar transfers for the other films in the series. The blacks are rock solid and the colors vivid. The clarity and picture in this anamorphic widescreen transfer looks sharp. While the film could have used a bit of cleaning up it looks, on the whole, very good.<br />The beautiful cinematography by Andrew Laszlo comes to life on this disc. While it isnt' quite as good as seeing it in the theater, it's pretty darn close.<br />The sound also sounds pretty good overall. It's presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and, while there isn't as much action in the surround speakers as I'd like, it's well balanced sounding with good clarity. Jerry Goldsmith's score is beautifully reproduced here (it's among his best scores which is ironic given the film's reception).<br />Shatner's commentary track isn't the most informative on the other hand, Shatner doesn't babble like Nick Meyer does on his commentary track for Wrath of Kahn and The Undiscovered Country. Still, the film could have benefited from a full cast commentary track much more than the other films in the series.<br />I haven't had a chance to check out all the special features but the outtakes and the cut sequences involving the rock creature are quite interesting. Sadly, Paramount wouldn't give Shatner the money to go back and digitally create the ending he originally had in mind. One can only imagine what the film would have looked like with an ending out of Dante's Inferno.<br />Shatner's feauturette shot at the Yosemite National Park rambles a bit but there are a couple of interesting moments there as well. It could have used a bit of tightening up in the editing department. The Journey: A Behind-the-Scenes Documentary provides interesting insights into why thefilm failed to find an audience. The Pre-Visualization Models sequence provides an idea of what Shatner was attempting to achieve with the film as does Rock Man in the Raw. In a sense, it's good the Rock Man costumes didn't work out although I do miss the opportunity to see the planet turned into a variation on Dante's Inferno. That would have been interesting and possible given today's CGI technology.<br />While Trek V was riddled with production problems, budget problems and other poltical issues, the film isn't horrible. Shatner, Harve Bennett and screenwriter David Loughery make the best of what they have at hand. Certainly some of the sequences might be offensive to hardcore Trekkers; the comedy bits in particular seem more like outtakes from a 3 Stooges film but they add levity to a story that could have been taken way too seriously.<br />The bottom line on Trek V--it's an enjoyable romp with the original crew. Remember folks, it's only a movie--entertainment--so take it in the spirit it was made in.the film failed to find an audience.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|this movie looks awsom at first. It has an interesting cast great reveiws and coupled with what should be an absorbing plot this seems like a no brainer. <BR>sadly we were duped.  the movie begins with promise there are a few rather humorous scenes in regards to the culture but that is it.  all hopes for the movie to pick up are dashed when the leads finally do meet halfway trough the film. the rest of the film is simply spent folowing them through kareoke bars and strip clubs. the entire film says nothing and the only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the always exceptional acting from bill and hopes that somehow the movie would end up saying somthing of interest.<BR>i think Gregory Weinkauf of NEW TIMES describes this movie, or lack there of, the best, \\"When work this potentially satisfying remains flatly obvious, it's almost worse than being flat-out bad.\\"
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation is an apt metaphor for the sense of dislocation, alienation and mid-life crisis felt by movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray) upon his arrival in Japan. Sofia Coppola's terrific new film captures Harris' little boy lost quality particularly well during the sequence when he's first met by his Japanese hosts in Tokyo. &quot;Translation&quot; focuses on the disconnect that we all can feel when lost in the maze of an alien culture (whether it be the culture of youth or another country).<br />Bob's in town to shoot a commercial for Japanese television when his path crosses that of Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) a woman who's marriage to her photographer husband is crumbling. These two lost souls manage to connect and a friendship blossoms between these two strangers in a strange land. Bob and Charlotte venture through the maze of Tokyo sharing a unique adventure that captures Bill Murray at his comedic best.<br />I have to admit I had my doubts about &quot;Translation&quot;. When neophyte director Sofita Coppola created the film &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; I was less than impressed. It seemed to borrow heavily from many other directors and projects without having a unique voice of its own. I'm happy to say that &quot;Translation&quot; demonstrates that Coppola's talent has blossomed. While her screenplay does occasionally teeter over the border into cliche, her writing demonstrates a surprising freshness missing from much of what we see from Hollywood.<br />An anamorphic widescreen transfer, &quot;Translation&quot; looks very good. The higher definition seen with an anamorphic transfer benefits the film particular during the night sequences. The DVD transfer isn't without flaws however as there are some compression artifacts. On the whole, though, the film looks quite good.<br />The sound mix is subtle but quite effective. This isn't an action movie, so the &quot;sound&quot; isn't as noticeable. Sound designer Richard Beggs creates an environment for the viewer that puts everyone in Bob's shoes.<br />Considering the high profile of the film, it's pretty weak on the extras. There is a by-the-numbers documentary on the making of the film. We also get  &quot;A Conversation&quot; with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola. It's not something you're likely to watch more than once. The inclusion of the &quot;City Girl&quot; music video and the standard extended and deleted scenes section isn't anything all that special. The latter does demonstrate that Coppola and her editor Sarah Flack knew exactly when to cut the various scenes in the film. The extended scenes, unlike some movies, don't provide any additional depth to most of the scenes.<br />No commentary to note which is a pity as I'd love to hear Murray riff on the various scenes particularly with his various co-stars. Oh well.<br /> &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a surprisingly memorable film. Sofia Coppola's original screenplay and direction bring what could have been a by-the-numbers film to life. It's not a film for everyone, though, as the slow pace (which captures the dreamy quality one feels when suffering from jetlag)will put some viewers off.

0440211727|5.0|John Grisham has written some good books and some bad ones.  A TIME TO KILL, his first novel, is not just good--it is great. As such, it stands alone among his work both for theme and for style.<br />The story is a compelling one, about a black man in a small Southern town, a town bigoted by definition, who openly kills the two white men who have raped his daughter.<br />The plot is exciting. Grisham grapples with moral issues as to right and wrong. The consequences of acting as both judge and jury in exacting justifiable revenge, but a revenge that nonetheless is in direct contradiction to civil law, is examined from many perspectives.<br />This book shows that Grisham is a fine lawyer, and that he also is a lyrical writer.

B0000C7GG2|5.0|After a promising debut (Showbiz) and a gloriously overwrought follow-up (Origin of Symmetry), the power trio Muse blends sharp song structures to operatic prog-rock on Absolution.  General comparisons to Queen and Radiohead are apt.  Matt Bellamy shares Freddie Mercury's love of bombast (and killer pipes) and Thom Yorke's romantic pessimism.  I'd add a third player here, namely for the vague sense of sci-fi they bring to the bash:  Rush.  Whereas on past efforts it was a game of spot-the-influences, Absolution finds the band, gamely augmented by bassist Chris Wolstenhome and dynamic drummer Dominic Howard, in its own rarified stratosphere.  Many of the tracks here were kick-started by the war in Iraq - specifically \\"Apocalypse Please\\" and \\"Butterflies &amp; Hurricanes\\" - and those that weren't are still marinated in anxiety and paranoia.  \\"It's time we saw a miracle,\\" Bellamy exhorts.  \\"It's time for something biblical.\\"  Here's a metal jeremiad that's worth the bombast.
B000068MKZ|4.0|Based on this album, Carla Bruni will have no trouble making the transition from catwalk to recording studio. Very dramatically better than most 1st-time LPs you'll hear, this record bodes well for Bruni's future, and for her audience. Most of the tracks are in French, one in CB's native Italian -- all sung with total conviction, expressiveness, and individuality. This is a serious record--don't hesitate!
B00008976Y|5.0|Blue is the color of sadness and depression. And &quot;Blue&quot; (&quot;Bleu&quot;) is the first film in the celebrated Colors trilogy by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Accompanying the rich &quot;Red&quot; (&quot;Rouge&quot;) and sharp &quot;White&quot; (&quot;Blanc&quot;), this is a beautiful and haunting look at grief and getting past it.<br />Julie de Courcy (Juliette Binoche) and her family are in a car accident when their brakes fail. Julie is injured, but her composer husband and their daughter die. She can't bring herself to commit suicide, but neither can she just go home and get over it. So instead she leaves her palatial house in the country after a night with her husband's old friend Olivier (Benoît R&eacute;gent), who has been in love with her for years.<br />Julie arrives in Paris with nothing but a blue cut-glass lampshade, takes back her maiden name, rents an apartment, and tries to leave her old life behind. Though she says she doesn't want love or friends (because they are &quot;traps&quot;), she befriends a promiscuous young woman and is pulled back to Olivier when he starts to finish her husband's unfinished work. In turn, Olivier reveals to her the side of her husband she never knew -- the other woman he loved.<br />The Colors trilogy is based on the colors of the French flag: Blue, white and red, standing respectively for liberty, equality, and fraternity. In this, Julie is unconsciously seeking liberty from her past life and her grief. This grief is shown beyond mere tears and unhappiness. She rakes her knuckles over a rough wall, rips off a strand off the hanging lampshade, as little ways of showing her inner turmoil. At the same time, the revelations about Julie's husband raises questions about their marriage and about Julie herself.<br />The powerful music celebrating the EU pops up periodically, often when Julie experiences strong emotion. At times, the screen goes dark, and the overwhelming, soaring symphony is all you can detect. And as Kieslowski does in &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Red,&quot; this film is sprinkled with color and symbolism. Blue crops up in little dancing bars of light on Julie's face, in her clothing, a swimming pool, in rain-slicked windows, a misty blue morning and a lollipop.<br />This may be Binoche's best performance. Her expressive eyes and subtle facial expressions convey every tormented or peaceful emotion that Julie feels. One of the best shots in the entire movie is the final one, in which we see Julie, unhappy and tearful, slowly starting to smile. (She also is shown weeping underwater, something I've never seen before) R&eacute;gent seems rather colorless beside Binoche's reverberating performance, but his quiet, sweet Olivier is an underrated character.<br />A harrowing, beautiful and ultimately romantic film, &quot;Blue&quot; brims over with pathos and beautiful direction.

0780020685|5.0|The &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is probably the best black and white film by Akira Kurosawa. Through this movie, the audience can learn a lot about ancient Japan, an example would be the caste system of traditional Japan. However, I believe the best facet of this movie is the values and beliefs of the Samuri. Great values such as honor, dignity, friendship and cooperation is presented.<br />Too bad that I can't rate this movie as a 6 star. :)
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Sofia Coppola's previous feature, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, received widespread praise, yet was one of the most banal movies ever shot on 35mm film.  Her second feature, LOST IN TRANSLATION, has received even more critical praise, plus 3 Golden Globe awards and Oscar nominations for best picture, screenplay, director, and actor.  Surely it must merit such accolades?<br />     Alas, it does not.  Although better than her previous turkey, LOST is yet another vapid distraction dolled up with multi-million dollar production values and A-list stars.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deserve praise for making something out of nearly nothing.  Their performances add some soul to characters whom the script paints as nothing more than bland types, devoid of singularity, identity, or development--paltry clichés at best.  They even manage to convey a sense of epiphany in their final scene together, which hinges on an utterly unintelligible line he mutters into her ear.  (Even captioning on the DVD reports it as \\"Whispering, indistinct.\\"  Perhaps he said something like, \\"Is this a new low for Deus ex machina--God rescuing the screenwriter instead of the hero?\\")<BR>  <BR>     Since the story is obviously not about character, or conflict, or action, perhaps it is about ennui.  Unfortunately Ms Coppola does not understand the imitative fallacy in art.  The pace drags, with more than half an hour spent establishing the characters' alienation and boredom--already adequately established in the film's opening minutes.  In more skilled hands, the material implicit in the story might make a good feature length movie.  As is, it might make a good 20 minute short.  Too bad the film lasts 104 minutes.  (Yawn.)<br />     Though failing as story, the movie might succeed in what film is really about anyway-visual imagery.  It does boast a capable cinematographer, Lance Acord (of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH fame), and was filmed on location in Japan, offering a wealth of opportunity for exotic, beautiful, interesting images.  Acord delivers some nice shots of Tokyo's pulsating lights, a Buddhist monastery, and temple grounds in Kyoto, for instance, and he even makes a hotel pool momentarily interesting.  But the script mostly confines him to banal urban interiors and clogged city streets, not much different wherever you go in the world.  We have seen it all before (including the gratuitous nudity), and there is nothing in this movie to make us want to see it again.  (Sigh.)<br />     Finally, since the story focuses on two Yanks adrift in Japan, Japan itself plays a major role in the film.  Sadly, Ms Coppola offers no insight into Japanese culture, character, or values, presenting only superficial glimpses reinforcing well-worn stereotypes:  Japanese talk funny, adulate Westerners, sing karaoke, bow frequently, eat strange food, play video games, etc.  (Ho-hum.)<br />     LOST IN TRANSLATION gets 2 stars out of 5-both for the acting.  One star for Bill Murray, at last recognized for the dramatic ability in evidence since MEATBALLS (and blatantly obvious since MAD DOG AND GLORY).  The other for the rest of the cast: Johansson (believable though out of her element), Ribisi (perfect as the adolescent, self-absorbed husband), and Faris (the ditzy blonde starlet-at least I think she was acting).  And to the critics who praised this movie (and Ms Coppola's previous lame effort), I give a big, fat goose egg.
B00005JMCW|3.0|If you a looking for a children's movie, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; is the one you want. The kids will absolutly love it!<br />In &quot;Freaky Friday,&quot; the relationship between daughter and mother, sister and brother, friends and friends or enemies are portrayed in the some how chaotic (and filled with detention)life of the main character. The clever banters and arguments are one of the facets that makes this movie as a acceptable entertainment. <br />For adults and teenagers, this movie might seem stupid for the storyline had been played by other movies as well. However, a part that  might grabs the attention of teenagers are the music played by the band, Pink Slip, of the main character. &quot;Ultimate&quot; and &quot;Take Me Away&quot; are two pretty good songs that make the movie a lot more lively.
0671027387|3.0|This book was OK as a beach vacation page turner.  Is is a thriller, but not nearly as good as the Da Vinci Code, which I loved despite the hokey dialogue between the two protagonists.  Like the Da Vinci Code, Deception Point contains hokey dialogue, but it's so bad that it detracts from the storyline.  It's just not credible and certainly not realistic.  Dan Brown needs to work on dialogue.  Also, the plot twists and ending are clever and surprising, but so strained that they go beyond the intended surprise ending and are just plain silly.  Bottom line: don't buy this book, but if you're stuck somewhere with not much else to read and some time to kill, it's mostly entertaining, but not great.
B000007S5B|5.0|Waiting For The Sun was the Doors' only #1 album and spawned a #1 single in &quot;Hello, I Love You.&quot; While not nearly as strong as Morrison Hotel and not having as many defining tracks as their debut, Waiting For The Sun is another classic album from the Doors and it doesn't get the recognition that it deserves.<br />Overall, this album saw the band entering the softer direction they'd continue on The Soft Parade but still have the darker material of their first two albums. Tracks like &quot;Love Street&quot;, &quot;Summer's Almost Gone&quot;, and &quot;Yes, The River Knows&quot; all have beautiful melodies and feature some of Jim Morrison's most passionate vocals. There's also great pop songs here with the aforementioned &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;, &quot;We Could Be So Good Together&quot;, and &quot;Wintertime Love.&quot; The tracks &quot;My Wild Love&quot; and &quot;Five To One&quot; found the band at their most primitive with their monotone backing chants and simple riffs. &quot;Spanish Caravan&quot; with its flamenco guitar and its carnival organ is the band at its most psychedelic. As with The Doors and Strange Days, this album was to also have a long epic entitled &quot;The Celebration Of The Lizard.&quot; However, the record company wouldn't allow it, only allowing the haunting &quot;Not To Touch The Earth&quot; on the album. Finally, there's the graphic &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, one of their most enduring tracks, which was banned from radio shortly after its release due to its reenactment of a soldier getting shot. Another great album. Highly recommended.
B00005NKK8|4.0|Although the movie soundtrack is truly great, featuing a cross-section of the greates music of the 60's and 70's, the CD is incomplete. It lacks several tracks which were  in the movie, including the Jimi Hendrix version of &quot;All Along the Watchtower,&quot; and &quot;Red, White and Blue.&quot; However, the presence of the other featured greats more than make up for it.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park is one of those bands that don't follow the trail that other &quot;rappers&quot; like Limp Bizkit and Korn. they write their own lyrics, co-produce their cds, and are more original than anything else out there. I must say, I would rather listen to Incubus, but hey, what's good is good. Oh, another thing, y r all the people that give the 1-star reviews say that it is bad nu-metal. Guess what!? it isn't supposed to be &quot;nu metal.&quot; It is nore or less rap/rock/electronica. The nice touches by Mike Shinoda and Mr. Hahn are the best by almost any other band out there. So quit trying to come up with unjustifyed complaints, and listen to your old rock (i do have alot of respect for classic rock mind u). Bye it, u probably won't regret it, unless u have been brain washed by the people that hate this cd.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I've had this cd for a few years now and i still find myself playing it on repeat.  Fiona Apple has on of the most distinguished, amazing voices ever and her lyrical poetry reinforces her talents as a singer/songwriter.  Though the songs are in regards to love and individuality and hate, you will leave feeling overwhelmed by a sense of self.  Ms. Apple's music is that of perfection in the dark and i can see no other artist gaining the momentum she already has.  Can't wait for the new album this year, &quot;Extraordinary Machine&quot;!!!!!
B000002MTR|5.0|So often I hear people bash this album. Whatever is so &quot;terrible&quot; about this album, I'm sorry, but I'm missing it. This is certainly different from the Pepper's other work, and I think takes a few listens to get used to, but once you do, it is sooooooo completely worth it. It may simply be that it isn't popular amongst Peppers fans to support Navarro because he isn't Fruciante. I love both, and there's nothing wrong with that! The album gets off to a good, but unexpected start with &quot;Warped.&quot; &quot;Aeroplane&quot; is one of the Chili Pepper's best tracks, in my opinion. &quot;My Friends&quot; is the closest thing to a hit on this album, and it's pretty good. &quot;Coffee Shop&quot; doesn't sound like the Chili Peppers, but it's interesting. I like &quot;Walkabout&quot; and &quot;Shallow Be Thy Game.&quot; And last, but not least, the great &quot;Transcending.&quot; I love that song, and if you give it half a chance, you will too. Some hate this album, but don't let them deter you. Only you can decide.
0385474547|4.0|Achebe, in Things Fall Apart, does what few literary or non-academic authors have been able to accomplish: he separates Africa from its people while retaining their inherent Africanism. His characters are not, outside of their African names, chiefly black or white, Nigerian or Somalian, or polytheist or missionary, more than they are human beings. Few would argue that characters in a book surrounding events occurring on African soil should or even could be separated on a very real basis from their roles as Africans themselves. Yet Achebe has managed to make readers view Okonkwo as a human being, faults or not, and Mbaino or Umuofia as locations larger than being simply known as towns or villages in Nigeria. <br />The journey of Okonkwo is a journey that most human beings embark upon in their lifetimes. From childhood confidence to adulthood faltering, strength from birth to weakness at death, Okonkwo is more than just a Nigerian; he could be any of us. What makes him transcend the barriers of culture and geography is that he need not be black to be important; his experiences as a human make him important because they are very real experiences capable of being experienced by any person, Nigerian or Norwegian, black or white. <br />The culture surrounding Okonkwo is not necessarily or exclusively Nigerian. We may find that such experiences transpired in Chinese cultures or in Native American or First Nations cultures as well as hundreds of other ancient and not-so-ancient cultures and locales. This is the beauty of Okonkwo and his tale. Achebe brings enough of Nigeria to us to make us realize that there is also some part of us in Nigeria.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I didn't like the Stripes initially, but a coworker played this CD constantly at work and it won me over. Now I can listen to the entire CD. The weakest tracks are &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot; (Sorry, Meg!), and &quot;Ball &amp; Bisquit&quot; which is just too long. Sure there are songs that are longer on many CDs, but this one just is too repitious. After the first few minutes, it offers nothing new. I usually skip it, although sometimes if I'm in the mood, it's worth a listen. The intro to &quot;Little acorns&quot; can also get annoying with repeated listens, although the rest of the song is pretty rockin. Major thumbs up for &quot;Seven Nation Army,&quot; and &quot;Black Math.&quot; Most of the rest of the CD is also really good, although &quot;Hypnotize&quot; sounds a little too much like &quot;Fell In Love With a Girl.&quot; Overall, probably my favorite album of 2003, although admittedly, there wasn't much competition that year. The only other truly great release was Jane's Addiction's comeback album &quot;Strays.&quot; But that's a story for another day!
0894803123|5.0|BUY THIS BOOK.  If you have an ice cream maker, you would be a fool not to buy this book.  Most people do not look forward to tasting my &quot;homemade ice cream&quot;, but since I started using these recipes, I am making ice cream for more than just my own house.  The recipes taste just like their brand, except even fresher!  A MUST HAVE!!
B00008NG5V|2.0|And while I liked the first album a lot, I don't mean that as a compliment. This album sounds so much like his first album that buying it is simply unnecessary. I already had a copy of Brushfire Fairytales and I want my money back!! There are generally two types of complaints that follow the release of an artist's sophomore CD: (1) It's too different! I wanted it to be like the first CD or (2) It's too similar. I want to see some musical growth! These kind of complaints make it difficult for an artist to produce something that's not going to earn some critism. But some artists slightly alter their formula, but make it similar enough to be accessible. Not true with Johnson. He didn't change his sound at all. And the second time around, it's just not as entertaining. Although I like &quot;Times Like These,&quot; for the most part I want to fall asleep listening to this, and normally mellow music makes me feel all right. Go with Brushfire instead, or try listening to Dispatch's masterpiece &quot;Bang Bang.&quot;

6303471714|4.0|I don't know about Joan but i thought this workout was good. I first had doubts after i first viewed it because it seemed like it wouldn't work but then i gave it a try. And guess what? The next day my body was all soar and when going up the steps i was like ow ow! LoL And my abs are actually more fit now! =D I have to admit that her form is really bad because she flings herself a lot and has very little control, which is bad for your back actually. But now that you know, during the workout just don't fling as much and control your back.<br />There are three workouts in this tape. The first workout is 45 minutes long. It starts out with a warm up. Then, they go into exercises that are supposed to stretch and tone your lower body with a lot of leg movements standing up. Then, you work on your arms. You do 30 pushups (with a stop after each 10). You work on your chest and back and your shoulders with weights in this one. Then, you work on your abs with two sets. Then you have the cool down.<br />The second workout is 40 minutes long and is suposed to strengthen your muscles. You do sets of three in this workout. You start out with a warm up again. You start out with strengthening your lower body and a couple of flings from the first workout. Then you do HARD arm workouts. (and i mean HARD lol) Then you go to the abs again and a little butt workout and then a cool down.<br />The last workout is a mini 10-minute workout without weights. You basically do pushups, situps, warmup, cooldown, and some leg exercises. So that's pretty good.<br />Honestly i think she does some of her exercises WAY too fast so you can slow it down a bit if you like. And don't fling yourself so much, remmeber! My fave workout would have to be the second one. Cindy is a great down-to-earth trainer but just needs a little control in her movements. THis workout is mainly for advanced beginners to beginning advanced.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Gladiator has been called unworthy of the best picture Oscar is got by many critics. At one time I thought it was great but not Best Picture worthy as well. However now that I think about it, it deserved it. Okay the WWE like announcing of the Gladiators is silly like critic Roger Ebert made referrence to. He had other problems with the movie none were solid reasons not to like it. Here's all the reasons to like it. The cast is strong especially Russel Crowe in the lead, the direction is excellent, the story is well told and the battle scenes are fantastic. Okay the movie uses a lot of Special Effects for Rome when old movies like Ben-Hur were made impressively without such technology being available at the time. So what though, whether you think the visuals  look good or not they don't hold the movie down and they aren't what make the movie so strong anyway.<br />  The movie is still one of the most entertaining movies you'll see and it's a shame that Roger Ebert sat down and picked it apart because there's nothing that makes it bad...at all. Ok some things might be un-accurate to the time period.  Still though if you ignore such things and let the story and Russel Crowe's performance take hold of you I don't see how it's possible not to like it then. The supporting work by Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, the late great Oliver Reed and late great Richard Harris are all fine as well. My point is that despite minor flaws Gladiator is still a very good movie and deserved that Best Picture award!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Santa Esmarelda's &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misundersood&quot; is the stand out track on this unsurprisingly fantastic soundtrack from Mr.Tarantino (who brought us fab soundtracks in the form of Pulp Fiction, Resivior Dogs and Jackie Brown).It's all here with some cool movie segments.If you saw you film, you must have loved the music, so you should love this!
B0001611DI|5.0|Though this may be the single disc with little or no special features it's already on my pre-order list. This movie rocks! George A. Romero sure did step up to claim the next best sequel in horror movie history with Dawn of the Dead.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I thought this was a wonerful movie. But being a rabid Matrix fan probably biases my review slightly. The only thing that kept this from getting 5 stars was that the first half hour or so I thought was very dull and the fact that if I had not seen the first Matrix, I would've had no idea at all what some of the parts were about. <br />The positive points are the awesome extras and featurettes (including a hilarious parody from the MTV movie awards), an awesome battle scene and lots of interesting new characters. I urge even the mild fans of the 1st movie to see this movie.
B00005JM20|5.0|This movie had some things in it that I dfidn't mind, really, but for a PG movie they were pretty inapporipate.  <BR>But ovewrall, it's a very funny movie.
B00009TB5G|5.0|i would like to know who you think is more of a fairy in LOTR, than Jack Sparrow in POTC.  Really, im curious.  reading your review i felt angry, not that you hate LOTR; i could care less what you think.  You frighten me; you sound like someone who would murder a homosexual for no reason.  eric t miller better be an alias; you sure arent making any friends here.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil is a more satisfying comics based action movie than I had expected.  Like all Marvel heroes, he is troubled and battles his internal demons as much as he fights the bad guys (in fact, they all have more success with the bad guys than their personal problems).  This movie has a pervasive sense of loss even greater than Spiderman or Hulk.<br />Ben Affleck is pretty good as the sightless hero who aches over his murdered father (very well played by David Keith).  Jennifer Garner is beautiful and athletic - a fine choice for Elektra Natchios.  The rain effects that allow Daredevil (Murdock / Affleck) to \\"see\\" her are neat and touching (although one does wonder why wind currents wouldn't do the same thing).<br />I also enjoyed Colin Farrel as Bullseye and Michael Clark Duncan as The Kingpin.  It does seem to me that the whole conflict with Kingpin is a bit underdone.  The big fight in the movie is with Bullseye, but he is just a paid assassin.  Daredevil has an even greater reason to hate Kingpin and yet that fight is fairly simple and over in a few minutes.<br />Jon Favreau is terrific as Murdock's law partner and comic foil and Derrick O'Connor adds a lot as Murdock's priest, confessor, and father figure.  Joe Pantoliano is always good, and here he plays the smart reporter who is trying to figure Daredevil out.  Good acting.  All of this could have been so much less than it ended up being, but the quality of acting adds some depth to these characters that makes it more enjoyable.  My youngest son wants there to be a Daredevil II and I wouldn't mind seeing it with him.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Besides the amazing extra footage that comes on this DVD (actually put into the movie; love it!), my favorite features are the commentaries.  Most entertaining commentary; the one by the cast.  Sure, it's slower at some times than others, but it would definitely be worth your time to watch the whole thing.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are absolutely hilarious; they make me laugh so hard I cry.  Funniest ever during the scene at the Entmoot.<br />Mmmm...Pumpernickel...<br />Anyway, if you are a huge fan of the LOTR movies/books, you absolutely must get this DVD to experience this phenomenon to the utmost.
0385504209|1.0|Am I the only reader on this planet who does not think Dan Brown's &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is a wonderful book?  Who thinks, in fact that it is a rather bad book?  Badgered by any number of friends who consider themselves serious readers, I finally broke down and read it myself.  I was underwhelmed.<br />For starters, I don't appreciate lectures in suspense thrillers.  Brown continually interrupts the story to drone on about the history of Paris or London, and, more verbosely, the &quot;history&quot; on which the story is based.  Entire chunks of the book read like a tarted up Michelin guide.<br />Deep into the novel Brown briefly acknowledges his debt to a few religious &quot;history&quot; books, most of which assert claims seriously questioned by scholars.  Presumably Brown wants to assure his readers that he is not making all this stuff up, and that he has spent many tedious hours unearthing this arcane knowledge.  Actually all these books have been available to the public for years.  Evidently relying on the public's short attention span (or impatience with any book containing footnotes), Brown announces all his &quot;revelations&quot; in breathless prose suggesting hot-off-the-press news.<br />Briefly, its main premise is that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, they had a child, or children, and their descendants are alive in France today.  This knowledge is protected by an ancient secret society, the Priory of Sion, loathed by the Vatican for obvious reasons.  One of the Priory's Grand Master's was Leonardo da Vinci.  Great stuff, thought Brown.  The making of a terrific thriller.<br />But wait.  I keep calling &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; a thriller.  True enough, it offers a lot of what thrillers these days strut: cool cars, private planes, luxurious digs, fancy gadgetry, narrow escapes, etc.  The dust jacket, however, announces itself as a novel.  Well, the reader will look in vain for the usual hallmarks of a good novel, namely, well-developed characters in whom the reader takes an interest, and well-turned prose testifying to the author's passion for the language.  I couldn't have cared less what happened to the inane protagonists.  Their conversations are part comic book, part encyclopedia entry, and their adventures are told in a curiously flat, dull style reminiscent of a weather report.<br />Perhaps I wouldn't be so annoyed by this book if it didn't exude such ambitious pretensions.  I caught Brown on a TV talk show, and it seems the man really thinks he has struck a blow for feminist theology.  That's a claim about as ridiculous as the assertion that the James Bond Series is an eloquent plea for democracy.<br />I have no doubt that Brown wrote &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; with the intention of selling the movie rights.  He is already imagining the cast -- Langdon, the main character, is described as &quot;Harrison Ford in Harris tweed.&quot;  Well, doubtless the movie will be better than the book.  I can't envision any actor agreeing to interrupt an adventure to spout a lot of dubious scholarship, or worse, fatuous art criticism.<br />But I pity the script writers.n whom the reader takes an interest, and well-turned prose testifying to the author's passion for the language.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|The main thing that keeps this from getting 5 stars is that the DVD is short on extra features.  The first Matrix DVD had tons more extra features, and it fit on one disc.  For some reason The Matrix Reloaded DVD needs two discs for fewer features.  What I particularly miss is the commentary track.  Where is this?  Also, the white rabbit mode in the first Matrix DVD was a neat idea, but they chose to not do any of this for Reloaded.<br />The above mentioned gripe aside, I thought the audio and visual encoding on the disc was excellent.  The movie itself, I thought was about as good as anybody could expect given the high expectations.  Of course, after seeing the third movie, I feel that Reloaded wasn't as good as I'd originally thought (some things that were overly complicated in Reloaded would have been fine had they resolved them in Revolutions, but they did not), but I guess I shouldn't factor that into my review.<br />If you are a Matrix fan, get this DVD... or perhaps hold out and maybe they will release a special addition which will have the extra features I want (that will really make me mad).

I'm not gonna bother telling you what it's about as countless other people before me have already done so, but let's just say it was deserving of winning 6 Oscars in my opinion.  My favourite scenes are All That Jazz, Roxie and Razzle Dazzle - my favourite song from the show.  All in all, if you don't own this or if you haven't seen it - what are you waiting for???
6305657947|5.0|There is very little not to like about this movie that is a gem among the genre of heist/caper movies.  As many are aware, this 1999 movie is a remake of the 1968 original starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, a movie that I haven't taken the time to watch yet but this remake certainly prompts one to do so.  The on screen relationship between Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo is one of those rare ones that works extremely well when combined with an intriguing script; all making for an excellent movie watching experience.<br />The performances given by Mr. James Bond himself, Pierce Brosnan and by Rene Russo were perfect for this movie.  I've heard many people state that the topless scenes with Rene Russo were gratuitous for this movie, which is an opinion I do not share.  It fits easily with her character that has spent a fair amount of time in Europe which could easily lessen ones shyness about such things.  Denis Leary's performance in this movie was pretty much on par with his past performances.<br />Director John McTiernan, known for several big movies such as &quot;The Hunt for Red October,&quot; &quot;Predator&quot; and &quot;Die Hard,&quot; does a wonderful job of making &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; in his vision, an even bigger movie than the script calls for.  Everything about this great heist movie is thrilling in its sleekness and style making it an enjoyable film whether it be the first or the fifth time you've watched it and much of the credit for that goes to director John McTiernan and the performances given by Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.<br />The Premise:<br />Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is an extraordinarily wealthy business man who has become too bored with life and has found a way to bring a bit of a thrill to it by engineering the perfect crime; stealing a painting worth one hundred million dollars from a New York gallery.  In comes, Catherine Olds Banning (Rene Russo) who works for the insurers of that painting and her mission is to find the thief and the painting...<br />What follows from there is one of the most ingenious heist/caper movies that I've watched in quite some time that, for the first time viewer, will certainly have you on the edge of your seat as director John McTiernan takes you through the paces of the script, wondering if Thomas Crown will be caught and lose all or will he get away with his &quot;perfect&quot; crime.<br />I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films within this genre!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Feature Length Audio Commentary by John McTiernan<BR>-Collectible Booklet<BR>-Theatrical Trailers from both the 1968 and 1999 films
B00006RIO7|3.0|Chicago is one of the best films I've ever seen and the soundtrack is the perfect companion to the film.  I gave it 5 stars even though the last two tracks I always skip as they aren't featured in the movie and are probably there to appeal to young audiences, but they're unnecessary and not my sort of thing.  But those songs couldn't dampen my appreciation for this music for one second.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere along with the ensemble cast including Queen Latifah and John C. Reily have made this production of the soundtrack an awe-inspiring experience.  Here's my opinion on each of the songs featured:<br />1. OVERTURE/AND ALL THAT JAZZ (5/5) One of the standout songs and probably the most well-loved and well-known of all Chicago songs it was important it set the mood for the movie and for Velma to really belt it out.  Catherine Zeta-Jones shows off her great musical beginnings in all her numbers, particularly this one, where she makes Velma her own.  One of the best produced songs on the soundtrack.<br />2. FUNNY HONEY (4/5) First song by Renee Zellweger (Roxie) doesn't disappoint, with the sultry desire of Roxie handled just right by Zellweger.  It only got 4 stars because it's a slower song, and one that's got to &quot;grow&quot; on the listener.  But Renee handles it with class.<br />3. WHEN YOU'RE GOOD TO MAMA (4/5) Who knew Queen Latifah could belt one out?? Not me until I saw Chicago.  But yet this is a standout song, and Latifah handles it well, showing off her brazen voice.<br />4. CELL BLOCK TANGO (5/5) Most people seem to adore this song and I can see why.  It has the catchy hook, the clever lyrics and the thumping bass.  Watch out for Mya as a murderess in this.  A definite highlight.<br />5. ALL I CARE ABOUT (4.5/5) Richard Gere: another surprise in the singing stakes.  He sounds good, cept here he isn't given much room to show off his voice like in other songs.  But he does this song justice, &quot;and then some&quot;!<br/>6. WE BOTH REACHED FOR THE GUN (5/5) Whoever's idea it was to set the scene as Billy Flynn puppeteering Roxie's every move should be rewarded.  It works so well that I can't think of the scene being played out any other way now.  Billy Flynn has fun on this track that it clever, cunning and everything you believe that Billy Flynn is.<br />7. ROXIE (4.5) After this song, the name on your lips will be &quot;Roxie&quot;.  Renee's second song is better than the first and you can tell she's fully involved in making Roxie a part of her.  A definitive song from the musical.<br />8. I CAN'T DO IT ALONE (4/5) This song is sort of a little bit strange, because in the movie Catherine is dancing where there's no singing, but of course on a CD you don't have visual so all you hear is &quot;I'd go...&quot;, &quot;We'd go...&quot; and the like.  Still a fun track if you can remember the scene in the movie and put together the missing pieces.<br />9. MISTER CELLOPHANE (4.5/5) John C. Reily shines in this heartwrenching song of how no one, least of all his wife Roxie, notices him.  John C. Reily portrayes Amos with the &quot;less is more&quot; approach, and it works.  He really is the heart of the show.<br />10. RAZZLE DAZZLE (5/5) My personal favourite, this lets Richard Gere take centre stage of a three-ring circus, showcasing his talents to Roxie and to the listener.  A catchy melody with a fitting message, it's a definite standout and like I mentioned, my favourite song from the musical.<br />11. CLASS (4/5) This was taken out of the director's cut of the movie but luckily appears on the soundtrack.  It's a worthwhile song and Catherine and Latifah's vocals gel beautifully here.  Not a standout though.<br />12. NOWADAYS (ROXIE) (4.5/5) Renee belts out the feelings of Roxie Hart in this, her last solo.  You can really feel what she's singing about, which is true testament to the talents of Zellweger.  The interchange to the theatre is a little odd on CD however.<br />13. NOWADAYS/HOT HONEY RAG (4.5/5) The final encore where Velma and Roxie realise the evil of their ways and laugh in its face.  Halfway through it becomes an instrumental and again it lacks something as we cannot see the brilliant choreography during this part, but the music is just a delight.<br />14. I MOVE ON (4/5)  Played during the credits, it's an original song that fits together the pieces of the show and brings it to a fitting end.
B000002HMH|4.0|I'm sick of this album getting slagged off as 'Pop', this stuff is not pop. The logic of some reviewers here seems to be that when a heavy metal band don't become so heavy anymore, they're 'pop'. Such is the mind of a Metal Head. James Hetfields lyrics here are top notch, significantly better than any of the lyrics from the previous Metallica albums. They take on a more emotional meaning, and the bands music and James's singing back this up. Sure it has its throw aways, however, this is only a small proportion of the songs. This is not a band selling out, this is a band exploring. If you're a narrow minded metal-head, don't get the album. If you like quality music, buy this album.<BR>(By the way, Bleeding Me is one of the best Metallica songs there is)
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I have been a fan of this show since it first premiered on our screens 3 or so years ago.  SInce then I've been hooked.  I'm so excited that Gilmore Girls is finally getting the DVD treatment.  In my opinion it is the best-written comedy on TV and is my favourite show.  The characters have such great comedict timing and chemistry and the storylines keep getting better and better.  If other less-worthwhile shows can get the DVD nod, thank goodness someone saw the light and ran with it.
0780628551|4.0|Depp was great as Spencer in this movie. I loved the fact that he scared the crap out of me, I loved his southern accent and he was so gorgeous with chesnut hair in this movie. I hope Johnny plays more scary characters. He plays it quite well. Charlizes acting was good also. Very good movie. And Surprising ending.

0060194995|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful book. I especially love the child's perspective it is written from. Somehow, putting it that way makes the racism and cruelty portrayed all the more horrific.<BR>The characters are very realistic (which is a big issue with me!) and the plot, while simple, is very intriguing. This is a sad story for the most part, but it also has great hope, because it shows that there are courageous people in the world who are willing to stand against culture and fight for the rights of those whom no one cares about.<BR>If you have not read this book, you must; it is well worth it.

0815411839|5.0|This is the most in-depth look at Miss Monroe's life from birth to death. The times and dates that Mr. Spoto was able to resurrect will amaze you, I have never seen so much detail in a book. Once I started reading it I could not put it down much to my wife's dismay. You will actually get to know Norma Jean and Marilyn as well as anyone in her life, a great read!
B000002TP7|5.0|The production of this album is very unique...lo-fi yet ingenious and thoroughly engaging.  Great use of the upright bass, despite Yauch's admission that he's a \\"hack.\\"  The CD just oozes with creativity and flavor.  It's best to play this on a hot summer day and cruise through a dirty but interesting urban neighborhood like South Street in Philadelphia or Greenwich Village in New York.  Excellent transition between tracks too, I love it when albums flow seamlessly from one song to the next.  I hate to call this \\"rap\\" because that brings to mind people like P. Diddy and Jay-Z.  It actually sounds more like an urban jazz-punk-hip-hop fusion than \\"rap\\" and is influenced more by \\"London Calling\\" than   \\"Raising Hell.\\"  Most of the vocals sound like they're coming through a walkie-talkie, which of course was very intentional and works much better than one would think.  Here's a track-by-track analysis:<br />1) Sure Shot -- Perfect opener.  Sets the tone extremely well.  That flute sample is golden and there is some fabulous interplay between the rappers.<br />2) Tough Guy -- Great hardcore punk song...will definitely get your adrenaline pumping.<br />3) Freak Freak -- Crazy effects and nearly inaudible rapping somewhat detract from this one, but it is still a fun listen.<br />4) Bobo on the Corner -- great percussion instrumental that warms you up for...<br />5) Root Down -- Gotta love Jimmy Smith's organ...such a tasteful choice for a sample.  Songs like these make one realize how uninspired most rappers and producers are with their sampling decisions.  <br />6) Sabotage -- Listen all y'all...if you don't stomp your feet or snap your fingers or do SOMETHING to the notorious THUMP-THUMP, THUMP-THUMP riff, you might just want to check your pulse.<br />7) Get it Together -- Q-Tip makes a most welcome appearance.  Bravo!<br />8) Sabrosa -- Suddenly the production quality becomes much clearer for this sinfully funky instumental.<br />9) The Update -- Solo rapping gig by MCA...nice bongos and I don't know what that other clicking sound is...<br />10) Futterman's Rule -- Ambient instrumental that bludgeons you with a groovy bassline until you submit.<br />11) Alright Hear This -- \\"Hip-hop supervision,\\" indeed.  AWESOME upright bassline.<br />12) Eugene's Lament -- Excellent mood piece featuring a violinist that is totally off the hook.<br />13) Flute Loop -- another good flute sample, but a little too short...1:45???<br />Okay, it's getting late, but I think you get the picture.  Classic CD that is matched only by Paul's Boutique.  Never a dull moment and innovative the whole way through.  Highly recommended.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|We've had the New Rock Revolution : the Strokes, The Hives, the Vines. We've had the bands that spawned in the Radiohead aftermath, like Coldplay, Doves, Travis and Starsailor. But what's this? This, my friends, is the latest album by Devon trio Muse, who stand completely alone. And, may I add, they don't sound anything like Radiohead. I absolutely adore Radiohead, but it's rather unfair to compare Thom Yorke to Muse's lead singer Matthew Bellamy. They both have beautiful voices, but they each utilise it very differently. Matt's vocal range is much greater than Thom's, and he can reach notes that a lot of female soprano's can't. The 'Radiohead' sound on the previous albums was the result of Muse hiring former RH producer John Leckie. He is, however, not present on this album, so that Muse's sound vastly improves. Matt's love of classical music, specifically the Russian composers, is no secret, and it shows. Muse seem to have ditched the futuristic, 'spacey' synths of OOS for the grand piano. Somehow Muse manage to rock out and still maintain their classical ground. The single Stockholm Syndrome starts of with a heavy guitar riff, and Matt yelling about death and decay, when it is suddenly swept away by a very delicate sounding string-laden chorus and a tinkling piano, while Matt's voice soars above in hushed tones. Falling Away With You is a very fragile and delicate love song. It is followed by a short interlude, which somehow resembles Barber's Adagio for Strings. Another great song is Blackout, a slow, string-laden song resembling something written by Tchaikovsky, with a choir and what sounds like a balalaika. Then we come to the great stand-out track, Butterflies and Hurricanes, where an orchestra is employed. The title should be taken very literally. The song starts off slowly, then rises to a crescendo, while Matt is singing 'best, gotta be the best'. It's the most classical song on the album, it has a vaguely spanish-sounding rhythm and melody and there are hardly any guitars. Suddenly, when the song slows down and the strings fall away, Matt launches into a piano solo reminiscent of the great master himself, Sergei Rachmaninoff. It almost made my jaw drop from amazement. Forget Bocelli or Vanessa Mae, this is what classical crossover should sound like. The only flaw on Absolution is that the lyrics are a little weak and not too subtle. Then again, a lot of classical music isn't very subtle either. It lacks the flaws of OOS, the main being that there wasn't a very good balance between loud and softer songs, which was rather boring. It is obvious that a lot more attention has been paid to Muse's latest offering. Absolution is a carefully constructed sonic cathedral: beautiful, ambitious and intricate. You will not be disappointed.
1573229725|4.0|Fingersmith was highly recommended by a friend with similiar tastes. How right she was! I loved this book! There's no need for me to review the plot as others have done a marvelous job before me but I do want to make these points.  Fingersmith has everything a reader wants in a historical novel: orphans and pickpockets, cruel men and resourceful heroines, plus a good look at the seamier side of Victorian England. The reader will also enjoy lesbian romance tastefully done, betrayal, alas most foul, and mystery and surprises you won't believe!  On a serious  note, this novel presents us with the many ways Victorian men could manipulate and control the women in their lives with no fear of retribution. This angle makes it a particularly good choice for any book group.<br />Ms. Waters writes in a such a marvelously descriptive style that I could almost smell the smog-fouled London air, or feel the rough canvas of the madhouse walls. Her characters are well-rounded and sympathetic.  Fingersmith would have rated five stars but I thought it got a little wordy here and there.
6305181772|3.0|Mission: Impossible is one of the rare-good spy movies out there.  In almost every way, it surpasses M:I-2 in terms of story, suspense, and acting.  This movie proves a spy movie doesn't need a lot of action to be good.  <BR>As the movie starts, agent Ethan Hunt and his team start on a normal mission, when it starts to go terribly wrong.  One by one, his team is killed, and he must find out who killed his team and who set him up.

B000002X4T|5.0|Nostalgia for the late sixties/early seventies having never really abated, if you're wondering what the counterculture was really like, this recording gets a strong recommendation.  A seminal band of the period, Jefferson Airplane was at their creative and performing peak when they recorded this, their finest studio effort.  While the sound is somewhat dated, it stands up far better than the earlier \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\".<br />The themes are those usually associated with San Francisco during this era: getting back to nature (\\"The Farm\\"), the music biz (\\"Song For All Seasons\\"), religion (\\"Good Shepherd\\"), and of course, social revolution.  As the title reflects, this latter theme is dominant on this recording, and is the focus of the strongest material.  Whatever your politics, social revolution is really what rock'n'roll is all about - a changing of the guard from old to new (i.e., young).<br />\\"We Can Be Together\\" is the opening anthem, with its killer acoustic guitar riff and lyrics that capture the spirit of the Woodstock generation as well as any other song in history.  \\"Turn My Life Down\\" is deliciously light and airy thanks to Stills' organ playing, but lacks a strong chorus.  \\"Wooden Ships\\" is a masterpiece, which this reviewer prefers even to the classic CSN version.  \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\" is Grace at her cutting best, and \\"Volunteers\\" shows Balin singing with a relentless passion and conviction that was almost unknown in that era, and has too seldom been heard since.  There are contributions from most of the band members, but only Slick's dark, sexually provocative death march \\"Hey Frederick\\" really misses the mark, at least until the hot little jam at the end.<br />And speaking of jams, what a band they had in those days!  Bassist Jack Cassidy is still fantastic, drummer Spence Dryden was always underrated, guest pianist Nicky Hopkins was among the all-time greats, and guitarist Jorma Kaukonen was dynamite during his brief heyday.  Yet despite a wealth of instrumental skills, the real draw of this band was always the interplay of the careening voices, often not harmonizing so much as cutting across, over and around each other.  There are no lullabies on this album - every track has a definite kick to it, usually in somebody's hind parts.<br />Strictly as a piece of music, four stars would probably be an adequate rating considering the unevenness of some of the material, but this album stands substantially stronger as an historical document.  For those of us old enough to remember, these songs reflect the hope, courage, righteous indignation, and naïve optimism of a period when young people felt ready to tackle America's problems with nothing more than peace, love, and music.  No wonder so many of us long to return to such innocence.

B0000DCGT1|5.0|This will not certainly be a 1,000 word endorsement, but i can honestly say it is one of the best movies i have seen. I think it will go down as a classic.<BR>I have been told that the New England Patriot's all watched this film.  It certainly proved what can happen when people beleive in something and work as a team to prove it.<BR>THIS WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE FOR SEABISCUIT AND THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS<BR>PLEASE GET THIS FILM---YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

It would be a crime not to get this collection of hits!
B00008UZPD|5.0|I've never heard of this movie before until I accidentally read someone's review on another movie. He was wondering why movies like Equilibrium did not get any attention which it deserved. I could not resist my curiosity and thus I rented it right away. What a pleasant surprise! Even if the cover looked like a typical B-class movie, the movie itself was a real deal. Equilibrium is so original and it was not a rip-off of anything as there are some reviews comparing this to the Matrix. I am not saying Equilibrium is better or worse than the Matrix. They are absolutely two different movies and each of them has its own strength as well as weakness.<BR>Although I should say that all those gunfight scenes are not the best I've ever seen, they are very impressive and well executed. I guess in the near future we will see some 'Equilibrium-clone' movies imitating 'Gun-Kata'.<BR>The plot and script are not the first-class but are bearable. The movie delivered its purposes and intentions well, and the character development is convincing and reasonable.<BR>Nevertheless, I can tell you that the acting in this movie was a real killer, totally unexpected. Christian Bale was perfect for his role. I've never seen acting like that in such low-budget, non-theatrical-released movie (well, I read that it was showed at some selected theatres for few weeks).<BR>'Euilibrium' is one of the most underrated movies ever, and it deserves your attention. I really would like to see a sequel with enough budget and better storyline.
B00009W0U4|3.0|A movie with a different approach.<br />The character Alex's name is first mentioned outside of the club. However, what I found most interesting in this movie is that you only begin to get to know the person named Alex AFTER her attack. During the sequences in reverse, almost like flashbacks, you begin to see that Alex is really a sweet and ordinary person, unaware of the tragedy to befall her. But YOU know, because you have already seen it occur. Because of that, you begin to feel even more sympathy for Alex as you begin to get to know her more. What you also realize as the movie progresses backwards is that Alex's assailant will not pay for his crime. Adding more to the viewer frustration. From that aspect, well done.
6305513406|4.0|Well by todays F/X standards this series may seem a little cheesy to a young audience. Those of us that watched it numerous times since it originally aired on TV don't see it that way. Sure we realize there are better effects these days, but better crew interaction? No. Captain Kirk was the tough leader, Spock the intellectual, Bones the well mannered humane doctor, Scotty the engineer who could fix anything. All the rest of the supporting crew were great as well.<br /><br />I challenge anyone to show me a series where they have the comradery of this series. I must admit Stargate SG-1 probally runs a close second, but you can't beat the orginal ST series. Even though we have heard stories that William Shatner did not interact well with several members of the cast, on screen there is no denying his ability as Captain James Tiberius Kirk.<br /><br />This DVD is a must have to start your set. Not to mention it is interesting to note how the costumes, sets, and acting style changes as the crew grew into their parts. It always makes me smile to hear Spock shouting status in the first couple of episodes. Sure I have enjoyed watching all the other Star Trek series, but none more than this set. I bought the entire DVD set even though I do wish they had put more than two episodes and the original TV trailers per DVD. The set has been nicely restored for the DVDs and picture and sound are sharp and clear.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Iffy script, middling performances, totally awesome eighties soundtrack. Also never out of the public eye for a millisecond in the past half year. Always leave them wanting more, not less.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|No other show has hooked me so quickly or surely. It had great acting, writing, action, humor, emotion and special effects. I bought a set for myself and one to loan. Everyone who has seen it has loved it. Buy this set.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|There has never been a series that hooked me as quickly and surely as Firefly. The show had great writing, acting, action, humor, emotion, and  special effects. I recorded every episode that was broadcast. This set is far superior to what was televised. Widescreen is the way it was meant to be seen. I have a set for myself and another to loan out. Everyone I have shown Firefly has loved it. Buy this set.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface is one of those great American classics that make movie watching that much more enjoyable.  It is about a young Cuban (Al Pacino) who finds his way over to America.  After working a dead end, legitimate job he moves onto a more provocative source of income.  Assassination, drug running, murder, theft, and chainsaws await you in this film.  Pacino becomes the biggest importer of cocaine into Miami, and all the quirks of drug-dealing life as we know it through cinema are present.  Romance should be sought out elsewhere.  Phrases such as &quot;Say hello to my little friend&quot; and &quot;Do you think I come over on a boat&quot; make the film catchy.  This is arguably one of Pacino's best works second only to Dog Day Afternoon and the Godfather collection.
B00003CXSP|4.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! You've got this one funny faceless dude riding around in a wheel chair that gets eaten by wild boars. You've got this FBI yankee chick running around pretending to be southern with a dumb accent. You've got this weird cop that hates the yankee chick. Then you have the absolute hilarious Hannibal who runs around and eats people. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. This is really funny stuff. But the greatest most hilarious part is the ending. Hannibal has the weird cop guy all drugged up but he's awake. Hannibal cuts the scalp off of the cop guy and cuts a piece of his brain out and then cooks it and makes the cop guy eat his own brain! HAHAHAHA. Hilarious! Then the cop guy says &quot;MMM, that is good.&quot; I laughed so hard when I watched the cop eat his own brain. I'm laughing about it right now just thinking about it. I gave this movie 4 stars just because it was so funny all the way through. A great comedy movie recommened for comedy fans.

0385510438|2.0|Much of the first half of THE LAST JUROR(set in the early '70s in Ford County, Grisham's Yoknapatawpha)  concerns a murder, and the arrest, trial, and sentencing of one of the members of the local family of criminals with their own private island (every county has one right?). The story is told from the point of view of Willie Traynor, a young northerner who comes into town and buys the struggling local paper for a song, turning it into a fountain of liberalism the Watergate-era Washington post might have trouble keeping up with. <BR> Danny Padgitt, the accused, is sent off to priaon, vowing revenge on the jurors. Much of the second half of the book is devoted to Willie's crusading editorship, opposing Vietnam, exposing political corruption, etc. By the time Padgitt turns up again and people start dying, the town (and the readers) have almost forgotten about him. Instead, we're treated to interminable descriptions of the Southern cooking and homespun wisdom of Miss Callie, a matriarch of the black community whom Willy befriends. The black characters in THE LAST JUROR are one-dimensionally virtuous and could easily be spun off into some sort of Hallmark Hall of Fame movie. More troubling are the female characters, who are either regular churchgoers or slutty, without exception. Susan Sarandon's character from THE CLIENT could have straightened things out in 100 fewer pages. <BR>At least, I thought as I read, THE LAST JUROR lacks the cynicism that pervades Grisham's recent work, but in the end Willie doesn't seem to care about very much, other than the money he might make from selling the paper.
B00006JKOL|3.0|Minstrel in the Gallery: First half has Anderson and his acoustic guitar tunelessly intoning nonsense about &quot;pumpkin-eaters&quot; and various other non-sequiturs, then an instrumental section that sounds like an out-take from &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, then a rock version of Anderson intoning tunelessly the precise same nonsensical lyrics.<br />Cold Wind to Valhalla: Up-tempo minor-key Russian folk song with lyrics that read like those &quot;poetry&quot; refrigerator magnets randomly arranged--except that there seems to be a disproportionate quantity of nouns.<br />Black Satin Dancer: This one had potential. The instrumental section is nice. There is a semblance of melody. Unfortunately, the lyric is obnoxious and Anderson decided for no clear reason to interpolate a rock bit in which he intones tunelessly a fair bit of this same obnoxious lyric.<br />Requiem: Best cut on the album. Reminiscent of the Rolling Stones's &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;. A few strong lines, some purple prose, but too repetitious, and the talking bit strikes me as narcissistic.  <br />One White Duck/0^10= Nothing at All: Two songs run together on a single track, actually. The first is very short and perfectly fine, and the string pizzicato on part of the refrain is more than perfectly fine (unfortunately it only lasts a second or so and only occurs twice). The second is Anderson singing and strumming chords only. It doesn't have a guitar PART; it only has Anderson strumming chords, which makes it sound rather like a demo tape. The song itself has no redeeming qualities. <br />Baker St Muse: Miniature attempt at something like &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; or &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, except individual parts have subtitles (they aren't on separate tracks). Second mini-song has a good start on a melody. Unfortunately it's only a start: the same line is repeated six times, and that's the whole thing. Anderson appears not to know what the word &quot;muse&quot; means, by the way; he appearsto think it means something like &quot;poet&quot;. If he does know what it means, whose muse is he supposed to be? Annoying talking bits, inscrutable lyrics, banal instrumental sections (except that between first and second mini-songs, which is nice).<br />Grace: World's record for shortest song, a tiny nothing.<br />Probably I've made the record sound better than it is, and my three stars are generous.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|\\"Either you get this film or you don't,\\" was the common expression heard during the spring of 2003, and it couldn't be more untrue. The Wachowski Brothers have crafted a science fiction trilogy that far surpasses any of its modern-day counterparts (i.e., Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings). <br />The Matrix Trilogy, as a whole, asks fundamental human questions: \\"Why are we here, and do we have any control over our lives?\\"; \\"Are we completely beholden to the technology we've created?\\" Like a true Zen proposition, and unlike most Hollywood created epic stories, the series mostly doles out the answers in the form of more questions.<br />Neo continues his journey from the tail end of the \\"The Matrix\\", freeing as many minds as possible, but he soon learns that this is not enough. The machines have sent an army to attack Zion, digging from the planet's surface directly into the rebel's home. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and others only have 72 hours to try and stop the onslaught.  And Neo discovers along the way that whatever super-abilities he may have been blessed with as \\"The One\\" are directly superceded by what the audience finds out \\"The One\\" actually is.<br />This film, in ten years time, will be hailed by professional critcs the same as Stanley Kubrick's initally misunderstood masterpiece, \\"2001:  A Space Odyssey\\", was rightfully regaled a decade after its release.
B0000787FH|5.0|&gt;Even Columbia's &quot;Artist...Masterpiece?&quot; ad campaign was begging the question. Was this the album...<br />Sorry, &quot;begging the question&quot; does NOT mean &quot;asking the question&quot; or &quot;provoking the question&quot;; it means assuming in your argument a priori the very thing your argument attempts to prove. &quot;Begging the question&quot; is a logical fallacy, more formally known as &quot;petitio principii&quot;.  <br />In any case, this, in my opinion, is clearly Elvis Costello's best record. I have it on vinyl and don't know the second disc, but I'm very glad the extra things WERE relegated to a second disc (at no extra charge it appears) so that the integrity of the original record was not compromised.
B000001EC1|1.0|This is what happens, auditorally, when you combine guitars with hairspray. And the \\"happening\\" ain't good. This is the ultimate representation of the dreck produced during the 1980's - an era where talent and musicanship took a backseat to appearance and trivialities.<br />If you're reading this, then you need to dig deeper into some of the better musical offerings of the decade; good music could be found, you just had to search a tad harder.<br />Throw out your leftover Aqua-Net and spandex.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A friend asked me what the story in this movie was and, as I tried to tell her I realized how dull it might appear. This movie is very contemplative, it relies a lot on the spectator bonding with the characters, a thing that takes time to achieve. I remember thinking it was a good thing I was seeing this movie it in the theatre, as opposed to DVD/VHS; some parts seemed slow enough to tempt to hit fast-forward. Don't; they are as essential as any other part in that movie; they help relate to the characters on an emotional level that made the movie so incredibly rewarding in the end. I would say that as the two charactes develop their relatiopnship, so does the viewer with them and ultimately with the movie; in the end you might find yourself completely enamored with it.<br />I think this is a movie about many things: interpersonal communication, the feeling of alienation or the need to belong, the relativity of an individual's perceived value according to the circumstances. Had the characters met in LA instead of Tokio, maybe none would have paid attention to the other.<br />In my opinion, \\"Lost in Translation\\" analyzes the most precious type of relationship: simple human affection based on honest communication, no other instincts, biases or interests attached. The story is told in the most delicate, subtle way, the precius style of true cinema.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Many Tolkienites who viewed Peter Jackon's adaptation of The Two Towers could not help but feel somewhat disappointed by the fashion that Jackson strayed from the book concerning the role of Faramir in the hobbits' quest. In the original cut, Faramir comes across as dark, cruel, curt and almost malevolent, a man who then at the end unexplainably lets the captive hobbits go. Of course, in the book Faramir is a noble character, who is only ever-so-briefly tempted by the ring.<BR>The Extended Version shows that Jackson, while still deviating from the book, was attempting to explore the character of Faramir more deeply than even Tolkien bothered to. In extended footage, we see Faramir as a neglected son, desperate to win the confidence and love of his father, and thus tempted to bring the Ring to Gondor in order to &quot;prove his qualities.&quot; A flashback effectively establishes the relationship between Farmir, his now late brother Boromir, and their less than noble father Denethor. Furthermore, an added monologue by Farmir musing over a slain Southron adds a degree of moral ambiguity and reflection to a war story that usually seems to be unabiguously good guy vs. bad.<BR>The extended version also has an important scene developing Frodo's relationship with Gollum. Some critics and movie-goers complained that The Two Towers lacked much of the character interaction that made Fellowship so charming; much of that interaction was edited out in the original cut of Two Towers, but has been edited back in to the Extended Version.
0393037010|5.0|I must confess myself to be among the many new readers of the Aubrey/Maturin books brought to the series by the recent Peter Weir film MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD.  I enjoyed the movie a great deal, and from watching it could easily imagine that the novels, of which I had heard many good things, would be in all likelihood even more rewarding than the movie.  And indeed the first novel, at least, is.  I enjoyed it so much, that I am now moving on to the second novel in the series, POST CAPTAIN, and fully intend to read the rest of the series.  I'm sure virtually everyone knows this, but I'll repeat it for the few who don't, but the movie bears virtually no relation to the novel MASTER AND COMMANDER (apart from lifting two or three minor events and transplanting it to the other story), but is in fact based on a later novel in the series, THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD.<br />Reading this novel brought to mind the changes that have taken place in our understanding of the historical novel over the past century and a half.  In the early nineteenth century, many of the most respected novels were historical, by that meaning that that they were set in an earlier historical epoch.  In these novels, a great premium was not placed on historical accuracy.  In the middle of the 19th century, however, under the influence of Realism in both painting and literature, the historical novel rapidly went out of fashion.  While many of Thackeray's contemporaries considered his THE HISTORY OF HENRY ESMOND, a historical novel set in the reign of Queen Anne, today the novel is only rarely in print.  Many readers of George Eliot considered her ROMOLA, set in late 15th century Florence, to be perhaps her finest work, today it is regarded as one of her least achievements.  The historical has never really regained the standing it once had, and moreover its nature has altered as well.  Today the historical novel is expected to achieve a high degree of historical accuracy.  While a historical novel of 1845 might place character first and then plot (or vice versa), and only after that historical accuracy, the contemporary historical novel is rather the reverse.<br />What sets Patrick O'Brian apart from most other historical novelists is his rare ability to blend astonishing historical detail and accuracy with psychologically fascinating characters.  The plot of MASTER AND COMMANDER is nothing memorable.  It is more a collection of randomly scattered events and incidents.  But the sketching of the characters-especially the main characters of Jack Aubrey, Stephen Maturin, and James Dillon-is unforgettable.  O'Brian is a great educator as well, striving not merely to bring in detail for the sake of impressing the reader with his erudition, but trying to explain why things are done in certain ways.  By the end of the book, one will have a much stronger impression of what life was like on a ship of the British Navy in the early 19th century.  The book also made me want to learn more about sails, kinds of boats, and nautical terms.  I have read Melville and Conrad, but their use of nautical terminology pales beside O'Brian's.<br />Although there is not a great deal of plot in the novel, the interaction between the characters is fascinating.  The most interesting character in the novel is in many ways Lt. James Dillon, who has to hide not only his former involvement in the fight for Irish independence but his Catholicism as well.  My favorite part of the book may have been a long discussion he and Stephen Maturin has, which discloses the common past they both share in the Irish cause, which both of them hides from Capt. Aubrey.  I'm sure this aspect of Maturin's past will be an element in future novels.  As one with only a single novel under my belt, I confess to a great curiosity as to whether Stephen will ever confess to his friend Aubrey, a vehement anti-Papist, his past.<br />If one is looking for a simple adventure story, this might not be a taleto one's liking.  It is heavy on historical detail, rich in psychologically developed characters, but light on plot.  But I personally had a great time reading the book, and very much look forward to reading additional installments in the series.to one's liking.

B00011RPB0|1.0|this has no plot what so ever. it's dull and nothing ever happens in the movie. At the end of the movie my head was ten feet in my sofa. I never want to see this movie again. ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES IH AVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0425170349|2.0|This is no doubt Tom Clancy's worst book. I can't believe he didn't do his homework like in all his other books. And since when do Britons call each other &quot;chaps?&quot; My dad has been to England and said they always address each other as &quot;mates.&quot; I don't know about the plot either. It just sounds a bit silly. How can tree-huggers be so smart and yet so sloppy? The Russian ex-KGB man Popov seemed pretty slick and smart. He was the only convincing character in the book. Ding doesn't strike me as a military man. He seems totally in control on the battlefield and yet, acts like a gangster when interrogating an IRA suspect with a knife. Most of the characters seem so unreal, and since when do terror suspects crack in less than a second under interrogation? And the book is just not reality. In today's world, we can't get even France to stop arguing and look at the big picture. So how can there be a multinational coalition of SWAT people from countries like the US, France and Germany working together? Never going to happen, even if the world is coming to an end. And the ending was so silly and such a letdown. I've read books that ran at 400 pages several times. This is the first 400-page book I've read and felt bitterly disappointed with. Do not even think about reading it. Ironic that there is a huge coalition of military supermen against tree huggers and this book turns out to be a mere waste of paper and money. Try Patriot Games or The Hunt for Red October instead.
B00000JPH6|3.0|Ok... there were a few idiosyncrasies in this movie that really bothered me. First of all... was the idiotic dialogue which ran through the entire movie. The fact that it incorporated very little feeling... and the awful dynamics and pitch and the background dialogue was stupid, a script written for little kids. Then the unbearable decision to have characters constantly making background noises for no reason, except for the fact that they're there.<br />Then you have the irritating movement of the muppet characters themselves... just the heads twisting and flying everywhere... looking completely unrealistic and uncontrollable. But... this movie had some really good traits to it as well.<br />The originality of the storyline was quite enjoyable... as was most of the humor. It has plenty of interesting concepts incorporated into it. I think this movie, if it were redone today, would completely overblow Harry Potter.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is a Mafia obessed geeks dream. I love reading, watching, playing anything related to the Mafia. And these movies, by far, are the greatest Mafia flicks of all time. The first one is my personal favorite of the three. It shows Michael Corleone's rise to the Don of the Corleone crime family. The second one is also great, showing Michael as the Don of the Mafia in Neveda and the eventual destruction of his family. The third one isnt as great but its still a darn good flick. It shows the complete destruction of Michaels life and everything he holds dear. So if your a fan of Mafia flicks go out and buy these.
B00005KHEU|5.0|Yes folks, you heard me. Up too this point, all of my reviews have been 5-star albums (Although, I am waiting for my 3-Star Nirvana review to be posted) - but this, indeed, is the best album ever created (so far). This is first on Mr. Musics Top 5 Favorite Albums. Even number two, Sublimes '40oz. To Freedom' doesn't match up too this. And I will explain why this is so uber brilliant. Technical ecstacy is abundance here. From various electronic shock of a synth, too the mind blowing brilliance of a full-fledged orchestra - this is it. We have electronic synths, Orchestras, Disco beats - all topped off with psychadelic 70's rock on roll. Imagine Kiss playing too the beat of staying alive while the Sanfrancisco Orchestra backs them up. All the tracks here are excelllent, every single one. Not one filler. However, the first four tracks would have to be the best out of them. The first track, 'Shine A Little Love' - has a galloping hard rock riff, and is extremley catchy. Good work by the Orchestra. Confusion has a vintage 70's feel with computer blurts here and there. I Need Your Love is guitarist brilliance, with excellent solos and this is an allaround classic ballad. The Diary of Horace Wimp is interesting power pop. Don't Bring Me Down is the biggest song of here, and although not the best - is still very, very good. But seriously folks, all the tracks are great rock and roll with a bit of disco soul and a electronic orchestra backing. It is all great. Everything. Too bad ELO Really went downhill from here. But this folks has to be the best album to date.
B00004XPP0|5.0|I LOVE STAR WARS. Well the original trilogy at least. I've seen each one about 50 times with the exception of the Empire Strikes Back which I've seen over a 100 times because that movie alone is my favorite of all time. The first one introduces all of the characters, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and Darth Vader. The second flim, The Empire Strikes back is just so great i cant describe it with words. The last flick in the trilogy is Return of the Jedi were the Rebel Alliance over comes the Empire finally. So if you dont already own these movies buy them right now. Any movie fan should own these!
0446604844|2.0|Not all that great. I enjoy this author but this book  had a too much going on and a lot of which was not going in the right direction.<br />For the most part the book was a great read. The character of  Sidney Archer and her story line were my real problem. This lady is smart enough  to know the FBI is following her, but doesn't assume they can tap her phone. She, in deductive reasoning,  concludes her husband has indeed sent her an email... How, Why? That was total bs. The character sees some  mail, magazines, delivered to the wrong place then she thinks the same, versus email. Interesting, She didn't check her own email that way.<br />The next problem was the gun fights. During gun fights you can't really stop and have a conversation. This happens toward the end of the book.   The two FBI agents and Sidney talk, not yell, over the gunfire. It had also been mentioned that all the lights had been shot out, and still, they saw each other. You had HRT members hit, hurt and not once did anyway yell, agent down.<br />Something like this happened prior in the book too. Sidney was fighting the unauthorized  visitor in her house and there was no light, yet, both could see how to fight the other person.  Doesn't add up.<br />That said, I would  give it two stars. These are major draw backs, but if you take out the Sidney Archer character, this all flies well.
0312117337|5.0|This is a beautiful and poignant Tarot Deck.  I received it as a gift several years ago, when I finally dusted it off and started reading through it, it is very easy to learn.  The pictures are beautiful and the cards give full descriptions.  The book is a wonderful teacher, with a little work.  They work well as meditation cards, also.  I have found that there is little interpretation needed as with traditional Tarot Cards.  And every reading has been illuminating and very correct.  I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know this deck.  The book explains things easily and gives explanations on how to solve problems, versus just telling you the problem.
B00008HCCF|5.0|A wonderful DVD capturing Norah's gorgoeus and effortless voice, simple yet elegant band. The camera angles capture her talent on key boards, both a standard Steinway grand and moody Wurlitzer organ.<br />My only demerit is for Norah's unsteady and nervous stage presence which is understandable and almost cute, considering her age and meteoric rise to international stardom.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|The decades of Mr. Murray's acerbic wit and buffonery have masked his talent as a truly engaging dramatic actor...his breathtaking performance is a high-wire act of humor and sorrow...<br />I wont detail the plot and characters as other reviewers have, suffice it to say that this film will take Bill Murray out of AAA ball and into the big leagues of fine actors. Look for meaningful  roles for Mr. Murray soon.  A triumphant, indeed breathtaking performance and reason enough to own the DVD.
0345440900|2.0|I read this book in the first 6 weeks after my baby was born.  I found it to be stress-inducing and condescending.  Unfortunately, I was so emotional and hormonal at the time, I was unable to sift through the book to take what I liked and leave the rest.  I took the book word for word and it increased my stress level and &quot;baby blues&quot; beyond what they had been before because I couldn't get it to work.  Now, 2 months later, I can take the good information and put it to use and leave the rest.  However, I find her approach to be very critical of parents and basically tells us when things go wrong IT'S ALL OUR FAULT!  Thanks, just what stressed-out parents need to hear.  She has a very high opinion of her infant &quot;communication skills&quot; and is very quick to point the finger at families who are having a rough go of it.  Well, show me new parents who DIDN'T have a rough go, it's just part of parenting...especially in the beginning.  I also found parts of the book too vague and slightly contradictory to information in other chapters, especially when it came to sleep solutions which was where I was hoping to find the gold mine.  I found a few nuggets and helpful hints but nothing to make headlines, just common sense.  In summary, take it like anything else in life, if it works for you and your family use it, if not take it with a grain of salt. Nothing works 100% for anyone but remember, it's your family and your baby, don't let a stranger who has never met you make you feel guilty about your own parenting skills.  Being a parent is trial and error, just season your kids with lots of love and someday all the baby trials will be a distant memory.
B00000634B|4.0|Truth be known, there's a few better \\"Stray Cats\\" collections around. But, even though this is only 10 tracks, it does have what's essential. Included is \\"Rock This Town\\", \\"Stray Cat Strut\\", and \\"(She's) Sexy + 17\\", probably their three biggest hits. The other seven on here are all good though, and possibly recognizable even to the casual fan. This is great for the price, but if you need more, check out \\"Greatest Hits\\", or the lengthy \\"Runaway Boys: '81-'92\\".
B0000UHFC6|4.0|The special limited edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; packages the soundtrack to one of 2003's best films -- and a well-deserved nominee for the Best Picture Oscar -- in an elegant and very upscale, yet still very affordable, deluxe package. Bound in green leather, it has a parchment-look pocket inside, containing the CD and a traditional jewel case portion holding a special DVD of the making of the soundtrack and a &quot;supertrailer&quot; for the entire series that's several minutes long.<br />Although the DVD would normally bring this package up to five stars, the soundtrack still isn't quite as good as that for &quot;Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; and I think it'd be disingenuous to give this five stars and imply otherwise. The soundtrack is still excellent, however, as is the performance by Annie Lennox on &quot;Into the West.&quot;<br />Recommended for fans of the LotR movies who want to own a handsome collectable version of the soundtrack.
B000002UVX|5.0|In my years of listening to everything Jimi James has done, I have to rate the last legit humous release as his best.  My reasoning is simple, he was finally surrounded by a musicians that accentuated his playing.  In the Experience, I believe Mitch Mitchell was a more than capable drummer, and live recordings with Jimi and Mitch's interplay support this, but on this album Buddy Miles just fits better.  Buddy's singalongs get a little lengthy at times, but he does have a melodic voice, and he's quite adept at pounding the skins.  The real improvement from this band over the Experience is with the bass player.  Noel Redding basically sucked.  The songs he wrote sucked (Little Miss Strange/whatevers on Axis).  His live playing sucked.  Billy Cox actually heard what Jimi was doing and played with him.  This factor alone makes this album the most enjoyable in the Hendrix catalogue.  Disagree with me if you will, but those are my two cents.  By the way, the Fillmore double album is a real treat.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I am glad that I read several reviews, as one of them indicated that not all of the songs that are actually on the CD are listed. Before I knew that, I was disappointed and would not have purchased this CD because of that. Why would you not list ALL of the titles for the purpose of purchasing this CD. Now that I know that it does include soundtracks from three of the best songs, I will purchase it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is a great album that I still listen too to this day it has amazing songs and Britney sounds amazing in them for those who luv great POP songs or like great music period check this album out!
B0000067L4|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers I scanned, in that this is Cream's weakest effort. However, it's STILL awesome! If you're curious and want to take the time for my input, here 'tis. I grew up a strong Cream fan (saw them twice) and bought all their albums and played them to death in the 60s and 70s. As we all mature (well, most of us), I stopped listening to them (other than the occasional radio play of White Room and Crossroads over the years). OK, so I'm now selling all my old LPs on eBay, as it's just a hassle to play them on the stereo. After listing my 4 Cream albums (Wheels of Fire was clearly the best, then Fresh Cream, Goodbye in last place), I decided to record some of the tunes I liked the most to CD (rather than fork for buying new CDs). I remember how much the live Sitting on Top of the World used to get me off. Actually, the first 6 guitar notes were among my favorite all time musical sounds for years. So, I put it on and IT STILL WORKS!  This album is worth buying just for the live Sitting on Top (as well as Badge). Politian still works great too for a 52-year old grandpa.
B000099T2L|4.0|It was with great trepidation that I approached this CD in the store, after reading lots of scathing reviews.<br /><br />Surprise surprise, it is great. Actually, it shouldn't be a surprise, Beyonc&eacute; has always been super talented.<br /><br />For her debut solo CD, she chose to go a different route from Destiny's child. The deliriously happy and Catchy horn-peppered 'Crazy in love' opens the CD. Fantastic. Next follows the groovy 'Naughty girl' with its sample of Donna Summer's 'Love to love you baby'. The Reggae-ish 'Baby boy' with Sean Paul and 'Hip hop star' with Big boi of Outkast follow, the latter being rock tinged.<br /><br />Next come quite a number of ballads which is where most people have a problem. I don't. 'Be with you' is fantastic, sampling 'Strawberry letter 23' to good effect. 'Yes' and Speechless' are superior and classy ballads which belie her youth. Not the bubble-gum stuff other girls her age are singing. The title track is superb, originally featured on the 'Survivor' CD by her group.<br /><br />The only slight let down to me is the duet with Luther Vandross. I feel it would have been better if performed with, and produced by someone else. She sounded too restrained, as if in awe of Luther's vocals which are not much to write home about here.<br /><br />My copy of the CD is the UK one which has 2 bonus tracks, 'Work it out' from her Austin Powers movie, produced by the Neptunes, and 'Bonnie and Clyde 03' with Jay Z. A great way to close the CD.

6302250269|5.0|Thelma & Louise is a great drama about the lives of two very different women. Released in 1991 under the direction of Ridley Scott.  The movie is approximately 2 hrs and 10 minutes long.  The two main characters in the movie are Susan Sarandon (Louise) and Geena Davis (Thelma).  The movie begins as two women are going on a mini vacation for the weekend, However it turns into a journey of self-realization of their own lives.  Both of these women have been held back by men in one way or another.  The catastrophes are all caused by men and these women react in a way that they couldn't have done if they had stayed in their previous relationships.<br />Thelma and Louise are on an adventure to get away from their lives for the weekend.  In a dramatic turn of events, the girls shoot and kill a man, rob a store, practice infidelity, blow up a truck, and discover a part of themselves in the adventure. The tragedy is, while the events that happened while on this trip were justified and morally understandable, they did break the law. The women run because they are scared of being punished without any understanding of their side of the story because these women have never been right when a man was involved in a situation.  Thelma & Louise stick together through the whole ordeal until the very end.<br />I give this movie  * * * * * stars.  The ideals in this movie were great.  It showed determination, self-discovery, and true friendship.  This movie could make you believe something like this could happen, the events in the movie do take place in everyday life.  These women could have stopped and explained their actions at any time, but they didn't because they were choosing their own path and doing what felt right to them.

B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam was at the end of their long contract with Sony and instead of giving its' dedicated corp of fans a rehashed \\"BEST OF\\" disc that 9 out of 10 artists would do, they gave us many rare, mostly unheard songs that did not make any of their previous albums.    Additionally, if that were not enough, knowing that fans have a bunch of these songs from b-sides on previous singles, they release new, different recordings of many of those songs!  This is a generous gift from PJ to their fans.  They don't take their fans for granted and give them their money's worth.  Every single time!    As for Lost Dogs, this works like two albums - one hard, another soft - both interesting and with many surprising great songs.  The best tracks - \\"Fatal\\", \\"Sad\\" and the amazing (hidden-all these years) \\"Hold On\\".  For years PJ fans have not heard such an early, youthful anger and emotion from the band.  This was the greatest gift on this album.  I thought I'd never hear that sound again from them and they dig out an unheard gem that belonged on either the Ten or Versus albums.  It is heartbreaking.    Other great tracks include \\"Hard to Imagine\\", \\"Black, Red and Yellow\\", \\"Leaving Here\\", and of course, \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\"      This is a great disc for those of you who haven't heard PJ since their early-mid ninties days.  It covers their entire career.  A great gift!  Thank you Pearl Jam!
078322608X|1.0|Absolutely one of the worst movies ever made in any genre. The &quot;plot&quot; verges on incomprehensibility, which is actually OK since you do not know and do not care for any of the characters.<br />The phrase &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; actually appears to apply to the people who wrote and directed this stinker.
B00005JME0|5.0|After reading reviews about how some scenes are shown multiple times, I thought this movie might get boring halfway through, but it doesn't. The repeated scenes are often emotionally intense; so the pace remains excellent for those who don't mind movies with violence, foul language, and other socially unacceptable behaviors. This film is definitely NOT for children. The movie has a slightly sci-fi/horror based nature to it, so this movie isn't for those who need every last detail to be 100% realistic. The main theme of the movie seems to be that life is about trade-offs. It's like playing rock-paper-scissors. Even if one could change the past, there is a weakness associated with every choice. As a result, the main character eventually learns that truly loving a girl requires being socially responsible in both his family life and her family life, but this means sacrificing his perfect fantasy...
B00006C79E|4.0|I have been a fan of Saint Etienne since stumbling on Foxbase Alpha in 1991. I love the quirky, all-too-British sound. It was a true and refreshing alternative to the direction music took in the States, e.g. Nirvana. THIS band truly smells like teen spirit and isn't ashamed. So Tough is my favorite album, but I have had Finisterre for a few days now and I think that it's a close second. It's got some great tunes, folks. I must confess that I'm addicted to &quot;Shower Scene&quot; and I only wish that I still went out to clubs just so I could go out and dance to this song with a frenzied mob.  Anyway, back to the album...<br />Some here have complained about &quot;Soft Like Me,&quot; and I think it's probably the weakest track on the CD.  It just barely fits. Go check out Saint Etienne dot com to hear some longer samples of all the tracks on Finisterre as well as be entertained by an awesome Flash-based website with a talking tube map (be sure to roll over all the stations!). This album might not serve as a great introduction to the uninitiated, but for the fan it is classic Etienne. Supposedly there was a documentary film made with the same title!?! Will we ever see it released on DVD? Hope so! Thanks Sarah, Pete, and Bob for a job well done.
B000001Y79|4.0|Released all the way back in 1995, this album went on to sell over 20 million copies worldwide (over 15 million in the US alone). This CD includes the hits Just a Girl, Spiderwebs, Don't Speak, Excuse Me Mr., and Sunday Morning.<br />The album opens with 1. Spiderwebs (5/5) This song is pretty much instantly catchy, and if your a person who likes to bang your head around, the chorus is perfect for that.  2. Excuse Me Mr. (4/5) This song is a pretty hardcore, in-your-face kinda song. It's probably the worst of their single releases from this album, but it's still really good. 3. Just a Girl (5/5) Now this is THE song that put No Doubt on the map. It's a girl anthem, but unlike alot of them, it isn't a man hating one! It opens with that famous, catchy guitar riff, and the song just goes from there. 4. Happy Now (4/5) I think it's pretty obvious that this song is about Gwen and Tony's break-up, but, it's not a bad song. It's pretty catchy to. 5. Different People (3/5). Another catchy song, about people being, well... different... It seems like a bit of a filler, but it's still an okay song. 6. Hey You (4/5) Lol, the chorus is kinda weird (\\"Your just like my Ken and Barbie doll\\"), but weird in a good way. The song is catchy, and I love the way they use the Sitar. 7. The Climb (4/5) Definitely the longest song on the album, topping the 6 minute mark. The only thing that keeps this song from reaching 5 stars, is the fact it seems to drag. Other than that, it's a great song.<br />8. Sixteen (5/5) One of my favorite songs not to be released from this album. It's really catchy, and has a great chorus. Great song. 9. Sunday Morning (5/5) I think this is one of No Doubt's most underrated songs. The big long drum roll at the beginning is great. Everything about this song is great. And, it's so damn catchy. 10. Don't Speak (5/5) My favorite song off of this album, and maybe my favorite No Doubt song ever. I mean, who hasn't heard this song. It's one of the most beautiful break-up ballads of all time. This song shot straight to #1, and became No Doubt's biggest single ever. Gwen sounds so heartbroken in this song, it gives me chills. Believe me, if you listen to this song when your sad, you might just cry. 11. You Can Do It (3/5) Another song that seems like a filler, and is probably the worst song off of the album. It's not a terrible song mind you, and is pretty catchy. 12. World Go 'Round (5/5) This is my other favorite song not to be released off of this album. Everything sounds great on this song, and it's so catchy. 14. End It on This (4/5) This is pretty good song. Another song that is most likely about Gwen and Tony's break-up. It seems to drag a bit at the end though. And finally, 15. Tragic Kingdom (4/5) I think this song is the perfect way to end the album. It's a good song, but it can be kind of confusing. It drags a bit at the end to.<br />All in all, this album is great. I recommend if you're looking to become a fan of No Doubt's music, you start with this album. But, if you only like a few of their songs, I'd recommend buying The Singles 1992-2003.up ballads of all time. This song shot straight to #1, and became No Doubt's biggest single ever. Gwen sounds so heartbroken in this song, it gives me chills. Believe me, if you listen to this song when your sad, you might just cry. 11.

0385504209|1.0|All I can say after this reading is...BLAH! I am truly shocked that SO many people liked this book. Maybe it's because so many had never heard of any of the concepts Brown introduces. I think he's one of those know it all sort of people who has a definite agenda to push. For this guy, it's goddess worship. Read any interview of him regarding this novel and you will know the truth of my words.<br />If you must read it, please don't waste your money- borrow it from your public library.
B00013PHGS|4.0|A friend at work recommended the group to me...and I popped it into yahoo radio and it spit out Cherry Blossom Girl within minutes.  Nice!  After that, I was reasonably sure I wanted to get the CD, so I checked out Itunes.  No dice.  My partner surprised me and got a copy in the city, and I've been listening to it in the car for the past week.  Don't think I've been disappointed by any of the songs.  <br />For those, like me, who hadn't heard Air before, it's kinda like a male form of Enya...meaning it's slow and pleasant to listen to, with a modern enough beat and cadence to be a good CD for a drive.  It's kept me awake on drives home from midnight shift...42 mile commute for me...which Enya could never do.  All in all, it's worth the purchase.
B00006JKOL|5.0|..... how great this Album really is.<br />I know ALL Tull Albums and i think, this is the best and most delicius one. Delicate string work, very heavy guitar playing, fleetest fingering on the acoustic guitar and fa´ntastic songs.<br />I don't know why so many fools just don't like this example for the best music a human brain can create. <br />Probably the most unplugged sounding Album, but still belonging to the Heavy Rock / Prog Rock genre, well balanced between epic Heavyness (Black Satin Dancer, Cold Wind to Vallhalla), acoustic ballads (One white duck, Requiem) and both (Title Track, Baker St Muse), the album is a fantastic showcase for Andersons talents, his voice never sounded better, his acoustic guitar playing is amazing, as well as his flute playing. Don't pay any attention to those who don't like the album. They are not able to understand the genius behind the songs. <br />Sit back, relax, put your feet up to enjoy the best and most virtous Tull Album!
B000084T18|1.0|they have nothing really in common other than the fact they both rap and are under 35.  At least Eminem is amusing and/or has a message.  &quot;Four bits&quot; doesn't even have that.  If this is what is popular rap nowadays, than maybe there will be a new artist to sweep 50 cent and Ludacris away in the next few weeks.  We can only hope.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series had everything that the perfect show should have.  It had fine, taut writing.  The characters were well-crafted, diverse, and multidimensional.  The setting was a weird combination of the Old West, Far East, and outer space, and in spite of how that sounds, it worked unbelievably well.  The dialogue was typical Joss Whedon - snappy, at times dark, and at times funny.  This show should still be airing everywhere, but in typical Fox Network fashion, they killed it with no more regard for it than a teenager has for an infant she stuffs into a dumpster during her Senior Prom.  Harsh words, perhaps, but pretty accurate if you happened to watch this masterful production for the few weeks it aired, only to see it taken off the air and replaced with &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Oliver Beene&quot;, &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, and assorted other dreck and drivel that Fox now makes and airs by the boatload...<br />Anyway, the DVDs have all the episodes that aired, plus three that were in the can but never aired.  Even better, the episodes were put on DVD in the sequence that should have been aired, not the botched-up hatchet-job sequence that the Fox Morons used.  The 28-minute &quot;Making Of...&quot; featurette had a bittersweet quality to it, as evidenced by overt feelings of love for their product that the cast and crew showed.  I didn't listen to the audio commentaries because I find that they divert attention from the actual episodes.<br />Well, all I can say is this...  If you are checking out this page, then blow the lock off your wallet, and order this DVD set.  Hell, order two in case you damage one set.<br />If you are a Reality TV show watcher, save your money, and go back to watching the glorified test paterns you have grown accustomed to.  If you like interesting TV shows with heart, fun, darkness, and the whole gamut of human emotions, then definitely buy this set.  'Nuff said :-)
B000002UA9|1.0|I bought this with the expectation that it will have good Rock n Roll on it. It doesnt. Get &quot;Elvis- The Complete 50s Masters&quot; for the greatest Rock n Roll that was ever recorded. The Beatles are a poor imitation of what real Rock music is.
0887306101|5.0|If you are interested in philosophy you read about the great philosophers, if you are interested in coaching sports read about the methods of great coaches, and if you are interested in financial market success, you should read market wizards. The author of this book has done all traders and investors an extremely valuable service by interviewing some of the best speculators of our time. This book is really a collection of wisdom from people who at the time this book was written, had extraordinary results in the financial markets. While the traders interviewed in Market Wizards do not reveal some &quot;holy grail&quot; trading strategy for making millions, there are many speculation related philosophical insights that should certainly point you towards a proper frame of thinking about what it takes to trade succesfuly. Some of the basic insight common to all traders interviewed in this book are: Cut your losses short, let your profits run, The value of patiently waiting for the right trading opportunity, personal discipline, getting your ego out of trading decisions, and many more. This is not the type of book you read only once. To become a successful market speculator, one must have a sound trading philosphy, a valid technique, and most importanlty the discipline to implement it. I believe market wizards, allows you to read about many different individuals who each have a valid trading philosophy, a valid method, and the discipline to execute. While one cannot expect to become a market wizard simply by reading a book about them, I believe one will certainly point themselves in the right direction of achieving the goal of understanding what it will take to succeed in the financial markets by reading this book.
0440180295|5.0|I will not sit here for an hour and give you every detail of the book. No, infact I will say that this book is well writen, has a wonderful charm and is filled with such a funny story line. Nothing you will be laughing aloud to. Please read and enjoy.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is getting alot of crap it seems like, and I think it is really stupid.  They are a great band from my home state, and they deserve the..what?...like around three or four grammy nominations? They won two grammies! They can't be that bad after all. David Hodges (the co-writer of all the songs) went to my school.  Great people, great band, great cd.
B0001906O0|5.0|With Robert Smith hacking away at previously released material Ie:Galore , Staring at the sea and most recently the double release Greatest hits,Its a wonder this disc set didnt come out sooner - many completist and long time fans have almost all of this material already. The box set is not as complete as the average person might be led to believe though... It is still missing many early tracks including the long sought after first single Cult Hero as well as Forever which appeared on many bootlegs and early recordings. Also if you were to have purchased the live cassette which side A contained the concert Side B was an array of outakes and B sides which included a live release of Forever as well as Heroin face with a mass array of others. Another missing track is Side B to the Faith cassette which was a 20+ minute instrumental that drones a little but was actually a sountrack to a short movie the band had played before them going on stage. These are stand out tracks that should have been included as a bonus disc on this box set. With that bieng said I will go into the actual review of the content of the box set itself. I will also try and point out what is nice to be added to the box set and what is sadly left off when needed.<BR>Going through disc one it opens with a few of the original songs that later were re-done and made to be on the U.S. version of the release Boys dont cry. The remaining songs on disc one is Side B to the Staring at the sea cassette which formed a nice compilation from all of the bsides that coincided with side A of Staring at the sea. I was extremly exited to see these were finally available for the first time on cd.<BR>Disc 2 goes into the Kiss me stages of the discog. Tracks 2-9 all are from the singles. The only one I am sure of is the single for Catch featured Breathe and Chain of flowers on it. Again they didnt use all the Bsides because you could make a box set in just the remixes featured on every single as well. Again tracks 2-9 falls under the same assumption that we are all rejoicing to have these on cd quality instead of the cassettes that wear out and vinyl that has been played to skips and scratches. Track 9 is a song that many Cure fans tried like hell to get in the early 90's and mostly in vain - to finally have To the sky on an official release and not a bootleg was eneough to win me on this box set! Picking up on track 10 is where The Cure really started getting noticed for how wonderful the Bsides they were doing really was - I had went out and bought EVERY single I could find from the Disintigration cd (and wish as it came out) but more on that later...  Babble and out of mind both were from the first single I ever bought which was the Fascination st. single. They both seer with intensity.  Fear of Ghosts is perhaps one of the greatest songs the band ever did and sadly it was mostly overlooked. Hello I love you appeared on the Rubyat compilation and the remainder of the cd plays out other bsides from the Disintigration era.<BR>Disc 3 I feel has the most commercial appeal and probably success that the band ever achieved. Wish was a huge seller for them as well as singles for High , Friday im in love and Letter to elise spawning some amazing bside tracks,the box set missed a few vinyl singles sadly. There is a demo style mix of Open on a rare clear vinyl 12&quot; for High that sounds better then the original as well as a few misc. ones on others. The mix of Open should not have been left off this compilation. For the 3rd disc though. Opening with This Twilight garden could not have been a better choice! This is quite possibly the bands most beautiful ballad , both musicly and lyricly Robert has never been more poetic. Going all the way to track 7 it follows the singles that came out for Wish. Moving onto track 8 we have the cover of Purple Haze that appeared on the Stone Free release that was a tribute to Hendrix then moving through track 12 we go to the songs they did for the moviesThe Crow &amp; Judge Dredd as well as his cover of Bowies Young Americans. Then it went into a few songs from Wild Mood Swings to round out disc 3 - I still stand on disc 3 bieng the most solid of the 4 discs that appear on the box set.<BR>Disc 4 moves into ending out the disc so the singles are a bit slower - the more powerful songs from Wild Mood swings ended the disc off nicely which flows through track 6. Then you have a few tracks from tribute releases then the bsides from the Greatest Hits single as well as some remixes. Disc 4 was really the weakest disc on the box set. Many of the remixes at the end could have been left off to be included on a seperate box set and leave it to add in what songs I said that were left off. Regardless of what is missing on the release , without owning about 40+ Cure related releases , there is no other way to own all the wonderful songs included on the box set. If you like The Cure then you need this box set. It is one of the most complete that I have ever seen any band do and thats including what flaws that the release has and well worth the money.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I have to admit that I'm as macho as the next guy. I like action movies, sci-fi and comedy. When I first heard of Gilmore Girls I just wrote it off as another show that I would skip. That is until I actually saw an episode. That one episode opened my eyes and forced me to expand my definition of quality television. I have never encounted a show whose dialogue was so SHARP and yet managed to stay so close to how real people would react. The charecters, both main and in the background, are memorable and unique. And I will say to anyone who asks, whoever made the decision to cast the parts of Rory and Lorilei were absolutely brilliant. The chemistry between the two just takes your breath away. It blows my mind that I have to keep reminding myself that they are not mother and daughter in real life. I think what ultimately draws me as a viewer is that way it perfectly mixes sharp dialogue, drama, humor, and most of all the way it shows not just whats going on on the surface of a person but underneath as well. I still proudly call myself a guy. Its just that now guys who are into quality television have Gilmore Girls to add to their list as well
B0000AMRJC|5.0|There has never been a single movie that has influenced an entire culture like \\"Scarface\\" has. 'Gangsta rap', 'thug life', 'bling-bling', 'big pimpin', you name it. It all comes from this critically maligned (at the time) cult classic 'reimagining' of the 1932 original.<BR>All these gangster rappers want to be the embodiment of Tony Montana. Their aspirations (get the money, get the [women], get paid) are all tied into this fictional character who just happens to meet a violent end.<BR>And this is an awful shame. ...It's just a stupid movie. Not worth getting 'capped' over this. And no matter how many negative reviews I get, I AM NOT CHANGING MY MIND! This is a darn fine movie by the way. The chainsaw scene is great.
B00008EYA5|1.0|Since Samuel L Jackson was in this film I gave it a chance. My mistake.<br />I want the 117 minutes of my life back that I wasted on this film.<br />I guess I can't get that refund I did watch the whole thing. But I kept thinking this will get better and it never does.<br />Almost none existant plot, silly action scenes.<br />I would never recommend this to anyone.<br />If you think I'm off the mark, look at how many used copies of this dvd are for sale, and the low price they are going for. Good movies hold their value.<br />If you have to see this thing rent it, cut your losses.
B000067CPX|5.0|I love this album. It's great for lonesome car rides in the middle of the night. Songs like \\"This Is the Place\\" \\"Don't Forget Me\\" \\"Tear\\" \\"Midnight\\" \\"On Mercury\\" \\"Minor Thing\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" and others make this CD more than worth your money.<br />It would be hard to be dissapointed by By The Way. Unless you were expecting another Blood Sugar Sex Majik or Californication, which this CD is not.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Vampires fighting werewolves, and Kate Beckinsale in leather, are the twin promises of \\"Underworld\\", and you'll probably be happy if your expectations are no higher than that.  To be fair, the lavish digital imagery suggested by the trailer is deployed with impressive restraint, and the film is distinguished from most other effects-intensive offerings by its determination to tell a story.  The problem is that the story it chooses to tell is convoluted, unmotivated and, in the end, not a particularly thrilling one.  What starts as a promising detective-tale-with-love-interest collapses under the weight of its own backstory and the apparent need to lay the ground work for a sequel. A tale of night-stalking monsters, blood disorders and forbidden love is surely ripe for a psycho-sexual subtext, but Danny McBride's screenplay seems content to make a few passing references to black slavery and leave it at that.  He was clearly more concerned with writing chase sequences involving a variety of expensive vehicles and cramming in enough \\"acting\\" roles for all his old stuntman buddies.  As director, Len Wiseman's adman pedigree is far too obvious.  He delivers one or two interesting shots, but generally relies on an aesthetic owing too much to rock videos, computer games and \\"The Matrix\\" ever to be truly engaging in its own right.  Still, the whole package shows enough promise to keep me interested in what these guys do next.  On a budget of $23 million, they've delivered a lot of movie for the money.
B00012QKSI|5.0|If you've seen the movie... you gotta have this CD.  It soon will become a classic.
B000003TB6|5.0|Obviuosly I got this album like 8 years after it was released but I can't live without writing about this classic Roots Project.  I've seen The Roots play live and it was an experience I'll never forget.  However, this album took a while to grow on me.  After one night of heavy concentration and patients it was evident that this album is amazing and so are the roots. The thing that I love about this album and the roots is that they are so different compared to the other hip hop acts.  Not only are they well spoken; not concerned about cars, jewelery, and guns, they play live instruments with rarely any sampling involved.  My favorite tracks on the cd are &quot;Mellow My Man&quot;, which is just fly, &quot;Datskat&quot;, &quot;Lazy Afternnon&quot; all 3 verses are the same but it's an interesting concept, &quot;Do YOu Want More&quot; the titled track, &quot; What Goes on Pt. 7&quot;, Silent Treatment&quot;.  I also enjoy listening to &quot;? vs. Rahzel&quot;.  THough the Roots band members have changed such as Malik B. departing, ?uestlove, Black Thought, Dj Scratch, Hub are a forced to be reckened with.  The thing that I like about this cd is that it is very creative, innovative, nd jazz originated.  I just laugh when my my friends ask me whos's in my cd player at the time and when I say the Roots they give me a weird look.  I guess they're just brainwashed with this stupid 50 Cent and Cash Money Millionaire madness.  They really missing out.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This has to have been one of the worst movies I have yet to suffer through.  Zero plot.  The attempt to portray two lost (pun intended) individuals searching for meaning in their lives falls far short, resulting instead in a tiresome and altogether disjointed film.  Finally, the movie's portrayal of Tokyo life must have left travel agents fuming.
B00005JME0|5.0|As a boy Kutcher has a series of blackouts that occur during stressful or dangerous points in his life.  As he ages the memories begin to return and he also finds a way to relive those experiences and change hem.  The chaos theory claims that a butterfly's wing beating in Beijing can cause a typhoon in the Atlantic.  As he changes one little thing from his past, it causes a chain of events to big for him to handle.  I thought this movie was pretty good it kept you guessing a lot of the time.  It seemed like anything that could have went wrong did.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes suspenseful and kind of eerie movies.
0688163173|2.0|This is the second Lehane I read, it was ok and a fast read but it seemed again that little details are wrong.  For instance I don't believe people generally bought coffee at newstands in 1950's.  The idea of people walking around drinking coffee is kind of new.  I went to college in boston &amp; worked in town in the late 60's and that wasn't typical then even (I'm addicted to coffee so I'd remember).  Also he made it seem like those harbor islands are remote and inaccessible.  There are little islands all over the place and not too far away from each other.  I also wasn't surprised.  I will read Mystic River before I see the movie however.
B00011D1OA|5.0|This 50th Anniversary edition of the 1964 Oscar winner, MY FAIR LADY is worth every penny!  A great film deserves to be made into a special edition DVD like this classic!  The film looks great after its extensive HD restoration .  The extras include that wonderful documentary about the restoration of this classic as well as LOTS of trailers and theatrical shorts including one dealing with the beautiful costumes by the late Cecil Beaton. CBS Home Entertainment and Robert Harris went all out for this one. Kudos to them!    I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS SPECIAL EDITION TO ALL MY FAIR LADY/AUDREY HEPBURN FANS OUT THERE!
0393325172|5.0|Having sailed a tall ship, scuttled around like a spider in her shrouds, scrubbed her decks and promoted Navigator, Master and Commander does an exemplary job in recreating the tense atmosphere of adventure in the Napoleonic wars. With a voyage and brig secured, Jack Aubrey, accompanied by his friend Stephen Maturin, does his duty in commanding the little brig HMS Sophie and her crew for England to capture other ships of the French fleet and take them as prize. <br />Set in the wet waters of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean, the inseparable pair Aubrey and Maturin sail their way through many eye-opening encounters. It is O'Brian's beauteous prose and characterisations that seize the reader's imagination - allowing him to delve into the world itself and actively take part in it. By elegantly combining nautical terms of the Enlightenment thinker and descriptions of feelings and the environment like a Romantic, O'Brian creates a pleasantly-paced plot which give readers an unquenchable thirst for more. <br />The language is formal and most proper, littered with delectable nautical terms (depending on your naval background). This may be a crucial factor in determining whether this read will be one of success or not. Therefore it is only highly recommended to those with even a dollop of sailing lingo. Only then is it possible to relive the delight of going aloft to furl the forecourse; with Maturin the ship's surgeon to learn of the knuts and bolts of the brig.<br />Therefore I would highly recommend this book to all adventurous souls who delight in sailing or history. The fact that there are twenty books in the Aubrey/Maturin series makes it even more of a treasure. Life is all about experiences, and what more could you wish for than to dive into the world of a man-of-war while riding the bus? Especially when O'Brian's world of 18th century sailing is fading.

The suspense is intense and the setting is another great tribute as with A Time to Kill, set in Mississippi.  Don't miss this one. Grisham fans will love it, and if you're new to John Grisham, you will be hooked!
B00009M6VJ|1.0|This movie was far too contrived and unoriginal to make it even a midly interesting viewing.  Kevin Spacey was not in his top form in this movie, and combined with the horrible plotting and pacing the movie is a near-catastrophe.  Unless you are a hardcore Spacey or Winslet fan, I would avoid viewing this film.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When i first heard the cd, i admit, i thought it was a little boring and i hated the single, &quot;cochise&quot;...I was the worst critic of audioslave and remember telling all my friends how bad the cd was and how it sounded the same throughout....I loved Rage and this cd didn't have the great guitar solos by tom morello like all the rage cd's had or the unique political rap/rock lyrics of zack de la rocha.  Also, it really didn't sound anything like rage at all.  Finally, since <BR>I never really got into Soundgarden, I wasn't too big a Chris Cornell fan.<br />Then, after putting the cd away for maybe 4 months, i revisited it while on a long drive (about 8 hours).  Wow! it was like someone had completely changed the entire cd and made it sound better.  I think I just grew into liking audioslave after really listening a couple of times.  I did a complete 180 and told all my friends how wrong i was and how great this cd really is.  <br />My favorite songs are primarily the slower ones:  &quot;Like a stone&quot;, &quot;I am the highway&quot;, &quot;shadow on the sun&quot;, and &quot;the last remaining light&quot;....although i also like every other song on the cd.  If you have heard a single or two and aren't convinced how great this cd is, just buy it and listen closely 2 times through...you'll be amazed; there are no bad songs, you don't have to skip a single track and it flows so well w/o sounding redundant.<br />I also saw the band live at a concert this summer and was amazed at how well the band played (sounding MUCH better than i remember Rage against the machine being when i saw them in '98)... to top it off, Morello included several unique sounding solos.<br />Anyway, this is one of the top 5 cd's i've bought in the last 3 years....easily 5 stars.<br />The only suggestion is to include a couple more Morello solos on the next cd and maybe add a track or two with guest vocals (like Maynard James Keenan from Tool/A Perfect Circle, Aaron Lewis of Staind, or EddieVedder of Pearl Jam)...that would be awesome.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|In the middle of watching this DVD, I put it on &quot;pause&quot; and went to take a shower and cook my dinner. Not a good recommendation ...and yet I certainly cannot say that I didn't like it, or even greatly admire the skilled photography and, yes, direction. I'm just not sure I get the point.<br />Bill Murray plays a disaffected American actor who comes to Japan to make a $2 million commercial touting a Japanese brand of whiskey. Oh no, Bill has sold out. His angst tells the tale as he suffers through the shoot and then through a number of publicity stills destined to make the sides of buses throughout Tokyo. In the middle of this he meets an equally disaffected young wife (Scarlett Johansson)who is in Japan accompanying her photgrapher husband. We know she is unhappy because she spends at least half her time sitting on the window ledge in her hotel room, looking out at the scenery.<br />Bill and Scarlett meet. They share their angst and their snide humor, mostly aimed at the Japanese. They also bond and have some fun. Story drags on.<br />I do see why Sofia Coppola has been rewarded for her superb direction; there are no superfluous scenes, everything is flawless, Tokyo is shown at its best and is skillfully used as anoter major character in the film.<br />Watching the extra material, however, is painful, at least for me. We have a long long long look at pre-production and the early days of shooting, where we meet much of the senior crew on the film. We have a mediocre video. We DO, however, get to see more of a hilarious, funky Japanese TV show, upon which Bill Murray guests in the film. That's almost worth the price of the DVD. I did not watch the deleted scenes or the interview with Bill and Sofia--I had seen enough of each of them on the pre-production segment, and I didn't want the memory of deleted scenes to spoil my pleasure in the editing of the film itself.<br />Enough said. I would probably have given this film three and a half stars if there was such a thing; it's worth seeing, but not a masterpiece.a thing; it's worth seeing, but not a masterpiece.
B000006TRV|5.0|I just recently started listening to Pink Floyd.  I had already heard songs like wish you were here and another brick in the wall part 2 on the radio, but I never knew just how awesome Pink Floyd was until i heard shine on you crazy diamond.  I am now hooked!  I own wish you were here, dark side of the moon, and the wall.  I think these albums are brilliant and I have never heard anything like them!  I can't get enough of Pink Floyd.  It makes me mad when people say that nobody listens to them anymore except old people...that is NOT true.  There are plenty of people my age that listen to Pink Floyd.  I really recommend this album and any other Floyd album for that matter because they truly ROCK!
0385504209|4.0|This one kept me going as few others have of late.  A very unexpected pleasure to read.
B00005JKO9|4.0|This was a well conceived, well researched and very well produced film. The script was excellent and a cast of first rate actors gave outstanding performances. Warren Beatty's direction was flawless and he received the only Oscar for this film. Instead of Chariots of Fire, an entertaining production, this film should have received the Oscar that year. I have seen it three times, read the books it was based on, and would love to own this film on DVD.
0060090383|4.0|This book is very powerful. It tells the tale of Rachel, a drug addict in denial, who has destroyed her life and the lives of those around her.  She is forced to seek help after an accidental overdose puts her in the hospital. From there, the book chronicles her very painful and slow path to recovery. Along the journey, you are introduced to many interesting people and colorful events that take place. As I read this book, I experienced the same emotions and feelings Rachel had: anger, fear, denial, shame, caution, compassion, hope and happiness. I think this is an incredibly well written book packed full of characters that you can identify with. It is obvious the author did plenty of research on the subject of addiction. This is the best story for addiction and recovery that I have ever read due to the feelings and accuracy that the author captures. <br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not find this book to be incredibly funny. There were amusing parts, but I seemed to gain more from the emotional journey of Rachel's recovery than from the humorous aspects of the story.
0385504209|2.0|It seems as though there are no middle of the road reviews on Dan Brown's DaVinci's Code.  Either they are wildly euthusiastic or a complete pan.  The story's premise has an interesting hook that grabs almost anyone (Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene) but, delivers it with such lameness that the reader becomes annoyed.  Not even the fast facts nor the historical trivia can keep you from noticing the all too convenient discoveries and formula type writing.  For example the multiple uses of the second look at any situation yielding much more information than the first.  I would imagine this is to create suspense or intrique.  It accomplishes nothing when used twenty times in the book.  We end up wishing the main characters would purchase a pair of dime store bifocals to see what is patently obvious to the reader.  All in all I was left on completion of the book with the feeling of how good it could have been.
B000084T18|5.0|50's the best rapper out right now, he's been around for awhile on mixtapes, now he's mainstream, this is a classic, expect more
B0000028SR|3.0|This goes to the first review - he could play it safe by combining the best tracks from the two 1992 albums. He couldn't. The albums have a very different focus and concept, a different story. While HT contains some of the maudlinest Springsteen songs, Lucky Town grabs his just-married inner self perfectly with songs like Book Of Dreams, If I Should Fall Behind, Better Days, My Beautiful Reward (which sounds much better live - see MTV Plugged). And there's that link, a special link that binds the 'Springsteen novel' on every album - Big Muddy does it on the LT album. HT can't seem to make a special link, tho', or maybe it does after all, with I Wish I Were Blind.<BR>The two songs I like best on this HT album are Wish I Were Blind and Pony Boy. Yes, Pony Boy. 57 Channels shows Bruce's comical side. It's a pleasure to listen to. As far as other songs here go, I can't say that much. They're pretty much a deja vu, only that he did it better before. But anyway, the album is a statement. A statement of a lightweight Springsteen who rocks out hard and celebrates his newfound emotional stability with a bit of fear whether it could last (With Every Wish, Gloria's Eyes, Wish I Were Blind). Ain't it an interesting contradiction?
6305508550|5.0|This movie falls into my top 5 movies of all time list. Nothing in the category gets close to beating it.
B0000CC5CS|3.0|This is a movie that simply past it's prime. It's a movie that should have been made long ago and today simply capitalizes on the previous success of the series and plenty of action and special effects to bring in crowds.<br />First of all the movie was NOT made by James Cameron (the creator and director of the other 2 terminator movies). This is the main reason why T3 is so bad in comparison to the other movies. There is no hint of Camerons style. T2 in particular had a distinct &quot;feel&quot; to the movie - a blend of action, mild humor, and an epic theme that melded together into a style that just worked well. T3 without cameron is like a child without a father and suffers from this in a very apparent way as can be seen in it's flawed delivery.<br />The plot has arnold returning as a reprogramed terminator on a mission to defend John Conner (once again) from death at the hands of an even deadlier terminator - the female TX. We learn that judgment day was not stopped by the events of the last movie (big shock), only posponed. The mission now is not to stop judgment day, but to survive it. The addition of connor's future wife and 2nd in command into the plot is intriguing, yet with the exception of a few moments, this was never expanded upon in the movie as much as it could have been.<br />The TX is even more advanced than the T1000 of T2, and sports some nifty nano technology that lets her control other machines as well as morph her physical form into complex weapons - a logical progression from the last &quot;new&quot; teminator bad guy. This lends itself to an abundant amount of cool special effects, although some of the effects are a bit too flashy and feel like the sort of CGI you'd expect from an intro sequence to a video game. The fights between arnold and the TX are pretty hard hitting, with some good action sequences... it's great when they bust each other up, though this is a little over used throughout the entirety of T3.<br />At the bottom of my frustration with this movie is that the whole scenario of 2 terminators sent back in time feels old and done already. In many ways T3 felt too much like a remake of T2, without any of the human elements that made T2 so great. I also could not help but cringe at the acting here. The acting barely passes for decent through most of the movie, while in several places the acting is downright awful. I couldnt help laughing a few times at some of the just plain corny lines, and in particular arnold's all-around poor performance. Besides that, most of T3 felt a bit rushed, while the action was almost non-stop, the moments inbetween were very poor, showing that the director was only really paying attention to the action sequences and special effects, unlike cameron who masterfully blended the action together with a sutible amount of drama and softer scenes, without coming off as corny. Im tempted to give this movie 2 stars thanks to the bad acting and poor scripting.<br />But T3 still serves a purpose if all you want is plenty of action and CG effects. If you're looking for the truely great conclusion that the series deserved... you'll be very disapointed.
0793542049|5.0|Being a musician already, I like this book because it doesn't move to slow through the beginning.  It gives a few pages of introduction to music, but it doesn't overkill.  The progression through the material is excellent as well.  The pace is good, and explanations helps to make these exercises worthwhile.  <BR>    I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to expand on their prior bass knowledge, and get into some jazz and blues.  I have taken big leaps in my playing, and I haven't had it for very long.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This film has been somewhat misadvertised in order to get mainstream audiences into the theatre and into the movie stores, and many of the ads try to stamp this movie as a &quot;Bill Murray Comedy.&quot;  If you rent or buy this DVD with the intention of viewing &quot;What About Bob in Japan&quot; you will surely be dissapointed.  &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a dramatic and realistic take on loneliness and the brief yet powerful connections we can make in unexpected moments of our lives.  It is not a manipulative film; rather, the camera will sit in on a scene and let you eavesdrop on these people when they are alone or with others.  The film asks you to become invested enough to pay attention to everything, from facial expressions, to character psychology, to the kaleidiscope of scenes and situations, to the symbolism of the dialogue.  This is a very SUBTLE film, and requires the utmost attention and respect when viewing.  BUT-if you can give it that respect and investment, you will walk away completely rewarded and satisfied, as this is true movie making of the highest order.  The emotions, the colors, the cinematography, the moody music, the ebb and flow vibe of the film itself.  And finally, the comedy: yes, there is comedy, and it is funny, but please be forewarned that it takes a second seat to the characters and the atmosphere.  All of this mixed together with the FANTASTIC acting of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson (watch her facial expressions at all times), and you have a film that is more an experience than a movie.  Just remember: although this film is incredible, it cannot be watched in every situation.  You will most likely not enjoy the movie if (a) you invite a bunch of friends over to drink and watch a funny film, or (b)you throw it in the player because there's nothing else to do and only half pay attention to it.  The ideal way to view a film as subtle and atmospheric as this is to watch it with someone you care about or with people whom you know are patient enough to make the investment.  Make sure there are no distractions around, sit back, dim the lights, and watch this film with unexpecting eyes.<br />NOTE: DVD extras are okay; watch &quot;Lost on Location&quot; which is simply a home video of the day-by-day shooting and shows Bill Murray being Bill Murray behind the scenes-which is a really good thing.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|A great flick.  <BR>Movies should be entertaining and this one certainly was.  Although I like special effects and action, I want an interesting plot, substantial character development, and a strong ending to give a high rating.<BR>This movie had it all.<br />I don't understand those few people who criticized the movie for lack of authenticity.  For example:<br />   &quot;His reinterpretations of these classic beasts are of the lamest, failing at almost every point to use their full potential. Instead of coming out during a full moon, the lycans can change whenever they want. Silver bullets only work if you use about a hundred of them. And the wolves are the more formidable of the two species. The so-called-vampires aren't even really vampires. They have reflections, don't drink blood, and run away like panicked deer at the first sign of danger. Without guns, the lycans tear them apart like wet tissue paper.&quot;<br />Not entirely true.  OK, it takes a lot of silver bullets to kill Lycans. But not all Lycans can become wolves when they want... only the most experienced ones can.  And wolves are not always the most formidible ones.  The only hand-to-hand fight between vampire and Lycan was between this HUGE African-American guy and a normal size vampire in the beginning of the movie.  The movie has to establish early on that the wolves were dangerous.  And I would expect the big guy to win.  The lead vampire, Victor, was much stronger than any of the wolves.  Also, vampires do drink blood... that was a bit thick to be wine served.  And the safe house had plasma in the refrigerator.  And vampire don't run away from fights.. thats why they hunt down the Lycans, remember.  Did this guy watch the whole movie or what?  Sigh.<br />Rent it first, as I did.  I asked my wife to get it for Valentine's day.  Well, it is a love story (hehe).
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Its an art film made with the best of intentions: &quot;let's through out all the rules and make something totally different.&quot;  Well they did, and the result is a romatic comedy without romance and without comedy.  And the worst part is the missed opportunity, for Johansson and Murray do have chemistry, but it is smothered by pretentious adolescent symbolism.  This movie is tedious, irritating, banal, with sparks of brilliance that never last long and leave the viewer frustrated and worst: bored.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Talk about a success story! Ask any normal movie-goer before 1995 who Pixar was, they would have given you a direct blank stare. In fact, unless you were well familiar with animated shorts, you would be hard pressed to find an average Joe who really knew that such an animation facility was in operation. After 1995 and the prodigious success of their first full-length animated venture, Toy Story, Pixar Animation Studios grew with tremendous strength partnering with Walt Disney Pictures in distributing their future animated films. That deal is now in serious question on whether it will be renewed or will result in the parting of the two studios. On Disney's side, the executives may be leaning more and more toward giving in to Pixar's demands considering the animation studio's features have brought in a combined $600 million domestically alone and recouping their budgets with each release. This is opposite to several of Disney's animated feature films such as Fantasia 2000, Dinosaur, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire that have failed to meet expectations. What happens with the two studios after this may hinder on the success or failure of Monsters Inc.<br />The story center around the misadventures of two monsters that create havoc in the secret monster city. James P. Sullivan works for Monsters Inc., a company that provides energy for Monstropolis. How do they obtain this energy you ask? By going into the bedrooms of children, scaring the young ones and gathering their screams which power everything from cars to lights. Sulley is the best of the best, thanks in part to his buddy Mike Wazowski who helps him on the scare floor. What's more is that everyone seems to just love the big guy, everyone except Randall Boggs, who continuously attempts to pull ahead of Sulley in the scare numbers only to fail. Everything in Sulley's life seems to be going perfectly, that is until he accidentally lets a small little girl into the monster world. From there, all hell breaks loose. Disney and Pixar once again create a picture perfect story that is filled with humor and heart. If you don't usually cry while watching a movie, you'll be hard pressed to see a dry eye including your own while watching this charming tale.<br />One of the most engaging aspects of Monsters Inc. has to be the vibrant voices behind the delightful, and at times scary, characters. The teaming of Billy Crystal and John Goodman has to be one of the biggest, if not the best, highlights of the film with each actor playing off each other gracefully and showcasing perfect chemistry together within the course of the feature. Steve Buscemi gives an utterly chilling voice-over performance for the slippery and cunning Randall Boggs. The familiar voice, at least for many adults going to see Monsters, brings about much needed sinister-like quality to outweigh the humor and the heart-tugging emotions that might have over-flooded the feature had the character not been added.<br />Overall, Monsters Inc. serves as a perfect example of the blending of intensity, humor, and heart so perfectly, it could only have come from the talented artists and writers at Disney and Pixar. They manage once again to out-due their previous successes including the original Toy Story and its sequel in both quality and storytelling unlike most films which, from film to film, tend to take a step backward. As effective as the feature was, there were moments where the filmmakers try too hard pulling off tear-jerker moments and eventually the emotions become a bit much. The ending to the film was a bit of a disappointment especially after it brings the audience to such an emotional peak as the film draws closer to its finale. What makes the ending more disappointing is that it seems to hint at a possible sequel that could never happen under the current Disney and Pixar agreement. But those squabbles are nothing compared to the overall effectively entertaining humor and visuals from one of the best family features inquite awhile.

031286504X|5.0|As a little boy I remember watching \\"The Omega Man\\" through the crack of my bedroom door--bed-time was well past. It became my favorite horror film because it requires deep thinking and analysis of what the world--and your psyche--would be like when you are the last remaining \\"normal\\" human being. Movies based on books can be so far apart from the orignal story that it would seem that the name was highjacked only as a box-office draw. This book while not the same has all the darkness and developed ethos and pathos of \\"The Omega Man.\\" I would--and will--read this book several more times in my life. It so well written that I wish the \\"great\\" authors would write more books like this. If you are a horror and/or sci-fi fan, here is a great book for you. If you are a modern day pseudo-vampire, you will be disappointed for there is no romance related to the life of a vampire. The author makes it is clear that the dead are really dead, the tertiary beings--who are now the new species of homo-sapien--are deluded, and Neville is and always will be Legend.

In all fairness, this could very well be considered the sequel to that album.<br />Johnson utilizes the same group of musicians as the previous disc and continues to flourish with his soulful, playful and hook-layered songwriting.<br />Musically, Jack Johnson's style is smooth and laid-back but never boring while his lyrics are pure inoffensive poetry.<br />All 16 tracks on this album are standouts and are breaths of fresh air in the light of the teeny-bopper and 'image-saturated' music which unfortunately is all the rage these days.<br />Hats off to Jack Johnson for another solid collection of great songs.<br /><br />On a personal note: Hats also go off to my friend Allison for introducing me to Jack Johnson's music. Thanks Alli.
0553208845|5.0|Being a little boy at the time, I surmise that the work of<br />Hermann Hesse was possibly one of the cornerstones of<br />the counter-culture found in the 1960's. His Siddhartha<br />is a gentle tale about a very learned boy who goes<br />through the various stages of life's illusions and the<br />subsequent disillusionment. As always, Hesse<br />paints a colorful and warm picture of the searching<br />spirit in transition, the need to be an individual,<br />as well the impact of friendship and attainable goals.<br />Such a short book, such a fine story.
B0000CGV00|5.0|CREDO is simply one of the most extraordinary CDs ever to be released.  DGG has set a precedent for significant 'recordings' that can only enhance the future of Classical Music survival for the home listener.  The concept of this thoughtful grouping of four works is the brain child of the phenomenal pianist Helene Grimaud the concept of interweaving musical threads from Bach and Beethoven through the contemporary John Corigliano and Arvo Part results here in an experience that is at once satisfying to the mind and to the heart.  This is programming at its best!<br />Helene Grimaud is a pianist of great dexterity and intelligence, but she is also a pianist who imbues the composers' works with inner strength of spirit and is not afraid to allow her own convictions about the piece to come forward.  One is reminded of the great Romantic pianists whose personality enhanced their playing instead of seeming to concentrate on mere reproduction of the composers' wishes.  Her playing is warm, the strength coming from not just the fingers but the entire body.  She is partnered by Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra and Choir and as always, Salonen finds the essence of the works in a way as fresh as the finest conductors of history (and present).<br />The CD opens with John Corigliano's Fantasia on a theme from the Beethoven 7th Symphony's 'Allegretto' - a work of haunting spare beauty played with mysticism by Grimaud.  This whisper segues into the Tempest Sonata by Beethoven in which Grimaud demonstrates that she can delve into the majesty of Beethoven with the finest of Beethoven specialists.  Almost without pause the third work (Beethoven's Choral Fantasy) begins and by the time the chorus enters it is difficult not to feel as though we are witnessing Elysian.  The true surprise of the CD is the final selection which is Part's &quot;Credo&quot; composed for piano, orchestra and chorus and uses a direct quotation at the piano of a Bach prelude that leads into a harrowingly dramatic Credo as sung and played by Salonen's energetically supporting conducting and forces. This is overwhelmingly and beautifully an homage to the indomitable human spirit.<br />The accompanying booklet includes a poetic introduction by Grimaud and a conversation between Grimaud and Michael Church, both of which further substantiate the significance of the originality of Helene Grimaud's philosophy. She is a Colorist and a keeper of the soul.  This CD is a must for every type of lover of classical music. Instead of 5 stars, it deserves 10!at leads into a harrowingly dramatic Credo as sung and played by Salonen's energetically supporting conducting and forces.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|Unfortunately, this movie feels like an end-of-the-semester project a film student makes in order to graduate. It tries so hard to be something, that it actually ends up being nothing. Sofia probably had a lot of things to say about lonliness and being a stranger in a strange land, but for some reason, she thought she didn't have to actually have her characters do or say anything. Apparently we'll 'get it' through osmosis. There are endless shots of Bill and Scarlett staring out of windows, sitting in silence or doing things that add nothing to the movie (hitting a golf shot, for instance). These &quot;figure it out for yourself because I'm too busy being an artist&quot; scenes might have worked if these characters had been fleshed out to any degree. Instead, we watch two morose human beings walk around for 2 slow, tedious, uninteresting, maddening, and frustrating hours. There is one word why this film saw the light of day: Coppola.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Absolutely the best DVD I,ve ever seen.If anything,it was better than the theatrical presentation that I saw 2 years ago.The documentaries and special features alone are worth the price,particularly the &quot;History of Technicolor&quot;.
0380973464|3.0|I wanted to like this book. I enjoyed Stephenson's earlier books and was looking forward to this one. Sadly the book's virtues did not outweigh its lame ending so that I can only give it a mediocre 3 rating.<br />Like his previous books, Stephenson creates a fascinating web of storyline and characters. I loved Bobby Shaftoe. I could totally relate to Randy. The characters are bold and heroic. The storyline is intricate and funny. The WWII story kept me wanting to read more and the history of cryptography was very interesting.<br />But like a lot of books today (Tad Williams, Robert Jordan, Michelle West), this one suffers from its own length. While only mediocre at 900 pages, it could have been excellent at 600 pages. These prominent authors seems to have no editors, and they ramble on and on, weakening their own stories. Since this is a one of a kind book, it does not suffer from sequelitis (yet) but lots of the 900 pages were taken up by stream of consciousness irrelevancy in the Infinite Jest vein. If you enjoy these passages, you will like the book more than I did. I felt that they wasted ink that was sorely needed for a good ending.<br />In addition to the many, completely unnecessary pages about ejaculation and the like, I was stunned by the ending. After reading 900 pages, the book just, well, ends. The story wasn't tied up at all! I kept turning pages looking for more content but in the end just had to accept the fact that the book has a sucky ending.<br />Books today have become a lot like politics. The product just doesn't seem to be as good as in the past but you have to pick someone, so you keep going back to usual, albeit disappointing, suspects. I will continue to read Stephenson's books (for a while) but the publishing game today offends me; it seems to be about big names, big thick books, and never-ending sequels. The industry is pushing quantity over quality and these three factors are clearly designed to part you from your money... I miss the days of JRR Tolkien, when an author could write a great beginning, middle AND ending.of JRR Tolkien, when an author could write a great beginning, middle AND ending.
B00014K5TQ|3.0|\\"Party Monster\\" the movie draws from James St. James' book \\"Disco Bloodbath\\" and from film shot for the \\"Party Monster\\" shockumentary.   The \\"Party Monster\\" movie purports to tell the tale of the rise and fall of Michael Alig, using trained actors and screenwriters. There would be adjustments to the story to suit the film market.  The results of this are mixed.<br />Some pieces worked well.  <br />Strengthening the James St. James part (played by Seth Green) brought a hazy character from the shockumentary close to the center of the film.  James becomes the drug-addled conscience of the movie.  (There is an offsetting loss of Angel Melendez's brother, Johnny, the hero of the shockumentary.)  <br />Using real Club Kids and their actual costumes helped bring enthusiasm and energy to the film.<br />The Peter Gatien character (Dylan McDermott) was more of a presence in the film than in the shocumentary, giving more background on the economics of hosting the Club Kids.<br />The role of drugs in Alig's downfall was made clearer in the movie.<br />There was a downside too.<br />I just can't believe this Michael Alig (played by Macaulay Culkin) would be able to convice Peter Gatien to give him a chance.  The real Michael Alig of the shockumentary (charismatic even behind bars) had the charm and drive to pull it off.<br />While frequently showing Michael Alig, James St. James and others camping it up, the film takes too much care not to show Michael Alig acting on his homosexual drives.  On his way to giving a first date kiss to DJ Keoki (Wilmer Valderrama) inside a garbage dumpster (don't ask), the camera cuts to skyrockets.  Michael and James dance once and touch carefully, but that's all.  In the shockumentary, Michael is arrested at his new boyfriend's place in New Jersey.  In the movie he and girlfriend gitsie (Chloe Sevigny) take a bubble bath together, deep kiss, and are spooning as the police arrive.  Mustn't frighten the audience.<br />The death, disposal, and investigation of Angel Melendez (Wilson Cruz) were more complete and understandable in the shockumentary, although the film showed enough for me.  Freez was scarier in the shockumentary.  Cruz did a convincing job.<br />Michael Alig has skin shots; there are discrete skin flashes from some Club Kids.<br />There is an ok directors' commentary and brief actor interviews. <br />If you really want to know what happened, read the book or see the shockumentary.  If you want to see a focused story, this movie is all right.  Also, if you like Seth Green here, take a look at \\"The Attic Expeditions.\\"
B00014K5TQ|5.0|This is the movie that stars Macaulay Culkin as Michael Alig, the Midwestern boy who moved to New York City with big dreams of stardom. It all ended horribly in  debauchery, drugs, and death.  (Not his, though.)  <br />Macaulay Culkin got horrible reviews for his portrayal as Alig, but I seriously believe that anyone that gave him a bad review obviously is not familiar with the real story at all. I've seen countless interviews with Michael Alig and I think Mac nailed his personality dead-on.  Alig had a larger-than-life persona, very fake, superficial, and selfish.  He helped create a bizarre late 80's phenomenon called The Club Kids.  The Club Kids were a group of twenty-somethings that dressed up in homemade costumes, plastered themselves with make-up (some of who looked like they stepped right out of Kabuki Theater by way of a major acid trip), and spent their nights clubbing.  They became known on a national level when their frequent appearances on talk shows like Geraldo, Phil Donahue, and Sally Jessy Raphael became some of the highest rated episodes ever for those shows.  The movie is based on the book \\"Disco Bloodbath\\" which was written by Alig's co-Club Kid James St. James (brilliantly portrayed by Seth Green in the movie).  <br />The directors of the movie, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato,  directed a 1998 documentary about Michael Alig which was also called \\"Party Monster.\\"  Anyone that watches the movie should watch the documentary (which is also out on DVD) first. The movie also stars Chloe Sevigny, Wilson Cruz (from one of my all time favorite TV shows, \\"My So-Called Life\\"), Wilmer Valderrama, Natasha Lyonne, Diana Scarwid (from \\"Mommie Dearest\\"!!!), Dylan McDermott, and Marilyn Manson (whose part really is just a glorified cameo).  <br />I guess the reason why I was so interested in this movie is because I was always completely glued to the TV whenever The Club Kids were on a talk show.  They were this huge train wreck that was just SO entertaining towatch.  Michael Alig wound up murdering, out of self defense, fellow Club Kid Angel over drug money.  He chopped up Angel's body, stuck it all in a TV box, and dropped it in a river.  There's even footage on the documentary where Michael admits to killing Angel before he was ever accused or arrested, not thinking that anyone would ever take him seriously. He was so zonked out on drugs, it was just impossible for him to think clearly.  <br />The movie is by no means a GREAT movie, but it is good- and certainly doesn't deserve the horrible reviews that it received. I suppose that in order to be a great movie, it should be able to stand on its own. \\"Party Monster\\" probably won't do that for every single person that watches it. If you like the actors or are interested in and/or remember The Club Kids, you'll more than likely enjoy this dark movie. Like I said, you need to be familiar with the back story and the documentary to probably really appreciate it.  It's also rather low budget, but I think they did a pretty good job with the set design and costumes.  A lot of the original Club Kids are extras in the flick, so that adds a certain amount of authenticity.  <br />Anyone that only thinks of \\"Home Alone\\" when they think of Macaulay Culkin will be surprised by his performance.  I give his perfomance two big thumbs up.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation provides Bill Murray with an ideal role, playing a washed up actor making a commercial in Tokyo for a quick buck.  He's been married forever and is growing increasingly emotionally aloof; however, something tells him that he's not happy.  Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a young woman who's been married to her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) for two years.  She recently completed college and feels lost, with no idea where she fits into the world.  Somehow these two confused souls find each other amidst the jumble of Tokyo and form an unlikely bond.<br />People may go into this movie with many misconceptions, particularly thinking it's a typical Bill Murray comedy. You'll likely chuckle a few times but there are few riotously funny scenes, although I did laugh pretty hard when Murray encounters the \\"Premium Fantasy woman.\\"  Likewise, the pace is measured and some of the scenes may seem unnecessary, as they seem to add more to the tone of the movie than the plot; stick with this movie despite it's languorous pace.  Ultimately, Lost in Translation is a genre-defying movie - part drama, part broad comedy, part black comedy, part romance, and so forth.  However, what it does remind me of the most is a classic 1940s movie - Brief Encounter; both are understated romances whereby two people meet tenuously and find hope.<br />I really disliked Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, the amateurish Virgin Suicides.  However, she is in full control of her craft in this movie.  She's found a unique voice that astutely addresses the disaffection and isolation so many of us feel in the modern world.  Justifiably, she's become the first American woman to be nominated for Best Director by the Academy Awards and only the third woman in history to receive this honor.  In addition to the superior direction, Bill Murray is outstanding, balancing his natural talents in comedy and pathos luminously.  Overall, I most highly recommend this movie.<br />Extras - The DVD contains a number of extras, including a fascinating backstage documentary filmed by Sofia Coppola's then husband, Spike Jonze, as well as a plethora of deleted scenes.e DVD contains a number of extras, including a fascinating backstage documentary filmed by Sofia Coppola's then husband, Spike Jonze, as well as a plethora of deleted scenes.
B00005JME0|3.0|I must say this movie was strange and the only reason I went to see it was that my younger Brother was cast as an extra. (prison scene, yes they are real imates from Monroe washinton in this film) I wanted to see if his scenes were in the film.  They were, in fact he got to throw a wad of paper at Ashton Kutcher charater and yell 'hey you maggot...' or other words.  He was only in the lunchroom sence, the one drinking the milk (table behind Ashton left shoulder), and in the main yard there is a group of imates (real ones) staring at the 'new guy'.<br />Overall if you have kids, the scene with the children is quite distrubing.  Not that they show anything, the suggest that young kids (<12) had a sexual encounter.<br />If you can stand flash backs, and F!bombs go see this movie..<br />- NTS
B000002H33|5.0|At the time \\"Master of Puppets\\" was released, Rolling Stone magazine could not have cared less.  Most well respected music critics probably dismissed it as \\"juvenile garbage\\".  Eighteen years later, it appears on Rolling Stone's \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" as number 167.  But, if the album didn't have such a huge impact on music, they would still be ignoring it.<br />James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich came from rich and middle class environments, but when they picked up musical instruments they became blue collar working class heroes.  Metallica had a work ethic that came straight from hardcore punk.  No MTV videos, no compromising radio friendly songs, no hip glossy photos of the band, no make-up, no hair spray, and no BS people pleasing; just  down-to-earth, straight ahead, in your face thrash metal.  They earned their respect through powerful, creative albums and killer live shows.<BR>\\"Master of Puppets\\" is a rare type of album.  It's very difficult to make an album that is complex in song writing and still has a pulverizing emotional impact.  Usually, highly skilled musicians get too caught up in trying to impress people with their technical ability.  Not Metallica.  <BR>When they start crunching and chugging, it sounds like total devastation.  When they kick their guitar riffs into high gear, it is a blast of pure, manic energy straight to the heart.  A single guitar riff and then a sudden blast of all the instruments coming through like a juggernaut.  Start and stops like throwing punches.  The rhythm of a fight.<BR>In the title track \\"Master of Puppets\\", the serene interludes' matches the effects of a snorted line of cocaine perfectly.  The pace of \\"Battery\\" is the soundtrack to primal, violent aggression that lies deep within every human being.  \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", one of the best songs on the album, has extremely heavy riffs which emphasizes the dark, evil subject matter.<BR>\\"Keep him tied it makes him well / He's getting better can't you tell?\\".  That verse still sends chills down my spine fifteen years after I first heard it.  Lyrics usually don't make an album, but the lyrics on \\"Master of Puppets\\" are like a bitter sweet cherry on top of this delicious album. <BR>\\"Ride the Lightning\\", Master of Puppets\\", and \\"...And Justice for All\\" are the greatest albums in rock history without question (I like the way another reviewer called those three albums a trilogy).  \\"..And Justice for All\\" was their swan song and masterpiece.  It was also their last album as far as I'm concerned.<BR>Metallica carried over the hardcore punk spirit from the metal side.  Their ethics they once had were absolutely respectable to legendary proportions.  They played louder, faster, and harder than anyone else.<br />Professional music critics need to be more honest and ignore music that doesn't come from or resemble music from the sixties and seventies.  They really show how out of touch they are when they praise an album ten years after its release.  \\"Master of Puppets\\" just doesn't fit in with Radiohead, the Cure, and the Beatles.

B0000931QA|5.0|Remember when rock music held the promise of social change? There is something about having a Bush back in the oval office that makes this album relevant in strange new ways. Originally released back in 1988, this rock opera tells the story of Nikki, a dropout of the Regan era and a heroin addict, who tries to make a difference in society by joining an underground revolutionary movement headed by Doctor X. You can feel his frustration and hope for a better future in &quot;Speak&quot;:<br />Seven years of power<br />The corporation claw<br />The rich control the government, the media the law<br />To make some kind of difference<br />Then everyone must know<br />Eradicate the fascists, revolution will grow<br />The system we learn says we're equal under law<br />But the streets are reality, the weak and poor will fall<br />Let's tip the power balance and tear down their crown<br />Educate the masses, We'll burn the White House down<br />Speak to me the pain you feel<br />Speak the word [Revolution]<br />The word is all of us<br />Unfortunately for Nikki, he learns that even his revolution will not allow him to think for himself, he just waits for the call to learn his next target. The good doctor provides the drugs he need and the sense of purpose towards a greater good in exchange for Nikki's killing skills. The role of the doctor is played remarkably like Cancer Man from the X-files.<br />When Nikki goes rouge, the revolution finds a way to silence him. Operation Mindcrime is in my mind the most complex and socially meaningful rock opera in existence. Its major difference from utopian social commentary is that it shows the limitations of the people controlling a social revolution for the supposed good of the masses while still showing the responsibility of the status quo government for the revolutionary impulse. Thus, Operation Mindcrime does not provide easy solutions but exposes the basic problems of our fiscally divided society.
B0000CABBW|4.0|\\"Whale Rider\\" is not a typical film in the Hollywood tradition.  It has no big name stars, is filmed entirely in New Zealand and often dwells in the darker side of people.  Although, having said that, the film does have a happy ending and thus ends on a positive tone.<br />I cannot truly say that I enjoyed the film and although Keisha Castle-Hughes has been nominated for an Oscar as best actress, I think this, in itself, overstates what is a worthy film without ever being great.  In fact, although the characters are quite believable, I had some difficulty empathising with them.<br />For Americans, which is where all films try to succeed, I would recommend another New Zealand film as an introduction to this genre.  That is, rather than see \\"Whale Rider\\", try to locate a copy of \\"Once were Warriors\\".  This is gritty film making at its best and the best product to ever come from New Zealand.
0800177177|5.0|Let me get this right off my chest: this movie really isn't that scary, but it isn't supposed to be! This new version of Dracula featuring some of Hollywood's best young talent, and directed by the legendary Francis Ford Copolla is an awesome movie. The most faithful film to the book yet, this film is an incredible, artistic moviemaking masterpiece! The movie stars Gary Oldman, Keanu Reeves, and Winona Ryder. It also atars Anthony Hopkins, who does a great job in the film. Gary Oldman is fantastic as Dracula, and he is a believable, spooky character. Keanu Reeves is actually pretty good in the film, but he doesn't show up much in the role of Jonathan Harker. Winona is compelling as the distressed Mina, but every now and then she tended to bore me. It is still a great acting effort! The sound in Dracula won an Academy Award, and for good reason! The music is compelling and a bit overdone, with sweeping movie strings and broad percussion. But the sound is exceptional, and it made my ears happy. <BR>Visually, Dracula is astounding, and it was acknowledged by the Academy in this category as well. The costumes are incredible, and the set design is the best in the last ten years. It captures your eye at a fast pace, and really the whole movie is fast-paced, stunning, and a great thriller. Buyer beware, this is not another pathetic slasher film, but I don't care because I am not much into those films anyway. Dracula is depressing, beautiful, full of energy, and bursting with compassion. It is a must-see, five star effort in filmmaking!
B000092ZYX|4.0|Like other Radiohead fans I was eager for this CD to come out.  And I loved it when I first got it.  I am still, in fact, quite fond of it.  But it does not hold up compared to OK Computer or Kid A, and probably isn't even as good as The Bends or Amnesiac.<br />There are some very fine moments on this CD.  &quot;2+2=5&quot; is one of their best songs ever; and maybe half a dozen other songs are notable to various degrees... &quot;Sit Down Stand Up&quot;, &quot;The Gloaming&quot;, &quot;There There&quot;, A Punchup at a Wedding&quot;, &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;, and &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot;.<br />My problem with this CD is the lesser songs, which have to be the dullest stuff R'head has ever put out.. &quot;Backdrifts&quot; sounds as if the band was too tired to give the song a decent go; &quot;Go To Sleep&quot; sounds like it came straight off of Led Zeppelin III; &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot; is pseudo-gothic tripe (is this song supposed to be ironic or not?); and &quot;I Will&quot; is a retread, written years ago and rejected for previous CDs but included here.<br />My expectations for Radiohead's CDs is admittedly much higher than it is for most bands -- with their prior work, they've set the bar high.  But in my opinion, compared to their previous 4 albums, this CD is half filler, and sounds half-baked.  (Maybe that's unfair though.. it is still better than 99% of what's out there, and makes my Top 10 list for 2003.  Go figure.)<br />PS As a footnote -- most of us listen to Radiohead for daring, inventive, exciting, intelligent music.. and the lyrics (when we can understand them) often come second (&quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; notwithstanding).  I think the lyrics on HTTT are probably Thom Yorke's best yet.. focused on a broad theme of (get this!) good and evil, damnation and hope, full of religious imagery, devils and angels.. you can tell (as he has said in interviews) that he's been reading his Dante.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|If you saw the movie and liked it then sure...buy the DVD. But if you haven't seen the movie I'll just say this: the director obviously watched The Monkees back in the 70's because that's about the extent of his creative vision. We stopped watching after 20 minutes because it was so trite and boring.
B00005JLXE|4.0|This movie was a lot better then I expected (just goes to show you that you cant always trust what reviewers have to say).  I watched this with my wife and son and all three of us enjoyed it.  True it was a little silly in parts but it was a lot more believeable then say &quot;Charlies Angels&quot; or &quot;The Hulk&quot;.  This was a fun movie to watch and unlike a lot of movies in this genre I never got bored watching it.  It had some very nice camera work and some really good special effects as well as some of the most interesting villains Ive ever seen.
B000089RVX|5.0|Did you ever wonder what would happen if Tori Amos got together with Queensryche?<br />My hunch is that the result might sound something like the new band Evanescence. The Oxford English Dictionary defines Evanescence as:<br />1. The process or fact of vanishing away.<br />2. The quality of being evanescent; tendency to vanish away.<br />3. concr. An evanescent thing. rare.<br />I for one, hope that this promising freshman band will stick around. You probably know the band for their hit &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; from the Daredevil soundtrack. I didn't see the movie nor do I have MTV, so my first exposure was while listening to local station 98KUPD. I immediately knew that I had to find out more about this band, &quot;to the internet!&quot; A quick search later and I had found the answer from dozens of fan sites that had already sprung up on the 'net.<br />Little Rock Band founders, Amy Lee and Ben Moody, describe their music as &quot;rock ... But the twist is that the band's music is epic, dramatic, dark rock.&quot; While they don't achieve the dark drama of Black Sabbath's &quot;Headless Cross&quot;, they come very close given the processed sound that the major record labels currently produce. Fallen's songs are largely concerned with &quot;dark&quot; topics such as death, betrayal and loss; but some songs hold glimmers of hope as in &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet.&quot; The latter is an interesting dark metaphor equating Christian salvation to a tourniquet, something of a spiritual last resort. I should note that Lee and Moody do not see Evanescence as a &quot;Christian Band&quot; and indeed there is not the evangelical feel of, say Stryper, when listening to the album.<br />For my part, many of the songs seem concerned about loosing oneself in another as in &quot;Going Under,&quot; &quot;i'm going under / drowning in you / i'm falling forever / i've got to break through&quot; and in &quot;Haunted,&quot; &quot;watching me / wanting me / i can feel you pull me down.&quot;<br />One of the songs that I enjoy the most is &quot;Imaginary.&quot; As a lit person I can appreciate the introspective viewpoint this song is written from: &quot;i linger in the doorway / of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name / let me stay / where the wind will whisper to me / where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story&quot;. Clearly there is an escapist element where the outside world is chaotic and harsh. What really makes this song for me is the careful ebb and flow of tension with the release given by the harmonies.<br />One thing I noticed while listening to Fallen is that some of the rifs, movements and phrasings reminded me of other songs. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it shows their influences, but the group may not be to the point where they are stealing instead of borrowing, if you know what I mean. Although they don't list Queensryche as an influence, I hear similarities between &quot;Whisper&quot; and Queensryche's &quot;Suite Sister Mary&quot; not only in the choral presence but even the tenor of the lyric and guitar rifs. Again, that isn't a real criticism of the album, which I think is extremely enjoyable and well done. Give them a listen.<br />Update: I just saw Evanescence in concert. They gave an energetic performance that had a real sense of spontaneity. For example, since this is their first tour they only had a limited repertoire of songs to choose from and they supplemented those with a couple of well known covers, &quot;Zero&quot; by Smashing Pumpkins and about half of Metallica's &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;. To give you a sense of how this went down, Ben, a Metallica fan, started playing the famous opening chords to &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and Amy laughed saying she didn't know all the words so the crowd would have to sing them. About halfway through the song, Amy held the microphone up to Ben suggesting he sing and the song abruptly stopped. They had a good laugh and Amy asked if they could play one of their songs. I thought Amy's voice held up pretty well even though she appeared to be struggling with the Arizona heat (it was still 100 during the concert).ey could play one of their songs.

If your idea of entertaining sci-fi is to see the captain of a starship invent an entirely new particle or ray (in between negotiations with alien gods and feelie touchie moments with the crew) to get the crew out of some silly situation they never should have gotten into.  If your idea of sci-fi is to bravely go where no one has gone before and then watch the characters retreat into a holo-deck.  Then this ain't for you.<BR>The editorial review is accurate.  The series does have ftl drive and a psi element to the plot..  This future is almost entirely devoid of AI, bio-mods and wet-ware. Really is a space western.  The characters and humor make it work.  Space Opera - without the novo-physics.<BR>I loved it.  But if you're into aliens, layers of reality/ science and epic space battles you may be disappointed.  In this future the enemy is us.
B00005AFVR|2.0|Decent, but not his best.
B000062YAZ|1.0|Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Metallica collection, but this still sounds like a joke to me. Thin production, grating, buzzsaw guitars and some of the fakest, hilarious and downright awful lyrics I've ever heard. This is not a classic, it's childs play and sounds like it was thrown together by a bunch of 9 year olds in their bedroom.<br />If anything, this is an insult to 9 year olds! Barking lyrics about Satan doesn't make you a metal band or scary, but I rate &quot;Reign In Blood&quot; 1 star for comedic value.<br />And this is considered their best work? Wow.
B0000640SA|5.0|stay away from the Limited addition dvd. Total orginal movie, i loved everything about it, but just get the regular dvd, not the limited edition, to access special features you have to perform tests??????? It's crazy, although the packaging is quite neat, which is why i bought the limited edition.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Frankly, I don't get what all the buzz is about. Going into it, I suspected there would not be any gratuitous physical relationship between the main characters defined by an older Bill Murray and a far, far younger Scarlett Johannson simply because the notion would prove outrageous even by today's cultural standards. As movie craft, the only continuity in this film is established in the beginning when Bill Murray arrives in Tokyo for a brief acting gig and at the end of the film when he prepares for his departure. If every other scene filmed were represented as a playing card, any film editor in the world could reshuffle the deck, turn the cards over and come up with the same random film.  Shots of Murray sitting in a bar.  Shots of Johannson looking out a window. Shots of both talking on the phone. Shots of a brilliantly lighted techno-neon Tokyo. Shots of colorful fast talking Japanese personalities expressing themselves in a manner generally incoherent to the average Westerner. Shots of Murray and Johansson talking to or at one another, and mostly wistfully at that. Both characters have issues of loneliness and that's all they have in common, except that they are wealthy enough to share the same upscale hotel experience while staying in Tokyo. Sorry Sophia, this flick to me was akin to a highly praised abstract painting and proved just a bit too artsy for my unsophisticated midwestern sensibilities to absorb or fully appreciate.
0385510438|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books to date and he is certainly one of my favorite authors, however, for a while there he was scaring me.  Not to say his non-legal books were not good or well written, but I guess they were somewhat of a shock to me and as a result I did not appreciate them or his change of style that much.  Well, he came back with a bang with his new book &quot;The Last Juror&quot; and I fell right back in awe with his unique style and readability.  All in all, I highly recommend this book to old and new Grisham fans alike
B00005JMJ4|3.0|By now, I am certain that everyone knows the &quot;plot summary.&quot; Essentially Bill Murray, a washed-up actor doing tiresome whiskey endorsements in Japan, forms a unlikely frienship with an equally disaffect recent college graduate/bored wife in Scarlett Johanson. The movie does not particularly progress from here, other than to try to offer up a &quot;slice of life&quot; as these two sometimes hang out, other times don't, in a strange land.<br />The film is carried by a spot-on Bill Murray, who could not look more weary and subtley sarcastic in this film, the charismatic Scarlett Johansson, and the sensory overload of Tokyo itself. Tokyo provides a lot of material for Murray and Johansson to work off of, and they do it well. Though you do not laugh out loud much, the movie does enjoy a great chuckling sense of humor throughout, and a genuine heart in the shared emptyness of Murray and Johansson contrasted with the pounding insistence of Tokyo.  There is no true plot, just a slight joy in sharing this unusual experience with the characters. Not everyone will like this movie, and if you choose not to invest yourself in the characters, you will bored senseless. But it is a film that can be rewarding.<br />So it was packaging in a sterling example of &quot;what not to do on a DVD.&quot; 1. Do NOT force people to watch previews (though an onscreen message says you can fast forward through, pressing &quot;MENU&quot; in fruitless. If they are reminded people they can fast forward, they obviously know we don't care about the previews, right? So why torment us?). 2. Please, for the love of God, put some real special features on there. Deleted scenes RARELY are interesting, and the vast majority of the time shoudl have remained so.<br />So, 4 out of 5 stars for the film, 2 out of 5 for the DVD. Thus, 3 out of 5.
B00005JLKB|4.0|This First Season DVD set is a great way to introduce someone to the &quot;Smallville&quot; legacy. Over the span of six discs, all of Season one is shown, from the Pilot episode to the sean finale &quot;Tempest.&quot; &quot;Smallville: The Complete First Season&quot; also contains commentary from the cast and crew of the show, as well as a tour of the town of Smallville. While this is an amazing DVD set, the series still was in its beginnings. This is the reason we see so many &quot;villians of the week&quot; in season one, but the show still remained enjoyable. For fans of the show and new-comers, this DVD collection is a must-have!!!
0671027387|5.0|One of the best books that will keep you guessing until the end.  Some unique charaters really add intrique to the plot.  Nothing else i can say withhout giving away the story.  P.S. It's only $4.99 at Costco!  That's where i got mine...
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This movie is really nothing too special at all. Bill Murrary sits around and scowls and drinks whiskey, letting us know he is sad. He picks up a sad, hot young number at a Tokyo bar and proceeds to have a half-romantic half-platonic reltionship with her. <br />The film's pace is as slow as a snail and the humor, while often genuinely funny, is given in small and infrequent doses.<BR>The ending is really anti-climatic, to boot.<br /> I'd recommend seeing this movie, but only because so many others seem to just love it.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I had never given much thought to Johnny Cash, sure I'd heard some of his music, but it never really &quot;stuck&quot; with me. One day, as I was watching a music channel I heard a Nine Inch Nails song, but this time it sounded different.  And lo and behold, there was johnny Cash singing it. I was amazed at the emotion that he was able to put into the song, and even more into the video. The video was so meloncholic, yet it was peaceful. You could tell that he knew his end was near, and that he had realized quite a few things in his life. Tears came to my eyes as the video ended, and the clips of Jesus were being shown, and as the music began to pound more and more.  Wow! I'd have to say that song and video brought up more emotion in me than any song ever had before. After that I searched to see what album the song was on and bought the CD, and I was not dissapointed at all.  I have to say that I enjoy every song on the CD. Although his voice is not how it used to be, i listen to the American Recordings more thatn anything else, because you can truly feel the emotion in them. Amazing!
B00008PW2D|5.0|This is a wonderful season.  When is season six going to be out.  This is the best series ever on television!
0684857219|4.0|Quick summary:<BR>- A very large part of the book is about competitive bodybuilding.  I found most of this info useless, although I guess it can help you with aesthetics if you're into weight training specifically because you want to look impressive.<BR>- Lots of pics.  Hope you like beefcake of the steroidal variety.<BR>- Some of the training recommendations don't make sense to me.  Ie. working abs every day, or doing 50 reps of pullups even if you can only do 3 in one set.  The training recommendations seem to be that you should workout muscle groups even if they aren't recuperated from the previous workout.  (ie. work each muscle group 2 or 3x per week).  This seems a little excessive, is a controversial view, and Arnold doesn't explain why this method is recommended.  If I can hardly walk from squats I did 2 days ago, I do not have any desire to do another 3 or 4 sets.  I'd love to know why I should still do them.<BR>- The discussions on supplements is very vague and by no means should be your only source of info on them.  (Ie. creatine, amino acids, HMB, etc.)  Supplementation is a very important part of weight training for maximum gains, and you need to do much more research than this book provides in order to decide what to use and how to use it.<br />So I'd say this is a 5-star book if you're into competitive bodybuilding, but a 3-star book if you are just looking for good weight training recommendations (like myself.)
1572524219|3.0|I loved the movie and highly recomend it for Ingrid fans. Of course I needed the Swedish subtitles, but you must be aware that the audio in the movie is distorted and of very poor quality, so beware! The movie is expensive and one would think it would be of better quality. I kept the movie in my collection because in this case, I don't need the sound to follow the storyline. Thank god for the subtitles.
B000002UAU|5.0|When I first bought Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band, I was a casual Beatles fan and had never heard any of the songs on the CD except Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, which I really enjoyed.  I got home and popped the CD into the player and over the next 45 minutes I realized that never again would I experience something like that.  The thing about Sgt. Pepper is, you know you're listening to something special and groundbreaking the SECOND the first song starts.  I won't run down each song because in my mind, it all runs together as one big thing.  But I will mention &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;...that song will stay with you for days after you listen to it.  Not necessarily because it's catchy...but it just messes with your head and when it's over you feel almost speechless.  If you decide to purchase this CD, understand that when you first listen to it, it'll completely captivate you like you've never felt before.  It's the greatest feeling in the world about the greatest album in the world.
B000099T2L|2.0|I Like Beyonce. She can sing somewhat well and she's pretty. No wonder she's famous. She hogged the spotlight in Destiny's Child, so all 3 of those albums were pretty much all Beyonce solo albums. Dangerously In Love, the first CD marketed as just Beyonce, is terrible, in every sense of the word. There are 3 songs you should download:<br />Naughty Girl, Baby Boy, and Crazy In Love. All the ballads run together in 40 minutes of pure garbage, and Beyonce's incessant whining gets old after a while. I'm not sure who is more stupid, Beyonce's producers for putting nothing but boring slow songs on the album, or Beyonce for letting them do it. I would like to give the album 3 stars because Naughty Girl &amp; Baby Boy are really good songs, but the other ones (especially Hip Hop Star...terrible) are trash. What was she thinking? I don't know, back in her &quot;Man Bashing&quot; Days with Destiny's Child, at least the songs were decent. Maybe once she fell in love, all her talent went out of the window. The song quality decreased EXTREMELY on this album.<br />She needs to stick with the rest of Destiny's Child (BRING BACK LETOYA &amp; LATAVIA), &amp; bring back some of that old MAN BASHING flava that everyone knows &amp; loves. I Can't wait for the Destiny's Child reunion CD.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Alright lets get something straight: The White Stripes are overrated. Their lyrics aren't incredible like some people make them out to be, their guitar riffs are extremely simple to pull off, and their drummer is well... horrible. But I guess that doesn't really matter, because in the end at least everything sounds good.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This album was the atomic bomb that moved AC/DC to the top of the mushroom cloud of Heavy Metal music. Producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange absolutely understood AC/DC. Prior to this, the band was guitar heavy and concert honed, but hadn't quite found the proper sound in the studio to match their antics onstage. Lange fattened up the sound, made them concentrate on songwriting, and the band delivered the goods. The first four songs on &quot;Highway To Hell&quot; were classic rock with the boxing gloves loaded with horseshoe sized hooks.<br />As soon as the public heard it, there was chaos. Parents covered their ears, church groups had seizures and the little boys really understood. The twin guitars of Angus and Malcom Young were a declaration of war on everyone that dared stand in the band's way, and Bon Scott sang like a demon unleashed. There were no fancy concepts or mythic storylines to be found on &quot;Highway To Hell,&quot; just the testosterone blues of frustrated males around the world captured perfectly. Along with Aerosmith's &quot;Rocks&quot; and &quot;Toys In The Attic,&quot; this is seventies rock at its pinnacle.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Subtlety people. <br />1. The quality or state of being subtle, or sly; cunning; craftiness; artfulness.<BR>2. Nice discernment with delicacy of mental action; nicety of discrimination.<br />It's what makes this film great.<br />It's what's lacking in these brash, pompous, pretentious critiques I've seen here. <br />If you have the ability and patience to appreciate the slight subtleties in the film, then it will be a rewarding experience.  <br />If you expect to be handed a simple \\"boy loves girl story\\" with standardized plot lines, then prepared to be disappointed.  <br />If you've seen it, and loved it.  Wait for the next incarnation of this film on dvd.
B00005NTN5|5.0|I loved the movie so much that I bought the dvd some years ago.  Wondering though, is it just my particular dvd that has problems with the audio commentary?  It cuts out for a few minutes and it's really been bugging me.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is without any doubt one of the best conceptual albums ever written, a classic work of art that has changed the way I listen to and appreciate music forever.<BR>From the very first tune In The Flesh till the last Outside The Wall,it is a musical journey into the very dark and troubled world of Pink,a rock musician and Roger Waters alter ego, full of angst, frustrations, anger, disappointments, haunting past, failed relationships, inability to communicate with society at large or express himself to others and ultimately a burning need for redemption and inner peace.<BR>But one important factor must be clear while reviewing this masterpiece: Although it was released and produced under the Pink Floyd name, and although band members, mainly Dave Gilmour, have contributed to it, it is still a very personal work, more specifically Roger Waters's..his world, his memories and still simmering grief about his father's early death ,his alienation from his fans, and his <BR>very clear and outspoken criticism of the social, educational and political state of his beloved England, all themes that have recurred before in all Waters Pink Floyd's work from Dark Side of Moon onwards.<BR>The Wall was the result of an artist battling his own demons, at the height of his anxiety and creativity, and as if in writing it, he was trying to exorcise these demons.(For instance In Goodbye Cruel World, you can tell that the lyrics are so real, so personal and private)<BR>This personal dimension to The Wall was instrumental in touching so many listeners in a way few records were able to do before or after, and making it the all time classic that is today.<BR>The story of Pink and the wall he built around himself also touched a very raw nerve with the listeners, and most did identify with this sense of alienation that has steadily grown post 60s on a personal level, and with the bold message about the freedom and individuality of thought that educational and political establishments try to stifle on a broader level..Another Brick in the Wall pt2, and with its opening line' We don't need no education..'has become the most recognized song the world over.<BR>Musically, along with Eloy's Dawn and Power and the Passion, I have yet to hear tunes that perfectly match the mood and development of the plot!Waters and to a lesser extent Gilmour (mainly with Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell) match the life, and transformation of Pink with music so brilliantly, leading to the climax of the epic and operatic Trial. <BR>To listen to the Wall, is to live an experience that will touch your heart and engage your mind.<BR>A lot has been said about the deep rift that happened between band members while making this album, and about Waters's ego , which led to the inevitable break up in ''82-'83, but whether you like Waters attitude or vision or not, you can not deny the fact that his creative genuis and inner demons and his alone, were responsible for one of the best rock albums ever written.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|Anime and Daft Punk fans have been anticipating this DVD since the first four videos hit MTV in 2001. We never expected a merger like this, but after seeing the videos, we were glued to our seats, ready for more. It comes to a huge surprise that Discovery was semi-produced to work as a musical, which actually made me like the CD even more. <br />So finally comes the complete musical. It's non-vocal the whole way through except for lyrics which lip-synced... humorously. There is, in fact, a story only Leiji Matsumoto could think up, and it works tremendously with the music. The designs are just as innovative as anything Matsumoto, as is the storytelling. The only detractors from the whole experience are the same as what you would get from other musicals anyway, such as plot holes, really fast editing and pace (though details are given enough screen time so the story isn't lost). Also, you can't go about watching this without bumping into cliches. Still, the pros outweigh the cons more than enough to make these passable. It asks a lot of a man to create a musical where instrumental music is constantly the foreground. In this standpoint, Interstella 5555 is excellent.<br />For those who haven't heard Daft Punk's Discovery before, the album is House with extra doses of funk. It heads more into disco and shameless dance than in their last album, Homework, but it is a steady progression in their sound. Songs have more of a pop appeal this time around, repetitive minimalism is toned down a step to make way for more varied compositions. There are also a couple tracks that undoubtably were meant for cinematic treatment (&quot;Aerodynamic&quot; being the biggest example), which tend to make the album drift in a different direction. Most of the songs are catchy and memorable and definitely worth sitting through as a soundtrack.<br />It should be noted that this is one of the last cel-animated works in anime. This is during the digital takeover in anime so the compositing and motion will look a little dated. The colors, effects and tone, though, are picture-perfect. The DVD transfer is gorgeous.<br />A surprise to me are the extras. No commentary or other traditional DVD extras, but a heavy emphasis on interactivity, something reminiscient of Daft Punk's first DVD, D.A.F.T. The interactive game is cute, though passable. There is another feature, though, that mimics The Matrix DVD where an icon appears and once 'play' is clicked you get a look into the designs and backgrounds from the animation. Also included are biographies, the trailer, Karaoke (smart thinking), and others.<br />There's been a long wait for this musical, but the end result is something miles beyond expected and truly delivers. I think it goes without saying what kind of audience would appreciate a DVD like this, but it's garaunteed to get more dance music fans from the hardcore anime fans and vice versa. From the standpoint of a fan of both sides, this is a dream come true.
B0000029AP|5.0|&quot;Toys In The Attic&quot; delivered everything believers in the early Aerosmith albums had been waiting for. It was sleazy, dirty, sneaky and snaky, loud and obnoxious when required, down and nasty right were it counted and even had a cry in your beer ballad to wrap it all up. This was also the first Aerosmith album to boast full bodied production, which allowed Joe Perry's rubbery guitar a soundstage to blast from. Nine songs here, from that toychest we have five bonified classics. At the same time the rock was hard, Aerosmith were also blues mongers with a rhythm section so solid that &quot;Toys&quot; drove as hard as it played loose.<br />These were beats so solid that they influenced music makers for decades to come. Think Linkin Park or Limp Bizkit didn't have a copy of Aerosmith's Greatest Hits somewhere in their past? Or they didn't spend hours glued to Run-DMC getting it on with Tyler and Perry during the MTV Rap-remake of &quot;Walk This Way&quot;? Or that a whole bunch of rocking festivities during the Bicentennial years weren't partying wildly to &quot;Big Ten Inch?&quot;<br />&quot;Toys In The Attic&quot; by Aerosmith is essential rock from a band that had just tapped into brilliance.

B0000CAQ26|1.0|Theres not a single Good song on this CD.  Theres a few that are &quot;okay&quot; but, overall, I was completely dissapointed in this CD.  Pink went from her original style which included great party songs like &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot; &quot;Get This Party Started&quot;  and even went emotional with &quot;Family Portrait&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot;  Now, however, her songs feature horrible lyrics, boring songs, and extremely explict profanity.  Yes, you can buy it in a &quot;clean&quot; version, but even still the songs are horrible.  If you liked Pink before, stay away from this CD.  If hearing the &quot;F&quot; word gives you a buzz, you might like this CD.  Otherwise, its a complete waste of money.
B00001PE4D|5.0|this is by far the best movie i have ever seen, and i generally hate dramas! and let me just say that this movie is not just about the two girls kissing! yes, if you haven't seen it, it shows 2 chicks frenching! anyway, if you haven't seen this movie you really need to! but just beware that it is rather gross in some parts.

0452282152|2.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring is a pale rendition of the life of a simpleton maid in 17th Century Holland. It is a linear slice that offers little insight in the trials and tedium of tending to a struggling artist's household and studio. <br />You will not explore the rich values of class distinction, religious casts, beoming of age, respect or creative genius. While these elements are present, they are reduced to clichés and left to the reader to surmise.<br />Chevalier's syntax and rhythm did not lend itself to the images, fears and angst that she was ushering us through.<BR>Chevalier is narrating from a safe and comfortable position, she never managed to transcend her main character.<br />I am baffled that the book enjoyed such a wide following.
B00006CXXU|5.0|i just love this album. i think it's better than her first one. and i think beautiful,can't hold us down, the voice within are the three best songs in this album.
B00005JMEW|2.0|The film is a blood drenched, tongue-in-cheek, feminist kung-fu revenge flick, whose best moments are cold-blooded and heartbreaking, all at the same time. The fight scenes are forgettable, despite their extravagance, if only because the \\"volume 1\\" in the movie's title promises that our fearless heroine will not die before the sequel hits theaters early 2004. In other words, Quentin Tarantino is cutting off heads and spraying blood all over the camera, simply because he wants to and can. Only once do we worry about our heroine's fate -- despite knowing her fate -- during her battle with Go-Go, a sexy, yet threatening, femme fatale gowned in a schoolgirl uniform, and armed with a lethal ball and chain. <br />Consistently, Quentin Tarantino manages to treat the battles between The Bride and her opponents like a bad pay-per-view Mike Tyson fight: while it is inevitable that The Bride will win, Tarantino unfortunately kills the villains too quickly and pathetically. We want our money back when they're over, you know? The movie's longest battle, which is between The Bride and the Crazy 88 gang (88 isn't just a name, fellahs), is simply too over-the top to warrant our affection. <br />Unfortunately, the more melancholic passages - the best passages -- are relegated to the first half of the film and are never played with again. Maybe the sequel - hopefully the sequel - will trade the over-the-top action sequences found abundant here for more witty dialogue and affecting drama. <br />The film's dull second half is violent, bloody, and just kidding. Lucy Liu stars as one of The Bride's many nemeses and is never really believable. The film ends with a line of dialogue that will influence its entertained viewers to create a time machine to shuttle them straight to the day that volume 2 opens theatrically. For folks like me though, we'll just wait,  patiently, and hope that Tarantino gives us more of the emotionally powerful stuff that made his first installment bearable.
B0000AQZYM|1.0|Melissa Smith, I hate animal violence too. I think that the character Coral is the most beautiful creation in the film and it's really bad that that beautiful creation was killed at the very beginning of the film. Not only does Nemo's mom, Coral die, but his brothers and sisters, Marlin Junior and Coral Junior die too. The only member of Nemo's family that survives is Marlin, his father. This movie has too much animal violence in it. Even more than you say, Melissa Smith. Coral was perhaps the only female creation I like in this movie, any of the others did not look so pretty, like Dory. She is not a cutesie, Coral is, but no other female in this film looks as cute as she. So sad. Disney and Pixar did do better than this, notably Toy Story and A Bug's Life. That crazy old fish ate up Coral and the kids who were going to be Nemo's brothers and sisters and I don't like it. Bad Clown-fish-eating fish.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is in response to pissedhobbit2's review below. Here we have another SNOB with NO ear for music trying to tell the American public what is good taste in music and what is not. You are another one of those jerks who listen to classical music and think that anyone who buys something NOT in the classical music bin has no taste! YOU are the type of person that gives the classical music community a BAD REPUTATION. If you think that &quot;virtually all the contestants on American Idol, Star Search&quot; can sing, then you need to go get your ears checked!! Josh Groban is the MOST incredible vocal talent to come along in DECADES--he blows everyone else out of the water!! And YES, I am a fan of classical music AND I HAVE listened to Bryn Terfel--again, you DEFINITELY need to get your ears checked if you think he is a great singer. He's mediocre at best. Actually, he sounds like he's singing with a stopped-up nose: he has a very nasal sound. Josh, on the other hand, has a pure and beautiful tone to his voice--like no other I have EVER heard in my life!! And he sings with such passion. How you can call his music 'insipid' is beyond my understanding. Actually, I think that you haven't even LISTENED to the CD. So why don't you do yourself a favor and go listen to Closer--and then maybe YOU can develop some good taste in music!!
B000003N7K|5.0|I was disappointed to see that you had taken a part of my review that I wrote on CDNOW.com and spliced it with gloria in dc's review.  I would appreciate you NOT using any part of my writing in that way.  It was I who enjoyed Billy Collins' poetry about Johnny Hartman.  Not Gloria in dc.<br />That doesn't change the fact that this cd contains some of the most romantic and lovely music one could ever enjoy.<br />Rhonda Hampton in Chicago.
0385510438|4.0|This was a very good book. I purchased the audio version and listened to it as I traveled from Houston to Atlanta. Grisham is a masterful storyteller, but I think we all agree with that. <br />This book is a social commentary on Small Town, USA and gives one vivid images to nibble on. Who among us can't see Clanton, Missippi or these characters? Like another reviewer, Mr. Grisham could do us all a favor by giving Harry Rex, Judge Noose, and Rufus Buckley more page time. However, I, too, was a little perplexed why it was called the The Last Juror. Maybe someone much more analytical than I can answer that. <br />What Grisham does better than almost anyone else is give us characters we love. Willie is likeable and you want him to succeed. Lucien is a shark and you want to hate him. Harry Rex is...Harry Rex. Danny Padget is a murderer and you want him to fry. The Ruffins are a loving family and Willie might as well be considered the ninth Ruffin(Aside a little confused about the Sam story, Could have been tied up more, but I'm splitting hairs here. Gotta find something to gripe about.) Throughout the novel, minor characters float in to give the book substance. They serve their purpose.<br />I am a Grishamite. I don't love all of his books but I love most of his characters. Next to Baldacci, Pelecanos, and Patterson, he is one of the best. Some of the plots are outlandish and over the top, but that's his perogative. To one interested in a very good book, this one is worth a serious look. Great job, Mr. Grisham.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Cruel intensions is one those films you love or hate. I personally love it. It stars Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair. Phillippe and Gellar play two spoilt, filthy rich stepsiblings living in Manhattan.  Sebastian (Phillippe) and Kathryn (Gellar) bet whether or not Sebastian can seduce sweet and innocent Annette (Witherspoon). Phillippe shines as the charmingly wicked Sebastian, Witherspoon gives a great performance as sweet Annette, but the Gellar stands out as the evil, manipulating Kathryn. A plot and story with a few twists and turns and good enough to watch again and again.
0385504209|2.0|Rip-roaring good read for the beach or any particularly brainless day. It's entertaining, but the characters are cardboard, the history and &quot;facts&quot; utter crap, and - the worst sin of all - I consistently figured out the next &quot;twist&quot; in the mystery long before the characters did, which made for a lot of impatient waiting for the characters to get around to figuring things out. Nothing worse than an utterly predictably plot &quot;twist.&quot; (Also, do these people never sleep? Maybe that's why they're so dumb ... they run for like five days with no discernable breaks and a bizarrely distorted time-scale.)<br />Enjoyed it, but don't particularly reccommend it. And keep it away from any historians, theologians, or art scholars you know - it'll only make them crazy with all its invented facts.
B000088E6D|5.0|this album hits the proverbial home run. really really fun and easy and enjoyable. the takes on the songs are better than the first versions done years ago. if you love home run hits, this a grandslam
B00005JM0B|5.0|This movie is a lot of intertainment and I have to give credit where it is due. The actors did a superb job and those who question and bash need to make or act their own movies.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Much has been written so I will try to add a new perspective.  This film reminds me of the best work of Eric Rohmer (Summer and Pauline at the Beach, for example) or even the Antoine Doinel films from Truffault.  When the film ended I felt a bit happier about humanity, and made me appreciate the wonders of a strong marriage (mine is 20+ years and still terrific.)   Rohmer. Truffault and Sofia Coppola all love their characters and it shows in every scene.  The result is a movie in which every moment rings true.  Murray and Johansson come across like people in the real world, not like characters in a movie.  And when they do the right thing at the end of the film (we don't know exactly what Murray says, but we know for sure it is the right thing), we realize that we would have done the same, because deep down that is just how most of us are.  <br />So why do some folks detest this film?  The people I know who didn't like it would also be put off by a Rohmer film.   Nothing happens, except nice people behave like nice people.  Why see a movie when this is all that happens?  For me, it is to think a bit more about ourselves, our relationships, and humanity.  Maybe some folks don't need to think about these things.  But I do, and I relish this film for inspiring warm thoughts.<br />Question:  All the Karaoke tunes are from 1977-1983 -- a musical period that was a bit late for Murray and much too early for Johansson.  Was this on purpose?  And what did it signify?
0385504209|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing.  I'd recommend it to anybody who has the time to sit and read.  You might want to read Angels and Demons(also by Dan Brown) before reading the Da Vinci Code though since it is the beginning of Robert Langdon's story.
0694013889|1.0|my 2 year old just didn't like the book.  she didn't stay interested in it at all.  it was not helpful for us.  it had too many words to read - maybe if you had a older child but for my young one it's just too long
B00005JKNC|2.0|Jim Carrey's got two careers. The comedian and the actor.<BR>Without him, how funny would Mask,Dumb and dumber or Ace Ventura have been ? Still playing funny roles, but maybe less in the absurd, (Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty) he finally showed us how he can excel as a serious character. Man on the moon is in my opinion the best film of his career. The Truman show was also a good performance and I knew that by watching The Majestic, I would again meet the serious Jim Carrey, not the funny.I was  expecting a great act but unfortunately the story didn't make it. Very predictable and an END ssssoooooo boring,and moreso so impossible(like the court scene). I am disappointed. I wonder if this role was a piece of cake for Jim and I ask myself why he chose to play in such a &quot;No storyline&quot; movie.<BR>A mix of Doc Hollywood and for the French cinema fans &quot;Boudu sauve des eaux&quot; , between CLICHES and predictable characters, dialogues and even scenes,you will ask why this flick lasts so long to explain so little a story. The only thing that makes this movie interesting enough is the paranoia and the inquisition regarding Communism that USA practiced over the public individuals, actors, writers and intellectual during this period.
B000063147|5.0|Best A7X CD. On the verge of punk and metal, no band has ever reached this level before. An almost perfect CD.
0385510438|5.0|In my (December 17, 2003) review of &quot;Bleachers&quot;, I claimed that &quot;I'm mildly anticipating John Grisham's next legitimate novel--&quot;The Last Juror&quot;--due early next year.&quot;  In that statement, I should've used the word 'greatly' instead of 'mildly', because Grisham's latest legal-thriller was nothing short of spectacular!  I've never read one of Grisham's full-length novels in one day, but I did with &quot;The Last Juror.&quot;  I bought the copy I have Friday evening (Feb. 6), which I began reading Saturday afternoon (12:30 p.m.) and, pretty much in one sitting, after about twelve hours, finished reading Sunday morning (12:30 a.m.).  I loved this book; I've never given a 5-star rating as part of any book review I've written, but &quot;The Last Juror&quot; could be Grisham's best work to date.  I find that I can't really compare the novel to any of Grisham's previous &quot;legal-thriller&quot; novels; &quot;The Last Juror&quot; seems to be a cut above what he's put out since 1991.  The story was compelling, the plot wasn't as formulaic/predictable, the characters were great; and even Grisham's writing style seemed to have improved (more refreshing and not as boring).  If there are readers who have given up on Grisham, then ol' John deserves a second chance because of &quot;The Last Juror.&quot;<BR>A Must Read!
B00000HYXB|4.0|I'm not a big power metal fan, so I'm not going to bombard this piece with blissful adoration.  I like it, but it's not wonderful, and the 20-second narrative pieces are way overdone.  I understand that it's a concept album, but this has more narration tracks than most CDs have tracks period.  I think I counted twelve.  Other than that, vocalist aside, these guys really know how to play.  The guitars are fast - VERY fast - so speed metal fans will really dig this.  The drumming isn't too shabby, either.  But the thing that stands out the most is definitely the double guitar work.  Even though I'm a bassist, and have never touched a lead guitar (except to look at it), I can definitely say that the riffs they play are not easy, but they make it sound so routine.  They don't OD on distortion or effects, but use them where appropriate.  Hansi Kursch's vocals don't appeal much to me, but then I don't like 80s-metal-style vocals.  Anyway, it's a good concept album about a great tale by Sir Tolkien, but I cannot stress how much more consistent it would've been without all those barely-audible skits.
B000063WDH|2.0|Why is it every album up for review on AMZN has a 4+ feedback level? It's an anomaly of our era I guess. Which makes it all the tougher to discern the true artistic gems from the abundance of turds shat by the corporate oligarchy. These guys have litle to say and it shows. The rifts are half-assed catchy and that is the extent of their offering. Damn, the mediocrity that is heralded as the 2nd coming of Jesus is becoming quite tiring!
B00008H2LB|1.0|This band doesn't deserve to be famous, They don't sing, They don't play well, They don't write good lyrics.<br />They are boring.
B000089CJI|5.0|I just listened to this for the first time and all I have to say is.....wow. Check it out, it's amazing.
B000060P79|1.0|It's a boy band, They were dressed up to look hardcore and put on mtv.<br />This isn't punk, it's pop.<br />Listen to some real music.<br />Don't exploit something you know nothing about.
B00005JME0|5.0|Despite all the negative reviews that THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT has recieved, I decided to check it out last night, and in my opinion, the critics don't know what they're talking about.  This is one good movie!  It never becomes boring or stupid, and it always keeps the viewer to suspense as to what will happen next.  By the way, Kutcher CAN act!  So, definately don't pass this up, don't let the critics fool you, see it soon!
6304765789|4.0|&quot;The Game&quot; stars Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy San Francisco investment banker staidly running his financial empire.  Nichola's estranged ne'er-do-well brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) presents a birthday gift to 48-year-old Nicholas -- a paid membership to The Game.<br />The Game is a chaotic intervention -- Murphy's Law applied proactively.  Suddenly Nicholas' controlling lifestyle is flooded with annoyances and emergencies including embarrassing restaurant accidents, police encounters, questionable meetings in hotel rooms, armed mercenaries and a taxi ride off a pier into San Francisco Bay.  Friends and associates become suspect as The Game drives Nicholas towards financial and personal ruin.<br />Michael Douglas portrays powerful men well and his performance is excellent.  And &quot;The Game&quot; portrays chaotic ruination effectively.  But the 1997 plot of &quot;The Game&quot; is not original.  Dan Ackroyd's film &quot;Trading Places&quot; included a comedic rendition of The Game.  And the television series &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; starring Peter Graves, Martin Land au and Greg Morris had a similar theme -- use chaos to weaken and destroy targeted individuals.  IMO the similarity between &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; suggests an interesting speculation: 'How did the Mission Impossible team stay sharp between Government missions?'
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Total and utter garbage. What a disappointment and waste of time. How the hell could this nonsense receive so much Golden Globe nominations and awards. It must have been very costly.<BR>You would have to be very very boring to watch this.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|Im not a britney fan and i thougth it was gonna be bad....but it was getting good reviews....so i decided to buy it...... i think it is really good. it is not as pop-ish as her previous releases....all the tracks are good...and if u dont get to have the 2 bonus tracks ..its still great!...my favorite tracks are toxic, breathe on me and don't hang up... all of them are great.....so hurry up and buy it!!!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park has the tightest beats, no doubt about it.  However, the emo rapping just destroys some amazing songs.  I am a big fan of hip-hop, and let's be honest, Linkin Park is not rap.  The little dweeby kid who talks about &quot;erasing his pain&quot; should be kicked out of the group so that people above the age of fifteen can also enjoy these ridiculously good beats.  The guitars are sick.  Amazing drum loops.  Every track starts off being better than the next, but then here comes malibu's most wanted rapping about his painful existence.  His existence is painful to my ears.  Check out the song with no words, (I think it is eleven or twelve) that and numb are the two best songs on the cd because that moron doesn't get to ruin them.  If there is a cd that is just the instrumentals, I would definitely get that instead.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Many say that this movie is a rip off of the matrix, 1984, and all those others. Sure, it is simular to them, but not a rip off. Most of those people also seem to think that the matrix is an original idea. Don't want to dissapoint them, but it isn't. What about dark city. I only say that to make the point that the matrix isn't really all that great; if you go by these standards.<br />I thought this was a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes action. The plot is simular to 1984, which in my opinion is good, I loved that book, and this movie does it no shame. Give it a chance, I would say 8 out of 10 people would love it.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. Not only kids but also adults can enjoy this movie. It teaches values such as friendship, duty, honour, fighting for a just cause the circle of life, respect for all creatures I could go on and on. Good POSITIVE stuff.<br />The children will watch it over and over again. The bonus interactive animal games are really quite clever and give lots of fun as well. Additionally, the music video was done well.<br />All in all, this DVD gives crisp clean animation with superb sound!<br />And it comes with the original and &quot;enhanced' versions of the Lion King. AT first I couldn't tell the difference. :) However, there is a difference.  The option to have the words to the songs on screen is absolutely brilliant. Not only can the little ones read and sing along but the adults can too!<br />This is a classic DVD that well deserves its place in your DVD collection! Buy TWO and give one to a FRIEND.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|The first thing that struck me about 'Lost in Translation' was the fact that the whole film focuses on 'THE moment', and at that, it is startingly thought-provoking. The moment of intercultural interaction struggle, when you don't know whether to feel amused, upset or uncomfortable. The moment of utter alienation, when, explosively, you get away from everyday problems and get immersed into the unknown. The moment of reflection. The moment of reciprocal appreciation between two beings. <BR>Two despondent Americans are passing time in Japan - the middle-aged man (Murray) is working on an international photo-shoot, and the young woman (Johansson)is married to an erratic photographer and is deciding what she wants from her life. They meet one night at the bar, and talk, about nothing, yet what immediately unites them is a mutual strive for self-fulfillment, the lack of which is accentuated in a faraway city filled with so many unique traditions. Intoxicated by the radical diversity, and spellbound by each other's company, the two characters go through a revelatory redemption.<BR> Simplicity is the key in this contemplative motion picture, wrongly advertised as a comedy (neither is it a 'modern day Lolita). 'Lost in Translation' does have its share of hilarity, most apparent in scenes of Bill Murray trying to communicate with the various directors, talk show hosts and karaoke singers. While slightly astounded by the militant ethnic disparity, Bill Murray is never offensive in his reactions to frankly eccentric individuals - he is flabbergasted by it. In truth, the film is about its two protagonists, suspended in vacuum, face-to-face with disaffection. As genuine as Copolla's sensible, minimalist approach is, their attraction cannot be described as sexual- it's candidly longing, and hence the age difference is neglected.  There is little dialogue, little action, little plot - but we confront and go along with the movie, because it efficiently discovers a tone that swathesus.<BR> Believe the hype - you will fall in love with the marvelous Murray, gorgeous Johannson and candor of this simple yet tremendously heartwarming, truly magical film.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|This is probably the best science fiction series ever produced even though there are only 14 Episodes.<br />I have bought one copy of the DVD for myself and another for my Dad and we have both been blown away.  Its such a weird mixs having both elements of western and science fiction, but some how it just works.  The dialogue is funny, and fun without becoming tacky or cringe worthy.<br />If you feel let down by the volume of rubbish that studios produce these days... buy this and remind yourself what it is like to enjoy something special.
B0000024LN|4.0|Throughout his career, Redman has never got the respect that he really deserves. He has always been overshadowed by Method Man, and sure, Meth is a very good emcee, but Redman can spit just as well, and his many solid albums have proved that. Muddy Waters demonstrates Redman's ability to make you both drop your jaw when he spits some ill lines, and also to laugh. Red has a unique style that can only really be described as funky. The beats on this album are tight, and Red complements them with good lyrics, aand the guests also drop some nice verses. The only problem I have with this album is the large amount of skits. Some of them are pretty funny, but if he took all of them off the album I wouldn't have any complaints.<br />My 3 Favorite Tracks:<br />Rock The Spot<BR>Smoke Buddah<BR>Pick It Up
B00009ZYC1|1.0|This movie is totally lame. The plot is cute, but the animation and the overall appearance of the characters is terrible! The humor in here is cheesy, slightly obscene (to little ears) at times. It is hard to buy the Matrix-inspired action and the modern-day vulgar humor. There is nothing reedeming about the plot or the movie itself. SERIOUSLY, don't buy this.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I can't describe how good this movie made me feel. I genuinely cried, laughed hard out loud and felt my heart break time and time only to be lifted up with the resilience of the lead characters. I thought it would be difficult to follow about 12 lead characters, but it was beautifully woven together. I positively CANT WAIT for the DVD to come out. I have seen it 3 times in the theater and am searching for a theater that still has it playing... Don't miss this movie - even the guys will love it! Guaranteed not just a chick flick.
B00003CXB4|4.0|This movie is great! It is full of action and charisma, with enough humor and realism to keep it from getting too overly sentimental, like many Disney movies. Although the emotions tend to get way too human and serious at times, this movie is great. After Simba is exiled, he finds his home with Timon and Pumba, a meerecat and a pig, also outcasts. It isn't until he's grown up that he goes back. A few strange twists follow, making it slightly unpredictable if you haven't seen the movie before, but I won't spoil it. The animation, the colors, the characters, and the jokes are all top notch and guaranteed to please! It shows the beauty and fragility of Nature also, especially with the main support of the film, the Circle of Life. Reason for four stars: the overly human emotions.
B0001CNRS4|4.0|I was told, many years ago, that if one did not have anything nice to say, one should say nothing at all.  Can anyone imagine that rule being followed on Amazon?  The board would be empty, pretty much.  The problems with \\"honey\\" stick out like very sore thumbs, one can see every blemish during the previews, even on the poster.  It seems the pretty young idealist from New York, I think it's New York, the film credits say Canada, a really urban Canada perhaps, teaches hip hop at \\"The Center\\", you know, one of those lovable, grimy city dwellings that cater to talented, racially diverse groups of young people who just gotta dance.  Good thing too, because if ya don't dance in \\"The hood\\" ya gonna get \\"dusted\\" or Smoked\\" or whatever.  There is only one way out kids, sing, dance and dance some more, if you are very lucky the local idealist hottie will be teaching the \\"Moves\\".  The hottie in question is, debatably, the hottest hottie in all of Hottietown ( I don't know if this is Hottietown USA or Canada, it really doesn't matter).  Jessica Alba is best known as the Sci Fi Hottie on \\"Dark Angel\\", I never saw the show, but I certainly saw Ms. Alba in the magazine ads and the \\"Got Milk\\" ads.  Damn she's hot.  Really hot.  But this is the movies and so on we go with the endless roll call of Hollywood clichés, got a paper and pencil?, let's have the roll call.<br />1.  Drop dead beautiful idealistic young hottie (I know that's redundant and I don't care)<BR>2.  Group of adorable scamps who are going to wind up in jail or the NBA of they don't get there big break dancing, singing, whatever.<BR>3.  Evil rich guy who wants to A.  Tear down the beloved building where the crucial practice take place.  B, seduce and destroy innocent hottie for his own nefarious purposes.  C.  Seduce and destroy adorable scamps recruiting them to a life of crime and bad dance numbers.<BR>4.  Colorful local characters with hearts of gold, sassy girlfriends, lovable barber and numerous characters recycled from \\"The Jefferson's\\" and \\"That's My Mamma\\" (yes I am that old, and who asked you anyway?)<BR>5.  Cliffhanger scenario where all will be lost if some large amounts of money are not raised just in time.<BR>6.  And of course the evil \\"other dancer\\" who seems ready to take Honey's spot when Honey refuses to do the casting couch hustle with the evil rich guy.<BR>They used every toy in the box.  Albas mother, a retired hottie, has noble ideas for her daughter, but is clueless as can be, at one point she actually says \\"You are 22 years old...you don't know what you want\\", to there credit, no one in the cast burst out laughing, the same cannot be said for the audience.  As the time is running out and the noble Alba is faced with certain ruin if she can't come up with the cash, she is forced to resort to desperate means to raise the funds.  I promise I won't give away the ending.  Let's just say that it involves lots of adorable scamps handing out leaflets with the word \\"Benefit\\" on them, and the noble barber comes across with a place to perform (there were no barns available I guess), oh yeah and what movie like this would be complete without the established \\"big Star\\" coming to the rescue at the end.  Anyone old enough to remember the Brady Bunch TV show will know that like Davey Jones, of the monkees fame, another celebrity with a big heart and a big name will suddenly;y materialize and save the day.  Missy Eliot steals every scene she's in, she is easily the best part of this film, telling the evil dancer to \\"call MC Hammer and tell him you been stealing his moves\\"  Ha Ha Ha, that never gets old.  She could have said \\"Vanilla Ice\\" too, that would have been better, I think.  But like in days of yore the lovable, energetic cast give it all they've got.  They do handsprings and twirl around a lot and dance there little hearts out, gee I wonder if, in the end, Honey will triumph, and the new center will stay and \\"lil Romeo will see that the \\"home boys\\" he thought \\"hadhis back\\" were really just \\"wack\\" after all and will there be a lotta dancin and smilin during the end credits?  I promised I wouldn't give away the ending and I won't.  It would be easy to be critical of this film for the very same reason it should be praised.  Given a choice I prefer that the glass be half full then empty.  Even if we have seen this cornball story told a hundred times, there is always a generation of PG13 young people who will want to know that you don't have to sleep with someone to get ahead (it doesn't hurt to wear tiny tank tops that look like they were painted on though)that crime really does not pay, that people can overcome adversity (as long as they look really really hot and can dance).  So what if we've seen it, perhaps some other people haven't, this will never go out of style and perhaps it never should.
0780020685|5.0|Truly one of the greatest movies ever made. Akira Kurosawa has created a masterpiece which develops its characters with so much depth that anybody can connect with any one of them. Unlike many of the horrible movies released nowadays, this movie uses only the natural elements available and makes for classic battle sequences that will never be forgotten. If you enjoy good movies then watching Seven Samurai would be a great choice.  Anybody who gives this movie 1 star shouldn't be taken seriously, this movie deserves far more stars than one could give it.
B0000399WI|5.0|This film recounts the life experience of every decent man in the Western hemisphere. Man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains, like Rousseau said. In adult life he gets ensnared into a system built on lies, injustice, chicanery, and is subjected to thugs, kommissars, bureaucrats, crooks and jerks. If he is lucky, he finds a good friend. By learning to play the system he can survive, and develop a plan to get himself out. With patience and durability he racks up a nest-egg for himself at the end of the tunnel. Sweet revenge is seldom there ---- in this the film departs from reality. Finally he can retire for a few years of pleasant life in the sun by the sea. The story is meticulously crafted, supremely well-acted and directed. It's a bit like Charley Varrick. Uplifting.
B00000J7J4|2.0|I've been a Santana fan ever since I was turned on to them in 1984 and consider Carlos & Co (and the various permutations of the band) one of my all-time favorite atrists.  I was disappointed with SUPERNATURAL from the moment I listened to it.  There is little on this album that is not re-manufactured pop, and it in no way highlights the exceptional musicianship or band interplay that Santana is known for.  Songs like \\"Maria, Maria\\" and \\"Turn Your Lights On\\" are about as far from the classic Santana sound as one can get, and the entire collection of songs has the tired \\"let's-try-to-write-a-hit-single-and-make-some-big-money\\" kind of feel.  <br />If you are seeking Santana at their pop best, check out \\"Zebop\\" or Beyond Appearances\\" instead.  If you want Santana at their very best, buy the first three albums and the \\"LOTUS\\" live album as each of these four are masterpieces.  Avoid SUPERNATURAL.
B000005KQT|5.0|If you're into blues harp there's no better.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie is terribly condescending to Japan and its people.  Exactly what is the movie about?  Its certainly not about understanding other cultures and showing respect for them.  It looked more like about a lonely married American in a weird county and the only person he can truly connect to just happens to be a fellow married American staying at the same hotel who drinks like a lout and lives in her underwear. I hardly think this movie would be embraced by American film-goers if it was shot with the same screenplay, same director, same cast but under the premise of a European actor coming to Hollywood to shoot a commercial.  How would Americans feel if this actor walked into an elevator with a bunch of morbidly obese people stuffing french fries in their mouth?  Its this type of movie that cements stereotypes into people's head.  Sophia Coppola is a racist.  I hope the Academy does not honor her and this film. It is one thing to make fun of yourself but to ridicule and mock and entire nation on a global scale is demeaning and cruel. It is no wonder that Americans are hated around the world.
B00005JLEX|5.0|First of all, my Five Star rating is for the series since the DVD itself is not released yet.  I have read that the delayed release date is due to the fact that Jason Alexander, Michael Richards and Julia Dreyfuss are refusing to do the commentaries for the episodes.  Apparently if they do the commentary they will be getting a one time check vs. any sales profits.  I say please find a happy medium and one soon.  I am very impressed at the Friends Franchise.  Every 3 months they are releasing a new season on DVD.  Friends is in season 10 and they have already come out with seasons 1-6.   Anywho, Seinfeld is a top notch show that I find and turn on everytime I want a sure fire laugh.  Even though I know exactly how it's going to end or how the characters are going to react I still have to laugh...
B0001BKAEY|3.0|This film is the wrap-up for the two-film \\"trilogy\\" that is the Matrix. You can't pull the last two films apart, while you could, theoretically, have stopped watching after the first film. <BR><br />I can say only this - if you haven't seen the film, it's worth seeing. If you have and you thought the Matrix ultimately fell apart into \\"psychobabble\\" and bad acting, but lots of pretty pictures, fine. The question then becomes, what else did you expect? The public flocked to see the last two Star Wars films, even though they were drivel. If you got sucked in by the hype and spent money, TWICE to see garbage, you deserve to get sucked in again. Studios are not very smart, but they know what sells. You can't blame them or the Wachowski brothers for giving the public the trash they ask for. <BR><br />Me? I liked the film. There was a lot going on in the little bits that were hard to catch, until I'd watched the film 5-6 times. It does hold up well to repeat viewings, especially with the killer soundtrack. I will miss Morpheus and Trinity. Neo was Nemo, as far as I'm concerned.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like most people, I Never saw an episode while it was on TV.  Blame the utter morons at Fox for once again, killing an excellent series with ineptitude in marketing it.  <br />Firefly is the perfect series- I have a mild interest in sci-fi (ie I never watched Babylon 5 or Farscape but enjoy sci-fi in fiction and occasionally on film) but the series shines in its character development- each member of the crew of the Sernenity is so fully realized that as the last episode of disc 4 ended, it was like realizing you'd never see some old friends again.  There was not one weak performance with special kudos to Runora (sp the companiion) who is beautilful and amazing and the doctor, who truly grows as a character during the course of the series.  And the captain is a wonderful character, pulled staight out of the old west.<br />Somebody should pick up this series- Sci-fi would have a HUGE hit on its hands.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is the best romantic comedy that I have seen in a long time.  From start to finish it is simply one of the best.  By the movie's end you will be high on life and ready to take on the world.  This movie combines several different love stories in a seamless fashion.  It is very unique and enduring.  It is an instant treasure.  You will view love differently after watching this film.  I know this sounds very cheesy, but you will have to take my word for it!  This film redefines how a romantic comedy should be made.  They broke the mold when they made this film!
0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi is a captivating story - so wonderfully entertaining!  The main character is a spiritual, deep thinking teenage boy from India, whose simple life as the son of a zookeeper is turned upside down after he becomes a survivor of a sunken ship at sea. There a suttle lessons learned throughout the storytelling, which the author is expert at weaving in between the lines. The end of the story lends a surprising, profound twist - both unusually humorous and thought provoking.  After finishing this book, it has become clear to me that a simple life can be a satisfying and meaningful life as long as the spirit is focused on what is good. A great piece of literature - I highly recommend it!

0385504209|4.0|What's great about this book is that it is loaded with quality historic research and conspiracy theories that make you start to wonder about things you never thought of before!  This is the kind of novel that gets the intelligent person hooked and keeps them up all hours of the night just to find out what's going to happen next! I don't read a lot of novels, but this one is smart, exciting and just a lot of fun! A must read for those interested in The Holy Grail.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this is an awesome cd but i still do think that hybrid theory wuz better <br />best songs are:<BR>somewhere i belong<BR>lying from you<BR>breaking the habit
B00006AG5N|5.0|What can be said about Elvis that has not already been said.  This fine collection of songs is a pop music history book.  The remastered sound brings these classics into the year 2004.  It has sold over 8 million copies because it is truly extraordinary.
B00004Z459|5.0|this is an awesome cd no matter what anybody says!<br />best songs:<BR>papercut<BR>one step closer<BR>with you<BR>by myself<BR>pushing me away
B0000CFW87|5.0|If you haven't heard Josh Groban sing, then you are missing out!<br />An amazing voice, amazing songs, not a single track that misses a beat. Truly inspired, amazing, and uplifting!  Take this into the bath with candles, close your eyes and just BE....

B00004XPP0|1.0|So I hear that the original Star Wars Trilogy will finally be released on DVD this October. It's about time Lucus stopped being such a weenie! :)<br />However... I hear that the versions on the DVDs will be the 20th anniversary &quot;Special Editions,&quot; with all the computer-generated extra stuff. I don't know about you, but I want the &quot;original theatrical&quot; widescreen versions. I mean, you can enhance the picture quality if you want to, or treat the sound to some THX love, but don't add the other stupid things to the movie we all love!<br />I will NOT buy the DVDs if this is the version they release. If you want to have BOTH versions of each film in the set, like they just did with the Aliens series, then that would be perfect, but please, please, please -don't omit the theatrical versions!<br />-A concerned fan.
B00005NWM3|4.0|its really good no matter what ppl say! i guess you have to make your own decision but i have to say this its great! not the full 5 stars because it was played too much but its really worth the money this is a great cd
B000002OTL|4.0|Oh well, nearly every track. I recognise about half of the tracks on this.<br />There's lots of snippets of dialogue from the movie to start some of the tracks, so you know exactly where they appear in the movie. However, only a couple of these tracks are introduced like this - those being &quot;Misirlou&quot;; &quot;Bullwinkle Part II&quot;; &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;; and &quot;Comanche&quot;. Personally, I couldn't recognise these tracks by THOSE names if I tried - but if I were to tell you: &quot;Pumpkin &amp; Honey Bunny&quot;; &quot;Royale With Cheese&quot;; &quot;Zed's Dead, Baby&quot;; &quot;Jack Rabbit Slims Twist Contest&quot;; and &quot;Bring Out The Gimp, then you're clicking your fingers in recognition right? (Every one but the last one!) Some of the dialogue snippets are pretty much pointless. They need to be short and quick, and some of them are just too long, and you're desperate for the music to start playing.<br />For anyone who would like to hear Samuel L. Jackson's infamous quote, just before he's going to kill someone, the last track of this is a must for you!  (Ezekiel 25:17) Go ahead and learn it off by heart, and then you can spout it to anyone you wish - and scare them witless.<br />One of the greatest songs on this has to be &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; by Al Green. This was also featured in Down To You, but ISN'T for some strange reason on the soundtrack to that. (The song that Julia Stiles sings to Freddie Prinz Jnr in the college room)<br />I was not expecting to find a song by Maria McKee on this! But as with most soundtracks, there is normally a whole mixture of tunes thrown haphazardly in and normally none of them will match!<br />A great soundtrack to match a great film, and is a definite must-have for any soundtrack fan, or anyone who can't find certain songs on any other CD - this will have them.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I just finished watching this movie, which I bought on the strength of my friends' critiques. I must say that this is definitely one of the more unique movies I have seen in a long time, and were it not for his past in Hollywood, Bill Murray would win an Oscar for Best Actor. No lying--I just ACTUALLY typed that.<br />This is easily Murray's greatest performance. His look of apathy and off-the-cuff commentary are somewhat subdued in this movie, which gives his character (Bob, the washed-up actor) a geniune feel. He is also able to convey Bob's loneliness very easily. The moviegoers KNOW that Bob is a defeated and lonely man: even while on vacation, he is constantly bothered by his wife (whom he no longer loves), and his washed-up career further adds to his dismal situation. One of the more intriguing characters in cinema the last couple of years. <br />Johansson is delightful in this movie. She gives an undeniably good performance here, but what sold me on her was her way with little things, especially facial expressions (a hint of a smile or a biting of her lip add depth to her character). The scenes that require her to actually ACT (the solo scenes in her apartment or her wandering thru Tokyo) are also well-done. She sold me on her character by simply becoming her: as she lies in bed with Murray, you can sense the feeling of uneasiness and isolation in her. She's worried about her future, but she is not alone--Murray, and the rest of us, understand and share her feelings.<br />Coppola - who directed this with an intriguing focus on environment - has a great movie on her hands. She has little more than a hotel and two characters to work with--but she somehow manages to make it interesting. &quot;A viewer&quot; said this movie was boring, but I must disagree with him/her: the viewer is sold on both characters from the moment they see them, and this keeps the viewer enthralled. One can sense a feeling of warmth and caring beneath Bob's weathered exterior, and Charlotte, as a friend said, has a &quot;girl next door&quot; appeal to her--but in no way does she come off as naive. These are both easy sells for the viewer--a fact which can be attributed to Coppola's ability to develop the characters in a minimalist fashion.<br />So to conclude, the acting is superb (Johannson and Murray are wonderful in their roles) and the directing is just as good. It also has its funny moments, but its usually serious. Somehow, Coppola was able to take a foreign hotel and two characters and make it entertaining. And thats where the charm of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; lies: while the message is understood by all and the movie is no grand production, it resonates with the audience on a level that few other movies have.
B000006MV8|5.0|Additional comments on the 2010 reissue.<br /><br />It was great news that Apple decided to reissue their four Badfinger albums and give them a remastering. The first CD release of \\"Straight Up\\" dates back to 1993, and although the sound on the old release was great, this is a clear improvement.<br /><br />The number of bonus tracks is the same, but it must be noted that four of them are different. These come from the originally unreleased Geoff Emerick produced follow-up album to \\"No Dice\\" from late 1970. This album has never been released in its entirety. But with the previously unreleased bonus-track on this release, along with the digital download only version of \\"Sweet Tuesday Morning\\" it is now possible to compile your own version of that album. A great sham that the album was never released, as it would really have been a great album, that might have secured Badfinger even more recognition.<br /><br />The long period between the releases of \\"No Dice\\" and \\"Straight Up\\" did not help the band sustain their popularity, so when the group finally did release \\"Straight Up\\" around new year 1972, they more or less had to start over again. They did manage to return to the charts with the two great singles from \\"Straight Up\\", \\"Day After Day\\" and \\"Baby Blue\\", but bad management meant that their succes more or less ended there; but that's another story.<br /><br />Actually among the bonus-tracks you'll find two great singles that never were. Both were stronly considered; \\"Name of the Game\\" even was given catalog number in both the U.K. and in the U.S. ( Apple 35 / Apple 1833 ).  \\"Name of the Game\\" is one of Pete Ham's very best songs, which really deserves recognition as a classic. \\"I'll Be the One\\" wasn't even released until 1993, which is just as sad, as it's an extremely cacthy song that captures the folky trends of the time, and has a feel very much like that of early Lindisfarne.<br /><br />Three of the bonus-track are released here for the first time ever. They're all great additions to the Badfinger song catalog, and deserve a few comments each.<br /><br />The legendary unreleased Pete Ham song \\"Baby Please\\" is actually a group composition, but clearly with Pete Ham in the lead. Pete sings this great boogie-rocker and also delivers some great lead-guitar. A song worthy of Status Qou.<br /><br />Tom Evans' \\"No Good at All\\" is a straight forward blues-rocker, with great vocals from Tom and some great slide guitar from Pete Ham.<br /><br />\\"Sing for the Song\\", also written by Tom Evans\\", is probably the strongest composition of the three. Unbelieveable that it wasn't released at the time. Apple really did a bad job there, missing potential hit-songs and shelving first class material. \\"Sing for the Song\\" is a Beatles-influenced, very much in the vein of the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" approach. Note that this time Pete Ham excels at the piano.<br /><br />By the way the track-listing of the unreleased 1971 album is supposed to have been like this:<br /><br />Side One: Suitcase ( Molland) / I'll Be the One (Badfinger) / No Good at All (Evans) / Sweet Tuesday Morning (Molland) / Baby Please ( Ham/Gibbins/Molland) / Mean, Mean Jemima (Molland) // Side Two: Name of the Game (Ham) / Loving You (Gibbins) / / Money (Evans) / Flying (Evans/Molland) / Sing for the Song (Evans) / Perfection (Ham) - An an that really deserve an official release in its entirety.<br /><br />There are fine and informative liner notes written by Andy Davis. A strongly recommended release.<br /><br />By the end of 1971 Badfinger had actually recorded two albums since the release of \\"No Dice\\". The first remains unreleased to this date!. The second was released in February 1972 ( a bit earlier in the USA ), and was titled \\"Straight Up\\". Apple did not like the sound of the original album - they wanted a more polished sound. The rejected album had been produced by Geoff Emerick, and in spring 1971 George Harrison expressed wish to produce the band. Of course this was an offer that could not be rejected. George finished 4 tracks before he had to pull out to work on the Bangla Desh concert . To finish the album Todd Rundgren was recruited. Rundgren went through the recordings done with Emerick and Harrison and did some remixing on some of the tracks. Furthermore 7 new recordings were done for the album, which ended up to be Badfinger's most \\"produced\\" album - maybe along with \\"Wish You Were Here\\" - and it's indisputably among their finest.  This album is one of their best loved, and it ranks among the greatest albums to come out of the seventies.<br /><br />Pete Ham is the main contributor of songs to the album. His 5 songs on the album are all among his greatest. The two hits, \\"Day After Day\\" and \\"Baby Blue\\" are well-known ,and \\"Take it All\\", \\"Name of The Game\\" and \\"Perfection\\" are all stand out tracks. Tom Evans wrote \\"Money\\" and \\"It's Over\\" - the latter considered by many to be one of his greatest with Badfinger. Molland wrote the acoustic ballad \\"Sweet Tuesday Morning\\" \\"I'd Die Babe\\" ( an optimistic country styled George Harrison production ) and the two rockers \\"Suitcase\\" and \\"Sometimes\\" - both became part of Badfinger's standard concert repertoire. The album is very well produced by Rundgren/Harrison - a bit overproduced at times, some might say. The bonus-tracks are all excellent - Name of The Game and Perfection even better than the album-versions.<br /><br />My favourites: Take it All, Baby Blue, Name of The Game (both versions), Day After Day, Perfection and It's Overon the Bangla Desh concert .

B00013RC8O|5.0|You may need to be over 40 to appreciate the social contrasts of American life in 1971 and today.  In April of that year an estimated 500,000 Americans were in Washington DC protesting against our involvement in Vietnam.  Howard Hughes was still living; NASA sent a probe to Mars while the crew of Apollo 15 was riding for the first time in the Lunar Rover.  Charles Manson and `family' were found guilty for the murder of Sharon Tate.  The U.A.E. (United Arab Emirates) was formed this year, so was the Libertarian party in the USA.  The Concord SST was doing flight tests, Intel announced their 4004 chip, and the movie Vanishing Point began showing in our local movie houses.<br />The star of the movie is not the '70 Dodge Challenger; rather the star is the freedom the car and its driver are trying to attain through speed, and ultimately death.  Most of us never know when we'll die, yet the character Kowalski seems to have one up on us.  He has been running through life's trials like questions with multiple choice answers, eliminating the obvious wrong answers first.<br />The vast open spaces the cinematography so wonderfully capture frame the path to the Pearly Gates; rather a crack of light between the blades of a couple of CAT dozers that Director Sarafian refers to as a crack in the fence.  Kowalski's soul is about to be set free and the Challenger is just the vehicle that can go fast enough to do it.<br />As Insurance company's rates soared for muscle cars and Emissions standards pummeled high output engines, the whole muscle car era faded to black in a few years.  The movie Vanishing Point is a time machine - the beginning of the end.<br />The DVD version is by far my favorite which includes Mr. Sarafian's narration as an option.  I would have loved to have heard Barry Newman and Clevon Little (sadly deceased in 1992), and or some of the crew with Sarafian discuss the making of the film.  There's also a UK version of the film including the cut scenes with Charlotte Rampling (great scene).  This is definitely one to add to your library.  5 Stars in my book.e Rampling (great scene).  This is definitely one to add to your library.  5 Stars in my book.
B00005QAPK|4.0|The best story here is Toby Dammit.  At first I was very annoyed that they overdubbed Terence Stamp's voice with some french actor's voice.  But I think that's only because I'm so used to hearing Stamp's distinctive voice when I see his face.  That soon melted away and I couldn't have enjoyed the story more (although I still think they should have left Stamp's voice alone).  This is actual art on screen.  It's both surreal and intensely real at the same time.  <br />The devil as a little blonde girl freaked me out...  This is another great piece of work from Fellini.  Worth my money.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|A deft blend of neo-soul, funk, quiet storm, and traditional R &amp; B, this is a &quot;diary&quot; worth perusing its &quot;pages&quot;.  Keys shows why she is a &quot;diva&quot; deserving of the title.  There is no filler here, just a seamless blend of great music that is the mark of a true artist, destined for many years of greatness.
B000089RVX|5.0|Another late review, but in time for the Grammys, This is easily my favorite CD this year. It all started with a movie called Daredevil. The two best songs I heard in the film came from the same band! And like many others, buying the soundtrack just wouldn't do. Who was this mega-moody band. Their sound, and my God, the vocals! (by the way, the WWE showcased this band for one of their PPVs before they really made it big).<BR>1. GOING UNDER(A): The verses to this opening track are muttered to a chill that prepares you for the melancholy mayhem to come.<BR>2. BRING ME TO LIFE (A+): This is one of those songs that benchmarks the new millenium. Fresh and hip, agressive, but beautiful. <BR>3. EVERYBODYS FOOL (B+): sound is consistant and in full flow by only the third song! Makes you want to jump around roof tops in the rain.<BR>4. MY IMMORTAL (A+): By now we want to know this chick's name. Because this is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Thanks, Amy.<BR>5. HAUNTED (A+): Lee's vocals get the red carpet treatment on this, the best/scariest song on Fallen- My favorite.<BR>6. TOURNIQUET (A): Riffs are original and just damn good rock. Semi-holy, I need a dark corner for this one.<BR>7. IMAGINARY (A): Strings segue into this orchestral masterpiece. Pianos, guitars, and tears combine for a sensory overload of the mind and soul.<BR>8. TAKING OVER ME (A-): Okay, if the CD ended here it would still be the best one in years. The emotion transends sound. Haunting...<BR>9. HELLO (B-): Taking a break from the suicidal, self- mutilating goth bombarding rock is &quot;Hello&quot;. No, wait- I still wanna do all these things. But to softer music this time.<BR>10. MY LAST BREATH (A-): The disc is coming to an end. I'm scared. The music is still really deep and messing with my head.<BR>the drum outro is orgasmic, by the way.<BR>11. WHISPER (B): Alot of people like this one, but compared to the others, it's only &quot;eh&quot;. <BR>That's okay though, because the chior we lasthear caps off  the most satisfying listening experience I've had in years. I want Evanescence to play me lulabys. One thing for sure is they do 2 things well: Bridges (all of them are awesome), and Goth. All i see when I hear their stuff are vampires fighting. In the rain...

0553277472|5.0|I am suprised at how many people that I have run into who have said that this book has changed their lives.  Well, you can chalk up another changed life convert in me.  After reading it eight times I lost track of the subsequent number of reads.  It seems as if it just gets deeper and deeper with each read.  My whole outlook on purpose and meaning in life has been slightly changed after thinking and pondering this book over the last three years; and in a good way.  Take up the challenge of this book and see what all the fuss is about.  I mean this book has its own online philosophy chat room/website dedicated to the real zealots of the cause! ([...])  I imagine if you look hard enough you will even find a Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance church somewhere.
B0001FI43O|3.0|I was impressed by the diffence in family values. They seemed<br />to join in many  ways.  yet, the  families are the same . Both the uncle and the nephew needed to love each other for many reasons.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I first heard of Gavin DeGraw when I saw a preview for the WB's &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;.  I heard the theme song &quot;I Don't Wanna Be&quot; and instantly looked up the artist who sang the song.  I became hooked on the song and the CD.  It was the only CD I listen to for weeks.  It is a great alternative CD and DeGraw is a REAL artist, unlike some mainstream pop artists.  Chariot starts off with a great song and ends perfectly.<br />1. Follow Through: 9/10 - An excellent way to begin the CD.<BR>2. Chariot: 9/10 - Also a good song, great lyrics. <BR>3. Just Friends: 8.5/10 - More of a ballad, anyone who has been cheated on can definitely relate to this song.  <BR>4. Nice To Meet You Anyway: 8/10 - This song is okay, but it has good lyrics. <BR>5. Chemical Party: 9/10 - A great song with a good beat.<BR>6. Belief: 8/10 - Another ballad, not one of my favorites, but nothing is bad on this album.  <BR>7. Crush: 7.5/10 - Good chorus, but just an alright song.   <BR>8. I Don't Wanna Be: 11/10 - My FAVORITE song on the album and of the year.  Great lyrics, great beat, there's nothing more I can say about it.  It's one of those songs that gives you goose bumps when you listen to it.<BR>9. Meaning: 9/10 - A truly great ballad with beautiful lyrics &quot;Love has a reason, there's a meaning to the world. We're giving love&quot;.<BR>10. More Than Anyone: 10/10 - Another one of my favorites on the CD. It is a great ballad and has more piano than other songs on Chariot.  Great lyrics for people who are in love.  <BR>11. Overrated: 9/10 - Good ending to a great CD.
B00005AAFS|2.0|I'm 99% sure that all of the reviews written about this CD, so far, are by fans that want to rant and rave about how wonderful it is. And I will agree, it is a wonderful CD, with many great qualities. Even if one can't understand the german lyrics, he could probably infer what is being said. This is because the band's music does such a great job of imagery. Imagery in the sense that one can easily understand the military theme in \\"Links 2, 3, 4\\" from the marching feet and the obvious marching chant. The same goes for the sexual overtones in \\"Rein, Rous\\" [sic]. The melodies are artistic, and far from conventional rock, though this is superficially deceptive.<br />However, I believe this album is far from perfect, and deserves a little devil's advocation after all the great reviews it's gotten. Keeping with the tradition set forth in it's past albums, \\"Mutter\\" delivers very similar palm muted rhythms with similar melodies. While being incredibly catchy, there's very little diversion from this insular method of composition. It's almost as though you were listening to a variation on the same song over, and over, and over... etc. Also, each song seems to follow a strict \\"Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus.\\"<br />Nevertheless, this CD probably deserves 4 stars, though I find it necessary to address these major errors that have been overlooked by many of the other reviewers.
0385512104|5.0|&quot;Curious Incident&quot; is one of the best novels I've come across in awhile. Mysterious, quirky, painful and revealing, it's a masterful debut by a new writer, hopefully the first of many.<BR> <BR>In this novel Haddon takes on the challenge of viewing the world from the perspective of a 15 year old autistic boy, although being truly faithful to his first person narrative, the word &quot;autism,&quot; and the concept of disability never really appear in the book. Rather, Christopher has been told he has &quot;behavioral problems,&quot; and in his methodical way, relying on his photographic memory, he lists them--one for each letter of the alphabet. I laughed out loud--some of them --&quot;I don't like being touched by strangers&quot;--anyone could relate to!<br />One evening Christopher finds that his neighbor's dog has been killed in a rather gruesome way, and despite being warned off by his neighbors and forbidden to pursue it by his father, Christopher resolves to solve the mystery. <br />Along the way we get a first hand look at Christopher's world, which is terrifying in its variety and chaos, and we see the disorder of it all through his own eyes. Christopher believes that if he sees red cars on the way to school, it will be a good day; if he sees yellow, a bad day. This seems to be his technique for minimizing surprises--he can't deal with the unknown of a new day. Christopher realizes others view this as odd, but he very logically explains that everyone has similar rather illogical ways of starting the day--if it's raining outside many feel it's going to be a bad day, and if it's sunny a good one, even though if you work in an office the weather is fairly irrelevant! Christopher is blessed with a gifted teacher, Siobhan, who guides and encourages him; she has a knack for communicating with him in a very very clear and specific way that he can understand and act on. Has Haddon portrayed someone he knows?--although she has a minor role, the reader can envision her patience and kindness very clearly.<br />Christopher is a mathematical genius, which to the rest of us can be hard to grasp--but he explains the &quot;Monty Hall&quot; problem in a way even English majors can understand. When you come to this part of the book, think about it. Christopher loves the order and logic of math and science; he dreams of being an astronaut, telling us exactly what he would like about it and what the hurdles would be. <br />During the course of solving the mystery of the murder of the dog, Christopher makes an amazing discovery, which leads him to arrempt to go to London on his own, a terrifying journey into the unknown. Christopher minutely plans how to overcome each challenge, from covering his eyes to block out too much visual data, to mentally drawing a line across the train station floor  (in red of course, a good color) and following it to avoid getting confused. Haddon also makes us feel keenly the emotional chaos Christopher's world becomes--his discovery would shatter anyone, and turns upside down the tenuous web of his relationships with the few people he has come to trust.<br />Christopher slowly emerges from the emotional turmoil his life has become, having gained a new measure of confidence from his solo journey to London and his writing of the book about his experiences. I don't know enough about autism to know if people with the disorder can learn and change in this way, but the ending is uplifting nevertheless.<br />I listened to this book on tape (unabridged), and I'd highly recommend it. The reader is a professional, and mimics the lower middle class accent Christopher would have perfectly, as well as convincingly taking on the other characters' parts. It's a great find for a long journey.
0385504209|5.0|Let's start off with flaws. &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; rarely takes time to slow down. The entire 400-something pages happens, for the most part, in less than 18 hours of time. The characters are pretty thin, with very little true analysis and/or dimension. The only exceptions to this are Silas and the Bishop, who receive less of a role in the story than they deserve. For a book that has an endless amount of plot twists, (which some may find to be incessantly mind-numbing after awhile) it seems rather linear in the sense that once you figure out what the real conflict and goal is, it's just straight ahead without too much diversion. There can't be anything very interesting about a book centered around two highly predictable cryptographers and a slew of rather unimportant characters racing towards something that isn't even fully explained until the last third of the book, can there?<br />Well, if you guess &quot;no&quot;, then Dan Brown has proved you wrong. Horribly wrong, in fact. The DaVinci code is so captivating, that many people will not even be able to realize the technical errors that would usually stand out like a sore thumb. Brown makes no attempt to flood the reader with everything at once. Because there is quite a lot to take in. Instead, he uses a rather cheap, but highly effective method, of keeping his audience captivated. You will find, when reading this book, that there are very few places where one can really come to a stop. It's very, very difficult to put the book down and take a break. When finishing one chapter, you will be introduced to an incomplete plot twist, which will remained uncompleted until after 5 more chapters have passed. By that time, you've already been introduced to another twist.<br />Intertwined in this suspense-thriller game of cat and mouse is a thick overtone of cryptography, history, and religious conspiracy, for lack of a better term. This aspect of the story will probably captivate some as much as the thriller aspect. The two main characters are forced through solving code after code, while learning about a historical battle of epic proportions that has remained virtually hidden from the light of common knowledge for all these years.<br />Well, Dan Brown just may have changed that.he two main characters are forced through solving code after code, while learning about a historical battle of epic proportions that has remained virtually hidden from the light of common knowledge for all these years.<br />Well, Dan Brown just may have changed that.

While Marlin and Dory follow his trail, Nemo becomes acquainted with the other fish in the dentist's office tank and learns that he is destined to become a gift for the dreaded \\"fish-killer\\" Darla, the dentist's niece.<br />Though ostensibly a children's film, there is plenty here to engage adults as well.  The computer animation is magnificent; the colors and textures of the seascape and its inhabitants are gorgeous.  The story itself is rather touching and includes many jokes and references that will go right over the heads of little ones but will be appreciated by the adults in the room.

0812932293|5.0|I read this book on a flight en route to London in 1998 and continually refer back to it as a source of brainstorming and inspiration. It is a book that will entertain, educate and encourage all, bit just those with a mind for business. Every page is full of humourous &quot;Nransonesque&quot; anecdotes and life experiences. A must read!
0440418569|5.0|I was thoroughly captivated with Lyra and Will's quest in the Subtle Knife.  How can one not be, with the forces of uncounted worlds bearing down on two lost children.  At stake is not only their lives, but the life of everyone who is now living, and the soul of everyone who once lived.  There are plots within plots, power and betrayal, lies and love and through all of these currents drift Lyra and Will, who incredibly try to ignore all of this and do what they know to be right.<br />Pullman creates love and brings it out in many forms, and with it some sadness and loss.  I couldn't imagine how he could pull all of the different stories together and tie them up, but he manages without ever being untrue to his characters.  Thinking of some parts still threaten to bring tears, but there is also so much happiness.<br />Adults everywhere should be giving these books to their children, and sneaking them back to read at night.  There's more wonder and delight here than in all of the Harry Potter books, and more humanity than Rowling will likely ever write.  This is the series that we should be talking about.
0385510438|2.0|John Grisham returns and shows us why he's the most popular American writer ever with &quot;The Last Juror.&quot;  The book is filled with colorful people from fictional Ford County Mississippi; learning more about each one is a delight.  After three less than exceptional books that left me a little disheartened, Grisham returns to the place where his books started, the setting of the great &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot;  In this book, though, the main character Willie Traynor befriends a sixty-year-old black mother of eight in 1970.  That year, the town was rocked by the brutal death of Rhoda Kasselaw; and Traynor, as newspaper editor, was set to benefit from the sensational details.<br />Grisham is highly adept at character development and keeps the reader interested in and caring for each colorful character.  Don't miss the ending!  Welcome back, John.

0345409671|2.0|I think I was fourteen-years-old when I realized I liked Anne Rice's The Vampire Lestat.  I had an obsession with vampires and Gothic horror in general.  And I found out about the novel Interview with the vampire.  So I read that novel in the course of one weekend.  At the back of the book it advertised The Vampire Lestat.  And I was delighted.  I wanted to know his side of things.  I believed he had a story to tell.  It seemed obvious to me from the little hints in Interview with The Vampire.  And I was absolutely delighted with Lestat and his rock persona. At the time I was also just getting in to David Bowie.  And I saw a comparison to Ziggy Stardust and Lestat.   Lestat- a vampire pretending to be a rock star pretending to be a vampire.  And David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust- A rock star pretending to be an alien, pretending to be a rock star pretending to be an alien.  <BR>        I was in love.  And it wasn't the 'charisma of the undead' so get that idea right out of your heads.  I don't usually find vampires very sexy.  To be honest, the brooding, byronic vampires bore me.<BR>         I loved Lestat's rebellion.  I loved his angst.  I loved his passion.  I loved his inability to be discouraged for very long.  I loved his human questioning, which was handled very differently than Louis' brooding.  I loved his need to escape and it's realization when he went to Paris.  I loved his sensuality.  His passion.  I felt a connection to him.  A vampire Glam Rock musician- basis for Goth culture.  Replacing the old cliche of the cape and castle with a leather jacket and motorcycle.  I had wondered where the modern vampire style had come from!<br />          I spent the summer of 1996 reading The Vampire Chronicles.  I felt slightly cheated with Tale of the body Thief.  It was cliche but good for comic relief but it didn't have the same... fire as The Queen of the damned.  It seemed like something had been lost.  <BR>           By the end of the summer I found Memnoch The Devil, which was still a pretty new novel at the time and was only just coming out as a large paper back, after the initial hardcover release.  And I read it.  But it upset me and disappointed me.  <BR>      I had a Catholic upbringing too but Anne seems very obsessed with religion and history lately and I think it hinders on the actual story.  Also, a part of Lestat's charm was that he was searching for answers in the chaos, a reason, and was uncertain of any of the universe's mysteries.  Now it seems a part of that charm is gone.  Anne's trying to correct that now by putting a shadow of doubt on what the things Lestat saw might have been but it's clear she wants us to think he did see God and The Devil and that poor vampire has learned that there is no real reason.  The Universe is governed by powerful lunatics.   No wonder he went mad with grief.  The poor, damned bastard.  I had thought she ruined him, especially after he had laid on the chapel floor for so long.
