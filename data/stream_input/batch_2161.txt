B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book stinker I had no idea they would make a book on a English dictionary I sure would not.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|It has a good storyline and is easy to watch.<br />The characters are very interesting.<br />It is an excellent period piece.
B005T87QCI|5.0|f f f. People who say this game is dumb for kindle fire r lieng but if they say it doesn't work and its a different electronic then I MIGHT agree.
B002UD56I6|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my friend and as far as I know the movie was awesome, the price was definitely affordable for a blu ray and she loved it!

B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|My son has fun playing this game.  It is like guitar hero for the piano. sometimes he says the timing is off and swears he hit the right key on time, but for the price it's a fun little app.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|I liked it but the ending seemed choppy, I thought there would be more detail on the character's readjustment to gravity, and suffering from other hazards of being on Mars for such a long time.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|The digital copy accidentally got put on flixster and I can't put it on UV so now I don't have a digital copy for my ipad.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|At first I wasn't sure what this was but after downloading it I saw I can play more than white noise.  There are all kinds of relaxing ambient sounds like waves, rain, etc.  It is great background sounds that are relaxing.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good graphics and game I just do not really care for the inescapable gem treadmill.  But they have to make money somehow.  Hey, I am still playing it.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Could not get the Alarm Clock App to install on my Samsung Android phone after downloading the software. What a wasting of time
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|not a bad game. great graphics and storyline. i just wish it lasted longer. 2.99 is kinda high for a short game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is an amazing story, I could not put this book down.. Unbelievable story that makes you a believer again
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well thought story, all the details and science gave a good degree of realism to it. I wonder if how I felt reading a sci-fi book was actually close to how people felt during Apollo 13. Definitely worth a high production movie, I want to see the Hab, Rover and Hermes!<br /><br />Although I am more interested in space, Weir's writing style and skills could be applied to another book on a different environment (under water?). Just dont stop writing.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Please read the other Harry Hole mysteries BEFORE you read this to more deeply appreciate the craft of the author. I cried as I finished the book. The next day I reread the last fifty pages and I just finished reading them for a 3rd time. I didn't want it the book to end. I hunger for another Harry Hole adventure and I know it will be a long time before it comes. Nesbo is a master at his craft!
B004I744AS|4.0|Its fast and easy to use.. thank you for this app.. I think everyone should have it... I really like it
B004HD61KE|5.0|I could hardly put this book down & sleep. The story has several fascinating historical yarns that Rollins knits together for an action packed rock star story. The background facts on Mormonism and Native American lore was intriguing enough to prompt more study. If you like historical mysteries, read this book. You won't regret it.
B00B935SUY|5.0|I will purchase this film. I love music, and I am 62 years  young. Analog, Analog, Analog. What an adventure. I rented it and watched it twice. The music and variety of band members and their opinons brought back the memories. I danced around the living room! This is an \\"experience\\".
B008IJT0CE|1.0|didn't like the sounds at all......... disappointed I had to pay for it and will never use..I would like my money back
B00AREIAI8|4.0|if the wemen in your life fonsrantly ask for a pony then t<br />get the fun app it has a rainbow unicorn in it . that should be enough to keep them happy.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I watch movies. I read and listen to at least 5 books a week. I thought I knew every plot you could ever use in any of these entertainments. This film has a unique subject, with intelligent and incisive writing. A must see.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|this is alot of fun.... I play it all the time. I was telling my friends about it and they like it too
B003U0AHBO|5.0|let me say this is a great movie if you like gladiator and king arthur. i love this movie and it is really good to see how the legend of robin hood got started and really deviates from what we have seen before it is a good movie for action buff and people who love, films like this and king arthur. all the actors are great in this movie but russel crowe shines in this it is great and the battle scenes are great
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|i loved it. it was everything i thought it would be and more. i really loved it .really really really
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Lauren Oliver has quickly won me over with Delirium and Pandemonium! I am waiting on pins and needles for Requiem.  Lena, the main character, takes us on an empowering, passionate and heart wrenching forbidden love story. Pandemonium dives further into this loveless world and the dangers of being part of the resistance that is building to take back the right to LOVE.  Very well written and the concept will blow your mind.
B00AZ3KPZC|4.0|We (family with young children) started watching the 2006 live action version of The Peter Pan story.  My 3 yr girl loved it so much she wanted to watch 2x a day if I'd let her and walking around with her index finger in a hook!  After a month or so of this I opted to buy this old Disney version.  The kids really like this one at least as much, I think because of the animation and music.  As a mom, I prefer the live action where the idea of adolescent affection is charming unlike the vengeful jealousies of all the female characters (mermaids, Wendy, tink).  And also some insensitive racial depictions from a movie made in 1949. Of course being a cartoon the characters are more caricature ( which may be again why the kids enjoy this one as well). I will say they probably wouldn't have loved this version as much had they not already fallen in love with the story from the live action version
B009GEFXLC|5.0|just catching up love this series. Cant wait to get the time to see them all.  Love these guys. Fun to watch
B00511QI4A|5.0|One of those books that you cannot put down once you've started reading it with superb characters . Good read.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Had to get it when it came out of DVD. Family loves this movie. The dealer shipped it quickly and it arrived fast.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Love this series am so happy I can go back and see all. Did not know this show was on until a few months ago.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This I really appreciate.  I need the know the time I have available before charging.  The display page is excellent.
0765325950|3.0|Have read and loved every book in the series. Had to get the last one and it was offered at a reasonable price.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Good to find this all on one disc, not having to buy a number of discs to get all the Bond music!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Kind of depressing and uplifting in many ways. Charlie had a strange view of life, but relatable too.<br />I loved it!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is just like everyone has said, big and brutish. While I would not want to fillet a trout with this, it serves its purpose. My only gripe is the sheath. Not because it isn't functional, I just prefer leather or nylon.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game is a fun (and relatively quick) game for the whole family.  There is definitely some strategy involved and it is quite challenging to try and play all your pieces.  We've only played a few games, but no one has been able to play all their pieces yet!  Definitely recommend this for game night!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I want to meet Cheryl strayed....she just gets me laughing and crying....I love hiking so it was a huge undertaking to go that alone...
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is an excellent series.  Very interesting and full of suspense.  Once you start this series you can;t stop watching!
B00ABXA1HI|3.0|I purchased this app to be able to work on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. I thought it would work okay but the screen on my Kindle is way too small to really take advantage of the app. You can increase the page and wonder over the screen but it is just too small to work on my Kindle....great for the 8.9 Kindle.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|This album was the first time I've downloaded one through the internet! I've got to say, this the best Foo Fighters album I have ever heard! In my opinion again, Wasting Light is even better than The Color And The Shape!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love It. Very entertaining. I always am looking forward to the next episode. A great series to get series to follow.  I hope there will be a season 3.
B004I744AS|2.0|I purchased this dictionary for various reasons. I play Scrabble for Friends and other word games....I thought that this dictionary would assist me with various words and definitions of those words. But I can't figure out how to use the dog gone thing! It's a little frustrating to not be able to use it. I am considering deleting it from my Kindle. FYI...I just went on my Kindle and played with the Dictionary and finaly saw how to get the information you would need to make the thing work! It looks like you will need to play with the app to figure how to input your word or how you think the word is spelled and on from there. Looks pretty simple to figure out...I may edit my review of this app at a later date.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This book gave a good intro into beginning years of Drizzt and of the drow culture. I had always wondered why drizzt was different from his other kin. I can not wait to continue the series.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I was shocked. I really didn't think an app could be this fun if it was free, but it is really good. And the ads don't show up until the end, so they don't interfere with play.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is sooo relaxing !! I use it when I am playing games, writing on My Notes on Life app, on my computer or when I just want to relax. You are able to create your own favorite music or use the music that is created already for you. The ones that are created for you....you will need earplugs to hear the pre-recorded music. Its a great app and I suggest that you try it yourself!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved this book. For a few months I hesitated to read it because I heard such mixed reviews, but I finally decided my curiosity was greater than my fear that I wouldn't like it. It was worth it.<br /><br />I haven't desired to read a book this fast for a long time, so even though the content could be depressing, it still pushed me to devour its words. What I realized as I read this was that if you read this book wanting the hope and likeable characters of Harry Potter's world, you would likely wind up disappointed. The characters of The Casual Vacancy are adults with all the scars, fears, narrow mindedness, prejudices, and appearances to be kept that we all have. The teenagers described are the same. But I only absolutely hate one character, and that is due to her selfish, smug personality. The desire to smack her occurred on several occasions, but to some extent, I could relate to something about each of the rest of them. And despite the tremendously sorrowful moments that occurred, all I could think was, \\"This story feel very real to me.\\" At times it is ugly, but in the end, some people improve through experience.<br /><br />I'd read it again.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Everyone loves this show. We can watch the same episode over again and again and laugh every time. Our friends want to borrow it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A bittersweet story. One of sadness, heartache, joy and triumph. It's a quick read and the desperately sad chapters are quickly followed by chapters of hope and possibility. I will never see the number 86 as just a number again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful depiction of life in the early 20th century. Realistically demonstrates the relationship between the homeowner and their servants during the 20th century.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I don't need to go on & on, there are alot of well written reviews of this knife & some great videos by E2E on YouTube with Ethan Becker himself. But if you love your BK2 like I love mine check out Hedgehog Leatherworks sheaths they are the best hand made, made to order leather sheaths there are.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Seven Wonders is noticeably absent on the US version. The European version contains it. Great Mac song from the late 80s. What an amazing band. So excited to see them live in the next few months!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a very good serie, I never watch a lot of movies but tis one I couldn't turn off the tv.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I found it funny and romantic at the same time. The acting was great. I read the book first then watched the movie. Of all the Emma's filmed this by far is the best version.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I pre-ordered this and thankfully got it downloaded before my flight to LA...so I was so excited to have a new Stevie album to digest during my long flight. I just can't stop listening to this...so powerful. I love almost every song. For What Its Worth, Moonlight, Annabel Lee and New Orleans are just masterpieces. The artwork is also very enjoyable. Much better effort than Trouble in Shangri-La. Love Miss Nicks!
B000FBJFSC|4.0|This is an old book that I finally read...it was hard to get through, there was so much hardship.  It was a sad/funny tome on poverty and politics in Ireland.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Heart wrenching, tragically spellbinding.  Well done.  Narrator voice is morbidly compelling.  Shining moments bring levity to an otherwise desperate plot during Hitler's reign.
B00AGKH45I|4.0|Really nice set. The Rosebud doc is shorter than I thought and some of the &#34;extras&#34; have been released before. But overall this is a great treatment of one of the most iconic albums of all time. Love Fleetwood Mac forever and love having this collection!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Slow to start, repetitive, but made the point...very thought provoking. The ending was unexpected, and almost anyone in the retired age group could identify with \\"some\\" part of the story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I sell Avon, this app makes it super easy to figure up my orders! I highly recommend it for anyone that owns their own business like Avon.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. large print. good app, plus its free. you will enjoy it. download it to your kindle or tsb
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I wish I knew all the meanings by heart.  I could buy flowers for my family and friends to tell them how I feel.  Delightful story with a happy ending.
B003U9W3GM|5.0|After watching the mini series &reading the book i would suggest other readers to watch the series so as to assimilate the caracter from the series to the book. a brilliant read.
B0018Q4BTQ|5.0|If he keeps recording I will keeping buying! Love his music & videos! I love the song Waitin' on a woman!
B003MC5N28|3.0|The book was okay; not great, not awful.  It's a decent &#34;food for thought&#34; read, but I tend to like a little... MORE from my reads.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is amazing now there is armor and alot of better stuff there could be super flat land but that might be in the next updates.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a spectacular British Soap Opera. It takes place in early 1900's and is a superbly detailed period piece with well developed characters and interesting plotlines. Twists and turns keep your interest.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|while searching apps for the kindle I saw this game at the top of the free section.  amazing little game to pass some time.  you can spend 5 minutes or an hour playing it.  highly recommended.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|totally awsome but sometimes spidey doesn't do what you want him to.  The graphics are good i just don't like that you can't go to Brooklyn
B00AJLHUA8|2.0|I am a fan of movies especially  horror movies, suspense , and thriller . This SUCKED! they couldnt have made it more interesting. Like others have said there were so many plot turns that this could have taken. ugh at least i just spent 3 dollars on it .
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great app for weather.  I would reccommend to anyone to keep up with weather.  Easy to use and has great parts.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was slightly disappointed in the ending. The end of the book was very fast-paced and makes you feel like you missed a lot. I found it to be predictable, yet readable. I loved the series.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is the basic set of episodes.  There is another edition that has extras but I happen to come across this edition on Amazon when it was $15-$20 and I just jumped on it.<br /><br />I highly recommend sticking with the BBC original with David Attenborough.  I never thought narration could really make or break something as dramatically as I now feel it can.  I can't say I didn't like the US version but there is just a quality his Mr Attenborough's narration that makes the most mundane nature shots interesting.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Very informative but it needs a search bar, pictures and ways to send words from the text to friends. Good book.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Understanding that this movie was not mainly about flying, but addiction, it really overreached on the drinking & drug issue for the captain. Not just smoking and drinking, but cocaine and speed as well? This is beyond any stretch of the imagination. As for the flying, that was absolutely unrealistic as well. I did not expect the movie to be like a documentary, but I did expect at least a semblance of realism. As for Denzel Washington, I thought he did a very good job within the script he had to work with.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This is the coolest game ever since I have played need for speed most wanted 2 &amp;the wheres my water upgrade<br /><br />Aronlhopkins
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book like no other, I could not put it down. It was a great story.  I look forward to the next book from this author .
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this little game! if you like games like super mario brothers you'll like this one! i wish there were more games like this for my kindle fire.
B0093WVND4|5.0|The book reads like the movie, which I love.  I recommend this book to everyone !  I will read this book again because, I can.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Americans need to wake up and take Paul seriously. He can see the writing on the wall, why can't you?
B0063IH60K|5.0|an easy game to just relax with when you're tired of games that require thinking and/or strategy. a simple card game that's a classic
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I didnt like it at all.....its nothing like my pc layout.....I am just happy I did not have to pay for it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Seriously, make it stop. Can't.....put...stupid....game....down. my five year old and I are cracking out on it as I type, in fact I am typing meaning not playing.....
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|i love the cd and i am glad that i got it. It's so good that I listen to it over and over again I can not put it down and I never will love the music he makes and can not wait for more to come. love the way he sing too.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's okay<br />,,,,,,,,,,,Graphics are good<br /> Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok Rate and get gems still not enough words
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|The sense of freedom this movie inspires is just as powerful as the cautionary tale it tells. Watching this movie makes me want to run away from all my worldly troubles but reminds me how much damage the abandonment of loved ones can cause.
B0095XPZBC|2.0|Sucks when you rush production and pass it onto an crappy company that can't render anything. Not worth paying for.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I did not dislike anything about the Fringe Series, The character Walter was funny almost all the time.  The love story<br />between Peter and Olivia was great.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I really enjoy all Nicholas Sparks books.  This one is a great mix of romance healing and drama.  I have just been to the movie and it is also excellent (my husband even liked it).
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Great TV show, watched the show on fox tv before it went off the air. Can't wait for season 5 to come out.
B008BM9L72|5.0|When I first started this trilogy I was not sure it was going to be something for me.  But especially the 2nd and 3rd books you really come to care about both main characters journeys.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I loved the idea of time travelling, even more coming from Stephen King.<br />But this book sometimes gets a little slow.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I actually haven't seen this movie yet. I was going to stream it, but I noticed that Amazon has been raising their price to $4.98 on some titles.  I can wait for it to get to Redbox for a buck-twenty/buck-sixty for Bluray. I'm sure the movie is fine.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I never couold get into this book so I never finished it. It was<br />very philosophical, so someone who likes that kind of read would<br />probably enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is easy to learn, but challenging and fast paced. The music is great...I start playing any time flies by. I really like Subway Suffers!!!!
B001AUEMFS|4.0|You can't go wrong with a cold play song. They have music that is un-comparable to other groups. Good song
B00B6DTWM2|4.0|Although I do enjoy a good thriller/horror movie, what got me with Sinister is... Ethan Hawke's character wandered through the house at night to investigate all the bumps and sounds, and DOESN'T EVEN TURN ON A SINGLE LIGHT!  LOL  I guess that's what gives this movie it's edge.  Totally recommend it!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I just love all the songs. The lead singer's voice is beautiful. I recommend it to everyone. You will love it too.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Nobody told me that this take was only a sample. The graphics and quality is amazing, but $5;) to buy the full!?!?! REALLY!!! Not cool. Beside that, I absolutely loved the game.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great story, I loved the exciting life of Travis and Abby, although I will admit Abby was frustrating me for most of the book. Which only made me keep reading, lost sleep and late for work just so I could keep reading. Loved it!!
B002361MLA|3.0|Much too repetitive. Half of the book would have sufficed to pass on the message. I do not recommend it.
B000FC0SIM|3.0|It is an interesting autobiography of Stephen King. However, the title suggests that it is something else. I think this title was chosen on purpose to attract wannabe writers. A title should not be a hook to catch readers who might not be interested in reading the story of King's life.<br /><br />Although I found the book well written and amusing. I feel I have been taken for a ride, my fault perhaps, I should have read a few reviews.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book should be a requirement for everyone from the age of 12 and it should keep it handy for a regular review/consultation.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This product helped bridge the gap from FireWire to Thunderbolt.  It is very useful and allows us to continue to use older external devices.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this was a great sharpener for the price and all my knifes are nice and sharp now! ready for some camping this spring.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Needed an option for Internet access without using wifi. This made it easy to connect at a client location that does not allow wifi.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Enjoyed the book and the twist at the end. Very entertaining and can't put down read. The movie should be good too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am presently reading Mockingjay.  I enjoy all of the characters. I just love the Hunger Games series!<br />I am anxious to finish the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this SO much you should get it I live it and play it all the time and. its NOT stuppid
B0066W1AZK|3.0|the computer does a move called castling and you cannot do it yourself. why? i dont know, it is very unfair
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game that can really get you motivated an teach kids responsibility the horse are very realistic
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The second season was a disappointment. The third season renewed my interest. It was difficult not talking with friends who enjoy the show until they saw the last episode on the regular TV schedule. Now we're talking and can't wait until the next season begins.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Does what it is supposed to do when it is supposed to do it.  All programs should be this easy to use.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|You read the book and they constantly are talking about marathons like they're evening strolls.  The book follows multiple stories that all combine into one spectacular finish that makes you want to continue reading even though you've run out of pages.
B007SGM084|5.0|It's impossible to turn off the light and stop reading!!<br />Every woman should find a Christian Gray in her life!
B005P1YCNK|4.0|\\"The Compound Effect\\" provides the reader with a variety of new attitudes to develop in order to improve overall success and lifestyle. The one thing I do not agree on is having to remove every bad habit from your life, even the ones which a person usually does for fun or a hobby.<br /><br />I don't believe watching a movie at night or your favorite sitcom is a crime since its not educational or inspirational. Neither is listening to your favorite band over an audio clip of somebody talking about how to achieve success.<br /><br />I will take the ideas in this book and implement them into my lifestyle because I want to be as successful as I can be and reach my full potential and beyond. But I believe anyone can do this without having to eliminate every single bad habit. No one is perfect, this is what makes us unique.<br /><br />If all anyone did was listen to success tapes and read about inspirational stories, we'd all be a bunch of competitive monotonous zombies.<br /><br />Honestly though, highly recommend this book! Worksheets at the end of the book are extremely helpful and I love the idea of having a peak-performance partner.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Let me start by saying that usually K.Knightly makes me turn the tv off... however I absolutely loved this movie. The fact that Jane Austen practically invented romance is the largest part.<br />The sets are all amazing and what one would expect for a period film that deals with differences in station.<br />The actor playing Mr. Darcy is sharp and rough but not so much that you can't understand how a smolder turns into an outright fire with him.<br />Scenes in the rain on fields.... *sigh* every woman should see this if nothing else just to have the moment where Darcy says \\"You have bewitched me.....\\"<br /><br />Ok I'm going to be daydreaming for the remainder of the day
B00138J234|5.0|I just played this album twice today. Every single song holds up great after all these years- at least for me. I can't believe it's available for $2.99.That's the best music bargain I've ever seen. I like the Black Keys, Broken Bells, Arcade Fire, Jack White and some of the modern music. I'm also a big classics fan (Springsteen, The Stones, The Beatles, The Who, Led Zep, Van Morrison, Dylan, Clapton, Marley etc.). This album is easily one of the best of all time. As for the 9 people who gave this one star, I would love to know what they listen to. Actually, if the don't like this classic, who cares?
1616550414|5.0|When the package arrived, I never thought it was the book.  This book is pretty dense and heavy.  When I unwrapped and opened the book, I can see why.  The artistry and story behind what and why things were done when designing each character, environment, and story is worth the buy for anyone who's played the game.  I'm happy with this buy.
B000OPPSXK|4.0|Many an accolade has been heaped upon Dudamel's new Mahler 9. The Pantheon beckons - not that I am in any hurry to acquire it . . . . . . hey, remind me to buy maple-syrup when I am next at the supermarket. Anyway, the aforementioned edifice is replete with great performances of that symphony. An anecdote comes to mind. Klemperer attended one of Kertesz's rehearsals. A concert was nigh. Kertesz was spending far more time on Mahler than on the Mozart symphony which was to feature in the first half of the program. He was accordingly upbraided by Uncle Otto. Anyone can conduct Mahler well enough, the invalid croaked: Mozart is infinitely harder. Invest your energies there!<br /><br />Thus speaks Wisdom. Who can hear Her?<br /><br />Discography bears this out. How many performances of Mozart's symphonies are in a Pantheon of their own? Not very good or excellent - I mean great. This is how I see the order of things (and feel free to dissent): Kna in the Jupiter; Furtwangler and the Berlin Philharmonic (not the VP!!!) in K 550; Herbie / BP 1976 (DG) in K 543; Uncle Karl / BP in K 338 & Uncle Otto / New Philharmonia in K 319. That's it. Oh, one aspirant warrants a special mention: Rene Jacobs. He's not fit to clean the latrines of the aforementioned edifice. Avoid his Telemann . . . . . sorry, Mozart Symphonies like the pox!<br /><br />What of this Krips cycle? Where does it sit in the scheme of things?<br /><br />Firstly, the entire cycle is musical to its marrow. What a marvelous orchestra the RCO was in the early Seventies. When uxorious with Philips engineering at its best, this survey is clearly a contender even if reservations arise.<br /><br />Here are some vignettes:<br /><br />K 134 - excellent. As good as the Bohm / BP and better recorded.<br /><br />K 162 - excellent. That being said, one so misses the timpani that Koopman throws into the mix.<br /><br />K 181 - excellent. As good as the Bohm / BP and better recorded by a mile. What violas!<br /><br />K 182 - excellent. So much warmer and deeper than Levine & the Vienna Philharmonic.<br /><br />K 183 - arguably the highlight of the set. It has as much drive as the old Bruno Walter. What an oboist in the first movement! The slow movement is a passport to Elysium. The finale is played opulently.<br /><br />K 184 - very good. I prefer Harnoncourt here who brings more weight to bear.<br /><br />K 199 - an unloved work. This is almost the best performance known to me. It has the edge on the Bohm / BP and is better recorded. What violas (just listen to 49'ff in the first movement)!<br /><br />K 200 - there is a touch of (additional) resonance to the recording. This is a first-class account and so much more vibrant than the treacle dished out by Uncle Karl. What a horn-signal in the Minuet, only to be answered by cellos and double-basses at their most resplendent. Indeed, I was thinking that Harnoncourt with the same orchestra was holding his own in the first two movement but in the Minuet Krips pulls away by a fair margin. The immortal melody in the finale is rapturously played. All in all, this K 200 can hold its own against any contender.<br /><br />K 201. There are many excellent performances of the A Major on the market. This is one of them and stands near the front of the ranks. The Minuet - a notorious swamp for the older generation of conductors - is thankfully quick on its heels. How the orchestra listens to one another in the finale.<br /><br />K 202 - like K 199, this is an unloved work. After a rough start, the RCO tears into the music like it is a masterpiece. Krips is a more persuasive advocate than Uncle Karl and Big Jim Levine and the recording is immeasurably better too.<br /><br />K 297 Paris - like the C Major, there is a touch more resonance to the recording though not enough to impair one's enjoyment. This is a thoroughly musical traversal of this work, even if Krips and the Dutchies do not match Uncle Karl and the Berliners for sheer panache in the first movement (mind you, the placements are reversed in the finale where Uncle Karl is testudinal).<br /><br />K 318. What a gun performance. It is almost the best known to me.<br /><br />K 319 - lacking timpani as it does, the B Flat is an exquisite example of a `chamber symphony'. This is a lovely performance of a lovely work which does not displace Uncle Otto in my estimations. Yet again, the RCO plays like an army of generals.<br /><br />K 338 - the first movement is right on the money - wow. The finale, however, falls short of Uncle Karl & the Berlin Philharmonic in exuberance. Unlike his competitors, Krips does not include K 409 as the minuet.<br /><br />K 385. This symphony is a Herbie warhorse. Be it the live performance from the 1957 Salzburg Festival or the cracker (DG) from the mid-Seventies, he is a force to be reckoned with. Superlative though they be, the Dutchies cannot quite match the Berliners in sheer torque in the first movement. How the trumpets cut across proceedings in the finale and memorably so! All in all, this is a first class account but not the front-runner.<br /><br />K 425 Linz. The opening Adagio is far too fast for my liking. It runs seamlessly into the Allegro. The outburst at 38'ff in the finale is vin ordinaire. Well played as it is, this account lacks the sizzle of both the Herbie (DG, not EMI) and Uncle Karl. I can't see myself returning to this performance any time soon<br /><br />K 504 Prague - the slow introduction is too fast for my liking; other than that, this is a first account rendition. The counterpoint in the development of the first movement - where Mozart harries God - is magisterially rendered.<br /><br />K 543 - a first-class account of the great E Flat as one would expect of the array of forces. Krips does not hurry the Adagio opening. This is highly listenable from the first note to the last, assisted no end by a vintage Philips recording. Krips does not observe the repeat in the first movement which is fine by me. The RCO showcases its burnished tone in the Andante con moto (just listen to its opening bars). Its excellence notwithstanding, it falls short of the Herbie K 543 from 1976 which is sui generis in its visceral excitement.<br /><br />K 550.  Oophs. Krips and Uncle Karl must have patronised the same optometrist. The outer movements are slow, prosaic and lacking in tension. Come the great development section of the finale, Krips fails to unveil the head of the Medusa. No complaint re the inner movements. The Dutchies give their utmost but there is no circumventing the lethargy from the podium.<br /><br />K 551 Jupiter. Well played as it is, the outer movements are bereft of tension and lack a sense of occasion. The Minuet is sveltely played. While Kna's performance with the Vienna Philharmonic sounds as if it was recorded in a snowstorm from the contemporaneous Operation Typhoon, it comprehensively stomps on this pedestrian account to the point of dismemberment.<br /><br />All in all, provided one takes the Linz, K 550 and Jupiter out of the equation - and insofar as this is possible per se - this is a first class traversal of Mozart symphonies.<br /><br />I have yet to hear Dudamel. A priori, I am suspicious of his Bruckner Ninth. From what I gather, the Salzburg Kid has yet to appear in his discography: perhaps this is wisdom on his part.

B0097JYVAU|4.0|Nate Silver does a great job explaining why the future is so difficult to predict and makes the case for a more nuanced view of the so called experts that appear everywhere in the media.<br /><br />For those who have no knowledge of the subtleties of baseball, basketball, NFL football then large parts of the book need to be skipped.<br /><br />His explanation of Bayesian statistics is the best I have seen and his opening example is very amusing.<br /><br />Well worth a read.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Not his best but very up to date in world politics. He opened the door to reality which is one of his great talents.

I saw the preview for this movie and thought it would be crap and now, I've seen it TWICE and loved it both times!! PLEASE DISNEY, PLEASE make the sequels!!
B000M53GM2|5.0|GoldenEye is a fantastic movie and having this DVD proves that it is still a great movie.  My husband and I are both fans of Bond.  The DVD came very quickly and is in good working order.  What else can you ask for?
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I love the snark buster games but am really frustrated. In the third chapter where you are gathering the pieces of the phonograph record the final piece is under the menu tab for my kindle fire hd. It's so close that I can't touch the piece, only the menu tab, any suggestions?
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am a huge fan of the books and I love the movies.  This is a great set.  The case is very sturdy and all my DVDs are stored safe and sound.  It came in three days, which was two days early.  A perfect gift for anyone that loves the movies.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Now this is the type of kindle book we all hope for. You trawl through all the cheap garbage hoping to find a diamond in the rough. And this is definitely a diamond.<br /><br />The strength of this novel is all the hard science. That could also have been its downfall. The science is fascinating but a book with that and nothing else would had been very, very dry. Luckily the author must have recognised this and so created a very witty and entertaining protagonist. This is a wonderfully enjoyable novel at an incredible price. Probably the best value kindle book I have bought so far.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Babel is one great song after another.  I usually don't buy CDs because only 4 or so of the songs are worth listening to but this is not the case for Babel.  The Mumford and Sons have hit another home run in my book.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy is by far one of my favorites, and holds truths about our future that we ignore at our own peril. My fervent wish is that everyone reads, and understands the danger of something like this actually taking place if we continue along our current path of self-destruction. Written with such detail, and vivid foresight, I can only feel empathy for the author, as we both have lived vicariously through the tale. Though I seriously doubt that my travails were nearly as torturous as her's, as she lived the story for month, if not years. I read the fruits of her labor in three days, both times. Truly, those who don't learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it. May God have mercy on us all.

B009XTF8JM|3.0|This movie has some entertainment value for horror fans, but ultimately isn't as good as it could have been. I thought the special effects and music were pretty solid, but the payoff at the end of the movie was thin. I would have liked a more intense exorcism scene without a \\"happy\\" ending. Worth a rental - not worth buying.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book was just a chance author I thought I would try and I found it not to my liking. It was boring. SORRY
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was interesting to read the &#34;thoughts behind the actions&#34; that we had all heard reported.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Saw the movie with my daughter. The story was engaging.. loved the characters...<br /> Hated twilight.. but this has a plot and strong female characters. Nice brain candy!
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|I'll be referring back to this book time and time again as I prepare new presentations.  The insights into how to make my own presentations smoother, with greater impact, were fantastic.  More work, but now I've got a great framework to work from.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|The story is great as it is developing the characters and it is a nice twist on the arthur legends.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I did not know what to expect from this book, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Great characters and there was even a twist.  Very enjoyable read.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I this book a lot it's totally worth the money you pay because every page unfolds in to a problem building to the conculsion
B00BESNKB8|3.0|This movie was loaded with plenty of action and gore, awesome fight scenes, but the main premise of the film, &#34;The Man with the Iron Fists&#34; didn't even appear until well after the halfway point of the film.  The acting is expected from those involved at the level you would expect from each.  RZA's direction was better than his acting.  Overall, I enjoyed it for what it was, an action movie, but the plot was about as flaky as most old 1970's kung fu movies... The only thing missing to make this like one of those old school kung fu movies was a fight scene with people who weren't in the rest of the movie and didn't tie into the plot in anyway and an abrupt ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome but I wish you could play with other people that are far away like on the cumputer and xbox. other wise this ti's the best came ever!!!!
B005HEDUNS|2.0|Though my family and I love watching the Original Series episodes, this one's story was pretty lame.  I kinda thought the same about Trouble with Tribbles, but my kids laughed hysterically at that one.  My 18 year old daughter thinks Kirk rules.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Yes it was a really quick read and i could have used a little bit more depth but its catered for teens so I guess I have to expect that. Otherwise it has a good plot with good characters.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Each character is developed so thoroughly that your emotions are constantly bei g tugged at. Beautiful story and well told
B006DJ2JSI|2.0|i would rather use a book .  takes too long to look up a word unless you know how to spell it perfectly<br /><br />rather use a book! hard to just jump to what I am searching for unless i know exact spelling
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I played this game on my first generation Kindle Fire and had no problems with the download or the operation of the game. This game is not a typical hidden object game that requires you to find hundreds of obscured objects in each scene. Your task is to search the scenes for objects that will be used to complete tasks in other parts of the game. Some of these objects are \\"hidden\\" in a drawer, for instance - others are in plain sight. You must investigate each scene and its contents and collect these items.  Along the way you will have to figure out how these items are to be used to solve the game. Mini puzzles are also part of this game and are integrated  into the story. I loved this game and the challenge it presented. I would recommend this game to others and  I hope to see many more games like this from its creators.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Thought provoking and interestingly written but way too long.  Could be condensed into a 1 hour Law and Order or maybe 2 hour Lifetime movie.  Actually wouldn't be surprised if that was where it came from.
B004HW7JH4|2.0|The show is great, but it was VERY frustrating not to be able to watch one of the discs because it was scratched.
1857885082|5.0|This book was great! I kept having to go into the other room and interrupt my husband's music to read passages to him. I got great laughs throughout. I read a lot of English fiction and enjoy English television. This opened up these worlds and gives new depth to what I'm reading and watching. I highly recommend it!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I think this is a great app to have on the road with you when you travel. It blocks out the outside world and allows you to relax. great
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It is helpful to you because if you don`t know a  word you can  look it up.<br />I like it  because you can look up.  5 stars
B00001PE4D|4.0|This DVD adds much flavor to the movie I saw in theatres in 1999. I won't go into much detail on the plot, suffice it to say that this take on the script was an original one.<br /><br />I'll list what I loved about this movie. First of all I'm glad it was made. It has the kind of subject matter--manipulative ppeople, cruel kids, interracial relationships and other immoralities that might turn a studio off. Kudos to Columbia pictures for making it. The performances from top to bottom were first rate. Ryan Phillipe, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Sean Patrick Thomas and the great Swoosie Kurtz were incredible!<br /><br />The beginning sets this movie off right. There we see a bored Sebastian discussing his problems with a clearly disinterested pshchiatrist (Another Reason For One To Refuse Therapists). Not only does Dr. Greenbaum (Played By Swoosie Kurtz) seem disinterested in her session with Sebastian, she is overcharging him. However, Sebastian knows this and has already hatched his revenge. Knowing that day will be his last time seeing Dr. Greenbaum, he departs, knowing he had seduced, sexed and humiliated her darling daughter Marci (Played Wonderfully In Cameo By Tara Reid) even posting naked pictures of her on the internet! Damn, what a bombshell to start the movie off on! Then to add success to his triumph he picks up another beautiful girl that same afternoon! The girl, a complete stranger, seemed drawn to Sebastian as he looked up and gloated at his former psychiatrist on the upper level of the building. The scene ends with him walking off with her hand in hand.<br /><br />Now for what I did not like about the movie. On the DVD there were scenes that were cut out from the movie. Of the six scenes that were removed, I feel three should have remained. One dealt with the humiliation of the gay football player. I felt they were a bit to PC when they took out part of that scene. It would not have made Sebastian any more mean to the audience. Another scene that was not realistic was where Ronald Clifford is discovered in the drawer under Kathryn's bed hiding from Sebastian. Why not go all the way in and have the two of them discovered in the middle of coitus on her bed? I feel they held back so as not to offend the sensibilities of those who were prudish and/or racist concerning interracial sex (Particularly In The American South). In the third cut scene, Sebastian realizes he's been duped and then hits his stepsister and demands sex from her. She refuses, and he leaves the room; removing that form the movie was a mistake, as it made her subsequent call to Clifford asking him to \\"fight for her honor\\" hollow. Why would she do this if she had not been actually hit? Since the striking scene and attempted rape scene were removed from the movie, there was no reason for her to go so far as to solicit Ronald Clifford into beating her brother up. Why? Because she had already won. Her duping Sebastian into dumping the love of his life and then rejecting his sexual advances outright was victory enough. Anything more would have been overkill. Why would she take it that far? Thus there was no need for her to get Ronald Clifford to attack her stepbrother. This plot inconsistency subtracts a full Star from my review. Had she actually been struck and thrown to the floor (Like The Edited Scene Shows), then her call to Clifford would have made sense. Kathryn was smart enough to realize she had to live with her brother. Why would she take things that far? If she overplayed her hand, she'd only succede in alienating her brother to the point of making an enemy within her home (Had He Lived). In the end it is Annette who destroys her.<br /><br />I still recommend this movie to viewers. The deleted scenes and the making of features more than make this DVD worthwhile. You may or may not like the CD soundtrack as well. The money and wealth of the people discussed in this film is incredible. It is what we all aspire to have and be. I'm the 106th Four Star review and the 508th overall person to review this great movie and DVD.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
0345357116|5.0|It was very good service. It has taken less then the maximum number of days to get to my residence. It have REALLY enjoyed the book.
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|I could not put this book down!!  It has given me some important insights into myself and others around me!
B000SZNET6|1.0|I purchased this on a whim, and was absolutely thrilled I was able to find the title at all. That being said, after having paid $12.99 for a film, I expected to watch it. My internet connection is 12 down, 2 up, and should be more than capable of running this streaming product. I rebooted my computer, rebooted my router, reset my connection, you name it, I tried it. The film continuously stopped at the 0:25 mark.<br /><br />Save yourself the aggravation and go through the Itunes store...that version played perfectly!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book has it all sex, love, and rock and roll. Can't wait for the final book in June!  Don't sleep on this book.
B0064MT1YO|3.0|This season was a lot less exciting than the first season in part because there iSight less sex and violence. It focuses more on the characters personal lives with school and inner demons.
B00BESIKWM|5.0|Anyone who has played a Silent hill game can appreciate the beauty that the movies pick up and the topsy turvy almost storyline that still doesn't make perfect sense at the end of the movie!!! This one does an exceptional job of continuing the tense exploration of dimensional shifting darkness. I suggest watching at night with all the lights and cell phones off and just let your mind roll with the tension and enjoy the descent into what Silent Hill is!!! :-)
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This just gets better and better! Just sad that it was it was a bit hard to follow with all of the new characters. Also, missed knowing what was happening with the other characters of the book... On to the next book!!
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I must say I love the opening to this movie and the reusing of the soundtrack but morphing it into something new and appreciative! It was great to finally have an real life Leon to see cast. He did a good job, it would have been nice to have a few more classic Leon lines for the gamers to enjoy. The plot concept was pretty good, but the action scenes are not always enough to carry through the somewhat awkward quiet moments. My personal favorite is Apocalypse, and I would probably put this around Extinction's type of film as far as layout and movement of story materials. Overall not a bad option to the film series but a little lacking in some respects.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I am really enjoying the American Horror Story franchise.  The way they cover multiple genres of horror is quite novel.  I tuned into season 2 and exected to see a continuance of season 1 and was treated to an entirely new adventure.  Bravo!  Can't wait to see if they can do it again.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I love Tom Hardy and he is hands down incredible with the silently tortured character!!. I was expecting a bunch of UFC clip fighting and instead got a real storyline that makes you feel for the characters and builds that integrity in a real life messed up relationships kind of way. A big fist pump for Warrior!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I do not read much but I have this app so I can rent my textbooks. Great way to save money.
B009GENZKS|4.0|Yet again another wonderful CGI anime to continue the Resident Evil storyline!! Clean animation and good English dubbing. I would suggest watching this movie between Resident Evil Extinction and Resident Evil Retribution, ESPECIALLY if you haven't stayed up to date on your gaming. It nicely fills  in a few creature gaps and plot points. But other than that it's a well done movie to watch regardless!!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Don't watch this if you got in a big fight with your mom and then your mom died. It will make you cry.

B004VYYA2K|5.0|Very clever toy i wish i had growing up.  sturdy, colorfull, and invites play and creativity. holds LOTS of Barbies and accessories.  sides zip up and down for box or layout.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Miserables has always been my favorite musical. When I saw the opening credits, I was drawn into post- revolution France. The singing was flawless and my heart broke for Anne Hathaway. Her voice made me tear up, never before done in a Les Mis adaption before. I was extremely impressed with the film (get goosebumps just thinking about seeing it Christmas Day and how amazing it was). At the end, I was on my feet clapping, something else I have never done. I cannot wait to get the DVD and I am going to have to buy 2: One for the home and one as my own personal copy.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|slow and nothing new so i deleated it after 1 day.  the character movement on screen was confusing also and i couldn't add onto my house

B00991TCOG|5.0|I was unfamiliar with Lindsey's music until I stumbled upon it while watching videos on youtube.  The few songs I heard made me very interested in purchasing the CD, and I wasn't disappointed  She is a vary talented violinist and composer.  All of the song on the CD were great. I hope she puts out more of them in the future.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|What an interesting story, a story I would have never read if my sister hadn't recommended this book to me. I very much enjoyed it, a story of the true meaning of a person's time on earth. I do recommended this book, it is not very long but hard to put down.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I enjoyed this book despite all of the references to Swedish names and locations that I am not familiar with.
1579129129|1.0|I wish I could recommend this book; in fact the content is excellent.  The problem is that it has, like so many other pictorial publications these days, been produced in China.  In this case that means that the pages literally stink of some sort of chemical--so much so that it is impossible to read without being overpowered.  I have found many Chinese-printed books to reek of chemicals, and I don't mean a mild smell but an odor that can hardly be endured.  Whatever they are doing there (likely a process forbidden in western nations) ought to be taken into consideration by publishers.  In addition the actual picture content is not as well done as could be.  This likely also results from cheap production methods.  If you have allergies or if you intend to read this book indoors, be prepared for the smell, which approximates formaldehyde.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This was a gift for my grandson.<br />If you want a movie the whole family can watch I would recommend this one.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I wish I had read this book 3 years ago. It's got some great ideas, lessons, and pearls of wisdom. The book is well-written and the chapters are &#34;snack&#34; sized for easy consumption.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This movie purchase was for my husband.<br />Great movie at a good price.<br />He was very happy and has viewed it several times.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is so much fun and very entertaining!  The harmony, dancing, and characters make this movie enjoyable for everyone. Acting is quite good also.
B0001GNJQ0|1.0|This disc was not formatted for my region.<br />All the information about the disc was there, I just didn't understand it all.<br />Not the sellers fault.
B0091LS07E|5.0|and so is this CD.  She's got it! I need to put in 12 more words to complete this review.
B007SGM084|5.0|Greatest love story I have read!!!  The hot sex only adds to it!!  Much more a love story than just erotic sex.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Super fun game to play. The only thing I wish is that you can play with PC users as well. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Runs great on my Droid Razr.
1849904251|5.0|The inside information on the making and the links between the show and the original stories were amazingly interesting, I have to say though, my favorite part was the cute sticky-note conversations between John and Sherlock! Perfect purchase for any Sherlock fan!
B0095VP8D4|3.0|A very good processor but the stock cooler isn't enough for cooling it. So you will have to buy another.
B007RTAR64|5.0|My daughter loves the hunger games but she does not really like to play with barbies. I got this for her anyway and it was a big hit, it comes with all the accessories (bow and arrow, arrows and arrow pack). She has it displayed on her desk.
0385341008|5.0|Book was recommended by a fellow reader friend, also a teacher. Sometimes they make the best reviewers! This turned out to be a terrifically DELIGHTFUL book and I loaned it out immediately after reading...can't remember who though! You will love this book :)
1451695195|5.0|I felt Eban Alexander is an honest author ... with a real NDE that changed his life.<br />Because he did not believe in the afterlife before this ... and because he is willing to tell his story regardless of the consequences ... to his carrer ... I felt he understood now what many of us NDE experiencers believe ... that ... its important for all of us ... especially the medical community ...  to understand why we are on this earth ... and he gets it now that he has had this experience ... and because of his book ... Hopefully many other doctors will come to the belief that life does not end when we die ... I believe it will change how doctors treat their patients ... and it will give relief to the multitude of dying people of this earth realm and also it will bring hope to the loved ones left behind ... when we die.<br /> This book is a great read ... I bought 4 copies and pass it around to my family.
0689835604|5.0|Baby I bought this for, LOVES pulling up the picture flaps to see what's underneath ! Right now she is interested in that feature the most. As she matures, she will love the language we use and begin to repeat the information we cover...I even bought another one by the author because she loves this one so much :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I hated for it to end. I Watched all three seasons in one week.  We are looking forward to Season 4.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|A classic that stands the test of time, and gets better with every read! I never grow tired of reading Elizabeth and Darcy's story.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|JerksIt Was Funny And Kinda Off Beat. I Loved The Characters In The Story Even The Ones That Are supposed To Be Jerks Were Likeable.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Absolutely loved this film.An epic heroic tale,depicted very realistically.Visually stunning ,with both beautiful scenery and the handsome Gerard Butler as Beowulf.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Amazing!<br />Stupendous! Amazingly amazinger than I thought!<br />Supercalafragelisticespialidotios the best in the world!<br />Amazingly amazing and I thought it was lame! But it`s not!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A stirring account of the spirit of humankind in the face of the hideousness of war. The story is told from the unique perspective of Death who comes to save the souls.  The last couple chapters had me in tears-- the deep grief of loss, the stupidity of war, the survival of hope.
0399230033|5.0|I am amazed at the negative reviews of this book by the people who claim that it has (and I quote) \\"too few words\\". I am also a full-time-job-holding-sleep-deprived-parent and yet I don't think anyone with an minimal level of intelligence, an even mediocre sense of humor, and a basic ability to extrapolate meaning from an image would have any trouble narrating the plot of the story. As a matter of fact I think that creating an original narrative to this story is one of the best things about this book - every child hears a special personalized version from someone who loves them.<br /><br />I can't get enough of this book. There so much love and generosity in each drawing and so much kindness in the way that all the characters interact with each other that I very much believe it has the potential to make our children a little bit better as human beings if they retain some of the wonderfulness of this book inside of them as they grow up.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I've always been a Trekkie.  being able to see the update version, whenever i want to is great.  the picture quality great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|what a fun game i played for like an hour the first night i downloaded it. not sure what else there is to say
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the episode that got me hooked!  If you aren't a fan...you will be after watching this.  GREAT SHOW!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read this for a second time shortly after the author was killed and it became very obvious how many times he referred to expecting to die and mostly in a bad way. The book was a true reflection and I feel a true soldier's way. May Chris rest in peace.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|After reading this book and hearing in the news about how China is hacking into our nation's many computer systems, I'm reminder how relevant Clancy's works are.  In terms of our global economic competitors, if only half of what Clancy writes about in his novels is plausible in real life, we have much to be fearful about.
8866131350|5.0|Moleskine makes an awesome product. Small and handy this planner fits snugly in your pocket or bag. People respect the use of a handwritten planner in this technological age. So if your gonna go with a planner. choose this one!
B00005LOUP|5.0|we always liked, and wanted to watch it prior to christmas tv time this movie and assumed we had it nice to have it in our collection great service
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I bought this game for my 4 year old grand daughter but my 11 year old grand son plays it also.  They both enjoy it.
1439190275|5.0|I was raised vegetarian, was small all my life and only rebelled a little by eating meat in my 20s. In my 30s I gained 70lbs with my first baby and never lost it. By 40 I had developed sleep apnea, sinusitis, seasonal allergies and tachycardia. I went to the gym religiously and tried weight watchers twice (followed it perfectly for months without any positive results). I had no success. I blamed myself. My biggest issue was that I was always hungry.<br /><br />This book changed everything. I ate more veggies following this guide than I did with an organic gardening veggie mom. For the first time in my life my hypoglycemic symptoms were cured (after a few weeks). Lost 35 pounds, and I am off all meds, and cured of apnea. My happiest thing is that I no longer loose my mind when I am hungry. It is just a physical feeling. I also noticed that the less carbs I have, the less stuffed up my nose gets. There is a direct correlation with inflammation for me. The other great thing is that I came away knowing that it wasn't my fault after all. I was just getting the wrong dietary advice.<br /><br />Thank you for a great book!!! (note: my version of the new Atkins sticks to real food only, paleo low carb high fat - I try to stay away from artificial and processed frankenfood as well as dairy - as it bothers my sinuses.<br /><br />in health,<br />Lisa
031236198X|4.0|This book is definitely a good read and makes you think about things in a different way than you would normally.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Fun game to play. Easy to &#34;turn&#34; the cube to find the matches. Colorful cubes that make it easy to find matches. Enjoy mah jong so this is very close to it.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This was a great price for such a wonderful show! I had never seen the show, but thought this was right up my alley! The boxed set is beautiful and very well organized. I also like that the movies made after the tv show are included! My husband even gets caught up in the story.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Very nice were is book six very nice were is book six very nice were is book six very nice were is book six
B006PTZNSY|4.0|This was a great buy from Amazon's lighting deals. I like Nicki Minaj, but only about half of the songs on this CD struck my fancy. I wish I had listened to a sample of each song before I bought the CD.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I have used this game, its very simple to use, intuitive without instructions.  A great way to spend a couple of free minutes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is a very good game with trains and a policeman on your tail. It is such a good game I could barely hold myself together when my kindle fire  had to charge and now I only charge it at night!!! THE BEST GAME EVER!!!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Not actively using this app on a daily basis.  Use it more to keep up to date with some contacts.  Don't use it for referrals or job search.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|I wanted to use bluetooth and not lose the connection while working out. This is a great product. I am very happy.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|This app has all the office word features you would find on a desktop computer, including cloud storage and printing capabilities.  Although I just needed a basic word application for my tablet for personal use, this one has really nice features--the applications on this app look and behave identical to the programs on the office computers at my place of employment.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Good tomplay 2, 3 or 4 people. You can teach young kids too as it is logical. Good board game!
B006GZ8OFQ|5.0|I did not know Wilkie Collins at all as an author.  It was a page turner.  I was so pleasantly surprised.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It's a cool hidden objects game. You see to get rewarded in the end. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah fooey
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is overall fantastic. The only upgrade I would like to see is more interactive things to do to care for the horse. The mini-games are great and I like the way you can earn gems without paying money.
0446547646|4.0|I thought it was a good book. Probably one I'd never read again but definitely worth to read it once.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I don't know I didn't finish yet because it didn't keep my interest. Some of it was good but I think it talked to much about his life.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Another great read, action , adventure couldn't put it down. I'm hooked on Lee Child,and the Jack Reacher books , I can't stop till I read them all
B00002E224|5.0|A really good movie for people who can sit and listen. There is no big action or explosions or gratuitous sex. Just talking and seeing how a relationship is formed and builds.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read this book fairly quickly as it's one of those books that makes you want to know what happens next. Unfortunately by the end I was just hoping the two main characters would be gone. The writer is very talented and put together an interesting story that obviously has drawn a lot of fans.  But for me, it's just not a book I'd recommend a friend to read.
1439153663|5.0|I just finished this book.  The only problem is that I stayed up late for nights immersed and could never find a good place to stop!!! I came to Amazon, searched Kathleen Grissom and was disappointed that she has no other novels. I was also TOTALLY shocked that such a wonderful novel was her first one!  I can't wait for her next one.  I do hope it's a sequel.  I already miss the characters.  Well done!!!!
1594488886|5.0|I decided to read this book because I thought The Kite Runner was the best modern novel I'd ever read. I never dreamed this book would be even better, but somehow it was. The despair and hope of these brilliant characters, spun together simultaneously in a way that rips at your heart, was overwhelming. I loved this novel - loved it! My heart feels somehow forever changed by being introduced to these women. Read it!
B00005KISG|1.0|We are not big movie buyers so we were unaware of what Region 2 means. We can't even use it!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Who don't like PAC-MAN. The image on the screen is crisp and clear just like the acrade game. I am still looking for some of the other games.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like the graphics and the changes made from Temple Run 1.<br />I don't do very well at it and get eaten alot but it is still FUN!
0446547573|2.0|I have read most of Sparks books and his writing talent seems to be going downhill.  This read like a book report.  I read through it quickly just so I could get to the end and put it down.  It was so predictable I could have written the ending myself but then I wouldn't have written such a flat one that went no where and was such a let down. I know he likes to write clean books but he needs to get with the times.  He doesn't need to write a 50 Shades but romance books need to have a little sex to keep them interesting.  And the idea of the guy's dead wife living next door-. come on!  I hate all the voodoo, ,magic, witchcraft and ghosts that seem to be becoming a part of today's romance novels. The romances are fantasies enough we don't read need the supernatural too.  This was the last of his books I will buy.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It takes a lot to keep me into a book that doesn't usually fit my style but James did an amazing job! I finished it last night and couldn't wait till we got Wi-Fi today to buy the second one then got sad when i realized i didn't have the credit to buy it. I actually started reading this from a school loaned kindle and when that one got broken i immediately went and bought it on my kindle fire. I absolutely LOVED it!
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Not as good as his 40's hits but a nice addition to his change over from rocker to relaxing crooner
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|It is hard to control and really boring. I don't suggest it to anyone. Except if you want to waste your time.
0307279189|5.0|I purchased this from a good friend's recommendation, but wasn't sure what to expect.  It was an informative, interesting, capturing read that blended story-telling, science, evolution, and a slant on the running industry that resonated with me.<br /><br />I actually liked it so much that I bought five additional hard copies from Amazon to send to some friends who I knew would enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm not a hard core runner, and this book isn't just for runners...<br /><br />Very good read!
B008220C56|2.0|I have read the novel twice and it is one of the best period pieces written.  That said, you will like the older versions of Anna Karenina better with Greta Garbo and Vivian Leigh (this is the best performance from a movie standpoint), than what was put on screen.  And the reasons I give these two movies made in the 30s and 40s is because the actresses captured Anna Karenina which was the major problem with this movie.<br /><br />I think Keira Knightly was too young for this role, Jude Law looked the role of her husband, but Keira was all over the place in this performance.  And I agree with many of the casting of Vronsky, the actor was out of his realm.<br /><br />I give it two stars for the lushness of the production sets and costume, that is about it.<br /><br />I have sat down 3 times to try to watch this movie and never finished it.  It was majorly miscast and the performances are bland, at best.  It could have been so much more, but if I can not even finish this movie (and I finished watching the 2012 bad performances of Red Dawn) then it speaks volumes of the disconnect and flow of this movie.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|We downloaded this app for my 9 year old son who is crazy about playing chess. He wanted something that he could practice by himself. He is not a novice player as he has been playing in chess club for two hours a week for almost two years and just competed in a state qualifying tournament. That being said, for the most part this is a good program but there have been times when he tells me that the computer is wrong ie it says it has check or check mate when it doesn't have it, other times he hasn 't made a move and it said the computer had check already. He is playing are the hardest level I believe so I am not sure if a beginner player would notice the glitch at all.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Good movie I mean it is Denzel Washington exciting thrilling nd tense not suitable for children but for a date movie night I wwould again!
B008PZZV8S|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and it is still a great Thriller. The actors are all very &#34;talented&#34; and the plot keeps you on the edge.
B000000ZGO|5.0|GREAT DVD
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this book was an adventure. I got stuck on it, and I couldn't stop reading. I think the author did a really great job. I would read this book again.
1449417051|3.0|The product itself was fine, but I thought I ordered the book.  Gave the calendar as a gift anyway and the person was disappointed as she had wanted the book.  My fault I guess. That's what happens when you wait too long to do something.
B002KKBV92|5.0|if i had more i would build the world and my daughter loves it. i would tell a friend about it if i had any
B003UYV08E|5.0|I'm biased and love this movie. Think its great and have watched it a handful of times. Definitely a must buy!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Coming from an intellectual this is a great book especially for linear thinking people. A great intro into what happens when we pass out of our physical body.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I borrowed this and read it online, so when I thought it was almost over I didn't realize I was only halfway through it. I formed my conclusions, mentally gave it 3 stars and started composing my review in my head while I skimmed through what I thought were the last few pages. I was growing bored, I didn't like the main characters and just wanted to find out where the body had gone to.<br /><br />And then I was whammied. I realized the meat of the book was just starting and it was like coming to the top of a tall roller coaster drop. I couldn't stop reading and it was exciting and I never expected the things that were happening.<br /><br />I thought this was an excellent book and in hindsight I don't even mind how bored I became with the beginning - the information there was necessary and the false expectedness of it really set me up to fully enjoy the last half.<br /><br />I found it to be so well written and the characters seemed like real people. I didn't like the husband and wife because of who they were, not because of how well they were written. So it kind of astounds me that I gave it 5 stars because it's usually very important to me that I like the main character in the book. I didn't really like the ending because it didn't satisfy me but that's just a personal preference. I think it was a very reasonable ending.<br /><br />I keep thinking I didn't like it (I guess because I didn't feel good when I was done reading it) but my strongest thought is wow that is one of the best written novels I've read in a long time.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book. I could really relate to parts of it as my sister died of lung cancer.<br />I could feel for her loss and everything she went through to put her life back together
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a very family oriented movie , shows the need for more love in our society and how we need to take time to be there for our familys  for we are certainly not promised tomorrow !!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This is a good book if you read the previous book<br />It was interesting to see how the characters grew.<br />I don't think it's as well written as the previous book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent series! Every episode holds your attention and keeps you wanting to see more of their lives! Can't wait until season 4!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was so Irish, it was like being in the country.  I really enjoyed that experience.<br />I found the orphanage experiences dismaying of course.  Was shocked to learn that the last of these was closed just a short few years ago.  But we need to know these things.<br />I really didn't forsee the conclusion, but it tied everything up nicely.<br />This was a good read.
B004LROUNG|2.0|I gave it 2 of 3 stars because it was slow too many times and the storyline seemed to get lost.  I know Grisham favorite is lawyers but this one seemed a reach.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've only had this product for a few days so any long term review can't be given but coming from a turtle beach x11 that I never had any problems with this is a tremendous upgrade. The sound quality was immediately noticeably better from the bass to the mid and high range sounds. Music was crystal clear and movies had a very nice surround sound quality to them. I primarily use them for gaming however and was the most impressed. The microphone functions excellent and the built in mute and mute indicating light are great extra features. The buttons on the headphones are also a great upgrade from the x11 and I ha no issues setting them up right away. The wireless range is as advertised and the build of the headphones is high quality especially for the price. I recommend these as an upgrade from prior headphones or as a must buy for an alternative to over priced gaming headphones you see online.
1574216988|4.0|I am still going through the book.  Since I enjoy tangling, it is a good reference when stuck on a design or tangle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft just because I just do and I just love minefraft especially my favorite thing is spinning eggs and diamonds.
0307341577|5.0|Wow! Another great one by Gillian Flynn. I found this read to be more powerful than her debut, SHARP OBJECTS and every bit original as her latest, GONE GIRL. A truly original idea based on a plot that fascinated me. As always, Ms. Flynn's characters are highly flawed--truly train wrecks you cannot rip your eyes from--yet the characters are what is most fascinating about the book. Literary, lyrical at times, I spent a lot of time on this one as I didn't want to miss a single word.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I first saw this in 3D in a theater, the 3D effects were so good<br />I got a bit of vertigo when scenes were looking down from great heights.<br />I obviously like the movie enough to have bought the DVD.
0385344228|4.0|I went back and forth on a 3 or 4 star rating for this one. Kept saying to myself: \\"This is very much like Presumed Innocent\\"--which threw me out of the read numerous times. The 4 stars are based primarily on the crafting of this novel and the ending. The active testimony, presented in transcript form, interspersed with a back story told in first person was quite brilliant. The last 25 pages astounded me, which does not happen often to this reader.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|An epic tale in three parts.<br />Special effects are great, moving the state of the art forward.<br />The extras showing how it was made were also very interesting
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty crazy. I like it though. The only problem is that sometimes it does not do what direction I want to go. You defenitly need to buy for your kindle fire. I love this game. The second reason I have problems is that a lot of your missions are to hard for some. So be prepared for hard missions! Bye!
B000YHG72E|5.0|I can't go through the Christmas season without watching Elf. Hilarious! One of my all time favorites! There are a few kissing scenes, but I still think it is acceptable for children
B005MJFA2W|3.0|This book came very highly recommended by several colleagues, and I usually love books about the psychology of work and so on.  For some reason I've really struggled with this one.  It's okay, but nothing I would shout from the rooftops about.  The principles are interesting, found it a little too repetitive.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|A good friend has been telling me about this show for years.  He recently gave me season 1 as a gift.  My wife and I were hooked.  Hard to explain but this show is full of surprises.  Acting is superb and story lines are amazing.  Every detail is important and everything ties together.<br /><br />This show is not for kids.  It is gritty, graphic and deals with the drug trade.  It is full of bizare, sick and funny situtations that have you on the edge of your seat.  It is also a realistic story of a family dealing with tough issues.<br /><br />Must start at season 1 episode 1 because everything is built off of that.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Some good concepts about how to trim the wastage out of your work day, from the 37 Signals Thought Camp.  Recommended reading for anyone who like me suffers the wrath of diary hell, spending most of their working day clearing emails or in meetings.  I took some real practical ideas from this book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Terrific book. Twists and turns, that only Stephen King can do. Brings you right back to the 60's'. One of the best books I've ever read.
B005D0TETK|5.0|Got this on a whim as a Christmas gift for my husband as a stocking stuffer.  He loves it and was impressed I found this without his input.  I usually just buy from his wish list because if I don't, I end up with something he already has.  Not this time plus it's a winner!
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|This book was easy enough to read I just don't think I agree with the main premises. I can't say I would recommend buying it but if you know someone who has it could be helpful.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|every song on here is a masterpiece - this album helped me in my recovery and shined a lot of good music all over the place.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Clean fun for the whole family. Our 9 year old daughter plays for hours and now has the whole family hooked.
B0015XHQTY|3.0|I think when they made this movie, they were looking to the put Inspector Harry Callahan character in another movie.  I've watched it before.  It's okay.  But then again, I love everything Eastwood and collect his movies.
0439023513|5.0|This is a great book series, very entertaining. I enjoyed reading the last installment of the trilogy. It was a quick read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Admittedly I got the book to prepare myself to see the movie, but it proved to be an incredible experience on its own. I couldn't drop the book and finished it relatively fast. I arrived late to the party celebrating this story but this time it really is better to be late than never.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I think Where's My Perry is a great app for people of all ages. I absolutely love this app, although it is a little too easy. I finished almost the whole thing in a day.
B003JYOEYM|3.0|George Romero once again proves his movies have more depth than the obvious. While not a stunning cinematic classic, this movie touches on a lot of the more subtle human behaviors that codify his earlier works. Worth a look, though not a movie to go out of your way for.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love This story, it wasn't the original Nichols Sparks book. It was sooooo much better. Everyone should read it! It's great!
B009GENZKS|4.0|While not a huge fan of the live action Resident Evil movies, the computer animated movies continue to show more depth and storytelling capabilities than many live action movies. Excellent technical quality, and a good storyline. Worth watching.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I bought this just for the sake of buying my first Kindle book not having any idea what it was about.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised and quite enjoyed it.

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel really deserve an Oscar. This movie is a slap in the face of these drunk and drivers pilots who doesn't care about others. wonderful movie.
B007THA4FI|3.0|There are so many characters in the first several chapters that I had a horrible time keeping straight the storylines for each character.  By the end of the book; however, I definately knew all the inter-related characters and their storylines.  The end came as a complete shock!  Enjoyable read.
B0035JGYZS|3.0|If you've watched the series, you'll have an easier time following the story than those that are unfamiliar with some of the backstory.  Although the film does a good job of filling in the gaps for those that are not familiar, it still relies heavily on themes that ran in the series and resorts to a couple of decisions that would not make sense even in todays computing environment (i.e. downloading Data's memories to an unknown android, etc.).<br /><br />That aside, it's an entertaining movie with sporadic action that keeps you somewhat interested.  I can't recommend this for everyone, but if oyu like the series, you'll enjoy this as well.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a very well-written story with beautiful and figurative language that describes the lives of Jamie and Lily. The alternate chapters depicting Jamie's sad childhood in an orphanage really elicits the reader's emotion and portrays a detailed account of a horrible truth that was the life of orphans in institutions such as those.
1582701709|1.0|This not the same as the original and it leaves out some of the \\"how to\\" aspects and examples.<br />I regret that I purchased this item.  I bought this for a gift which I won't give now.<br />It is not the same as the original and I didn't realize it before I purchased.<br />I made the mistake of getting the video too and that is also a revised edition.<br />My suggestion is to save your money and get the original Edition on Ebay.<br />I am really disappointed in these revised items, especially since the original was so very good.
0452295548|5.0|As I am on a fixed income, I borrowed this book from my library.  Now I plan to buy my own copy.  There are so many amazing insights that I know this book is one that I will want to return to again and again.  It is written for the layman--so those of you without a biology background need not fear--and though she does offer extremely valuable advice for professionals dealing with stroke patients as well as for those who live with stroke patients, her main goal is to impart to the world at large the lessons she learned with the entire left hemisphere of her brain winked out due to a stroke.<br /><br />Her insights would be incredibly valuable to anyone, from a right-brain artist to a CEO.  She was given an incredible gift the morning of her stroke; she is returning the favor by gifting the rest of us with what she learned.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Had trouble putting it down. Great characters. I didn't figure out the ending well in advance as I am accustomed to doing.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|There is a lot to like about The Descendants.  First, it stars George Clooney, who has become one of the best actors of the 2000s and 2010s with convincing performances like those in Michael Clayton and The Ides of March.  This go-round adds to the list of winning and memorable roles.  All are unique, but all uniquely Clooney.<br /><br />The man is a movie star, plain and simple.  He can cover the full gamut of emotions and affects from depressed to sad to annoyed to upset to angry, and everything in between.  In The Descendants he displays his acting chops for portraying sadness, confusion, rage, and remorse convincingly.  Although his protagonist is a faulted man, neglectful of his family and too focused on his finances and business, there is a reality and humanity that Clooney brings to Matt King.  With his universal winner personality and natural charm, Clooney makes King seem more burdened than burdensome.<br /><br />Second, you will feel transported to Hawaii.  Hawaii plays a big role here and one that only an experienced filmmaker could incorporate seamlessly.  The distinctive ukulele music, the lush tropical landscape, the omnipresent sense of separation from the mainland, the laid-back dress--all of these elements of The Descendants factor into painting a picture of a place that is very different from anywhere.  Different rules apply.  Lawyers don't wear powersuits; they sport goofy, floral short-sleeved button-downs.<br /><br />One thing that was striking to this Lower 48er is that, although Hawaii is perceived as a tropical vacation spot for most of the world, it is also a home to many people.  Along with being a \\"home\\" comes a number of generic and commonplace facets of the landscape that few consider.  There is rush hour traffic.  There are suburbs with cookie-cutter subdivisions.  Skyscrapers filled with offices dot the downtown of populated cities.  Most importantly, even in a green and temperate vacation climate, there are still places that its inhabitants go to escape from \\"paradise.\\"  The Descendants does an excellent job of bringing these realities to the viewer in subtle ways, like by incorporating a mini-getaway to a beach house on another island into the plot.  No matter where you live, even in a touristy place like Hawaii, the inhabitants still like a change of scenery.  Humans try to escape their day-to-day perspective by changing scenery to contemplate, refocus, and reinvigorate, even in places where the scenery is amazing.  Hawaii is no different, and this film drives the point home.<br /><br />Third, the complexities of family are incorporated effectively in a few different ways.  King's daughters are at different places in their lives.  One is a preteen, just getting a minor taste of the difficulty of growing up with peer pressure, expectations, rejections, and bouncing emotions.  Another is firmly and typically teen, exhibiting a rebellious streak that King is forced to manage and harness to his advantage.  He does so even without the help, and you could say the hindrance, of his comatose and unfaithful wife.<br /><br />The Descendants also creatively explores and highlights the dynamics of extended-family relationships and wrangling over inheritances.  Without giving away the resolution, a number of different and diverse relatives have their say in a decision that King is forced to make.  The film reminds us that we do not pick these people in our lives.  They are family, and we are stuck with them.  Some we will appreciate and embrace.  Others we will merely tolerate and neglect, or even outright reject.  When those family ties also are bound up with monetary concerns, legacies, perceived wishes of descendants, and the future of all concerned parties, it gets messy, testy, and there are no easy solutions.  We see all of this in play through Matt King.<br /><br />Finally, The Descendants takes a complicated story and makes it easy to get drawn in.  There is a lot going on.  An extramarital affair,bubbling teen angst, plotted revenge, inconvenient death, family strife, business ventures, not to mention lots of names to remember and cross-relationships.  In the end, you realize that the focus is Matt King and his discombobulated and imperfect life.  We only see a slice of it over maybe a period of weeks, but it is enough to paint a multifaceted, challenging, and realistic painting of the highs and lows of life.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The movie came out a week ago and I bought the book 4 days ago and just finished it. Like other sparks books it was easy to read and I couldn't put it down. However the movie probably won't be as good as the book because they never are. But none the less I will see the movie because it will be entertaining
B004NOCCEG|3.0|This acclaimed documentary might better be called a docudrama.  While the events depicted in the film certainly happened and happened within recent memory, the presentation offers strokes of conspiracy theory, shady doings, and express and implied criticism of the exorbitant and suspect wealth created by individuals making their living on Wall Street in the 2000s.  The high stakes financial bets that form the back-drop for the 2008 crisis were not dramatic per se, in the sense of them involving interpersonal quarrels or conflicted feelings.  Inside Job and the sub-prime mortgage debacle that it chronicles was about greed, folks.  Blind, take-it-while-you-can-get-it greed facilitated highly complex financial instruments.<br /><br />The financial instruments giving rise to the catastrophe, credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations being the main culprits, are tricky for even this finance major to understand.  Inside Job does an applaud-worthy job of breaking these obligations down to their bare components.  Simple diagrams do the explaining and do it cleanly.  I walked away feeling pretty confident I know the basics and could explain them to the average Joe.  (Full disclosure:  It did not hurt that I recently read The Big Short by Michael Lewis.)  The learning that comes from the rudimentary illustrations of how credit default swaps and CDOs work was enough for me to say \\"see this.\\"<br /><br />The average person probably thinks that professional athletes are overpaid.  Well, in Inside Job we learn that CEO salaries for Wall Street investment banks make Prince Fielder's massive long-term deal look like chump change.  The number $485 million stuck with me.  One failure CEO's compensation was near half a billion dollars!  And it was for one of the monstrous investment banks that ultimately found itself billions in the red due to taking extremely ill-advised positions derived from risky, contorted (worthless) real estate assets.  The company staggers away,barely with a pulse, while the CEO rakes in a tremendous payday.  How's that for maximizing shareholder value?<br /><br />The opening of the film does a poor job setting things up.  Why are we studying Iceland's banks?  Oh, yeah, deregulation.  Okay.  But what about Iceland's banking sector is like our own?  No clue.  Near the end the loop is supposedly closed on Iceland, but I didn't get it.<br /><br />I recommend this film if you can go in open-minded with nary a political thought in your head.  There is plenty of George W. bashing in a sneakily veiled manner, and it is possible to get sucked in without thinking about how the sub-prime crisis was festering and building for a decade.  Democratic administrations are also criticized, but the whole idea of the \\"inside job\\" seemed to point the finger of blame at the Republicans.  Really, the entire federal government is to blame for a lack of sufficient regulation, followed by a massive industry bailouts in the name of Too Big To Fail.  Inside Job does not seem to take a definitive position on the bailouts, but it squarely places blame for a lack of sufficient regulation on the politicians that bowed to the wealthy on Wall Street.  It is a thinker.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I am finding it SO helpful to see how long it is going to take to charge and also to see the amount of charge my Kindle Fire has!
B007FH9GA6|4.0|This movie leaves you exasperated.  The plot surrounding the toxic Vanger family is hard to digest, and the gloom, ultra-violence, and isolation that the two main characters experience are a downer.  Maybe that speaks to how good this film is; it brings you into its dark and twisted world, and you leave feeling dirty.  It did not give me nightmares, but I felt like I had been down in a dark hole for three hours.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is based upon an international best-selling trilogy that focuses on punkish cyber-sleuth Lisbeth Salander, played by an almost unrecognizable Rooney Mara (look her up after you see this movie to witness the transformation).  Lisbeth is waifish, pale, tattooed to the High Heavens, and a whiz with technology.  She also has a photographic memory and is supremely anti-social.  As a ward, she relies upon her custodian for funds to survive.  This becomes a problem when her lenient custodian suffers a debilitating stroke and she is re-assigned to a pervert that makes her perform disgusting acts for advances.  This is where her darkest and most violent side comes out, and some of the grizzliest violence in the film lies in two scenes involving Lisbeth and the deviant social worker that controls her purse strings.  You feel bad for Lisbeth because she has gone through a lot of difficulty in her life, but her retaliation is over-the-top and shows her taste for extreme revenge.<br /><br />Daniel Craig's character is not someone you feel bad for.  He is a jerk, self-interested, and not a very clever or perceptive investigative journalist.  When he gets caught red-handed doing something he was not supposed to be doing about 2/3 of the way through, I thought it was about time he got what was coming to him.  Complete aside: notice the annoying habit of how he awkwardly hangs his glasses off his face.  If someone did that while I was talking to them I would be too distracted to pay attention to what they were saying.<br /><br />I was expecting a lot from the score to this movie.  It was done by Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch, who scored the background music for The Social Network.  I felt like the score in The Social Network was a work of art in itself and effectively augmented the feel of the movie, so I anticipated big things here.  It did not not deliver in the same way.  There were still the beeps and boops and pounding bass of electronic music and some nice building sound drama, but it just did not deliver.<br /><br />This movie makes it seem like Sweden is an extremely depressing place.  Everyone dresses in dark colors, looking like hip and modern yuppies, it is always snowing profusely, and all the people in the film despise each other.  The landscape is an important element of the story--all of the Vangers live on an island that is cut off by a bridge.  It made me wonder whether the island itself, and the isolation it supported, led to the weird behavior by the Vangers.  In any event, this movie will not make Sweden seem like an attractive vacation spot.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this movie quite a bit.  I understand that the book was pretty complex, so putting it on film in a manageable (short enough) form is difficult.  As a stand-alone piece with no connection to the trilogy, this was not bad.  There was suspense and mystery, but some key links in the chain were not explained well enough to make me feel satisfied.  Rooney Mara's performance was impressive considering that she looks like a total freak and had to physically transform herself and go through some grueling abuse for the role.  Seeing that discipline alone was worth the price of admission.
B008220DIC|3.0|It is difficult to know what to take from The Master (2012).  There are very good, maybe even great, performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix.  But, the way the performances are combined in story is underwhelming.  While it has the look and feel of a potentially memorable film, it is a disappointment.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a truly lost soul.  You'll remember his name after the first half hour of the movie because Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character makes him repeat his name a half-dozen times.  Hoffman is The Master, Lancaster Dodd.  (You don't learn his name until an hour and a half into the film, I think.)  Quell and Dodd form an odd, dependent friendship.<br /><br />Quell is an alcoholic, the son of an insane mother and drunkard father.  He has personality issues, to say the least.  Not that he doesn't have talent--a talent for concocting strong, vile booze from whatever paint thinner or rubbing alcohol he can get his hands on.  He also has a mean streak that really shows Phoenix's acting chops.  A scene in which Quell and Dodd are locked in the county jail probably wins Phoenix Best Actor for his violent, unhinged tirade.  By the end of the film I actually felt bad for Phoenix, who must have developed serious back and neck pain from playing a character that is habitually lurching slightly forward, back hunched, arms on his hips, elbows out.  That's Quell's physical signature--creepy miscreant, outcast, loner.  To top it off, it is never clear whether he has a legitimate psychological problem that makes his anti-social outbursts beyond his control.  It makes Quell's journey difficult to relate to, and the film's circling-back-on-itself conclusion a headscratcher.  We never know if Quell is better off after the events we witnessed.<br /><br />Dodd is the leader of a cult.  Hoffman does a stellar job playing a big cheese that revels in being the pious, pompous mystic that the film never truly destroys.  In other words, wedon't get to peek under the hood and see whether Dodd has lingering self-doubt, or even whether he has many skeletons in his closet.  Amy Adams plays his supportive and steely-eyed wife, but she is so underutilized as a character that we don't learn much about Dodd through her, either.<br /><br />Dodd builds a Scientology-like organization called The Cause that engages in \\"processing\\" of adherents to work through problems from past lives.  The scene in which Dodd processes Quell is the bread and butter of this picture.  Quell breaks down emotionally through a series of well-executed flashbacks; Dodd presses him with a litany of patient, devastating, well-rehearsed inquiries.  This is two skilled actors milking a challenging, lengthy, intense scene for all its worth.  The payoff is real and helps to get the audience grounded.  However, the scene also builds expectations that Quell's paranoia and unhappiness will be resolved, either for good or for bad.  We never find out.<br /><br />This film is long (2 1/2 hours), but the last half hour seemed thrown together, leaving gaping plot holes and, frankly, it had me wishing that there was another hour to fill them in to create a message or moral.  The reunion in the last key scene harkens back to There Will Be Blood's \\"I drink your milkshake!\\" scene, but with a bizarre suggestion of a homosexual relationship between Dodd and Quell that is only hinted-at thinly earlier in the film.  Is Dodd gay?  Is Quell?  If either is gay, does it explain everything?  Um, no.<br /><br />When we leave Quell, he appears to have learned little from The Master.  The Master certainly learned little form Quell.  And we learn little from this movie, perhaps other than that two impressive performances don't add up to greatness when the story bringing them together lacks a hook.  This movie will not appeal to 75% of those that watch it.
B002VA5PHK|5.0|This is a great cookbook for amateur and professional bakers alike. The recipes are creative and delicious; and the instructions are easy to follow or modify.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the Kindle formatting is a bit wonky, and sometimes the pictures don't appear with their recipes, or font size is inconsistent. I tried changing the font size, but it seems to be a formatting flaw. I still like the book, though.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|This movie explores an aspect of the civil rights movement that I never registered: the plight of poor black housekeepers.  Not a thrilling premise, but stay with me.  It was an entertaining picture.<br /><br />The real value in The Help is not in its \\"message\\" or uplifting resolution.  It is the humor.  There are some good one-liners and carefully set-up punchlines that deliver mild, but reliable laughs.  The African American maids in the film have great personality and timing, and in some ways their body language and delivery make you feel for their struggle to find the humor in their awful lives.  And the spoiled-rotten stay-at-home white broads that take full advantage of their servants are such wild exaggerations of Southern belle busybodies that you have to laugh at the parody.  The humor it cutesy and simple, but I'll take well-placed and playful jokes over gross-out bodily fluid gags seven days of the week.<br /><br />A clever social hierarchy study goes on.  The movie reveals the behind the scenes perspective that \\"the help\\" in any institution, be it a church, law firm, place of higher learning, bank, or whatever, gets to experience firsthand.  The maids swap rumors and stories about the real and imperfect lives of their employers and gossip over all the dirty secrets.  Blending into the wallpaper as a  go-fer has simpleton entertainment perks.  This is one lesson of The Help, but as the servant you always have to keep your lips sealed and avoid the temptation to talk back.  Or to grab revenge, at least not until the time is right.  There is some sweet revenge in this movie, but I won't give it away.  All I can say is that anyone who has worked in the service industry will appreciate pulling a big one over on a rude and ungrateful customer, or, in this case, a snotty and unbearable employer.<br /><br />Another thought that occurred to me is how African American women went from being indentured servants in the mid-19th Century to being \\"free\\" but still less-thans in the mid-20th Century.  These women were not independent. They were highly dependent upon their \\"masters,\\" the wealthy, cozy, elitist Southern whites.  (The practice of leaving a servant to a descendant in one's will that is discussed in the movie is further evidence for how little the possessive and entitled mindset of the white ruling class had changed.)  I am sure the maids were paid a virtual pittance, although we never find out exactly.  It is clear that whatever they were paid kept them stationed in life as poor black folks, and that is the point.  They can't move up.<br /><br />Overall, this was an enjoyable period dramedy.  The centerpieces of this movie were the big, bold personalities of the maids, the dopey housewives, the historical backdrop of the civil rights movement, and the \\"up with people\\" closing.  Keep an open mind going in, and you will find some value in The Help.

B0032SQCQI|2.0|As weird movies go, this movie is weird.  I don't know how to characterize it.  Horror?  Science fiction?  Thriller?  Psychodrama?  All of the above.<br /><br />The premise is straightforward:  A black box shows up at your door.  It has a button on top.  If you press the button, one million dollars will be delivered to you.  Also, someone you don't know will die.<br /><br />But that premise leaves so many questions unanswered: Any negative consequences of pressing the button?  Who or what created this button box?  Why did they choose me to get this delivery?  Who will die?<br /><br />There are so many \\"What the...?\\" moments and flashes in this film that is going to be hard to catalogue them in 30 minutes.  Like Memento or Inception (but not quite to that extent), this movie requires a second viewing.  Why is blood dripping from the noses of some characters, for example?  Late in the movie there is a pretty substantial reveal regarding the peculiar goings-on that dot the landscape of The Box.  But, even some questions are left partially unanswered as the film closes.  I liked it.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz is a big star.  How she got involved in a weird flick that is painfully obviously based upon a science fiction short story is odd.  And her co-star is a James Franco knock-off, so maybe the producers went for him but had to get a look-alike as his stock rose.  In any event, Diaz and Franco-lite's life is what I would imagine for yuppies in the 1970s in the Washington, D.C. area.  He works for the government, NASA.  I don't recall if she even works or if that is relevant.  They live in a comfortable neighborhood surrounded by other comfortable folks.  They have one son, and the family seems close.  All is well.  But there is still that nagging, pestering bug in their ear for more or better.  More career success.  Diaz has a foot disfigurement that is embarrassing.  Like everyone in their suburban enclave, a little more money would ease a lot of their burdens.  They press the button.<br /><br />And then it gets freaking weird.  The film unfurls itself in one of the most peculiar fashions.  There are some scene cuts that show mysterious happenings, but we don't know why.  These mysteries are not revealed until much later in the film.  (One that sticks out is a flash to a motel pool where a large group of people are walking into a blindingly lit pool. Huh???)  What this plot technique instills in the audience is a constant, wondering apprehension.  Good stuff.<br /><br />The score also ramps up the creepiness and doom, which was effective at making my brain gears turn.  There were no Jack-in-the-Box, pop-out horror scenes, but that only added to the intrigue and dread.  I felt myself waiting to be scared silly, or for some gratuitous and gruesome violence.  It never came.  You know something big, ominous, and weird is happening in the background.  But what?  Who is pulling the strings?  I wasn't blown away by the answer, but it was an entertaining puzzle.
0316228532|2.0|Like most others I looked forward to reading this after the masterful HP series.  It almost seems like it was written by a different person, or perhaps was written before the HP series as her first book but now she was famous enough to get it published.  I suspect that she experienced some of these things and had these frustrations as a single parent, possible even a social worker, like the character Kay.  Everyone and everything in the book disappoints which at least explains why she would want to escape the Muggle world and create an imaginary land one for herself and her children where good has power.  It took me until page 142 to have a sense of what the book was about and possible another hundred pages to get to know some of the characters.  There is almost no character development and very little description of the characters so they are hard to visualize.  The narrative seems truncated too frequently by changing circumstances and individuals.  Like many, I struggled to keep various people straight.  In the end, the surprise plot being about computer hacking could have been introduced much earlier.  This book needed a decent editor.
B0068THAGY|3.0|Going in I did not know that this film was a science fiction picture, so that was an interesting surprise.  I also did not know that there would be a lot of nostalgic and coming-of-age-teen themes.  Again, a not unwelcome surprise for someone that lists American Graffiti and Dazed and Confused as favorites.  There was plenty to like about Super 8.<br /><br />Taking place in the late 1970s, the world we notice in the movie incorporates longish hairstyles, classic muscle cars, Coca Cola in bottles, and simpler times for youngsters.  Kids actually played back then.  They had adventures, got together to be creative, and had fun in real-time.  There was no Internet or text messaging to distance relationships.  The somewhat dorky and outcast group of friends in this film are into cinema and making their own ultra-low budget zombie flick.  The dialogue, plot, and \\"production value\\" of their project is simplistic and childish.  However, I could appreciate and recall the low level of sophistication that one has as a junior high student.  It was authentic and reminded me of my own efforts at being creative as an adolescent.  Every small-town kid with an artistic streak should be able to relate to this aspect of Super 8.<br /><br />With teen nostalgia, naturally, comes a love story.  It is not overpowering stuff or a main focus of the plot, but more of a cute and sugar sweet distraction.  Again, Super 8 hits the right notes to make you remember a far-off time when having a crush was a big deal.  It could make your summer.<br /><br />But what makes the season for the group of friends here is a mysterious train derailment and an even more suspicious clean-up effort by the United States Air Force.  The movie grabs you by the collar and takes an unusual turn after the crash.  I was not sure what was coming next.  Gory horror sequence?  Black hole opened to a parallel universe?  Government conspiracy?  A mishmash of all of those possibilities?  What comes out of the crash is revealed slowly and carefully, and with great storytelling skill.  Super 8 has style that is graceful, witty, never clumsy, and well-executed to keep you focused and interested.  There is even some light humor to break up the question marks.  Remember that this is a science fiction film, and you will suspend your disbelief and enjoy the fantastic story and classic feel of the way we move through it.  Otherwise, you might be disappointed at how improbable (impossible?) the reality of Super 8 turns out.<br /><br />I enjoyed the suspense, surprises, and explosions here more than the theme of loss that permeates the protagonist's psyche and closes the circle at the end of the film.  I felt the resolution was a little forced and cheesy.  But, one forced element of an otherwise entertaining, well-conceived, and well-executed film is forgivable.  Give Super 8 a run, and you will not be disappointed.

0007447868|3.0|I have to agree with most of the other reviewers that this was not my favorite book from the Song of Ice and Fire series. This book had my least favorite characters and I only completed it because I didn't want to give up that easily. Hang on for Book 5 and things will come together a lot better.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|I always knew it would end like that. You always have to go though something hard if what you want is worth it. Great book!

We joked about it not having any cool robots! :) But robots aside... it was friggin brilliant! We are really all connected!
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I read multiple reviews that stated the color was way off, bad picture quality, and not worth it on BluRay. I couldn't disagree more. The quality I witnessed was truly awesome. Crystal clear picture with dark blacks and sharp colors. The audio quality was awesome as well. Not to mention the story, I mean it's Jodie Foster for christ sake!!! Nuff Said~

B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like the way I can organize my notes and lists into books that I can see on the bookshelf.  I would like it better if there was a way to lock the app or even a book. If I lend my tablet to my kids they have access to my notes.  Just a thought.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I have tried several times to get registered for the youversion.  I have registerd 2 or 3 times, but then it will not allow me to sign in.

B00123AYNM|1.0|First off, this review is not a 1 star review for Porcupine Tree, or the music on this album. The album is a 5 star album hands down. The review is for the lousy job they did with this enhanced import 2 disc version I ordered and have sent back.<br /><br />I ordered this last week, got it in the mail, went to upload it onto my Itunes, no luck. It just sits there and does nothing. I eject it, reinsert it, itunes picks it up. I hit download and nothing, just sits there. Finally got it to DL the first song after several attempts, only to listen to it and the sound is all messed up. Sounds like an old LP thats been used as a scratch post from my cat.<br /><br />So at this point I just delete it. Go put it in my home stereo system, and it plays okay, but the first song is scratchy still. I skip to the second song, and it's perfect. I go back to the first song again it sound perfect as well. I pop in the second bonus disc, it's doing the same thing; scratchy, skip song, perfect, go back perfect again. I take it out, put the first in again and it does the same thing.<br /><br />So I emailed amazon to get a replacement sent out. Recieved it in the mail today, does the same exact thing.<br /><br />I have had enhanced import cd's before, and never once have I have anything like this happen to me. Finally just giving up on this worhtless POS cd and will buy the regular version without the extra bonus disc. Wish I could have gotten them to work at least once so I could know what I am missing anyways. Really frustrating CD, so if you live in America and are thinking of ordering the 2 disc enhance import version, think twice before you do.[[ASIN:B00007J36G In Absentia]]

B006TVQTHW|4.0|I prefer building my own computers, this way I can put the $$$ where there needed the most. Out-of-the-box computers have no or little upgrade room. The only issue I had with this box is the 2 120mm case fans that come with it. They dont offer much circulation at all. I replaced them with Thermaltake fans. Much faster yet very quiet. The case can hold 4 120mm fans for plenty of circulation. Never spend less than $10-12.00 for a fan. Remember, heat is your computers worst enemy!

B009NOVCSS|4.0|This is a great career spanning collection that could have benefitted from a few out takes or alternate versions of classic songs. The omission of some tracks like &#34; One Hit To The Body &#34; from1986 or &#34; Let Me Go &#34; from 1980 is surprising to me, and the fact that some tracks have been edited is disappointing. That being said, it's great to see &#34; You Got The Silver &#34; and &#34; Salt Of The Earth &#34; on a Stones compilation at last. The BBC recordings from their early years is a step in the right direction in terms of the Stones finally opening up their vaults, and in light of the recent &#34;Exile On Main St.&#34; and &#34;Some Girls &#34; deluxe reissues, there are some real gems out there. One of which, &#34; Plundered My Soul &#34; is included here....out of sequence. By placing this track on the last disc it shows that even though it was a doctored track ( newer vocals from Jagger and guitar parts from Mick Taylor added on in 2010 ), it still sounds like a song from their peak years (1966-72), and the other songs on this disc pale in comparison. Also included is a hard cover book of photos of Stones memorabilia, post cards and a Stones poster from the early 60's that's about as generic as they come...a replica of the 1973 Australia tour would have been a better choice. This is a big collection in terms of content AND physical size...it dwarfs other box sets. Here's hoping that Jimmy Page will do the Zeppelin re-issues justice later this year, and that one day the Stones will look at what he's done, and what Townsend has done with the Who re-issues and finally get it right...the clock is ticking.

0770435726|5.0|Excellent book. The author's flashbacks (and forwards) are an interesting way to keep the reader engaged.  Though I was mildly disappointed with the ending, I gave The Expats five stars and I look forward to more from this author.

B0037EPYLG|5.0|This is someone else's (and we do not know who) selection of what they think is the Cream of Clapton.  It may be used as a beginning album or just a synopsis for those that just want to have a Clapton sample in their library.<br /><br />Bottom line all these songs are on original albums and if you just happen to like this combination then there are no ringers or odd songs in there to just fill space/time.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|My fiance and I loved this movie - and we didn't even have kids with us - it was very cute and thoughtful and good for all ages.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|When I bought this book I thought it was going to be a simple love story, boy meets girl.  However, it ended up being so much more.  Through the book you feel the struggles he endures to get better and how it put a strain on his family/friends around him.  I loved his constant hope for the silver lining.  Truly enjoyed this story.
034580404X|5.0|This book was the best. I read the whole trilogy in just we days, i coudn't put the book down. I jsut wish it wasn't over i could read those books forever
B002LFVE4I|3.0|I wanted to watch this after reading that Julian Fellows of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; had written it. I expected the period details and accuracy that the film delivers. But Altman's improvisational style of directing, with constantly overlapping dialogue, makes the British accents almost unintelligable except in two person scenes. The story is an interesting and satisfying one, but the characters are too difficult to understand, and the relationships too convoluted to figure out.

B0012GMWCU|5.0|Yes, the Chess Box is the encyclopedia, recommended for those who want a more complete Willie Dixon canon. But this little collection is a fantastic sampler. No, it doesn't include the greatest performances of these tunes - which were often covered by more memorable or talented groups of musicians or by vocalists whose chops were better than Dixon's. But if you want Willie Dixon as he was, with one of his early musical groups, and you want a really representative sample of his work this a great record. Plus is was released by Dixon as he was starting to fight back for the legal rights to his songs and for justified financial compensation, so in that way it represents a historical chapter in blues history (he later won financial settlements from the publishing arm of Chess records, for example, as well as from Led Zeppelin and went on to help other black artists get their legal justice from the music industry).

B003JTHXOK|2.0|I saw The Notebook because my daughter wanted to see it while we were on vacation together.  Sappy and predictable, I thought, but she liked it.  After recently hearing Scott Simon interview Nicholas Sparks I was a little intrigued, and somewhat impressed, by him so I figured I'd give his work another shot, just for some light wintertime entertainment.  It was just as uninspired, but the real bomb fell in the incredibly silly last few pages.  People really like this stuff?  I rate it &#34;I don't like it&#34; instead of &#34;I hate it&#34; only because I did bother to read the whole thing.

B007REV4T8|5.0|Caught Skyfall in the theater when it debuted in November of 2012. Absolutely couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD to add to our Bond collection. Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet, in my opinion, and I love that this film delves a little deeper into the personal life of Bond. Without giving anything away, it's a must see for any Bond enthusiast and it lays the foundation for Bond plots to come if you're new to the spy world!

B008TRUDAS|4.0|Layken has just moved to Michigan from Texas(along with her mother and younger brother) after the sudden death of her father. Upon arrival she meets Will, her next door neighbor, who she is instantly attracted too. Will feels the same way about Layken... but then suddenly that potential is shattered: Will is Layken's teacher. Now they have to try to push aside these feelings, while dealing with a lot of other obstacles that get in the way.<br /><br />Oh gosh, I don't even know what I'm going to say about Slammed. I find it really hard to review contemporaries because so often a lot of the major plot points are further along in the story, and can also spoil the story if talked about because they are not initially revealed. I'll try to do my best with leaving this as spoiler free as possible.<br /><br />I really liked Lake as a character. I thought she had the perfect reactions for an 18-year-old high school student. Slightly dramatic, but she also had a very good head on her shoulders. She was strong, independent and a little bit stubborn. I also adored Will. He was so sweet, sincere, and I loved his emotional reactions. I loved how the majority of the time he thought was his heart and not his head although he certainly tried. I actually loved all of the characters, Eddie, Julia and the two brothers. The character building was great and I felt a strong connection to the characters almost instantly.<br /><br />When I looked back at my notes one of the first things I wrote was, \\"Ugh. Insta love\\". That was my only problem with Slammed. It felt really sudden, they went from meeting to being in love... within a week. I didn't care anymore, come the end of the book, but initially I thought it was really rushed and a bit intense. The play out of the romance counter acted that though, and I ended up loving the intense relationship between Lake & Will.<br /><br />The ending was absolutely heartbreaking for me. I don't want to ruin this as it's a major plot point, especially for the second book but I was in sobs at the end. Just be prepared.<br /><br />Slammed was my second Colleen Hoover book and it secured me as a fan of hers. She is an amazing writer and has the ability to hook you into her stories. Her character building and writing style leaves me crying for more every time.<br /><br />In summary, I really enjoyed Slammed. It was a nice refreshing romance, with serious topics but carried out well, and it leaves you craving the second book, Point of Retreat.
1451695187|5.0|This is a powerful narrative of a neurosurgeon’s contracting meningitis and having an after death experience.  Warning: This may change your philosophy on religion.<br /><br />The odds were greatly against his survival. Relatives were told, if he survived, predictions were he would be a vegetable from this brain eating disease.  His family held his hand on 24-hour shifts and even consulted with a channeler.  Suddenly on the seventh day, he rose up and began speaking.  He recovered fully enough to function normally again and was declared a miracle by his own medical community.  The difference between this after-death experience and others is that a surgeon wrote it.  Previous to his own experience, he had heard about it from patients, but only gave them polite lip service as to their credibility—until he went to &#34;heaven&#34; and returned.<br /><br />The message he brought back is love is the purpose of life on this planet.  He also learned there are many other heavenly universes—something science has already begun to prove.  Perhaps we are like a caterpillar that sheds one body to go onto another one but is transferred to another universe.  Whatever your beliefs, it is a provocative read and one you can can’t easily put down, figuratively or literally.
B00A81MV3U|2.0|Wasn't quite the touch down I was expecting, Someone may have fumbled with this one.  I went into this movie with such high hopes and enthusiasm and came out feeling a bit cheated. Thank Goodness my movie date was all that I had hoped for or the afternoon would have been a disappointment.<br /><br /> After hearing so much about  this move, I anxiously went to see it. I'm not sure why there was so much Bravo's about it.  I came out of the movie not as impressed as I had hoped. Its a flick about a dysfunctional  family and  a  their emotionally disturbed son who  has been court ordered to spend some time in  mental institute after beating his ex wife's lover.  Pat, played by Bradly Cooper plays the part of a man who had a break down due to his wife cheating on him and was sent to a mental institution  for his anger and bipolar issues.  Upon his release, he get to return home to his parents home with the condition he stays away from his ex wife and continue his out patient treatment care.<br /><br /> Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, is emotionally disturbed in her way, yet functional in the real world had the most strength in this movie. She played her part as a tuff cookie kinda gal who doesn't give a hoot about what others think or say, and develops feelings for Bradly Cooper.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro plays his father and Jackie Weaver plays his mother, or should  I say was that  Salley Struthers?  Upon  Bradly Cooper's return to his parents house, everyone seems to be walking on egg shells.  The only responsibility Pat seems to have as an adult  is to jog around  the streets in hopes to keep his head clear, and take  his meds. The one thing that seems to motivate him to stay focused is the thought of being able to speak to his wife once again and hoping to woo her back into his arms. His parents afraid to speak their minds in fear of triggering off the unstable jogger are walking around on egg shells afraid to approach him with many matters. Robert DeNiro, a football fan wants to spend time with his son  sitting and watching  the game on the television, but he son hasn't a interest in this, the son is  more  interested in jogging around the streets wrapped in a hefty garbage bag passing his ex wife's house in hopes to get a glimpse of her.  Jacki Weaver seems to  have not much to say in this movie she just kinda stands around with a look of constant turmoil and confusion on her face.  During Pats jog, this is where he runs constantly into Tiffany who jogs with him. They first  meet and show no interested at first..  As they get to know each other, Tiffany  woos him in by asking him to be enter a dance contest with her, in return, she will get a letter to his ex wife with out he courts knowing about it. Things start to take a turn from there on in,  DeNiro starts believing in his son recovery and puts his money where his mouth is and bets on the football game. Tiffany starts believing in Pat's recovery and put her heart where her mouth it and enters them both in  a dancing contest. Jackie Weaver, well, Im not sure what she belived in, but I believe she was Sally Struthers in a past life.<br /><br />This movie was weak in many areas, but what I did like about it was the fact that it attempted to show how  many dysfunctional family there really are in this world. Sometimes life doesn't always have touch downs. We fumble, tackle each other, call time outs and on a good day, huddle around each other, but at the end of the day we are all on the same team.

B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|The movie is great however the quality does not feel like blu-ray AT ALL. I own several blu-ray movies and this one has the worst quality out of all of them. The image seems poor and small circles that make up the images are visible. This kind of quality would be understandable coming from a DVD but not a Blu-Ray movie. i gave 1 Star because the movie is great, just the image quality is poor.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. Just downloaded it, and it's very addicting. It can become challenging after awhile, but it starts off easy. Love it
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really got lost in this story and couldn't wait to find more from this author.  Would love to see this made into movie.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Some very interesting analysis on why people are successful.  Young Canadian hockey players, Bill Joy, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, some geniuses, airline pilots, etc.  I'm just over half done with the book, but it's an a pretty good read.  I'd recommend it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is enjoyable on many levels. For those who desire to have a better understanding of their own feelings, work through the loss of a loved one, and embrace the wonders that the outdoors can provide this book will move you.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I got it for my daughter to play on my kindle.  I ended up getting addicted to it instead.  Fun game, but can be addictive and mind numbing.  If you need something to pass time, it's a good option.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|I purchased this battery as a back up for when I video with my Nikon1.  It is exactly as expected as it is an original brand battery.  It worked just fine. With one battery, I was able to tape two and a half basketball games and had the second to replace during half time so I wouldn't run out.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read the entire book, but have no desire to read book 2 or 3.<br />I can't imagine what more he could do to her to fill 2 more books.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|the story line is good and the graphics are great but the zoom is pretty  much useless on my kindle fire. also the tap response is slow. most of the h.o.s are so tiny theres no way you can find them without being able to zoom closer and the hint is very slow to recharge though i would rather not have to use it so much. disappointing for g5.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|there was all chase scenes and all of them ended with an explosion James bond movies just keep getting worse and worse.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best thing ever? A zombie movie that NEVER ENDS!!! This season is much darker than the last 2, but I am still absolutely hooked.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not an avid reader of Stephen King books but this one caught my attention since I am a Kennedy &#34;junkie.&#34;  It grabbed me from the beginning and did not let go.  The premise is an interesting one and the book is well written with great character development.  King raised lots of possibilities about what could happen if you were able to change one second in history and the ramifications were extraordinary.  This book did not contain any supernatural or gory situations as many of King's books do.  It was actually thought provoking and the fact that it included many details about the Kennedy assassination really intrigued me.  I would definitely recommend this book!
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I am JG's biggest fan. No, seriously, I am. I learned Italian listening to his early songs. My kids and grandkids know his songs by heart (they're also sick of me listening to them year after year).  So after this many years of hit after hit after hit... what the heck happened?  I swear, I kept clicking through the songs thinking.. 'well, surely I'll like ONE of them'. But I don't. Not one. Not only do none of the songs do his voice justice.. who picked these songs?? Even the one I thought I'd like, which is an old Judy Collins favorite &lt;the moon's a harsh mistress>, sounds like a really bad kareoke version. Did I just say that about Josh Groban?? I did.. because in the middle of one verse he does one of those asides like an old Wayne Newton \\"Oh, yes I did..I tripped and missed my stars..\\"  I nearly ran off the road in my car when I heard that! All in all, it sounds like a bunch of people got together in somebody's basement and just picked up some old tunes and threw them on a disk.<br /><br />I'm still a fan.. and I'm still listening everyday to Closer, Illumination, etc..but I won't ever buy another whole album without listening to samples of every song first. Who'd have thunk it?  Josh.  I'm disappointed, but I still love you.  Love US, your loyal fans, enough to keep putting out top notch albums. This just isn't one. If it weren't on my iPod, it'd be in the trash.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Muy liviano y rápido de leer y con gran aporte a la vida. Lo disfrute en todo momento, lo recomiendo
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my daughter; sharing a good walk down memory lane.  Beatles done well for a new generation of listeners.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It lays it all out for you.  From telling you your batteries percent remaining, how long you have for a variety of tasks, to how long it will take to recharge the battery.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great and easy to read display.  Great for basic calculations. You are able to see the last entry, so you don't get lost if you get interupted.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Liked how she told the story through a diary. The story is steamy and dark. It is an easy read.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Just couldn't go wrong with this.  It's funny and dark and Sam and Dean are easy on the eyes.  Love it!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Yes, I am a bit of a Trekkie. Only in that I've watched the original series, TNG, DS9 and Voyager :-) This movie takes a few liberties with some of the characters, so true Trekkies might squawk. But, for pure entertainment value and special effects, I can watch it over and over again, and am!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading Colleen's first book I was very excited to read Hopeless. It is a story that captures you until the end. Enjoy.
0345529057|5.0|I bought the set. I couldn't stop reading the 1st book and I am a good ways into the 2nd now. There is good dialogue, descriptions, and action.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|very interesting take on a future I hope is nothing like what we really have in store. It Is even more interesting after seeing how the rest of the story unfolds in the Shift series
B001TODCII|5.0|I love the story line. The best part is when Liam Neeson speaks on the phone to the person in Paris.
B006O3MU96|5.0|My seven year old grandaughter loves this,  and she's really good at it  She already had the regular doodle jump.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This is a great Jack Reacher story,  Of course Jack Reacher never does anything the easy way; it's always the hard way!  This a story about a kidnapping with qa surprise ending.  If you like Lee Child's Jack Reacher character, you'll love this one.
B001AITH50|5.0|This is a great adaptation from the book, if not a great stand alone movie! Star studded cast and absolutely riveting!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|An unbelievable story of survival.  I did think the ending was a bit rushed after all that Pi went through to survive; it was as though no one believed him.<br /><br />I continued to read because It is incredible PI could survive.
B00933JF74|5.0|a very addictive game if your in to the whole city building type games. there just needs to be more quests and maybe a better explanation on how buildings work together.
0307744434|5.0|Loved this book! It was magical, and I found myself wishing I could actually be a part of Le Cirque Des Reves in some way, if only for one night to experience all it has to offer. I couldnt put the book down, and when i had finally turned the last page, I was sad that it was over. I wanted it to go on and on forever so that I could continue my love affair with the night circus. I felt a part of the wonderful world Erin Morganstern created and wanted to continue to be a part of it. The writing was spectacular and I only wish there was more.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|one of the best games I've ever played.. Complicated enough to keep you interested and involve enough strategy, but simple and quick enough to appeal to broad audience
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great Nicholas Sparks novel,  I could not stop reading. I really do hope this is made into a movie.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|seems to drag on a bit more than 1 and 2, but still brilliantly done. highly recommended, stick with it
0142002038|5.0|received quickly packaged well as described good price
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It's such a ridiculous arrangement, but I really liked it. Seems too often marriages start out with love, but continue on as an arrangement of sorts. This books starts with an arrangement that ultimately turns to love. I anxiously waited for the characters to admit to themselves and to each other they loved each other.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|Enjoyed this series for its character development, it's wacky storylines (and characters, for that matter) and Matt Smith's superb acting.  Looking forward to checking out season six on Prime!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Wonderful, It Was Indeed A Great Musical, It Won 8 Academy Awards Including Best Actor: Rex Harrison, Best Director and Best Picture of 1964
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is the absolute best!!!!!!!!!!! some people complain about the gems, but its no problem if you have patience! I'm on level 30 and I haven't bought a single gem! I mean seriously people! get over yourselves and the gem &quot;problem&quot;! you have to get this game!!!!!!!! its the BEST!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me wanting to keep on reading from beginning to end and I couldn't have predicted the ending
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is very well put together. Packed full of distinguished studies on the topic, it will definitely make you think.  Whether or not you decide to believe it 100% percent, it is worthy of being read because it will spark thought provoking topics that should not be ignored.
B0027MJU00|1.0|This book is a very disturbing read.  Not one I would recommend to my friends.<br />I almost couldn't finish it.
B00138KKP8|5.0|I love this album.  He has a way of drawing you in. I could listen to it over and over.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We absolutely love this show! Just started watching it this year and we cannot get enough! Not even in to zombies usually but this is so much more than that!
B003G4IXBK|3.0|I didn't get rid of my vinyl when I started buying CDs years ago, and I'm glad I didn't as over the last several years I have been reacquainting myself with my collection and my love of the sound. After playing my Three Friends Gentle Giant album I started rounding out my collection of Gentle Giant LPs. Imagine my delight at finding a relatively new addition. Long story short; In a Glass House compares unfavorably to Three Friends. The vinyl is heavy and appears to be of good quality. The album art is interesting. The mix is terrible with vocals taking a back seat to everything else, which is a shame as Gentle Giant typically has thoughtful and intriguing lyrics. The sound is brittle, lacking depth and warmth.<br />When I listen to Three Friends, I hear cleverness in service to the music, the combination of  different meters, changes in dynamics and keys that embellish and enrich the message. In In a Glass House, the cleverness seems to me to be contrived. If you are thinking of purchasing this LP I suggest Three Friends, instead.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Every once in a while they get it right and create a great series like Fringe, where it all just comes together the way it should.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wow what an interesting book. Kept my attention the whole time. Now I cannot wait to watch the movie and see if it followed along with the book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty good graphics, the energy may run out quicker than expected but other than that its a great game if your looking for a on the go pet with less work.
B0098460O4|5.0|It was just what I had wanted originally and would give this a high reccommendation to all who asked.. Love the music..
B0063IH60K|5.0|my first try at downloading games. easy and fun. plan to check out more. you made it so very easy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|On the edge of my seat the hole time. Wish I were a bit younger!!!<br />Good for young married couples.
0060557818|5.0|I love Neil Gaiman books, so I might be a little biased.  A wonderful book, very exciting, good story, wonderful characters..  Any chance of another one?
0812975219|5.0|There are flaws and lapses of logic in a lot of the arguments, but that doesn't change the fact that this book has drastically shifted my perspective of the world and has affected my daily decision-making (for the better) since I've read this. It teaches you what's not worth getting anxious over, etc. and how to give oneself more peace of mind.
0307346617|5.0|This book is so much more than just a story about zombies.  The individual stories show lots of variety of humans and humanity.  I think it would've made a great movie, but unfortunately has been changed so that it can be an action movie with scary zombies.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I never get tired of this game it challenges you no matter how many times you go back and try doing it to better your score.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Item as described, brand new. This is their first album, it different from their other Albums. I recommend this CD.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I can't believe that I waited until now to read this book.  If you haven't read it yet.  You need to.  I wish that there was more adventures of Tom Sawyer.
B001TD1XWG|5.0|item as described and brand new. great album, I would recommend this CD to anyone. that wants lil wayne albums.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I thought the history of flowers was interesting. I had never thought about where the meaning of flowers came from.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Item as Described, Brand New in retail package. This is a gr8t Documentary of the greatest, Rock band of all time. for any Metalllica fan. if you would like to add this to your collection of Metallica things then, buy this!
B0086700CM|2.0|This is a little to far on the dark side for me.  I am sure someone out there will enjoy it.
B001NJY56M|5.0|item as described, brand new.  I collect records, so this is a must have for me or for anyone who likes MCR.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Can't say much about this game other than it must be for the young at heart.  Have at it ......Seek and conquer.......get that angry bird!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story is amazing.  The author really makes you feel like you are right there with the characters.<br /><br />You should read this book.  It doesn't disappoint.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|Perfect for my star wars fan but would be nice if it it came in large.  It was a hit.
0316381357|5.0|I read this book YEARS ago when I was too young to understand a lot of what was said in it.  I've read it since then but it's been awhile.  I was glad to have found it again and in such good shape.  The book is a great read for anyone that has seen the movie (or not) and sheds a light on how things were in different places in different times and how much things have changed and not changed.  Of course, it's supposed to be a novel but have read other details about the author that it was based on a true person.  That makes it even more satisfying to me.  I was mesmerized by the Catholic nuns that taught us in school and that's where my fascination with this book began.  It's really a great book, no matter what your religion or faith is.
B003YL4L0W|1.0|I have always liked her books until now. If she continues to use filthy language to get the message across, I am done with this author.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is wonderful smart television viewing! My husband and I will be waiting with baited breath until the next season.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is a very good one but it is pretty easy to beat.  i haven't played it in some time but may go back to it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Greetings followers of Greco-roman stories! Riordan keeps you spellbound. CAN'T wait for the next book! I would highly recommend it!  FIVE out of 5 stars!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Some of the levels are too easy and some are almost impossible unless you use one or more of the &#34;power-ups&#34;.  I think this is just a ploy to get us to buy these power-ups.  Also how can one acquire &#34;feathers&#34; if one does not buy the Space Eagle?  I am something of a purist and I want to solve each level without help.<br />.<br />Also, I have searched and searched each of the first two episodes, acquired three stars at each level but I cannot find all of the pineapples (14 of 15) or bananas (9 of 15).  What am I doing wrong?<br /><br />Other than these minor issues, I love the games and play them every night to keep my mind and reflexes fresh.  I am 68 years old and need all the help I can get.<br />Thanks
B0052FDRI0|5.0|I got this one after talking to my 19 year old son about the band.  It ROCKS!!!  I'm an old-school metal-head from way back myself and when I saw these guys doing it up and rocking like the bands I grew up with in the '80's I had to get it.  I must say, I'm impressed!  Keep the fire burning BVB!!!
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I believe this is their best work yet. I like almost all the tracks on the cd. My favorites are: I was a fool, Shock to your system, Drove me wild, Love they say, Closer, Etc. Etc. Tegan and Sara keep getting better!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Got this one when it was on sale when it was first released.  Great pop album!  It's not Hendrix or Floyd by any means but a great listen when you just want some good jams to kick it with your friends.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Stick tennis is an awesome discovery for me.  I have played tennis for over twenty years,  and this is the next best thing to hitting the courts.  Love the instincts of the players, pace of the matches.  Kudos to the developers.  Keep up the good work guys!
B000002MG1|3.0|This album was not the one I thought it was when I bought it, but my bad.  Still a great album and it was sold and shipped exactly as it was advertised.  Thanks!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Kssmebsuper logft by eyehdhfhchfbhhhhhhhh j jb h h h h.  H hjj j h hh h h h h.  H
B004R2DS9C|4.0|My grandson and his friend loved this.  &#34;Where can I buy one?&#34; he said. My grandson said, &#34;Thanks grandma,&#34; with a huge grin. He especially liked the playmat  I am not sure how much he was buying-in to my intentions of using it to help keep his room clean.:-) Time will tell on that one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has done it again, this is right up there wirh the Notebook. Can't wait to see the movie.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Loved Lost, now I can watch it anytime I want with the complete collection. It has all of the seasons tied up in a neat little package. The little knicknacks are a perfect addition.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I also enjoyed beautiful creatures. It is very entertaining and well written. I am to read the next book
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|First of all the editing sucked in this film. The story did not make any sense with the resident evil films or stories. It seems that Paul Anderson is putting things in from the video game that do not make any sense to the film franchise, it makes the viewer wander what happened and how did they get there. There are more questions in his film then there are aswers.
B007NZQU72|5.0|Many of us are born with very high awareness of our own senses and those of others. This is a good thing, but in this world it can be a difficult load to bear as it is mis-interpreted by most people as being &#34;shy&#34;, withdrawn, touchy, moody, etc. This book is an engagingly written overview that would vastly help parents, schoolmates, teachers, and society at large to appreciate the challenging gift of being a Highly Sensitive Person. Most importantly, it helps &#34;HSPs&#34; understand ourselves better, which is in itself a most powerful tool for interacting successfully with partners, careers, society at large, and our own life goals. This book should be required reading in High School/Junior High &#34;Social Studies&#34;, much less college psychology courses, as well as every parent. A truly groundbreaking book, and captivating to read.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|this film did not only have a great story but the animation was amazing. Pixar did it again with another amazing peice of work. This film had things for kids and adults, and gave you somthing to think about and laugh about.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Really loved it, couldn`t but it down for two days. Suggest it to people who like thrillers and surprising endings :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching this mid way season 3. I was so hooked that I've gone back and watched both season 1 and 2 now.
B00797MB0O|1.0|It was very slow and very boring.  I couldn't even watch all of it.  It's about a woman who decides she wants her old boyfriend back who's happily married with a child.  Don't waste your time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing! I love this series keep me on the edge of my seat couldn't put it down. Highly recommended reading!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Never ceases to keep me entertained and always a surprise around the corner!  Have seen thru the 3rd show in Season 3 - can't wait to see the rest!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My son and nieces love this game! Great to take on shopping trips to keep them occupied. Would recommend this game to everyone with children that have a love for animals!
1416550534|5.0|The House at Riverton was my first Kate Morton novel and it will definitely not be my last.  This book hooked me in from the first page and obsessed me.  The love story in the center twisted my heart so that I was devastated when I got to the end.  Even though I already knew who died from the beginning, it still did not lessen the impact when I found out the whole story.  Once I finished, I wanted to read it over again and I did!<br /><br />If you love historical novels, if you love gothic, mysterious stories, if you love writing that's rich and evocative  - you will love The House at Riverton!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Great product, but the demo period is pretty short. Just buy the full version, because a ten minute trrial isn't enough.
B0050BPJ50|1.0|Very predictable pop...songs sound like they were developed by a computer program...lots of similarity in tempo and tone. Absolutely a snooze fest.  Don't bother.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game, works with phone upright or tilted, totally free... Definitely one of the best Spider Solitaire games in the app store.
B000002KZ6|5.0|First off, the music rocks.  Put it on and get ready to move around.  Secondly, it shows a maturity in terms of content. Musically they had been adding more rhythm and world beat sounds and that reaches a peak level that they never achieved again. The lyrics for their music had always been a bit esoteric, and that continues, but it's somehow seems easier to relate to. The songs are fully formed. Like many bands, their career follows an arc, and in my case this was the apex of that trajectory. It still sounds great, hip and it still rocks, 30 years on.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Most of the time - but not having to see his ugly mug or lame acting made this movie somewhat enjoyable.  The story was a bit uneven - it is not at the level of a Toy Story - but it's ok.
0345528581|5.0|I am recommending this book to people left and right as if I am on commission for Mark Lauren!  This book is so informative, practical, and gives you great guidelines for how to use the techniques in this book to keep improving and challenging yourself for decades to come with never a dull moment.  And all that in not more than 20-30 minutes, 4-5 days a week.  It's great for men and women!  I highly recommend it!
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Denzel is AMAZING in this movie which keeps you on the edge of your seat AFTER the plane crashes! The theme - damaged people, doing the right thing, and my personal favorite - your life is trying to tell you something and it will keep escalating the consequences of bad decisions until either you get it or you self-destruct.  Anyone who has loved someone with a substance abuse problem will appreciate the heartache caused but the chance at redemption is something Americans just love - and will love in this movie as well.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|After struggling with various wireless Access Points and routers for a few years, I finally got this AP and a gamer router, and have had solid results for over 2 years now.  The problem was that we have too many IP devices in the house (16 at last count), and most of them are wireless.  This new setup has been working solidly with only one or two resets necessary in the last two years (and that was only when one device had problem connecting, while all others continue to work fine).
B00943SQCI|3.0|I remember the original TV show scared the heck out of me...<br />Johnny Depp does his best to capture the character of Barnabus Collins and it was fun - but again the writing was a bit uneven and a little to chaotic at the climax - but ok.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|It becomes an awful harlequin cheesy romance novel.  Save yourself the money, it wasn't compelling enough for me to invest in the trilogy. Just back away from this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive...every time I loose I end up pushing play again lol good  to play with friends when you would like to be a little competitive!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was well told and very believable.  The technical jargon was just enough to keep you interested but not drive you away.  I would recommend this read to anyone.
B0028IDXDS|3.0|I bought a second monkey wubbanub after a friend gave me one we loved. Sadly, the new one I bought was neither the same size nor plushness as the first. My guess is it's due to manufacturer or production time differences, but the new one was about 30% smaller in length and stuffing. The fabric was also inferior. The pacifier was the same, though.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I love to play solitaire but this has an ad at the start of every new game. Sometimes the ads are not easily closed. So love solitaire ...hate the ads!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Liked this book very much. It is cleverly written through the perspective of the family dog and is funny, suspenseful, and touching. If you are like me and normally avoid animal stories at all costs because there is normally some horribly tragic event that happens (I believe this could be remnants of the torture &#34;Where the Red Fern Grows&#34; put me through in middle school) - fear not! You will cry, but in an inspirational way. :)<br /><br />I also wasn't sure how I'd do with the racing aspect since I don't follow racing as a sport at all, but I loved the comparisons the author made between life and racing. Overall, a great read, especially if you understand the psyche of dogs.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is just Ok. I find it kind of boring. You gotta purchase more coins if you want to get further...well at least for me.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I absolutely love this episode.  Ricardo Montalban as Khan, gives the performance of a lifetime.  He is electric on screen.  Great story!  An additional bonus is the fight scene with Kirk and Khan at the end of the episode.  It is hilarious!  The stunt doubles look nothing like Shattner and Montalban!  Great entertainment and highly recommended!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like this game. Not alot of bells and whistles but hey its free. No ads, simple and easy to play.
B002EMESSM|3.0|While it was very exciting to see Star Trek made into a movie, the results were less than stellar.  The movie was plodding and way too long.  If the movie had been edited down to 90 minutes, it would have been more enjoyable.  The plot was decent but way too drawn out.  The second Star Trek movie (Wrath of Khan) blows away this movie.  Skip the first Star Trek movie and jump in on the second.  I am a Trekker, but cannot recommend the first movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this as an alarm clock. It has lots of options....well lots considering its free. Has worked perfectly for me as an alarm clock.
B00005R23S|5.0|WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN A CONCERT IN SPRNGSTEEN'S HOME TERRITORY?  As always, the NYC crowd is very animated and responsive pushing the concert's energy even higher...what could be better than that??
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is one of my favorite games! It was free and I think its one of my best games. I just can't believe it was free!
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Bruce Springsteen in concert in London...how could it be anything less than spectacular???  As I said before, these CDs were a gift to a Springsteen fan...she loved them.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This is an okay app. It was free but they don't give you very many puzzles. There are much better games out there for free!
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|One of the best Disney pictures ever made...It touches your heart and your funny bone. The racist crows, though shocking to our 21st century eyes,  are a realistic view of the times the film was made.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like this game. I'm not good at it yet but I'm still working on it. My kids play this and they do much better than I do.
B000E97X66|5.0|As I said before, all the Springsteen CDs were a christmas gift for my college roommate...As usual, she loved it!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Its a puzzle kind of game. Kind of basic...not alot of bells and whistles. Easy enough for kids. Not realchallenging or difficult.
B00S58LCB0|5.0|Gift for someone.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|A rebellious teen (Cyrus) is determined to make her father's summer misearble because he and her mother are divorced.  She has exceptional talent as a pianist and was taught by her father to love music.  Interaction with her co-star (Liam Hemsworth) leads to a  summer romance that is quickly blossoming into much more.  Just as it seems her life is making sense, her father collapses and is rushed to the hospital where she learns her father is actually dying.  She does the right thing and decided to stay with him until his death.  A split with her boyfriend leaves her sad and broken, but she will do nothing to mend the rift.  The totally expected happens....Dad dies, boyfriend returns and they make up and life goes on.  The chemistry between Cyrus and Hemsworth gives at least some depth to their characters, but only vaguely.  However, I did enjoy the move just because I believe in young love and the life lessons learned during those times.  Greg Kinnear gives a credible performance as the Dad and is a very mellow man, insuiating, at least to me, that he once was a very differnt kind of man, husband and father and perhaps Cyrus' rebellion is more understandable than first thought.  I would watch it again just fo the chemistry between Cyrus and Hemsworth....two very not young actors!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love, love, love the British and their satire!  So engaging!  The ups and downs of their lives keep us all wondering &#34;what's up next!&#34;
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love this app! Its so much better than the other free weather apps out there. o especially like the maps and storm tracked type stuff.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|Extremely well written with graffic descriptions. Characters interesting and varied. Kept reading well beyond my usual bedtime reading allowance. Book I shall read again &#34;down the line&#34;. Certainly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. After playing the original game I got this as soon as I first heard about it. I highly recommend this, however, it sometimes freezes, lags, or stops all together but it doesn't happen often. And this time they made the graphics so much better, if you have doubts about getting this believe me it is well worth it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I give this 4 stars. I like it because my family can have fun and just chill out. play it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like that it has a plethora of books to choose from.  However, I would like to see a flat monthly rate for unlimited childrens books.  Children's books are so short, and they go through so many that they should have a different payment system for them.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|,, Not Sparks best book,  would have liked more background on her,  did not captivate me as a typical Sparks book
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just wanted to know what was going to happen. Eva & Gideon were even better in this book. I truly enjoyed the storyline in the book. They were just as good together as they were apart. Cannot wait for the 3rd one to come out.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Could not put this book down. It may look long but don't let that scare you. This book can be read in a day or two. It is extremely hard to put down. I highly recommend it.
144235948X|5.0|I loved this book in the physical form and loved it just as much in the audio form, highly recommended!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Read title&hellip; It tells all&hellip; Love Minecraft though. I'm just saying random things now to fill minimum. There we go!
B001DPC52C|4.0|personally when its about of albums collections of bands i only count the studio albums becouse most of the live albums have audio problems, or singing problems that damage songs i use to love.<br /><br />in this very case its sort of an eception, i really liked this album, and if you already like within temptation this one should be in your collection too.<br /><br />give yourself the check some samples either the ones here on amazon, or anywhere you can check the tracks, for example give a shot to &#34;stand my ground&#34; or &#34;angels&#34;<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|temple run two is amazing but mines is always crashing and plus temple run two is so much easier not really a challenge but cool graphics
B006B5CR8Q|5.0|LOVE IT ALL THE WAY! NO WORDS CAN EXPRESS! TRULY AMAZING! AUDREY IS ONE OF A KIND AND IS VERY STUNNING!
B000B5XOSO|4.0|Michael Keaton reprises his role as Batman - the Tim Burton version - which is darker than any others since this Batman actually kills people.  Mr. Keaton is a very fine actor and while this Batman may not have been the best storyline, it was very entertaining.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I recommended this for my bookclub based on a KQED show about the best books in the San Francisco listening audience for 2012.  I loved the premise..sci-fi/fantasy crossing the digital world of Silicon Valley but the ending left me unsatisfied
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson make this movie more than worthwhile to watch.  You get to see two wonderful actors take on the classic good and evil of Batman and The Joker.  Although, Tim Burton's Batman is not that much different than The Joker, insofar as them both being tormented individuals and both capable of murder.  Great movie, in my opinion, and a great ending.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I played Solitaire on the 5 hour flight to Hawaii and it helped pass the time.  I like the way it automatically sends the cards at the finish and congratulates me.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|These are some classic movies that now look amazing in hi def now all brought together in this very cool  box set and now very inexpensive. I saw it in best buy for $50.00 , I got it here for half that an awesome deal !!!!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Jack Reacher never stops, never backs down. You don't want this guy to not like you. You definitely want this guy on your side.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|In the same way I look at an accident as I'm driving by...morbid curiosity. I was hoping this would occupy the same space in my  head as the Fifty Shades series, but it's not quite the same level. This does feel like gratuitous sex.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|With e exception of the Jo character, everything else was pretty easy to predict. There was good suspense in the recant of Erin's escape, but since it was after we already know she succeeded, how much suspense could there really be?<br /><br />In short, it's basically a rip-off of Sleeping With the Enemy.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Having lived on one of the Hawaiian islands for nearly four years, I could relate to many of the moments in this wonderful film. It seems there will always be trouble in paradise and this movie handles the issues with maturity and humor, leaving us both open to hope and feeling desperate for humanity to change its ways. The soundtrack of a long list of classic Hawaiian music makes the film even better, in fact, nearly perfect. And George Clooney makes the best performance of his career since The Perfect Storm. The suppporting actors are perfect in their performances to be sure. Thank you for this faithful work from terrific novel to film.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Somewhat of a page turner. Who is manipulating whom and what is left of the main protagonists after all the drama and manipulation?
B00422LESO|4.0|It was fun lighting reading that Jane Austen reader would love. Amazon wants me to add more words. It is for the female read.
B0011AQLZQ|5.0|Enjoyed it very much! Beautifully filmed, loved the characters and acting. So true to the book, I am looking forward to watching it again some day!
B0063GORYU|5.0|We were given a Kindle fire for a present as we travel a lot.  I enjoy watching movies and keeping abreast of the news online but also need some alone down time.  I enjoy card games and the Spider card game was a good fit for our life style.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another GREAT book by Vince Flynn.  Fast moving action, and hard to put down after you start reading.  Can't wait until the next book comes out.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great product for RVer's who travel.  You can look ahead to see what the weather forecast is for areas you are planning to visit.  It can help you choose which places to go.  If the weather is not pleasant where you are traveling you can change your mind and head some place else.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is hilarious and I absolutely love it. It has the perfect mix of humor dance and song. I have watched it multiple times since purchasing.
B0000027RL|5.0|A Pearl Jam classic!  Love their music and this is filled with a number of great songs! I could listen to it continuously!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Follow the directions in the box, and you should have no problems!<br /><br />I used a slightly different method. After scoring the glass, I used a tempering method to complete the fracturing process. I alternated pouring a small continuous stream of boiling-hot water over the score followed by cold tap water. The stress from the temperature difference created a smooth cut and resulted in less sanding.<br /><br />I would also recommend buying a pair of glass tile nippers either from Amazon or a local home improvement store, and purchase more sand paper as there is only a couple pieces of each in the kit.<br /><br />I also recommends doing the sanding in a well ventilated area, and to wear a safety mask to keep you from inhaling the glass particles; they can be hazardous to the lining of your lungs.<br /><br />Happy glass cutting!!!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|See my review on &#34;War Is A Racket&#34; by Smedley Butler. Read these two books simultaneously along with &#34;The Plot To Seize The White House-The Shocking True Story Of The Conspiracy To Overthrow FDR&#34; by Jules Archer.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|I would have given sleepwalkers journey 3 stars as it's a knock off of some very familiar games. It's been done before if you know what I mean BUT the graphics are so darn cute I give this one four stars. The boards are challenging enough yet it lacks the ability to keep you addicted. Cute, cute cute.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this for my wife. This was her Christmas gift and she real loves it and the color was great too.
B008OOYALE|3.0|A friend of mine recommended this app as I was already playing Little Monster's (which I adore). This is basically the same concept but because I'm addicted to Little Monster's I find it hard to enjoy this app as much. Had I gotten this one first I'm sure my five stars would have been placed here ;) I gotta stay faithful to my monsters!! Teehee!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game but wish that I can win more. So that I can receive more credits each day.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have a hard time connecting with books sometimes but this was one of those addictive books that you just can't put down!  It was such a lovely read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I'm absolutely floored by the emotional roller coaster I was on for the last twenty-four hours. It has literally been that long since I started the book. Sky and Holder's story started out intense and kept up the intensity throughout. Whenever I thought there would be a moment to breathe, something else happened. I cried several times after finding out what happened to Sky, even when I figured it out so early in the book. My heart broke for both of them, for all of them who went through that.<br /><br />Oh, and let me just add.... BEST. FIRST KISS. EVER! OMG!! That first kiss was the best I've ever read.<br /><br />The way Colleen Hoover writes is exactly the way Holder acts... intense. She keeps you gripped to the edge of the page, turning frantically, your eyes taking in every word faster than your brain can process what's happening in front of you. Everything was so vivid, so amazing, even the horrific parts kept me gasping and needing to know more, to find out what happened next. I definitely see why this is a NYT Bestseller and stayed #1 for so many weeks. This is a book you DEFINITELY don't want to miss!
0802473156|5.0|This book is an excellent read. It really helps you understand yourself, your partner and what language you each speak and why.
B007N8RULO|4.0|enjoyable.  good for end of the day relaxation. love that it was free. take it with me on my kindle fire when I travel.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Love the Spartacus series!  Can't wait for the next one to come out!  Even with the actor change in season 2, hubby and I still watch the episodes back to back!
B009186JYI|5.0|Loved the old footage!  My favorite bit was the scene where Keith and Mick are just singing around a piano<br />doing &#34;Elvis&#34;.  Must have for Stones Fans!!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I looked forward to reading this novel when it was suggested for my book club.  The author has had amazing success with her young adult books and is an experienced writer.  The reviews were excellent that I had read.  So I thought I was in for a wonderful read.  I was mistaken.  Do not waste your time on this book.  It was extremely depressing with so many characters that it takes over half the book to understand who they all are much less keep track of how they pertain to the story line.<br /><br />The book jacket and the reviews were so misleading that I thought I was going to read a book about a community of interesting characters.  Instead, I was bored, depressed, and sickened by them.  I expected more from this author.  Do not waste your time or money, worst $38 I have ever spent on a book.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book was alright.  It wasn't amazing but wasn't terrible.  It had an awkward pace that was hard to keep up with but again, it's not a terrible book.  I probably wouldn't recommend it to friends.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|This, although fictionalized, is an interesting look into the world of CIA agents. Based on Valeria Plame and her &#34;outing&#34; by Cheney's goon, it shows consequences both personal and international of &#34;outing&#34; an undercover operative.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I finished this book in less than two days. If you want to laugh, cry, or just reminisce about young love, this is definitely the book for you. You will not be disappointed!
B005KR6NS6|5.0|This is a story written, acted and directed by one person. I learned about the difficulty of the Tango and the beauty of it. The varied settings and countries are wonderful. This is a gem that will  please dance people, those who like change in settings and changes of countries and beautiful music. The music with some by YoYo Ma is something to listen to many times.
B005LAII8K|2.0|Looper is one huge mess of a movie that seems to be under the impression that its unique concept can compensate for its numerous flaws and plotholes.  That's unfortunate because I was truly hoping that this film would be the next Memento; a groundbreaking and mindbending blend of entertainment and art.  Looper doesn't even come close.<br /><br />Rian Johnson's much buzzed about screenplay is set in the year 2044 where a group of hitmen known as Loopers carry out executions against targets sent to them from crime bosses from the future, thirty years in the future to be exact, when time travel has been invented but is illegal and utilized almost exclusively by crime organizations as a means to tie up loose ends.  One of the Loopers named Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is placed in an unusual predicament when one of his targets is his future self (Bruce Willis) who has been sent back to be killed in order to \\"close the loop\\".  Confused yet?  Essentially when a looper's services are no longer needed, his future self is sent back in time for execution since the mob wants to make sure that he never rats them out somewhere down the line.<br /><br />That concept requires the willing suspension of disbelief from viewers, but the real problem isn't with how absurd the whole thing is.  No, the problem is with the execution.  The movie never seems to flow coherently and feels flung together haphazardly.  Perhaps things would have turned out better if Johnson had let someone else have the director's chair.  His screenplay is brimming with ideas, but he doesn't do a very good job of bringing his vision to the screen.<br /><br />The performances are poor as well.  Gordon-Levitt's likability and charm are buried beneath the ridiculous prosthetics that he wears in order to resemble a young Bruce Willis.  He spends the entire film mumbling his lines in his best attempt to sound jaded and world-weary.  Willis, who is almost always a reliable action hero, doesn't have much to work with here and his character is one dimensional and bland.  Only Jeff Daniels as a mob boss sent from the future to manage the loopers approaches the material with the kind of \\"let's not take things quite so seriously\\" attitude that seems more fitting.<br /><br />It's too bad that Looper fails so mightily since its premise is ripe for a great movie.  This just isn't that movie.  It would have been better served by a different cast, a different director and a different tone.  In short, an entirely different movie.re and his character is one dimensional and bland.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book.  Couldn't put it down because I wanted to know what was going to happen.  Recommend it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|As a writer of Science Fiction, I am always interested in how other authors and directors create a story line that we, the reader or viewer can accept as what I call &#34;plausible reality&#34;. Stephan Spielberg has succeeded wildly in this series. When I watch these episodes, I believe, at least for a short while that the skies are falling. Watch one episode and I guarantee you'll watch all of them.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|He is obviously a very bright individual ,and good at communication. He experienced  what he wrote and it was interesting to hear his analysis of what he experianced.  I think I have to see this as more fantasy.  I've read Randy Alcorns book &#34;Heaven&#34;. This is the book I would recommend , not Proof of Heaven!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very interesting story.  I never guessed the entire time how it would end.  I like the cute games played between the characters.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I bought this for my dad for his birthday being a Dire Straits fan, but I have to admit that I'm a fan as well.  Excellent for any classic rock fan.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I felt the book was good not great. It started out making me confused. I felt like i was missing a book. Afterwards he would go back & explained what had transpired. I always felt lost.
B009YU9J0E|5.0|I love this album and I love this band.  I've loved all of the albums this band has produced so far.  This third album is a bit different and less harsh and less aggressive in nature than the first two albums, the harshness not being a bad thing, but it's nice to know that in addition to funky, weird, electronic, Atari-like sounds, they can produce really beautiful, moving, airy sounds as well.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As always, this series and Amazon's service are and were fantastic.  I might say that I was sad to lose two special characters (and actors) from the series, but am interested to see what next develops.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Still have a little trouble in seeing anyone wanting pain in something that's meant to be pleasure and are they rabbits?<br />Oh well it was still fun to learn something new for the bedroom, not that most people would do alot of the stuff.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I hate that stores charge so much for the 3D format.  Best Buy doesn't even have some of the titles.  Thanks Amazon!  Anyway, if you don't like sci fi leave this on the shelf.  For those who are fans of Alien franchise, you will love it.  If you are just into Sci fi, you very well might like the film.  The extras are nice and the outtakes are enjoyable.  This version has lots of extras and the movie on my family's new 3D screen is breathtaking.<br />Oh and for about $20?  Perfect.  Now the other 3D movies just need to come down in price.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I kept hearing about this book so I decided to purchased it for my Kindle reader. I really enjoyed the book good read.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Had rented the move and wanted to own it o watch many times. Cute story. Can watch it over again
B00AFROVQC|2.0|There were some good aspects of the book, but overall it was not believable and I am putting this into my \\"do no re-read\\" category.<br /><br />The good:<br />* Interesting world<br />* Easy to read, fast paced<br />* Introduced items which would be explained in future books<br /><br />The bad items far outweighed the good:<br />* Absolutely unbelievable- everything is magically handed to Thor and people take to him in unbelievable ways.  He makes instant friends with royalty, he falls instantly in love with a princess who instantly loves him back, etc.  He is poor and his father is a shepherd who somehow has the resources to have three sons who only practice fighting and they do no farm chores.  The shepherd father somehow has the ability to teach sword fighting to his favorite sons, while Thor is left to do all of the work.  Somehow he knows how to ride horses, despite being a poor sheep farmer.  He is given a magical falcon.  The list goes on and on- all of this and more happened in about a week's time in the book.<br />* Word usage- there are a number of times when the wrong word is used in the book such as the word \\"would\\" instead of \\"wood\\".  I found the editing to be disappointing.<br /><br />I would not recommend reading this book.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|No problem with the quality of the movie, which has happened before when buying/renting  movies on Amazon. We enjoyed it.
B000I186FW|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was very convenient on the fifth of November and my roommate really enjoyed it as well.
076790592X|5.0|I read this book because it was required reading for a student. I also suggested to other avid readers.  I recommend that this book be required reading for all students.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This product is grandson approved. The pictorial heroes enrich his imaginative play. It is much more than a storage or carrying case. So far (month) the zippers are holding up. We watched him open the package and play with it. The shouts of joy and squeals of discovery kept adult conversation from happening during a computer generated live transmission. This was a find.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great family movie. My kids really enjoyed it. We went all over town to find it and was always sold out.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is entertaining and I love it. I play it a lot so it is addicting and slighting time consuming. the only downside is it takes a lot of memory to download.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great story... Stunts were AMAZING... I recommend this to anyone that loves action. I think that Daniel Craig is the absolute best James Bond
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting from this purchase, but I was very impressed by the movie. I know nothing of surfing only from other movies that I have seen, but this one takes you into the other aspects of surfing not just catching waves, but the physical and emotional that goes into training for the largest of waves. Love Gerard Butler in just about anything and was impressed with the main guy Jonny Weston. and also keep in mind that movie is based on a real 15 year old kid. I thought it was inspirational and made me want to go surfing! LOL Definitely recommend.
B000LB7G00|4.0|I use this with SolidWorks at my job.  It is easy to set up and use.  It also works with a number of other programs
B00006LLLN|5.0|Love Allison Krauss & Union Station, a great blend of bluegrass and contemporary country music, absolutely can't get enough of it.
B00846REIS|5.0|When I wasn't reading about Gideon and Eva, I found myself thinking about they might be doing, where they were going and what was going to happen next.
B005COO1X6|3.0|This was a good short scary novel  I liked the fact that Stephen King keeps you on the edge.  Great!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Every night the kids beg to read more of the Martian. Stayed up a little too late on some school nights with this one. Ive been reading out loud so as not to subject them (and me) to the language. Almost a deal breaker. Would wholly recommend if not for the need to edit the unnecessary bad language.<br /><br />A shame that the book is so intriguing, yet my review has to warn about language.<br /><br />Note to author or editor: could you change a few words and make this a family friendly book?
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I look forward to the next in the series. Surprised but pleased at how closely the tv show stuck to the book in every way
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is fun for all ages! I love it.  It has everything you would do with a real horse, in a game.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm very good @ puzzles, so when this showed up on my phone as a suggested app, i immediately downloaded it on my Kindle Fire. Not only are there tons of pre-loaded pictures, there are 1,000 off free 1's you can download, along with 1,000 off 1's that you can pay for. The interface is good, although sometimes it is hard 2 scroll through the pieces. The graphics are VERY good &amp; sharp. The only feature not included is the ability to upload my own pictures 2 do as a puzzle. They also have like 5 different amount of pieces u can choose from, very easy to very hard.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Likely to replay again. Most likely to be called a solitaire hipster. Least likely to succeed at anything other than being called a solitaire hipster
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow. Cliffhanger. But it makes you want to read more. Best sequel I ever read. Ever. Ever. Ever. Must read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's amazing love story wish there would be a picture of who they looked like. I love how they fall in love. Wish there would be more than three books to this loving caring story.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I DIDN'T DISLIKE ANYTHING, I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. I COULD WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I WOULD TELL EVERYONE TO WATCH IT. MOST OF MY FAMILY WATCHES IT, IT IS THE BOMB.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is AMAZINGLY AWESOME!!!! I love it so much... I dint want to take it off my kindle! I love it!!!!!
B0049VZ222|5.0|I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WALKING DEAD PART I. IT IS AWESOME.  THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT 5 STAR'S. THE BEST
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|I haven't watched it yet, but an HBO Blu-Ray set for $32 was too good to pass up, at least for me. I've seen the first season and really enjoyed it, so I'm expecting no less from this one.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book has so many unexpected twists and turns that you don't expect and at times, their are parts where you jump, I never wanted to put this book down.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|It was about $18, which is half of what I paid for the standard def collection about two years ago. I really couldn't resist this deal. I'm not going to make that pun. You know what it is. Overall, great deal for some great movies (well, two of them anyway).
B008VBYN80|4.0|The game is fun and is time consuming....although wish I could could get clash of clans for kindle but this will suffice.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I'm not going to say much about the show, because it should be clear that it's awesome. The deal, however, was incredible. Not only did I receive it on its release day, but I received it for about $20 less than the store price set. Great deal.
0316228532|1.0|Why would the much loved and respected author of Harry Potter punish her readers with a more that painful venture into a world so ugly. Is it possible to give less that one star? I finished this novel because I too finish what I start. Could there be one bright light in the small  petty villages she wrote about? Even the ending was predictable. She has acted ruthlessly with our emotions. I have warned other Harry Potter fans to stay clear. Are there recovery groups for fellow readers?
B00A8ECU24|5.0|like the mini games their fun and easy after a while I meanits easy and the pony's are cute the way they are in the game!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  I wasn't sure if I would like this book because I haven't had much luck with the books that have been recommended to me lately but I did!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|this tool is great must have for any survivalist, it is a light, small unobtrusive unit that u can put away & not even feel is there.
B00171AN8K|5.0|One of my favorite of the various DKM albums. It is a must have for anyone who is even remotely interested in one of the best Irish/Celtic/Punk bands around!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works very well.<br />The maps and temp seem very accurate.<br />I am grateful it is available as a reference.<br />I also like to be able to shrink the maps.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing this video for a week and am already seeing improvements.  One thing I like a lot is that it is challenging but doesn't make me *so* sore that I don't want to do it the next day.  The point is to do it daily.  I think it is a good use of my time, which is limited.  I tried the problem areas video on Netflix and found it to be a little annoying (a lot of talking about not stopping, and quickly transitioning to keep heart rate up when in actuality the activity in the video has stopped).  This one is better.  I will try more.
0316069906|5.0|After hearing an interview with author on the radio I thought it would be good to read this book. As a devout &#34;meat eater&#34; I was not really concerned that the content would turn me off. The book is well written and gives a great insight into the factory farming business. No problem enjoying a steak after reading.
B008C2GVUG|3.0|As a remastered Version, the quality of the video is not as good as I imagine.<br />Better quality than DVD, but there is still a big difference when compare with Blu-ray nowaday.
B0076DELIG|5.0|just finished the black box and all I can say that it is an another great page turner.  Hopefully he will release a couple more bousch before ending the run on a great chracter that I have enjoyed for many yrs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am totally addicted to this lovely story. Please make Downton forever, or at least till Carson falls in love.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Very original story. Can't wait to find out what is going on in the rest of this new world.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Unlike other adaptations of the Holmes stories, Elementary keeps the core elements--the flaws and foibles of the main characters, and their relationship with each other and the world, while moving the scene and the stories to modern New York.  Our hero is still an Englishman, working with the NYPD to solve cases. Watson is now female (the lovely Lucy Liu) a former surgeon now working as a live-in drug councilor.  For the avowed Sherlock Holmes fan (I am one), there are enough references and similarities to the original stories to give a sense of connectedness.  At the same time the stories are new and the procedures are updated so that viewers unacquainted with Holmes and Watson will not feel as if they are missing part of the story
B006MW3UZW|5.0|very addicting show. could not stop watching. wish i hadn't put off watching it. its a definite must see if you like period shows
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|We were excited about Denzel as an actor and the inferred theme of the movie but found although acting was good and action scene of the crash riveting, the tale digressed to a celebration of an individual addicted to drugs and alcohol and how his friends and union tried to cover it up. Liked it but wouldn't watch again.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This is a little bit slower moving movie then the others, but anyone who has read the books will know that. My preteen loves these movies, but my 10 year old still finds them a bit scary.
1423140605|5.0|Mark of Athena was EPIC. I've waited for three months since the release for the book to come in my country and I decided to just buy it online and I must say I am not disappointed :)
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|We all know by now about the left out song, but I still really enjoy this cd. I like having the music from the show to listen to.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The video content is great. However the streaming from Amazon to my Sony TV has been interrupted repeatedly with internet connectivity problems. Do not experience similar problems with Netflix.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|We enjoyed it.  The acting was great!  But we didn't think it lived up to all the riveting reviews it got.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|My first comment has to be \\"TURN ON A DARNED LIGHT!\\"  It was so dark, not just for me as a viewer, but for the character I was annoyed that he couldn't figure out how to use a light switch once in a while.  The concept of the movie was good, but overall, I was disappointed with the content.  The back story on the demon was muddled and boring.  I just really felt, if the dialogue was better and the actions of the characters were a little more fleshed out, it could have been a much better movie.
B003DTLUFO|5.0|I got this for my birthday from my parents and I loveeee loveeeeee loveeeeeeee it. Great condition and reasonable price too. :)
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Very good! it's really thing! I needed it.<br />It lived up to my expectations. Very, very useful thing, if you have limited space.
B007SGM084|3.0|This is a sort of mixture of erotica and thrill. More appropriate for teens. Some repetition. Happy ending. Have a good reference of music
B006BDHAX0|2.0|There are only four levels. When you are done with them, that is it. I have reached three stars on every game. Now there is nothing else to do. Needs more levels.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars, but I felt some portions were just unnecessary. I was also not hugely fond of the ending.
0810983915|5.0|My daughter loves this series.  I recieved it in great time, and was able to give this to her for her birthday.
1936608898|5.0|After a recommendation from my doctor, due to a number of weird things going on with the workings of my body, I made the Whole30 change and it has been relatively easy. I'm in my 35th day and going to continue with the program for another 25 days. The changes are quite interesting and that's why I'm going to continue.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|I have never yet been disappointed with a ken follett novel, he is a totally brilliant storyteller, and I recommend this book to everyone
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this is the best book ever for kids it is funny and fun to read eay to do a report on this item love it.....
B00000G3PA|3.0|My son  liked it.  It made a good Christmas gift for him.<br />It was shipped on time and was in good shape.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is very fun. I love it. I play it all the time!!! I recommend it to all ages who like action games.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have a FB account and love to visit with my friends and family, share pictures and keep up on what is happening.  Sharing family photos of family and friends is the best part.
B0086700CM|1.0|This is a bad game the first one was boring and the second one was so amazing I couldn't stop playing it again last night my sister's and I all love it so I hope this helps and I hope you like the game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A couple of warnings first...be prepared to fall in love with this book. Second, have some tissues on hand...you're going to need them. Third, you really need to be ready because where this book takes you really isn't for the faint of heart. That being said, this book was absolutely fantastic. So emotional.<br /><br />This book has everything. After Sky and Holder quit fighting their feelings there is such a sweetness...a passion to their relationship. I can't tell you how many swoon worthy moments there are, I lost track!<br /><br />\\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss.<br />Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you,<br />then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br />[Holder to Sky]<br /><br />**Insert dreamy sigh here** I mean come on does it get any better than that? I swear I would gladly tell a guy I've never felt anything if he would respond the way Holder does. Book Boyfriend perfection!<br /><br />But sweetness and love and passion aren't the only things they have between them. There is so much playfulness and humor. I couldn't stop myself from laughing out loud at times. Her best friend Six is in a foreign exchange program and while she's away she's told Sky she's going to text motivational type messages and at one point Holder reads one and is like are you kidding me? So he decides, in order to avoid her getting a big ego, he's going to be Mister Anti-Positive Affirmation so you get things like this:<br /><br />Six:<br /><br />\\"Sky, you are beautiful.<br />You are possibly the most exquisite creature in the universe<br />and if anyone tells you otherwise, I'll cut a b***.\\"<br /><br />Holder:<br /><br />\\"You fell asleep right when she was about to find out her mother's secret.<br />How dare you. I'll be back tomorrow night so you can finish reading it to me.<br />And by the way, you have really bad breath and you snore way too loud.\\"<br /><br />Colleen Hoover definitely has a great sense of humor and it popped up through the book. Just enough to break up the seriousness and the tragedy that the book centers around. Like I said, prepare yourself for the worst because the closer these 2 get and the further they travel down the road of secrets they find the truth about the tragedies of their pasts and they are very heavy issues for a mature audience.<br /><br />But regardless of the heaviness of this book, it is A-MA-ZING. You really should read it. Go on! Do it!! You'll thank me later. :)t sense of humor and it popped up through the book.

0345803493|5.0|I am not a reader, but after I read the first book I couldn't wait to finish the trilogy of Fifty Shades.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a very challenging game and kept my interest until the end of the adventure.  Could have used more zoom as some articles were hidden in dark areas.  A older person will have trouble finding these objects.
B004APVI1G|5.0|The first really 3-D image is a feather flying straight out of the TV during the opening credits.  The imagery is beautiful and often  breathtaking.  My son loves to watch this movie over and over....
B004XWLN20|5.0|I got this for my fiance for Christmas and he is in love. I am offically the best fiance ever!
B00AIA89HS|5.0|I started listening to Hatebreed after seeing a video for \\"This Is Now.\\" Rise of Brutality totally blew me away. It captured the sentiment of being pissed off about something, and not wanting to say \\"screw it\\". Throwdown is the only band that I think comes close to matching their combination of intensity and a sense of voice. After I got Rise of Brutality, I went back and purchased Perseverance, which I think as a song and an album, perfectly captures them as a band with something to say about the world.<br /><br />With The Divinity of Purpose, they seem to have come full circle. Jasta started out with a message of \\"Strength through solitude\\" in Perseverance, and now shouts about the value of not always going it alone with Divinity.<br /><br />Musically and lyrically, Hatebreed at their best.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is adorable addictive (bronies would love this!) if you know what those are. get this Free app NOW!
B00BIZP7G8|5.0|I really like this show and am glad that someone finally gets it that people are sick of reality/talk shows. A lot of people that I know and are widely different in age groupings love this show.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie was a very close recap of the hostage crisis. The effort to reflect history was very good. Enjoyed the ending.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|Natashka Khan channels Kate Bush for most of the album and that's not a bad thing. The first 8 songs are nothing short of masterpieces. The last 3 have this 80s vibe that I'm not to into, but it points an electronic way forward.<br /><br />Highlights - \\"Lilies\\", \\"All Your Gold\\", \\"Laura\\", \\"Winter Fields\\", \\"The Haunted Man\\", \\"Marilyn\\".<br /><br />Also I suggest to go on Youtube and check out her live performances of these songs, they will make you appreciate them even more.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is the 3rd book if the Outlander series and it was a good read. Tons of things happen to Jamie & Claire that are almost too incredible to believe but Diana Gabaldon ties it all in together at the end.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|We first saw this on TV and after that, we wanted to watch it over and over. It's great for the family to watch.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|A real up close and personal view of this larger than life character. It's a bit weird seeing Apple products now having seen how much of his own persona Steve reflected in them.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have a greater appreciation for Apple products.  This book is well written and kept me wanting to read more.  Highly recommend.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Very short stories but doesn't miss out on the quirky and witty exchanges between Holmes and Watson. Could've had a bit more elaborate versions. Good collection of cases.
1565114205|1.0|Somehow I accidentally ordered the CD version (rather than book). Narration is really bad, so sadly, have to give this a bad review though I'm sure the content is great, just the audiobook was really unbearable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful book. This is the first one that I have read by Colleen Hoover and it was fantastic. She drew me in with her characters and made me love them. Very well written.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|This product will download on your Kindle but, in order to use it you have to download another product which is Not compatible with Kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Stayed awake all night watching one episode after the other; great characters,interesting relationships, and quite a few twists, turns, and surprises. Looking forward to Season 4.
044024367X|1.0|What a waste of time reading this book. What happenned to the great Jack Reacher stories?<br />Please tell me the next book will be better...
B009M1QRM8|5.0|This is yet another example of the skils to write pageturners with good kraftmanship. I will not give away any od the contents, just read this book and learn the enigmatic roads that are travelled in it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|love these kinds of games. keep them coming.<br />I like that you can zoom in and out. and the hints make it easy when you get stuck.
B000002QWD|5.0|His voice makes you stop and listen. Love White Christmas music! Great music for all ages. Great for parties, especially Christmas get togethers.
B00843TZJ2|1.0|I am 62 yrs old and have grown older loving CSN, I was a hippie in the late 60's early 70's and their music was just the best , they harmonized like no one I'd ever listened to next to James Taylor and Carol King......This CD was just horrible, it made me sad, growing older is difficult when you still hold on to things in the past that make you feel young...listening to this CD made me realize that we all grow old, I will continue to listen to all of their old music as I have them all but I passed up a chance to go to their concert here in Orlando , FL on May 5th after listening to this CD. :-(
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This group is very interesting. They are unique and their lyrics are perfectly in sync with their music. They are incredible.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is awesome. The puzzles are just hard enough to make you think. If they stump you the hints are great. plus the price was super affordable!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Yes I know it's a teen movie and a vampire movie and those are not always popular but I think this series is well made.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Im not much of a reader, but after long conversations about Halo and not being able to follow it, I figured I would try it. Within a few paragraphs I found myself on the edge of my seat trying to read faster than my eyes could follow it. The detail that is put into the story makes the imagination come back to life. I cant wait to get the whole series and read it on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.
B008476HBM|5.0|Sweetest love story. I love the back and forth between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, they were absolutely meant for each other!
B001C08RHA|4.0|We bought this primarily for our grandsons, and they love it.  I liked it better the first time I saw it.  After five or six times, it gets a little old!  Seriously, kids will definitely like it.
B000W965QW|5.0|I was just dumped, so I bought this book on my Kindle. I've read it before on paper, about every time I've been dumped (I'm a serial monogamist), but this way I can highlight and share all the witty sentences that Hornby never managed to replicate in any of his other books – this is the only Hornby book I like, but it's also one of the best books I know. It's still the best book to read for newly single and immature men with no direction in life. Especially if you read the first part of the book when you're freshly dumped, and then have a break and read the ending after a few weeks.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|Never caught my interest. Read about 30 pages and have up. Waste of money since it has been deleted from my library.
B002ZG976U|3.0|What a surprise, christina was beyond exception and Cher was her wonderful talented self. Enjoyed the movie with family and friends
B004JYP10C|4.0|Love this Album, I can understand each and every word clear as a bell.  No loud music to cover up lousy voice.
B0004Z33EQ|3.0|As I expected, thank you, one of Staloones better stories, good action.  Good movie for a cold and rainly day
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really cool game, realistic en I like all the horses in the game..  I need a black horse lol<br />it makes you feel like your out on the farm Mindanao day!
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|Have not read it yet. I had to rate to read, but it seems pretty good. We shall see i guess.
0792156684|3.0|While I did go see this movie when I was 13, and I did enjoy it, I only purchased the dvd to watch with the rifftrax. I did enjoy it.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|Very moving. Really gives you insight to a crazed time in Nikki Sixx's life. I really enjoyed his crazy story
0756655307|5.0|Growing up I was a huge X-men nerd. My wife and I decided to decorate with a comic theme in a bar/game room we were building instead of sports or wine like everyone else we know were doing. After putting up numerous comic cover replica posters aroudn the room, I stumbled upon this Marvel Encyclopedia. Read a few reviews and HAD to have it. This book is great and detailed about every character I could think of. Some get a 5 or 6 page spread like Spider Man and most of the Avengers. The only thing that could be negative with this book are things like, The Avengers 2 villain (Thanos) is very unknown and doesn't have much of a back story. He only has a small snippet of information on 1/4 of a page. This is fine now, but after A2 becomes a hit Thanos will surely rise greatly in popularity. Oh, also I brought this book to work with me and was asked &#34;How much did you pay for a book like that? around $80-100 I bet.&#34; Nope, says $40 on the inside cover and got it for $20 on Amazon with free Prime shipping.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow i love this book. I loved the whole hunger games series as well thank u suzane collins<br />Great book
B0017SWPXY|5.0|My name is Louie Armstrong Woodson.  I have trouble using the Kindle so Robert read this story to me.  At first Enzo and I didn't have much in common.  He meet Denny as a puppy, I was 3 years old when Robert rescued me from a very unhappy puppyhood.  Enzo chases the ball, I don't do that.  It was just Enzo and Denny at first and I came into a home with a woman and her two Elk Hounds.  Enzo had the house to himself when Denny went to work, I went to the shop with Robert every day.  And everyday we took our break walking Stewart Pond Wildlife area in West Eugene, Oregon.  Even with all that contact, it took two years before I fully trusted him and another year before I trusted any other man.  Most women were O.K.  The woman we lived with was a little huggy, kissy (Labs and Goldens are more her type) but she was very nice to me and I liked her dogs.  About then she was diagnosed with cancer and this is where our stories start really parallel.  We started spending lots of time at the hospital were I had to stay in the car during the surgeries.  During chemo, however, Robert would take me for walks in the park near the cancer center as the treatment took hours.  Then there was radiation and then it was over.  A short time later Robert and I moved to Westfir and we didn't see much of the woman and her dogs anymore.  A near death experience changes people I'm told.  Enzo started to fail early.  From chasing that stupid ball, I think.  Robert started having trouble reading this part of the book.  I will be 10 years old in June so he knows we only have a few more years left.  But the part about coming back as a human gives us some hope.  I am already a good Jazz signer and it can't be that hard picking up a horn.  So, in a few years, Robert will be looking for a young boy named Louie Armstrong with a knack for Jazz.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This cd is fabulous! Absolutely beautiful from beginning to end! I don't understand the bad reviews at all, except for the Elvis song. Other than that one song I highly recommend this cd. Get the deluxe edition for the extra songs.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I got this game from the free app of the day but it is WELL worth the .99 cents! My husband and I are having a war to see who can keep the fastest time! Great game!!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I gotta say, sometimes toys are just toys, but this bad boy is pretty awesome.  Get those batteries in there, and you have the lights and sounds of the sonic screwdriver from the 10th Doctor Who.<br /><br />The man-child in me is pretty dang happy!<br /><br />Bruce aka, Brusimm.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked this book although the ending was somewhat contrite.  As a parent it was penetrating, especially the devotion of the father to his son who he must have known had some problems.  Would recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|a page turner fron the beginning. Loved everything asbout it. Great story. You could just feel for Katie aka Erin, running from her abbusive husband. What she put up with til she finally found love. Saw the movie also and it was good but book was more detailed.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I liked this movie!  I would recommend it ! It hit home for  a lot of people. Lots of little surprises!
B00957T6X6|4.0|Great series. Great deal. I have no problems with it except that when flipping through the book their are noreal page numbers. His gets really tricky when trying to find your place if you have lost it. Also it gets hard to find it in the paper editions. All in all a great product.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Wow, this book really takes you back to a simpler time. I Could almost smell the bryle cream mixed with lucky strike cigarette smoke.  This book makes you think what if. Well played Stephen King well played.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Finally, a phone calculator I can actually see. Works awesome! It's nice to see a calculator cover the whole screen.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great site anyways and to have it on my kindle make its greater. It is eay to navigate and pin everything
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The cast of characters worked well together. They were easy to follow throughout the entire story without getting confused. I liked the blooming young romance between Jason and Piper. I can't wait to see how that turns out.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|You feel like you're in India, and you connect with the characters.  Judy Dench and Maggie Smith are great, as usual.
0307719774|4.0|This book will be wonderful for my grandchildren to look back on to be able to know what life was like in 2013-2018, and to know their grandmother better.  The questions are fun, and it only takes a few minutes of committment each day.  The only negative thing is that is it difficult to write in because it doesn't open flat and it's so small.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|thought id check this out as its free, and I've bee playing ever since.frantic hack n slash based game with good character progression for regular players. best online multiplayer on kindle!
B000GG4XJM|5.0|Matchless performance by Bruce and his wonderful band in concert - different but as good as Sergeant Pepper's and the Beetles
B008EKOO46|5.0|A book everyone should read and study because it tells us what we need to know about our- the world's- past and just maybe about today. It is amazing and so is Jared. Wonderful writer- loved his Guns, Germs, Steel as well. We all should know about the whys and wherefores of our planet.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My son absolutely loves this DVD and he got the box of book sets two years ago and we were so excited that there was a movie to go with this.  Our next purchase will be The Gruffalo's Child as we seen this over the holidays and are now on the look out for this.  This product arrived in perfect condition as described by the seller.  Will use them again and again without any hesitation.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really cool insight into how these world class operators train, think, and function. We are a fortunate country indeed to have such incredible men at our disposal. Great read!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I am not one that enjoys seeing nudity on screen but I really like watching true story based movies. The story line and the acting took over and you did not focus on the nude scenes. Really enjoyed the movie.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Well written and totally engrossing - well formed characters, interesting format - never saw the surprise ending coming.  This was a GREAT read!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|We downloaded this movie to our library because this is a movie you can watch several times over again.  Good for kids and teens and adults during travel.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|Great sound, great message and amazing voice! Mariah is as good as ever. The more I hear this song the more I like it. It just keeps getting better
B005WMQFOQ|5.0|Terrific job in capturing Barbie in Grace Kelly's role.................the outfit is beautiful, and beautifully made. I love mine. Great addition.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is great! I would totally and completely recommend this to a friend. you should play this app asap. Its a great way to pass the time!
B004LKRR6U|5.0|This is a stunning version of Grace Kelly in Barbie form........................the dress is a dream, it just floats....it really is perfectly done and I'm thrilled with it.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I love Taylor Swift and this is a great album. However, i gave it 4 stars merely due to the cost for a digital download. I have been told it cost 75 cents to reproduce a CD. A digital download costs them nothing. For $15 i should be getting a copy of the CD as well.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|the quality of this watch is amazing, my only negative is that if you don't wear the watch everyday you have to reset the time and date every time you put it on.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The end is  too predictable. I honestly saw nothing to like in either main character.Yet the premise kept me reading to see if I predicted the outcome correctly.
B00138EWJI|5.0|Probably my favorite album of all time. Carlos is my hero and embodies everything i aspire to become as a young guitarist
B005ZMUQCK|4.0|The movie is great and my kids love it.  I cannot recommend the digital download.  $15 and I cannot even put it on other devices.  I can't burn  it to dvd.<br />Amazojs inbox software must be installed and pay through it.  So for HTPC setups?  Your out of luck.  My opinion.  Get the DVD....and somewhere else.  Amazns price is ridiculous
B0012FHGCW|4.0|I remember the story on the news of this poor lad.  I have also read other books and articles by John Krakauer and enjoy his style of weaving an adventure. This one kept my attention and, although has a sad outcome it reminded me of reading Jack London and his story &#34;To Build A Fire&#34;.  I will watch this one again.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Somewhat entertaining. Not what I expected but fine. I recommend it for a change of pace. You might like it
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I hook my Kindle Fire HD to my TV and watch movies off my computers in my room.The only thing I don't like about this app is sometimes a movie will play the sound but no picture and other movies will have a picture and no sound. I think this may be the format of the movies. It also sometimes tells me I need to add some vitimo? plug-in but then won't let me. But all in all It's a very good player.I would even pay for this one.
B009GJCFL8|4.0|Top shelf Asia show. One of the best in terms of audio quality and a DVD of a superb performance.Good price!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this every day and it has never failed me. It does have a few flaws like once it set 75 alarms for 8:00 am and sometimes it will chime when the alarm is set for music, but all in all a great app!
0684847817|5.0|I was extremely impressed when I received this book today. The art is beautiful, the descriptions are very creative, and what little nudity there is, is very artfully done. I would recommend this book for any fairy-lover!! I am extraordinarily happy with this book and am very excited to add it to my ever-growing book collection!!
0307742997|5.0|Nesbo outdid himself with this book. The twists and turns never stop and I  didn't want to put it down. One of his best so far.
B008B68IV8|4.0|My daughter likes the way the doll looks and she also likes to collect the whole series of monster high Scaris
0307361012|5.0|I'm a Nesbo fanatic so it was great to finally read the original Harry Hole tale and it didn't disappoint.  This guy is just amazing. I hate to see each book end.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I have always loved his music, but this is a real loser. It has no beauty and no power. His music has been so beautiful and the lyrics have been so meaningful. This is a mess.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love being able to stream this on my TV whenever I want. The best part is making up for shows I have missed and not having to wait till the following week.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Time travel, alternate dimensions, new beginnings, I’m looking forward to the next installment Into The Darknes. Spock and Kirk are dead on. Luv Chekof and Scotty
B003O86FMW|5.0|If the new movie is half as good as the second book it will probly be better than the first movie..
B0076DELIG|1.0|The series is repeating an old story line .  The requirement  by Amazon of how many words to write is so offensive  I shall ignore<br />all future communications.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Protects the Kindle and makes a very useful stand for hands free reading.  The elastic came off and got lost somewhere on my recent trip.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This book has always inspired me since I was born...There is love stories,sad stories and best of all it's the Book to everlasting life...
B0096HID5M|4.0|Was hilarious! Loved Russell Brandt. The music was great, the only thing that i might add is i think they should have shown more of the stage show.
B00589AYWW|5.0|This story is an  education on  how the powerful make decisions about wars and sell  those ideas without honest and  complete rationale for  doing so.
B001JIDE3M|5.0|I love this movie. Action packed.  Watched it with my 7 year old.  We both loved it.  Highly recommend for a rainy day.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Only a few albums do I enjoy listening the entire way through - alt-J's An Awesome Wave is one of those albums.  I don't collect vinyls, but if I did, I'd purchase this in a vinyl as the entire straight listen is an amazing sonic journey.
B009HELT3C|4.0|This was pretty good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It kept up with the other MIB movies.  Definitely should see at least once.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Very interesting, but one needs some understanding of quantum physics, etc.  Very readable in spite of the depth of topic; liked the humor.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Once again, we love Ice Age.  This one did not let down. All the Ice Age Movies are great. Highly recommend.
1451695195|5.0|As I am always looking for truth in the spiritual realm, I was intrigued by this professional, agnostically-inclined man's story.  It has been life altering for me, and I am grateful to have found it.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Great story....takes you back a bit too the old Reacher. The twists and turns keep you guessing. It's fun to guess correctly, and more fun to guess incorrectly. A bit steamy for a Reacher novel, but nothing over the top, nothing raunchy.....and then there's the butt-kicking! ANOTHER MUST READ BY LEE CHILD
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Stays very true to the books and the atmosphere of the books as a whole.  Top notch quality from HBO here.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series.  Well written, well acted and the setting is beyond gorgeous!  Very worth the hours spent watching, and re-watching.
B003VW54QO|5.0|Basic morality story with an excellent cast of either big name stars or stars soon to be big name.  Angie Dickinson plays her role to perfection although you can tell Ricky Nelson is in a stretch role.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|While this version will never measure up to the PBS version, it is a nicely acted film and Donald Sutherland is wonderful as the father.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this version. It is simple, fun, has great card selections and backgrounds. It isn't impossible to beat yet it is challenging! I recommend it as a way to pass the time, wind down, or challenge your mind.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|As an archery coach, I was especially pleased with the accurate form used by Merida.  As a teacher, the film has excellent values and offers many options for group discussion.  As a viewer, I very much enjoyed just watching the film.
B0095P31L6|4.0|IT IS THE TYPE OF THE TYPE OF MOVIE THAT KIND OF GROWS ON YOU,AFTER YOU YOU BEGAN WATCHING YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IT IS GOING TO END, THE CHASE SCENE WAS TOO FUNNY, 'LOL'
B009VYF5E2|5.0|'Merlin' follows the life of a young warlock, the legendary Merlin, before he becomes the bearded advisor to King Arthur. Merlin, instead of being a wizened old man, begins the series as a happy, optimistic young man. The opening scene has this wide-eyed country boy entering Camelot, a place where he could be executed just for the simple reason of having magic. His first meeting with Prince Arthur is surprising and hilarious.  After saving Arthur's life, King Uther rewards Merlin by making him a manservant to Prince, and now King, Arthur. Colin Morgan's (Merlin) and Bradley James (Arthur) have a great chemistry together and are the sole reason that Merlin and Arthur have such an epic bromance. Merlin and Arthur's banter and rapport with each other is amazing and entertaining.<br /><br />The show kind of picks and chooses parts of the legends and pieces them together however the writers choose. Some Arhturian legend people probably think the show is blasphemous, but I think it is pure genius. Right away, the humor embedded in the show drew me in. I love sarcasm and banter. Then, this season, 'Merlin' began to show a depth it did not previously possess. The fourth season starts out strong, establishing Arthur as the ruler of Camelot, and after his father's surprising death in episode the three \\"The Wicked Day\\", as king. Each episode this season has more of a weight on it. You can feel how much work Merlin still has to do the create Albion and how Arthur feels like he won't live up to his father's reign. The show, I guess most reviewers are saying, has become more dark and mature.<br /><br />This season, like all shows, had its highs and lows for episode quality, but altogether, this show is amazing.My favorite episode is \\"A Servant of Two Masters,\\" Who knew that Merlin being cursed to become Arthur's assassain could be so hilarious? One episode that I did like, but I didn't think went with the story arc they had begun at the beginning of the season was the ninth episode, which is where Lancelot makes an appearance to help complete the Arthurian Love Triangle of Gwen, Arthur and Lancelot. I felt like they were only putting it in there for legends sake. If they were going to do that, they should have done it when Lancelot was still alive and done that story line justice. I wish they would have stayed more focused on Morgana's search for Emrys and Arthur's journey to accepting magic.<br /><br />Honestly, I mostly watch the show because I love the characters, and therefore, I have come to love the actors. Colin Morgan, Bradley James, Katie McGrath, and Angel Coulby simply shine this season, especially Colin and Bradley. They both have to pull off a lot of emotional scenes, which they nail, but they both also possess great comedic timing. All of there scenes together (and apart) are just wonderful. Gwen's charactor gets more involved with court politics this season, letting Angel really sink her teeth into the role, allowing her to show more dimension to Gwen's charactor.<br /><br />So, yes, simply put: Merlin is definitely worth watching...over and over again. Plus, with this box set, you get the amazing extras, which you can't get off of Netflix, so I think everyone should own the DVDs or Blurays.

B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I've never seen an animated translation of any comic or graphic novel as well done or as accurately done as this. This is amazing for Batman fans and fans of any good story. Just watch it.

B004SIP9VA|4.0|Good movie for all ages.  It has been a while since I watched it, but would<br />Recommend it to everyone
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I like watching Denzel and I did in this movie as well. Not the best film I have seen him in. I do not think his performance deserves an Oscar nod, although some of his earlier movies did deserve the nod.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book!  Could not put it down the whole time. I thought that it was the best book of the while series.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Can't go wrong buying this movie it was excellent.  Judi Dench was outstanding as she always is.<br />Saw this at movie theater first and liked it so well, decided to get my own copy.  Daniel Craig was<br />sooooooooooooo good.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|It was creative, imaginative, and very well done as for creative writing.<br />I was extremely impressed, for to keep one's interest totally throughout the novel is quite a feat.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This was such a good movie and historical.  Love Colin Firth, he is so good an actor.<br />I now own several of his movies.
B00364K6J2|5.0|Such a great movie. Jason is hilarious in this movie and Clooney is also hilarious. Great movie that can be watched by any age group and everyone will enjoy it! Great animation and a fun plot that is filled with funny comments.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|The premise is very interesting, and the main character is loveable. I would love to be at Mr. Penumbra's bookstore. However, the plot gets a bit bizarre.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love tr2 but find the kindle is a little big to hold and make the finger jestures on. otherwise a spectacular way to pass time. better graphics and more interesting obstacles now too.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|What in the world?  I attempted to watch this movie 3 times!  I figured I must have missed something being that there were so many 5 star reviews!  I found the characters annoying and the plot unbelievable.  Sorry, just didn't do it for me.  I was quite disappointed because I wasted so much time trying to get SOMETHING out of this movie...well that was like squeezing blood from a rock!
B007PTJOV0|2.0|Too many gliches and crashes. It was a good game. Knock off version of Super Mario. It's ok I guess.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|The original Silent Hill movie, with its blend of sadness and creepiness and Jodelle Ferland, was superior to this one, but this is still good enough to watch for more horrific images.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|My little brother begged me to download this so he could complete a quest. I personally don't like it at all.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|this book is one of the best sequels I have read in a long time. somehow the story's is kept fresh and exciting leaving you begging for more. everyone who read the first book knows this is a must read
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It's ok, after a while I got tired of it. It's a great way to kill some time when your bored.
0676973760|5.0|Much better than the movie, you really feel for Pi and what he went through.  If you liked the movie you'll love the book.  Easy read, hard to put down.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game. I love the series. This is number one on my list of favorite games on my kindle fire.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|Nice remake of the &#34;unofficial&#34; first film.  Over all good movie all the Bond goodness youd expect.  I personally like Craig's portrayal of Bond alot so i may be a bit biased.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I absolutely love the book so far! It's a great suspense builder. It is a great read! I love it.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|The worst 007 movie ever made. Plot only a simpleton could not follow, every scene you can predict before it happens, then you know the next 10 scenes. Very little action. Daniel Craig should not be allowed to show his face ever again.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is simple, easy, and way better than giving out your phone number all of the time. It is awesome.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie tells the story we can all relate to I think. Life is hard, many starts and stops, but love does indeed conquer all.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|\\"Looper\\" is perhaps better tackled in two halves: the action half, and the not-so-much-action half. During the action half, we're introduced to the concept of Loopers, druggy hitmen who are hired to off mob targets sent back in time. Loopers are eventually forced (for reasons never totally clear) to kill their own future selves, discovering a golden payday when they do. Then they've got 30 years to live it up. Predictably, the main character doesn't pull the trigger on himself when he's supposed to. Chases, violence, cool effects, nice score ... decent fare up until this point.<br /><br />Then the film drags us out to a farm, where the action grows as slow as the sugar cane in the fields. A seemingly throwaway line about telekinetic mutations comes into play. We meet a mom who simply doesn't invoke the warm fuzzies like the film intends, and a little kid who is about as charming as Damien in \\"The Omen.\\" There's an affair that feels forced. Then we have Bruce Willis back in the city, committing actions that cause us to lose all sympathy for the character. This film just begs you not to like anyone in it.<br /><br />Three stars for the concept and first-half execution. The rest is best forgotten.
1616550414|5.0|Its better that what you think it will be online, you have to buy this book if you are a LOZ fan.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|&#34;North by Northwest&#34; is a winner for all the right reasons: a fantastic score, an iconic crop duster scene, a snappy suit, and all the innuendo Hitchcock could muster. Yet it gets even better in HD. The colors are crisper; the details pop. Buy or rent the HD version and you will not be disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great suspenseful family challenges that anyone with a teenager can relate, I would highly recommend this novel. Very reasonably priced.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is great!! You get to cook and serve!! I liked diner dash and I LOVE this game! It runs very smooth on my Kindle
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I needed a new cable for my kindle.  Bought it online and in no time it arrived, so I didn't have to suffer without it.  Thanks for the promptness.  It's the little things for everyday life that keep us happy.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is written from a great perspective and I couldn't put it down.  I read it in 3 nights....
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I am hooked! Best show ever!!! Acting is realistic and story line never gets boring!mi just love it... My favorite!
B007TK77QE|3.0|bit hard to get into and nearly stopped reading it but prefered the Harry Potter series better! Will try another one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Spectacular scenery, architecture, horses, costumes, acting. The complete opposite of trashy movies out of Hollywood. Not even politically correct which is so refreshing.
B00BHATWFQ|3.0|The Series, is OK to spend some extra time! the Soft Porn is a mixture of sadism and masochism what ever happened to just good old fashion sex?<br /><br />I do enjoy that the show has a few great actors Peter Dinklage for one does a great Job.<br /><br />King Of Thrones is OK for Adults! The plot needs to be better and Sex is good but Sex is sex stop mixing it with Violence no reason too really.  Then let the Kings Wench with good looking wenches and the battle fields be bloody.<br /><br />IMHO
B0053O89WY|5.0|We have the whole collection. Big Bang is the funniest show on tv. We watch the prime town shows and the re runs. We've seen every episodes.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|When I heard there was a movie being made, I hurried and read the book.  I knew it had to be good if they were making it into a movie.  Best page turning book I have read in a long time.  I will be reading all of the books by this author.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is such an amazing author. This book had me laughing at times and in tears at others. A must read!!! Just amazing.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This book is excellent however I have two criticisms.  The amount of characters introduced in each chapter is almos impossible to keep track of.  I am also disappointed in the outcome of the members of the family of Eddard Stark.  Does anyone survive?
B001QWBM62|5.0|I cannot emphasize how great this product is.  We use this recorder alone or with an additional mic to record meetings, classes, or events.  Everyone loves these Zooms, and I have to concur.  They are perfect for the prosumer market.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent, a book to share with others.  I enjoyed the presentation and his writing style, it is very believable.  With his medical background and his former belief system it is a book I really appreciated and believed.
1401307787|5.0|Fast shipping with a great price! What more can you ask for! A really enlightening book to be shared with all your friends and family.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This Jack Reacher book as good as the first. Excellent writing style, sometimes I have to skim through the lines because I can't wait to see what happens.  I will be reading the entire series.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Didn't take too long to complete but good fun nonetheless. I'd recommend if you want something quick and easy to play.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I think it is hard to comprehend at first but once you get later on everything makes much much more sense. Ender really shouldn't  have been treated the way he was early on, and sometimes even later on. Alai seemed to be his only real friend, besides Petra or Graff. His adventure is one that everyone should read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Now I have to wait a couple weeks to watch it! Bummer! Everyone's talking about Downton Abbey...I'm way behind.  Thanks for shipping it so quickly, it arrived just fine.
B00846REIS|5.0|Well written, engaging and totally captivating. Read it twice all ready. I cannot wait for the third book in June.
B003FBMS4W|2.0|The Searchers took no time at all to put me in search of the channel-changer. It was not even REMOTELY good.  Yes it was 1956 and, yes, those were the days... I get that, but you cannot be serious!!!<br /><br />Trying to watch this movie, after seeing any good movie these days, for instance 2007 No Country For Old Men, or 2010 True Grit, or even 1990 DWWolves...and you just can't!
B002N7W3NK|5.0|I have others music of hers so this DVD fit right in. here are eight more words words words words
B001V9LPYE|5.0|This was definitely not a kids movie as the rating suggests. I loved this movie and I have seen all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies thus far. The hard work that was put into this was evident in the animation and the voice actors (English and Japanese).<br /><br /> If you're looking for a lovey dovey chickflic or a movie to watch with the kids this is not one of them. I would suggest either Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro for that.
B00008HCCF|5.0|I have others music of hers so this DVD fit right in. here are eight more words words words words
0143115014|5.0|This is the indispensable guide for perfume lovers. When you go to buy a fragrance, take it with you. It is written with zest, with a charming prose, and impeccable judgement. I don't find the descriptions completely clear, but that would be to ask the impossible. We don't have a notation system for olfactory notes. Still I have<br />found this book immenesely useful, delightfuk to read, and indeed the indispensable guide.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read the novel in a very short time. It's written in a very interesting style and that creativity adds to the enjoyment of the book.
B007SPPANM|5.0|Have always loved this movie! Could watch it over & over & have so many times it about has driven my husband crazy!
B003R1B9MW|5.0|&#34;The Greatest Game Ever Played&#34; was by far one of the most inspirational movies I've watched in a long. Not sure how I missed it when it debuted in 2005 but so glad I took the opportunity to watch. Based on a true story - very good!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Great book it is. So simple to get all the riches, happines and all your desires can come true .
B005LAIHCM|1.0|By now, I'm sure anyone reading this is more than familiar with the plot, so let me tell you why you without a doubt  do NOT want to watch this,OK?<br /><br />It's important to understand that House at the End of the Street is not really a Jennifer Lawrence movie, at least not in the sense that it's the Jennifer Lawrence we know from X-Men: First Class and Hunger Games. Lawrence was shooting House when Winter's Bone -- the movie that merited her an Oscar nomination -- came out, so it's a movie she agreed to do before anyone even knew that she'd one day be a major movie star. She was basically the teenager from the \\"Bill Engval Show\\" at the time, and the only thing that prevented this movie from being released straight-to-DVD was the fact that Hunger Games made Lawrence a star in the interim. Otherwise, it would've been a movie with a poster likely to feature a forest setting, a large shot of Elizabeth Shue's head, and a small one in the corner of Billy from \\"Ally McBeal\\" (Gil Bellows), all designed with MS Paint with a pull quote from blurbist  Pete Hammond. House wasn't screened for critics; the supporting cast is largely unknown, and the movie has been sitting on the shelf long enough to grow mold.  So, you don't need a Ph.D. in Common Sense to know what to expect from the film.<br /><br />I've seen better DTV stuff from Lifetime than this one!<br /><br />To sum it up, if you could get this from your video store on two  for one day, and have it be your free rental, you still paid too much.
B004XISI4A|3.0|I enjoyed The first three books in the series of A Song of Ice and Fire thoroughly. The characters are incredible and George has really brought them to life, securing Ned Stark as the noblest hero, Arya as the girl we all want to rise...<br />But in A Dance with Dragons, I can see no end. Each chapter jumps to another character, and half the book has gone before we return again.<br />I can understand the need or want to include every detail, but unfortunately, personally, I found it tiresome.<br />However I would definitely recommend the book, and all in the series. I look forward to the next book, and be sorry to say goodbye to the characters when it is &#34;The End&#34;
145210655X|5.0|Both of my boys (and my husband too) LOVE this book!  We all laugh out loud every time we read it.  Clever idea!  Also, we really enjoy the attention to small details in the artwork.  I would highly recommend this for any Star Wars fan... especially fathers.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a delightful series and we enjoyed it very, very much. The characters are immediately loved and we watched every episode several times. It's a classic!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|The tale ends with a sweeping, all-encompassing view of humanity and, ultimately, the Universe itself. The ending was both prepared over the three books, weaving threads that seemed until then futile, and shocking as far as favorite characters are concerned. A masterful story-telling end to an epic tale.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I'm always a little disappointed when Reacher strolls off into the sunset, but then, of course, I can't wait until the next installment is published.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The growth and development of the characters continues in Season 2. This series is easily my favorite in years. Maggie Smith is great, but many others deliver great performances. I do not watch programs more than once, but may make an exception for Downton Abbey.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really enjoyed the earlier Grisham novels, The Firm, The Client, The Runaway Jury, The Summons.  But then he seemed to get a bit dull, like his imagination had lost its edge.  This book, however, is every bit as good a read as the early works.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I read The Affair after the Reacher movie came out. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the books since I couldn't stand Tom Cruise as the main character. Luckily, as soon I started reading, my vision of Reacher returned, and no permanent damage was done by Tom. The plot was interesting, with a return to Jack's army days.  I hope Lee Child continues to write about Reacher's army career adventures. And I fervently hope another actor is chosen for other Reacher movies.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was a lot of fun to read and I must admit that it did enhance my love life.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I would recommend this to all my friends. This case is pretty yet tough and it is easy to switch from portrait to landscape view. I have had it now for a few months and have not had any problems with it at all.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really liked the fact that a man of science believes in something that science itself cannot explain. This was a wonderful story!
B0037KMHRY|5.0|This soundtrack captures each score from the movie and enables you to relive each exciting moment.  While I am not an especially big fan of techno music, each piece brings you back to that exact moment within the movie.  The music ranges from vibrant and powerful \\"club music\\" to scores that are sweeping, epic, emotional, and inspirational.  If you are like me, then this soundtrack will become one of your favorities and it will have you longing for the sequel.
1401938906|5.0|I have read many books on creating the life of your dreams, but this one offers exercises to help you prove that your thoughts shape your world.<br /><br />While the concepts in her book may not be new, the principle of the Law of Attraction is not something the author of the Secret invented, either. However, Pam is able to bring this concept to life by showing you ways in which to utilize the material and demonstrate how this energy works.<br /><br />This would make a great book for a book study, Unity/New Thought study group, or for friends to work together to help each other enhance their personal growth.<br /><br />Thanks Pam! I will recommend this book to everyone I know.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|** No spoilers **<br /><br />This obviously picks up where the second book left off, and like books one and two it finishes with a cliff hanger, although I suspect those that are familiar with Archer's style will be able to guess exactly where it is going!<br /><br />Those that haven't read the first two books will be at a minor disadvantage, so I'd recommend reading those two if you plan to buy &#34;Best Kept Secret&#34;, however it is not a requirement.<br /><br />The first half of the book is very much a continuation of the first two books in the series, however at the halfway mark it changes tack significantly. It's not that the second half is poor - it's just a different style to the first two and a half books.<br /><br />&#34;Best Kept Secret&#34; moves the story on nicely and I'm looking forward to the next instalment.
034580404X|5.0|I gave this as a gift and it did not disappoint. She is now re-reading the trilogy.<br />I would recommend this to anyone just getting into reading books. Each chapter leaves you wanting more.
B005LAII12|5.0|I thought this movie was so great ! It just makes me smile... Ted is cute and the writer, producer was genus!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have played this both on my Kindle & iPhone.  It's awesome & mentally challenging, especially when you get to the bigger grids.
1455523550|5.0|I have read several N. Sparks books---but Safe Haven & The  Notebook are my favorite!!!  just saw the movie & it was great too!!!
B000063DS1|5.0|An expanded version of the iconic film?-who could ask for more. The inclusion of rehearsal material along with additional songs from the concert itself makes this well worth the cost. My original two disc compilation will now gather dust. The free download included with the four disc purchase (unfortunately) is the same two disc set which has been available since the original vinyl release in the late 1970's (which I also own). The music, production, and even the information booklet are all first-rate. The promised download is not the four disc set purchased and therefore disappoints.
B005LAIIA8|4.0|I like the movie, but it isn't the same as The Nightmare Before Christmas, or The Corpse Bride. I don't think you feel the connections in this movie as much as you do in Burton's other animated works...but I still recommend it, and think it is good for all ages.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|Violent, of course, like most anything now.  But the love and care of others was excellent!  So many lives saved at great sacrifice.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|The Weekend albulm is amazing.  It's very sensual and soultry.  It is a great cd to listen to for hanging out with that special someone.
0439023491|5.0|The book came in a nice hard back along with Mockingjay. I was thrilled and it arrived very quickly. The story its self I will give a 4 out of 5 just because the romance between all three teens did bug me a bit bu overall a very nice read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't\\"put it down. Can't wait  for the next book. Fantastic author keeps your interest from the first chapter to the last . Keep them coming..
B0018S6YO4|5.0|Favorite Favorite Favorite there is absolutely nothing about this CD that could disappoint you.<br />I am a bit shockd myself
B00942XS04|5.0|Great movie. Once again Pixar proves its originality even in a sequel. Its not just a great animated movie, its a great spy movie too. A favorite of all three of my boys (6,5, and 2) and its one I don't mind having to watch over and over!
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|I think Wes Anderson films are an acquired taste so this film is not for everyone, but I really like this film.  The cinematography is very similar to other Anderson films.  Many closeups, sets that are a cut away of an entire house, and somber but appealing color tones. The story is pretty outlandish yet works on many levels, with quirky characters and no one character or actor taking the limelight.  The kids, Sam and Suzy are very ordinary, but I liked that.  However, the first 'kiss' scene on the beach is smokin sexy!  Made me remember what is was like to be 16 again.<br /><br />If you have scene Royal Tannebaums and hated it, you probably will not like this movie.  If you are up for something different than the crap Hollywood has been coming out with, give this film a try.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love epics in the historical genre and have enjoyed Ken Follett's historical novels since I was given Pillars of the Earth. What a wonderful world I was introduced to, thanks to a very good friend!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game...except for the fact that it reset itself for no good reason! I had managed to get Tricky and was around 15,000 short of my goal for 90,000 coins in order to buy that Tiki character or whatever and BAM. it erased EVERYTHING!! AGH!!! so yeah. watch out for that when your playing -___-
141659521X|1.0|I'm afraid Vince Flynn is becoming John Grisham more interested in churning out piss poor books than keeping up with his past quality books.  If this continues I will no longer be a Vince Flynn fan.  I have read all of Vince Flynn's books and everyone of them is extremely well written with a very thrilling story line. But this book is a bust.  To be honest, I never even was able to finish it it was so disappointing and boring.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|A wonderful selection of songs by a terrific talent.<br />Phil Phillips' determination to persevere through American Idol, with his serious health problems,<br />was admirable in itself.  He's a superstar through and through! This album proves that.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Very pleased. The 8 core processor definitely raises the bar on computing. Just to think that in 2005-6 the dual core processor was the wave. The Intel-D (Dare I mention Intel in this review. Pardon me AMD) was state of the art technology. That was 8 years ago and dual core is no longer sufficient for my purposes. Unfortunately Windows XP Pro does not really unlock the potential of this processor. A person would need Windows 7 Ultimate or above (or Windows 7 Pro and above) to really use the power of this processor which really does not need to be overclocked, at least for my purposes.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought this album for the songs &#34;Carry On&#34; and &#34;We Are Young,&#34;<br />and am getting to like the others very much, the more I listen.<br />It's such great music, and so upbeat, done perfectly.<br />FUN has a new FAN!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Our new favourite Xmas CD! New twists on old favourites; great duets with other top vocalists. You'll love it too.
B00BIZOMCI|5.0|Modern Family has kept me watching ad addicted to each episode since day one. This one seemed to have a few more moments of chuckles than the last several weeks. I know the formula has to change to stay fresh but I like the silliness of the family antics.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Heavy!, Sharp!, locks in sheath! Tuff!...Need I say more. Just buy one now and you will see! .250 thick! Its like having a sharp club!!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I could not put this book down. From beginning to end. It opens your eyes into the world of Jack and how his life has been turned upside down.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I really enjoyed this one.  I would suggest reading &#34;Fever Dream&#34; first as it is a worthy preamble.  I bought several other novels authored by these two as a result of this read.  I'm a fan!
1616550414|5.0|I love Zelda. Period! It was one of the first series I ever played as a kid and has consistently brought me a sense of adventure and accomplishment. Ordering this book was a no brainer, since now I can relive some facts of the old games and even learn some new stuff that I never knew about! For example, learning about Loftwings' designs and differences. I just always thought they were an awesome giant bird I could jump and soar through the skies!<br /><br />Minute details aside, the inclusion of the timeline, neat artwork and the nifty comic in the back should satisfy any level of Zelda fan. I can't wait to read the entire book and revisit some of my favorite games!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Product was good and got it fast It was exactly like the picture and description. The experience was very easy and simple
B0030V0PEW|4.0|The author takes an interesting journey through the development of checklists in medicine, commercial aircraft flight, and building construction.  My thoughts about checklists before reading the book was that they needed to be comprehensive lists of tasks that are used to turn off your brain and make outcomes more consistent.  Dr. Gawande, though, leads us through the development of a World Health Organization checklist for reducing surgery complications.  At first, the developers try to make a comprehensive list of tasks, but in practice it is viewed as unwieldy and unusable.  We then learn that checklists are best used as points to synchronize communication and prompt for the most important and most often overlooked tasks.<br /><br />Read this book through to the end.  If you get half way and you think it is slowing and starting to repeat itself, keep going...there are more insights to be gained by reading through the whole book.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Product was good and got it fast It was exactly like the picture and description. The experience was very easy and simple
B00000DHTF|5.0|Awesome CD BOX! Every cd is a new journey through Springsteen artictic work. If You like Bruce songs, this box will blow You up!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This season is so well done, so well written, cast, and acted, that I have told my friends who have never watched SOA to start here. After going back and watching a few first season shows it really is clear just how well this show has matured. It does have some very violent scenes, and folks who have trouble with that might consider skipping past. The show creator has said he wanted to make a west coast Sopranos with bikers and he has. Only better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it's so addictive.The graphics are amazing.It is much better than the first temple run.I would love to see &#34;Temple Run The Movie&#34;.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This movie was very interesting but the ending does get very awkward.  At times it did feel like the movie was faked but how could you possible make up something this twisted?  If you enjoy Catfish The Show you will enjoy this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldnt put it down for even a second, jaw dropping and romantic. Definitely a recommended book for any age group.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|This has been my favorite album over the last couple months. It is a fantastic CD from beginning to end.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|my 5 year old is playing this as well as my 12 year old nephew and a few adults I know play also.<br />That says a lot for the game and how it holds a person's interest.  But like many games of this same type, you have to visit the game  daily to feed and play with your dragons, grow food, feed, evolve and breed them.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|In my humble opinion you can't beat anything by Jane Austin. I can watch the movies based on her books over and over. And Jeremy Northam is a hotty. LOL
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a terribly addictive, silly, and oddly FUN little game. I was determined not to like it because there is Angry Birds hype nearly everywhere, but it won me over and I play every time I sit down to watch TV. My only complaint is that, in the free version, the ad at the top sometimes interferes with gameplay. Otherwise, I recommend it for mindless fun. :)
B005S9EJ14|4.0|The cast was a talented mix. My hubby and I watched it without much talking and no pausing so it did hold our interest.Judi Dench is such a good actress and the rest of the actors are simply a pleasure to watch.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great show. great character development. interesting plot lines. Similar to 24 with female role. lots of great twists and turns.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|First time I had seen this movie.It was cute not the best ,but worth watching. Any movie with Diane Keaton is worth watching at least once.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|What's not to love about this classic movie. Mia Farrow nails the Daisy character like no one else I can imagine accomplishing. Ad Robert Redford, well, what is there to say. He is fabulous as always and a perfect Mr. Gatbsy.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This film is awesome, but I wish they used the previous actor for the Hulk. Also I thought that Robert Downey Jr. was great.
B00867GKIK|5.0|great quality! . . . . . . . . . .  . . item as described and arrive quickly.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The book was okay but it wasn't one of those books that you couldn't put down, It was one a book where I could read one day and not pick it back up for 2 or 3 days.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really like this show, got started with season 1 and had to buy 2&3 just to keep up with everything.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|It's a classic for good reason. Clever writing, great acting, touching scenes. Funny, yet doesn't seem like it's trying too hard for laughs unlike much of the poor, insipid screenplays out there.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Loved this book, made me laugh and cry! Couldn't put it down! Read it in a weekend. Wonderful cast of caracters
B0009RCPY8|5.0|The double dvd set arrived on time and in new condition.  The dvds played fine.  It was a fun film at the time and still enjoyable to watch today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've Officially Become Addicted To This Game. At First I Was All About Temple Run And Temple Run 2, But Now That I've Run Into This Game I Just Can't Stop. Plus The Fact That It Was Free On Kindle Fire. Its Worth The Time To Download. You'll Love It !
B000UZNRS2|4.0|Good keeps your interest thru out . It will never be mistaken for a masterpiece but it isn't intended to be.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a great cast and a great story that enfolds!  Love that each character's life moves forward in different and exciting ways.  Maggie Smith is fabulous with her infamous one-liners.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Lots of laughs.  Clever and occasionally insightful repartee on some of the little green men and other cultural absurdities.  A teenage guy movie.  Haven't been one for a long time, but enjoy visiting that land from time to time.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This is currently the 1st Jack Reacher novel chronalogicaly in the characters life. It starts out in the Army, and deals with an investigation he is conducting.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows out there! The characters draw you in and you're hooked right away. Male sure you set aside time for more than one episode at a time!
B005XN31LY|5.0|This is a very good series that incorporates many fairy tale chacters. Each week a new character shows up in the story.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I was truly amazed at what this young woman went through during her life. She wrote candidly and explicitly about her experiences during her captivity.  How she was able to survive what she did, raise two kids and teach them what she knew, what she was able to teach herself, and her ongoing recovery are truly amazing and inspiring. Thank you Jaycee for writing this. You are an inspiration to so many women and girls who have suffered such as you.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is one of the best games ever. I don't like it though because whenever I close the game, I can't get back on later so I have to uninstall it and get it again from the app store.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|I bought this book based on another recommendation written here. This book exceeded my expectations. I wish everyone in the free world could read this book...and everyone in the not-so-free world, too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever since I bought it  it is the best game buy it.<br />The update is awesome to get the full version
B009G8GRX6|5.0|It is not just a re-rash of the same sound, like the rest of the albums feel. It's nice to hear different rhythms and arrangements, not just different words.
0307744434|5.0|elaborate breath taken novel that has surprises from the beginning to the end! The author captures your imagination! I hope Tim Burton get the rights to make this into a movie!
B0064W639K|5.0|Any one who is looking for a solid Batman story would enjoy this. Does not rely on knowing the entire bat family history, so it would be a good way to jump in.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I have read all of ian rankins john rebus novels and was so happy he came out of retirement to solve another case. It seems he will be back and I am thrilled! No other police procedural series is as enthralling. Thank you mr.rankin for bringing back John!!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|visually stunning!! Youll enjoy watching this dvd over and over again... and youll be surprised everytime of the things you missed the first time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best one. I think you will love temple run 2. It's the same controls as the original one. It has THE BAST GRAPHICS OF ALL TEMPLE RUNS!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|In some ways it's a relief to know partisanship is nothing and that support and continued interest fuels longstanding connections and commitments. The personalities peek through and can be interesting. But in the end these guys stick it out for each other. Great perspective!
B00005JKG5|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all time will watch this movie over and over again dvd was in excellent condition
B007EECSFA|5.0|Was lead along the garden path good story was following along, then a real zinger at the end.GREAT READ enjoy

1455523550|5.0|Safe Haven was another spectacular book written by Nicholas Sparks.  Very good read and suspensful to the end.  Thanks a lot!
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I was looking to build a system that would allow me to full enjoy ALL my computing interests, from everyday emailing and word processing to the latest and greatest in simulation games and playing videos via iTunes on my computer monitor, especially flight simulations.  I wanted to get as much bang for my bucks as I could squeeze.  As you know when looking for a CPU you must keep things like the socket model in mind when looking to match it to a motherboard.  In my case I chose the ASUS Sabertooth X79 LGA 2011 Intel X79 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard, coupled with Kingston Technology HyperX 16 GB Kit (4x4 GB Modules) 16 Quad Channel Kit 1600 (PC3 12800) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM KHX1600C9D3K4/16GX.  This combination of items allowed me to fully maximize my performance capabilities needs without breaking the bank.  I could not be happier with this CPU's overall performance and reliability.  I strongly recommend you consider a high end cooling system to make sure that overheating does not become a disappointing problem leading to premature failures.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Now this is great party music, excellent sound, puts everyone in a great mood!  Nice addition to my collection. A1
B002M9WW30|5.0|If your a Rocky Balboa fan, then this is the video collector's item for you. I could go on and on about the great Rocky movies, but as a fan you already know all that. Enough said.
1609611543|5.0|Having heard about the book on a TV show I actually started the diet before the book could come from Amazon.  The premise was easy and enough info from the web filled in the blanks.  End Result?  I lost 30 lbs in a month ( I increased my activity while working in the yard - normally I'm writing while sitting behind the computer all day).  My arthritis practically disappeared and that feeling of a hard lump in the pit of my stomach went away.  I admit I &#34;TESTED&#34; what was happening one night by treating myself to an Italian dinner with the fresh made large yellow egg noodles.  WHAT A MISTAKE!  I suffered for a day and a half and my arthritus hurt for two days.  I am happy to stay Gluten Free and no longer crave the things i used to love, which mostly wheat items.  I think I have a new lifestyle.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Hold onto your hats and purses folks.  This movie is a non-stop drama that will keep your full attention.  The combination of action and character acting will appeal to everyone in your family.  The action and graphics are nothing short of GREAT, and the acting is equally riveting.  This acting performance by Danzel Washington is nothing short of superb !!!!!
B007SXB498|5.0|I choose this classic because of that fact and that I had not read it since I was in school, (don't ask).  It was wonderful, I could not put it down!  The romance, suspence, it was a great read.  I would recommend it to everyone, if you haven't read it in a long time do it again now you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Happy in Idaho.
B008MM9630|5.0|i wish we could just do stuff without energy  i mean i wish we could just play the game with out having to wait for energy
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was awesome and hard to put down.  Enjoyed it to the very last page.  Highly recommend to anyone.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Buy the BLU RAY version, better quality and you'll never see a mess up picture. But it's still an awesome movie!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent show.  You must watch it from the beginning to appreciate the whole story. I can't wait for the next season.
B000HEWEEE|1.0|Save your money this movie is a bore. There are much better movies out there about love...try Ghost or something with a better actor then the one note wonder Keanu Reeves.
B002ZG976U|4.0|got this for a friend for xmass was told it was great and she loves it the music is great
078322933X|2.0|If you are renting this movie to show to teens, don't forget there is a super sexy roller coaster scene. It's a good movie about phsycho teen dating, but there is definitley a sexy scene.
B009329ZF2|5.0|got this for my brother in law he said it was greatand that he really enjoyed it will be borrowing it soon
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I teach Child Dev and show this movie to my students. Even the most synical really enjoy the story of Temple. The movie has a good pace and a great message.
B00867GK26|5.0|got this for a friend for xmass he really enjoyed the whole collection said the quality of film with all the bright colors was just great
B005USZYDU|4.0|Tested this book with two middle schoolers with different tastes. Big success...including with a reluctant reader, to whom it was read aloud. Now we're on the third book in the series, and the reluctant reader can't put it down. Grateful! If I remember correctly, the ending was a cliffhanger, but it's still worth reading...and the third book returns to the story.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm sorry, but I do not appreciate so many profanities in a book; they are simply not necessary and further, contribute to the detriment of our culture.  Otherwise, the story was quite fascinating and enlightening in terms of the principal characters related to the killing of John Kennedy.  It put the reader right into the action as if you were part of the plot.  I am sure that the book took a great deal of research in order to develop the story and Stephen King was quite clever in spinning the story the way he did.
B0007TKNII|5.0|its a great movie, nothign special about this order but its a great movie. if you arent into musicals wouldnt recommend otherwise you'll like it
B007REV4YI|4.0|This was a good bond movie but by no means the best one in my Bond 50 case. Great action scenes I hate how they showed his parents name and they had the name Bond I was always a fan of the theory that each 007 takes on the alias James Bond to explain all the years and technology differences between the movies as well as the different actors.
006197806X|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, she loves it.  She finished it within 5 days.  All and all she is waiting for the next one coming out...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing and very addicting! Definitely better than the first one. Although, that one was a hit as well!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that I can read on any tablet as well as my computer. I started with and ipad and will never buy books from ibook again. You can only read them on an i product. an now that I have moved to a android products all my ibooks are lost.
0425220931|5.0|Very inspirational, spiritual and life changing! I did not expect what was written inside the covers of this book. It truly changed the way I look at and play music and life.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|This app is useless! Not intuitive at all. Cannot find share, picture file, etc. No help or instructions on how to use.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Pretty good info.  There are maps and maps in motion.  Just what I need to know where weather is and where it is going.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Android flash issue was not solved by getting this program.  Even though it makes these claims it didn't bring flash to the android world
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Unique topic; intense and good outcome; very entertaining; not your usual and predictable plot; I was mildly surpised by the ending
B007I8S1TY|5.0|It helped jump start my learning.  More information from other sources are still needed, but it helped with clear examples.
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|Not sure why everyone's talking about it.  Reminded me of a Monday night special...thought it would get interrupted by a Pillsbury ad at any time.
B000089RVX|5.0|The songs are what I expected.  I have been surprised at how much I listen to this CD.  I would recommend.
B000M2O6AQ|5.0|Read the book,,the move was just inspiring..we feel a big change is occuring ...James Redfield is us insight for this ongoing change.
B002TWWOHE|5.0|White Collar is a charming, lovely show. If you like excellent visuals, quick dialogue, clever plots, and unusually handsome people, this show is for you.<br /><br />Although it fails to bring a convincing overarching plot line, the episodes themselves do have intriguing mysteries, and the characters are likeable and interesting. It rarely becomes sad, skipping past the heavier, darker emotions in favor of light humor. But when it does tip towards the dramatic, the actors are more than able to pull it off.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game was great when we were on the plane.  It also is a easy game to pick up anywhere to pass time.  Simple but still challenging.
0156012197|5.0|This is my childhood book. I am glad I found an English version that is illustrated like my Portuguese version was.
0060254920|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my grandson. It's one of those books he will pass down to his children. We've read it so many times I believe I can recite the book!
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|Ive heard that some people dont like this movie, and i simply cannot understand why! Naomi Watts does a marvelous job as the lead actress, and Andy Sirkis as Kong breaks my heart. All in all the movie is well acted, well paced and incredibly beautiful. the cinematography is wonderful it looks like the early '30s and its just a brilliantly directed movie that came out amazing. If you havent seen it I would definitely recommend you do so it is a delight. It is very long so you might want to watch it on a day when you dont have too much to do. :)
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I don't know yet...I'm going to try it out tho so if its good I will rate it good!!! happy jurassic times!!!
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This was the first movie I ever watched in the United States. I remember being in awe. all of the songs were so beautiful , the scenery was gorgeous, and julie andrews was so likeable. I remember loving this movie the very first time i saw it at the age of 8 and years later its even better. Now being able to understand what was going on and how devestatingly quick their lives were changing. Its an incredible movie.
B00136JRZY|5.0|at the top of her career at this time. One hell of a voice with wide range, can sang sang sang.
B00123NXL2|4.0|I was introduced to Albert King through the album In Session with SRV. Love the music on this one, only docked it a star for the recording quality. Can't seem to get it loud enough to hear some parts well in my car. Not really a fault of the product but it is what it is.
B000VZUM5C|4.0|friend turned me on to this music, fell in love with jazz listening to this guy and some of his friends.
0399230033|5.0|This book instantly became my 10 month old daughter's favorite book from page one. As soon as she opened the book she laughed at the sneaky gorilla taking the zookeepers keys. The illustration is wonderful and easily understood by a child, even with out reading it. My daughter will turn the pages over and over, laughing and gasping at her favorite parts. Highly recommend this book!!!
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|Very absorbing and easy to read - the personal detail of &#34;normal&#34; people caught up in the maelstrom of the war highlights the horror of the conflict. This is by far the most riveting account of the war I have read
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great story.  It keeps the reader on edge.  Right George end.<br />I suggest this book to all of Connellys fans.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|First Class Production continues in Season 3.  The story line is rich and intriguing and acting superb!  Eagerly awaiting Season 4.

1601251556|5.0|Fold it against the existing folds to make it lay flat.<br />It has square's on both sides; who uses hexes that much?<br />Half the price of Chessex's mat, which is, admittedly, better material.<br />Big as a Chessex, Sharpie's wipe off with a little bit of water, and I'm glad I bought it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft on kindle fire is great.They are adding things to minecraft on kindle fire.I think you should play it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is an easy game.  Cute little puzzles.  Not too many free ones, but more can be purchased.  I like it.  Nice way to pass the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the most addictive kid game out there that I could find on my kindle.!!I totally love subway surfers but ppl say temple run is way better but it's technically the same.but I still love this game
B0060MYM7O|4.0|The Blu-rays were great as is the series.  But HBO needs to get its act together with the digital copy.  I have been trying for to days to download the digital copy as yet the site for this is not up.  It should have come with the digital copy not the useless ultraviolet download crap.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was an amazing ending to a great book series! Well, kinda, I am going to be reading the next series very soon!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Crazy mixed-up kids with adult feelings and an underlying very serious  theme of child molestation and suicide, very well done.

B009JBZH54|5.0|I waited to buy any of these untill the trilogy was completed. And now that they were finished I preordered and bought it. Best trilogy since the Original Star Wars, enough said!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow, so much happens in this book. Never thought I would put this great read down. I wanted to cry at parts and was so interested the whole time. I felt like I was able to follow the book until the end. I got confused but then caught back up!!! Over all good book.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was a wonderful book (the whole series was wonderful.) Lots fo twists & turns and enjoyable read for the whole family.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|The missions are stupid, not at all logical and pointless. The first version was much better. And the dialog in this version is too long
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Is it awful that I can spend hours on this game just trying to beat the level.  Very addicting. It allows me to zone  out for a while, and yet my kids can play it and it can challenge them too.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|after playing it a couple times it wouldn't open and now i cant play it.  befor that it was great
B005HSL626|4.0|I love that my kids can both play at the same time!  You can turn the sound off and it makes no difference to the game.  You can play it with our without bombs which makes it great for my kids and my husband. (yes he plays too! I do to if I get a minute.)
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Love it The Kids love it we watch this ,ove almost twice a month. story line is cool and fast pace.
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading this series since the first book came out in paperback and was not a best seller...YET.  The ending to this 20+ year read was superb. I laughed out loud at points where characters dialogue provided light hearted banter and barbs - I cried at the death of one character that I had not expected to die but realized their death was indeed part of the pattern... A well crafted finale to a brilliant series.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie was the best so far i really enjoy the fullest Daniel Craig performance as well as M. even the back story line was wonderfully done.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|If you drive around or use your device in different locales regularly, this app works great to ID networks and signal strength, plus other info. Well worth the free download!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This was a good movie to enjoy. beginning middle and ending. This movie has set things up as a well rounded movie for the family.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I love Jack Reacher. I could not read fast enough as each chapter raced to the finish. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|i enjoy listening to this cd after he won his Grammy really good for a freshman cd. I say go and get it your self music cover a alot of things some deeply meaning the story being told on this journey
B007REV4YI|3.0|Cinematically Skyfall is one of the better Bond movies.  The action is exciting, Daniel Craig is superb as Bond again, the music is done very well and fits with the scenes perfectly.<br /><br />The plot though is completely unbelievable.  I realize you have to take some liberties with reality when watching a Bond movie, but this one is way too far out there.  I won't spoil anything, but somehow the villain has everything so perfectly planned out years in advance that he knows exactly when Bond will identify him, where he will be held, what computer system is going to be used to analyze the data, and that M will be in a meeting with the British Parliament on that very day.  Setting up this whole sequence of events leading to Silva's confrontation with M takes the first 2/3 of the movie and ultimately leaves you with a sense of disappointment when you finally realize that every move Bond, M, Silva, Sévérine, and Patrice ever made was predestined to happen months or even years in advance.  You just have to shake your head in disbelief.<br /><br />The last 1/3 of the movie is better and fills in some of the history on the character of James Bond.  The end of the movie itself is quite satisfying.  Fans of old Bond films will immediately recognize the final scene as being very similar to Sean Connery and Bernard Lee's interactions in the first Bond films.  It provides a fulfilling transition from the Casino Royale - Quantum of Solace - Skyfall prequel trilogy to where Bond first was introduced to the world as the dapper British spy 50 years ago.<br /><br />Overall it was an enjoyable movie even though it won't be worth watching again.  This is not going to be a classic Bond movie, but it does fit in pretty good with the series as a whole.  The 50th year of Bond deserved much better.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|was looking forward to watching this move and i am glad i got it. The family really like the movie a lot of fun to enjoy.
B000YIWF4C|5.0|Love the book, it changes the way you think of what creates value. It is a must read even if you are not an investor.
B0091LS07E|5.0|All i scan say about this cd is i am bias since i always enjoy her music. She still have my attention
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I absolutely love the Swiftkey keyboard.  I have had it for quite some time and it only keeps getting better.  It does a great job of predicting your next words based on the personalization of how you write texts, facebook posts, tweets, etc.  I have been participating in the beta testing of the Flow feature (which is now integrated into regular Swiftkey) and really love it, despite my initial hesitation.  I just wish that Amazon would let me put this on my old Kindle Fire because the keyboard on that is so awful!
