B004JCDWQ4|1.0|The last book of the series was such a let down. I was extremely disappointed to say the least. These were my first books by Moning, and it will be a long while before I read another one of hers!
B004UID2LC|1.0|Used to work. Will not download. Went from 5 stars to 1. Please fix and will give you 5 stars again.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie was very good.  It followed the book.  Reading the book first would help understand some of the things that are happening.  But, I recommend the movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just love carrying my kindle around a having a bible too!  I use it in church and when others say they just know that is what that verse said1
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I looked forward to the second book of the trilogy and  was not disappointed.  The book continued the story of Europe and the from the build up to the second world war to the start of the cold war.  Ken Follett did not disappoint.
B008HK3S04|5.0|This is a great case to tote your Kindle Fire around in. The inside lining is soft, to protect your Kindle from scratches. The outside, is made of a durable material that offers just enough protection, without being too heavy or bulky to carry around. I like the color scheme of this case more than I thought I would. The color has just enough zip to avoid being boring, without being too gaudy. Great case, good price.

B006LRUVUA|5.0|I LOOOOVE, LOOOOVE, LOOOOOVE, TeamViewer.  I have family up and down the East Coast who constantly call for tech support.  They try, but telling me what's wrong and what is REALLY wrong can be very...CONTRASTING.  Then...they want to read every single word on the screen, so by the end of my workday as a Remote Tech support specialist, I'd rather connect to their devices and SEE what's really happening.<br /><br />Thanks, TeamViewer....YOU ROCK!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had finished reading one book before purchasing this book. I was in need of finding a new book and a new author. I came across this book and my aunt was reading it to.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|This story was a quick, fun read. I found myself quite often irritated with Aunt Polly, who seems to become a different (and more selfish) character entirely in the middle of the book. And Pollyanna's naivety could be a bit overdone at times. For someone who enjoys talking to people and exploring as she does, she doesn't seem to actually be a great observer of the human condition. But that said, this book is true to the original's tone and is a reminder of simpler times.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this in 1.5 days. I loved it! It continues right were the first book Bared to You left off. The drama between Gideon and Eva just keeps on rolling. I love all the characters and I can picture being in the story and seeing everything come to life while I am reading it. Great book. Can't wait for number three!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a part of history told by a first person and i enjoyed it very much. At least it is the real thing not made up
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had read the other two books and the third one kept me reading without wanting to put it down. All three books were enjoyable to read.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|the extra cost is for the bonus chapter and not needed to complete the game. however,  you get a little pop-up asking you to buy it when you are in the middle of the game. by putting this in the middle instead of when the game ends it's causing the confusion of paying for the game twice. it was for that reason I knocked a star off my rating. there were a few times when I would enter a different room/scene when all I could see was a black screen with the inventory and book in the corner. most of the time it was under 5 seconds, but there were times when it was up to 20 seconds. I played this on a kindle fire if the devs wanted to look into a fix.<br /><br />in all  this is a fun game. not as challenging as some, but still a good time waster. there is an option to get a strategy guide if you do some kind of facebook thing. but, with the unlimited help &quot;button&quot;  it's not needed.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I choose 1as a rating because i know a dictionary has so many words but don't get it !!!  <br />Merissa
0547564651|5.0|The question I selected as a title for this review is one of several to which Paul Tough responds in this book. The titles of the first four chapters suggest others: How to Fail (and How Not to), How to Build Character, How to Think, and finally, How to Succeed. According to an ancient Africa an aphorism, it takes a village to raise a child. In the Introduction, Tough briefly discusses several research studies whose findings have had a great impact on child development in the U.S. (especially in public schools), for better or worse. He asserts that \\"conventional wisdom about child development over the past two decades has been misguided. We have been focusing on the wrong skills and abilities in our children, and we have been using the wrong strategies to help nurture and teach those skills.\\" If it will take a society to develop a child, what specifically does Tough recommend? Where to begin? What specifically must \\"villagers\\" do?<br /><br />No brief commentary such as mine can possibly do full justice to the scope and depth of material that Tough provides, supplemented by 19 pages of extensively annotated notes. Also, those who have already reviewed the book have identified what they found most important, most valuable to them. Briefly, here are five of the several dozen passages that caught my eye:<br /><br />\\"There is something undeniably compelling about the cognitive hypothesis [i.e. the number of words a child hears from parents early in life determines academic success later]. The world it describes is so neat, so reassuringly linear, such a clear case of inputs [begin italics] here [end italics] to outputs [begin italics] there [end italics].\\" However, in recent years, research conducted by individuals and teams raises questions about many of the assumptions behind the cognitive hypothesis. \\"What matters, instead [of stuffing information in a child's head], is whether we can help that develop a very different set of qualities, a list that includes persistence, self-control, curiosity, conscientiousness, grit, and self-confidence.\\" These are all non-cognitive skills. (Pages xiv-xv)<br /><br />\\"Overloading the HPA axis, especially in infancy and childhood, produces all kinds of serious and long-lasting negative effects -- physical, psychological, and neurological.\\" What's tricky about this process is that \\"it's not actually the stress itself that messes us up. It's the body's [begin italics] reaction [end italics] to the stress...Although the human stress-response system is highly complex in design, in practice it has all the subtlety of a croquet mallet...Your HPA axis, sensing danger, is conserving fluids, preparing to ward off an attack. And you're standing there looking for a glass of water and swallowing hard.\\" The sense of threat is even more terrifying for a child. (Page 13)<br /><br />For infants to develop qualities like perseverance and focus, \\"they need a high level of warmth and nurturance from their caregivers (e.g. parents, other family members, teachers, coaches, and clergy]...when children reach early adolescence, what motivates them most effectively isn't licking and grooming-style care but a very different kind of attention. Perhaps what pushes middle school students to practice as maniacally as [Elizabeth] Spiegel's chess players do is the unexpected experience of someone taking them seriously, believing in their abilities, and challenging them to improve themselves.\\" (120-121)<br /><br />Neuroscientists have discovered that \\"the most reliable way to produce an adult who is brave and curious and kind and prudent is to ensure that when he is an infant, his hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis functions well. And how do you do that? It's not magic. First, as much as possible, you protect him from serious trauma and chronic stress; then, even more important, you provide him with a secure, nurturing relationship with at least one parent and ideally two. That's not the whole secret of success, but it is a big, big part of it.\\" (182)<br /><br />Tough explains that, rather than making a case for the economic value of better-educated students who will add greater value to society, \\"the argument that resonates more with me is a purely personal one. When I spend time with children growing up in adversity, I can't help but feel two things. First, a sense of anger for what they've already missed...Which leads to my second reaction: a feeling of admiration and hope when I watch young people making the difficult and often painful choice to follow a better path, to turn away from what might have seemed like their inevitable destiny...And every day they pull themselves up one more rung on the ladder to a more successful future...They did not get onto that ladder alone. They are there only because someone helped them to take the first step.\\"<br /><br />I share Paul Tough's hope that those who read his book will follow Elizabeth Siegel's example and seize every opportunity to provide children with \\"the unexpected experience of someone taking them seriously, believing in their abilities, and challenging them to improve themselves.\\" Help them to locate a \\"ladder\\" and then take the first step up. Thus begins what is certain to be a difficult climb for them but one made somewhat easier by knowing they are not alone. In years to come, many of the young ladder climbers will then help other children to achieve success. That is a compelling vision, one that simply must become a reality.s a big, big part of it.\\" (182)<br /><br />Tough explains that, rather than making a case for the economic value of better-educated students who will add greater value to society, \\"the argument that resonates more with me is a purely personal one.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love to read and my aunt told me about the fifty shades. I had to read it. I read the first one and couldn't wait to read the second one. I really enjoyed it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The drama that embodies Eva and Gideon's life together certainly does not disappoint in this much anticipated sequel. I thoroughly enjoyed this read and read oober slow today because I did not want this rollercoaster ride to end. Absolutely stunning and can't wait for book 3 in December! Bravo Mrs. Day :)
0307346609|5.0|At first I was skeptical of the book being written in short story fashion, but now that I've read half of it I realize that this aspect is what keeps you on the edge of your seat. It allowed the writer to describe different places and times during the conflict using a large amount of detail while at the same time being able to flip flop around from story type to story type without becoming stagnate. Loving it thus far.
B005PK553C|5.0|In reality there is not that much gore and grossness in this show like you see in many modern movies-- what there is is suspense, drama and bending of reality. It's a thrill! It keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Fully recommended, one of my favorite new shows in the last 5 years.
B005HSL626|5.0|i love this game, i like this game more than other game in my device.you should download it and play it.goodluck for you.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|P!nk's latest recording is both entertaining, amusing and revealing.  As always she sings and writes of life's trials and tribulations but from a completely unique perspective.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Don't let the nay-sayers fool you, TEMPEST is prime-Dylan. Bob's newest is rich, powerful, and an enjoyable listen.<br />Caution: The record must be played at least 10 times to really catch its subtle power. Another great one from an artis we should never take for granted.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|Resident Evil Damnation has a lot more action than the last CGI movie.  I enjoyed it, and even tho there are some cheesy one liners from Leon, and another American wanna be character (that just came off as annoying), the rest of the film has the classic resident evil feel that I've missed so very long.  I couldn't help but think that this is what a future resident evil game could look like. They made it seem at times that you were playing a classic resident evil game. The Ada fight scene was over the top, but still fun to watch. If you liked the last CGI movie, you'll love this most likely. The story line was decent.  In the beginning I was getting a little dozy, but the action picked up not too far behind. I think they learned from the mistakes of the first movie. The voice acting was decent, and the graphics where nice too. I don't want to give up any of the Movie.<br />  I hope they keep making these movies. It seems that it's the closest thing your going to get going back to the survival horror franchise. I do wish they did cut out some of the slower scenes, but overall it was a really good movie and I think any resident evil fan would love to have this in their collection.
B000OOMXYI|4.0|it's a 72nd ish size Vader's TIE , shipment was quick and well packed.<br />scale seems a bit small but looks good with my other 72nd scale fighters.<br />model comes prepaianted and molded in a dark blue/grey.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I bought this not knowing what it was about. Poorly written, with not much of a storyline. Ridiculous sex descriptions which became boring after a while.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected In You contained much more of Gideon and Eva's insecurities, wants, and needs. Overall I loved this book. Sylvia made it much more her own and Gideon is more likeable to me than Christian Grey. The sex scenes are hotter, and the rest of the characters have bigger focal points and are better developed. I feel like I know every character.<br />There were many things that I didn't see coming towards the middle of the book. Eva seems needy and clingy but she is only being true to herself. She seems helpless, but the difference between this and say Ana and Christian or even Bella and Edward is that she fights just as much back. She's not afraid to hurt his feelings when she's angry.<br />I can't wait to see where Gideon and Eva's relationship goes to now that he has opened up and they both trust each other. I'm looking foward yet sad to read the last installment of this wonderful couple!!!!! I'm afraid my New Year's Eve will be sitting down with a wonderful book!
B005CKPQHA|5.0|This has to be the best show on TV. The acting is fantastic, and the storyline keeps us glued to the TV. It's addicting. Watched the first 3 or 4 seasons quickly.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was brought to my attention by friends for me to review first before they decide to buy and read. Downloaded sample on my Kindle at 9pm and I was hooked. So I purchased the entire book in Kindle and read it in 24 hours. Later bought the paperback for my bookshelf. I love this book for the level of maturity with the main characters; in so many words without getting descriptive.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Suspense novel where the author keeps your wondering what is really going on?  No worries, all is revealed in the end.  Here's hoping that your marriage is nothing like the character's in the book :)
B008G12ERC|5.0|Oh Muse, I have been a fan since you released 'Absolution' and I've got to say you've come a long way since then.<br /><br />What a fantastic album! on first hearing it there's something very cheerful and laid back about the music, not as intense and as out there as 'The Resistance'. Lets face it though, people never like change. Although this album is very different it still carries a sound that fundamentally belongs to Muse.<br /><br />From the perspective of a music teacher, nearly every song in this album is very solid, well structured and well written. Even the repeating motif in 'Isolation' is hauntingly beautiful (which I have seen other reviewers criticise). Muse have an advanced understanding of harmony which leads them to composing songs with interesting and out-there chord progressions. Probably the biggest reason why I like Muse so much.<br /><br />Interesting sidenote: Muse like to quote little snippets of 19th Century Romantic composers (mostly Rachmaninoff!). In the song 'Prelude', they take a melody from Rachmaninoff's 2nd piano concerto, 2nd movement and then quote a melody from Chopin's etude 'Tristesse'. It's such a fantastic arrangement which leads comically into the next song: 'Survivor'.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Want to get entertain for a couple of days? This is your book, from the beginning you are hook in the characters and you just can't put it down,of course is not literature and towards the end you just have to use your disbelief ,but the very end is chilling. Great for a rainy day!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|An awesome game just got better. Love the new levels and the new character. I really appreciated the factthat the new stuff isn't merely the same content. The new character adds a whole new element to gameplay. If you liked it before you'll love it now. If you've never played it before then get it now....you won't regret it!!
B00855B27C|5.0|This cd goes to show that TestAmenT doesnt need to be included in the Big 4 hoopla for they are in a class all on their own . In my opinion TestAmenT dont need to open for any band .I wish they would form a Big 5 extravaganza featuring : Forbidden. Exodus. Death Angel.Dark Angel & TestAmenT headlining. Oh ok back to the cd this is the band at their very best I really dig this release and think it should be voted the best album of 2012 in the rag mags of metal. TestAmenT rules Nuff Said.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the dynamic between Gideon and Eva.  It had me craving for more. I can't wait for the final book..<br />I finished it in 2 days. I definitely will recommend it to friends and family.
B001TAJGO6|4.0|Was Under the impression that I was ordering the \\"two disc\\" special edition with deleted scenes, instead I received a regular one, so my hopes were up but still received what I intended
B0073XORLU|4.0|Back in the day I was a huge fan of Jethro Tull. Saw them in concert in the early 70's right around the time of Thick As A Brick. About the time \\"Songs from the Wood\\" came out I had lost interest and \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\" was an embarrassment each time I heard it on the radio. A few months back I discovered that Ian Anderson was coming to my town with his \\"TAAB2\\" tour so I thought I'd give this album a shot because I was definitely attending the concert. Upon the first few listens I was not overly enthusiastic about TAAB2. Well, about a week ago I went to the concert. If you've seen Jethro Tull/Ian Anderson then you know he is a no nonsense, well rehearsed and tight performer. I was not disappointed as \\"Thick as a Brick\\" wound to a close. I never could have imagined that I would enjoy \\"TAAB2\\" even more! I have been listening to this album intensely since and think it is right up there with his best \\"back in the day\\". Anderson puts a lot of thought into his lyrics and laces them with sarcasm, wit and cynicism. The music is very good and again, very reminiscent of the early years without seeming re-hashed or outdated. The electric guitar player rips but is not allowed to overdo it, much like the album \\"Aqualung\\". You get the best of Anderson's flute, acoustic guitar and vocals along with the aforementioned electric guitar, bass, keyboards, drummer and the youngest member of the band on occasional vocals. Overall it works for me and I'm happy to say \\"welcome back Jethro Tull\\"!
B000002UJQ|5.0|this cd is pretty much amazing...buy it now.<br />radiohead reminds me of pink floyd alot.<br />and if any one says muse is better than radiohead ill punch you in the face. muse is a watered down version of radiohead.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Made in 2011, Homeland is a decent 12 episode drama telling the story of US marine Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) who has returned to the US after surviving eight years of being captured by enemy forces. He is keenly placed under surveillance by CIA operative Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) who, in her obsessive approach, is determined to confirm that he has turned into a supporter of the enemy during his time away.<br />This is a tense quality series which throws up a few surprises here and there. Fine acting from all the cast, although I feel that some of the cast would have been better cast if more real looking women were playing some roles rather than the model-like actors featured here.<br />Series 2 starts shortly in the US and I'd be keen to see how that plays out too.<br />The DVD set has some extras inclusing a very short Prologue to Season 2, a half hour behind the scenes feature, some episode commentaries and some deleted scenes.<br />Well worth the watch if you appreciate a decent drama.

0316228532|1.0|Sorry, but this is one more example of my frustration at having purchased a kindle.  $17.99 for a blast or electronic digits.  $17.90 for a brand new hardcover.  People can talk about it being Publisher's fault all they want.  Paying more, even nine cents more, for a digital version over a hardcover is simply wrong.
0525953728|5.0|The book was very interesting to read and I found it hard to put down; I finished it in two days. I really enjoyed reading about the training process for SEALs and \\"Mark Owen\\" took me through the process of advanced SEAL training which I felt was imperative for a reader to fully understand and appreciate how the SEALs train as a Brotherhood to keep our Republic and our interests safe when called upon. I enjoyed reading about the raid on the compound and how this team of SEALs addressed each issue they confronted with professionalism and determination. A GREAT book to read if you're interested in how our military professionals give up so much in order to keep this country safe.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|Nikolaj Coster - Waldau's breakthrough film was Nightwatch, a 1994 Danish horror in which he starred with The Killing actress Sofie Grabol. Here he plays the part of a CEO being headhuinted by a Norwegian firm.<br />Headhunters is a fine film which I enjoyed more than I expected. A fine cast and decent script led me to watch this and the time flew by. I have not yet read the book but hope to do so soon.<br />If the Norwegians can make Jo Nesbo's novels as good as this on film, hopefully they can repeat this perfection with Nesbo's Harry Hole novels.<br />If it's a decent caper you're after or something other than the usual US offerings, then Headhunters is a very decent alternative.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Papa Roach evolve their sound a little bit more with each album, but they still know what works for them and hit upon it with abundance on their latest disc `The Connection.'<br />Singer Jacoby Shaddix said earlier this year, \\"What `The Connection' means to us, it's our connection to the music. It's the connection of this music to the fans. It's the connection that we make onstage with our music ... It's just this connection that Papa Roach than us sitting in a room jamming. It's larger than life now and we're just the facilitators for that, so it's just painfully obvious that this is what it needs to be.\\"<br /><br />With that in mind, the band mines the well of interpersonal connections again with their latest record. Shaddix, a master at baring his soul in tracks like `Last Resort,' `Scars,' and `Broken Home,' puts his heart clearly on his sleeve with the standout track `Before I Die.' The song, which incorporates some early piano work before fully rocking out, talks about pushing a loved one away while still feeling the urge to live for them.<br /><br />And where `Before I Die' is a more painful track, the misnomer `Leader of the Broken Hearts' actually comes off as one of the more triumphant songs on the disc. On it, Shaddix revels in the pain that comes from a broken heart, knowing that even though a relationship has ended, there's an elation that came from putting it all on the line that's made him feel alive like never before.<br /><br />As Shaddix has stated, `The Connection' is also about the relationship of the music to their fans, and there are a number of rocking tracks on here that should eventually connect on the concert stage. Tony Palermo's `Dr. Feelgood'-like drumming and the riffage of guitarist Jerry Horton and bassist Tobin Esperance on `Where Did the Angels Go' provide the intensity of a great live song. Esperance and Horton also drive `Wish You Never Met Me' with a killer bass opening and wailing guitar solo. And for those who like the rap-rocksound of the band's early work, `Not That Beautiful' is a late album gem with Shaddix waxing poetic about putting a loved one on a pedestal.<br /><br />The other major connection P-Roach make is to their own journey to get where they are today. The band has seen the highs and the lows and emerged as one of music's most consistently rocking acts, which makes `Still Swingin'` not only the perfect song for a lead single, but essentially the anthem that describes their career path. Where many of their peers that started on the scene in the late '90s and early 2000s have faded away, Papa Roach have survived, and are the ones still swinging and connecting with fans.

I did that with Eat, Pray, Love and as much as I love watching Julia Roberts, the movie did not match up to the book with my imaginations.  I just ordered and received Book 2 and 3 of the Hunger Game Series.  Will be awhile before I can comment.

B00976NY6A|4.0|Not sure if they are intentionally trying to have a more \\"mature\\" sound but Battle Born has a different sound/feel than I'm used to from The Killers.  That being said, it is a very solid album.  It took a few spins for it to grow on me, but grow on me it did.  Like to see them get back to a more relaxed approach but this is certainly a worthy addition to your collection.
0062059882|3.0|I found this book boring. I cannot say it was written badly, not at all, but there were moments when i wished it would become more interesting but it would not. the pacing was slow, it was too long for me. I guess Neil Gaiman is not my type of writer.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|fun, mysterious, exciting. little lag when moving in A few places, other than that it was great. I recommend it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|as good as any other Reacher novel. well paced and exciting, also the plot line is believable.I certainly recommend it highly to anyone out there.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|While the fist book, Bare to You, had similar lines as 50 shades this 2nd book in this series changed up the characters IMHO.  I enjoyed the read and while at times I found my self at odds with their feelings I could see how they easily fell for each other so quickly.  They are soul mate characters and from the time they became involved there would be no other for them.  If you liked the first book for sure read this one.  I have already pre-ordered the 3rd one.
B008XG1X18|1.0|New version freezes and stalls.  I have had to force close it multiple times every time I use it! Hate it. give me the old one back and I'll give you 5 stars.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this case today for 80 bucks plus tax & when I took it home to put on my phone I loved it. But when I started to text I was unhappy. The plastic screen caused the keys to not be touched. Plus the earphone jack required an extension which I hated especially because I'm a runner. Other people may love the case but I was very unhappy to the point I took it back today as well.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I'm a big fan of point and click games as well as find the object. This game is a great mix of both. Easy to dive into and can be difficult depending on game setting. Worth the $1 I spent and lasted me three days, about maybe six hours or more. My only gripe is that it ends on a cliffhanger. But if you don't mind that, make sure to check it out. Works fine on Kindle Fire. If you play the demo, don't upgrade from the game. Upgrade through the Amazon app store. If it has trouble unlocking, delete the demo and then redownload the full game.
B005XLN7EC|5.0|My niece LOVES tangled. Unfortunately, the first thing she wants to do (she's 5), is tear the clothes off. So I cut the crown off the head(It's attached to the head by that plastic they put on the barbies now). Even as an adult, I love tangled and the doll. Her arms and legs don't bend, as previously stated in another review. Once the tiara is cut off, it doesn't stay on very well for play, but that's probably why it's meant to be a permanent attachment. It's the nicest doll I've seen in this style.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|A good choice and interesting read.  Cannot wait to get the next installments that follow this title.  Scary to think that this happens in real life too
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book held my interest i want more. it completely different from fifty shades of grey, it has more drama which i love. The only thing is waiting for the third book

B00004XQ83|4.0|I recently watched \\"Down from the Mountain\\" on DVD and was amazed by may of the performances.  I purchased this CD thinking I would get the entire show, but it only includes 12 tracks.  Most of the songs I wanted were included, but wish they had all of them.  Excellent CD overall.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|My dad loves this movie so much I just had to get it for him for his birthday this year
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I bought and read the first two but couldn't wait to get to a book store to find out what happened next so downloaded the last book, Fifty Shades Freed.  It was the most exciting of the three books with lots of action and more adventure.  It's the first electronic book that I've read and it was great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is addictive and challenging as you go up in grids.  I have showed this game to sevral friends and family and they too have become addictted.  Sone Flows are easy and others seem impossible. I'm starting on round two and anxious to see if I beat my original score.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have all the angry birds games and this one seems to go quicker.  Can get to three stars quicker then the Space version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game to pass the time. The ads don't bother me at all. Fun to share with others as well...especially when you can't get past a level.
B000Z45PEC|4.0|Some parts looks cheap and not so real, but overall it is a very nice model to collect, you can even leave it in the box and still appreciate the car.
B000ZMVAXO|3.0|This thing is great when you first start using it, but it sucks up battery power like CRAZY! You can put fresh batteries in, and 3 days later they'll be depleted completely.
B004SBX112|5.0|Lots of fun and the time flies when playing.  Really like all the sound effects and the giggling of the birds, silly I know but it's cute.
B00992CF6W|2.0|First the game feels lonely because their is not any animals and you can't get any fur/meat and the tools don't work.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|WOW..was so excited to get this CD and all expectations were gone once I played it...needless to say, this will collect dust or go on Ebay...not good at all, not like the younger Diana. Not sure what happened but maybe it's time she re-groups and start over.  Oh well...you win some you lose some...oh and not liken the CD cover at ALL! What the heck was she thinking???
B007RI56NY|4.0|I don't know how big of a Train fan I was before but I really like this album. There's definitely variety in the types of songs that make it up. All in all its pretty good. :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the first book, Hungar Games. I read it in one night.  I couldn't wait to buy the 3rd book.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Good action but need more basic information on minions  to destroy.  Hard to figure out how to complete the specific bonus tasks.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a MUST read for anyone, especially teens. I read the entire Trilogy within a weekend, I couldn't put my iPad down, I was anxious to find out what would happen next.<br />Very well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat (so to speak) .
B0060CV31C|5.0|Great Disney animation movie. Humor for both parents and children. The online streamed video also doesn't have the glitch most DVD's had of certain lines being cut out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this social media site. I use it for work and it keeps me very organized, and having the app on my kindle helps me stay connected to it.:)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love playing this game it's a very competented game I love it.  My family and friend enjoy playing it to great game it a must buy.
0307592731|2.0|The story is well written, that is the ONLY reason for reading this book.  I feel if the author wrote the book as fiction it would rate higher for me.  I don't believe half of what she wrote.  How can she possibly remember all the events? And really, how does one remember what someone wore 20 years after the fact, not just one person but dozens.  How do you remember what you ate 20 years ago?  I found myself irritated with the author throughout the book.  Her lack of being prepared and common sense were issues that I found unbelievable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had  me  in every moment glued to each page. I loved this book so much i could read it over and over again.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|My only complainant really is that some of the bigger items I want cost real money and I hate that. Why do I have to spend my real hard yearned money on a virtual turkey?
B007MNV5WU|4.0|It must be good...it keeps my grandson (5) busy and happy for hours at a time if I would let him play it that long.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Love the whole series, and this one lived up to expectations.  Very unpredictable, as new characters pop up all the time, to bring in a new storyline.  Keeps you interested.  Thumbs up from me!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just read this book in about 3 hrs.. With some interuptions in between. Love this story, this couple and especially Cary.. Eva and Gideon are hot and cold and this makes you feel like you are on a rollar coaster with a bunch of loop de loops.. Love the psychological aspect of these books. It puts certain things into perspective and makes you think about people and life in general. Without giving up any spoilers as I think if you read Bared to you, you need to read this sequel. I will say tissues needed towards the end. I have already ordered the final book and can't wait until its released. Love Sylvia Day and her work.. Brilliant!
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I was surprised how much I liked this movie. I approached it as a bit of action-adventure-comic book escape. It turned out to be quite a bit more than that. There is some serious thematic material subtly woven in, for example the strength of the original heart. And our expectation about who the bad guys really are gets turned on its head.  I also really loved the chemistry between RDJ and Gwyneth Paltrow. They smoked in a beautifully understated way. All in all, I found it a very satisfying 2+ hours, me who is pretty much the polar opposite of a 12-year-old boy. (But fear not, there is plenty in the film to satisfy that heart as well. Very endearing, actually.) Two thumbs way up.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is not impossible, but it's not easy either. Great graphics and story line. I can't wait for the next one!
B0087DIEGE|5.0|This lens cover is a great addition to a great camera, it's a pity Olympus did not ship it with the camera.<br /><br />There were two things I did not like about the XZ-1, one was the push-on, pull-off lens cap dangling from a string, and this item cures that, and the other was the long neck strap which I replaced with this item: http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Adjustable-Wrist-compact-cameras/dp/B001TKYMTA/ref=pd_sim_p_15<br /><br />Those two things made this camera nearly pocketable, and much more convenient and fun to use.<br /><br />I think that most all XZ-1 owners want this lens cover.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. It took me a little while to get a handle on the 2 different perspectives of telling this story. But then I was hooked. And shocked by the twists and turns and it had me shaking my head many times, saying, \\"WHAT?!\\" But I truly could not put it down and read it in 2 sittings. And it was really dark and kind of creepy, especially when you realize that it could happen to you.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app no longer works it starts and stops every download I attempt in any available format this program offers. I have the galaxy tab 10.1 running on software version 4.0 .4
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|For a combo pack, the media box is rather thin, so when I was taking off the plastic cover, to my surprise the case was broken in half. The only thing that held it together was the case cover. This is so sad.. Plus they made it so cheap, that the disc is top of each other, not with each individual case. Maybe its just the pre-order, the price was too low for a good quality case?<br /><br />Saw the movie twice in the theater in 3D, again on my own 3D setup, looked great.
0817439390|5.0|I received this book for Christmas in 2011 and I adore it. The author writes in an extremely friendly, easy to understand way with plenty of photo examples to illustrate his points. I sort of wish the book were a little more compact, but that's my only, tiny, nitpicky critique. I've perused this book during some rare free time and definitely have retained some of his take aways. If you're the slightest bit confused about getting the right lighting for your photos, this is the perfect guide.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fun and challenging to play. Each level was very well done,  and had me thinking. I gave it 5 stars based on the fun factor and the technical aspects.
B000V8A95C|5.0|After listening to this on Pandora for weeks and weeks, I decided to purchase the original Broadway cast version.  I absolutely love it.  My fiance is sick of it now, and I wish I cared, but I don't.  Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are genuinely perfect for these roles.  BUY IT.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved, loved,loved this book.  The story continues so well from book 1 and it does not disappoint.  Love Gideon, Eva and Cary.  The characters all blend well together.  The story had me laughing, crying and cringing too.  Only draw back to this is that I have to wait until December for book 3.  I can hardly wait.  Sylvia Day, I love all of your books.  You are truly an awesome writer.  Thank you so much.  Loved it.
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|It's my fault. I misread the label on the movie description. I am a little disappointed that there was not a movie on the DVD. The material on the DVD is fantastic but I wanted the movie part of Star Wars. I went on amazon.com and ordered the right Star Wars movie this time. I have the Trilogy on VHS and with the Original Cast but I wanted the movie on DVD.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I've had this app for 9 months and have not had any problems. I can follow conditions for each of my kids and my parents and still know how to prepare for my day. It will open to whichever favorite location you choose - nice when on vacation.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You<br />What a roller coaster ride.<br />I have this love/hate dependence for Gideon Cross.<br />I like that the book picks up where the first one ended.<br />Gideon still the controlling dominant sex hard body unable to keep his<br />hands and other body parts off of Eva.<br />Eva still lusting after Gideon knows a relationship needs more<br />than a physical connection to endure but she'll take what she can get.<br />They both have issues, each victims of abuse early in life.<br />Eva has shared her story of abuse with Gideon but he isn't ready<br />to share his.<br />Nathan Barker is Eva's stepbrother and the reason for Eva's nightmares.<br />He raped Eva when she was younger.<br />Something happens that has Gideon distancing himself from Eva<br />causing her great pain and self doubt.<br />I couldn't figure out what was going on in his head and that's<br />when I hated Gideon.<br />And then it became clear; and that's when I loved him again.<br />I love the series and can't wait for the next one!
8866130885|3.0|Perhaps I purchased this product without thoroughly reading the description, but generally planners are for academic years, not calendar years. I purchased this product for use at school and then discovered it wouldn't be useful until January.<br /><br />While I'm disappointed about the usefulness of the product, I must say it's an incredibly fun and well-made little notebook.

B008B3MZNI|5.0|An edit - I am beginning to realize that the \\"absurdly grainy picture\\" may be only coming from film shot by one camera. The one in the center of the rear of the arena. That would explain some of the below picture problems.<br /><br />Yep, this Supertramp Bluray works fine on my American Sony player. (Relief!) I have known for decades that this concert was filmed so have always been disappointed that it was never released on VHS or, later, DVD. So I was quite excited when I learned that it was finally being released, and as a BluRay with DTS HD sound to boot!! My one concern?...it was an import!!<br /><br />As I posted on the comments of some of these other reviews, region coding isn't the only thing you have to worry about, there's also the format, PAL vs. NTSC. We use the latter, Europe uses the former, and regional coding is just another kind of copyguard. So just telling me it's region 0, without telling me the format of the disc itself, is no guarantee at all.<br /><br />In fact I have ½ dozen import concert (regular) DVDs, and a few movies, that I was guaranteed would work because they were region 0, but when they arrived I discovered that, yep, they were PAL format and wouldn't work in any of my players. Of course there are multi-format players available (and for under $100 too!) and there's also software that will convert and burn onto a DVDr, which is what I did for the other DVDs. Of course, with a BluRay I can't do that (yet)!<br /><br />But I went ahead and purchased it after one reviewer assured me that he actually owned the BluRay and it worked fine (so thanks Neil!)<br /><br />On to the review.........<br /><br />First thing - the DTS HD sounds AWESOME!! One of the more drastic improvements over PCM stereo I have heard yet (there is no Dolby track). Of course DTS is almost always an improvement over other sound formats but it's usually a matter of \\"opening up\\" the soundscape or adding \\"punch\\" to the sound. In this case it's almost like my tweeters aren't even working in stereo mode. There is a considerable boost in high range when using the DTS HD.<br /><br />DARN grainy picture though. Weird, especially considering the source was film, which I can only assume has deteriorated (and they didn't want to pay for a \\"Hollywood-level\\" restoration)!! Can't really tell in brightly lit scenes, like close ups of band members, but BAD in low light scenes. Especially those taken from the cameras at the back of the venue.<br /><br />I can also do without what I call the \\"artsy fartsy\\" visuals, like playing movies while the songs are playing (an old B&W train sequence over the middle of Rudy for example). I never have liked that, just show me the darn concert, that's what I paid for!!<br /><br />Or at least give me the feature to turn it off!! (A perfect example of this is Yes' 9021Live DVD which allows you to remove the visuals and animation and just watch the \\"raw\\" concert footage.)<br /><br />There are also 5 songs that were recorded on one of the other nights, not the night that was filmed (probably the same audio tracks that are on the CD). They added them as bonus tracks with newly created visual animation. While it's nice they included them, I am slightly disappointed because I was looking forward to \\"seeing\\" Ain't Nobody but Me, You Started Laughing and From Now On.<br /><br />But we all know many bands vary their setlists from night to night. And the DVD does have several tracks not on the album/CD, including Goodbye Stranger, Give a Little Bit and Another Man's Woman.<br /><br />Bottom line - despite the grainy picture, and speaking as a long-time Supertramp fan who counts the (now 32 year-old) album of this among his top-20 all time favorite live albums, this BluRay is definitely worth it to me, even at the import price!<br /><br />Oh - and shipping from England was under 2 weeks!n't even working in stereo mode.

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|fun game but some items hard to see but still enjoyed it .if you like hidden object games this is a good one
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is the second in the Cross Fire series.  And omg it is full of surprises, love, jealousy, and hot sex.  Eva and Gideon continue their relationship using sex to fix their problems, but as they continue to grow, so does their love and they are able to balance their relationship. It was heartwarming reading their story.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down for one minute, eventhough I was sleepy and knew that I needed to wake up the next day early to take my daughter to school.  I just loved this book it was so unique and full of surprises that had me gasping and saying out loud OMG I can't believe it.<br /><br />I loved that their was another character, that brought out Gideon's jealousy side; hopefully we will continue reading about Brett.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book.
B006TXDOZ0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of these guys. Currently one of my favorates from an exhausting pallet of musical tastes.<br /><br />Has anyone bought the actual CD? and are the lyrics printed in the insert by chance?<br />I'm dying to know the lyrics to \\"LIES\\". None of the lyrics on the internet are correct, this much I know. There's two interpretations circulating and they're copy/pastes of eachother. Neither are right; specifically the first two lines in the first verse.<br /><br />If theres lyrics, I'll buy the album just for that reason. Even though I've already bought digital versions of all three albums..

1400069289|3.0|The fact that it was an easy read is both a strength and a weakness.  It was breezy compared to similar books on the broad topic (Kahneman's \\"Thinking Fast and Slow\\" or that marketing guy's book about functional MRI's).  Like a lot of bad comedy movies, though, the best parts were in the trailer, the NYT article from last winter.  Aside from that great article's explanation of how corporations get to know you better than you know your own self, this book didn't have a whole lot to offer.<br /><br />Thank goodness for libraries.

B004GYY714|5.0|I have Xm radio. I like it but I found this app for my Kindel and it works just as good and tons of more stations
1401233791|5.0|I bought this on Amazon's mark down for $17.94. I do not think that I would pay the full retail price of $29.99 for it, but I grabbed it at this price as it is a great deal for this large a collection.<br /><br />It's a fairly sizable collection- unlike previous comic collections which mark themselves as the first \\"volume\\" and only have a couple hundred pages the most, this one clocks in at over 600 pages. I was worried at first that this was purely a case of quantity over quality, but the issues collected within are great, and even the filler is bearable. For the most part, a newcomer to the Batman series can pick up the beginning of Knightfall and understand the story quickly as it doesn't rely on previous story arcs all that much (just know Batman is still bummed out about the death of the previous Robin, Jason Todd). It also adds some interesting stories set within the world, including two that follow Scarecrow and Anarky. It also includes the origin story on Bane that was published afterwards, which I think is a good way to add some further depth to Bane.<br /><br />The art, like many comics, varies depending on which issue is read, so it might be jarring for some (especially in the Shadow of the Bat Scarecrow special). Overall the quality to me was good for all of the artists involved, and I think is a good highlight of how varied art can be in the American comics scene.<br /><br />The only complaint I would have about this collection, having read Knightfall for the first time in my life, is that the story references a prior confrontation with Bane by both Jean-Paul and Killer Croc. I found myself trying to flip around the volume looking for this, but I guess these were printed before the Knightfall arc was formally started. The paper quality leaves something to be desired, so be careful handling it.<br /><br />Highly recommended from me, especially if Amazon has it marked down in price.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed this book from start to finish.  I was impressed with all that the public does not know about the training and duties of the Seals.  It was a good read and the book was informative.  All to often the government manipulates the stories to fool the public and it was nice to hear the actual facts of the story.  I do not feel the author should be in any trouble for writting the book, as many lies as the politicians pull off daily, it was a refreshment to hear the truth.

I have already Pre-Ordered It!  ~WAITING IMPATIENTLY~
B00871C09S|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock had a unique style and his films are readily identifiable. High on the list is 'Rear Window', which contains several of Hitchcock's trademarks.<br /><br />First on the list is that Hitchcock's approach to mystery thrillers is quite different to most writers and filmmakers (to those who say that Hitchcock didn't write his movies, I can only say that a military commander doesn't fight his battles, but he controls those who do!). Usually in other people's mysteries a cast of characters is paraded in front of the viewer and the game is to guess which one is the murderer. In Hitchcock's films, it's pretty obvious who the murderer is, the question is how to pin the crime on them- preferably before they do it again. In 'Rear Window' Hitchcock plays up this aspect of the movie to its utmost, giving the lead male character a handicap which means that he can't do anything himself and has to act through others. Hitch builds the tension to an edge-of-the seat climax, in which both male and female leads are in mortal danger. Do they survive? Watch and find out.<br /><br />Then there's the claustrophobic setting. Many of Hitchcock's movies are developed from plays, but even when they aren't ('Rear Window' was developed from a short story), he tends to eschew large-scale settings and has the action take place in confined (literally in this case) quarters. This adds to the tension; anyone who has had a nightmare in which it seems impossible to escape a terrifying situation will know the feeling of paralysing fear that is induced and Hitchcock creates that feeling better than any other filmmaker. Much of this movie takes place within a single room, with the world outside observed as though it were on TV. When the TV world intrudes on the lives of the lead characters, they can't escape.<br /><br />Hitchcock liked to work with actors (and crew) with whom he felt comfortable and this movie contains a number of Hitch stalwarts, most notably James Stewart and Grace Kelly in the leading roles. They interpret their characters splendidly and are backed up by the feisty Thelma Ritter, adding light relief. There is also a group of characters whose job is create atmosphere by being observed going about their daily business and Hitchcock makes sure their stories, comical, tragic and sometimes embarrassing, are entertaining enough to make watching them seem a justifiable pastime.<br /><br />Hitchcock's films are always worth watching for entertainment, but the more you see them, the more you appreciate the technique of one of the cinema's greatest storytellers.in the leading roles.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved Catching Fire. Sequels are often a let down, but Catching Fire did a marvelous job of taking the Hunger Games to the next surprising level.  Both left me wanting more of the story and did not disappoint.
0143119680|5.0|I'm sure there are tons of reviews about this book, so I won't bore you with details.<br />It took me quite a while to read this book because 'life' got in the way of my normal reading habits (it happens).<br /><br />It was great and I really enjoyed it! So much in fact that half way through the book, I purchased the sequel, Shadow of Night.<br />The writing is wonderful and I loved ALL the details. I could perfectly imagine the library in Oxford, the books, Diana's apartment, the Clairmont estate and her family home, with all the extra rooms (lol).<br /><br />Yes, I could have read 3-4 YA books in the same amount of time, but sometimes I enjoy 'soaking-up' a book. I felt the same when I read Outlander by Diana Gabaldon and The Help by Kathryn Stokett, although different genres and massive in size, the books held my interest the entire time.<br /><br />Kudos to Harkness for writing such a wonderful book. I can't wait to read the sequel =)

B0091REZMW|4.0|it is a really great game for its free price tag, my one complaint s that crystals have to be used for a lot of things and they are hard to find and get.
1612130283|2.0|Having been in the BD/SM community for a few years already, I'm missing the hype that this series of books has brought on. But then, if I look at the regular, vanilla society where this type of sexual play is \\"taboo,\\" then I understand why all these women are going goo-goo gaa-gaa for it...and their partners for the after effects. For me, I found it to be rather irritating most times because of the lack of honest and open communication between the two main characters, which is a MUST for this type of sexual and emotional play. In addition, I was bored and it didn't get my engines running like all my vanilla girlfriends promised, but they didn't know I've already been in the \\"scene,\\" which is why, I'm sure, I was bored with this book. I'd say for the masses, it's wonderful that it's bringing something taboo out in the open - I just wish that if the author was going to do that, she would have also felt more responsibility to slip in the extreme importance of open and honest communication, paid more attention to limits (both hard and soft), and stressed the importance of a healthy emotional state of mind and trust for the dominant before beginning this type of play.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good way to relax and calm down at the end of the day. some of the games need a better description of how to play the game.
B007FO5PYK|5.0|I love Al Pacino, but this is one of my favorite movies by him. My boyfriend turned me on to it 5 years ago, it IS his favorite, and now were both very excited to have it on Bluray.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I love it if I could play longer. without paying for coins but 10 minutes has been my Max time before running out of coins
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The first book ended so abruptly that I had to buy the second and then the third.They were a good read but three books were enough of this couple.  It will be interesting to see how this story line comes out on the silver screen.  I imagine it will focus mostly on the relationship as a lot of the story is beyond R rated.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Do yourself a great big favor and buy all of the books at once. You'll realize your stupid for not doing that if you just by the first one and read it.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love this app but it will randomly crash and foreclose. That becomes really annoying when you love pinning things and you are constantly restarting the app

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe Walsh you crazy bastard, how can you remember all the crazy things that happened to you all these years? great sounding album, love all the songs fun to listen too. bring more
B008PE9GSA|3.0|I can never find fault with anything Billy Gibbons does, for me there is really nothing to fault on the songwriting or playing...it's ZZ Top. As others have mentioned get the version at Best Buy for the bonus tracks, two of the better songs on the cd.     Where this falls down the stairs is the same thing that most modern recordings suffer from.... the volume level and lack of dynamic range. It's too high, it's distorted (not the good kind), overly compressed and quickly becomes tiresome to listen too.  Listen to this album on a stereo with meters to understand why it doesnt grab you like it should....the meters don't move, in other words it's flat with no dynamics.  There may have been some feel in the studio when they laid down the tracks...but by the time it was mastered whatever soul these tunes had was mowed down to a pulp.  Being the tone fiend Gibbons is I am surprised he let this go sounding like it does.  \\"Over You\\" is one of the songs that reminds me of the soulful playing and song writing they are capable of...maybe it's just because its the first tune to give your ears a break from the razor blades coming out of the speakers.     Any ZZ Top album is full of great guitar by Billy Gibbons, on that alone this is worth a buy if thats your thing, the guy stands alone on what he does and how well he does it.  But I cant get past the terrible production and overboosted volume of the recording, I'll bet vinyl doesnt even make this sound good.  My collection of albums ruined by terrible production continues to grow...    Edit:  Great site to confirm the terrible production,  but there is hope..seems there are better versions  http://dr.loudness-war.info/album/list?artist=zz+top&album=la+futura
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I pick it up and put it down only to find myself picking it up again! it's addictive. You'll find yourself saying, &quot;just one more!&quot;
B007D2XSW0|5.0|PicShop is fantastic. The interface and quality are perfect for mobile. I think my favorite parts are the &quot;save as&quot; quality options, and the devs' communication. They ask for in-app feedback from users, and the language used throughout the app is simple, forthright, and friendly.
B000GRUNN6|5.0|One of the best speed metal records of all time hard driven sound, thrilling vocals the fastest forty minutes ever!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I don't get it.  Simple game I used to hate as a kid for stealing all my tokens at Chuck E. Cheese is still incredibly addicting without the silly ticket reward system.  End up coming back to this game for 5 min daily for no explicable reason...
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This was a fantastic story.  Pure, non-stop entertainment and David Mitchell has such an incredible grasp of giving texture to his characters and settings that he makes you feel it is happening as you read.  As you move from past to present to future and back again, the story unwinds into an ending that is somewhat expected but still moving.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading more of this author's books.  His abilities to weave a story and write using such graceful prose has me hooked.  Well done David Mitchell.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Hardcore rock with good singing, sold guitar solos, and a bit of new age mixing. It's good to hear real passion in music again.
0307454568|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is among my favorite characters in the books I've read. Despite (and sometimes because of) her \\"couldn't care less about you\\" attitude and her free use of violence, it's still easy to sympathize with her and root for her. She's been a victim of many horrible acts throughout her life and this book brings them all to light and tries to bring some closure. It has many of the characters you loved (and hated) from the previous novels and brings it all together. While having the same characters makes the book feel similar to the others, the main plot is different enough to make it distinctive. The ending was very satisfying and fitting; however, I couldn't help but want more and feel sorry Larsson isn't around to enjoy the popularity of his work and to continue it. If anyone does finish the fourth book which he started I will definitely read it, though with somewhat reduced expectations.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" starts right where \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" left off. Since that book left with so many loose ends, it's good to see how they all get tied together instead of just getting a \\"Reader's Digest\\" summary version. Zalachenko is hospitalized but he still remains a threat, while Niedermann proves even more dangerous. The big story though is something only touched on previously - who are the people responsible for protecting Zalachenko and having Salander declared incompetent? Blomkvist's continuing quest to help Salander clear her name uncovers a conspiracy within the government. The group of conspirators continues to operate and they have no qualms about using any means necessary in the name of self-preservation. Again both Blomkvist and Salander share center stage in the story, though separate for the most part. Berger also returns with her own plot line, intersecting at times with the main story. The Vanger family is entirely absent this time.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first two books in this \\"Millennium\\" series, you will almost certainly enjoy this last entry. It's easy to get addicted to reading it and it's an easy read like his other novels. There is enough repetition of the main plot points from \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" done here to refresh one's memory, without being so much that it's boring. I'm not sure if it's enough to read this one without reading the previous novel, but regardless, each book is so well written I highly recommend reading the whole series in order.ou will almost certainly enjoy this last entry.

B0083SBJXS|4.0|Marvel's The Avengers 5/5 OK Now you know what I think about the movie and thats all you need to know.<br />Now for the blu-ray the picture and sound is good as expected.<br />The special features are a little dissaponitment.<br />The good:<br />Joss Wendon commentary, just him<br />Deleted scenes<br />Gag reel<br />music video, just one<br /><br />The bad:<br />featurettes 14 minutes of it.<br />Marvel one shot, I expected more form it.<br /><br />I haven't seen or know what the second screen is.

B005KJZDXK|4.0|I'll keep this short.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the band, this album is great. Deschanel's voice is great, M. Ward's guitar is very retro sounding which is fitting for the style of the album.<br /><br />If you're not a fan, well why are you buying the darn thing? You know you won't like it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a new Christmas album that is familiar, but different enough to warrant buying a new album, this is it. It will blend in very well to your Christmas playlist. It's nice and relaxing with being new and different while staying traditional.<br /><br />So there you go, if you don't like this group, don't buy it. If you want a new Christmas album, this is the best one I've heard in awhile.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  it's rare I see something twice in a theatre.  I was a bit annoyed at some of the scenes that were so obviously dumb.  i.e.<br />1) he crew wakes up and most have never met one another.  what?  of course they'd be tested and work together, train together etc.. before a billion mile trip.<br /><br />2) hey an alien snake on a desolated world with oddly breathable air.  I'm gonna pet it!<br /><br />3) we just landed, it's about to get dark, buuuuuuut we have time for one quick expedition into those unknown alien ruins!<br /><br />The first time I saw the movie, those three things really made me mad.  But The powerful theme of life, faith, and origins made up for it.  stunning visuals and the living engineers were really really cool. I realized that somehow, this movie had to move along and fit within a normal movie time frame.  If Scott didn't execute some people via terrible cliche horror movie decisions, then it would have taken a long time to get to the real point of the movie.  I will say that the snake scene was so completely awful that i really appreciated it on it's own merits.  sorry for any spoiler there, but you've never seen something go quite so wrong if you haven't seen that yet.<br /><br />enjoy it everyone.  for me, it was one of those rare movies with a common question but done in a way that kept me thinking about it for weeks.  many friends agreed.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|After reading Fifty Shades, I, too, was on the quest to find a book to fill the void I had post-fifty. When I read Bared To You I immediately fell in love/lust with Eva & Gideon. Their love/lust/obsession was kind of beautiful to me. I could relate to Eva in a way that I didn't think I could relate to any character in a book. However, I agree that in this book she was kind of all over the place. It was hard to keep up with her emotions and thoughts. One second she was dead-set on quitting and the next she was almost begging Gideon to stay despite all the reasons for them to stay apart. I liked the good parts in the book. The parts where I giggled and it was all lovey dovey. I don't know. I am kind of on the fence on book #2. I guess my expectations were way high for this book. Oh well, I will wait around for book 3 and see where the story leads us but a part of me kind of sees it going one of two ways. Eva ends up pregnant and they get married OR They both realize their love is just way too much and they break up or one of them dies. I want to say this is all easily predictable.
0425263908|3.0|There are a lot a copycat phrases and scenes from fifty shades.Biggest difference is verbage.I would rather not see author's words for male and female genitalia.One specific sex scene i found disturbing:at his parents house when gideons step brother walks in on them.You'll have to read the book to see what i'm talking about.<br />Another disturbing scene is when eva walks in on an orgy including her gay roommate.Anyway,there are disturbing things in real life so you have to accept it when given to you by the author.On a positive note,i'm curious enough to finish reading the rest of the series.

B0096DFBZQ|3.0|Game is pretty good, for a few minutes anyway. This is a demo version and bugs you about buying the full version after everything that you do, but that's tolerable.<br /><br />The music is very repetitive, so just turn your volume down now. Controls are simple, but pretty effective. I rather enjoyed it, but I don't think I'll buy the full version.
0345803485|5.0|I have read so many reviews on this trilogy and am so sick of hearing people complain of repetitive use of words o phrases! Newsflash:listen to how many times a day you use the same words or phrases.I,personally use some not so very nice words several times a day.This book is written from inside the mind of ana steele,a young unexperienced female.These are her thoughts and points of view.This is her feelings about christian and his beauty from her eyes.Of course they are not beautiful literary works of art.I think the book would lose some of its allure if the author tried to write works like shakespeare.The point of the book is simple and very basic:a great sexual adventure,finding unconditional love,and proving that Christian is worth unconditional love.Even if he is flawed.He evolved into a wonderful man.He grew emotionally as well as anastasia.This book couldnt have become a bestseller and loved by millions for being a bad read.The word vanilla definetely puts a smile on my face.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading Bared to you i started counting down the days till this book came out. Eva and Guideon's lives seem to be tormented by their demons, insecurities, and fear of giving complete trust. This book takes you through there emotional rollercoaster of a relationship. I found myself thinking she was crazy to still be madly in love and willing to do anything for him after his behavior. They kept hurting eachother and it made no sense to be together. By the end of the book i almost cried. It takes a great author to put that kind of raw, true emotion in the writing and making the reader feel what the characters are feeling. Syvia Day is exceptional. I can not wait to see how Eva and Guideon's story ends.
0061801313|5.0|These books were amazing to read.  I received them 2 days earlier then expected which was great!!  They came in perfect condition. I will definitly be ordering the rest of the series from amazon when i am finshed with these great 4 books!!! If you love mysteries or dramas i would definitly recommend this series.
0374214913|5.0|What is it that bibliophiles everywhere love to read about?  That's right; all things bookish!  Debut novelist Robin Sloan uses this insight to great effect in Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.  It's guaranteed to charm any just about any book lover.  As for me, I just want to quote from it at length.  There were so many delicious passages!<br /><br />The novel is told from the first-person perspective of 20-something San Franciscan Clay Jannon.  Laid off from his corporate design job and desperate for work, Clay takes the graveyard shift at this most unusual bookstore:<br /><br />\\"Penumbra sells used books, and they are in such uniformly excellent condition that they might as well be new.  He buys them during the day--you can only sell to the man with his name on the window--and he must be a tough customer.  He doesn't seem to pay much attention to bestseller lists.  His inventory is eclectic; there's no evidence of pattern or purpose other than, I suppose, his own personal taste.  So, no teenage wizards or vampire police here.  That's a shame, because this is exactly the kind of store that makes you want to buy a book about a teenage wizard.  This is the kind of store that makes you want to be a teenage wizard.\\"<br /><br />I totally know that store.  Penumbra's however, is quirkier than most.  For starters, they hardly ever sell any books.  But there's a bizarre collection of secret books that are not sold, but lent to a select clientele.  And Penumbra has very specific rules regarding these dealings.  Sloan's novel begins as Clay's quest to understand the mysteries of his new workplace, and it expands exponentially from there.  It involves a 500-year search for arcane knowledge, a series of trippy fantasy novels, and what Clay recons is a cult that \\"seems like it might have been designed specifically to prey on bookish old people--Scientology for scholarly seniors.\\"<br /><br />Despite the readerly trappings, this novel and the characters within are Silicon Valley savvy.  Well, some of them are; it's generational.  Clay's love interest, Kat, is employed by Google, and that company plays a significant role in the proceedings:<br /><br />\\"Kat gushes about Google's projects, all revealed to her now.  They are making a 3-D web browser.  They are making a car that drives itself.  They are making a sushi search engine--here she pokes a chopstick down at our dinner--to help people find fish that is sustainable and mercury-free. They are building a time machine.  They are developing a form of renewable energy that runs on hubris.\\"<br /><br />Elsewhere there is talk of e-readers.  When the bookstore's customers disappear, Clay wonders if they've all bought Kindles:  \\"I have one, and I use it most nights.  I always imagine the books staring and whispering, Traitor!--but come on, I have a lot of free first chapters to get through.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't picked up on this yet, the humor of this novel really tickled me.  It goes without saying that I loved the San Francisco setting.  (Says Mr. Penumbra, \\"This city of ours--it has taken me too long to realize it, but we are in the Venice of this world.  The Venice.\\"  Amen, brother!)  Yes, Clay and his friends seemed very, very young to me (When did I get this middle-aged?), but that didn't stop me from warming to the clever and quirky cast of characters that Sloan has created.<br /><br />I would think this book would appeal to Jasper Fforde fans.  Sloan's novel is not a fantasy, and is therefore somewhat more in keeping with reality as we know it, but still, his is a heightened and more literate reality.  In Sloan's world, you could walk into this bar:<br /><br />\\"There's a stack of books on the table and a metal cup with pointy pencils that smell fresh and sharp.  In the stack, there are copies of Moby-Dick, Ulysses, The Invisible Man--this is a bar for bibliophiles.\\"<br /><br />That's a world that I was oh-so-happy to spend time in!  I was, in fact, sorry to leave.  Mr. Sloan, I can't wait to see what you come up with next.'t wait to see what you come up with next.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I admit, I was skeptical that this backpack would meet my needs. I tried three products including a large backpack from Crumpler and the Kitchen Sink model from Oakley. I returned both of these more expensive backpacks (~$200) in favor of this one.<br /><br />I travel frequently for work, usually with a laptop, sometimes with two, an ipad, sometimes my kindle, work files, a book or two, basic toiletries, sometimes a change of clothes in case my luggage gets lost, a gazillion adapters and cables. All of my previous backpacks/laptop backs either are uncomfortable when fully loaded or because of their shape just don't hold that much stuff. Some also are essentially a few big compartments and when you're looking for things you have to sift through everything.<br /><br />What peaked my curiosity was the video from the vendor. Thule has an excellent reputation for vehicle carriers and bike racks, etc., and I found that interesting. The video showed how much stuff this deceptively small looking backpack can hold. I love the separate iPad sleeve that's built into this and I no longer carry a separate iPad or laptop sleeve, as the backpack just nestles them so nicely. The various compartments are very well laid out, I love the little cell phone/wallet/sunglasses hardshell case on the top for flights when I hate having all that stuff in my pockets or my sunglasses getting broken because I forgot to remove them.<br /><br />The \\"accessible\\" compartment (not sure how else to explain it) is also great. If going into NYC, as an example, I'll fold up a light rain jacket or windbreaker there and if I need it, I can just pull it out without opening the backpack. All the compartments are roomy and accessible with a ton of compartments, net pockets, zipped pockets, there's room for a camera, headphones in (and out of) cases, etc. It also looks conservative an stylish and I wear it with sport coat many times. The padding on the back is very functional and straps are also fully adjustable, so even fully loaded it is not uncomfortable.<br /><br />Thus far the best bag I have ever purchased and even replaced my previous favorite, the Crumpler backpack (which is amazingly comfortable, but the single pocket design that forces digging to the bottom and the curved \\"camelback\\" shape makes it less useful for fitting bulky rectangular items such as laptops, video game consoles, and even books).e, so even fully loaded it is not uncomfortable.<br /><br />Thus far the best bag I have ever purchased and even replaced my previous favorite, the Crumpler backpack (which is amazingly comfortable, but the single pocket design that forces digging to the bottom and the curved \\"camelback\\" shape makes it less useful for fitting bulky rectangular items such as laptops, video game consoles, and even books).

0375507256|5.0|1. General Opinion:<br /><br /> Brilliant. Genius. Grand. Three words to define one of the greatest fiction works I've read this year. Amazingly narrated, the author has a distinct capacity to weave his readers with eloquence and yet, deliver messages of sufficient sustenance. The story unfolds in a crescendo-decrescendo fashion 6 stories, of which all are interlinked by at least 1 thread; each story pertaining its own lexicon and mode of narrating, which is not only a wild-most-amusing feat to conquer, but also generates within one whole-book a series of adventures that are restlessly interwoven.<br /><br /> 2. Author's writing style:<br /><br /> This detail is perhaps what enthralled me the most from the novel, Cloud Atlas. Narrating 6 distinct stories is not easy, especially if you're threading them with less than 1 membranous filament; add to that feat the fact that each narrative has its own characteristic language, with it's own faults and pearls--as each story is narrated from a first-person's point of view and details are given in correspondence to each individual's capacity to see and appreciate the world. Each narrative has it's own set of exquisite words used throughout the work--splendid. This was, perhaps, what kept me turning page after page--I needed to see how the hell this author managed to weave such a novel, seamlessly. As a writer, I admire this particularity and congratulate the author on such a wonderful project. The undertaking must've been a laborious endeavor, yet very gratifying.<br /><br /> 3. Transcending message:<br /><br /> The piece is marvelous at exploiting the weaknesses of man and of his will to power. As David Mitchell mentioned it in some portion of his book, there's some quoting of Nietzsche as the piece progresses. Man's egocentricity is by far the most criticized point of this book. Mitchell gloriously and skillfully portrays how egocentrism deteriorates man and ultimately, fails him as he acts against his fellow mates to attain power, love, wealth, etc.<br /><br />I will quote how Mitchell wonderfully portrays man's demise through the search for power and lust for possession:<br /><br /> \\"The will to power, the backbone of human nature. The threat of violence, the fear of violence, or actual violence, is the instrument of this dreadful will. You can see the will to power in bedrooms, kitchens, factories, unions and the borders of states. Listen to this and remember it. The nation state is merely human nature inflated to monstrous proportions.\\"<br /><br /> Beautifully written. Powerfully expressed.<br /><br /> 4. In conclusion:<br /><br /> I cannot say much about the plot--it's so well cross-linked that it's impossible for me to tell you a summary of what goes on in this mind-bending story. As a writer, I have been both entertained and educated by Mitchell's creation, especially from the vast amount of vocabulary I have learnt and in his mind-blasting mode of creating metaphors.<br /><br /> 5. The Movie?<br /><br /> Oh, yes, I forgot to mention the movie is coming out soon and that's why I read the book so quickly. As I read it, I wasn't quite sure how this book would be put into one whole piece. It'll be a surprise to see how the directors/actors pull this one off!in power, love, wealth, etc.<br /><br />I will quote how Mitchell wonderfully portrays man's demise through the search for power and lust for possession:<br /><br /> \\"The will to power, the backbone of human nature.

As a writer, I have been both entertained and educated by Mitchell's creation, especially from the vast amount of vocabulary I have learnt and in his mind-blasting mode of creating metaphors.<br /><br /> 5. The Movie?<br /><br /> Oh, yes, I forgot to mention the movie is coming out soon and that's why I read the book so quickly. As I read it, I wasn't quite sure how this book would be put into one whole piece. It'll be a surprise to see how the directors/actors pull this one off!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read this book in one sitting. Pat Peoples is just such a great character as well as Tiffany. Their weird and seriously complex relationship drives the story and makes you want more. A great book to read, especially when there are so many talks of the movie receiving best picture awards.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This novel was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad I listened!  A fantastic read that makes you think about your own life afterwards.  A book about a boy who sets out on a journey to discover his treasure which is both tangible and mental. It's a quick read but provides so much for you to think about!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Totally outrageous characters, stories within stories, with sneaky and not so sneaky pokes now and then at historical personages. Highly recommend.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I was not one of the many people bowled over by SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE BUT I was by this one.  Absolutely beautiful film in both technical AND acting categories.  It really deserved a bigger audience and alot more recognition from Oscar!  and what David Fincher accomplished in bringing a very short story to the screen, deserved awards for writing and directing.  So glad that Criterion did the DVD with fantastic extras...can't wait to check out the Blu-Ray version.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|I watched this for the first time since I was a little kid. It brought back fun memories for me and my room mate. It was sad that I remembered the words to all the songs after all these years.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|In my 60+ years of being a film fan/buff, this stands as my favorite movie of all times...not necessarily the \\"best\\" film ever made; but I was moved by this as no other.  I'm even one of those folks who drove (from Philadelphia) to Iowa (twice) to spend several days at the field and visiting Dyersville.  Kevin Costner has never been better and there are outstanding performances by Amy Madigan, James Earl Jones, and Burt Lancaster's farewell performance...what a way to end a great career!  All Oscar-worthy.  Hesitated to buy the Blu-Ray but am glad I did.  An absolutely great and beloved fantasy about the father/son relationship and a great look back at the 60s.  The only other time I saw so many grown men crying in a theater was at last year's WAR HORSE.  Hankies are recommended for all...\\"Hey, Dad...you wanna have a catch?\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The reading plans from BlueletterBible.org are a really cool addition to this application. My family has been reading through the Bible this year.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book was very informative. Considering that it was a free book you can't beat it. Other people are charging for this information. I learned a lot of new things that I didn't know. I should have a kindle book up soon with the information that I learned.

B00846REIS|5.0|This book was a great find. It was a long the same lines as 50 and yet was not disappointing because it was different.  The ability of this writer to make you want to root for the couple no matter the odds is amazing.  Great Book, Great Find, Great Read...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just finish this morning at 2:23 am!<br />seriously such a great read I couldn't put it down..<br /><br />i feel a little unfaithful to E.L James right now;<br /> BUT hands down this story leaves my beloved Christian Grey in the dust<br /><br />Worth the 10 bucks<br /><br />PS. I still love you Christian
0316228532|5.0|The writing style is completely different from her past works - if I didn't know that JK Rowling wrote this, I would never guess she is the author.  Her range is impressive.  The characters are completely fleshed out, the language is strong but true, and the setting is so close to reality, as realistic as HP was fantastical.  I am reading The Goblet of Fire with my son, and to switch between the two books was interesting to say the least.  I am very pleased to have read this book and look forward to reading whatever else JKR decides to publish.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great fun, entertaining and addicting. I would recommend this game to other players. Love feeling the vibration, with big win!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Having read all of Follett's novels, and having been particularly impressed by his most recent Trilogy works, I can say that Winter of the World is his best yet.  He is able to bring great insight into major world events at a granular level while cleverly showing how intertwined we all are.  Now that he is approaching a contemporary timeline, he has begun including sexual minority characters without being patronizing or sensational.  I can't wait for the third novel in this series!  I believe that history will rate Follett as a master author.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Love Mitch Albom, love this book! Very thought provoking. One of the most creative writers.<br />There is a lot of spirituality in his writing.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I read the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy and was curious how the movie would be.  I find that books quite often don't translate well to movies (missing characters, story changed to fit time limit, etc.).  But this movie managed to do it fairly well without butchering the book author's vision.
1400052181|5.0|I loved this book!!  It was recommended to me by a friend.  It has a lot of local connections for me now that I live in Baltimore and use Hopkins as my hospital.  But more than that, I love the idea that one person, any person, can make a huge difference.  It was also one of those books that reminded me to be more than thankful for what I have, b/c there's a lot of people out there who have it worse, and things are better now than they were even 10 years ago.
6304806418|5.0|My best friend has looked for a copy of Evita for sometime and had been unable to find one.  As usual, Am azon had exactly what I needed!  My friend was THRILLED!  Not to mention, the movie is GREAT!
B001RCD2DW|4.0|had this for almost a year and must say its a journey with the phones. when i first get it, i love the clarity, mids and highs of the phone. coming from a grado 325i, the bass of the akg is really a far cry. as times go by, i start to pay more attention to the details and deep bass that the akg can geerate. the bass is actually deep, just lacks a bit of quantity. i listen to mostly jazzy music and find the bass good enough to go along w the mids and highs. at times when i just want bass, the audio tecnica m50 can do a better job.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app today ....its amazing.. I love minecraft , i play it on the xbox. This is great because when ever I go on road trips I can play it. Only con is that you have to be using the same wifi with a friend in order to connect. But besides that its a must get app if you love minecraft.
B007THA4FI|4.0|One can't escape knowing about J.K Rowling, her difficult background, her stupendous success with Harry Potter. I never read more than a few pages in one book from the series, which presented itself at my nephew's bedtime. I was unimpressed, it felt tedious, although I have enjoyed the movies.<br /><br />I'm also one of those Kindle readers who had raged against eBooks over the $9.99 price point. Over time I've adjusted to the rare $12.99. But after reading a couple of positive professional reviews and becoming immersed in the sample, I bit, even at the publisher's ridiculous price of $17.99 (as I write).<br /><br />Hard to say that \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" was a treat, because the story characters are so mean or dysfunctional or drab, their relationships and self-involvements are so warped, yet the atmosphere created by Rowling of Pagford, an otherwise charming English village, is so rich and layered that it was a wicked joy to read.<br /><br />The characters would have been cartoon-like if they were one-dimensional, but they weren't. The situations would have been comical, except these things do happen, people do act in these ways, these kinds of petty slights, spites and horrific tragedies do exist. And Rowling presented this bit of life, this point in time, brilliantly.<br /><br />One star off because there were so many characters that it took awhile to nail them all down, kind of distracting until I finally got to know them. (Jeez, I hope I never meet anyone like these characters!)
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This fast moving tale told by the young son of two bank robbers will not disappoint, especially for those readers who appreciate a writer who is able to make his characters come alive with well crafted prose.  My wife read it after I did and liked it.
B0035O66CO|5.0|It's impossible to compare this delightful \\"period\\"<br />Thirties-nostalgia movie to any other.<br />A young Peter Bogdanovich so far surpassed all contemporaries with this lovely, poignant movie.<br />The Script itself is outstanding, the choice of actors who brilliantly fit the georgraphy and the period. The haunting period references, \\"Fibber McGee\\", George and Gracie, Movies of the period, the lustful desk clerk identifying himself to Madeleine Khan as \\"The Sheik of Araby\\". Originally watched this with my Dad, my eleven-year-old daughter, long years ago.  Re-watched it with grand-children. It's still absolutely wonderful.  A prickly Parent-Child love story.
0756407125|3.0|It's ok, but is a huge let down compared with the first book (which I thought was excellent). There is so much useless filler in this book. Pages and pages of boring rubbish that add nothing to the story or the characters...almost like Rothfuss is getting paid by the word.  This book is at least twice as long as it needs to be.  There is no direction, no discernible story arc, just a bunch of stuff that happens for no apparent reason, and all described in painful detail.  Rothfuss needs a more ruthless or courageous editor.<br /><br />Also, there are key suspension of disbelief breaking plot issues. I mean, a society that doesn't understand that pregnancy is caused by sex?<br /><br />It was all the more disappointing because I really like the fantasy world Rothfuss has imagined, and I wish it could have been explored through a tighter story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Addicted to these characters and this plot. I was wrung out with emotions through the whole book. How can a tale capture my feelings so thoroughly? I read RiY in bed, at work, in the car  (traffic was stopped...mostly!). I will read anything by this author!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is a superbly written epic. It is well paced and the way in which the story is told is both refreshing and engaging. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of epic fantasy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addictive,  but I wish there was a way to get more coins quicker.  I don't want to buy coins to play a free game.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really loved this game.  So sad I competed it.  It was a good length game,  not too short. I can't wait for the 2nd one to come out. Totally worth the money.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|i always wondered how much battery power i had when i used my kindle fire. this app is great!! Now i can see how much battery power i have left.  Great app!!!
B00948Q1NY|5.0|After reading this book, I'm a firm believer that through your subconscious mind you can obtain ANYTHING your heart desires.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud. It was beautifully written and this will be one of the few books I want to read over and over again. Well done!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|You may love it, you may hate it. This book either exceeds your expectations or doesn't. For me, I LOVED every word of it. It was better than the first book (I loved Bared To You as well) and a lot darker. The relationship between Eva and Gideon is soooo intense in so many ways it's ridiculous. It drove me crazy left and right, but they had their moments of being quite the interesting, complicated couple. I fell in love with them since the first book and my feelings haven't changed in this book. There were twists and turns and I kept wondering, \\"what is he/she thinking?!\\" It took me a few days longer to finish the book because I had to keep stopping and take care of household chores, but I took my time since I didn't want to rush it. Sylvia Day's Crossfire trilogy is definitely not boring; I'll be re-reading the first and second book all over again. I can't wait until the next book is out. This second book rocked, the drama was crazy, the dialogue kept me interested and the sex was smoking HOT!!!!! So again, you may love it, you may hate it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about this book, but I truly enjoyed it. Definitely better than FSoG (even if both series have their similarities, Sylvia is a better writer, much preferable). Overall, fantastic book!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Cant beat free.  Does drag out a bit toward higher levels but still a great game.  The download is kind of big but not a problem.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|When I bought my Samsung Exhibit II 4G smartphone here on Amazon, I was expecting an \\"el-cheapo\\" because of the low price. I certainly did not expect to have the vast array of apps that are available for it either. Well, the phone is no el-cheapo, but that's another review, but one app that I highly recommend is The Flashlight HD LED. I guess I never realized how handy this powerful little light could be. Trust me, if your phone does not already have a flashlight, this is a must have....and it's free!<br /><br />Rick Ghent
B003QOCTOM|1.0|The first episode was about a 4 out of 10 for me and then went down in subsequent episodes. I watched the whole first season since I paid for it and thought there mught be a good payoff in the end but unforunately this was not the case. The storylines become so dramatic and silly. The 16 year olds seem to be more intelligent than the adults. The storylines of a mysterious stalker are not addressed by the police and it is never clear why the girls feel they need to be so secretive. The target audience of this show is probably 14-16 year old girls but it is not appropriate for this age group- for example one of the girls is dating her teacher while one of the girl's mother feels she need to sleep with a cop in exchange for helping her daughter, drama for drama's sake. Disapointing as there is real potential. It remionded me a bit of a teanage depersate housewives at first.
B008CLI4N4|2.0|I loved the books and when I found out they made a TV show about it, I was really excited.<br />I gave it 2 stars, because they stuck pretty close to the book, but the acting was pretty cheesey. And in every episode there was a porn scene.  I have never seen so much of it in an HBO show.  I mean there are the Sopranos and Rescue Me.  Those were two of my fav HBO shows.  they have nudity and some sex.  But it wasnt like Game of Thrones.  In this movie I sware it looks like they are actually having sex.  And for a long time too.  There was one episode that made me feel so uncomfortable I had to shut it off because i kept looking over my shoulders in case my kids woke up.  Sheesh.  it was full girl on girl action. FOR LIKE 10 MINS! I have seen alot of shows/movies with blood and gore, and this one was no expection.  It turned my stomach. The fight scenes where very graphic.  So I bet this show was made for men only.  they got graphic war and loads of porn.  I will not be buying the other seasons.  I think it takes away from the show.  there is no need to add so much sex in every episode.<br />But please read the books, they are fantastic!
B00007KGCW|1.0|When I ordered this DVD originally, it did not have all the 'warnings' that it was not compatible with U.S. DVD players.  I have been trying to get a refund through Amazon and haven't succeeded yet.  My daughter also purchased this exact same DVD and she agreed that it didn't have the remarks about not being compatible with US DVD players.  I am still pursueing a refund.  Also the shipment took weeks to get to me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I color code birthdays spots etc.  its less thinking and fixing typos ...just jot and go.  I love the calender format as well
B000CCLE8I|1.0|I ordered this DVD for my grandchild and when it arrived, it would not play on my DVD - it's from a different region of the wolrd.  Buyer beware.  And when I went to find it in my orders to report it to Amazon, it wasn't even listed in my order!
B00013RC66|4.0|I had to borrow a line from the movie to put in the above title. In full, it went like this: \\"A complex series of seductions and murders, that's not something you see a woman do,\\" says the boss of Alex Barnes. How wrong was he? Not only was he wrong, but quite sexist. Women have been seducing and murdering men for centuries, and by the late 1980s I'm sure it would have been realized that a woman was more than capable of doing that sort of crime.<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot. That has been done elsewhere. What I will say is I loved the storyline and the script. Having two female protagonists duel with one another was a fantastic twist that one rarely saw in the 1980s, to say nothing of today. But 25 years later, this movie still enthralls me. I remember seeing it as a little boy when it was in theatres, and let me tell you it mesmerised me. I also loved the locations--like the now defunct parking lot (Site Of The Reagan Building Today) that was prominently used in the movie Manhunter the previous year.<br /><br />Despite being 25 years old, Black Widow holds up very well. This movie could be remade today and not lose a beat. There are a few plot holes I'll bring up. Was Barnes' scuba tank sabotaged by Catherine? This was never explained after her near fatal drowning. What was Catherine's real name? Who was she? Where did she originate from? Why did she allow Barnes to stick around when she began to suspect her being a federal agent? Why didn't she stop her killings after William McCrory in Seattle? She had more than enough money, and there was no indication in the movie that she was a sociopath so much as her killings were for greed. Indeed, she even cries herself to sleep after the first of her husbands (On Screen) dies, which shows some guilt on her part. How many others had she killed before the events of the movie take place? Could there have been other killings or was her first murder the one shown to us at the beginning of the movie? It would have helpedand added more detail had some or all of these questions been answered for the viewers.<br /><br />Leonard Maltin said there was no payoff at the end of the film. Well, to me the payoff was somewhat faulty and contrived. Why would Catherine have admitted to the attempted murder? Also, would she not have attempted to see the \\"body\\" of her husband before attempting to claim his money? I mean there was plenty of time and one would have expected her to wait until at least after the funeral before going after poor Paul's money. Yet she does not even attempt to see Paul's body. That to me was/is the biggest flaw in this movie's plot. Despite this, I'm giving it Four Stars.<br /><br />I only wish they would make more movies like this for women.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B0038AUY96|3.0|Whip out the checklist of police thrillers and you'll find all the pieces in place:<br /><br />- Troubled (semi)rogue detective with drinking problem<br />- Tight web of connections that reveals the killer is closer than anyone imagined<br />- Post-Da Vinci Code killer appropriately diseased or disfigured<br />- Strange killing rituals predicate on psychological trauma and mental illness<br />- Rising tension as the stakes grow<br />- (Predictable) red herrings (that we can identify based on pages left in the book)<br />- Implausible/inconsistent denouement (spoiler alert: why didn't he just cut the power?)<br /><br />So not the best of thrillers. But it held my attention until the end.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Usually when you watch a kung fu movie (especially those made in China), a lot of them have overly exaggerated fighting sequences, hilariously obnoxious sound effects, horrible dubbing, and terrible overracting -this movie has none of that. First thing to address is Ip Man himself. Ip Man and his students are responsible for training the critically acclaimed martial artist, Bruce Lee. Many of his students not named Bruce Lee have become regionally recognized as outstanding martial artists and have gone to teach others. This shows also the heart of where Bruce got his martial arts understanding. Ip Chun (the son of Ip Man) and Bruce Lee have both expressed that Ip Man taught that there is no best martial art, only the best martial artist. Wing Chun is one of the most popular styles of southern kung fu thanks a lot to Ip Man and his students *wink* *wink*. Donnie Yen does a good job portraying the Kung Fu master and the art of Wing Chun in general. Even though Wing Chun isn't his background, he did a lot of work with Ip Chun and portrays many aspect of the Su Lim Tao, chi sao, and bo gerk accurately. Plus Donnie's acting in general is very good.<br /><br />Next, The fight scenes are made to be highly realistic and high paced while capable of keeping you in suspense. The fight with 10 black belts is one of the best martial arts scenes in contemporary film. I won't spoil everything, but even though it is a choreographed fight, it doesn't bore you with the overdramatic nature of most martial arts films.<br /><br />Lastly, the plot is extremely cohesive and engaging. Like I said before, this probably has some of the best acting performances out of any other martial arts films that I've seen: as a standalone film, its very entertaining on its own. It is historically accurate to a degree, though there are many embellishments to the story to fit the film genre. It has great pacing and you don't feel like its setting you up for the next fight scene. Go watch it now - its worthy of all the accolades its received and belongs to every film library.
8361421475|5.0|I would highly recommend this book for Storch enthusiasts.  The 176 page book contains a pull out 3-view in the various popular plastic modeling scales, numerous color renderings of various schemes, both period B&W and color photographs of existing aircraft and line drawings and close up photographs of various details on the aircraft.  The cockpit shots are worth the price alone as many are of very nicely and accurately restored aircraft and the shots themselves are of rarely seen, hard to get details.  There is even a page devoted to the MG-15, the Storch's wartime armament.  Just be careful to weed out modern avionics and equipment in the color photos if you are building a period correct model.  The book contains information on all the significant Storch variants, including equipment specific to these and even has a page and photographs of Fieseler's later Fi-256, a rarely acknowledged aircraft.  Although published in 2012 in Poland, it is written in clear and correct English throughout.  As you might have guessed, I am a student of the Storch and have most of what has been published previously on the aircraft.  This work is right up there with the top 1-2 publications that I already have.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The final book of the Hunger Games series is rather disappointing, but still gives a final closure to the story.  It is repetitive and grasping at straws to fill the pages to the conclusion.  The conclusion itself was unsatisfying for anyone looking for a happy ending, or even an interesting ending: but perhaps it is a more real ending than the Disney like endings one is used to in this kind of book.  I think that if the Catching Fire and Mockingjay were combined into a single book with tight editing and compressing the story line it would have made the series stronger.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Anything you want to know about this novel you can get from reading Twilight - minus the mythological creatures, add sadism. Seriously, all the characters are the same - Bella = Ana, the awkward girl who is strong deep down inside (and an annoying narrator); Edward = Christian, the tortured soul who doesn't believe he deserves love; and all the other secondary characters in Fifty Shades can be matched with their corresponding characters in Twilight. Same goes for the remaining novels in the series.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|These are ver good movies. (Except for Episode II, which happens to be unusually horrible) There are three extra bonus discs that have very interesting documentaries and deleted scenes and interviews. The package has nice art too. There are even more changes, but the picture quality is good and I'd rather watch these than a VHS tape.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is incredible!  Hugh Howey has a gift with creating such a vast, claustrophobic and detailed world in the Underground Silo that the survivors of the end of the world live in.<br /><br />im not good at writing reviews much but seriously,  read this book,  especially if you are a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre and are open to non-cliche'd story lines!  5/5 !! cant wait for more Wool
0316044695|5.0|Wow, the stuff these brave men went through to protect our country is crazy. And just because they chose not to kill a few unarmed men because the media here would crucify them, they went through hell because of being good men. Anyway if I had a chance to shake these guys hands or get there autograph I would do it over any famous athlete or actor in history. In my next life I want to be one of them, I am 43 which make me to old but because of this book when I find myself in a hard situation in life or pain I think about them and make it through. Thank you seal team 10.
B008I34YYY|1.0|Wow, this rates in the C range.  Not even a B movie in my opinion.  Nazis hiding on the moon finally decide to come home and take over?  The box cover was the best thing going here.
0743270754|4.0|Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln is a solid, well-made book. It shows the deeper aspect of both Lincoln's political and non-political life, but it isn't all standard praise to Lincoln the whole way through. This book has more serious writing compared to other Lincoln books. It is long, but don't complain because it took Doris Goodwin 10 years to get all of the diaries, documents, and other items of Abraham Lincoln to write and then publish this book. So, all in all, it is a lengthy, but wonderful book on the political life of president Lincoln.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book absolutely grabbed me from the first page, and I can't wait to read the others in the series. Suzanne Collins has produced a truly exciting story that is all too familiar in human history. She has terrific characterization and vivid descriptions that make the action very believable, and her fight scenes are so ferocious that it seems hard to believe a lady wrote them.<br />I appreciated her lack of gratuitous sex, and unnecessary bad language.<br />I have begun the second book called \\"Catching Fire\\", and it is just as good. I already bought the final book, and look forward to finding the conclusion to a well told story about human search for justice.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|We loved it,hilarious,endearing,Danny Kaye was such an amazing performer, quite extraordinary how he was able to speak & sing his way through difficult complicated words so fast!! He has always been a huge favourite of ours, so now we hope to collect all his films if possible! Our favourite ones are 'The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty', & 'Hans Christian Andersen', which we have ordered & received, so we can't wait to watch it!<br />We received it on time, very pleased with the picture & sound, so thank you very much for the efficient postage & packaging.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|An intelligent SCI-FI extravaganza with heart. Sleepless nights await readers who pick up this page turner that pays homage to the decadent decade that was the 80's. You'll find yourself rooting for a protagonist that must overcome seemingly insurmountable odds in both the real dystopian world and the virtual world known as the OASIS. Think you know your 80's lore. Your meddle will be tested within these pages. And just as the populace portrayed in READY PLAYER ONE turns to the utopia of the OASIS to escape their bleak existence, readers will immerse themselves within a novel that will transport them from the mundania that is everyday life to the magical one created by Mr. Cline. Pure escapism that only a great novel can provide.

B008V4H6N6|5.0|Not that he had much growing to do, but this CD is a step up from Cosmogramma. Hopefully you're buying it now. I listened to it via NPR's 'First Listen', then ended up listening to it another few times before writing this. People say albums are 'growers'. In this case, it isn't really that the album's growing, but that you need to be able to understand what the album's doing. It's kind of a rush of sound.<br />Unlike Cosmogramma, Until the Quiet Comes doesn't tend to show off. The beats are fairly minimalistic - there are multiple things going on but if you want you can pick each individual beat or groove out easily. It gives the beats air to grow in, like planting a flower and watching it bloom because there aren't any leaves blocking its light.<br />Until the Quiet Comes is best when you listen to it straight through. I liked Cosmogramma specifically because I would put it on and not hear most of it - I would be doing something while listening to it and would occasionally tune it out. But at the end of the CD I always felt better, somehow. I would notice it was off not by the absence of sound, but by the bad mood that came with its absence.<br />I smiled after this CD was finished. I'd been lulled into not analyzing certain parts - I think that's by design. The high points are very high, and the low points don't exist.<br />If you like electronica or whichever of the many genres FlyLo fits into, you should pick up this album. He's the only artist, at this point, whi's gotten to the point where I instantly buy his CD's.<br />I'd say my favorite tracks, in order of appearance on the album, are All In, Getting There, All The Secrets, Putty Boy Strut [the video is also fantastic], Hunger [the section after 2:22], me Yesterday//Corded, and Dream to Me.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is so great. Very emotional @ some points, but funny at others. Sylvia Day did another great job with this book & I can't wait for December 31st to get here.
B0009WFDR4|5.0|Anyone who love's music from this era this is an essential CD in for your collection.<br />Steve Marriott's voice is nothing but pure gold and the band is in top form. Had they<br />taken this on the road ,history would have been changed. It is a CD you will find<br />yourself listening to frequently. 10 STARS PLUS!
0316228532|5.0|I thought this was a fabulous story! VERY well written, not a word wasted. JKR has a very sharp perception on human behaviour & it's in full force here. Her writing reminds me of a less twisted & dark Roald Dahl. Highly recommend for those who appreciate great writing.

B0088TG252|5.0|Hey! It's Denzel. What more can I say. This guy is awesome in anything he does. This was a great action movie ala Bourne trilogy. Looking forward to the sequel, because you know there will be one after the ending setup.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is really great for seniors with bad eye sight. The Numbers are big and you can see everything that you are doing. I really like the Back-up key and the tally page.
1423140605|4.0|After I read [[ASIN:1423140575 The Serpent's Shadow]], I was disappointed. It wasn't as good as I'd hoped, and it definitely wasn't worth waiting months for. So I was preparing myself for a little disappointment in The Mark of Athena, having waited a whole YEAR for it. But I wasn't disappointed! The Mark of Athena is absolutely amazing! All my months of waiting were worth it.<br /><br />Now I won't give away any spoilers because I wouldn't want to read any, but the Percy/Annabeth reunion was really funny, which I actually liked better than a sappy romance part. Their other moments are sweet and hilarious (ha ha, Mr. Sneaky Jackson!).<br /><br />The Greeks and Romans fought, but the Seven didn't; Jason and Percy were a bit stiff around each other when it came to leadership, but then they were like, \\"Seriously, dude?\\" Leo and Frank fought. Can you guess who they were fighting over?? But even they warmed up to each other at the end.<br /><br />All the point of views were done splendidly, and I'm so glad Rick Riordan picked who he picked! . . . Except for Piper. Her chapters were pretty much worthless, just thinking about her and Jason's relationship. I really wish Jason or Hazel had had Piper's point of view. I hope they'll be in the next book, The House of Hades.<br /><br />The book was mainly focused around Annabeth, which I really liked; and this book makes you like her even MORE when you've read it. She and Leo really tell the story, and the other characters are just there. Even Percy seems like a filler, though I enjoyed his POVs.<br /><br />I really loved all the Leo/Hazel moments. (I'm Team Leo!) Leo/Sammy was explained well, and when Leo and Hazel came back from the flashback it was so sad and sweet.<br /><br />I hadn't realized how much I missed Leo until I came back to him, and I'm sooooooo glad Rick Riordan gave him a point of view. He is so funny, and such a perfect character. I think I might like him better than any of the Seven, even Percy.<br /><br />I only have one dislike: the cover. Of course I'd seen it before I bought the book, on the computer, and it actually looks better onscreen. The printing made it darker, and a little grainy. But that's not so much it. I didn't like the cover PICTURE. Because it led you to assume Jason and Percy fought, which they didn't really. And that was just a tiny part in the book. The cover really should have showed Annabeth, on the Argo II, or in Arachne's lair.<br /><br />The ending was really great . . . but not when you have the wait a whole YEAR for the next book! The cliffhanger was horrible! (I would've said \\"rickhanger,\\" but it really was a cliffhanger.) I'm doing a little Nemesis revenge here, cutting back a star, 'cause I'm mad at Rick for keeping me in suspense.<br /><br />Overall, it was an absolutely wonderful book, totally worth $11, a year to wait for . . . and probably worth five stars.nly have one dislike: the cover.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game it was a little complicated in the beginning but once you figure out how it works its pretty eeasy to work
B002VWNID6|1.0|The disc is a two sided movie. You have to flip it over to watch the other half of the movie. Ridiculous!! No where on the product description does it say this! Don't buy this version of the movie, it sucks!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|When closed it is still running in the background, and uses an insane amount of processor and battery power. More than the operating system. An obvious sign of tracking and research software. Harmless or malware, still not worth the mild entertainment.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Definitely recommend for any woman wanting a good read that will keep her attention throughout the entire book. Very good ending to the trilogy.
B0012CH350|4.0|This fits well and appears to be sturdy. It goes on and off easily. I live in a cold weather state and have only been using it for a few weeks, so hopefully it will last in the snow for a long time.
B00407PNY2|4.0|This is a must have foundation of thoses who grew up in the late '60's.  I personally have a connection to this dvd since I graduated from HS in 1968 when this move originally was released;  I had a 1965 Fast Back Mustang 2+2 at the time;  I currently own the 40th Anniversary \\"Bullitt\\" Mustang; and it is the most famous car chase scene in film history!  Steve McQueen rocks!
0439023513|1.0|I have to agree with the other one star reviewers.  The first two books were so riveting and well written and I loved them.  However, this book was simply awful.  I hated practically every minute of reading it, but I had to finish  to see what happened at the end of it all.  The characters lacked the depth and personality of the first two books.  Collins seemed lost when writing this.  Several times I found myself saying, Katniss would not say that or do that.  The characters were like cardboard cutouts of themselves.  The story was not developed well at all.  Because it was so disjointed and the character development so bad, which was so different from the first two books, it felt like it was written by a different author who totally didn't understand the characters and was just trying to emulate Collins but fell way short.  The way it ended was not even remotely believable.  Prim would have never been at the front line of the rebel attack acting as a medic.  She was 14.  Ridiculous.  I know Collins was using that trying to stoke Katniss' hatred for Coin, but it was too farfetched and contrived.  And the quick fairytale wrap up was abrupt and out of place with the rest of the book.  This third book was so disappointing.
0525953728|5.0|I found the book quite informative and written in the style of how special operators I've known would have written it. The first part about the training was heartwarming to me as it brought back so many similar, familiar thoughts and emotions. I enjoyed reading a member of a younger generation's thoughts about wanting to serve with the best in perhaps the most difficult profession and then persevering through whatever it took mentally, physically and psychologically to succeed. The authors knew the readership would be from many sectors of many societies and cultures making the background information of what a man must endure to be chosen to be in a place like the door of Osama Bin Laden's bedroom in the dark of night.<br /><br />I was humbled by the candidness of this SEAL who spoke of his fears and how he handled them. He spoke of his family and loved ones back home warmly. He was honest about his tiredness and how he had learned to set aside even thoughts of being comfortable so as not to take his full focus off the tasks before him. Reading this book may bring many surprises to a great deal of the public who rely on the two weakest links in obtaining news and seeing characterizations formed of people in special operations. Those weak links are the \\"the mass media\\" in broadcast or print; and \\"Movies/documentaries\\" from Hollywood. The SEAL reminded me that the bravado and chest thumping we often see when the news seeks out a \\"former (fill in the blank) military member\\", but does little to verify the credentials or relevence of experience of the guest. Occasionally, they will get the right person, but then the interviewer usually asks the wrong questions and keeps steering the interview toward the agenda of the station/network. I say this about all broadcast and print media available in this language without singling out any political view. Journalists could take a lesson from this SEAL about finding the unvarnished truth in a story. He does mention some personal political views, but it is an auto-biography that is often less political than most broadcast/print news. The SEAL lacks the subtlety employed by the mass media, but special operators get little training in subtlety wheras it seems journalists get a lot.<br /><br />I hope everyone will read this book to help them understand why people choose to undergo such training and then subject themselves to the danger of carrying out the orders of the elected officials who decide what needs to be done and the elected officials who vote the funds necessary to carry out the missions. The special operators are not the ones who decide what is in their nation's best interest. The only thing a military member can decide is if the order issued to them is a legal order and be ready to undergo the review to determine if the order had been legal and to then be ready to face the consequences of disobeying a legal order. The higher up the chain of command, the more review of legality of the order has been done. If you know the Commander in Chief is listening for reports on the mission, you can feel safe knowing the order is legal. A disparaging reviewer mentioned morality. Anyone who may have morality issues with being involved in combat may declare themself a conscientious objector and still serve in most nation's military forces in non-combat duties.<br /><br />Being married to another retired military officer, I was most happy to see the involvement of women included in this operation. Though women were not a part of the boots on the ground operation, there were countless women involved, both civilian and military. My military career ended after women were in nearly every facet of special operations, with the exception of ground operations. I am sure there are women who may want to be a part of these operations, but the women I knew, who were all tough soldiers, told me when I often asked if they would like to trade places with me, that there was no way they wanted to try that. Many missions are not physically as demanding as others, but every team member must be able and ready to go anywhere and do anything as the SEAL pointed out.<br /><br />The SEAL used a time line to show how the story unfolded in the press, knowing the next breaking news may show his face and the specfic area of his hometown was mentioned and crawling with newspeople. I applaud his hesitation to sign a memento, but wonder why he did not express reluctance about the team photo. I have seen the photo, with the only face not covered being that of Cairo, the military dog. I am aware some official military photos from my days of film had the negative altered in the darkroom to prevent seeing faces, name tags, even rank, branch and class rings where camouflaged. I don't know how that is handled in the digital age.<br /><br />I read the book and I read the very few disparaging reviews posted here. As a retired special operator, I can offer the unhappy reviewers a bit of advice. If you see an autobiography by someone whose life was not one of letters, but one of action, please hold your criticism for the lack of scholarly prose, and the lack of the author's review of historical significance. Attempts to diagnose the mental capacities of these men who find humor where they can is petty. Sophisticated humor has not been a hallmark of soldiers throughout history, as they live under the very great stress of knowing the next funeral they attend may be their own. I suggest you treat such auto-biographies as you would an historical account of an eyewitness. Try to focus on putting yourself in the situations described and attempt to imagine your emotions. Adrenaline, yes; but to describe it as being drunk on it is ridiculous. These professionals must perform to perfection and make split second decisions upon which their lives and the lives of their team mates depend. Feel safe in your crystal clear hindsight and leather recliner, while rough men go about the duties the voters in their respective countries put decision makers in office to decide and order these deeds done.<br /><br />I applaud the courage of this SEAL for bringing this book forward and for donating a significant amount of the proceeds to charities supporting the families of lost SEALs. I also applaud and thank the untold and often unknown service members of every free country. I feel a brotherhood of arms even with the unwilling soldiers forced into service of nations which are not free. Despots and their minor tyrants are on their own.

B004ZP37HE|4.0|This episode was pretty good I do have to admit that, yet I felt it was rather anticlimactic.  Events that we have been waiting to happen since the first season finally happen and it almost seemed like a secondary proceeding.  Could have used a two parter, really, to make this effective and to set you up for a cliff hanger ending that leaves you confused as to what just happened.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|This was part of a larger Birthday present for my daughter.  I actually ordered a Lego type DollHouse from MegaBlocks and was concerned if these would work together.  I figured if they didn't, it was ok since my daughter wanted some of the smaller legos anyway, she could use these separately.<br /><br />It arrived on time with my Prime shipping in well packed, excellent condition.  EXACTLY as pictured.<br /><br />As mentioned, these are the smaller lego bricks and they worked fine with the MegaBlock brand that also had smaller pieces.<br /><br />My daughter was pleased and I can tell she's happy when she is quiet and focused on her toys!

B004YM6JK0|4.0|\\"Supernatural\\" turned into the Little Engine That Could--the series appeared on a small network, had a small following initially and has blossomed into a cult hit. The first five seasons were terrific with a series of season long story arcs and a larger one that, had it ended with season five, would have made for a satisfying series (although some fans might not have been happy with Sam's fate originally).<br /><br />Season six which started with the return from Hell of Sam who was missing his soul  stumbled a bit as the series creator Eric Kripke left the show and the series searched for a new direction. The seventh season is more satisfying and more consistent than season six reaching close to the high points and their fight in the pit during seasons one through five.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Sam's looney tunes--he's lost his mind, or rather, his soul has been damaged from his possession by Satan in the pit. What's more Castiel in his battle with the other angels in Heaven for supremecy takes a dangerous path--making a deal with the Crowley. He's also absorbed the souls in Purgatory--the only problem is that he's also absorbed God's first creations--the Leviathans-- creatures that were so offensive to God that he banished them. At first Castiel BELIEVES he is now God but quickly discovers that he can't handle the souls of the Leviathans who escape and decide to make humanity into their version of Soylent Green. Dean, Sam and Bobby are the only ones who can stop them and, without Castiel, they quickly find themselves on the losing end of this battle.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray for \\"Supernatural\\" looks marvelous. Blacks are as rich and gooey as the blood of the Leviathans. Colors looks quite nice and the show which always looked like grainy  film even though it is shot digitally and detail remains strong throughout. The AVC encode helps each episode look top notch.<br /><br />The lossless audio sounds marvelous with nice directional effects used throughout the series.<br /><br />The special features are quite good as well. We get three commentary tracks including \\"Slash Fiction\\" with our stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles who are their usual charming, chatty, funny selves.<br /><br />We also get the \\"Supernatural Creature Fest Drive-In\\" which has a number of terrific featurettes covering how the writers came up with the story arc for the seventh season, \\"Highway to Death\\" that compares what one of our characters sees when they die (as compared to what we've heard and read about in literature), \\"Prosthetic Men\\" focuses on the make up/creature effects and \\"Trail of the Winchesters\\" tells us everything we did (and didn't) want to know about Osiris.<br /><br />We also get \\"Doppleganger's Ball\\", \\"Weekend at Lily Dale\\" which focuses on the episode \\"The Mentalists\\" and what inspired the episode. \\"Creatures from the Digital Realm\\" shows us how the creatures were created for the season.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I rarely ever give any app 5 stars but this one is well deserving! It's great all around; awesome puzzle/quest-like gameplay, beautiful and calming music, and it is truly soothing and relaxing to play...it doesn't make you feel stressed but keeps you still coming back for more. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it!

B008NW67E0|5.0|Way overdue, but most definitely worth the wait.  Their sound is so incredibly unique for this time, and you have to love that they take actual music into this -- not just lots of sounds mashed together, but different sounds meshed together to create something wonderful.  Exactly what I was expecting, pure Mumford & Sons.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This wasn't my favorite Reacher novel but still read it at a rapid pace.  Not sure how Jack's nose was broken.  Found parts a bit slow on the drives through the midwest.  Character development could have been better. Best Reacher read was Bad Luck & Trouble with other former crime fighting teammates.  Would love more books with them together again.  Kind of like Baldacci's The Camel Club.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was born in England and lived there for 28 years, this is the England I left and have seen during many visits to Derbyshire.<br />It is not an easy read as the many characters are well defined and it is necessary to know them to enjoy the read.<br />For me while reading, I can identify many of my casual school friends, family friends, do-gooders, and snobs. It certainly isn't pleasant to read as we face people and situations we know from life and that is uncomfortable.<br /><br />But it should not be a reason to not read the book.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Such a cute movie, and our daughter loves it! Definitely fun for our whole family! I highly recommend this movie
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book of three. An exciting adventure of a young girl through tragic circumstance and how she manages to get through with the help of others.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Really enjoyed the game. It was too easy to find myself playing it for several hours at a time. It is a very addictive game. I loved it. Now I'll try their other games
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last book in the series of three. You will never get the ending unless you read the book. If you have read the last two this is a must.
B004YTGRMI|2.0|I just had to chime in: I cannot believe the reviewer who said this was a great remaster - he has been completely suckered by the volume wars madness that the record industry is using on all these re-releases. Turns out this remaster is very very loud and ends up severely compressing the music    It sounds much louder but if you take the original CD and turn up the volume on your amp to comparable levels you will notice something painfully obvious - the original CD has dynamic range, the remaster does not.    I don't know if these links will work but it is painfully obvious to the ears and eyes when you see this    [...]    I still *do* think this set is worth owning. It is REM's best in my opinion (and I don't say that lightly as they have so many great albums) and the bonus material alone makes it completely worthwhile. I wish they would include a remastered and an uncompressed version - they have so many multiset editions these days. I mean honestly, how much would it cost them to put another CD in the box uncompressed. Like 25 cents???
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book of three. Thought it would be the same as the first. Lots more characters, graphically descriptive. Although its a continuation from the first book it's is another excellent book in its own right.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have read the majority of his books, but this one was all over the place.  It didn't make sense in the beginning and I thought it would improve but it only got worse.  There were no redeeming qualities.  Sorry I like Lee Child but this book failed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A must read! Couldn't put the book down! Keeps you sucked in until the very end. Gone Girl is a great book for anyone looking for a little suspense.
B002R9QKJW|5.0|The Supernatural episodes are mostly spellbinding and well and truly filled with every eerie and awesome myth.  Also demons and angels, and the absence of God 'good' and presence of Lucifer 'evil' - and this episode in particular is so stunningly \\"the end\\" of everything we know as it is now, with Lucifer wonderfully handsome in white, arrogantly directing the deterioration of civilisation with an elegant foot on Dean's dishevelled head, in a hopeless, everything-less situation.  I think that this has been the most thought provoking and meaningful episode so far.
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|Doesn't matter how young or old you are this movie is very enjoyable. My 4 younger children (13, 11, 7and 4)wanted to watch it again and again. Took it to work and my co worker (mid 30's) loved it as well! I would highly recommend it as a family movie. One whom of all ages can enjoy!!

B001AQR3IU|5.0|Worth every cent!<br />For those of us who watched the movie when it was released, loved it, downloaded it or bought the DVD (just to watch it over and over) and then couldn't afford the HD-DVD, this is a must have. The quality of the DVD doesn't even nearly match the Blu-ray.<br />This movie is not for anyone though, watch it before buying it so you don't be surprised; this is no Hollywood-super-production, it has it's charisma for those who know how to apreciate it. Personally I like it a lot, so much that I even waited for the blu ray release to get it as my first movie in BR. I was on that pre-release list Amazon makes, I even considered buying the export release (which has even better artwort if you don't mind paying more than US$40).

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Not as great as Twilight or 50 Shades, but much better than the Fallen series.  Can't wait for the movie.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Great album start to finish. The production is spot on, kinda reminds me of what fat possum records has been doing with RL Burnside.  Billy's voice has aged to a sandpaper growl that oozes the blues.  There is even a hint of old AC/DC in the song flyin' high. I hope this is just the first of a series of albums with Rick Rubin. They found magic together. Of course it's a touch repetitive, it's the blues! Blues music is like a pot of stew, same basic ingredients, it's the personal spice you add that make's it yours.
B0083GCK5G|3.0|The Beach Boys sound almost exactly like they did decades ago. It's as if they're stuck in the past, not even aware that; with the relatively recent creation of the internet, iPods and such; old-fashioned AM-FM radio is a dying medium. But that's not at all a bad thing. The point of this album is to take rock and roll lovers on a trip down memory lane, where they'd cruise the streets in a recent creation now known as the classic car. The harmonies are nice, of course. Few groups do harmony as cohesively as The Beach Boys. The song concepts are fitting. Titles include words like Spring, Ocean and Coast. Brian Wilson's soundscape is classic. But these Boys have sang much better melodies in the past. As serene as these new songs may be, there isn't really a gem in the bunch. It's also debatable whether or not \\"God\\" actually invented the radio, as opposed to hard-working people who'd probably take umbrage with such a ridiculous claim.<br /><br />marcellee.com
034580404X|5.0|I believe I am one of the last people on the planet to finally read the set.<br />I enjoyed all 3 books, but Book 3 was my favorite.<br />The story line kept you wanting more...wondering what's around the next corner.<br />Makes you wonder if there really are Christian Grey's out there in this world?!?<br />Great love story, with some suspense, comedy, and of course raunchy details.
B008KW43TE|4.0|The TV theme, which offers ghostly interludes of what sounds like a person flicking thru channels, is unnecessary. It's subtle enough, but it serves as a minor distraction from what is otherwise an album of outstanding soul songs. They're designed around soft and often drum-dampened grooves, mostly slow and sensual in nature; rhythmic pulsations that drip, ooze and float around in space like daydreams of amour caught in a lava lamp. The only reason it's Pink Matter, as opposed to Orange, is because that particular ode, featuring Andre 3000 as the perfect guest rapper, happens to be dedicated to a girl.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is dedicated to a guy, which makes Frank Ocean either as bisexual as Janet Jackson was when she sang about loosening the back of a girl's \\"pretty French gown\\" and tying her up with Velvet Rope or as artistically daring. Either way, wherever his true romantic orientation lies, there's undeniable beauty in these songs. Frank Ocean is Stevie Wonder in the 1970s, which is nothing less than fantastic, but it's a style that wouldn't mean much if that's all he had to offer. Beyond all the gloss; even the song about Crack Rock sounds enticing enough to make love to; are hearty vocal melodies.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B005NQ5LSC|1.0|I had high hopes for this movies. I mean the first two about Ip Man were great... so I really expected this one to at least compare to those ones. But there is no climax... there's just pretty much the same tone throughout the whole thing.
B0080R7Q70|5.0|The Flower Kings seem to getting better with time, their last release and this one are very high quality works. This album is a little more laid back and less intense than its predecessor. However, all the color and lyricism which you associate with the FK, is very much present. The emphasis is on songwriting and lyrics rather than on instrumental complexity, but there are still plenty of progressive instrumental passages which make this a great progressive album.<br /><br />One thing you cannot help but notice is that the best material is selected, with no filler (you can get the extra bonus tracks on the special edition, but they are really nothing special, so you can save the money and get the single CD release). There are only 5 tracks, which is a good thing. They have not lost their whimsy and humor, although the album is more melancholy overall (lyrics and music both) than its predecessors. There is no hard rock or experimentalism, just great sounding symphonic rock with some echoes of the 60's and John Lennon.<br /><br />The darkly melodic 25-minute epic \\"Numbers\\" is built around the soulful song \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" (not to be confused with the classic CCR song), and \\"Raising the Imperial\\" (a haunting ballad included later in the album, almost a prayer set to music) which is reprised several times in various guises. It features two (only!) intricate instrumental progressive passages - one at the beginning and one before the slow coda section. Around the middle is a little ghostly, Tim Burton-esque keyboard solo. \\"Pandemonium\\" is a great Genesis-like prog track with its dark reciting voice reminiscent of Steve Hackett's Genesis Revisited. \\"For the Love of Gold\\" is another fantastic piece, with lots of symphonic prog distantly reminiscent of Yes. \\"For Those About To Drown\\" is a beautiful song with echoes of John Lennon and 60's art rock. It has a gorgeous baroque style guitar interlude and soulful guitar playing. Despite the references to classic sound of the 70's and 60's, the style of this album is more Flower Kings, and relies less on copying other progressive bands.<br /><br />The new drummer is a good change, his drumming is not as harsh as Szoltan Csorzs's and better suited to the changing dynamics and shifting moods of Flower Kings' music. The keyboards are kept in the background, providing lush symphonic textures or doubling up the guitar lines, except for a few solos here and there, and a few whimsical fills. The guitar dominates the album pretty much.<br /><br />Last but not least is the gorgeous cover illustration, which fits the album's mood perfectly.  This album is highly recommended for FK fans, prog rock fans, as well as classic rock fans.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|if you like any of the star trek series this is a good one to watch and own.it shows the begining of the enterprise and it's traveles into space.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I had been looking forward to reading this book since finishing \\"Fall of Giants\\" and I wasn't disappointed. The stories of the familes are gripping and the retelling of such a familiar period in history is done with sensitivity and insight. I can't wait to read the third book!
1594484775|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this funny, sad, romantic, and touching book.  I won't reiterate the plot -- many others have already done so quite well.  But I do want to urge others to read the book.  I hated to put it down each time I was reading it and was sorry when it ended because I was enjoying the reading experience so much.  Any book that draws me in that much gets my highest recommendation.<br /><br />As you've seen elsewhere, \\"Juliet, Naked\\" concerns a music fan, Duncan, who is either scholarly or obessive (maybe a lot of both) about a retired musician and his masterpiece, an album called \\"Juliet\\"; the fan's long-time girlfriend, Annie, who has regrets about their childless relationship and the lack of direction or passion in her life; and the musician himself, Tucker Crowe, who has regrets about his lack of a relationship with four of his five children and maybe about his lost musical career.  I'm a music fan, although not a narrowly obsessive one (my musical interests are too diverse), but I can relate to the passion that the love of music can create.  I'm also at the age where, though I have a generally happy life myself, I can understand how the no-longer-young characters all have regrets.  And I really like romantic comedy (mostly of the movie kind from the 1930s and 40s), and Hornby knows how to tell that kind of story in a way that is both convincingly romantic and funny.<br /><br />I don't want to commit the mistake of Duncan, the music fan, by over-praising \\"Juliet, Naked\\" -- in the book, he over-praises an album of the same name, a demo-recording version of the masterpiece album \\"Juliet.\\"  He gets too caught up in his enthusiasm for the first newly released music in two decades by his favorite musician, Tucker Crowe, praising it to the skies as superior to Crowe's masterwork, even though this \\"new\\" music consists of unfinished earlier versions of the same songs.  This opinion and its obsessive nature creates a final rift with Annie, Duncan's more down-to-earth partner, exposing the fault-lines in their relationship and leading to its end, and to more interesting developments in the story.  So I'm not going to say that \\"Juliet, Naked\\" -- the book -- is the best work of art ever created, which is essentially what Duncan says about the album of the same name.  It probably isn't, and I'm betting that Nick Hornby wouldn't say otherwise.  But it's certainly a book that's given me much more enjoyment than many of the books I've read (including many \\"great\\" books), and that's quite an accomplishment.  Putting aside somewhat useless comparisons about greatness, Hornby has created a real work of art by devising a world that I was able to live temporarily in by reading.  That's as much as any artist can do.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I wish I could hear Tucker Crowe's music, but there are other albums (Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" Brian Wilson's Beach Boy masterpiece of love \\"Pet Sounds,\\" to name two examples) that can stand in for it.  Hornby writes so well that he makes you want to hear music that doesn't actually exist.<br /><br />I'll try to avoid any spoilers about the story's ending, but let me just say that, despite the ambiguity, I think it's possible to figure out what Hornby envisioned for the characters.  Think about the last things he tells you about each of the main characters, and I think there's a good possibility that you'll figure it out.  (But maybe I'm just assuming that my inclination toward a happy ending is somehow realized...)<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great book.  Read it.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|not happy with the stock browser on mobile or tablet-i wasn't-and i downloaded this app and now my pages and browser are loading much better and faster.  stock browsers are not the best anyway. so if not happy with yours-i suggest to give this a try. made me lots happier with my tablet i know that.  plays my youtube and other videos much faster than stock browser ever did.<br /><br />you can import your bookmarks also as well as set up new ones and set home page as well to what you like.

B008C1O8CA|1.0|Have you ever been at a mall and see an old guy walking around that just curses all the time?  This is the album Uno.<br /><br />I'm a huge Green Day fan and found that every album they seemed to get more and more talented.  I liked that they still stuck to their punk roots but did it in a mostly classy way.<br /><br />This album is a train wreck.  8 of the 12 songs would have probably never been published if they were just making a single album.  For some reason they seem to think that if you have a bad song, maybe if you have the f-bomb in every lyric then it is still cutting edge.  This album is an embarrasment to their talent.  While past albums had some explicit language, this one is so laced with it, that you will be embarrased if any one overhears you playing it.<br /><br />The album has a perfect title because it rates an Uno.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was eye opening but very good.  I was a great read and totally immerses you into the characters and their world.  I was hooked early on and wanted to complete the series.  Don't think you can stop at one book or start anywhere but the beginnings because they are really one complete story instead of three.  It could have been one hugh book, in itself.  Great reading. Loved it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very addictive. The only downfall that I can see is the regeneration of coins while offline. Other than that great game.
B008OHV5QO|5.0|I recently rushed to a small inner city cinema in Melbourne to see the Saturday midday screening of \\"Neil Young Journeys\\". Joining me were five others - and we all joked about how we couldn't understand why the cinema wasn't full!!<br /><br />This movie is brilliant. We get to be with Neil as he rambles around \\"a town in north Ontario\\" and gain a glimpse into his younger days. We are right on stage as he takes us through song after memorable song from all stages of his career - oh the playing. Jonathon Demme's direction is superb - you are on a journey into the theatre and on to the stage.<br /><br />Neil plays with such power and passion - be warned about the impact of those first chords of \\"Ohio\\" - and also sweetness and respect for his subject matter.<br /><br />I've got to have this DVD

B002ZG97LK|5.0|I grew up watching the old Footloose (Kevin Bacon), and absolutely adore that movie. It's a classic, and it actually describes my childhood quite aptly. Despite my love for the original, I also happen to love this version as well. It's very similar, but the music is updated (and much more country), as are the clothes and dancing. It does not hurt that the two leads, Ariel and Ren, are beautiful and extremely charming/handsome (respectively). I own both versions, and I love both. You should give it a shot even if you're a diehard Bacon fan (just keep an open mind!).
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Loved , loved, loved  it.  Pines kept me glued and guessing with every word.  i love a good   mystery and pines is definitely a page turner,  leaving one hungry for more .

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I found The Piano Guys back when they only had two videos up on YouTube, and I was instantly a fan!  Every time a new video is released, my four kids all gather around my computer to watch, and we often end up re-watching many favorites after the new video is over.  My CD arrived today (yay!) and I immediately stuck it in the car so we could listen on the way to activities.  I can safely say that this is the first and only music that ALL my children will listen to without asking me to turn it down (or off) or wanting to pick something else.  Everyone agrees?  Must be awesome!  And it is!<br /><br />The Piano Guys have done a fantastic job with their arrangements, and picked many of our favorites for this first album.  The flow of music is great, too.  One piece flows into the next without leaving the listener feeling jarred.  Just a smooth, natural movement through several different styles.<br /><br />In one day our CD has already gone through six plays, and will have much more in the days to come.  We're already excited for The Piano Guys' next album.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|If you loved A Game of Throne you will love this sequel, but this review is going to be more about the how the eBook handled. I have an ASUS Transformer Infinity TF700. I loved the different views (landscape and portrait). I was skeptical about getting an eBook but i was hoping that they would come out with a nice hardback version of it like the Barnes & Noble Deluxe edition. I have to say that i am very pleased with the purchase. I started with the Preview which was more than enough to get me enthralled in the story so almost without hesitation I purchased the entire eBook.<br /><br />With eBooks i think the size of the screen matters, my tablet is a 10.1 so i can play around with the options to make the letters bigger or smaller and the same with the line spacing. Not sure how much i would of liked it on a smaller screen like a 7 in or even a phone.

B0084B5TK8|4.0|I like the old style of writing in the Bram Stokers, Dracula. So much is left to the imagination that sitting under my Oak tree in the fall, you can actually feel the scenes and settings described. So much better than the new versions.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked Bared to You, but this book is so much better.  I like how the author made the book so much more than Eva and Gideon playing mind games with each other.  The two of them have evolved and learned how the other one works and thinks.  They finally learn how to trust and love each other.<br /><br />Can't wait for Entwined With You.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Despite the fact that this work is tightly condensed, it packs quite a punch. The story flows smoothly and effortlessly but does pique some interest into some unexplored avenues of the story (which is inherently common in short stories), but wanting more is definitely a good thing - this hardly takes away from the success that this piece will no doubt bring to its talented creator. Definitely made my flight more enjoyable.<br /><br />Ernest Aguirre, author of [[ASIN:B009MRXMCU The Path to Self-Destruction]]

0446569895|5.0|This book is brilliant. You don't have to be an ozzy ossbourne fan to enjoy it - in fact I bought it because I read the last two chris ayres books who is the ghost writer on this one - and this book is a typical chris ayres book.  The way he writes anecdotes is masterful - but what makes this book is truly amazing is that he is telling anecedotes from ozzy's life - which in its own right is hilarious! ozzy himself doesn't hold back and is unbelievably honest on what went on - got to give him respect for that.  A great read!
B009F1FV5Y|4.0|this is a pretty good album. it is not as good as rock steady, my favorite no doubt album, but it is a good solid album. the sound is kind of a mix of what you heard on rock steady, reggie influenced tracks, and their early stuff. if you are a no doubt fan i think you will like it.
1441851917|5.0|I enjoyed the previous two books in the Wallflower series, but this one was fantastic --  Nothing like a flawed hero to make a girl's heart flutter. The unlikely matchup of wallflower Evie Jenner and the scandalous rake Viscount St. This book is filled with fireworks, tender moments, life-and-death scenes, and all the right elements to make one fantastic book. Rosalyn Landor is my most favourite reader and she does not dissapoint with this narration!
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My kids (4 and 7) love this movie! A little scary, but not too scary (although my kids are a little \\"tougher\\" in that respect than most same-aged kids), and they love the Greek mythology theme. Scary but not gorey.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|AMAZING!!!!!! That's like the one word that describes this book. But this book puts you through so many feels. It's exciting and romantic and just everything a 5 star book needs.<br /><br />Just a fair warning to y'all the ending is a major cliff hanger and did I mention the feels!! PLEASE Rick Riodan hurry with next book!!! (and gods please screw with Piper and Jason more. They're too perfect!)

B000VOC90Y|5.0|So I originally got this backpack back in 2010, when BestBuy made a pricing error and listed the cost as $15 bucks.<br /><br />I instantly fell in love with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- LOTS OF SPACE - I mean there is loooots of storage space to store everything securely.<br />- Two nets on the size which is awesome.  Bottle of water in one and umbrella in the other.<br />- COMFORT!  The padding is superior to anything I've used.<br />- Stand Alone - The backpack can stand up by itself--and thats a big plus to me.<br />- Laptop Compartment - Solid compartment with plenty of padding<br />- Hard Plastic Bottom, which means it won't soak in water--you can put it on wet ground and not worry.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I SUPPOSE the price may be an issue but you get what you pay for!<br /><br />Overall - So I originally got this in January 2012 I believe, and one of the shoulder slings started to rip.  Stared grad school so I thought I'd get a brand new bag.  Paid $63 bucks for it-which I find it worth it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its really great. it just takes a long time for coins to regen. especially if you don't have money to buy coins.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Sorry but I disagree with those who say this is a Roger solo album vs. AMLOR and DB. The latter are epilogues, while TFC is the last chapter in a phenomenal discography. Gilmour's guitar work is too seamlessly integrated to discount his contribution, the themes are too closely linked to the Wall and Animals to ignore. Look I don't care if KISS made this album, it is some of the best songwriting I have ever heard. It's fine not to like it, but you have to, HAVE to respect Roger's skills here. How many musicians can write at this level for their 12th(!!!) album. I also agree that this is one of the best anti-war albums ever made. Considering this band started with Piper, if you look at the trajectory of their themes and albums TFC fits in beautifully as a final statement. The band started with fairy tale dreams and now face hard realities of life, disappointment, and politics (including personal). Do fans think they should have been making 'trippy' albums forever? Just like real life cynicism and the dark side (!) take its toll. TFC is just as much a sequel to DSOTM as The Wall. Yes, its sad and bums you out. That happens. It's called growing up. You can't not listen to their earlier albums and not see how TFC is an inevitable conclusion. Finally, Roger is also the true 'aural' genius of the group. The sound design on a good system is amazing. AMLOR and DB try to emulate but don't come close to TFC or Amused to Death. Don't get me wrong. I am not 'pro-roger' by any means but he deserves a LOT of credit for the 'spacy' Floyd sound. There is always cool stuff in the background. Gilmour, Mason, Wright just don't have that sensibility as awesome as they are. So I can understand why people don't like TFC but to sever it from the previous albums or just call it a Roger solo misses the bigger picture of its place in their music.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Great imaginative movie. Tim Burton is a genius!<br />Acting is great-funny, creepy, realistic given the unrealistic underpinning of the movie!

B0094BB4TW|4.0|Overall this app works great. There's just one thing that really bothers me. You cannot go to a person's page and go through their pictures or see any of their albums unless they have just posted a picture in that album. If they post a picture, you can click on it and go through the rest but that's it. Also, when a person posts pics, they are cut off on the side of the page...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I read the whole thing within 24 hrs of starting it.  (I don't read that fast!!)  Absolutely better than Fifty Shades Darker...and I LOVED that book!<br /><br />I wanted to kill Gideon...then love him...then kill him...then love him...my stomach was in knots.

I start crying just thinking about him & Eva at the end of the book.<br /><br />If only love that strong truly existed.<br /><br />I will be COUNTING THE DAYS until the next one.<br /><br />Tears are streaming as I'm writing this.<br /><br />I read \\"Bared to You\\" 3x before \\"Reflected in You\\" came out.  I know I'll read this one at LEAST 3x before the next one in December...how do I know?  Because I'm going to go re-read it RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!<br /><br />*sigh... Gideon*
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The beginning was a little tough, but well worth staying with the book. I am recommending this to all my book friends.
B006ZEEHQS|1.0|I loved Hunter Thompson's outrageous stories back then but they don't translate to movies no matter how much J. Depp trys. This was one with two good lines.  The romance totally missed.  The conflict totally missed because you can't like or hate any of the character's.  Leaving a woman on the dance floor drunk with a bunch of men.  Who could like anyone that would do that?  Sort of missed on Thompson's hatred of Nixon and then drop it, Nothing good about this movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing solitaire and this is fast and easy to play.<br />I can play a fast game when I only have just a few minutes to spare or while I wait for an appointment.  This is great!
0307950689|1.0|I really enjoyed Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, but I should have learned my lesson after reading Digital Fortress.  The former books had me intrigued with all the interesting facts that seemed to be delivered by what I assumed was an expert in the field.  I've since realised that that assumption was made because, not being an expert in the bible or conspiracy theories, I had no frame of reference.<br /><br />However, I am an IT expert and, after choking down all the IT references in this book and DF that were nothing short of embarrassing, I recognise that Brown's use of 'facts' from other fields are probably just as poorly implemented.<br /><br />Along with the literary problems already detailed by other reviewers here, this book is nothing short of terrible!
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Excellent book - complex and yet simple, engaging and yet written in an accessible style, provocative and yet balanced. I will look for more from this writer.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Excellent app.  I found it to be simple to play, yet hard to beat at the advanced levels.  Relaxing, challenging and addictive.
1476712042|5.0|Loved this book! Loved the characters, loved everything about it!I actually found myself yelling at the book, so you know it's good. The emotions that you feel from reading this is over whelming, laughter, sadness, excitement, joy and empathy. This writer was able to capture all these emotions and truely make you feel them! This is a sign of a great writer.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am very happy with how well this app works. It runs smoother than the web site on my desktop. Happy browsing.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book capitvated me from the very first, so enjoyed the insight and the explanations she gave to so many questions.  Great, great, great!!
B005PK1G76|5.0|i ordered this product on tuesday night and recieved it thursday morning! super fast shipping! after spending lots of time browsing the different organizers/cupholders i chose this one. and i love it. it fits perfectly on my Peg Perego Pliko, and putting it on and taking it off is simple. big enough to hold a bottle for me, a sippy cup for her, my keys, wallet, cell phone, whatever else mom decides to cram in there. very nice product for the $15 i paid including shipping. i would recommend this product!
0307744434|2.0|Firstly let me say that this story was beautifully written. It captured me right from the start and for a few pages I was caught up in the beauty of the prose. However, as the story continued, I wondered really where it was all headed and I ultimately found the end result less than satisfactory.<br />I cared little for most of the characters and even less for the end result.<br />I finished this book last night and went \\"what a waste of my time\\"<br />I'm surprised that it was so well received and reviewed.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I have used the alarm a couple of times. I have not changed a setting or anything so I have not used it a lot. But it works. And seems to be exactly what I need.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|feels like real deal. wish there were more coins to start with. but still helps me pass the time I hope others enjoy. I play on my kindle fire
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well written. The detail is more than adequate to communicate the story and yet protects the security of process, technology, and communication. There were times when I wanted to know more but on second thought it was a good demonstration of his sensitivity to maintain a good distance from security issues. Of special note is the political thread that is the underpinning of the decission to \\"Go\\" from a president who is highly concerned with \\"WIIFM\\".
B000CNFC76|1.0|I love golf and when this movie came out in theaters, i just could not get into it. I was disinterested, and i was just...i hated it!
B007L96VCY|2.0|I love McCartney and consider him to be a true musical genius and one of the towering figures in 20th and 21th century music, but despite his genius this material is mediocre at best.  I was really looking forward to listening to this re-release, having never previously listened to the entire album/CD, but the experience was an extremely disappointing one for me.  There are a few \\"great\\" songs, but overall the songs are bland, boring and trite.  I can appreciate Paul's love for his wife, but Linda McCartney is a disaster, and should have been excised from this remaster.
B004OZZ624|5.0|The movie has great twists and turns and keeps us thrilled throughout till the end. Would definitely recommend as a one time watch.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Absolutely captivating from beginning to end!<br /><br />The way this story has progressed and unfolded has kept my little siblings and I on the edge of our seats. Every twist and turn, though somewhat predictable, is nonetheless gripping and interesting in its intricacies. The ending, or lack thereof, is one of the best cliff-hangers I've ever come across.<br /><br />I absolutely cannot wait to read the next and final in the series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very addicting. I have it on my kindle.<br />Definitely better than some apps that I have spent money on!! Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book.  my mom recommended it, and I‘m glad I took her advice.  I really like how Katniss gave Panem the finger.
1451627297|5.0|Short and sweet ~~ I absolutely loved this book.  Stephen King never ceases to amaze me with his vivid imagination and the way he can craft a sentence.  This was a big, long read, but well worth it.  The story and characters were so well writen; I think this book will go down as my favorite of the year (even though I'm a year behind reading it).  Highly, highy recommend!!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Excellent read  enjoyed it all  .   ready to read another book by Cheryl.  wish i had the mental strength required to do what she did.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I am admittedly biased because I love the quality of Big Fish Games. There's a lot of games out there.. but not very many great Hidden object ones. Graphics are astoundingly realistic and the story line is interesting. Also lots of puzzles within the game keeps it interesting. My only gripe (not a complaint really)  is that it does use up battery power rather quickly on my Kindle Fire. Hopefully it will be better with the HD Fire.. and I bet the graphics will be even more beautiful. Nicely done, Big Fish design team!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a great trilogy.  I read all 3 books within two weeks, couldn't put them down.  As a matter of fact, I've now read them for the 2nd & 3rd time!!!  Keep picking up new ideas lol!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have terrible insomnia where medicine hardly works and to find something to help me sleep is wonderful. it normally takes me 2-3 hours to actually fall asleep. with this it takes me 30-45 minutes because it helps me to relax my thoughts which are super overwhelming haha. again I love this. :)
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I loved the song so much that I even use it for my ringtone on my cell phone. The tune is so catchy,you can't help but sing along
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This is a great video if you like AC/DC very pleased with this CD.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was a Fifty girl all the way! I was told to read Bared to You and I'm so glad I did..... it is soooo much better than Fifty. I just read Bared to You last week so it wasn't too much of a wait to get this one. I read this in one day because I was so hooked on it. I had been waiting for it to be available and when it was, there was no stopping me from reading it like it was part of my life LOL. I'm going to have trouble waiting patiently for the 3rd book in December. Great book!! This would make an awesome movie
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read many of the reviews that are critical of this Reacher installment, and was suitably wary of spending the increased Kindle price to read it. But Reacher is Reacher, so I bought it and am fully satisfied that it was money well spent.  I have felt from the early days that the genius of the Reacher series is what goes on in Reachers head -- the strategy, tactics and experience applied in emerging situations.  This novel has a very healthy dose of this kind of inner reflection and evaluation, so I think the novel does not suffer from the longer stretches between action sequences.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have not yet completed the book..and dread when I do..already looking forward to the next one...my favorite character is jon sword..in my opinion this book series is the best i've ever read..
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|I found the movie slow and boring. The story just didn't grab me. I'll leave the explanation of how well the movie portrayed the affect of the accident on Margaret but it just lost me.  It's not that I don't like \\"movies of substance\\" but I just found this one forgettable.  Lots of scenes of Margaret screaming at her mother, other teens, other women in the movie. I found myself wishing it would just end sooner.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use calculator for all of ur math needs.  I use it all the time! its the best calculator imo
B008MG1E4A|5.0|What strikes me after reading several \\"Navy Seal books\\" is their honesty and down to earth description of an extreme part of military services and war. The quality of the people who seek these extreme services, never cease to amaze me too.<br /><br />\\"No Easy Day\\" follows in the same foot print. A truly unique story told by a truly unique protagonist in a truly honest way. The mission and setting is ideal for involving the reader who cannot turn the pages fast enough. While reading it, you feel that you are sitting in the back pocket of the team observing and experiencing the practicing and finally the mission. I am glad I was not there.<br /><br />Because of the importance of the event, I recommend the book not only for those who find the genre interesting but also for those who want to know the story behind a turning-point story.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Great book!  Classic love story between Dawson and Amanda.  Just got a little predictable at the end. Would deffinately recomend reading this book.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Great app with fun levels and new challenges. The power ups are a new twist on a great classic. Awesome fun
B005PV81MS|3.0|I saw the review from BDK Reviews for \\"Attack The Block\\"...he rated it highly.  I went in thinking it was going to be great.  I will say that the premise if really good!  It was a story of redemption and triumph.  I enjoyed it , but would not call it great.  It's a good rental, not worth owning tho'.  Also, it was hard to understand their thick English accents, so if you can watch with subtitles, that's encouraged.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The book was interesting but certainly not his best.  I have read all the Jack Reacher books and like them very much. I would recommend them to anyone that likes mystery books.  I would say this is probably my least favorite but I would still suggest it to interested people.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just loved it! Could not put it down.....had to keep on reading until the end.<br />I really like this author....i hate books that bore you and you continue reading only because you want to get to the end of the book (if I start a book I have to read it until the end..even if I don't like it).<br />Who likes mystery and thriller books should enjoy it....
B0054SMID0|5.0|I would ultimately say this is one to watch. Fast thinking and the movie keeps you guessing in a persistent way.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Excellent app for browsing your favorite magazines. The flip design makes it so easy to move between pages and magazines. You really don't need any other app once you have Flipboard.
1419701533|5.0|I bought this series for my 9 year old Son, he's an avid  reader for being so young. Well I can tell you how much he's enjoyed the books, but I've enjoyed them just as much! Great job!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Wool Omnibus.  It pulled me in and kept me voraciously reading at every spare moment I had.  I'm glad I purchased the Omnibus, because otherwise, I would have been anxiously awaiting the download on my Kindle of each and every one.  Well done!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is actually a good game compared to the xbox version,  it doesn't lagg as much as the Pc version does.  I love minecraft! !!!!!!!!
B008G12ERC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this cranked up on my surround sound system at home.  Its similar to the last two previous albums Muse put out.  They really enjoy making music and that shows on this with a lot of experimentation going on.  They've got tracks laced in passionate lush Hollywood strings over arena-scaled dub step drops and others with jazzy, sexy R&B, slap-bass.  There are even some breathtaking fancy solo guitar work happening within some of the expanded orchestrations threading throughout certain songs.<br /><br />It seems that well known artists and bands are releasing new CD's these days and the public simply isn't liking any of it.  Could it be that we've become too critical or are the albums really that bad?  I did not find that to be the case with this album personally.  Who knows how I'll feel after listening to it repeatedly.  Will it hold up to their last two great albums?  I think its got a clear shot.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Have tried many others...hated them... love the different size options... many free extra puzzles to download..I have deleted all other puzzle apps from my kindle.......also love the rotate pieces option
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|help when you forget about your calculator at home and you need to solve a hard math problem and when you want to play games after you do your work
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great way to spend a couple of hours! It has so many fun, creative and craftsy ideas, tied in so perfectly with some hilarious pics and cool new tricks! (Yeah, it's so awesome, that last sentence RHYMED.) You can find amazing places, quotes, thoughts and ideas, along with news on some of your favorite movies, Tv shows and books--just by looking at some pictures! And Pinterest has been made even more accessable with this app. I love it!!!!!!!!!:):):)
B00400NHRO|5.0|Awesome read; it made you think, laugh, and cry. Working in the healthcare field, I can defiantely see where the author is coming from. So glad it finally came out in E-Book! (I was waiting for a while!)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very fun way to enjoy this game without putting out a lot of money.  you get to see action and reaction to coins about the same as the real machines.
0803732287|5.0|Lots of use of adjectives in this story about a monkey's efforts to find his mother with the help of a butterfly who keeps leading the monkey to wrong species mothers.<br /><br />As recommended on my children's book recommendation site Books for Children ([...]
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I like it just fine.  I use it regularly on my Kindle Fire; it is easier than the one on my phone
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am new to Pinterest, and I love this app! It is quiet easy to use.  They did an awesome job--- get this app!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Loads of fungood mix of complex and easay level would reco<br />mmend. For all ages. Replay value is also great
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I will definitely be re-reading this trilogy!  Awesome read!  I can't wait for my kids to read it! I didn't know how the romance would turn out but I was very happy with the ending!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys, what more could I add, they are talented, dedicated, and musical genius.  Listen once to \\"A Thousand Years\\" and you will return time and time again to this group.  This is music for dinner, the beach, a quiet family evening by the fire place, or those few times one is alone to ponder life and organize our inner being.  This could be considered an investment in sound mental health, it's that kind of music.  Buy it, play it you will never regret the decision.
0345803485|5.0|This is a great book with an addictive story line! You won't be able to put it down :-) A must read!
B007VUCAVO|4.0|this is a great app. I like the way it let's me check on the way my kindle uses the power
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The energy between the two is electrifying. I hung onto ever word like it was the air I breath!  Can not get enough!
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Absolutely loved it! Very action packed sequel that leads perfectly into the Avengers storyline. Definitely need to watch the first Iron Man to get the story completely though- This is not a stand alone sequel. I love that this shows the weaker side of Iron Man as well. Again, it really sets you up for understanding the Avengers storyline!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! To see the change in everyone come out in this book draws you in. And the end...the last few pages I just wanted more words to show up.
B000IZ9UEY|3.0|Good movie, good acting, well worth the price and time. good enough to add to your video library. i recommend this movie.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was an excellent book for many reasons. One it exposes the nightmare the Lacks Family have had the endure and the tremendous contribution Henrietta Lacks made to the medical sciences. It was well written and the author did a great job of involving the reader in the lives of the people in this sad yet necessary story. It's a good read and I recommend it to all readers.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|Its a really good movie. and the dvds great...well as great as a dvd can be. One of my favorite movies so i was really happy when i got it. and i watch it all the time
B007GCY8FS|3.0|not enough action and for some reason i see Reacher as Tom Cruise or the other way around. im afraid this is the last reacher forme
034580404X|5.0|I was a little worried about ordering a used book set however, I was so greatly surprised when it looked brand new. Thank you for keeping your promise of having great books, new, used, etc.  AMAZING!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was fabulous. Easy and fun read!  As a patriot, it was<br />moving to hear the true story about how our remarkable Seals got<br />the man responsible for the murder of so many innocent Americans!<br />Every time I see a serviceman or woman, I thannk them.
0307730697|5.0|I just finished this book last night and it was the best book...an emotional read but a story that will hopefully inspire people to be the kind of person that Adam Brown was...kind, determined, courageous and spiritual. Adam Brown was an amazing man and he touched so many hearts and so many lives. Getting through the beginning was kind of rough because he struggled so much and it was sad to hear of him fighting those demons but that didn't keep him from excelling at everything he did in his life. It only meant he was human...and once he found God and turned his life around for good there was no stopping him! The things he did in his life...not only becoming a Navy SEAL but making green team, earning his bachelor's degree all while sustaining some pretty terrible injuries and on top of that, being the best husband and father ever. Adam Brown was amazing. And inspiring. And FEARLESS!
0553573403|3.0|Thanks heavens for public libraries, this is not the series I will wait for, toe-tapping, next to the mailbox. Barely finishing this book, it is doubtful I will continue the series. I realize Amazon has over 1800 5-star reviews. I wonder how many of them commingle the book and the HBO series. The language is good but not exciting, there are no phrases or passages that I wanted to return to, to remember, to share. Some books are difficult to pigeonhole in a specific genre and this is one of them. It is a blend of several genres with fantasy being the least of those. The writing does not elicit emotional involvement...no laugh-out-loud sections (almost no humor at all), no tears, and when finished this reader was left numb and chilled. It was a journey from one death (usually murder) to another and and I am left wondering what the fighting was about and apparently fighting and death was the best and most acceptable resolution to all situations and problems. Anticipation is one of the reasons to continue reading and once that enthusiasm is lost it is time to close the book and find another.
B00555X8OA|4.0|A useful review of modern psychological academic thinking. In that sense it's a  very well written guide to the field. The author's conclusions, and his extension of these conclusions into modern life, economics especially, seemed tenuous to me. I enjoyed his recapitulation of experimental psychology over the last 50 years or so, but found myself resisting the sweeping nature of the conclusions the author drew from them. I suspect that our minds and our identities are subtler than that. I would like to remind him of a famous statement of Einstein's, if you'll forgive the German: \\"Raffiniert ist Herr Gott, aber borsaft is er nicht.\\"
0525953728|5.0|This book clearly demostrate that the armed forces of the United States is well prepared to do whatever it takes for us to continue our freedom. These SEALS have demostrated what they are capable of accomplishing at any given time. Special Opeations within the armed forces represent the elite within the ELITE. An awesome book.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Great movie, great quality, i watched on my roku & had no problems. I would definitely keep renting movies from amazon, they have a huge selection!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|When i was in Hawaii i heard these songs and loved them! So i got the cd to listen to and remind me of my wonderful time i had in Hawaii. My 8yr old loves listening to the music too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It's very easy to use and it's quick to pin to your boards and to stay organized.
B008G12ERC|4.0|If you are new to Muse, know that the last 2 albums, Resistance or Black Holes and Revelations, are a tough act to follow. This album can be described as \\"poppier\\" than the others, but the truth is, both of the last 2 albums have a poppiness element also. As with the other albums, it varies from track to track, with very different sounds on each song. Some sound more like pop songs, some with more of a classical music element, some more pop-synth, and some that simply effin rock! The balance is still there, but it bounces around more here. They also added a little dubstep influence, which I don't really know how to take, but the fact remains that I still jam out while listening to it. I can't get enough of Supremacy, which is the opening track.<br /><br />I have listened to the album 4 or 5 times now, and I find that it follows the same trend that the previous 2 albums did. There are those 3 or 4 tracks that really stand out, which I look forward to on each replay, but as I start to catch the different elements of the other songs, it all comes together and provides an experience that I enjoy more and more.<br /><br />What we have here is like a new roller coaster at a theme part. It may not have the same hills and drops, it may corkscrew instead of loop, but it's still a kick ass ride, if you're into that sort of thing.
1475143389|5.0|Tho book has valuable material in it. Also at the end of the book you get a 1yr. plan to download FREE!!<br /> If any questiona arise email Mike and you will get a rply from him personally.
B0068THAGY|3.0|Very simple predictable plot, well acted but that's about it. If you like Spielberg's work you will probably enjoy this one. But I wish I hadn't wasted two hours on this one.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Game of Thrones. I thought it was important that the author included so much detail about the history of all the families, their sigils, and all the different castles. I am currently on book 4, A Feast For Crows. I am trying to read it slower because I don't want to get to the last book too fast. I have even ordered some other books on Mid evil history and castles. The author is very knowledgeable and therefore makes it so much more believable. I don't think there is a character I have not liked so far. These books have made me feel mad, happy and sad. I especially like Arrya. She is one of my favorites. I started watching the series on TV. Season one. I will read them all.<br />Thank you,<br />Darby
0316228532|1.0|I feel like this book was an over correction from Harry Potter, like she was out to prove she doesn't just write about kid stuff by fearlessly writing about the most terrible aspects of human nature.  Maybe someone will feel that's heroic.  I feel it's pointless and unnecessary because it's been done.  A lot.  The plot is simple and I see what she is trying to say, but it is overdone and becomes dull and cliche.  Many books of this genre aim to inspire one to do better and change the world.  This story just makes me depressed.  There is no humor to cut the sadness.  I dislike/hated most of the characters and only a couple I could tolerate.  Why would I read a story with an unoriginal plot and unlikable characters that makes me feel depressed by the first 100 pages?<br />I'm a nurse and I've seen and heard some very terrible things, things as bad or worse than what happens in this book.  The last thing I want is read more of that in my free time.  In the end, I want to feel inspired and motivated at the end of a book and with this one, I want to scrub images out of my brain I wish I never read.  Keep in mind, this is how I felt about the movie \\"the kite runner\\" so if you like that kind of thing, you might like this.  I HATE that kind of thing.  I think I'll re-read \\"the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society\\" or \\"the Help\\" to clear my head.
0525478817|5.0|The story draws you in, makes you feel the characters are real and then your head spins when it ends. It was a surprise read and is now on my list of Favorite Books
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|\\"You're the man now, dog\\" is one of the my favorite statements in the movie.  It is a movie about a black boy who was trying to find his own identity.  Mr. Forrester helped him do that.  I won't give the details for those who haven't watched the movie yet.  There are not a lot of characters involved in the movie, but I would say that the characters played their parts well.  It's really inspiring.  For English teachers, it is a good movie to watch with students who are not very fond of English--particularly the writing part of it.  Highly recommended.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I haven't read the book yet. Just sharing that no way am I going to pay $18 for a Kindle book, no matter who wrote it. I'll put myself on the waiting list at the library. I'll adjust the stars after I actually read it.
B0087HT36U|3.0|mindless game that is slightly challenging but is quite boring and is MAKING me rate the app to finish the game.... :\
B007GCY8FS|1.0|OK, what happened here?! This book sucked so bad...was this book even edited? Did Lee Child really write this crap, and if so, hang your head in shame Lee, you have just killed off Jack Reacher.
B0089ZEEYG|3.0|There are several games out there, in my opinion the following came out as the highlights for this gam<br />(1) uncluttered UI & very simple to play.<br />(2) There is a small story that is kinda cute<br />(3) The music is apt and cool.<br /><br />I wish they had more hardships in the game.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Easy use. Quick movement between accounts. Messages and attachments download quickly.  Had difficulty retrieving messages older than 60 days.  Overall excellent app for my fire.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|entertaining, challenging, and scary! hard to put down once you start! cant wait to try more big fish games! 20!
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|Gary Moore's talent shines in superb style here!  Sound is great too.  Four stars is too weak and five doesn't do this blues/rock offering justice.  Wow!
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app worked great last week but like other reviewers it only cuggests connectivity issues now.  appears there may be an issue between amazon and youtube.  reinstalled this and another similar app from amazon app store but no go there too (connectivity and error messages mirror others results).  this was a great app when it worked hope it gets sorted out soon
B007SYWFRM|5.0|A great way to kill time! My whole family loves to play and its easy enough that my 4 year old can play!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|finally I can enjoy God's Word on my kindle. I love this app. the different features that it gives are amazing. I no longer have to worry about ripping a page of a Bible anymore and I never lose my place because all I have to do is touch the verse I'm on and it highlights it. great app
B0099G3I96|4.0|On my first listen through I was a little disappointed. Where were the heavy bass beats and ska sound? Instead this sounds more like dance music with those generic drum beats sprinkled throughout. However after the second or third listen through great tracks like 'gravity' and 'sparkle' started standing out. Gwen still sounds great with such great emotion and energy in her voice, like in 'undone'. I started finding my self singing the songs while doing the dishes and now have 'sparkle' stuck in my head. I think this will be playing in my car for some time.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A great, easy read! The way it is written kept me wanting to keep reading to know more about what the author went threw not only having cancer, but understanding her background & how she was raised & at the end how she became who she really wanted to be & healed by all the experiences she went threw. Highly Recommend! New
1401917232|5.0|Seriously, why did this book have to be one of my forgiveness lessons? Who is to blame - Hay House or Gary? I know I created this \\"delay\\" but enough already. It's frustrating checking every single day for something that seems to be never coming. I'm officially giving up. Sour grapes.

B003PBB4ME|4.0|Not bad for a plastic grip. Does not hold an external monitor very well, but if you are inventive it can be done.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I can only describe this movie as beautifully frustrating.<br /><br />I think we can all agree the visuals are incredible and draw you in from the opening scene to when the credits roll. There is one central issue I personally have with this film. When I saw it in the theater, there were several scenes that flat out snapped me out of theater experience. It was like there were speed bumps through out this film that never allowed me to be fully engrossed and intrigued. I enjoy not having everything explained to me and i don't fault Prometheus for that. Its some of basic logical blunders these characters make that holds this film back. Desperately wanting to like a film not what i had hoped for from Prometheus, but it is what it is.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved this game! Great graphics and quality puzzles that make you think. Been playing BigFish games for many years and they are both challenging and fun.

B000JIHP88|1.0|Day 1: Assembled it. Had it up and running, playing music, spinning. The baby just loved it.<br />Day 2: Turned it on and it would not spin. It just made some clicking sounds and played music. Filled out an Amazon request to return due to defect.<br />Day 3: UPS picked it up for return to Amazon.<br /><br />Based on the number of negative reviews if you buy this product your just gambling if you need to return it or not. I would recommend keeping the box for a few days that way if you run into the same problem the return process isn't that difficult. If it breaks outside the return window you are out of luck however so you may want to consider that when making your purchase.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This was a good continuation of the original, which I really enjoyed, but a bit confused on where the series might be headed. I eagerly await the next movie, if there is one.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Perfect fit and works perfectly for those times I need ethernet! Genuine Apple product and shipped quickly and effectively. I searched around online and was kind of hesitant where to buy one because there was a lot of people complaining of their adapters not being legit. Well I can say that this is genuine Apple and works flawless in my 2012 Macbook Air. Thanks Amazon for the win.
B0092KOVX6|5.0|rest assured, I am a film/television buff; this entire series, story-line, cinema photography, acting, etc. is simply best-in, world class.<br />I do NOT have HBO and actually purchased EVERY episode one-by-one; I am very happy to have done so. This material, performance is worth every penny, worth every minute of my life that I enjoyed viewing....I hope it NEVER ends....though history says otherwise....enough said.
B002S8AGZG|5.0|might be an older film - and a chick flick - but this movie is pretty time less. got to love all the actors in this film - though young - they did an amazing job portraying their characters and send an awesome message of what love is...  would definitely recommend this film to anyone with a heart.

B008J05EL8|1.0|...but seriously? Fonts should be included with the product. You're subtracting significant value from your product by keeping these separate.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This book is a must for coaches, consultants and psychologists and anyone who wants to know yourself better. If you've read the best-seller, Now Discover Your Strengths, you'll find a lot of repetition here. However, what makes it worthwhile is that the assessment that comes with both books has been updated and the feedback you get now is so accurate it's uncanny. If you haven't read Now Discover Your Strengths, read this one instead.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I'm not a great fan of hand held camera shots, and we have plenty of them in this otherwise very entertaining movie.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|LOVED book two. Yes, Eva annoyed the shite outta me a few times but I sure couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. Yes, there are unanswered questions, but there's a third book. You're not left hanging at the end in terms of where Gideon was coming from. The ending- wow- wont spoil- but I'm happy the author didn't wimp out & give us an easier more pc resolution to Nathan.<br /><br />The sex was HOT & plentiful, yes! (& yes, yes!)<br /><br />Fifty Shades turned me into a literary smut fiend & the Crossfire series ticks all my smutty boxes. Thanks book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Mr. Gray who?  Hello Gideon. I really liked the first book but I could not put this one down.  I could have stayed in bed all to to finish this book.The plot was such a surprise and kept me up all night.
B000VX040C|5.0|The 3 eye lug Timberlands are still the best.  The sizing is good, and they are immediately comfortable.  A classic that's still good looking and works for casual and casual/dress with jeans and khakis....
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I am somewhat letdown by this Trilogy. There was so much hype and talk about it that I chose to read it. It is really just an adult fairy tale for women. I found the romance a bit repetive, as the first two books cover such a short period of time between the characters. Other characters just seem to jump in and out of the story for no purpose.<br /> I do like both main characters. He actually has a story to tell.I will read the third book just to see what happens with the two.  3 books were much to drawn out. The 3rd book should be writen from his point of view.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app b/c it keeps track of how much power I have left I can go there easly without going to menu and search for battery life.

B008N5UX9M|2.0|I love Iron Maiden obviously and Steve Harris has been the driving force of that band since its inception, more than anyone else Maiden is Steve's baby. Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden let's get that out of the way. When Harris announced a solo project I thought it was great for him, it was an opportunity to flex his musical muscle outside of the beast that is Iron Maiden and that he could do whatever else he wanted with this one record. In fact I was kind of surprised that he hadn't done this sooner like Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith had, but at the same time Maiden was his reason to live all along. It took long for him to decide to do a solo album and in 2012 we have Steve Harris' first solo album, British Lion. Actually it's more of a side project than a solo record really. The origins of British Lion for further than we'd think. Harris mentored the band of the same name in the early 1990's and nothing happened, stayed in touch with some of the musicians and years later they worked out some music and release this.<br /><br />At first I thought the title was a little bland, but I didn't care much it's about the music. Then it hit me that music is very much like the title, bland. It's generic and doesn't really go anywhere, yet doesn't exactly play it safe either and it ends up being quite honestly boring and blank at times. One thing that Maiden brought in the music was power, here there is no power at all it seems to be the exact opposite. It sounds more like a mainstream and commercial rock album than anything else, and I think outside of hardcore Iron Maiden fans supporting Harris there isn't much of a market at all for it.<br /><br />\\"This Is My God\\" opens the album and from the start you get a sense that it's going to be different than Steve Harris' usual work and it indicates much of the sound of the album and the direction they were going with. I just find this first song inconclusive, it doesn't do a great job at putting the listener in any mood and it's not effective and a little disappointing to start British Lion with. \\"Lost Words\\" is much better and paints a nice imagery and feature strong lyrics it picks up the pace a little. \\"Karma Killer\\" isn't bad and it's almost catchy and I say almost because the vocals just don't go to that next level to bring out the catchiness of the song although it has a nice chorus and feel. \\"Us Again The World\\" is one of the songs that works, it's one that I could almost picture Bruce singing and Iron Maiden performing, but again the vocals aren't there to take it places, they don't soar, they don't do anything and aren't pleasant, remarkable or passionate.. etc and the list goes on. It's a big problem on the album and it fails to excite the listener. \\"The Chosen Ones\\" and \\"A World Without Heaven\\" are to me the best tracks on British Lion and they're side by side incidentally. Those are the songs that got me thinking \\"well this is interesting, maybe it's not so bad...\\" and after listening back found myself thinking that the rest of the album should have sounded a little more like that. Musically they go farther than the rest of album (except perhaps the closing piece \\"The Lesson\\" which could fit just below that category) and they're catchy and got me rocking and kept my hopes up for the rest of the album.  \\"Judas\\" is one of the better songs here it has a two minute slow breakdown piece and shows traces of prog and is overall a good song and one that I found myself listening to more often. \\"Eyes of the Young\\" is boring generic radio rock and doesn't go anywhere really, it's just a very plain song with no feel musically or otherwise I nominate that one the worst track on BL. \\"These Are The Hands\\" doesn't do it for me, it lacks in the chorus and as a result never arrives or get started.  \\"The Lesson\\" is not a ballad, but it's definitely a soft song and it features strings and piano and while I actually find myself enjoying it, it just seems out of place on this album as a closing piece especially (but then again it doesn't really fit between any two songs so where else to put it?).<br /><br />I'm obviously a fan of Steve Harris for his bass playing and Iron Maiden, but I won't bow down to everything that he releases with or without Maiden. I don't think British Lion is close to be an outstanding album that's all. I think most of the problem is the vocals aren't quite up to par. They're not strong but they're not weak yet they hardly do anything even if they don't sound bad, which I realize may be an odd description but it's exactly what they sound like to me. There's very little energy in the songs too, as I said it sounds very blank at times music is playing but it's just... empty. Is it utterly unlistenable? No. There are even some good tracks like \\"The Chosen Ones\\" but the album and ultimately this whole project falls flat unfortunately and we're left with an album where not much stands out unfortunately. Again not dissing on anyone, they tried but it just doesn't seem to work. I wonder what Dickinson could have brought to some of those songs because some of the lyrics and themes that they had here had more potential than the final product shows.<br /><br />To me British Lion was Harris doing a side project and not a solo album it was great for him that for the first time he did something besides Iron Maiden. It was a way for him to do stuff more akin to that of bands he idolized in the 1970's like Thin Lizzy and although it doesn't sound much like his influences it sounds more like 70's and particularly 80's rock than Heavy Metal (even the songs are considerably shorter than some of what Maiden has being doing with their last four albums. I don't hate British Lion, but I don't love it. The album could have benefited greatly from better production too. To me it's not totally a throwaway and it's not gold either but I'm definitely on the fence about this one and I will remember it as more of a novelty, an experiment, something outside of Maiden for Harris than a good, rock album. The main problem is the vocals aren't strong enough nor do they stand out to bring out the music and make it stand, in fact it's the opposite it brings it down. I'm sorry but I tried it's just not an album that's for me I'm afraid 2 1/2*.specially (but then again it doesn't really fit between any two songs so where else to put it?).<br /><br />I'm obviously a fan of Steve Harris for his bass playing and Iron Maiden, but I won't bow down to everything that he releases with or without Maiden.

B0086T6XQ2|5.0|Very informative piece.  Learning how the creators love and cherish the Sherlock Holmes -Arthur Conan Doyle cannon makes the series that much more special.  Love the inside stuff.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book was really informative and gives you the basics of good eating habits.  The recipes give you a way to use different foods in different ways to allow a healthy non-boring meal.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The mark of Athena is possibly Rick Rioridan's best work to date. His works has progressed greatly with each progressive novel. This latest novel has grown a whole new depth to it and is enjoyable to readers of all age. Rick Rioridan has out classed other children's fantasy novels with this latest. Highly recommended.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I downloaded this game because the reviews were high.  So, it's only fair to leave my own review.  The game is pretty addictive.  The missions keep you interested and are somewhat challenging at times.  I also keep my 9 year old son busy with this game.  Decent graphics and lots of fun.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love that there are so many free puzzles,  by far the best jigsaw puzzle game!! would definitely reccomend to people!!!
B008BM9L72|5.0|The best trilogy ever! I could not put my kindle down! And didn't want the story to end. Amazing characters can't wait for the movie.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|great game. it has very good controls. it reminds me of Mario a must play game. down load today well worth it
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a fun game that can quickly become addicting. Graphics are very good and love the characters. As to the complainers regarding in-app purchases... the description clearly states that in-app purchases are available and advises users to disable them in the settings if users do not want the option. I did so immediately after downloading and it was quick and easy to do. Parents who plan to allow children to play the game should act responsibly and take the time to put purchase restrictions in place rather than blame the developers of such games. These types of games are not new nor are in-app purchases and they are unlikely to disappear any time soon. My only legitimate complaint about this game is the difficulty when trying to exit. I have to shut my Kindle Fire down in order to get out of the game which is extremely aggravating. If the developer fixes this issue I will revise my review to 5 stars.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|I loved the movie and the music.  Great movie, great music.  What's not to like?  If you like Abba you will LOVE this CD!
B007SGM084|3.0|I found the trilogy quite entertaining for at least the first third.  After that the author seemed to have little to share but more of the same.  In addition, I was put off a bit by the high number of grammatical issues I noticed in the narration of a protagonist who is a college English major.  I shouldn't have bought all three novels together but was going on a trip and downloaded them before leaving to ensure I had reading material for the plane.  I'm not entirely certain why the novels got such a following, and I admit my purchasing them was probably due to word-of-mouth promotion I might have been better off to ignore.  Still, there was humor and passion which I enjoyed.  In short, If the editing had been decent, and I had only bought the first book, I would have been perfectly pleased by the purchase.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have had a hard time putting Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle down.  I am so glad that I purchased the bundle and not just \\"Fifty Shades\\".  I find myself wanting to read on and on and on.  I just can't get enough of Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele.  Their relationship is one that is both spellbinding and intriguing.  Will there be a \\"next round\\"?  I was glad to find out the true reasons for Mr. Grey's addiction and glad to see how Ms. Steele was able to break through and bring him out of his self-imprisonment!  This is a very very good series.  You won't want to put it down, I promise!
1401322786|5.0|As always a superb novel by Mitch. Great story that makes you think every chapter about your life and what time actually means for you
B007SGM084|5.0|I read the trilogy in 5 days ... I couldn't drop the book! Is a story about true love, a modern fairy tale!
B0074VTHKM|3.0|This book began with several chapters about an accused murderer who jumped bail. As the book began to focus on Theo Boone, the bail jumper was ignored and never again mentioned with no conclusion about his status.<br /><br />In general, the book was enjoyable with not a lot of suspense. Theo is an interesting character. His parents and uncle added nicely to Theo's issues.<br /><br />In summary, it was good light reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best calculator app hands down! The reviews back it. Even gives tips and pointers. You won't be disappointed,  try it!!!
B002V0GZ9M|4.0|This movie, while not realistic, is incredibly romantic.  Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves have the incredible chemistry they had in Speed even though they are apart a majority of the movie. Filled with laughs, tears, and magic I highly recommend this film!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game kept me busy! lots to do.really fun my friends loved it when I showed them.cant wait to keep playing!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I purchased this book as one of my first choices for my Kindle after reading the Book Reviews in my Sunday paper. It was the number one<br />choice for several weeks.<br />The book is well written, and the chapters are cleverly arranged to keep the reader guessing until the end.<br />The only thing I object to are the number and the constant use of the f-word. In my opinion, it isn't necessary to the plot.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you like supermario bros or games simaliar to that you will love this game its fun and creative and i would highly recamend this to anybody!!!!(:

B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a good product given the size. It's extremely small and can fit anywhere. The diamond rod for serrated blades is an added advantage. But angular sharpening edges do not do the job perfectly. It is not a replacement for a file and stone. Get a bigger sharpener if you want a seriously good edge. Keep this for hunting trips and on the job sharpening.
B0016J81B4|5.0|The title says it all. I work in the food industry and they are great. No more wet, smelly, and stained shoes. Love they are waterproof and do not absorb smells.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Game is allot of fun but skillfully designed to encourage you to buy coins. Enjoy playing,however new coins take 30 seconds to regerate. Prizes are hard to win because they are usually droppel close to the sides of the table & slide off the sides. I congradulate the game designer, definitely a $$$ maker for them, if you get addicted to playing. Keep in mind the player only gets 40 coins a day. Other then that, I love the game. However I will not spend $$$ to buy coins which is extremely tempting. HA.
1423140605|5.0|First off, I love Greek mythology and how the Roman mythology is similar and different.  I really like how Riordan takes the two and modernizes the mythologies so everyday readers can understand the myths.<br /><br />This book was great!  It was cool to see the prophecy unfold and people from the two camps come and work together.<br /><br />One part of the books that I love is how Riordan brings up little things in our culture.  In one instance in the book Riordan brings up a myth and refers to the Mythbusters and how they \\"busted\\" a myth.  Riordan goes one step further and says in Percy Jackson's world the myth wasn't busted because they didn't use imperial/celestial bronze.  Just little things like this make me smile and keep reading.<br /><br />One thing I was disappointed with is that I wish there was more material from Percy's point of view (POV).  Don't get me wrong, we read stuff from Percy's POV, but not as much as I would have liked.  One person in the reviews for this book mentioned that they thought Percy was a \\"filler\\" character and I would have to disagree.  Percy is changing and getting older.  His role therefore must change too.  Percy is one of the main characters that link all the other characters together.  He can't have all the adventures or that would put the other characters as useless and if you want the other characters to be involved, you have to share the limelight.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book.  The first one (The Lost Hero) and the second one (The Son of Neptune) set-up the conflict and introduces us to the new Roman camp and the new major conflict for the series.  The third one (The Mark of Athena) gives us the action of how the conflict will be solved and finishes a major part in setting the conflict straight.  There definitely will be more books, but it's not a cliffhanger (hee hee - for those of you who have read this...;) ) and will give a nice set up for the next book.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|It was an Movie. it was a bit slow in the beginning.  not a lot of character development, but overall I enjoyed the movie.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|After discovering Thomas Bergersen online, I immediately fell in love with his music. This whole album is a success. Each song is a masterpiece of epic classical music, similar to something you would hear in a movie trailer, but much expanded upon. In my opinion, each song tells its own story in a unique and beautiful melding of melodies. For such high quality music and so much of it in one album (19 tracks, roughly 75 minutes of music), this album is very affordable and worth it. For those who are fans of Two Steps From Hell, this is somewhat different from the duo's work, but not at all worse and definitely a must buy. I don't regret my purchase at all and cannot wait for the next album to be released (if there will be one).
1415941394|3.0|As someone who is not a fan of Barack Obama as a politician (though I am even less a fan of Mitt Romney), I have to say that I was somewhat pleasantly surprised by this book.  Which is not to say I thought it was great, but it definitely gave a more nuanced picture of Obama as a person than his critics typically present.  First of all, he (like Romney) is clearly an intelligent man.  He writes competently, and sometimes beautifully.  It's interesting learning about his childhood and family background, and how they have informed his character, for better or worse.  And the later parts about his adult life, such as when he is working in Chicago as a community organizer, shed some light on issues such as race relations in this country.<br /><br />Certain passages have been completely overblown by a bunch of idiots who clearly haven't even read the book, such as the bit about how he tasted dog meat as a child living in Indonesia, which in context is really not a big deal (he also ate snake meat, and his step-father promised him tiger meat!).  But others perhaps haven't received enough attention, such as those about his drug use---not that I think his smoking marijuana during his school years is all that scandalous, but in light of his continued aggressive enforcement of our failed federal drug policy, his treating his own drug use that lightly while he's having people imprisoned for the same thing is truly despicable hypocrisy.<br /><br />But where it gets really disturbing in light of subsequent events is his description of his meeting with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, and the beginnings of his own religious awakening and conversion to Christianity as a consequence of hearing Wright's sermon \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" (from which Obama took the title of his subsequent book).  If the book has a theme, it's that we're all in it together and we should be our brother's keeper---and you can see how this translates in Obama's mind into his \\"spread the wealth around\\", \\"you didn't build that\\" mentality and policies.  But in the end, he doesn't seem to draw any firm conclusions and the book doesn't have as much to say as perhaps it might have.<br /><br />I listened to the book on audio, and as someone who is not a fan of his speechifying style I have to say that I found Obama's reading of it to be quite good...most authors who try to narrate their own audiobooks are really dreadful, but Obama is engaging, and comes across as genuine and sincere for the most part, with only occasional lapses into self-satisfied smugness (all of which is not the case in [[ASIN:0307455874 The Audacity of Hope]]---what a difference a couple of years can make!).  And he also had the decency to do abridgments  of his books for the audio editions, unlike Mitt Romney with [[ASIN:B0045JK6EC No Apology]], which I'm sure greatly improved them.  Two and a half stars.t build that\\" mentality and policies.

B005S9EJ14|2.0|It was interesting to see a film blend a few localities in India with that Bollywood touch, such as the westernized exuberance of our young hotel part owner/manager. That storyline was then interwoven with Hollywood style characters, mostly British retirees, seeking a place to reinvigorate their lives. The overall concept had potential for some creative interweaving of cultures but unfortunately the subplots for each of the retirees as well as for our hotel manager came out as artificial as a Hollywood tele soap opera. A formula box of cliché/stereotyped characters. The hotel manager's love for his girl friend who works as an English speaking phone telemarketing rep; the untouchable servant; the various dynamics amongst the British; all not only were written like a \\"cheap paperback novel\\" but the acting for each character came out \\"too acting like\\". Very contrived.
B004QO9ZVG|2.0|It was with great anticapation that I read my first Wallander book titled The Troubled Man. I was very disappointed. Lots of clues and scene setting took place but very few conclusions other than a paragraph or too on the last page or so explaining disappearance of rocks,discovery of shoes next to a body and other tit bits provided to us along the way.I was hoping those peices of information might have been woven into the narrative somewhat more interestingly and not just lumped on the last page....\\" the dead men had taken their secrets with them...\\". Not good enough. I wanted to know the secrets. Hadn't I purchased the book read it? I deserved an explanation. Another thing why was one of the desk drawers left a mess? Did he go to Cambodia? I wanted to know. Very poor finish. Love the movies.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Love it ....... Perfect music for the road,or getting your heart started if its beating slowly.  Sounds with a sense of humor and strength together; altogether tasty and fine.
B007S3S8HO|2.0|The concept behind this toy is so great, it's a pity the execution was so shoddy and stingy. For a list price of thirtyish bucks, you expect more than the pitiful handful of pieces in this box, and you expect it to work well enough that kids can actually play with it without extreme frustration. So imagine my dismay when my Angry Birds loving 6 year old was frustrated to the point of tears in only ten minutes of playtime with this set. I don't blame her. It is hard to make the pieces stay or work the way they should. Really too bad this isn't a more generous, functional game.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|As always with Clild, a good read about an invincible man - thoroughly enjoyable - looking forward to the next one - recommended
B0025KVLT2|5.0|This is by far my favorite Beatles album. I'd say the rest of their albums are tied for second, but this was a great album where you could hear the band transitioning and maturing from the pop sound to a more experimental rock. Can't recommend enough.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Have just read about 50 pages. So far, so good and worth the wait. A book to savor not speed read...
B00992CF6W|5.0|Although some things you can do on the computer with minecraft aren't included on the kindle fire version... this Minecraft version rocks!!! I have had it for 10 days and I am obsessed with it!! ifmt rocks and I have made so many different worlds and building that I am on it as much as I can!! not a waste of money!!!! MUST GET!!!!!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is another excellent installment of the Heroes of Olympus series.  Again, Mr.Riordan has masterfully written another segment of this wonderful adventure.  The ending will leave the reader desiring more!<br /><br />I have this book as a Kindle book; I use the Kindle app on an iPad.  I have not had any problems with crashes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy these games a lot, because they eat up boredom and are not too difficult to learn how to play.
B003Y5H5HY|2.0|I watched the Swedish trilogy before watching this one.  WOW what a difference.  The Swedish version with its longer format went into much more detail and character development.  In short, if you don't mind dubbing or reading subtitles, get the Millennium Trilogy and leave this one behind.  Noomi Rapace makes a much better Lisbeth Salander than Rooney Mara could ever dream to be.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This is a massive set. Massive!  Carrying out of the Lego store was a bit of a chore, but my was it worth it! My wife and I picked this up at our nearest Lego store last weekend and had a blast building it together. Part of the Lego Modular Buildings, the building is designed more for its size and aesthetic appeal thn as a gimmick filled playset for kids, but I imagine anyone with a passion for Lego and enough of an attention span to build this will enjoy it.  The set is quite huge, taking the title from the Haunted House as the largest Lego set I own.  While there are lots of great reviews of this set out there, I'll give you some of my thoughts on this set.<br /><br />The Facts:<br />  # of Pieces: 2766<br />  Minifigures: A Bride, Groom, Mayor, Press Photographer, Secretary, Janitor, male child, female child.<br /><br />The Positives:<br /><br />*Can I say the size of the set again?  This thng is really, really large and solid.  It takes quite some time to build (I worked on it for probably around 8-10 hours on and off)so if you enjoy building the setsm, you'll love this. It was a pretty fun build with some neat design work and some unusual building techniques from time to time.<br /><br />*While some folks are commenting that the interior is rather bland, I was pretty pleased with it. The first floor has a business office with a computer and keyboard, lots of drawers, and a plant, a town hall with a podium and a town crest, a really nice tiled entryway, and a neat bust outside of the elevator.<br /><br />*The second floor has the mayor's office with a reception area, balcony, wall paintings, and lamps.  The third floor is a conference room with a table and plenty of seats.<br /><br />*The exterior of the building has some beautiful design work to give the building columns, tall windows, and an amazing clocktower.<br /><br />*The working elevator is quite fun and makes everything realistically accessible. There's even a ladder at the top of the elevator shaft to allow roof access.<br /><br />*You get quite a few minifigures with the set and some fun accessories: a popsicle, broom, money, magnifying glass, and a neat camera.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />*The first floor has very high walls, making it difficult for larger hands to get in and position minifigures.  The 2nd and 3rd floors are fine, but the first floor gives me trouble.<br /><br />* The sides of the building are bland. I know that this is because these buildings are intended to attach to other modular buildings on the sides, but if you only have one or two modulars, you end up with a lot of dead space.<br /><br />*I wish the people had some more interesting expressions, but they all have the classic Lego smiley face. Maybe its to give these sets a nostalgic feel, but I'd like a few varying expressions for my minifigures. Easily fixed if you have lots of pieces lying around, however.<br /><br />Overall: Lego continues to outdo themselves, and I'm excited to see what comes next.  If you or the person you are shopping for really loves building realistic Lego creations, this would be a fantastic set to pick up. If you're more interested in more action oriented sets like Ninjago, you might want to look somewhere else. My Lego setup is a large haunted region with a graveyard, haunted woods, a mass of old castles, and a spooky, somewhat run down town. I've managed to do a little augmentation of this set, and have future plans, but I figured a spooky old town hall with a clock tower made sense for me. I'm sure if you have a normal Lego city, you'll have even more uses for this beautiful set!allow roof access.<br /><br />*You get quite a few minifigures with the set and some fun accessories: a popsicle, broom, money, magnifying glass, and a neat camera.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />*The first floor has very high walls, making it difficult for larger hands to get in and position minifigures.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I spent a lot of time playing this so that I could finish the puzzles right away.  I am done with the puzzles and am wondering what else to expect. is there more?
0345803485|5.0|Ok, 1st of all, had no idea the book was so explicit.  That part was a bit much for me, so I really went through the book fast because I tried to go skim past most of those scenes which was about 70% of the book.  I was enthralled by the characters and needed something to take my mind off and that it did.  I was actually sad to see the book end, I can't believe somebody could have thought up 2 people so stupid and needy!  I started to be thankful I am single.  I mean really!  Christian was way over the top, and Ana for all her huge vocabulary had the common sense of a pea.  I guess I could see why this was on the bestseller's list.  I kept reading the whole series hoping the characters would evolve into more than sex-crazed rich idiots.  Thankfully, the series ended and the characters did seem to evolve into human beings by the 3rd  book.  For literary quality, i would give it a 1.  For take your mind off trashy reading, I would give it a 4.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I'm having a lot of fun playing the game. There are some problems with the game, like adding neighbors and clvisiting random towns but the developers say they aware of it and are working to fix it. Please add me my id is nicolett80
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I think this is some of the best I have ever heard Maria sound.  She regains her ability to dish out strong metal-sounding growls but with tracks like 11:11, the power of her voice comes through and is sweet harmony.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app, it is even easier to use than my computer. The only problem is that sometimes it freezes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. It is like looking through magazines to me and pinning the stuff to a board instead of clipping out of paper magazines and tossing in a box to store ideas.  This app lets me quickly go to my board and start looking for recipes/ home decorating ideas/fashions/ crafts..etc.  Thanks for making an app!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I bought this movie for a friend of mine who enjoys music. I have owned this movie for several years and I always enjoy it when I watch it. This will be a movie that I will watch for years.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This sequel did not disappoint..... however it did move a little slow a first, but once it gets started hang in for the ride! Sex, love, mystery, and most of  all it is hot!  It will be hard to wait till Dec. for the third book to come out, but I am sure it will be a hot read on a cold night....
0345525558|5.0|So far, into chapter 3, I am mesmorized by this novel. A damaged young women raised in the most horrible type of foster care/home neglect and her blossoming into a full person. And I love flowers...so this is a marvelous read for me. Enjoy it!<br />OK, this is added after reading the entire book:  WOW, just WOW. WHAT a debut novel. I look forward so much to this author's continued writing! There are two novels about young women I've found profoundly touching in the past few years; the other was \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" Both of them I found \\"by accident\\". Both of them I hated to complete, but when I did, tears streaming down my cheeks, I just closed the book on my chest and sighed, lying there for awhile just letting it all settle in. This book is a triumph in so many ways!
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book was written many years ago and still pulls you in to keep reading--very heartwarming and thought provoking.  It was recommended by a book club who has just completed it.  Great Book-5 stars.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Although the DVD did not work, they immediately sent me package information to return it. They credited back my gift card immediately! Great customer service, this is why I love doing business with them. Thanks!!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|a lot like some of the games on facebook. has some bugs that need to be worked out of it for better play.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Our family loved this movie, but it does have some boring spots, and some spots<br />that shock the sensibility of the younger generation. I wouldn't suggest anyone<br />under 18 watch it, do to the nudity of the native mommies, even though it is all<br />innocent.<br />It is not a movie movie but more of a chronicle of a few babies' lives in different<br />countries, from<br />conception to birth and to toddlerhood.<br />Fascinating insights into the lives of different families around the world.<br />It shows that we all share the same brotherhood and same types of feelings<br />and need for love, protection, food, sleep, play the world over.
0525953728|5.0|I found the book to be written for the non military.  Easy to understand, and follow. I wish there would have been more detailed information, but security is a issue so i understand.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a sense of how ops really works.<br />you won't be dissatisfied or disappointed. promise.
B0087HT36U|4.0|The game is fun and very addictive, just wish I didn't have to write a review to access the final stage
B0019IOZGC|5.0|Casino is, without a doubt, one of the best films ever made in the mob genre. Not only does it open with the main character being blown up, as mentioned in \\"[[ASIN:B004XFZ4HC Be Cool [Blu-ray]]]\\" but it draws you into the characters so intently that you feel bad for the most notorious bad guy when they get him in the end. I actually found myself wishing well for a man who had screwed another guy's head in a vise until his eye popped out...odd? Not for Casino. Expertly written, directed and acted, this movie is a must have if you like things like \\"[[ASIN:B002OID4VS The Sopranos: The Complete Series]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:B0030VANJO Wiseguy: The Collector's Edition (Seasons 1- 4)]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:B000KX0ISG Reservoir Dogs (15th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]]\\" or the other must have \\"[[ASIN:B000LPS4BG GoodFellas [Blu-ray]]].\\" If you haven't seen this movie fugeddaboudit! Pay de dough! Until next time take of all those \\"Very Dear Friends of Ours!\\"
B008NW67E0|5.0|Babel is an awesome album!  A great follow-up to the wonderful first album \\"Sigh No More.\\"  It does have a similar sound to Sigh No More, but so what!  That album was great and so is this one!  Why try to \\"grow\\" or \\"change\\" your sound when it's already so good!  I just want more of this sound.  I don't want this band to change for change's sake.  Keep giving us THIS great music Mumford and Sons!
B006XBSAP2|5.0|If you like Katy Perry, you'll love this (and if you don't, then don't buy it ...) This has loads of her hits and it's a great pop album.
B003WTE886|5.0|I LOVE this album! By far, Taylor's best work. The lyrics are so honest, so descriptive. And even though she's grown a little more past the whole fairytale thing, that element is still there but now with a darker edge and a realistic twist. Catchy material, but above all, honest. Faves: \\"Haunted\\", \\"Better than Revenge\\" (take that, joe jonas and Camilla!), \\"Sparks Fly\\", \\"Enchanted\\" (true fairytale song)--i just LOVE Tay-Tay! &lt;3
B007SGM084|3.0|The story line was fairly good. The writing was below expected. When I read a book, I like to enjoy the story. But in this case, I found myself rewriting, substituting words, adding NEW adjectives.<br />Because of all the hype, I expected much more.<br />I was disappointed overall.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.Altough not to shure what to think that she is taming Mr.Grey to the extend that she is.....
B008PZ69T8|5.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey: Classical Album is excellent. While I was reading the Trilogy I often wondered about the classical music quotes - so I ordered the cd & remember the books when I play the cd. Totally awesome.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie, and I did like some of it.  The special effects were great, the character designs were wonderful, the backgrounds were spectacular.  The Acting was good, and the casting was decent.  But the plot, and the storyline itself.  There were just so many things that were left out, or rushed, or just plain made no sense, and so much was left unresolved.  So yeah, if you want eye candy, check it out.  If you actually want a well done spin on a classic...keep looking.  Personally I liked Snow White: A Tale of Terror.  Not great effects, but excellent acting, and a really well executed storyline.  No eye candy to speak of on either side though.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really like this game! its really fun. I'm in Level 5-1 now and I'm trying to go to Level 6. I definitely recommend this to people who like to play Mario. :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I  Was told     about the   book. So far it is a really good book. i have really enjoyed it. I am ready for the third one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A really  good book , better than the movie. I really want to find out what happens next. :) :)
B000FC1HBY|5.0|But so far it's an amazingly engaging romp through a world of knights and deceivers, as beautifully described and well-told as the first.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I've always loved puzzles so this app is great for me. just wish there were more puzzles in the free packs.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Seemed like an honest account. Every side has it's story. I commend him for coming forward to share his with us as readers. I appreciate all he has done for my freedom & our country prior to writing this story.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|This is a remarkable book! One of the best I have ever read.<br /><br />Most scientists confuse you rather than help you. Quantum physics is readily explained in a style that is very readable.<br /><br />I have always loved Kant, Emerson and Thoreau, Freke and Gandy . . . and now Robert Lanza. He has opened up a new paradigm that envisions the universe and consciousness from a totally new perspective. A must read!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app.  I also have the NIV study Bible but this is much easier to nnavigate plus I have the ability to switch versions.  I use it to do Bible Study and devotions.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Once again, the game makers at Bug Fish Games have released a game that doesn't disappoint. it has everything I love about big fish games: interesting storyline, amazing graphics, and challenging puzzles.  like most big fish games, you truly get bang for your buck. Combining the fun of Hidden object games with the challenge of escape games, Enigmatis will definitely keep you entertained for a decent length of time. I would reccomend this to anyone age 14 and up.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Honestly I thought the first book was a lot like 50 Shades of Grey. This second book was so much better and made it very different from 50 SOG trilogy. I loved this 2nd book, Reflected in You, because it dug deeper into the characters.  I couldn't put the book down.  Can't wait to read the 3rd book when it becomes available.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This 5 pack of Maxell CR2032 batteries are genuine Maxell batteries and date stamped \\"23\\". 5 stars for the price. I've purchased this 5 pack twice from Best Deal Supply and they last long enough that I forget exactly how long they last. We use these mostly in our pedometers, which use a surprisingly large amount of energy, particularly when we are getting a lot of steps in. Still, these Maxell last longer than 6 months and less than a year. Energizer doesn't last a year either.
B00846REIS|5.0|Have not read yet<br />Think this is very very stupid making me review a book i have not read yet
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|the uses for evernote are endless. I use for both home and work projects.  synced to laptop, kindle and razr maxx
B008BM9L72|3.0|Although the book has a good story line, I feel it could have been put to better use. It became a bit boring and monotenous with the repeated sex scenes.  There is little character development or growth with all but Christian.  Ana is basically in an abusive relationship which she readily accepts, when applied to the 'real' world, many women choose to stay in abusive relationships, the reasons behind this are still to be determined.  The trilogy does not explore any of these reasons.<br />A disapointing book, given all the hype!  If one is so inclined, a porn movie could have done the job.
B000066C6Z|5.0|I can't stand all of these people talking about this movie like they really know whats going on....THIS MOVE IS SO FUNNY....so don't listen to all of those who knows who they ar....GREAT MOVIE.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|i really love this app amazeing app it works amazeing on my tablet it browser fast an show amazeing pics just amazeing an u can download on the app an do all kind of stuff on it
B008XG1X18|5.0|the pinterest app actually made start using my pinterest account and start pinning. I am now a pinning addict wen I go on. it made everything easier. :-)
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I love this app so much it lets you download everything and organizes it too I love it so much
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Art and music are so subjective it is hard to recommend to someone else.  But this album to me is feel good music. I want to dance or sing right along with the tune.
0553583182|1.0|The books received were not the ones pictured.  The book pictured is the REVISED version which is far better than the original issue.  The bookseller kindly agreed to a return and said that the blue cover revised version is only available used.  Amazon should change the picture to the white cover non-revised edition to be accurate.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Great movie! I grew up watching Batman and this is really a good movie and very entertaining to watch. Very much action packed and once again Batman saves the world!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have read all of the Twilight series and really enjoyed them.  They keep the interest going throughout all four books.  I have also seen all the movies, so far, but the books are better.
B0063GORYU|5.0|traditional fun with spider solitaire.  great graphics. works great - just like the PC version. and you can't beat the price!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I hate waiting for the energy to charge but I love it! Could play for hours if it would just let me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I started playing,  I thought for myself will this game get any harder,  its way to easy. Oh yes it will. I am on the last level and it is really difficult now. Love this game,  play it every day, very relaxing. Once I finished all the levels,  I'll start back at the beginning.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I'd read this book when I was a child but didn't have the book anymore, so decided to download it. It's a wonderful story. I liked reading it when I was younger and I like it now as an adult because I can pick up on things I couldn't as a child, and understand certain passages better.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|When I bought this book I didn't have any expectations but was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be one of the best I've read in this genre. I'm only upset that I am going to have to wait for the next in the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I found this to be just what I needed.  Love the help features which shows you how to use it and. enjoying using it.  Thanks
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I love this album so much I want to have sex with it.<br /><br />After beingn disappointed by the last four albums from various artists, I decided to purchase one from a band I newly discovered. I am very happy to report they broke my streak. This album is soft, hard, melodic, and forceful all at the same time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app its amazing doesn't crash at all on me. ts really good . I would suggest it to other people :)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day does it again. What a talented author to be able to make a reader literally hang on the every word of the characters. The twists and turns in this book make for an action packed love story. I cannot wait to see what becomes of Eva and Gideon in  Entwined with You. This book is right there with 50 shades but yet so completely different it's really not even comparable. It's a must read, as are an of SD's books.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I like this game but it is hard sometimes. I have to make the dishes and take the boy's money.
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|Steve is just Steve, what more can you say really?  High points:  \\"Weeping China Doll\\", \\"Gravity Storm\\",\\"The Story of Light\\", \\"Velorum\\", \\"Creamsicle Sunset\\", and my fave, \\"No More Amsterdam\\" (Duet with the fabulous Aimee Mann). The only thing I have a really hard time embracing is the \\"John the Revelator/Book of Seven Seals\\" spiritual.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I had heard that this was the best version of Pride and Prejudice available. I have seen many others, but I have to vote with the crowd. This is a stunning adaptation. The length gives it depth that you won't see in other versions. You really get a sense of the initial dislike from both characters and then their changing emotions. The interplay with the other characters also fleshes them out in ways that help you to understand foreign and antiquated ways. The visuals are are a perfect backdrop. They are so well done that you don't notice them, but you get the full effect of the fabrics and textures, the nature scenes, the variations in decorations and room size, as well as the feel of the different towns. The pacing is also perfect. It never drags or leaves you feeling like you missed something. I watched the whole thing in 2 sittings. It was mesmerizing.
B002JODV3S|5.0|Even though I just saw Steve on his \\"Story of Light\\" tour (and it was absolutely fantastic!), THIS is the Steve Vai concert I really wish I had been able to attend.  The blistering performance of \\"Building the Church\\" and the twin violins on \\"All about Eve\\", are alone worth the cost of the video.  Buy it now!  If you are a Vai fan, you won't find better (imo).
B004478GN8|4.0|Good design, my kids love the Star Wars sets. I like that they put enough mini figs to let them have lots of men to move around and play with. They like to recreate different scenes as well as create new ones.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|The app has been great so far, but worried that real money will need to be spent. Good game play.
B006OOHYIC|2.0|Loved the game before I updated it. After the update I lost my progress and have to start from the beginning.  Lame...
B005K17RU0|5.0|have had on my fire about a month and pulls up fine and gives relatively accurate info. ive taken my other local station app off now.
B008JTXRHC|5.0|I started watching Pretty Little Liars on Netflix.  To be honest, since I'm in my 30's.... I didn't think I would like it as much as I do.  But I have to say it is ADDICTIVE..  I'm usually busy when it comes on regular tv, so I've started watching Season 3 on Amazon.  It's amazing.. I watch it when I want and when I have the time.  The quality is great and me and my daughter watch it together.  So we have quality time just me and her. \\"A must see show\\"!
B007V2UGPE|2.0|fun game but really frustrating that I lost 8 levels of progress through level 50+. its addictive in a good way..
B00881VLCE|4.0|I play this daily.  The last time there was an update all of my puzzles had to be reinstalled.  Today,  it seemed there was another update and I lost all of my purchased puzzles.  Needless to say,  I won 't be purchasing any more puzzles - I will only use the free ones.  The puzzles work great on my Kindle Fire.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I do not know why every one is overrating this. is. way to much for a game like. this. put the price down and I will buy it
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app has to be the best thing that you can ever get.If you have not tried it you should right now!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I loved JK Rowling's style of writing in the Harry Potter books. This book reads like it is written by a 16 yr old.  I am only halfway through and will finish it only because it cost so much. Do NOT waste your money or time on this one.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|a new turn on a classic. match 3 or more xfast paced crisp colorfull graphics. if u like jewel quest type games you will love it too
B003PBB4ME|4.0|It's hard to call this a \\"professional\\" piece of equipment, but it's good.  It's plastic with a foam handle cover that I don't expect to last long.  If you have a need to have your camera low and/or moving, this is a nice unit to have.  And for the price of this unit, it's a good deal.  If you expect heavy use, maybe a better quality unit (metal) would be better.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I'm gonna keep this short as everyone has said pretty much everything there is to say about this film. It is hands down one of THE BEST movies ever made, EVER!!! The only concern I had about the movie going into it was the casting of Mark Ruffalo as \\"The Hulk\\", but then he turned out to be the best part of a film that was made up of nothing best THE BEST PARTS OF ANY AND ALL FILMS!!!<br /><br />For anyone who is iffy on watching comic book films, give this movie a go, you are guaranteed to love it!!!
B004PWGRLU|5.0|Wonderful as always to hear the best ever! All the songs I love and some I never heard. Plan to add more to my collection.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|This product is excellent for any user that uses the newer MacBooks with no ethernet connection. It's fast and more reliable than wireless. I bought it because I sometimes need to do Internet troubleshooting and it really bothered me that the MacBook Pro with Retina does not have ethernet. I use wireless but I sometimes need a little more juice than that and this product does just that.<br /><br />Note: Do not get me wrong. This product will not make your cable connection faster even if it can, it will probably just match it. It will be faster than wireless though.
0767817710|5.0|This movie brought home some of the crudness of the old west and just how violent it really was. A Good movie.
B008G12ERC|4.0|The cool thing about Muse is that they do not care. Whether it is dubstep, three-part symphonies, interstellar battles, conspiracy theories, they simply are not afraid to venture out and have fun while at it. In their sixth studio recording, though, the tirade seems to be heading straight to extinction, unless, that is, it is just a pebble in the shoe.<br /><br />There is a dichotomy present all around The 2nd Law. On one hand is the fresh sound of experimentation, latent in the multiple sources of inspiration cited by all three members during interviews leading to the release. On the other hand, it all sounds like an incongruous collection of singles that work well only partially. Even the sequence could be altered; maybe that's how they wanted their fans to enjoy this record, as a playful listening experience of individuality.<br /><br />That said it becomes obvious that The 2nd Law is a much easier album to dissect than any of their previous. It sounds segmented, with too many genres swirling without an underlying concept to stitch the pomp together. Up to the fifth track it is old Muse in action: Supremacy sounds like straight out of a James Bond soundtrack, and the funky groove of Panic Station reveals itself as a show stealer. Past the Olympic-touted single Survival is when the assorted flavors flourish. Free me sounds like it belongs to The Resistance while Animals would more suited for Absolution.<br /><br />I am still deliberating if the inclusion of bassist Chris Wolstenholme's ballad Save me and the solitary Liquid State was necessary to fill a void, or if it aims to a diversification in the songwriting process. Do not get me wrong, Chris has proved more a time he can hold a note and his composition is pure pop gold, but it is disengaged from the root. Ironically, the original cycle resumes in the end with Unsustainable, a guitar attack on dubstep, and the instrumental Isolated system, that could have well served as intro but evaporates quickly without resolution.<br /><br />What The 2nd Law lacks in cohesion it gains in variety. The execution is still impeccable, if one accepts the band's extenuating lengths of theatrics as normalcy. Srill, despite the overblown production it leaves us with a feeling of unfinished business. Was it lack of heart? Was it lack of time? Tedium? Whatever it was, I surely hope it is but a fastidious lapse. I have not given up on Muse yet, but they can only go so high before they plummet to the ground.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Downloaded for my Kindle Fire HD but not easy to use nor are game instructions easy accessible.  Waste of Money, even though it did not cost much.
B0036JU6CY|3.0|Kind of the same old story told in a different way.  I like the action very much.  I felt like the movie was over just as fast as it begun.  I have watched it a few times already and it is something I would see again.  Overall, the movie was good.  I was able to get a great price for it so I'm not mad that I bought it.  I watched it a few times like a said, but I would have been renting it for a few days and be done.
B007SGM084|2.0|I was very disappointed in this trilogy.  This story could have been put into one 500 page book and it would have been great.  The author has poor writing skills.  She tried to throw in too many big words that I looked up only because I have a Kindle.  She repeated herself way too much.  How many times can she explain that Ana loves his grey eyes.  This story would have been great if it was shorter with the erotic scenes here and there.  I wouldn't download the trilogy for $36.00.  Now back to reading my Sandra Brown.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I like this movie.  This is better than the first, Great acting, Great action with Comedy.  Great movie.  If you like action and a different story line, this is a movie for you.  You have feelings for all the characters.  I can't stand the mom (Great acting),  I feel sory for the kid (Great Acting),  I love the Terminator, even if he's a machine and acts like one, you still feel bad at the end (Great Acting).  This movie was made in an era when actors could still act.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun and addicting my 4 yr old enjoys playing it as well. one of our favorite activities is competing with each other while we are playing it side by side.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|I had to have this movie.  Clint is a great actor hands down.  You feel for the main character.  You are grabbed at the very start of the movie.  You feel for every character.  Every time I see this movie at the end I cry.  Clint looks almost identical to my late grandfather and acted like him too (very stern).  At the end of the movie, every time, I cry.  There are many funny moments in the movie too.  This movie is to build the main character to be a relative or friend of yours, for a very understandable reason.  You'll just have to see the movie to understand.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have never in my entire life been so caught up in a book that I couldn't think, eat, or carry on a meaning full conversation without thinking about Gideon and Eva. I can not begin to explain how the story has really stuck with me, and I can not WAIT until December 31.<br /><br />I want to comment about the comparison's of 50 Shades of Grey and The Crossfire Series.  In the beginning of Bared to you, I could pull out the similarities. I have read them all.....\\"Ana had a roommate, Eva had a roommate\\"......\\"There was a party in 50 shades, there was a party Barred to you\\".....\\"Ana has 3 letters, Eva has 3 letters\\"......\\"Both men billionaires who are broken.\\"  In the begging of Bared to You, you can definitely see similarities, but once you move passed the petty similarities such as the name, and wealth.  Christian Grey's story is a bump in the road compared to Gideon Cross and Eva. They are extremely broken together, and I had to see how it turned out for them. SPOILER!!!!!! When they split for weeks, I was rooting for her to leave him, stick to her guns. The emotional roller-coaster I felt for Eva was intense. Though I was gut wrenching relieved when they found each other again. These characters are so well written, that you feel every emotion, feel every hurt, pain, sadness and joy. I highly, highly, recommend it.<br /><br />Like I said, the story of Christian Grey and Ana Steele is a bump in the road compared to Gideon Cross and Eva
B002ZG9846|3.0|The movie itself was more of a kid movie with a lot of blood, action and swearing.  I feel like this is a children's movie that Parents need to supervise.  I know that sounds strange.  The action was great.  Story was for kids.  The Action and Swearing is for adults.
B000QCSA54|2.0|This book offers a valuable visual metaphor for something that we all, unfortunately, have to deal with in life. However, the message behind this book could have been summarized in about 5 pages. It was painfully repetitive and redundant.
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|I like the movie.  Made a long time ago, so there are some puppet parts that look to fake.  Other than that, I still like the movie.  I'm sure I'll watch it again.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|when I got this app I thought was awesome until I went in it it said the only way I could get in was if I logged in with a facebook account or email I have neither so this game is no use to me.  WARNING<br />don't get this app it stinks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got started on the Hunger Games bandwagon later than most. Originally I had no real interest. I actually was invited by my sister to go see the movie at the $2.00 movie theater and absolutely loved the movie. I was so hooked that I had to read the books, I read The Hunger Games then Catching Fire and then Mockingjay.  I have even reread each book.  Catching Fire catches your attention and puts you into the story as well as keeps you going and going that you have to just keep reading the next chapter and the next book.  To be honest it is going to be very hard to wait another year for Catching Fire the<br />next movie to come out. Having these books on my Kindle are great because I just keep rereading and they will be available to read again prior to seeing the movie in Nov 2013. Thank you Suzanne Collins for your amazing work.
B003Y5H5B0|3.0|Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) hung out with very different crowds in high school, but when both end up in the police academy together, they form an unlikely friendship that continues when they hit the streets. After screwing up a bust on park patrol, Jenko and Schmidt are sent to '21 Jump Street', where they are tasked by their hard-ass captain (Ice Cube) to go undercover, as high school students, to break a drug dealing ring operating out of a local high school, cue hijinks.<br /><br />'21 Jump Street' pretty much follows the same structure you've seen in other police action-comedies like `Cop Out' or `Big Momma's House'; our lead characters are mismatched partners, given a relatively simple case, whereby they spend maybe thirty percent of the movie investigating and solving the case and filling the other seventy percent with gags. Whether you'll enjoy this film or not really boils down to if you're in the mood for close to two hours of stupid, immature and gross-out comedy, usually involving Jonah and Channing acting like teenagers. It can be a riot if you're in the right frame of mind, or a complete dud if not. As much as I enjoyed it, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this as it is better served as a rental.<br /><br />The special features on the DVD are nothing to write home about, there's a commentary track by the directors and Channing and Jonah, a handful of deleted scenes and a so-so short making-of documentary `Back to School', pretty standard stuff these days.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it. it so awesome and really great to use in class and different things like that and good
B006GH6IS4|5.0|This disc contains a very complete summary of Queen,The greatest rock band ever. It is sure to please any fan of rock music of which Queen was one of the most amazing bands. Loaded with little known facts and thrilling to know How Much They influenced the genre and how they altered the idea of tours and performances.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I absolutely LOVED this series. As far as Mockingjay, I do believe it was a bit slow in the beginning of the book waiting for the war to occur and Katniss to be more involved rather than in a hospital the majority of the time and us not knowing what is going on outside. Once they get to the capital it does indeed speed up and get interesting. I do have to be honest that I am extremely angry that the writer would do that to her sister - it was just random, out of the blue, and was addressed in the book a little too fast. I feel like she did that just to prove that Katniss isn't the only one that doesn't get to suffer loss through out the book - just weirdly placed and could have done without (it seemed like she was TrYiNg to find a place to put that in the book). I did like this book but it is definitely a bit darker and gruesome (warning). I truly believe that The Hunger Games is the strongest book in the series by far and it gets a teeny bit weaker in the following two books, but that can be expected in a lot of book series and movies - sequels hardly measure up to the first.
B005721W9O|2.0|This movie was a fair attempt to poke fun at Star Trek.  It had some laughs, but mostly left me grasping for a reason to keep watching it.  I realize this is a spoof but, there was an attempt at character development which left me almost wondering which character was which.  I was just looking for humor and I guess I got a little.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|This album is among the most solid, all-the-way-through creative productions I've had the pleasure to buy in possibly years. Many albums have ups and downs; here, every track is solid, well-thought-out, and stands on its own. It's upbeat and catchy but still has 'grandeur' in some of the tracks. It's big sound, somber. It follows very much in Starf***er tracks (esp. Reptilias) - but I also love Starf***er. Sort of... modern indie rock, techno, and strong reverberations of disco beats. It's music you can dance to, or just tap your toe... but you have to move along with it. This is one of my top-10-ever albums, hands down. Major, major win from Mark Foster & Co. Keep it together guys, keep it going!
B001QKSWOE|3.0|It was OK, but the characters were more cardboard, too many loose ends, and I didn't laugh as much, which is why I really liked the \\"numbered\\" Stephanie Plum novels.
B00005B1W5|3.0|Though visually striking the music was not up to the standard of Yanni productions.  Both events were performed outdoors and perhaps it is technically difficult to capture the detail of Yanni's music in that setting.  The musical selections were well thought out and of course executed in typical Yanni fashion.  However,  in my opinion the overall production was not captivating due to the less than Yanni's standard of high definition audibility.  Often, one could see the musicians playing but could not clearly hear the sounds they played.<br /><br />I enjoy Yanni's work and am not altogether displeased with Tribute, however, if it were remastered, then perhaps it would become a highly valued part of my collection.  This production as it stands will be near the bottom of my Yanni's music library.
B00000K3D4|5.0|The DVD was new so it didn't have scratches, it worked perfectly, and I have loved this movie since I was a kid. What more can be said?
B001IF277K|1.0|The two \\"Sony Ericsson BST-41 Li-Ion Original Standard Battery for Xperia X1 and Xperia X10\\" that I bought for my wife's X10i unfortunately had very short lives. The first battery failed after about one month and the second battery failed after only two days. The original battery that came with the X10i lasted almost two years and appears identical in appearance and markings to the replacements. This replacement-battery performance certainly is disappointing and I am apprehensive about purchasing yet further replacements for these failed ones.
B0012GMV4O|5.0|I love Mountain, even though I know in my heart Leslie West is a one-trick pony; however, it's a great trick.  Telling America's youth about the joys of listening to Mountain, particularly \\"Climbing,\\" their best album, makes me feel like Charlie Brown extolling the virtues of Joe Shlabotnik, his favorite ball player.  Yes, he went to the minor leagues almost immediately, but he had some great moments, I'm sure.  Thus also with Mountain: for a short time they were reasonably hot and then they settled into decades of tiny venues and almost complete obscurity, with the loss of Felix Pappalardi thrown in.  I see them when they come to the mountains of western North Carolina (rarely) and I enjoy the shows.  They play the requisite songs, \\"Theme for an Imaginary Western,\\" \\"Mississippi Queen,\\" and the connoisseur in me longs for something rare that I have never heard them play live, such as \\"For Yasgur's Farm\\" or \\"Sitting on a Rainbow.\\"  Well, at least those songs can be heard on this wonderful CD, which exists in the Internet equivalent of a cut-out bin.  \\"Oh death in life, the days that are no more!\\"
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love that you can mix the sounds you like. I use this on planes and at home just to relax. Great ap! Highly recomend it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|There is just so much modern day music out there that just simply isn't MUSICAL. The Piano Guys take modern songs and mix it with the never-failing old school traditional stuff and make real MUSIC. Simply wonderful.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this was totally what I was looking for. way better than all the other sound apps I found. this one can actually mix sounds. that's something nothing else could do.
B001FB55L2|1.0|First of all, I fully support our military men and women.  Having said that, this movie falls very short.<br /><br />There's a lot not to like about this film. . . .<br /><br />The story itself is not believable.  There is no way the military is going to tell the wife of a Marine that her husband has been killed without having a body or positively identified remains.  Not only this, but the story and/or the writing just isn't there to make this a good movie.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire - I like him. . . but he was not the right actor for this part.<br /><br />The film is VERY slooooooooooow.  I wanted to fast-forward just to keep things going.<br /><br />Lighting - A large portion of this film takes place at night. I don't know if the original film is this way. . . or. . . if it is just the case with the DVD. . . but. . . it's VERY dark.  Even during the day or inside a house with all the lights on in the evening, it's still very dark.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. . . . and one that I really wanted to like.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|Great album. Skrillex can not make a bad album. Industry leading sound! sound sound sound sound sound sound sound sound sound sound sound sound
B008JFUUIA|4.0|\\"Pitch Perfect\\" (2012 release; 112 min.) brings the story of college-level competitive acapella singing, and what a fun romp this turns out to be! We follow Becca (played by Anna Kendrick) as a freshman at Barden, a fictitional college in/near Atlanta, and she feels like a fish out of water, wanting to produce music, but eventually charmed into joining the Bellas, an all-girls acapella group. Their big rival is an all-boys acapella group, the Treble Makers, who last year won it all. We get to know the girls in the group, and they are quite the characters!<br /><br />There is no point in telling you how it all turns out, as it is quite predicatble, but I never lost interest as the movie unfolded. Several comments: this is the first time that Anna Kendrick fronts a movie (I saw her recently in \\"End of Watch\\" and of course she had a memorable breakout supporting role in \\"Up In the Air\\" a few years ago), and she delivers. But to be honest, the true scene-stealer is Reben Wilson as \\"Fat Amy\\", whom we also saw in a supporting role in \\"Bridesmaids\\" last year, and she is just a hoot. Who said you needed to be a 'classic' good-looking girl to be a great actress?<br /><br />Then there is the music, which obviously plays a huge role in the movie. I was enthralled by some of the performances, such as the very clever \\"Since U Been Gone\\" montage of the auditions of the Bellas in the beginning of the movie, and later again when there is an informal 'sing-off' between the acapella teams, eventually seguing into a thrilling performance of \\"No Diggity\\" by the Bellas. The movie is a delightful fun from start to finish. I saw this movie when it opened in limited release this past weekend, and it will open wide this coming weekend. You can just see why this movie is going to do very, very well, as it has all of the elements to break big: great performances, clever story-telling, and just fun to watch. MILES away from your summer Hollywood  fare of explosions and super-heroes, yet this movie resonates just as well, if not more.ovie resonates just as well, if not more.

0307592839|3.0|In, A Visit From the Goon Squad, Jennifer Egan presents a compelling story with strongly integrated characters. No small feat when done in the context of a story unfolding over generations. The story takes shape in San Francisco in the early stages of the punk rock scene and stretches into contemporary New York City. As it does so, it weaves tragic, hopeful, and misguided characters into the mix, as the central figure in the novel, Bennie, an aging former rocker, hurtles himself into adulthood, ultimately as a record executive, and into the lives of those around him. Egan portrays the characters thoughtfully, often with subtle and surprising sympathy to those, like Bennie, who sometimes flirt with misanthropic tendencies. Unfortunately, Egan, as she has done in previous novels (to wit: [[ASIN:0385721358 Look at Me: A Novel]]), can get greedy in her story telling. Not content with the portrayal of compelling personalities and interpersonal dynamics, she will occasionally go for the overly dramatic scene or outsized, unrealistic personality. This can spoil the overall story, as it tarnishes the authenticity of the rest of the tale. You can almost dog-ear the page when she loses you. The page when you look up and say to your self, \\"I'm so disappointed.\\"

B006M7JCC2|5.0|Dying  To Be Me is about a woman who went into a coma and was expected to die from her cancer.  While in the coma she left her dying body and was shown what awaits us after the death of our body and communicated with relatives who had gone before her.  Upon returning to her body , she experienced rapid remission of her cancer and went on to live .  I am extremely intrigued with the subject of possible life after death.  I am also careful what I read and have a degree of skepticism.  So I try to read verifiable accounts.  This woman had advanced stage cancer .  She was dying .  She awoke from her coma , repeated conversations of people in the hospital  and recognized specialists that she no way should have been able to identify.  Her cancer started going away and was gone in a matter of weeks .  This is all verifiable .  So what she says happened to her while she was in the coma is more easily accepted by some one who is cautious .  Her style is easy to read and her message is inspirational .  Her experience can only be called miraculous.  Well worth reading .

I can see the comparison with the 50 Shades triology but these characters are their own people.  I really want to know where their story goes. . .

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The writing style belies the publication's vintage.  A contemporary writing, the writing mimics the style of authors past, when proper grammar was paramount, at times the obvious expectation of perfect sentence construction being allegorious to the unreasonable expectations of perfect behavior in young children abandoned by parents to an orphanage and life of servitude and most terrible abuse, a place where numbers are used to identify nameless youngsters.  This portrayal of a mature, unmarried and unrefined farmer raised in such a place, and of a similarly-aged unmarried teacher, the daughter of a strict pastor and his widowed wife, cleverly uses phrases that ostensibly depict classic, dry writing to disguise humorous references that the discerning reader will truly enjoy.  The story follows the trials and tribulations of a poor orphan, using the recollections of childhood to help shape and sympathize with the reader's understanding of the adult man, urging the reader to want only happiness for Jamie.  The author also cleverly describes the viewpoints of families that place proper appearances and etiquette above the human conditions that provide only the most basic of accountrements and less-than-genteel mannerisms.  Sprinkled in are characters that both horrify and endear them to the reader as friends and family members encourage romance when both parties to the courtship, initiated through a lonely hearts advertisement, would be satisified with developing a sincere friendship such as neither has ever experienced.  With God's help, and disregarding the differences in religious backgrounds, Jamie and Lydia explore a fated relationship that concludes in a satisfactory twist that only the most alert reader would predict.  While such a twisted fate satisfactorily concludes the book, the reader would like the story to continue, to continue to know and visit the lives of each quaint character this author so cleverly creates.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I've enjoyed this movie more than I did The Dark Knight and that's pretty hard to accomplish, but The Dark Knight Rises pulled it off brilliantly. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and I love the cast, they were all great too. There was a lot of surprises that took place. I won't go into detail, for those of you who haven't seen it, but trust me it is worth it.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie more than I did the other superhero movies this summer. The Dark Knight Rises was a masterpiece and Oscar worthy, compared to the superhero movies that were released this year, I am very impressed with The Dark Knight Rises.<br /><br />Anyways the fact that this has Blu-Ray, DVD and UltraViolet was enough to make me wanna own this version of The Dark Knight Rises. Don't listen to the reviewers that are complaining about UltraViolet, it's not as bad as they make it out to be. They're most likely iTune users, which I'm sure they can download their copy via iTunes, hence why it's not included in this package. That's the way they get their music, right? I myself prefer physical copies over digital, which is why all my CD's and DVD's are official store bought copies, but I love that the digital copy is included.<br /><br />Bottom line is that if you haven't seen this yet, but loved the first two movies, get it. You won't be disappointed. If you've enjoyed this movie, I highly recommend getting this combo pack.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Great value.  Limited edition zombie head is the perfect container for the blu ray set.  Nice to put on the top of the T.V. stand, especially if your house is loaded with horror memorabilia.
0307720950|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3F8NBOH6SJJ0W]]As in his previous books, Anderson introduces big ideas. In the near future, every home can be a de facto manufacturing facility. Rife with interesting anecdotes (including some personal ones), this is anything but a dry \\"techie\\" book.<br /><br />Read this book if you want to see a glimpse of the future. Ignore it at your own peril.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|What a let down, Jack didn't even shove anyone until the 37% (Kindle talk) and kill anyone until 82% thru the book.  Practically boring.  Had this been his first book I don't think I'd have bought a second .  We've bought his books and hope this was just a momentary lapse.  When he begins his books with three pages weather conditions, sunsetsor sunrises you know you're in trouble.

Sometimes, when I launch the app, it freezes, which is kind of a bummer.  Most times I can simply force close the app and relaunch it. Every now and then I have to restart my Kindle. I think that's happened once since I've had the app, though. Aside from that, the app is easy to use - simple and elegant, just like the website.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This dvd was bought for my daughters birthday. She loves anything that has to do with One Direction. She was very excited to get it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|What can i say i needed to replace my 3 year old controller that came with the system. The best price available was here at Amazon so i bought it here. The controller has had a make-over from previous system stock but it looks and fells wonderful.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love this app but there have been problems lately... such as my Kindle Fire battery going dead and when I get back on any saved world everything on the world is gone as if i hadnt placed one block.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is the best I have read in a very lo h time! I love Ms.Flynn and have read all her book so far. I thought they were great until I read Gone Girl! I literally could not put it down and stayed up all night finishing it! Everyone should read this book. I am an avid mystery and crime reader and usually can predict the plot, but this time, I was shocked! Amazing!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love it love it nothing like 50 shades. Its a page Turner . Cant wait for the next book.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Great way to instantly access great movie titles..  I was really impressed with the ease of the process and instant viewing.
B000000H64|5.0|This record is unquestionably the best Fear Factory record ever made, and is definitely among the top five metal albums EVER!!  They broke the genre barrier with this one and pretty much redefined industrial metal forever!!
B0002ZMITY|5.0|Perfect capper for the Ali-G show. Very childish, Silly, and Hee-larious. A little taste and this movie for a top-notch, munchy-filled evening.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is just an epic record, Taraj at her finest.  Not as symphonic as normal but it was actually a good choice with this one.  It's amazing what a band can do when they change their music direction and try something different.  Typically they use a lot of symphony and operatic antics, but in this one, there wasn't too much of either and it suited this record quite well.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reading a Lee Child book is a great way to make a 10 hour airplane ride fly by. You take off in one place, he takes you to his world and you land in a new world to make your own.
B0013FSXT6|2.0|I was curious so I had to watch this movie.  I did not understand any of this movie other than it seemed like Nicole's character expressed concerns about their sex life and then Tom's character explores an explicit sex realm.  It's like a couple hour hardcore porn with a story is how I saw it.  I honestly did not like this movie as I saw no point to it.  It's good for in-depth thinkers but terrible as entertainment!!
0547258305|4.0|Brief Description<br /><br />In the land of Seven Kingdoms, Katsa is a Graceling (a person born with a special talent that is signaled by two different color eyes). Although a person's Grace might not reveal itself right away, Katsa's Grace became clear when she killed a man with her bare hands at age 8. With her talent for killing, she quickly caught the attention of her king and is now used as his enforcer/assassin. However, Katsa is growing weary of the punishments she is asked to enforce for a king she doesn't respect. When Prince Po (who is graced with exceptional fighting skills) comes to the court searching for his kidnapped grandfather, Katsa discovers an unlikely friend. With Po's encouragement, Katsa declares her independence from the king and travels with Po on his quest for the mysterious King of Monsea--who might not be the benevolent ruler that his reputation makes him out to be. But as their journey unfolds, Katsa and Po discover new aspects to their Graces and their friendship deepens into something else.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />This book kicked butt! If you want grrl power, just look at Katsa. She's strong, powerful, opinionated, independent and stubborn. I loved her! Although this book felt like \\"fantasy lite\\" at times and I was surprised to find it was a standalone book, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also loved how Cashore made Po the perfect partner for Katsa--strong in his own right but respectful of Katsa's power and her need for independence. There is a lot of adventure and swashbuckling and fighting that moves things along, and I imagine that this would be the perfect introduction to the fantasy genre for young people. (Note: If you're on the conservative side, you might want to know that Katsa rejects marriage in favor of having a lover. If this doesn't sit right with you, you've been warned. However, I thought it was true to her character and handled tactfully and tastefully by Cashore.)
B003Q6D27S|4.0|I swear that I'm the only person who was clueless when the last scene was over, and I have been paying close attention to the whole saga.  It's a great movie with all the blood and guts anyone could want, but the movie itself was confusing to me.
0618871713|3.0|A graphic memoir, Fun Home is Alison Bechdel's examination of her relationship with her father, which was complex, confusing and conflicted in many different ways. Her father, who was a closeted gay man who never fully acknowledged his homosexuality, was killed in an accident that Bechdel is convinced was suicide. Her brutally honest look at her childhood, her father's complex personality, family relations and her own budding lesbianism are explored, and it felt so intimate to me that I almost felt guilty reading it--like I was poking around in someone's diary. I applaud Bechdel for facing her issues head-on, but I wonder how her family felt about this book. (Turns out, they must be OK because Bechdel has a follow-up book dealing with her mother that recently came out.) The drawings are in black and white and are amazingly detailed. If graphic depictions of gay sex bother you, you should know there are some drawings of gay sex scattered throughout the book. Still, this is an unusual memoir in a unique format and it is worth checking out.
B002QFYJF4|5.0|I have never understood this movie but I LOVED IT!!!  Tom Cruise did a crappy job with his incredibly cocky and stupid character, but the movie was still awesome!!  This movie is also very metaphorical in its own respects and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.  Definitely a must see movie!!
1451648537|4.0|The irony of this book is that it was purchased by Mr. Jenners (Apple devotee and Steve Jobs fan) and yet he never finished it (pooping out somewhere about 100 pages in). I, on the other hand, didn't really know all that much about Apple and Jobs (although I enjoy Apple products) yet I found myself fascinated by the Job's story. I think much of the appeal is that so much of the technology that influences our lives today (iPods, iPads, digital music, computers) were developed, perfected and revolutionized by Apple at Job's behest. Learning why Apple is the way it is and why it is so wildly successful was really interesting to me, and Jobs himself is a fascinating person (albeit not someone you'd want to live or work with). He certainly left the world a better place than he found it, and I think most of us owe him a \\"thank you\\" for his vision and insistence on quality products that work they way they should. It also makes you think about the importance of design in consumer products--not something I ever gave much thought to but now think about quite frequently.
B007WFR1TE|5.0|Demanufacture may always be their best album they've EVER produced, but The Industrialist is definitely not far behind.  They are probably the only band besides Slayer to have been around forever and still be able to create metal-worthy music.  They have also stayed true to their industrial roots which is very uncommon, but important for a lifelong career like they have, being pioneers of a widespread genre.  I have been fans of theirs since I heard their song in the Mortal Kombat movie back in the mid-90's.  Archetype was a great record but The Industrialist is mind-blowing from start to finish.  I very highly recommend this album as an addition to any metal fans collection.  You most certainly will not be disappointed!!!!
0375836675|3.0|After falling in love with Zusak's masterpiece, The Book Thief, I wanted to read more by him. However, this book was a real disappointment. The writing felt flat, and I just couldn't buy into the premise (a young guy gets playing cards in the mail that identify people he needs to help). The book just didn't work for me, and it was a bit of chore to finish it. I'm guessing this is an earlier book than The Book Thief, but it feels like it was written by a totally different author. It wasn't a BAD book, but I guess I was so disappointed after the high of The Book Thief that this felt really low.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Nickelback has had a decent history and \\"Silver Side Up\\" wasn't bad but this one was redemption.  I feel they redeemed their crappy music stumble they had for a small while. I can't say there is not a song on this album I don't like.  They also stepped away from their \\"good boy\\" persona and got a little dirty as is evident in their song titles.  I absolutely love this album and highly recommend it to any Nickelback fans!!
0143119680|4.0|Book Description<br /><br />A witch who rejected her magic after the brutal death of her parents, Diana Bishop is a historian researching alchemy at Oxford. One day in the Bodleian library, she calls up a manuscript called Ashmole 782 that has been bewitched. Unnerved and frightened by the manuscript, she returns it to the stacks. However, her actions have not gone unnoticed--she's drawn the attention of other creatures (witches, vampires and daemons) who flock to the library. It turns out that Diana has unwittingly found the lost manuscript that contains the secrets about the origins of creatures. Ashmole 782 is much desired but has been lost for centuries--protected by powerful magic that has kept it safe until Diana unearthed it. As various creatures begin to position themselves to seize the manuscript, Diana finds an unlikely ally and protector in a 1,500-year-old vampire named Matthew Clairmont. Although she's been warned to never trust a vampire, Diana finds herself confused by her feelings for Matthew. As her relationship with Matthew develops and a war for the manuscript begins to take shape, Diana is forced to examine her past, accept her powerful witch heritage and confront her feelings about her own magical abilities.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />This was an enjoyable read but--and I can't believe I'm saying this--it was no Twilight. I really didn't get all hung up on Matthew like I did on Edward Cullen (which might say more about me than it does about the book). Although I enjoyed the fun that Harkness has with witches, vampires and daemons, the book didn't generate much heat (sexual or otherwise). Everything seemed to happen too fast and easily. At one point, Diana gets into a bit of a jam but then tada! she gets out of it pretty easily. I guess I needed her to suffer more or for Diana and Matthew to experience more angst. It sounds like a strange thing to say, but what I guess I'm getting at is that I didn't feel a sense of danger or menace in the books to give it emotional heft.<br /><br />What was most enjoyable about the book was how Harkness reimagined the various creatures of witches, vampires and daemons. One of my favorite parts was the house owned by Diana's aunts. The house has feelings and gets ready for visitors by creating new rooms for them to stay in. Another fun aspect was when Diana decides to prepare a meal for Matthew and tries to figure out how to cook for a vampire.I think Harkness tried to create more modern believable  back stories for creatures, but she doesn't quite have the imagination and fun that, say, J.K. Rowling had with the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />Another area that might appeal to readers of a certain type was the historical tidbits that Harkness throws into the mix. It is obvious that she did some research to provide Diana with a plausible career as a historian studying the history of alchemy. The book is full of historical references, and Matthew is forever making casual references along the lines of \\"Oh Pope Blah Blah Blah... yeah, he was a vampire.\\"<br /><br />Readers should also know that this is the first book of a planned trilogy. I was under the impression it was a standalone book and, as I was reading, I kept thinking \\"How in the world is she going to wrap this up in the pages remaining?\\" It wasn't until the final pages--which ends with a very big cliffhanger--that I realized this was the first book in a series. The second book is out now (Shadow of Night), and while I do plan on reading it at some point, I didn't rush out to get it.books to give it emotional heft.<br /><br />What was most enjoyable about the book was how Harkness reimagined the various creatures of witches, vampires and daemons.

B000URDEB0|4.0|I have loved Nightwish for a long time and was sad to see Taraj go.  Annette came along and made the band sound more poppy than goth or doom metal.  This album is a stumble in my opinion though i recommend it nonetheless.  It's a great album filled great music, but Annette is not Taraj, and it's quite evident.  If you want the true the heart Nightwish music, this album may not be for you, but it's good if you're looking for a toned down metal sound.
1451627289|4.0|BRIEF DESCRIPTION<br /><br />Jake Epping, a schoolteacher in Maine (of course!), is approached by his friend Al with a very strange proposition: Al has found a portal back in time to the year 1958, and he wants Jake to go back and prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Although Al has attempted to do this himself, his health is failing and he cannot complete the task. Reluctantly, Jake agrees and embarks on what turns out to be a long strange trip that has consequences far beyond what Jake could have ever imagined.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br /><br />My description was very bare bones so believe me when I tell you this hardly scratches the surface of all that happens in this epic novel from one of our modern storytelling masters. King finally wrote a book that people who \\"don't like Stephen King\\" can enjoy and figure out why the man sells millions and millions of books. In fact, many of the reviews I've read of this book were from Stephen King virgins who professed their surprise and delight at how much they enjoyed and got involved with this story. The book is about much much more than the prevention of the JFK assassination--although that is what propels the story forward (or perhaps backward I should say). This is King at his best--telling a whopping good story with a big old beating heart at its center (not literally) that elevates the book from a \\"time travel adventure\\" to a gut-wrenching, heart-breaking story that will leave you emotionally wrung out. It is exciting, funny, scary, romantic, sci-fi historical fiction like it has never been done before (and probably won't be again). And if you're not a King newbie, you'll love this book too. Look for some of our old friends making a cameo in the Derry sequences!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Oh my god, This movie is by far one of the best and funniest comedies ever!!!  You have to love and understand raunchy, irreverent humor to love this movie.  This takes shots at so many people but in a non-offensive manner.  Seeing it in the theaters was epic!!!  I just felt sorry for my grandma who suffered through it.  But anyway, I am so owning this movie, my wife loves it too so that helps.  Also, if you love this movie, you must, and I mean MUST, check out the movie \\"Ted\\" which is another epic adult-oriented humor movie!!!
0143120530|4.0|THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION<br /><br />BRIEF DESCRIPTION<br /><br />Participatory journalism at its best, Joshua Foer (brother to novelist Jonathan Safran Foer) explores the world of mnemonists (memory experts to you and me) who can quickly memorize long lists of numbers, words, passages of poetry and more. Foer goes from covering the U.S. Memory Championships for a magazine article to competing in it, and along the way explores how memory works, what tricks and techniques mnemonists use, what role memory plays in our lives and many more little side passages that were always fascinating and interesting.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br /><br />This book is just fascinating. It held my attention throughout and had me mourning its end. After listening, I was compelled to try building a memory palace of my own ... and damn if it didn't work! More than 9 months after getting a list of 15 random words from Mr. Jenners and BB, I can still remember the list IN ORDER. If you're looking for an interesting, amusing and educational non-fiction book, this would be an excellent choice.<br /><br />ABOUT THE NARRATION<br /><br />Mike Chamberlain was the narrator, and his voice was the perfect fit for Foer's book and personality. (His voice had a bit of a nerdy flavor to it that seemed appropriate.) Because the book is written in the first person, his narration made the book really come alive. In my mind, Joshua Foer talks exactly like Mike Chamberlain--whether he likes it or not.
B00005JMCT|5.0|No movie in this series compares to American Wedding.  The mixture of romance and sex humor makes this movie very worth watching.  I still laugh like crazy at the \\"grandma ****er scene\\" and the closet scene that provoked it.  This is one of the most classic comedies of all time and definitely something I would require in my movie collection!!!
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This book was an easy, entertaining read. However, I never felt like I got to really know any of the characters well and there were more than a few questions that I had at the end that were never answered. Kind of frustrating. It's a good story for the 'what if' element.
B000022TSW|5.0|This is definitely my favorite comedy of all time.  A combination of extremely irreverent humor, graphic sex jokes, and poking fun at evil.  This movie is epically freaking hilarious!!!  The first time I saw this, I thought I was going to stop breathing I was laughing so hard.  I don't like this show anymore but I will always love this movie, and for anyone who the proper sense of humor, this is a requirement for your collection!!!!
B000002IZM|5.0|Any truly honest movie fan will admit that the Blade Runner soundtrack is without a doubt one of the most memorable and important in movie history. Not since Kubrick's realization of just how important a soundtrack can be to the very meaning of a film (2001: A Space Odyssey) has there been a soundtrack that propels the viewer aurally into the vision made reality intended by the director.<br /><br />Watch the movie, then listen to the soundtrack with your eyes closed and you are transported there...into the dark, gritty, bleak future. Maybe in danger, maybe regretting the loss of life, maybe getting soaked by the cold rain, or maybe feeling the warmth of falling in love... it all depends on which track you're listening to. For this reason alone you should buy this soundtrack.<br /><br />But here are more reasons to purchase this item: CDs are now like Vinyl. They are being replaced by a newer technology; Apps, iTunes, Mp3s, etc. But what is that new technology really? Simply electrical impulses. Think about it. It's not tangible. You can't touch it, hold it or look at it. If your battery dies, it disappears, ceases to exist. Gone.<br /><br />Another reason is that this soundtrack hasn't been in print since 1994 and if you don't get it now, it will only be available to you as an electrical shadow.<br /><br />And the last reason is that this is the BEST price for this brand new item available ANYWHERE. $10 for a treasure like this Can't and Shouldn't be passed up because you WILL regret not getting one when you had the chance. Get it before these few are all gone!<br /><br />It's an opportunity of a lifetime.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Despite the fact I'm hating how far a franchise goes in terms of how they prolong a storyline, I loved this movie.  The end scene after the credits points a fast and furious six which there already commercials for.  The beginning scene was very intense and greatly captured.  I recommend this to all Fast and Furious fans.  It may be a prolonged storyline, but this one is worth it!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this app is a lot of fun.  just like the arcade game,but cheaper!  great for mindless entertainment and stress relief
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Don't know why anyone who loved any of the other Killer's albums WOULDNN'T like this one.  It's not THAT different from the others... just a bit more epic and fresh sounding.  Almost like an entire record with a \\"Dustland Fairytale\\" quality to it, which I love.  Seems like people are disappointed with this release, and I really don't know why, as I think it's wonderful.
0525423656|2.0|I thought Matched was overblown.  Too much hype for an ok YA novel.  Not nearly as good as some of the books it was compared to...just ok.  Crossed was even less than I was expecting.  I felt that Condie had some room for improvement, but she blew it.  It was more boring than the first.  It could have been written as a short story and it would have been good.  I think the publisher was trying to milk too much from the series...just finish it already.  Assuming we are all willing to give the third one a try!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I have to start by saying that I read Reflected in You by Sylvia Day in one day. So clearly, it was a good book for me not to be able to put it down. I have given it 4 stars and Bared to You 3 stars. Had I not read Fifty Shades of Grey first I would have given them each another star. However, there are just too many similarities with characters, setting, back story and plot. Even the main male characters have the same initials they are just transposed. So the only negative I find is originality which plays a big part for me.<br /><br />I think that Ms. Day tells a better story then Ms. James. I also think Ms. Day is more descriptive and isn't repeating the same words/phrases. She does an excellent job at drawing you into the scene.<br /><br />There were a few times I didn't like the way the story went but that is the beauty of being an author. You can write it how you want, so I wouldn't hold that against the review. It is a light read and a steamy page turner.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|We love Iron Man at our house...to get this combo pack at a killer deal was awesome!  It means I can let the kids watch the dvd without worrying that it will get scratched.  It wont' be long until most movies are put out this way.  LOVE IT!
B008FOB2B4|5.0|What happened to the diehard fans of Vangelis? I don't see many reviews for this particular album.<br />Maybe some of the fans thought that this album was a remaster from the original or another one of<br />those compilation works with the same songs we heard already - that was the case with me.<br /><br />I wanted to hear new music and when I saw the cover to \\"Chariots of Fire The Play\\", well I thought<br />it was just another remaster with no new music. Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />Those who love the original soundtrack from 1981 will be pleasantly surprised by the enhanced sound<br />quality, revised music from the original score, and brand new music.<br /><br />Vangelis is an amazing composer whose works span beyond 30 years. His style of music has changed<br />throughout the decades but his brilliance remains intact. In his early years, he relied on his<br />synthesizers to carry out the tunes. Nowadays, he uses trumpets, panpipes, new synthesizers (that<br />serves as background music) and other live instruments to carry his tunes to new levels.<br /><br />I was asking myself how was he going to combine his original recording that relied on synthesizers<br />so much with his new current style of writing? Few artists have that ability to take their piece of<br />art (that is well known and loved such as Chariots of Fire) and make it into something more grandeur<br />or equally close to it - Vangelis is one of those artists.  He did it with the 3CD set of Bladerunner<br />and now looks like he does it again with Chariots of Fire The Play.<br /><br />When I listened to \\"The Play\\", I couldn't help but choke up in tears in a few of his songs because the<br />new music really does reach into your soul. This album not only revisits the familiar tunes from the<br />movie but it greatly ventures off into new territory and new overtures - this feels like a sequel to<br />the movie. It feels so refreshing; it doesn't feel like watching another one of those Hollywood remake<br />movies.<br /><br />\\"Physical Energy\\" is an electrifying fast pace sound. It really does pump you up. You feel like you are<br /> competing  in a relay race.<br /><br />\\"Home in the Glen\\" has that warm tranquil sound that seems to celebrate peace and serenity. The beautiful<br />panpipes (Scottish, I think) takes center stage as the synthesizers play backdrop - it's one of my favorites.<br /><br />\\"Harolds Despair\\" is a remake of Abraham's theme but done beautifully with new synthesizers and soft piano.<br /> It's a delicate piece of art and done with good taste - another one of my favorites.<br /><br />\\"Belief\\" and \\"Ballard\\" also have extraordinary soft tunes that venture off into new territory. One can only<br />imagine what the sequel to this movie would look like with these added new songs.<br /><br />\\"Aspiration\\" has traces from the song Chariots of Fire (that we are familiar with) and has a bombastic<br /> beginning and ending to the song.<br /><br />Probably the most noticeable feeling one gets from listening to this album is that you feel like you are in<br />center stage inside the stadium where the Olympics are held.  You can imagine the crowd cheering for you as<br />you receive your gold metal or even your bronze metal. You can't help but cry. Most of the music carries this<br />emotional message of excellence, love and despair.<br /><br />The album not only celebrates the Olympics with thunderous applause but I believe Vangelis himself was<br />trying to send everyone a message. He wants us to be compassionate beings with a higher level of<br />understanding to overcome society's problems. With everyone cheering (from all walks of life) and<br />holding hands, we can end social injustices, bigotry, and wars by listening to his music. You feel<br />liked a changed person after listening to this album with good intentions.

I also tried going without wheat for a month and have lost 10 pounds! I have tried every diet out there and have spent hundreds of dollar on pills and supplements that just didn't work. Please try it! It works and it all makes sense. You will not be disappointed and there are plenty of other foods to eat!

0062082353|3.0|I read this book with the intention of gaining some insight into ground battle in Iraq and modern sniper craft.  Most of the other books I've read in this vein were from the Vietnam era, and they contained not only that information but also the tempering of time and the understanding of how demoralizing war and killing is.<br /><br />Sadly I was not rewarded with any of the information I was looking for, instead the book shines as an example of how far we have fallen as a society in the expression of Chris Kyle as any sort of \\"hero\\".  Although he claims to be a Christian, this man is nothing more than a heathen thug, a terrible father and husband, and a cold-blooded killer.<br /><br />I think the most telling part of the book was actually nothing that had to do with killing.  In one scene, Kyle describes setting up a hide in a house (the civilians in this given area were \\"escorted out for their own safety\\" aka given three hundred bucks, told their homes no longer belonged to them, and to get the hell out or get killed) and he comes across a Tiger Woods video game that belonged to the former inhabitants.  He stole it.  He admits that he stole it.  He admits that he had no right to take it, it was not his, but he took it anyway.  This basically sums up the entire story of Chris Kyle in a nutshell.<br /><br />He wanted to be a badass killer.  The Iraq War gave him the opportunity to do so.  He hated the Navy - loved being a SEAL, but hated the Navy.  He viewed his fellow sailors as \\"pukes\\" not worthy of his time or attention.  He only joined the Navy to be given the opportunity to be a SEAL, and once he attained that status was happy to divorce himself as much as possible from the organization.<br /><br />As a person, Chris Kyle has no empathy.  He is completely unable to understand situations from any other point of view.  He marries his wife, then leaves her, knocks her up, then leaves her, knocks her up again, and leaves her AND the children.  The only thing that gets him back home at one point when his wife calls is the fact that his daughter is sick, and he was supposed to go home anyway.  It's sickening. Equally sickening is his complete lack of understanding of the people he is fighting, whom he routinely calls \\"savages\\".  He beats on people constantly... in bar fights, in hazing, just because it's Tuesday, whatever, he's a SEAL! Nobody's going to give him trouble.<br /><br />This guy was not a sniper.  Yeah, I said it.  He was in close combat in a protected position, literally shooting fish in a barrel like it was nothing.  It BORED him, that's why he inserted himself into the house-to-house searches because picking off poorly armed, hopped up, undereducated insurgents was too easy.  He had no technique.  By his own admission he only had two long shots, both lucky.<br /><br />Deeply disappointing from a character standpoint.  As a book it lacked in continuity in places and lacked detail in particular.  The authors obviously felt they could ride the coattails of previous works in this area without producing a work of merit.  A better protagonist would have been my first change.
0767847431|5.0|This is another movie we hadn't seen. I loved the \\"dancing\\" statue of Kali. It is a very good movie and I would recommend it to my friends and I would tell them to purchase it through Amazon.com.<br />When I ordered it, it was shipped out right away. And the pricing is very good. It can be ordered new or previously owned. [[ASIN:0767847431 The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]

0525953728|4.0|\\"No easy day\\" is a book about Navy seals and training involved. Along the way the capture and killing of Osama Bin Laden. The book contains a lot of military gorgon and overall a decent read. It reflects overall the sacrifices the military men and women make,like leaving family and friends,no holidays at home and trying to adjust to life after being a combat soldier ready and willing to fight for your country at a moments notices. Trying to adjust to life after military without the \\"high\\" of ready for combat at seconds notice.

B008FSCNTK|1.0|I have really tried to listen to this album, but it just doesn't speak to me like Diana's earlier work.  When I'm playing the tracks on my iPod in the train, I'm really conscious of displaying the cover to my fellow passengers.  What was she thinking? Like the opinions of other reviewers, this album is more miss than hit, which is a real disappointment. I've loved her earlier arrangements of classic jazz tunes, but this album just doesn't have the continuity or connection that she has achieved before.  A missed opportunity.
0316228532|1.0|Seldom have I ever been so disappointed with a book.  I have read and re-read all of the Harry Potter books and I guess I was expecting a book of their quality.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  I have been privileged to teach for 44 years and also serve as librarian.  I bought this book because my high school readers were wanting more J. K. Rowling.  Before I got past page 14 in the book, I had to mark out copious inappropriate words.  Young people are exposed to inappropriate sights, sounds and words in their lives.  They absolutely do not need to see them in the works of a beloved author.  Shame on you, J. K. Rowling.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book does not dissapoint! I loved hearing more about Annabeth, and how she thinks. The only thing I wish...is that it was longer. The book isn't rushed...but they are always so short. So much happens in this book, and there is always a hurry to get things accomplished, that it seems like the poor demigods can never a break & catch their breath. Because of this, you don't always get an IN DEPTH POV from the character, but must rely on info from previous books. I do agree w/ another poster that Piper kinda got shortchanged in this book, & I wished they would have had more from Aphrodite. She was entertaining. Sadly, with 7 demigods...it's gonna happen every now and then.<br />Overall, another great story, & with the ending how it was...I can't wait for the next one!
B001NLKT60|4.0|I found the book difficult to get started.  Very wordy and it took a few chapters to get into the story.  Not really exciting in the beginning.  However once you get past, I would say a third of the story, it starts to liven up.  From then on I really liked it and wanted to keep reading and find out what actually happened.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What struck me about this novel was how Collins had achieved what most aspiring authors and even accomplished authors cannot achieve. That is a simple straightforward story that is filled with powerful symbolism and potent imagination.
B000KRN67C|5.0|I've always considered Rotting Christ to be one of my favorite bands(albeit in a very large pile), but they've ranged from just good to superb over the years. Thy Mighty contract would have to be my favorite with Theogonia sandwhiched comfortably in between that and Triarchy of the Lost lovers. I own A Dead Poem and Genesis also which are quite good. I've sampled some others which were just meh.<br />I have to say that this one didn't take many spins to win me over, and over the last five years or so it would have to be one of the two or three best albums I've heard along with I's Between Two Worlds. It's Rotting Christ reinventing themselves in yet another tight form like the aforementioned faves, but it has so much dynamic and inspiration (which apparently is entirely to the credit of Sakis this time around). The first two tracks reminded me of earlier At the Gates material like \\"Primal Breath\\" or \\"Blood of the Sunsets\\" with the twin guitar lines weaving and dueling each other in supple force. The rest are just memorable and diverse and all around excellent. It feels like a lot of effort went into getting this one right. Highly recommend.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book and since I couldn't put it down I finished it in 4 hours! I would of loved to read this type of book as a child in school fortunately for me I have a kindle and as an adult bought it for myself to enjoy! Of course it is an easy read but at the core, it was a heartwarming story filled with unforgettable characters that develop a sense of realism all on their own. It actually had me crying and smiling while picturing the entire story in my head! The point of the view as the child with the deformity, Auggie, was really engaging and although I thought the whole book would be from his perspective, I wasn't disappointed with the way they gave a voice to some of the other important people in Auggie's life. It was really entertaining finding out how all of them came to be the way they ending up being! Trying not to spoil too much!!! Anyways, I really was in the mood for this type of book and I absolutely was not disappointed.
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day is on my must read list! I could not put it down. Well written and enjoyable to read. I was looking for some dirt on Obama, but there wasn't any really. Hope that Mark writes more.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I thought maybe someone else had written this book compared to the first one. But probably Sylvia Day succumbed to making a quick turnaround buck after the success of the first novel.  This book is filled with lots of erotic sex but no real development of the characters or storyline.  It's so frustrating to think that Gideon would  cut her out of his life and plans and not confide in her.  And unbelievable that she would accept it.  The author missed a great chance to develope her characters and their relationship more fully.  This book is boring, frustrating and just didn't draw me into caring about the people the way the first one did.  So disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of those books than keep you reading for more..Very entertaining and easy read.Once you started you feel like you must read the whole book at once ..
0525953728|5.0|This was a very interesting book, about how our Navy Seals put their lives in danger for us. The true story of how it went. It would be a wonderful book for the people to read and understand what our Military does to keep us safe.

B001VNB54A|5.0|The Pacific was America's war and that theater is much ignored now. It wasn't always like this, but it has been since our next Far East war and that means there are very few accurate and well-crafted representations of what the Greatest Generation endured and achieved in the Pacific theater. By the time they got home the parades were over, but their heroism and determination should never be forgotten. This is the finest accurate recreation of real stories and real achievements of real heroes that you're likely to ever find. World Wars are fading from memory and are being displaced by myths; this is no myth--this is history. Get it; watch it. Semper Fi, Marines.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|DISAPPOINTED!!  I loved book 1 Bared to You, I would've given it 10 stars! It was well written, a great storyline, and well developed characters.  I could barely put it down.  Book 2 I found myself skipping through paragraphs hoping that it had to get better. So depressing! Ugghh, I waited months for this to come out.  It was so repetitive: get in fight, makeup sex, fight 'your lying to me', then more sex. SPOILER - The storyline had such great potential with Nathan, but he was dead before we knew anything even happened.  Then the details get explained in 2 pages AND worst of all, why is Eva fine with premeditated murder?????
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Pink has done it again, and this cd is filled with a bunch of hits. \\"Just Give Me a Reason,\\" \\"Try\\" and \\"Great Escape\\" are worth mentioning! It's no wonder that this cd went number 1.
B00846REIS|3.0|The book is so close to Fifty Shades of Gray that it is like reading them all over again. Of course names are changed and roommate's gender preferences have changed. But the same basic story. I have not finished yet, so it may have a \\"surprise ending\\". But, I believe I know where it is going.

B0098VXMNE|5.0|Blood, guts, and raunchy hump scenes. What else can you ask for in a series about gladiators? The homo scenes were too many -1 is too much.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|this book is so inspiring for anyone who does creative work. love the way he writes--casual and funny, like he's talking to a friend. love the practical tips and ideas too.<br /><br />it makes a great gift for artists or writers. also, i'd recommend buying the hard copy instead of the ebook. the look and feel affect the way you read this book.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|This is a very convenient collection.  I started at the beginning and have been reading through for the past several months.  It's fascinating to observer Conan Doyle's subtle changes in writing style as I progress thought the series.  I'm surprised to find that I prefer the earlier works.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is entertaining &amp; totally worth downloading. Plus the graphics are beautiful. The only thing I didn't like was that it was to short.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Having been a lover of classic horror stories & movies as a kid & having read Shelley's Frankenstein in print some time ago, I felt compelled to take advantage of Stoker's Dracula on audio. I wanted to know what was behind all the movies. At times I found it heavy going because of the style, but I am glad that I persevered. I recommend it, but prospective readers should be prepared for the diary/letter style as well as the language of the day. Take your time & I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I watch season 1 on telly but found it was boring, even though I did enjoy the show.

Watched season 2 opening and some thing don't make any sense at all from the end of season 1.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|Super easy to program, you can re-set buttons on the fly so you don't have to shut the game down and restart it.  The display DOESNT show your character stats though so don't be sold on that.  It feels great, the buttons are quiet and contoured perfectly.  I do wish the head of the analog stick was a little bigger.  It's got a GREAT weight to it, it's not cheaply made AT ALL.  You can load three different presets for control layouts and choose them on the fly as well with the press of 1 button.  This thing even gets news updates it's such a beast!!!!  Im not kidding about that either, it ACTUALLY gets news updates and with the press of a button you can view that news article in your web browser.  EPIC WIN
B0099G4Y26|4.0|Love this whole album.  It's fun and heartfelt.  You can tell she wrote these songs from real experiences.  So glad I bought it.

0805095535|3.0|I have wanted to read all of Paul Auster's books, including Winter Journal. When the word \\"winter\\" is in the title, then I expect something about the \\"winter of life,\\" meaning, of course, life in the older years, let's say, 77-88??? (For those people who are not aware of this, and are perhaps too young to hear this, then take care of these words: it is not fun to be older knowing what will happen in a few years). Well, Auster at 65 is hardly in this category of old or older age, in my opinion. Usually I remember whole books when an author such as Auster writes, but I hardly remember this book, except that I feel that his other books are better than this one. Auster gave us in his book snippets from his life, but why are we interested, except to find some value in the kind of life he lived. I did not find universal themes, so sorry to say. Mr.Auster, please forgive this unpleasant review: I hope that other people like the book and recommend it to others. Nancy S
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Overall just great. The packaging is one of the best ive ever seen. Not too thick either, about the size of two dvd cases put together
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I was looking forward to another jazz standard album from Diana - maybe something with the energy and jump of Stepping Out (one of my all time favorite albums from any artist). At first I was disappointed, but I love Diana's music so much and respect her as a musician, that I've decide to listen to some more and to hear what she's trying to say in the music. And it's growing on me. The bottom line is that Diana has earned my trust, and so while this collection is different than I was hoping for, I'm willing to let Diana try on some different sounds. My initial review would have been five stars. After a few more listens, I'm giving this five stars.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Another good book by Lee Child, a bit of the same old stuff, nothing new really but still the same good old Jack. I'll be buying the next one.

B002NPY7FE|4.0|Did you know that Stephen King's screenplay adaptation was canned outright? Seems stupid, right, telling the author of the work that is being produced as a major motion picture to sod off? Well, sticks and stones and glass houses and whatnot, 'cause this adaptation was creepy, endearing, and just a bit tragic.<br /><br />The film goes without the supernatural elements of the novel, but it does a great job insinuating that it is still present. Cujo's actors (the cast and crew seem unable to provide an actual count of the Saint Bernards in the film) presented a somewhat Hulk-ish mentality to annoyance v. destruction mode: loud noises, crying, etc pains Cujo, and he attacks. And we feel sympathy for the devil-dog.<br /><br />The BD presentation is great; I couldn't not believe the restored visual elements (a bit too restored, as I could easily see that Cujo was played by multiple dogs). It is a scenic, almost idyllic vista for the film... until the horror actually gets started, of course. I must too admit, I forgot how great the jarring soundtrack shocked you from tame to fangs. The 5.1 track is great, especially during the pivotal scene where Cujo attacks the car for what became a three-day siege. We are treated to a series of featurettes focusing on various elements of the film (called appropriately Dog Days) which recall the cast and crew's favourite moments during the arduous filming process.<br /><br />Fans of King's work probably already know all the praises of this, one of his better loved stories. And of course, who DOESN'T know who King is in the first place. If you don't, grab this BD (which a quite affordable upgrade from the standard DVD), and get to watching this seminal horror film. You've got some catching up to do, but I dare say you'll enjoy it!
1567184855|5.0|This was a fantastic book that will open your mind about who you really are and what our purpose in life is.  A must read for anyone searching for themselves.
0061726834|5.0|The beautiful, striking book cover catches your eye immediately on the bookshelf, standing out as something most original and unique. I adore the young-adult genre that is so diverse, where the sky is literally the limit when it comes to writer's creativity and imagination hence Delirium by Lauren Oliver did not disappoint. I was unable to put this book down once I had begun to read, as I plunged into the most intensely gripping and captivating story that had me hooked. Emotive, poignant and stirring, this moving tale touches your soul by making a window into your heart for all to see. The world that the author creates is so realistic and authentic, that you cannot help but believe more in the main character and the story as a whole. Thoroughly exciting, the electric tension and suspense can be felt through the pages and those words that jump off the page at you. Romantic to the core this beautiful and captivating love story is one that I truly fell for, hence it shall always remain buried deep within my heart.<br />Delirium is set in a vision of the near future in a parallel United States of America, where Scientists have found a cure for love. Eighteen year olds can undergo a procedure and get cured of love, that one powerful emotion that shapes the course of our lives. The main character Lena Haloway is extremely excited at this revelation and can't wait for her treatment, as what could be better than a life with no pain? But then a few weeks before her treatment Lena does something that will risk everybody around her, as she then falls in love.<br />What defines a great book compared to just a good one, is something that the reader can connect to in a personal and intimate way, in which they can relate and empathize with the characters in the story thus the comparisons are between the words and the reader are noticeable to each person. I was able to understand those feelings expressed by the main character; hence the words meant more to me than in any other fictional work, that being very meaningful and special.I was so impressed by an author who has not only surpassed but exceeded all expectations, by producing something of such outstanding caliber that is incredible. Distinctive and matchless Delirium was an outstanding first book in a series that I cannot wait to explore and continue. It makes one really think about love, as I am constantly amazed by how this one emotion alters and defines our lives; it is very powerful. Fans of the Twilight series by Stephanie Myer and other romantic Young Adult fictional work (i.e. the Lharmell series by Rhiannon Hart or the immortal devices by Cassandra Claire), will absolutely love and devour this book. Fast-paced and action packed you are kept guessing throughout whilst the momentum is maintained, thus I continued to read wanting to find out more. I have added before I fall and the sequel to Delirium, Pandemonium to my list of books that I must read, for now I want to continue reading Lauren Oliver's works.ional work, that being very meaningful and special.I was so impressed by an author who has not only surpassed but exceeded all expectations, by producing something of such outstanding caliber that is incredible.

0307341577|4.0|If you liked \\"Gone Girl,\\" you like this one too. It's a great read, told in the same \\"back and forth in time\\" perspective as \\"Gone Girl,\\" and with just as many twists and surprises. It's much better than \\"Sharp Objects,\\" Flynn's first novel (which is okay -- but this is better!).

1590171993|5.0|This book has been praised in the highest possible terms. The critic Morris Dickstein called it ' a perfect novel'. I do not know what this could possibly mean but I do agree that this is a very admirable work. It is slow-paced and written in a clear understandable language. It tells the life- story of an admirable character, the son of poor farmers who makes it to being a dedicated teacher of the Classics, a lifelong member of the academic world. His life however is filled with disappointments including an unhappy marriage, a daughter who is lovable and supportive as a child, but who gets lost, no small part due to the manipulative activity of her mother. Stoner is a hard worker whether on the farm as a child or as a student or teacher. He is dedicated earnest serious as the book itself is. It is without humor. There is a short time of consolation and beauty in the life of Stoner when he has a love- affair with a young graduate- student who shares his values and world. University gossip however forces her to leave, and he does not hear from her until years later he sees that her single book has appeared and has been dedicated to him. There are quiet moving moments in the work. And the dignity and integrity of Stoner are made apparent throughout. He is a good man who has had a difficult and in many ways disappointing life, but also a life which has had its richness and rewards, its moments of beauty and love.<br />An admirable book about an admirable character.

B00846REIS|4.0|Steamy like 50 Shades but with more of a storyline and more complex characters. I would definitely recommend and can't wait to read the next installment. Would have given 5 stars but the end was a little lacking...I understand this is to leave an opening for the next book but still a let down...

B000XR4OC0|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with these shoes.  Some people seem to really dislike them but I couldn't be happier.  I wear Sanuk shoes religiously and I was very hesitant to switch to TOMS.  I bought these a week before a trip because I needed a casual walking shoe (I hate wearing sneakers for anything but exercising).  I love that they come in a half size (I wear a 6.5 and 7 is usually way too big for me).  I wore these shoes for the entire week I was walking around all of Chicago and my feet felt so good.  I've been wearing them to work too and I couldn't be happier.  It didn't take long at all to break them in...and even then it's not like I had any foot pain.  A great cause, a super comfy shoe, and they are so adorable.  I even received compliments on them at the airport. :) Excited to get more colors!
B005LAII1C|5.0|I don't know about you, but when I go to see a \\"funny\\" movie... I'm not looking for reality or smart jokes that don't offend peoples way of life. I have people in my family that are from other countries, gay, educated, very religious and that unfortunately have cancer. I was happy to finally be able to laugh at those kind of real life situations. Seth is a comedic genius. How can a movie about a trash talking teddy bear be funny? I actually expected less and got a story about friendship and relationships, along with a few twists that made the movie more memorable. Seriously love this movie and hold it up there with Dumb and Dumber, which I think is one of the most hilarious movies. And No, I don't live in my Moms basement and/or smoke pot. Even my wife who is from South Korea and my Sister who is a lesbian... from Boston... thought it was hilarious! Some of these people thinking this is an uncultured insult need to look in the mirror and make fun of themselves. This movie is making fun of American culture more than anything. I find myself still quoting lines from it and cant wait to own it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put the down down.  I finished the book in less than 24 hours.  I was so involved in the book I was at lunch and scream out NO from behind my desk...I am so glad it picked up right where she left off in Bared to you..I will not spoil it for others but the ending left me wanting more and I cannot wait for book 3. The drive to NC was unbelievable and down right HOT. It was nice to see how Gideon never gave up on Eva and their relationship.  As screwed up as both of them are at the end of the day everyone wants to be in love even a character in a book.  I felt so bad for Gideon when he finally told Eva about his past and I loved the fact that Eva decided to do her own research. Gideon just wanted to protect Eva at any cost and he did. Love it!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Being a fan of the author's previous works, I was very excited to get my hands on this book.  That being said, I read the book description and reviews and didn't really like the way the book sounded.  I got the book anyway and was pleasantly surprised.  The description and reviews do NOT do this book justice.  It is so much more fun, exciting and demented than how it is described.  I dare to say this is Flynn's best book yet, and that's saying a lot considering I absolutely love her other works. As one who always reads reviews before purchasing books, I'm going to tell others to just buy the book. Don't even bother with the reviews! I want to say what the book is about, but I feel like any way I do, it will contain spoilers, so I will try to stay as vague as possible.<br /><br />I would classify this book as a psychological thriller. The book focuses on a married couple, Nick and Amy Dunne.  Nick and Amy appear as though they are made for each other.  On their five year wedding anniversary, Amy suddenly disappears.  Nick is the prime suspect and then all the twists and turns one can expect from Flynn come into play.<br /><br />I couldn't help but think about the Scott Peterson case and Nancy Grace while reading this book.  You can tell some influence was there!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I wish more versions were available for download. I teach a group of children aged 5-12. We use ALOT of different versions. However my church is small and doesn't have an availabe connection. Therefore that fact alone really renders my kindle fire USELESS in the classroom. So I'll just continue to carry 4 (or more)Bibles to church. Otherwise, it's good for home use...leaves alot to be desired though. I guess one does get what one pays for.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Snow white and the Huntsman is a perfect example when hollywood runs out of projects, The storyline is not the best it could have been. Kristen played her part well but you find yourself wanting the movie to end.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|I'm a big soa fan. probably because i have been around that lifestyle and some of the stories. I find myself counting the days until the next episode. But to the writers I say be warned you are turning the club into a bunch of snitches and backstabbers. your taking the brotherhood and honor away and thats what makes the show so powerful.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Although the quality of writing isn't the best, I have to admit that the content makes up for it. All three books have kept me up late at night and 'hot & bothered'. I run an adult forum and I have a few members who engage in this lifestyle and I have often struggled to understand why people would turn to bondage (and all the extras)to enhance their sex life. These books have given me a greater understanding of what is often considered taboo.

B008EZVNO0|5.0|Since I've been in my early adolescence the arrival of a new Van Morrison album into the family home was a very happy event. I've tended to think of Van Morrison as one of those bardic musical figures that,if your able to let his music into your life,will reward you with much to savor,hum to and often think about. One thing about him that always entranced me is not merely that he devoted himself to a very distinct musical vision. But also that he's chosen the genres of soul,jazz and blues music to do so. And all the while being very highly respected by the rock community. Well he's always been there,on the road and in the studio. Even during years when the music industry was collapsing he stuck with it. And here is Van Morrison,back again and giving us his art new and improved as always.<br /><br />  \\"Open The Door To Your Heart\\" is a tremendous opening,full of heavy organ styled Memphis soul and begins the recurring theme of the album. This finds Van Morrison clarifying his long standing viewpoint on art sacrificed for commerce. He brings the same flavor to \\"Mystic Of The East\\",though on this occasion again in search of spiritual redemption. The 8+ minute \\"Goin Down To Monte Carlo\\" is a scintillating jazzy groove with Van travelling to relax but being annoyed by hearing \\"some phony pseudo jazz\\". That same musical ethic and attitude shows up again on \\"End Of The Rainbow\\",\\"Retreat And View\\" and,on a somewhat darker note on \\"In Money We Trust\\". The title song,something of an anthem for his life and career as well as \\"Pagan Heart\\" are both in the pocket electric blues. Van sings all of these songs very directly and with more of a strong growl than his usual bluesy,John Lee Hooker style stuttering. \\"Close Enough For Jazz\\" is..well Van in a very jazzy mode not coming in vocally until near the songs end from some appropriately spontaneous vocals.<br /><br />  The album closes with the hard and heavy soul stomp of \\"Educating Archie\\",lyrically the song that ties this entire album together with it's tale of a man fed on a TV diet of essentially \\"celebrities as news and news as entertainment\\". He than asks what happened to the individual after he gave up his rights. In this setting of rich soul/blues/jazz Van Morrison poetically addresses some very realistic concerns. I suppose some might say his lyrics here might be whinny and even angry. But his delivery and lyrical phrasing deliver them perfectly with his music. And his message is so stop on,it goes right into the blues spirit of making the listener feel better and not worse regarding their inner conflicts. This is in every sense another winning album from...well a man known for delivering many winning albums. And it's very happy to hear after all these years Van Morrison is still delivering music from his soul,and with soul with authority.album together with it's tale of a man fed on a TV diet of essentially \\"celebrities as news and news as entertainment\\".

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book.  Imaginative and well written.  A bargain-of-the-century price as well.  Will definitely be watching for further great offerings from this author!
B000002I2M|5.0|Changling, a malcontented sprite which is left in the place of normal infants by fairie folk. Damn if this song doesn't say it all in a twentieth century way. I like the other songs,too; but this one touched my heart. So, I immediately loved the whole blues/jazz/rock driven monster of an album. \\"But I've never been so broke that I couldn't leave town...see me change, change, see me change\\". Clever speaking in Code. JM may have batted for both teams. No? Well, I can dream, can't I? \\"I've been Uptown, I've been Downtown, I've been all around....I had money, then I had none\\".
1476712042|5.0|Abby and Travis don't have the most conventional of relationships.  Travis is your typical bad boy. That is, until Abby came along.  Abby is trying her hardest to find a guy that gets her away from her past, but that's impossible from the moment she meets Travis Mad-Dog Maddox.  She tries to convince herself that he is not what she is looking for, but at the end of the day, he can make her smile when no one else can. Travis knows he wants to really know Abby from the moment he saw her at one of his fights; not as one of his one-night-stands, but as something more.  Abby gets Travis to see life in a new perspective.<br /><br />Now, the summary given is a little misleading, at least in my opinion.  Yes, Abby is a good girl, but not the kind that the summary makes you picture.  When I read that at first, I didn't want to read the book because it seemed too \\"eh\\" but after reading so many great reviews I finally gave in and LOVED it.  Abby does drink and Abby does swear. So, I'm not sure where that came from, but she's still good, at least compared to Travis.<br /><br />Now, the characters.  They're all so fantastic. Shep and Finch are two of my favorites. They're both so caring and likable; they're the good friends you're glad to have.  Now, when I read that Abby's best friend is named America, I thought I wouldn't like her. It turns out, though, that she's fantastic. She cares about Abby unbelievably.  Abby. She's great, really.  Sometimes, she got on my nerves- like when she left poor Parker a billion and three times for Travis. Poor guy.  Otherwise, I loved her.  Now, onto Travis. Truthfully, sometimes he creeped me out.  I think Kara was right when she mentions that he's a little to obsessed. It's a good obsession though. I guess love can do that to a guy.<br /><br />The book could have ended halfway through.  When I thought I was finished, my kindle told me there was still 50% of the book left.  I wondered what the hell else could happen and thought maybe it'll just drag. I was wrong.  It was great and captivating.<br /><br />This is a book I do recommend for people that love romances, especially ones that travel along a rocky road.<br />4.5/5 stars!
0061726834|5.0|\\"Before scientists found the cure, people thought love was a good thing.\\"<br /><br />  Once you fall in love, you've caught the disease. You think differently, you act differently, and nothing is right.  Luckily, once you turn eighteen, you can receive the cure. You'll live a perfectly predictable, normal life. Before eighteen, you're on your own. The cure can't work on someone that young, the side effects could be devastating.<br /><br />At first, Lena Holoway couldn't wait until the day she'd finally receive the cure to \\"Amor Deliria Nervosa\\". But after encountering a few out-of-the-ordinary circumstances, she starts to think differently.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver created such a unique and well-written story. Delirium had me hooked from the first page. I wanted to learn more about Lena's society; how it functions, what the people are like, and how life can go on without love. I felt like the whole thing could actually happen. Love as a disease? at first you'd think \\"no way\\". But with the explanations given in the handbook, it's plausible, and coming up with the idea for it just shows Lauren Oliver's creativity.<br /><br />  I love Lena. She's so sweet and seemingly oblivious to what love really is. In the beginning her thought process and how she considers the strong emotion are awesome.  When she figures it out.. well, I'll let you see what happens.<br /><br />  I can never say enough how much I love books like this- set in the future with an alternate way of life, completely different from our own. A creative mind is needed to make something unique and outside the box, and Delirium fits this completely.<br />5/5 stars. Definitely.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Book kept me very interested.  I finished it in less than a week.  Lots of twists and I liked hearing first person account from the two main characters.  I have recommended this book to friends.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|A classic science fiction movie, I think. Existential as well as very imaginative. Allows for questions like who am I, WHAT am I, and what REALLY exists. But if I were you, I wouldn't go jumping off the roofs of skyscrapers. That would be irrational because you MIGHT end up in a place worse than the one you're presently in.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|if i could give this -1 star i would,the way everyone was going on about it i thought it must have been the 2nd coming or something, boy was i wrong, save your money, go see a movie, read the bible, grow tomatoes,compose a ballad, anything, just don't bother with this book. it's like a teenager trying to write an erotic novel with a dictionary, very hard to read and i even flicked forward thinking it might get better, but i couldn't get past the first chapter and when i moved forward it wasn't any better.it's badly written, it's got a bad plot (sorry no plot) it's simply an erotic novel  trying to hide behind a bad story line like they used to in mens porno movies in the 70's. it's trash don't bother.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I start playing this game and I can't put it down! I love the challenge this game provides on many levels.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I had read one of the author's articles about this same topic in Men's Health years ago and enjoyed it but never researched it more until about a month ago when a family member started speaking about the book. I immediately downloaded the ebook and began reading. The more I read the more I enjoyed it. Forget the tall tales and hyperbole, the last several chapters had me sold on why running should be, and is, such a natural thing to do. The book has inspired me and made me want a better me.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was just what I expected.<br /> I love BigFish games! The graphics are eye catching, the story lines are interesting, something always makes me jump, and the game part holds me by not being too hard or easy.
B0058YPL66|4.0|Once Upon a Time is one of the best new shows on TV. The first season captured a lot of memories of stories from childhood with a different twist. I Am sure the next season will be just as good. I wish the would have had out takes on the DVD.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a former Army officer I found this first-hand account of the mission that killed Bin Laden to be utterly fascinating.  The detailed description of the amazing training and courage that these elite special forces men possess is a great testament to this nations armed forces, the greatest the world has ever seen.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Once again a great and exciting read. As always Follett captures you and you must keep reading.<br />SAD THAT WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR FOR THE FINAL.
B009CPIR9K|1.0|I can only describe this movie as a comedy without laughs. Do not waste your money on this, even the Resident Evil movies are better. Uwe Boll could probably make a better movie than this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book. Lots of fun. Lots of tears. Over all it definitely earned all five stars. It's a must read!
B008Y7GPY6|1.0|Even Reynold's usual quality performance did nothing to help this loser of a movie.  I won't add anything that will make this review a spoiler, but will say everything about it is totally unrealistic.  A standard, old fashioned Zippo style lighter burns almost constantly through the movie without adding fuel?  The cell phone battery which is almost dead from the beginning never dies?  He wastes time calling his home to hear his son's recorded voice on voice-mail, instead of seeking help with the phone that supposedly has limited battery life?  Ditto a call to his mother who is in a nursing home?  People he contacts on the phone are more interested in where he is than in listening to his problem?  Those are just of few of many impossible happenings.  If you're looking for realism be sure to pass on this bomb.  I stuck around to see how it ended, but other than that, a real waste of time.  Too bad Ryan is even linked with this movie. He had to have done it just for the money; a real shame.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Clever, creative, captivating<br />Can't stop turning pages<br /><br />They say i need more words to complete this review<br />Love the kindle fire hd
B008FDP7AW|5.0|I thought God and Guns was good, but Last of a Dying Breed just might be the best Skynyrd release to date. There are a few songs that could have been left off (i.e. the ones about how some woman gets them turned on - kinda doesn't seem appropriate for guys of their age to be singing about), but the rest are really strong, musically and lyrically. Ready to Fly is excellent, and very touching considering how much personal loss the band has endured over the years. Johnny's vocals are superb on every song. Now, if they would just get their act together on the Confederate flag and quit cow-towing to political correctness, everything would be perfect. Long live Dixie!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An excellent read -- eager for Follett's final book of the trilogy.  HE has kept all the lives of the families going strong; and his historical research of the historical events is his strength,
0525953728|5.0|There was no way this book breached our National Security.  Thanks, Mark, for having the guts to publish this book after all the flak you received from the Pentagon and our current administration.<br /><br />No way did Barack Hussein Obama take down Osama Bin Laden ; you professionals put your lives on the line and did the job that you were trained for.  GOD BLESS THE SEALS!
B009KUANWG|5.0|While Daniel Craig made an impressive debut as James Bond in \\"Casino Royale,\\" the film, like its successor, \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" didn't have a memorable theme in the tradition of the franchise.  The last really good Bond opening theme song was the brilliant \\"The World is Not Enough,\\" performed by Garbage.<br /><br />The producers of the upcoming \\"Skyfall\\" were wise to have Adele belt out the theme song.  The singer has the power of Shirley Bassey, the soul of Gladys Knight, and the throaty sexiness of Tina Turner, all women that sang some of the best themes in the series.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" also manages to interpolate some of the original James Bond theme in the background, making this an outstanding composition.<br /><br />'Can't wait to hear the song on the big screen in the opening credits.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I liked it better than Gone Girl!  Definitely suspenseful and creepy - couldn't put it down.  Looking forward to reading her other novels.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun game! Really great at only 99 cents. Lots of objects to find and puzzles to solve. I am definitely looking forward to the next one.
0345803485|1.0|My God!!! Gag me with a spoon (and with my sensitive gag reflex I vomit).<br /><br />I didn't buy this book. I downloaded the ebook \\"sample\\" just to see the hype. The sample gave me the first few chapters.<br /><br />This was the WORST writing I have Ever seen. There was no doubt to the why on this book being rejected as a 'Twilight' fan-fiction. It's not just bad writing but horrible character development. And the ridiculous repeated bogus words was terrible. Even a thesaurus couldn't help this let alone a editor. No wonders on the author resorting to self publishing.<br /><br />Everything was all tell. Telling me about the character's looks and feelings instead of showing.<br /><br />Show not tell.<br /><br />If you have to tell a description of the character in two pages (easily skip-able) then you've failed.<br /><br />If you have to let the reader know verbally through the character's talk what they feel then you've failed.<br /><br />But I suppose this works for the less educated.
B008OTTSX4|4.0|The problem with covers is that the bands covering it need to be better than the original or inject something original. The Rush tributes like 'Working Man' are the worst examples of how this goes wrong - the musicians are totally competent, but the covers are soulless (perhaps because they're not used to working with each other) and certainly no better than the original, so why bother?<br /><br />That said, on this tribute album most of the artists are extremely talented, mesh well, and are obviously having fun. In general I just have a blast listening to this even though I've endlessly listened to a huge quantity of the live CDs and bootlegs. This is my favorite studio Purple album, and both 'Lazy' and 'Maybe I'm a Leo' are in contention for my favorite songs of all time, so I think I've got some fairly high standards here.<br /><br />Standouts for me are Sanata doing 'Smoke on the Water', Chickenfoot and Steve Vai on 'Highway Star', Hughes on 'Maybe I'm a Leo', and especially Joe Bonmassa on 'Lazy'. I'd never heard of this guy before, but I can feel the passion on 'Lazy', which is perhaps my favorite Purple song on my favorite album, so I'm definitely going to give his other stuff a listen.<br /><br />Slightly disappointing are Iron Maiden on 'Highway Star' (I like them in general, but it really feels like they're phoning it in) and Flaming Lips on 'Smoke on the Water'. I like the Flaming Lips, especially 'Yoshimi' in Quadraphonic, and I technically I can appreciate this cover, but this is a fun high energy CD and then this song just completely kills the momentum halfway through. Everyone's having a blast doing their favorite Machine Head tracks, and this just clinically dissects their most popular song. It's completely out of place. If anything, it should be a bonus track at the end.<br /><br />So, in the end, while I can endlessly listen to studio and live versions of Blackmore, Glover, Gillan, Lord, and Paice it's refreshing to hear other excellent bands havefun with my favorite album of all time. Just a few missteps keep this from five stars, but if you love the original it is completely worth the ninebux.
0316228532|1.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book and so disappointed in the content.<br />I am not interested in teenage angst, such as masterbation or getting an erection<br />from the vibrations of the school bus.<br /> I cannot stand the way these teens speak to adults.<br />I did not like the story line.  For me, this is not entertainment.  If I wanted someone<br />preaching morals I'd go to church.  I found the Adults distasteful and shallow.<br />I will not be pre-ordering any more of her books.  I will make sure I read the reviews first.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|I truly believe that The Shield is one of the greatest works of art ever put onto film.  I'd place it right alongside The Godfather and 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Many people have compared the Shield to Shakespeare's Macbeth and Richard the Third.  It has also been said, that unlike most television Dramas, the Shield, in its entirety, has a three act structure, with key events happening in the lives of the characters that completely change the dynamic of the show.  I'd have to choose the final season as my favorite, and I also consider the series finale to be the best season finale I've ever seen.  You must watch this show all the way to the final episode.  If you were to stop short of the end, you really would not understand it completely.  Everything that happens in these characters' lives culminates in the final few episodes.  Two days ago, I watched the final episode again.  I've watched the entire series, front to back, twice already, so nothing that happens in the story comes as a surprise anymore.  Despite this fact, when the episode finished, I just sat there, overwhelmed, and almost in shock.  I think my reaction was due to the fact that I was taken aback by the sheer quality of this show, and by the degree in which it affected my life.  The fact that a show this great exists is almost a miracle.
0525953728|5.0|Loved this book. easy read. very interesting. i would recommend it to anyone. the accounts make you feel like you are right there with the seals.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have to say I am very sad this is the end of the books.  I got so caught up in these books, all three of them.  The two main characters became a part of my thoughts during the day.  I could not wait to go home and start reading again.<br />This series was recommended to me by several of my friends and they were so right.  I would recommend these books to most anyone who truly loves to read.  PS I love my Kindle!!!!
B008OQRULO|5.0|I'm not the target audience for this show (male and over 30) but I love it! It's like a hybrid of the 'Scream' movies and a classic soap opera like 'Peyton Place.' The acting may be questionable at times (ahem, Keegan Allen) and the costume designers need to reign it in (why does Spencer always dress like she's 40?) but the writing is spot on. I find myself watching and thinking \\"Okay, I know where this is going because I've seen it a hundred times,\\" and then it spins in some completely different, unexpected direction. If you've read the so-so books, you'll be surprised at how the TV production has taken the basic characters and structure and vastly improved on them. Highly recommended!
0525953728|5.0|Great book with lots of interesting information and clearly factual. The only negative in my mind is that the author did in fact break the code of silence on discussing missions. If he does indeed donate the proceeds to charities that would make up for it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is easy to use and it gives all the information that I need regarding the weather where I am.  I like the maps because you can figure out pretty easily if a storm is coming and allows you to prepare.

B004CFBMRY|5.0|Before reading this book my opinion on running has always been that its unnatural to run because animals don't run. The chill under trees or they run for their lives.<br />Now I understand that running is one of the most natural and pure ways of expressing what we are. That it is something that makes us unique and explains a great deal of what we are.<br /><br />The book is expertly written. By the time I got half way I had already bought myself some minimalist running shoes. Fantastic.
0345803485|4.0|I agree with the repetition and the not so great writing. But its a great escape. I find the book very entertaining and arousing. Anyone who doesnt..must need a better sex life.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Well, I've been looking forward to reading this since finishing Bared to You.  I had to wait to start it until I finished the other book I was reading so as soon as I finished that last night, I started reading.  Everything picked up right where Bared to You left off, which made me incredibly happy.  There were no missing chunks to the story and it was like I was just continuing to read the previous book.  There was more drama this time and more hot sex.  The drama outweighed the sex this time around, which made me happy too.<br /><br />I am still head over heels for Gideon and Eva.  I am still annoyed by Cary's antics and I still think Eva's mother is an uptight, overbearing socialite who needs to get a grip and realize she doesn't love Stanton, just his money.  This time around, we learn more about Gideon's past. We also learn that Eva's ex-stepbrother was in the city, stalking her and blackmailing Gideon and Stanton.  Eva only learns about him being in the city when he turns up dead.<br /><br />I am seriously excited to finish reading the trilogy.  I can't wait for the final book to be released.  Hopefully the breakthroughs from this book carry over and we get less drama and more of the romance between Gideon and Eva.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is fun to play.  Not too easy or hard.  This is one of my favorites.  I highly recommend it.

0345525558|4.0|\\"The Language of Flowers\\" is a book of contrasts. The protagonist, Victoria Jones, is a waif who was abandoned by her parents. I like the fact that the author, Vanessa Diffenbaugh, thought of such a name. Will she be victorious? And Jones is a common name.  Victoria is hardened by life at its earliest age while most people are hardened by the calamities of life as they age. She learns that flowers are the friends that she can rely on and that flowers offer a beautiful softer side to her life. She studies the meanings of flowers which have a language of their own. (Victoria's dictionary in back of book.) Will she overcome this hard shell she lives in? At the end of the novel, the author Diffenbaugh wraps up her first novel with a bouquet of emotions tied with a ribbon and hopefully Victoria is victorious over her future.

Slowly, the pieces of the puzzle fall into place.<br /><br />The reader has front row seats to police investigations and a behind the scenes view of the actual truth to any trial. We are allowed into the forensic psychiatrist's office as she interviews Jacob (for the defense) and we learn, as the family in the story learns, all about \\"the killing gene.\\"  The killing gene is a mutation of a gene that is passed down from generation to generation and can cause personality disorders such as Narcissistic Personality Disorder as well as Personality Attachment Disorder. The science, combined with the law, is intermingled to tell the story of a family fighting to defend Jacob in today's world of 'trial by media,' where the truth rarely matters. It's the 'win' that matters most.<br /><br />This story had so many twists and turns that I didn't know until the last few pages what the outcome would be, and it is brilliantly written. I found the forensic science helped me understand the psychology of each character, and the author nailed it. Each character came to life and jumped off the page.<br /><br />Pages 96 and 97 contain some of the most chilling words I have ever read:<br /><br />\\"...You are naive. You imagine the courts are reliable, that wrong results are rare, and therefore I ought to have trusted the system. If he truly believed Jacob was innocent, you are thinking, he would have simply let the police sweep in and take whatever they liked.  Here is the dirty little secret: the error rate in criminal verdicts is much higher than anyone imagines.  Not just false negatives, the guilty criminals who get off scot-free \\"errors\\" we recognize and accept.  They are the predictable result of stacking the deck in the defendants' favor as we do.  The real surprise is the frequency of false positives, the innocent men found guilty.  That error rate we do not acknowledge-do not even think about-because it calls so much into question.  The fact is, what we call proof is as fallible as the witnesses who produce it, human beings all...\\"<br /><br />Defending Jacob-a page turner that will not disappoint.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Another completely fabulous book in this series I am totally addicted - It's jacked!!!<br /><br />I have developed emotional attachments to the characters, thank you George R R Martin
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it! I like being able to find all sorts of unique things on here. It is fun and there are some very creative people on Pinterest. Love it!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|My husband and I read this together and both loved it. We have already read the second book and are working on the third. One thing I really appreaciated was the research the author must have done to make the Irish pantheon and the Druid sound legitimate. The author also pays homage to some great nerd icons. Once you pick it up you won't stop until your done. Enjoy!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|What an awesome movie!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie, it's great for all ages. There is some violence so be aware of that if young children are watching but it's nothing to bad.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill were made for each other in this film. You could actually believe they truly were brothers, they knew each other so well. This movie was absolutely hilarious! There were so many twists and turns on their journey to becoming \\"real cops\\", I had to watch it twice. If you want to laugh until you cry,(and laugh and cry some more!!) this movie is absolutely for you! Five thumbs up!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator app that is simple and easy to use! I've had no issues with it so far! The numbers are easy to read which is another plus.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great fun. like the fact you can leave game when boss walks in and pick right up when I leave
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This series lacked a lot of things!  Where do I start??? The plot was ridiculous, writing was repetitive, and reading the first book should suffice your curiosity for what all the hoopla is about regarding this series. I was a fan of the twilight series and this series Doesn't hold a candle to it. PLEASE do yourself a favor and do not waste another minute on this series. If you want to read a great adult version of twilight read the black dagger brotherhood series.
B009JBZH54|2.0|Just saw that Amazon.com uploaded the back of this set...<br /><br />Read it carefully... it basically looks like the first disc of all the Blu-Ray movies with a sample of the actual book that has been available for some time...<br /><br />I realize that there is an \\"Ultimate\\" version coming in 2013... but WB has a nack for really screwing the pooch when it comes to \\"Ultimate sets\\". Look up the [[ASIN:B007FSEAHY Harry Potter Wizard's Collection]] which was also released a few months after the initial Blu-Ray set. Then tell me you still want to wait for a \\"better\\" set.<br /><br />I would rather have seen the Bat Cowl include the trilogy, but at this rate what could they possibly do to make it the trilogy \\"Ultimate\\"? Nolan is notorious for not giving any deleted scenes or bonus content... so what exactly would you expect to find other than a prettier box than this lazily put together grab bag of previous (and soon to be released) editions of the individual movies?<br /><br />Seriously considering just getting the Bat Cowl edition and purchasing the other two movies separately...
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I purchased the Lego set for my grand daughter for Xmas because she loves building with them. I shop a lot through Amazon because the prices are very reasonable compared to other stores such as Walmart.<br />However, in this instance the Shipping and Handling cost way more than the actual product so I sent in a complaint.  The owner of the store was very generous and gave me a full refund which I greatly appreciate.<br />If you don't care about the shipping and handling cost, the Lego set is very good for children to build on their creative thought processing skills, and just fun to play with.
B005KELQEU|4.0|I like this case a lot because I like to hold my kindle while reading without the weight of a cover.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I found the Piano Guys on YouTube about 6 months ago.  They take popular songs and put a classical twist on them with a piano and cello, it is truly beautiful music.  Half of what blows me away is the production values of their videos.  You HAVE to watch them on YouTube.  I regularly get chills.  And the best part is that my whole family loves them! We have dance parties, and my seven year old is more excited for a new video release than we are!  Some days at work I just log on to their YouTube channel and just set it to play while I'm working.  They day flies by.  LOVE THE PIANO GUYS!  KEEP IT UP!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game and have been playing it for over a year on facebook. I was thrilled when I found it as an app for android- so I downloaded it on my kindle fire!
B002ZG999U|5.0|Thank you so much.  great find for a great price. Would highly recommend to all my friends and family.  Funny movie worth the time to buy and watch.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is one of the must watch series' if you are into the war hero type shows. This set was on sale for $25 so it was a no brainer for me to pick up! High quality case, something you would be proud of to have in your collection.
B0053O89WY|5.0|What is there to say?  If your already a fan of the show the DVD's / Blue-Rays are a must have
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|500 Days of Summer is a great chick flick to watch with your girlfriend. It may not be for all guys, but sometimes you just want to just spend time with your girlfriend and watch something that she would be interested in besides your typical action movie. I remember watching it for the first time at The Grove in LA on a perfect Summer night with that special someone, which is why I bought this blu-ray. The picture quality is perfect as well as the sound. Joseph Gordon-Levitt can thank this movie for upstarting his career!
B005L38QHA|4.0|While i do not use the steelseries software for more than setting the dps and colors, I found this to be the best mouse for playing<br />WoW i have ever owned. even better than my Naga,
B0001VV1GK|5.0|my 3 year old loves cars. We got this for his birthday and he plays with it every day. It keeps his focus and he can use all kinds of cars on it. We like it because he can use his imagination and since it's wood it is so much more durable than the plastic competitors.
0316228532|5.0|The casual vacancy is not usually my type of book, and it got me time to get into it (around 20% in, I think), but once I did, I was really glad I stick with it. How she handle the characters is very interesting and the ending kind of shock me actually. It was really nice and I'd recommend it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I honestly don't know what to say other than I love this movie!  It has probably some of the best one liners I've heard in a long time.  All of these characters and actors work so well together.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|After seeing her in concert this past July , I was anxiously waiting for her newest album.  I had heard some preview tracks a while back and knew it was going to be more of 20's style jazz. I bought it because I have the rest of her collection, but unless it grows on me, I can't imagine it will get the amount of play that her more traditional jazz or bossa albums get. From This Moment On, to me was the last really great album she has done. I hope in two or three years when she releases her next, she will go back to what most of us love about her music.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game has great graphics and is easy to play jusr like the arcade game.  You earn coins daily so you dont have to buy them.
0316228532|4.0|As I write this, the bad reviews for The Casual Vacancy outnumber the good reviews.  That's too bad, because this is a well written book, one that is certainly worth reading.<br /><br />If The Casual Vacancy was from an unknown author, I think it would receive high praise from critics and the general public.  The problem is, it has J.K. Rowling's name on it.<br /><br />I believe that many people bought The Casual Vacancy with a pre-conceived notion of what it was and what they wanted it to be, then were disappointed when it was not at all what they had expected (or hoped for, or thought it ought to have been).<br /><br /> This is not Harry Potter.  This is not a book that will leave you feeling uplifted and full of wonder.  This is a dark, gloomy story that pits the haves against the have-nots.  It has a deeply emotional storyline that takes you to a place that's akin a raw, open sore.  Rape, drug use, poverty, mental illness, and death are central themes.  People in the book say bad words; they do bad things; they'll make you cringe and shake your head is disbelief of what they've done (and what is done to them).  The text, and the character development, can be very depressing (though it's expertly interspersed with Rowling's sharp, biting humor.)  I found it put me into a bad mood during the three days I was reading it; this is a book that you wouldn't want to take to the beach on vacation.  I really can't imagine how Ms. Rowling dealt with revisiting these characters, day after day, during the time she was writing this book.<br /><br />There really is no one single plot, but a series of many little stories that gradually evolve into one; it is, at its core, a character study.  What appears to be the driving focus of the book, at least at the start, is the drive to find a replacement for the late Barry Fairbrother's seat on the Parrish council - the \\"casual vacancy\\" of the title.  This eventually plays out, but it's really not that big a moment in the whole schemeof things.<br /><br /> Admittedly, the first half of the book - especially the first 100 pages - was slow-moving; Rowling takes her time to develop each and every character, and there are an awful lot of them (so many, in fact, that I had a difficult time keeping them separate at first).  But the second half really picked up, and the ending (some reviewers said they saw it coming - I didn't) was shocking and brutal.<br /><br />Why should you read The Casual Vacancy, then, if it's so depressingly dark?  Because Rowling has created a fascinating world, one that features expertly-crafted fictional characters inserted into all-too-real situations.  There are no simple spells to make their problems go away; this is real life, raw and emotional.  If you're looking for a Potter-esque fantasy, look somewhere else (have you read Ready Player One?  It's a great read).  However, it you're looking for an intriguing, gritty look at class warfare and the problems of modern society, by all means buy a copy.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|idiots why the heck is there an error with this freaking game when I download this genie game fix this please
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Great music and nice booklet to look thorugh.<br />A lot of songs; great for studying music.<br />I would recommend this for purchase.
B0086700CM|5.0|YOU SHOULD GET THIS.  I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO BE ON THE KINDEL FIRE so get it!!! xD
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the book.  I know that it is all fiction, but man what a guy!!!!! and she knows how to keep him too.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Takes you through all the extremes of emotion. Its refreshing, raw, sad and lovely but best of all it truly ignites your \\"inner goddess\\".
B008673ZAQ|5.0|i was a fan of 50 shades but was left hanging terribly when that series ended. This series blows 50 out of the water (sorry christen i still love you) i finished both books in a day or two, once you start reading your hooked. It was definitly a emotional roller coaster, but when she loved gideon, i loved him, when she was jealous and hated him, i hated him. The ending was epic as well! I can't wait to see more of Gideon and Eva's life entwine together!
B001NLKT60|4.0|Great read!! Love the trilogy! The first book was awesome, 2nd book was great too, and now Im in the third book, which is wrapping it all up and a must read.
B00571F26Y|2.0|Think this is a book that the gluten intolerant would benefit from, anyway I got bored and quit reading it, as I don't think it applies to everyone.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! I play it everyday and never get bored with it. the activities are fun and challenging but not impossible to beat. I also love that I can get notifications about the game right on my kindle :-)
0316228532|1.0|Wow, I can't believe I actually finished this book. I kind of feel like I need to go boil my brain. There's a lot of language and whatever else you can imagine that's adult in this one - but actually the bigger problem for me was the unrelenting, soul-sucking cynicism and negativity. I kept reading because I was waiting for something to shift, for her to show some little glimpse of redemption or hope for ANY of the characters... something to give meaning. It never really happened until the very very end, and by then, it was just waaaay too late.<br /><br />I wonder what happened to Ms. Rowling to make her hate humanity so much between HP and this? I actually wish I had never read it, let alone bought it. I might recycle this rather than putting it into the donation bin lest some innocent youngster happen upon it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm normally not a fan of this genre, but this book was wildly entertaining.  Bravo!  The character development and pacing were wonderful and I thought the multi-perspective back-and-forth was brilliant.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I initially read Wool 1 and was wanting more. So I bought the Omnibus editon and was mesmerized. As a reader, I highly recommend this. As a knitter, I enjoyed following the thread from Book 1 through 5. I'm planning to read Book 6. Well written, Mr. Howey.
0451530462|4.0|The book was in fine condition and arrived in a timely manner. I feel perfectly alright about this book. It's certainly an interesting premise with a nice-enough plot, but it's certainly not something I would've read if the book had not been assigned for class.<br /><br />Good purchase for my Brit Lit class!
B0083H6AQA|4.0|This movie is so much better than the critics say.  It is a period piece and therefore a hard sell to most.  The cast is brilliant and the costumes are amazing.<br />Totally worth the price.
B00112ASXU|5.0|We looked for a time to find this male lion, there seems to be a shortage of them out in the stores.  What a nice male lion, too!
B00705GEO4|5.0|Recommended if you enjoy traditional heavy metal such as Iron Maiden, Firewind, Judas Priest, etc... The production is flawless. The lyrics are mature and deal with history. the musicianship is second to none. A new epic for the ages. Instant classic!
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far, so good. I like the graphics and the story line. lets hope it stays this good! the rooms are fun to explore and there are so many possible ways to keep the game moving. that's an important thing to me.
B0015UKX7E|5.0|This is not a concert, this is a Party. If you like Prince just a little this dvd may change your mind. Don't walk, run out and get this dvd now while you can. And party like its 1999. A must have.
1451696205|2.0|My 14yo daughter, an avid reader of at least 4 books per month, was underwhelmed with this book.  She loves to read books before seeing the movies based on them and this is the first time she has expressed this measure of disinterest.  She read the book in less than 2 afternoons/evenings, waiting for the story to strenthen... It never happened.  Now she says she doesn't even care to see the movie.  Wow...
B007GCY8FS|1.0|The premise of this novel started well:  Reacher in a car with people whose story doesn't add up and Reacher wants to find out why.  Then Reacher is out of the car and into his investigation and the plot begins to unravel. Characters are revealed to have different roles and sides without foreshadowing.  Motivations are never explained and in the end a bloodbath ensues for that cliched reason of revenge for comrade fallen.  Yawn...  I've read all the Reacher books.  Some are better than others, but this is is the worst so far.  Glad I borrowed it from a friend!
B000RUAR5G|5.0|This movie is probably one of the best things that young me ever did see. One of the defining movies of my generation.
B008N1V11U|3.0|Awesome game but it has a glitch that removes the controls and Batman just stands there. I happens always at the same spot. Please fix this.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is back in true form. Lee Child takes the reader on another \\"how can this possibly turn out?\\" journey with his new book, Wanted Man. One wonders how Child's imagination can be so creative...or does this actually happen? If you're already a Reacher fan, you won't be disappointed when you pick up this book. If you're not yet a fan, you'll be hooked after this read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good old solitaire,  like comfort food, reliable,  familiar, in a handy format that is a snap to use, and it's. free!
B000N6UERK|3.0|this is basically a good popcorn film; a blend of thriller, action, and the paranormal genres. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Tony Scott, it boasts a first rate cast (Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, Jim Caviezel, and Val Kilmer) and backs them with solid production values. It was the first film shot in New Orleans after Katrina. The story centers on a terrorist bombing of a ferry carrying navy sailors with their families during shore leave.  Washington stars as an ATF agent who is pulled into a federal task force using proprietary technology to reconstruct the crime scene in ways never thought possible. Interestingly, the technology is not totally dissimilar to the machine later created in the television series \\"Person of Interest.\\" Just about the time you permit yourself to buy into the believability of that technology, the plot takes things to a whole new level of incredulity involving time travel. Without providing too much in the way of plot spoilers, the ending is satisfyingly happy. The plot clearly requires the viewer to set aside issues such as credibility. However, it does move a long at a sufficiently fast pace, and I found the acting, production, and suspense sufficiently interesting to permit me to enjoy the film for what it is-- a fun two hours.<br /><br />As far as the Blu-Ray disc is concerned, it looked and sounded good in a high end home theater. I never saw it on DVD and cannot comment on any technical comparisons between the two formats.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So much better than the movie, an excellent book, couldn't put it down! Not just for the young. I am on the third book, what an amazing trilogy.
B008I15774|5.0|I have these recordings from other EMI releases.  They are among my favorite Beethoven and Bruckner.  They may not be the only versions you will own but they will be ones you will not part with.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I never bought any movies for the fact that most movies do not have replay value.  This movie is different.  The Avengers always my favorite superheroes and I give kudos to Marvel for building the Avengers up starting with the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor.<br /><br />The plot is very easy to follow and the actions are quite amazing.  A lot of positive things have already been said, so I'm not going to rehash everything.  The best part of the movie is it is quite funny as well.  We love the part where Hulk took Loki and whack him like a rag doll.<br /><br />Now on to the product and Amazon service.  The set comes in 4 CDs and for the price, you can't find that anywhere.  I preordered for $30.  With the price guarantee, Amazon refund $10 back to me.  Nice!  So the final price is $20.<br /><br />We used the DVD, and Blue-Ray.  We never had the chance to test BR-3D because we do not have 3D tv.  The digital copy is something else.  Yes it does comes with 2 versions, Windows Media and Apple format.  My laptop was able to play the Windows format without any problem.  However, when I entered the code in my iTune, nothing seems to work.  So after several tries, I gave up.<br /><br />The Windows file will only play with proper CODEC and security settings, due to copyright issue.  It is not transferable to any media player as the box claimed.  I tried to covert the file to another format, but no luck.  I even tried to rip the DVD for my own use (no, I don't torrent files).  That didn't work either.  So, long story short, the digital copy is not portable as the manufacturer claim.  Having it is just as useless as being tied to a DVD player.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a book club selection and I thoroughly enjoyed the read!  I was even able to stay up past ten o'clock to finish it!  Ha! Ha!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is easy to use on the Kindle Fire.  I just love it.  It is more User friendly than the computer I think.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I loved this game on my Mother's iPad and couldn't wait for it to come to the Kindle. When it did I downloaded it and began playing it. As I played it realized that it didn't have goals for you to earn things. Automatically I thought it downloaded wrong. So I re-downloaded it. Now I have the goals. I don't know why I had to re-download it, but I hope to have no more problems.
B0087HT36U|4.0|had to rate it to continue, but I do like the game. :) It is totally an AB knockoff but I got it as faotd so no complaints.
B00000JFV9|5.0|Car Wash, Shaft and this. That's all you need. There's more great funk out there (James Brown (of course), Funkadelic/Parliament, the Meters, the Temptations, early Kool and the Gang), but as far as soundtracks go these 3 are the bomb. Oh, I suppose I really should add the Saturday Night Fever OST to the list. So, the holy foresome, then.
B004NDVJA0|5.0|This is a great CD.  I can't wait to hear what else she puts out. It's wonderful and gets better each time I hear it.
0525952926|3.0|This was very similarly written to Fall of Giants.  Nice historical facts (I learned a few things too!) but generally too many characters, and none of them develop deeply enough to give a crap about.  A bit tedious and boring actually.  You may want to read it immediately following FOG since I forgot who everyone was by the time this came around and had to try to rememeber.  I love Pillars of the Earth...nothing since has compard.
B008J34466|5.0|I have not stopped listening to this since I bought it.  It's addictive and so good.  I listen over and over again
0525953728|5.0|This book was written be the very best of the best our country produces........It's a story of what the guts of our country always was, and still is, away from the garbage that has become our elected officials, who are nothing short of a disgrace and an embarrament to us and on the world stage.........Owen had the guts to tell the truth that he and his team earned, as opposed to the politicos that are fat, out of touch, and don't deserve the trust of the American people..........This is the real deal and a major breath of fresh air...............God Blees these guys, and The United States of Americas very best..........
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I feel that this is little more than a traditional Mills and Boon romance that was mixed with some information regarding alternative sexual issues, if there is such a thing.  The writing skill dissapoints and the story has little content. Too much reading needed for a small story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fast and easy to use! I prefer using this app over logging onto my computer. I love that I can take Pinterest anywhere I go.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is like the best game I ever played. so the people who says it ducks well they are so wrong. this game is so fun that I would play it all day long if I could. so don't believe those people who say it is worth nothing it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001V5CIFI|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but it is certainly not another Mary Poppins movie.  I previewed it before allowing my grandchildren, ages 6 to 12, to watch it.  After about halfway, I decided it was not suitable for children because the woman was showing too, too much cleavage for children to see.  I don't even like looking at it, myself.  The second Nanny McPhee was okay but don't let your children watch the first.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|I'm so happy, with this novel IB has returned to max-strength Sci-Fi, delivering a vintage that I've thirsted for desperately.<br /><br />Since Consider Phlebas I've been a Fan. No, actually, since Wasp Factory I've been a Fan (but that's cheating ;). But, it was the Player of Games that convinced me that I'd buy every SF novel IB would generate. I've done that, though the journey has been a tough one over the last few novels.<br /><br />Like many I'm a fan of culture and several of the last books, while being of the  of Culture Universe & holding to the Meme's of his own writing style, they each left me feeling that we were collectively heading into a a kind of Escher-like state of ever-decreasing Galaxy views down to 'only' personalities.<br /><br />This is important; what Banks has always achieved with his SF is the ability to seamlessly weave great & good Galactic Opera with the tiniest of human stories \\"for the want of the nail, the shoe was lost\\" Banks has always been at his best when he succeeds at illustrating that the nails (Cossont, QiRia) could affect the lives of an entire Civilisation (Gzilt) ... or not.<br /><br />I don't do detail of the story in reviews, many others do that. I like to tell you how it felt to go through the journey. This novel resonated with Banks best works (for me). It left me smiling & satisfied (well, and thoughtful & ruminant). Like the very best of vintage wines the complexity of this novel will leave you with a sense of profound satisfaction.<br /><br />A Banks fan - you will be happy. New to Banks - welcome, you are abut to experience what the very best of SF can offer
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love it,get ready to spend some time.  You won't want to stop playing. The best is the pig in a two wheeled cart that blows bubbles with carrots and rocks, the music is really fun. Enjoy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Review by totallybookedblog.com<br /><br />Gitte:  I am in absolute awe of Sylvia Day. The journey of Gideon and Eva got even more sensual, obsessive, raw and emotional in Reflected in You. It was exhausting, gripping and my heart hurt more than I can say as I devoured it in one sitting.<br /><br />Jenny:  I had seen the snippets of this book on Sylvia's page and couldn't wait to get my hands on it and it didn't disappoint.  I couldn't put this book down. I was drawn in from the very beginning.<br />This book is intense, emotional, at times frustrating (yes...I'm talking about you Gideon...you tested me at times!), passionate, sensual and at times sad.  It had everything for me.<br /><br />Quote:  \\"I'm obsessed with you, angel. Addicted to you. You're everything I've ever wanted or needed, everything I've ever dreamed of. You're everything. I live and breathe you. For you.\\" - Gideon<br /><br />Gitte:  I felt like a voyeur,  one minute sighing with relief that this emotionally damaged couple had found in each other a way to heal and know they are worthy of love and love in return without conditions and the next frustrated at the game playing and the circles they run around each other. Their journey is both painful and emotional yet erotic and addictive.<br /><br />Jenny:  There's no getting around it.  Eva and Gideon are scarred and damaged.  Their pasts haunt them and we are taken on the rollercoaster that is their relationship and we get the whole gamut of emotions with this one.  These two use sex as a way of dealing with their feelings instead of talking, but soon realise sex isn't enough to sustain the relationship they want to nurture.  There are times you want to shake them both, especially Gideon.  They are extremely passionate in their emotions and their sexual encounters are so hot and sensual you will need to fan yourself.  These two absolutely set the pages on fire.<br /><br />Quote: \\"You know what happens when you run angel. I catch you.\\" - Gideon<br /><br />Gitte:  If at all possible I fell even more in love with Gideon and Eva. We re-join them in their continued fight to exist together in their relationship. So dependent on each other it is an obsession and addiction. Gideon and Eva cannot function without each other. They need each other.<br /><br />Both are tortured survivors of sexual abuse which has left them with open wounds so deep that translated into behaviour, their love for each other becomes this obsessive and almost violent entity.<br /><br />Jenny:  Gideon and Eva have \\"survived\\" - violent, abusive pasts.  Up until they meet they have simply gone through the motions of dealing and have used sex as a coping mechanism in their lives. These two need each other like they need air to breathe.  They can't function a day without each other.  Both are sensual, sexual, passionate and emotional people.  I love Eva.  She is one of my favourite book heroines.  I love that even though she is damaged and openly admits her faults and even thought her desperate need for Gideon borders on obsession she still remains a strong character and is such a good equal to Gideon.<br />Gideon......just when I thought I couldn't love him more I do! This man is one of the sexiest, alpha characters I have read.  He worships and adores Eva and loves her without exception.<br />The scene when he is brushing her hair............just wait...that did me in!<br /><br />Quote:  \\"My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We'd never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession.\\"<br /><br />Gitte:  They know this and acknowledge it by seeking couple therapy in order to understand just what a healthy and normal relationship really is and learn how to trust one another.  What Gideon and Eva don't lackis sexual compatibility. Their sexual chemistry is off the charts; intense, powerful and will literally set you on fire.<br /><br />Jenny:  You are spot one GG.  These two have sexual chemistry that just burns the pages.  Every sexual encounter with these two is off the charts.<br /><br />Quote::  \\"You hit me the instant I saw you. I couldn't look away. I wanted you immediately. Excessively. Almost violently.\\" - Gideon<br /><br />Quote:  \\"A delicious shiver moved through me. When it came to Gideon, I was more than willing to be devoured.\\" - Eva<br /><br />Gitte:  YEAH DON'T WE ALL!!! Especially when we picture Gideon as the gorgeous David Gandy!<br /><br />Jenny:  As if Gideon isn't hot enough...add David Gandy into the mix and whoa!!!<br /><br />Quote:  \\"His kisses were gifts. He kissed with everything he had, with power and passion and hunger and love. He held nothing back, giving everything, exposing everything.\\" - Eva<br /><br />Quote:  \\"You're the greatest risk I've ever taken. And the greatest reward.\\" - Gideon<br /><br />Gitte:  Gideon is such an enigma.  But what an amazing, gorgeous and sensual dominating enigma. I LOVE him. Truly, madly, deeply!<br />This man shares nothing about his past or even his present.  He does, however, show Eva how powerful his love for her is.<br /><br />Jenny:  I loved Gideon in Bared to You but in this book....apart from the times he was so secretive I wanted to slap him - oh who am I kidding, even then  I loved him.  This man is intense, domineering and so alpha, yet he shows his love for Eva in so many ways.  There is nothing he wouldn't do for her - she has become his reason for living.  His reason for breathing.  He cannot function without her.<br /><br />Gitte: Besides the sexual intensity, he also shows it through control and demand, protection and comfort.  My heart broke for him, the thought of this little boy who suffered; who grew up and is still suffering through horrific nightmares.  Nightmares through which he is petrified he will eventually harm Eva.<br />Ultimately secrets will out but until they do insecurities and doubts will flourish. You put your heart out there it may eventually be hurt by both truths and lies.<br /><br />Jenny:  My heart broke for him too GG, especially with how he would deal with his nightmares.  He was hurting and so was Eva but they had to do what was necessary for them both to get through their turmoil. I did feel that both characters grew such much at the end of this book.<br /><br />Quote: \\"Are you hurt anywhere else?\\" I asked, feeling so emotionally raw after the long night we'd had. He caught my wrist and pulled my hand down to press flat over his heart. \\"Here.\\"<br /><br />Gitte:  The anticipation of not knowing was frustrating and heart breaking but once you know the why's and things come to light, you understand and WANT Gideon just as he is and you will realize that the love he has for Eva has no limits. Even Eva who is a strong heroine already, shows some real back bone in this story and the pair of them as dysfunctional, possessive and jealous as they are also show extreme vulnerability and tenderness.<br />The ending will leave you stunned. It will literally blow your mind...it's going to be a long 3 months until we get Entwined with You!!<br /><br />Jenny:  I must admit there was a time in this story when I got so frustrated with Gideon.  I can't say much because I don't want to give anything away but boy did he test me.  Eva really came through in this book.  What a great character she is.  I adore her! Her love for Gideon is beyond question and in return he has a love so strong for Eva there is nothing he wouldn't do for her.  These two will take you one hell of a ride that's for sure! There will be times when you'll wonder just what the hell is going with these two -  I found myself actually wanting to skip pages to see what was going to happen because I became so anxious!  Just you wait!  This story is so well crafted when the ending comes it will leave you breathless and chomping at the bit for Entwined with You! I know I can't wait and I also know what I'm doing on December 31st!petrified he will eventually harm Eva.<br />Ultimately secrets will out but until they do insecurities and doubts will flourish.

B003QTWR08|5.0|Great movie! An oldie but goodie. Well done. Worth the rental. Would recommend for kids and adults. A touching story with an excellent message.
1609611543|5.0|I am just starting the wheat free diet and already see results.  I have also benefited from the information on the relation between stress and belly fat that I found in this little book. [[ASIN:B008473292 Stress, Belly Fat and Adrenal Fatigue]]
B008MU8ZOI|2.0|Although I would rate Jeepers Creepers as an excellent horror flick, I was very disappointed in its video quality on Blu-ray.  There are a few scenes where the blu treatment shines; but alas, they are few and far between.  Audio is very good, however.  If you have the DVD version and a decent up-converting player, I suggest you skip this one unless you can find it at a basement bargain price.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is one of my favorite apps / sites, and I'm thrilled to see this on the Kindle Fire. It works great most of the time &amp; is FREE which is music to my ears :)
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Ben Howard has a beautiful voice and the lyrics speak vollumes to me. I reccomend this cd highly. Can't wait for more from him.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|Have n the ability to preview the songs on the cd made me want it more. the drive n beats and lyrics on \\"Do you know the meaning of the Blues\\" brings it home 2 me
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Beautiful Disaster was a great love story. Abby the main charter was a bit frustrating at times, but it made her more real.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|An AWESOME debut album from CRB! A bit of the Dead, old Black Crowes, and southern rock tossed in for good measure! Love it! Chris's vocals are great as ever, Neil's guitar is superb, and Adam's keyboard wizardry is mesmerizing! Still debating on whether I like this album or 'The Magic Door' better...Ahh, just BUY both of them and put your player onto shuffle, since both albums were recorded at the same time and dovetail one another very well! Glad and Freaky Tidings : )
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love this app! Has made pinning on my kindle fire much easier.  Only suggestions are a pin it button and a way to pin something to more than one board.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|An AWESOME sophomore album from CRB WITH a FABULOUS cover and inside sleeve artwork by Alan Forbes! I may buy the ALBUM version, just for the ARTWORK, since I do not own a turntable any longer... The sound reminds me a bit of the Dead, old Black Crowes(Three Snakes, Amorica, Tall era),Pink Floyd with the keyboard sounds, and southern rock tossed in for good measure! The highlight is 'Vibration & Light Suite', at over 13 minutes! Who does that anymore? I love that they did it! That song alone is enough to buy this album. But ALL the songs shine in their own special way! Chris's vocals are great as ever, Neil's guitar is superb, and Adam's keyboard wizardry is mesmerizing! Still debating on whether I like this album or 'Big Moon Ritual' better...Ahh, just BUY Both 'Big Moon Ritual' AND 'The Magic Door', your ears and head will be happy : ) Since both albums were recorded at the same time, they dovetail one another very well. So, just pop your player into shuffle mode, pop in BOTH discs, sit back, and ENJOY!! Lava lamp optional : ) Glad and Freaky Tidings : )
B008LY9AWG|4.0|As in all Michael Connelly's book, this is very good. There is the suspense and different twist. These are 3 short stories that are quick to read and enjoyable
B0018BF1KY|5.0|This 5 cd set is a must for the new or casual Rory Gallagher fan. Rory Gallagher devotees will also appreciate the extra tracks on each album and the inclusion of Deuce, which is out of print. Awesomeness from a HIGHLY underrated musician!The price is unbeatable for such a superb artist. A MUST HAVE set! BUY IT!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is super fun i love this game it is great for passing time and for if you are bord. it is fun for all ages and it is AWSOME!
B000003TA4|5.0|A superb album, just as it was 21 years ago! Definitely get the original version, as opposed to the 20th anniversary \\"remastered\\" edition, even if it is used. The remastered edition has lost the pop and subtle nuances of the original edition. So, get the original while you can!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was really surprised after reading the first chapter. Once I started reading I had a hard time putting it down. The writer did a very good job of keeping you interested. There were obvious surprises on every other pages. It is hard to imagine there are people in this world that would be involved as Mr. Grey was in the book. I actually did enjoy reading this book.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|From his early brilliance in \\"Beetlejuice\\" and \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" to now 'Dark Shadows\\", Tim Burton has made many well-received and money making films including \\"Batman\\", \\"Planet of the Apes, \\"Big Fish\\", \\"Charlie and Chocolate Factory\\", \\"Corpse Bride\\" and \\"Alice In Wonderland\\".  With the exceptions of \\"Corpse Bride\\" and \\"Sweeney Todd\\", I didn't find Tim Burton had truly made a \\"Tim Burton\\" film since his \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" in 1990.<br /><br />This latest \\"Dark Shadows\\" based on a popular day-time TV series from the 70's is another half-cooked mess.  It is the result of those so-called \\"auteur\\" film directors being given a free-hand to proceed filming of a not-yet-ready script hoping for a miracle.  This film is crowded with name actors, high production values but with cardboard/under-developed characters with a story line that limps along and goes nowhere.  It is neither scary nor funny nor both.  Adding salt to the wound, picking Johnny Depp as the main character of the film.  He resembles more of a penguin than a blood sucking vampire.  And he continues using his quirkiness for his acting.  Next comes Tonto!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The stories are the perfect mix of humor and action, drama and unfulfilled romance (maybe this season not so unfulfilled).  Everyone can enjoy this series and the writers are amazing.
0316228532|1.0|This book is tragic - not in the literary sense.  Every last cliched character was despicable.  I actually began to dread reading further because I was bored by the unrelenting sordidness.  Halfway through I had the thought that perhaps she had meant this to be a black comedy.  But there wasn't a modicum of humor to be found in the relentless depictions of abuse, hatred, suffering, betrayal, physical ailments, and crummy weather. A waste of 17 bucks on my part, and talent on hers.
0525953728|5.0|This was an excellent book, practically impossible to not read in one sitting. I felt like I was on a very exciting mission. I watched the 2nd plane hit the wtc on live tv sept 11, 2001 & felt a great sense of relief when, FINALLY Bin Laden got what was coming to him. Thank you so much to Mark, and every seal, pilot, intel op, or jsoc employee who made it happen. God bless America! Buy this book, it puts a nice book end to Bin Ladens pitiful existence.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This is by far one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.  Puss totally dominates the big screen.  I hope there is a sequel!
B009IF7JRA|4.0|we still have the show in high school AND new york city. although i am enjoying the musical numbers in the high school, i am enjoying far more the adult story in new york. i am especially enjoying the story with kurt where he has gone into the fashion industry with sarah jessica parker instead of ahow biz like rachel. he means for this to be a temporary detour but he is very well suited for being in the fashion industry. at this point if they wanted to spin off a new show with kurt in the fashion industry, i would be following right along with the new show. having half a new cast in the high school version is jarring, they are still not melding very well. also, making sue sylvester into a nicer person may be a mistake.  i for one miss those funny segments where she was editorializing on tv with her utterly outrageous views. in short, this show needs to recover its equilibrium but it still does great musical performances,
B009EAO38C|5.0|The Piano Guys know how to make some seriously good music.  Check out their YouTube videos!  I like that their music is fun for me and my young kids.  Even my 3-year-old loves it.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Such life changing imformation. The word \\"love\\" has opened my eyes to so many avenues that I never thought before reading THE POWER. I love this  book.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|It was such a funny movie, of course any movie staring Jennifer Lopzes is super. I have not had a baby for 50 years, but once a mom always a mom.  It's a \\"girl movie\\" if you are a girl you will like this story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works well. I like how it lets me know when my charger is hooked up. Pleasant colors good overall interface.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was so funny yet sad in a way. Retired U.S. men and women unable to afford to live in our great USA so searching for an affordable home in India? They found the hotel in India and the adventure begins a new life for them all. If you are over 60 you should like this movie.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I always enjoy anything Nichols Sparks writes but it was not my favorite, but it was good.  I would recommend it.
1582701709|5.0|This book is incredibly powerful.  My dad was a huge proponent of it and was always trying to get me to read it.  He was very old school and a little dramatic.  He would always say how it changed his life and how the book really was the secret to life.  I was always skeptical because his claims were pretty far fetched.  All my skepticism vanished when I finally took the time to read it.<br /><br />What a powerful piece of work.  It truly touches on points and subjects that seem redundant and pointless and brings out amazing qualities.  This is a must read book, truly.  For anyone who is soul searching or who just wants more insight into their spiritual self, read this book.  It is incredible.  There really isn't a clear cut secret, but it does open doors that I didn't know existed.  I felt like a better person after reading this book.  It really matured and grounded me.  The Secret should be on every thoughtful person's bookshelf at home
B002M5E2DW|5.0|The lessons in The Secret were critical to my personal transformation. In fact, I would never have written [[ASIN:061554052X The Pi of Life]] if I hadn't discovered that my thoughts create my reality. I certainly wouldn't actively help others.<br />I probably wouldn't be here at all...<br />I spent most of my life playing the victim, feeling like everything was out of my control. But the philosophies and concepts in \\"The Secret\\" helped me understand that if I truly wanted to change my life I had to change my thoughts and focus on what I wanted.<br />\\"The Secret\\" wasn't the first book I read that helped me understand the connection between my thoughts and my life, but it was early on my path of healing. It opened vital windows of truth and created bridges of understanding that might have taken years to develop on their own.<br />The only thing I found lacking in \\"The Secret\\" was a call to action. It's not enough to just think about what you want; you must do something about it!<br />\\"The Secret\\" is a fantastic book and well worth your time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Hard to put down once you start. Notice the number of reviews. That's what caught my attention.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So many words come to mind. WOW! OMG! EXCELLENT! FREAKING CLEVER! Knew something was up, but....HOLY SHITZAH, Batman! Didn't see that one coming. Have to thank all the many friends, readers, reviewers and sites I visit that didn't spoil this for me.  I think this was one of the best kept secrets. Someone always blabs, so I'm so thrilled no one spilled. Think the last 20% of this bk put it over the top for me. That's when you hit the \\"Uh Oh\\" moment.  Following along not knowing where the heck this bk was going only to have things wrapped up shockingly but satisfying at the end. Resolved? NO WAY, but at least I can breathe a sigh of relief that the tension with Gideon/Eva is over for now. Do they have some HUGE stuff to sort, you betcha, but still a big High Five to Syliva Day for this wowza. Bk 3 is gonna be some kind of interesting. This bk picks up immediately where the first left off, so a refresher is in order if you haven't read Bared to You in a while. Gideon and Eva are one totally dysfunctional duo but DAMN are these two hot together. Break out the fan and the cold water, sistahs. How about that backseat car scene? And who didn't rub their hands together with giddy glee when Gideon throws down over Eva in a fit of alpha jealous possessive rage. A positively swooning wonder moment for me.  Gideon, Gideon you poor sad, intense, damaged boy, so glad you've found Eva to complete you. Love Eva's spunk when she's had it with Gideon's crap and when she stands by her man. Love this girl! My mind can't even comprehend where bk 3 will go. I just know that I don't want to miss it. Will be waiting anxious to click \\"buy\\" on release day.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|Have had this for several weeks now.  The Kindle Fire fits closely, and the material is strong.  Although it is only a strap of elastic band holding it shut, it appears secure and the screen is well-protected.  The shell does not work very well to prop up the Kindle, although it's not a problem most of the time.
B0099G4Y26|1.0|Loved the last cd but very disappointed with this one.  I have only listened to 3/4 of it and probably will not listen to it again.  Obviously the song blow me one last kiss is the only exception.

B008KOMMTA|5.0|The film looks amazing and the 3D is awesome! The extra's in the box are VERY Cool! Well worth the price of admission!
B004XWMXW4|1.0|Get something from Matthew Schoening or The Piano Guys, these guys suck, most of it was just chaotic noise and more noise
B009329ZF2|5.0|Full of action in the style of Transformers. The TV trailers did NOT do it justice. I had to watch an internet trailer before I was interested. My wife and I thought the movie is a \\"sleeper\\" that will find favor on the cable channels.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved the book! It's a very easy and quick read. Though you definately have to have an open mind when reading it and I'm almost through the second book now and I love it!!!!! AMAZING READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A lot fun so far. Very addicting for such a simple concept. Only been playing for a few minutes. Its a great way to kill some time.
B00009N828|5.0|I was looking for this movie to send as a gift for someone that I know who was wanting to see this movie for a long time. Price is great and item was in excellent condition. The person really enjoyed the film and has watched this movie several times. Thankyou.
B008J05EL8|1.0|This should be included with the purchased app.  Now I can't read my old documents so it either pay 5 dollars or remove and use the competition that came with my phone.  This is a ridiculous money grab. Goodbye OfficeSuite.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest!! so many fun and creative ideas to share. I look forward to using this app a lot more!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game but wish we could earn coins faster!  Just can't justify buying them!! I can sit and play all day!!  It has overtaken Words with Friends as my favorite.  Lighten up on giving us coins!!
0140135154|5.0|Quite philosophical and deep explanation on oil paintings and photographs... very impressive and sharp insights by bringing in historical background at the time when such media were introduced or available. At times difficult to read due to such complex concepts and sophisticated descriptions, but overall quite revealing and enlightening and at times even hilarious (especially about nudity and nakedness, how man got a nude lady with a mirror painted so that he could enjoy watching while blaming for her vanity). Very sharp account on today's publicity and advertisement and how that affect us. The font type (bold sans-serif) is very uncomfortable to read but the content is so interesting that I didn't mind very much.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game great for killing time. some. controls could. use a little work. like the snake game on the 2nd page.
B002F6FQGK|4.0|This is a master piece... it deserves more awards, the songs are going to be with us for a long long time.<br /><br />T famous
1451627297|5.0|THIS is the type of Stephen King I so enjoy. (not into horror) His reseach is tremendous and his character development is the best. You like all the characters. Great book. A+
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This is the best return I have ever had on any MP3 purchase; Florence is a flood, an outburst, she is a storm; there is no way you will not be swept away.<br /><br />T famous
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I absolutely love this album!  Every time I hear a song I think that they can't match it in quality again, then they put out something new and I am amazed all over again.  It's clear that they love what they do, and they love to share their talents with the world.  This album has so many of their wonderful songs, and well worth the investment.  If you are on the fence about buying it, BUY IT!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love story all in all.  everyone wants to be loved and charished and this  gives  you    the fantasy wrapped in Christain Grey and Ana Steele.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I'd have to say I liked Bared to You better than this sequel.  But I really enjoy Eva and Gideon's characters and story, so I did enjoy the book for the most part. Some parts more than others. A few things seemed a bit off. Since when does she call him \\"Ace\\" all of a sudden? And I don't remember the shoulder length hair in the first book. The romantic moments in this one were pretty moving. And the love scenes still pretty hot. The last third was pretty predictable. This one seemed vey similar to Gabriel's Inferno/Gabriel's Rapture. Too similar. I am definitely looking forward to the third installment though, that's for sure.
B008RTE09S|5.0|I don't care if its their home movies and their just sitting humming, making breakfast, watching tv, getting the mail.....IT'S THE BEATLES!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game can't stop playing!  I recommend this game for everyone that just needs to relax and not be bothered with ads or interruptions
0743243153|5.0|It took me a long time to get through this book because I wanted to think deeply often.  I think everyone should read this book at least once, if not more.
0374275637|5.0|I don't buy books for others unless I am sure tat the book is so interesting that it will be read. This is one you can't go wrong with. I enjoyed it a lot. It opens new perspectives about the way we think and decide. Both, my system 1 and system 2 agree.
030758836X|3.0|Overall I enjoyed the book. The story was a clever concept and the characters were well written, I was thoroughly engrossed. But the ending was such a disappointment it almost made reading it a waste of time. I felt the author might be leaving the story open for a sequel, the ending was too unlikely and vague. After investing time in the story and feeling so unsatisfied by it's end, I wouldn't read the next.
0307592731|5.0|This was truly an enthralling read. I have family in the west and understand the attraction of the mountains. They are real entities and humans are drawn to them. To hike this trail as a single person and a woman who has never done any extensive hiking is unbelievable. Her personal history was such an integral part of her tolerating pain in the feet. It was an atonement kind of like cutting yourself.<br />I may be way off the on this but whatever, it was a five star book.<br />  Sue Schoettmer
0743564383|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time and I thought I would listen to it on a long trip, so I purchased the audio version through Audible.com.  [[ASIN:B004NCR4BE For Whom the Bell Tolls Publisher: Simon & Schuster Audio; Unabridged edition]] turned out to be a great investment and listening to the book refreshed my memories and gave me the feeling of experiencing the book again for the first time.<br /><br />I won't spend much time reviewing the book itself because nearly everything which can be said about it has already been said.  I can only add my voice to those praising the wonderful cadence of Hemingway's dialogue and the haunting, descriptive narrative as he works through how the politics of war have changed all his characters, reducing them to little more than animals living in caves, sometimes predators and sometimes prey.<br /><br />Hemingway was sympathetic in real life to the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War (against the Fascists), but he does not completely spare them in his portrayal of the levels of brutality to which men stoop in a war pitting citizens of a single country against each other.  Hemingway also spares little sympathy on the ignorance and stupidity of some in command of the Republican Army, nor the callousness of those on the elite periphery, as preparations are made for the novel's pivotal moment.<br /><br />The narrative in the audio version is by Campbell Scott.  He is a very soft spoken performer who took some getting used to.  I imagined this novel would be read in a more forceful way, more like I imagined Hemingway himself might have read it, but Mr. Scott's voice is very measured and while heroic, virile male characters like the republican guerrilla fighters, characters like Pablo and El Sordo, may have been slightly underplayed, his careful narration allowed him to give depth to female characters, especially Pilar.<br /><br />I have listened to many audiobooks and one of the most annoying things can be male narrators trying to do female characters and completely blowing it.  A failure on this level can take you right out of the story and completely ruin the experience of listening to the book.<br /><br />Mr. Scott avoids this and is able to voice the female characters without it sounding like a parody.  This is incredibly important with this book because the female characters are prominent and very strong. Another problem some narrators encounter is accents; again, a failure here ruins the book.  Mr. Scott never overplays any of the characters, giving each one of them credible distinctions without ever descending in stereotype.<br /><br />When I had finished listening to the book I realized that Mr. Scott, by achieving this balance with supporting characters, had given nearly perfect voice to the measured, methodical and logical voice of American Robert Jordon, the main character.

A failure on this level can take you right out of the story and completely ruin the experience of listening to the book.<br /><br />Mr. Scott avoids this and is able to voice the female characters without it sounding like a parody.  This is incredibly important with this book because the female characters are prominent and very strong. Another problem some narrators encounter is accents; again, a failure here ruins the book.  Mr. Scott never overplays any of the characters, giving each one of them credible distinctions without ever descending in stereotype.<br /><br />When I had finished listening to the book I realized that Mr. Scott, by achieving this balance with supporting characters, had given nearly perfect voice to the measured, methodical and logical voice of American Robert Jordon, the main character.

B0062QFZ10|4.0|A rave review for this CD in The Gramophone prompted the disappointed two-star reviews here, and now there is a 2012 Gramophone Award in the concerto category to add to the laurels. One of the two-star reviewers has a point, I think, about the Berg concerto. The engineers have miked the violin far forward and the orchestra backward, giving the impression of an aggressive soloist whose every note stands out. In actual performance, Berg entwined solo and orchestra in such a way that there is much interplay, and the soloist is often subsumed into the overall sound picture. If that aspect of the Berg Cto. is important to you - as it is to me - the lovely, nuanced reading from Daniel Hope is one to seek out.<br /><br />On its own terms, this is an engrossing recording, for two reasons. The close miking that somewhat falsifies the piece has the advantage of letting us hear everything that Isabelle Faust, who turns 40 this year has to say. One notes immediately that we are long past the era when even the most accomplished virtuosos basically had no personal interpretations - they were doing their utmost to get through the hard parts and make sense of the 12-tone idiom. Now a new generation of violinists finds Berg's idiom second nature, and they have led our ears as listeners. The idiom remains highly intellectual and difficult to follow, but the high drama that Berg delivers, the many moods, the compassionate melancholy, and references to the past, mostly notably in the chorale quoted from Bach's Ich habe Genug are not hard to follow at all.<br /><br />These elements are most beautiful when the orchestra is fully involved, and I wouldn't say that abbado's accompaniment is as engrossing as others. Still, he has championed Berg throughout his career and knows is way around the score, far more than the generic efforts of, say Seiji Ozawa with Perlman. On the other hand, the Orchestra Mozart, which up to now has recorded as a period-instrument ensemble, isn't up to the great orchestras that can make Berg sound as romantic and emotionally turbulent as Mahler. In all, this is a personal account from Faust that is impressive but not, for me, an award-winner.<br /><br />The Beethoven Cto. uses the same balances as in the Berg, placing the soloist (who plays a 1704 Stradivarius) ahead and apart form the orchestra. I enjoyed the placement better here, however, because Faust is strong in the solo part and adds many personal details. In the first movement she and Abbado are quicker and more aggressive than I anticipated, in a forceful style that leaves behind all those tame, sweet-toned readings that this concerto has attracted. At times Faust's tone is rough-edged, but she applies enough variety that the lyrical nature of the first movement isn't lost. She plays the very odd, freewheeling cadenza that Beethoven wrote when he turned the score into a piano concerto - the prominent side-drum part will make you think you've taken a wrong turn into Wellington's victory. Faust has edited the cadenza, by the way.<br /><br />The opening of the slow movement is hushed and reverent, offering a marked contrast with the first movement. Faust follows suit by singing the solo line in a quiet, intense manner that makes the listener lean forward. This isn't Oistrakh dominating the scene but more like the obbligato solo violin in the Benedictus movement of the Missa Solemnis. Happily, Faust isn't passive; as in the first movement she has ideas. For me, the only letdown was the finale, which sets off at a lively pace and doesn't lose energy, but Faust miniaturizes the solo part almost to a squeak at times. I'm not a fan of small-voiced Beethoven, but others may find that her vivaciousness and quickness win the day. If you like the finale to scamper, it does.<br /><br />In all, this is an appealing pairing that would attract attention any year. As much as Russian violinists are dominant today, the Germans still seem to understand Beethoven and Berg better. Alongwith Tetzlaff, Zimmermann, and Steinbacher, Faust shows that Beethoven especially remains alive and interesting to musicians at a high level.with Tetzlaff, Zimmermann, and Steinbacher, Faust shows that Beethoven especially remains alive and interesting to musicians at a high level.

B004V9J3HM|5.0|Testimony II is a sequel to Neal Morse's \\"Testimony\\" album that he put out after leaving Spock's Beard.  Both albums detail Neal's struggle through the music industry, finally finding success in middle age, and eventually becoming a Christian both musically and in his personal life.  The 2 albums serve as a musical biography of Neal's life up to this point.  The first album is still my favorite Morse solo disc, but this one may beat it.  The story is compelling and heartfelt.  The music is outstanding through both discs.  Yes, Neal sometimes can be a bit formulamatic, but boy can he come up with some incredible stuff.  Even the boys from Spock's Beard make an appearance on the rocking track \\"Time Changer\\" and although he is not credited, that sure as hell sounds like Nick D'Virgillio singing harmony vocals on \\"Supernatural\\" from the 2nd disc.  Other highlights include \\"Nighttime Collectors\\" that chronicle his tours with Eric Burdon's band, and the epic closer of disc 2 called \\"Seeds Of Gold\\".  I love this album from start to finish and although it is Christian themed, I think anyone could dig this album.  Morse does it again!

B008FSCNTK|2.0|I previewed the songs on Amazon prior to buying the CD and it fell flat on my ears.  I love Diana when she's doing jazz, but this just isn't my kind of music.  She does jazz vocal and 40's genre far better.  Maybe she ran out of material in that arena.  Perhaps write her own songs with the same sound that she does best??

B008MG1E4A|4.0|There has been a lot written or shown about the mission that killed OBL.  I did now find this book to tell<br />a lot more than others.  In most, if not all, of these books you read a lot about how tough it is to become<br />a Navy Seal.  This is true I am sure.  I do not want to take anything away from what these people go through.<br /><br />I have read about 4 books that go through this program.  It is interesting, but it becomes self adulation<br />after a while.<br /><br />There was a little new information that I found very interesting.  President Obama has surely taken a victory<br />lap over the raid.  He did authorize it, but it took him a long time and he did not make the decision without<br />laying down a cover for himself should it have failed. He also gave away many things that would have been<br />better left secret.  A lot of this, we really do not need to know about.  This is especially true when we are<br />discussing intelligence concerning our enemies.<br /><br />This is a good book to read if you do not know much about the raid.  The news media has distorted what really<br />happened.  Through the author's account you learn what he says happened.  I would probably believe him before<br />either the White House or the media.
0425263908|3.0|I read this book for book club. Everyone, or most of us, had already read at least one of the Fifty Shades books. I reviewed all three on my blog last year before all of the controversy started. So, with Fifty out of the running, Bared to You came up.<br /><br /> What did I think of the book? Well...they were either thinking about having sex, having sex, or just finished having sex and thinking about the next time. Everyone (book club) agreed that there appeared to be a plot in the beginning, but it somehow fizzled out - you know - with all of the thinking about sex, having sex, or thinking about sex again.<br /><br /> I, along with several other members of book club, finished the book feeling as though we were only given half the book. There were several different characters brought in to the story that could have - and hopefully will in the second book - been a little more developed and at least one of the avenues explored and resolved. The book literally just ended and left you hanging and unsatisfied; unless you remember the having sex, thinking about sex...<br /><br /> I am rating the book a 3 simply because nothing was resolved in the first book, and I think that it is crucial to at least resolve and bring closure to something, before heading off to write book two.
B008O037RG|3.0|After two powerful opening tracks this album settles into a lull.  One slow angsty introspective song blends into another until it become formulaic and stale.<br /><br />It would probably get 2 stars but then comes The Boxer which is just a terrific cover of Simon & Garfunkel.  I sat there scratching my head thinking \\"when you can play like this why did you put the last 10 tracks on the album?\\"<br /><br />Hopefully in their next album they are a bit more adventurous - reduce the # of tracks and increase the variety without losing their charm.

Nice to curl up with Kindlel & enjoy reading a good book. SuperNova is so easy to use we can enjoy our favorite tunes or I can even catch a movie while cruising with my hubby on the Harley.

My absolute favorite continues to be Kindle for Android!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams was one of the main architects of American independence, yet he remains one of the least known of them.  He was never listed among the giants of independence, such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, or Thomas Jefferson; however, without his strong guidance and leadership, such an accomplishment may have been unattainable.  This miniseries finally gives Adams the recognition that he deserves.  Paul Giamatti plays Adams to perfection, and the rest of the cast play their parts commendably.  The miniseries has a definite ring of authenticity to it, and the script doesn't shy away from the problems that afflicted the Adams family.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in that period of American history.

1423113454|4.0|Carter Kane and his sister Sadie only have one thing in common:  they have the same parents....that, and they are fiercely jealous of one another.<br /><br />They have so many differences:  Carter resembles his African-American father; Sadie, their white mother.  Carter is careful and thoughtful; Sadie, impulsive and outspoken.  Carter lives with his father, flying all over the world on wild archaeological digs; Sadie, in London with her grandparents and only sees her father and brother one day a year.<br /><br />Combine all that with a family mystery steeped in ancient Egyptain myth and you have a brand new series full of fun.<br /><br />Like all Riordan's teen novels, this one focuses on mythology but Egyptian mythology rather than Greek or Roman.  I found the mythology fascinating but much more intricate and harder to understand (that, or I am clueless about this brand of mythology).  This series has all the earmarks of other good Riordan reads--adventures, mystery, teens who must save the world with their own wit and bravery.<br /><br />What's not to love?  I can't wait for the next installment.

I intend to find out.

I would recommend this book to anyone hoping to get their writing publishing

0439023521|4.0|I had not read \\"The Hunger Games\\" up to now because I figured it was typical young adult literature. It is indeed that, but it is better than most of the young adult work out there. I would be lying if I said I was not caught up in the text and that there were times when I could have just sat and read and read.<br />I realize that the text has some flaws and that it is not all that deep a story, although to a teenager it would seem to be, but it is not targeted to the mature reader so why would I expect it to be mature in its themes and presentation? As a text it is well written, and very excellently plotted. There are also some very thoughtful lines in the book that will give something extra to the more mature young adult reader, and will be missed by the immature reader with no harm done.<br />A quibble with the novel would be that the romantic subplot at times veers too much into stereotypical teenage love, and when Ms. Collins focuses on that aspect of the plot the writing is noticeably weaker. To her credit though, the romantic angle is incorporated into the story in a clever and unconventional manner.<br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is a great example of a gripping thriller that is written in a well executed style that will blow away most young readers, and impress and entertain older ones. I greatly enjoyed the text, and will read the following two novels in the trilogy. That sounds like a successful book to me.
