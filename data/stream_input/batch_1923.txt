B008N2Z1L0|4.0|I saw their recent concert on tv and liked it better than I thought I would. The songs grew on me after a few listens.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have seen the stage musical 8 times as this is my all time favorite musical. I could not wait for the movie to be released and I was not disappointed. It is a spectacular epic of a film. The film opened up the play to incredible effect. Not one song or scene was cut. The cast was superb. Hugh Jackman, who I saw on Broadway in \\"The Boy From Oz\\", was superb and has a great voice, as was Anne Hathaway. Russel Crowe is not the best singer, but was excellent in his role. I can find no fault at all with this film adaption. When the last note was sung, the audience burst into applause.<br /><br />There has been a lot of negative criticism. I think the critics made up their mind before they saw the movie that they were going to find fault. And who are these idiots? They are strangers to me. Why should I take the word of someone I don't know who tells me what I should see and not see. These are the people who raved about \\"The Book of Mormon\\" which is the single worst musical I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />So ignore the so called critics. Be your own voice. Word of mouth is strong. This movie is magnificent. I cannot wait for the Blu-Ray to come out. In the meantime, I'm going back to the theatre to see it again.<br /><br />So now I have the Blu-Ray and what a magnificent picture and sound on this disc. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Highly recommended. One of the greatest musicals of all time. A stirring brilliant score.
1594203334|5.0|This book reveals differences in ways to interact with children, based on the author's experiences in Paris. I found it helpful to take a step back from what is normal in America and learn about another culture. There are definitely some French practices that made sense to me, that I will encorporate when interacting with my babies. This book focuses on babies and toddlers, so read it when your kids are young! Or even better when pregnant. Do most French babies sleep through the night at 3 months and eat a large variety of foods when toddlers? Who knows but it's worth a shot!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A wonderful celebration of aging with a first-rate cast.  Maggie Smith delightfully departs from her usual aristocratic character; Judi Dench and Bill Nighy take on the strange with imaginative resolution; Penelope Wilton is wonderfully wilting...anything else would spoil the plot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have previously read Slammed and Point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover and enjoyed both. Hopeless wow, the characters were everything you want in a book. The chemisty between Sky and Holder is what all authors try to emulate and not always achieve. It was realistic and emotional. Make sure you schedule time to read the book from cover to cover because you will not be able to put it down! I look forward to reading future books by the author as she has progressed into an amazing writer.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Winter of the World continues the saga of three families as they endure the events of the early twentieth century in four countries.  The book accurately portrays history in detail and how the people of the US, Russia, Germany and Great Britain endure the changing world.  The book is very well written and once you start reading, you can't put it down.  Definately read the trilogy in order.

031620157X|5.0|I loved this book! When I was younger I used to fantasize about what happened beyond the &#34;happily ever after&#34;. I like the way Chris Colfer gives some closure to my childhood fairy tales. This book is not bedtime tales.

B005LAIII0|4.0|A 2001 novel of the same name by Yann Martel is the basis for \\"Life of Pi\\" and it has been called unfilmable. The movie has been in the works since 2003, but the nature of the film has caused many to think that it would never be possible. See, most of the film involves a boy in a lifeboat with an adult Bengal Tiger. The movie also involves many other challenging things to portray, including a massive shipwreck, an island of meerkats and a strong religious overtone that manages to be fair to all religions. Suraj Sharma plays Pi Patel, a boy becoming a man who challenges all conventional thinking as he leads his life. Curious about religion and religions, he prides himself in knowing not just one god, but all gods. Not to mention, despite its obvious carnivorous nature, he has faith that a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker has a soul and can be befriended.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" has many levels and as visually stimulating as it is, it is also mentally stimulating and beautiful in its intent. I'm not completely sure it achieved all that it intended but the gist of its message comes across loud and clear. Life is a gift and the days ahead are not guaranteed. Faith is vital in living a rewarding life and in knowing how life is not only to be lived, but to be cherished for each and every moment. I'm pretty sure that was the gist.<br /><br />Above all, \\"Life of Pi\\" is not just a well-filmed movie, but a gloriously well filmed film. The quality levels of the filming are unprecedented and its 3D makes all 3D that has been done prior look like the second and third-rate stuff that it is. The effects used to bring the tiger Richard Parker to life are awe-inspiring. Your eyes widen, as they should, when Parker strikes and when he nears. There has certainly never before been a movie that gives you the impression of what it would be like to be and live in the proximity of such a beast.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" comes off a little heavy-handed at time and I have to admit that I assumed there would be more to it, but the amount there is to it is in the eye of the beholder. You can look at the movie and say that it wasn't about much, or you can look at the movie and say that it was about everything, because it is. The performances are outstanding, including the Tiger, and the film is without question, one of the best of 2012.med there would be more to it, but the amount there is to it is in the eye of the beholder.

0545265355|4.0|well worth the read; but i got it as a gift for a traveling friend...so i was disappointed to discover i'd overlooked the fact that they were hardbound books.  i went back to the website and confirmed that the trilogy is not yet available in paperback.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|\\"Jack Reacher\\" is based on a 2005 novel called \\"One Shot\\" in which the title character, Jack Reacher, is a drifter and former military police officer who has elite skills. Having no knowledge of the character or the book series, I am seeing this movie without any prior knowledge of what the character is supposed to be. Many of the loyal fans are upset about the casting of Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Apparently, in the novel, Reacher is intended to be homeless looking, 6'5\\" tall and blonde. Tom Cruise is none of those. Although the author, Lee Child, has been known to say, \\"Reacher's size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force, which Cruise portrays in his own way. With another actor you might get 100% of the height but only 90% of Reacher. With Tom, you'll get 100% of Reacher with 90% of the height.\\" That being said, I completely understand what he's talking about.<br /><br />\\"Jack Reacher\\" is without question something that will continuously pique your interest. Never a dull moment, it is part mystery, part legal drama, part action flick and part comedy. The comedy is rare, but there. In light of recent incidents, the subject matter may be tough to watch, but it also adds to the disdain for the villains. The movie starts out with 6 people gunned down in Pittsburgh by a sniper. Much of the setup is told without dialogue and it effectively sucks you into a mystery. The best part about \\"Reacher\\" is that the movie allows you, the audience, to play along, figuring things out along with Reacher. The clues are uncharacteristically plentiful but Reacher looks at things a completely different way.<br /><br />I'm not gonna judge \\"Reacher\\" based on the books, but on the movie, and it is good. It the kind of movie you can't take your eyes off of, for fear of missing something. It is the kind of action movie that movies like \\"Alex Cross\\" should have been. It is the kind of action movie that proves Tom Cruise to be one of the best action stars we have today. He's become such a great action movie actor, that he makes the cast of \\"Expendables 1 & 2\\" look like has-beens. Sorry, but Tom Cruise's action movies have substance and acting chops. There are no Bruce Willis' hanging from F-15's or endless gunfire. He doesn't just blow things up and shoot things up, he has a brain, and so do his movies.such a great action movie actor, that he makes the cast of \\"Expendables 1 & 2\\" look like has-beens.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Heard this movie was terrible but I love Family Guy, Mila Kunis is hot, Joel McHale is hilarious, so I ignored that and watched it anyway.<br /><br />I kept waiting for it to get good.

B005S9EKCW|4.0|One hundred and fifty years ago, Victor Hugo wrote the novel for \\"Les Miserables\\" and it has been told and retold many ways and in many fashions. This film version has been in the works for almost as long as the story spans in years. That would be thirty. The sweeping scope and scale of its premise, I would guess are not the reason for the delay, but the method of story-telling was most likely polarizing and some movie studio finally said, \\"Oh, why not.\\"<br /><br />This version is like no other. It is a reflection of the stage musical, in which everything is sung. Dialogue and songs are blended together. To make things even trickier, much of the movie was filmed and portrayed live. The music was played on set and the actors were saddled with singing the songs without cuts and bringing the required emotion to it, as actors. At times, this technique is brilliant and beautiful, and at times the risk of this technique rears its ugly head. One thing can be said, this is an incredibly gutsy attempt at filmmaking by director Tom Hooper and there are moments so gut-wrenching and emotional they leave you breathless.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman and Amanda Seyfried are actors who are meant for the stage. The casting of these three actor/actress' is none short of brilliant. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Fantine is perfect and her performance of the popular song, \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is so good, you hang on every word of it, feeling every drenching gasp of her emotions. Amanda Seyfried's portrayal of Cosette is simply defined by her method of singing. Her voice is full of a rare combination of soul, peace and beauty, exactly what Cosette should be.  Hugh Jackman plays Jean Valjean, a man who spent 19-years in prison for stealing bread for his dying sister. There is really nothing to be said about his performance, other than brilliant. He was meant for this.<br /><br />I would be amiss not to mention Eddie Redmayne as well for his performance as Marius Pontmercy. Much has been said publicly and nationally about the other three stars in this film, but Pontmercy holds his own along-side Hathaway, Jackman and Seyfried.<br /><br />\\"Les Miserables\\" is gifted with beautiful voices, but at times, as an audience member, you become aware of the length of the movie. There are many songs that sound alike and much of the time when the actors are singing their dialogue, it all sounds the same and monotonous.  There are moments in this film that are absolutely epic in scale and simplicity and there are moments that will drag you down to snooze land.<br /><br />\\"Les Miserables\\" is not for the moviegoer who thinks they would like to try and see if they like musicals. If you don't typically like musicals or musical theatre, you will most likely not enjoy it. Although if you do, you will want to trudge through some of the heavier and slower parts of this movie to get to the moments of greatness that occur. When movies are sung, especially ones like this where it is 100% sung, that means that every single emotion and plot point are fleshed out and explored to the hilt, for four or five minutes. Some of those plot points are less interesting or less vital than others. The ones that are vital though are worth wading through the others.s been said publicly and nationally about the other three stars in this film, but Pontmercy holds his own along-side Hathaway, Jackman and Seyfried.<br /><br />\\"Les Miserables\\" is gifted with beautiful voices, but at times, as an audience member, you become aware of the length of the movie.

B0059XTU1S|5.0|Are you ready to return to middle-earth? Why wouldn't you be? Peter Jackson, with the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, brought us to a place that many thought wasn't possible except in the written form. A product of many of our childhoods, J.R.R. Tolkien constructed an elaborate world of wizards, trolls, elves, dwarves, humans and most importantly Hobbits. It is an elaborately detailed world of maps, homelands, stories and adventures. It couldn't possibly be realized anywhere close to what J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination did. Yet, Jackson pulled it off better than anyone could have hoped. Now, he's trying again.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" is a step backward into the history of middle-earth. It is quite simply the adventure that Bilbo Baggins takes that leads to him writing his book, \\"There and back again\\". Peter Jackson is trying to do the unthinkable with this trilogy, duplicate the magic he pulled off before. Much can be told from this first installment and whether or not the magic is still there.<br /><br />The movie, filmed at twice frame-speed as traditional film (48 frames) has many geeks talking about how it will look too real. Ultimately, at 48 frames, it could look as crisp and real as a soap opera. Well, first of all, with a film like this, it takes a lot of guts to attempt such a thing; a movie with such obvious special effects and makeup. Yet, the opposite could also be achieved; a level of escapism and realism that not only delivers a quality movie experience, but also sucks you into a world that you don't want to leave.<br /><br />Peter Jackson has learned a few things from his first trilogy and you can see it in \\"The Hobbit\\". This world is even more realized. The characters are more fleshed out. Richard Armitage's depiction of Thorin is full of heart and passion. The faithfulness to the book itself is even more realized. More importantly, the journey is even more colorful and creative.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" is a lot of the same. It's another journey full of adventure and trolls, dwarves and orcs, but again, it is a quality journey. The escapism you feel in this film is like nothing you've ever felt before. When it was time to go, at the end of the film, I didn't want to. I was there. I was in middle-earth, ready to take the journey ahead with Bilbo, Gandolff and the band of Dwarves. I didn't care about length or how long I had been sitting there. I was invested. That, is really all any movie can do.dventure and trolls, dwarves and orcs, but again, it is a quality journey.

B008XG1X18|4.0|App is ok, I prefer doing this on the computer where I can see everything & have more access to what I want to look at. I haven't figured out how to fully use this app yet. I suppose when I figure it out more it'll be more of a 5 star purchase.

B005LAII62|4.0|I only gave 4 stars because the movie is supported to be kind of like Coraline. the story line was ok, the animation is very off, my husband explained to me it's claymation so it's never perfect. But the Mom' s face is repulsive. But my kids LOVED the movie & said nothing of the animation, so that's what matters.

B004BSFC46|5.0|We recieved so many gifts with the birth of our first daughter, and many were toys. Well, this one bet them all! My daughter is 9 months and this is still one of only two toys that can make her stop crying in an instant and smile. (The other \\"toy\\" that can do this, oddly enough, is the stapula from the baby bullet. Its small and perfectly fits in her hand. She loves to weild that thing around and hit all sorts of things to listen to the different sounds. Ha!)<br />Bottom line: this toy is so good I am buying a second one in case, *gasp*, she ever loses it!
B00ARAO720|2.0|very weak and predictable. Only liked it for cycling scenes but they were made for lay people.  Would not recommend to anyone.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book had so much promise when I started it. I thought it had such a whimsical nature and a sweet character portrayal. It's plot was subtle yet it was gripping in it's flashbacks and it's subtext.<br />Unfortunately the end was extremely disappointing. It was far fetched to say the least and it had bitter undertones with some very prejudiced views  the author obviously felt toward Catholics lending to the unsupportable final conclusion.

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|First of all, I really liked the love story. The premise about the two main characters getting together over a bet felt a little thin, but I went along with it because I really liked the characters.<br /><br />I thought the beginning was especially engaging--in fact, after reading the first six pages around dinnertime I had to put everything else on hold and I finished the book at 1AM that night. A book hasn't done that to me in a long time. The author doesn't beat around the bush, she just jumps right into the story, and I was hooked right away. I also liked that it was a simple romance but had enough going on that I wasn't bored, and the character of Travis was interesting, though dysfunctional. And I liked that it contained several well-written \\"adult\\" love scenes, even if they were a little on the generic side.<br /><br />That being said, there were a couple of plot problems that I noted. Travis beats the HELL out of several people during the course of the story (excluding the people he pummels in the underground 'fight club'-type boxing matches he participates in), and nobody ever presses charges against him, or even questions him about it. NOBODY. Not the campus police, not the fraternity president, not the university. Riiiight. Then, later, though he's portrayed throughout the book as a booksmart, tough-as-nails lady-killer, he's on his knees whimpering for Abby outside a cafeteria full of people? That was a little hard to believe. And there's a scene at the end where many people are killed tragically, and the main characters don't seem all that affected by it even though they were involved.<br /><br />ENDING - It ends on a happy note, but it felt a little cliched.<br /><br />One thing to note: this book is very dialog heavy. If you like a lot of narrative or description, you will find it lacking. For me, it was fast-paced and easy to read. Overall, I'd highly recommend it.

I have two complaints; first the lid doesn't stay on really well when it's being carried around.  For at home, it's not a big deal.  When taking it to grandma's house and carrying other things, it's a problem, although only a small one.  Second complaint, I wish they had other versions (for Barbie)!  I'd totally buy more of these for my daughter if they did.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|I'm very pleased with the controller. I have no interest in FPS or racing games with on-screen controls. But with the controller, I can actually play N.O.V.A. 3 now. I also tried Asphalt 7 and Wild Blood. The controller works flawlessly with all of these titles.<br /><br />The only downside so far is that the number of supported titles is quite limited. Hopefully, Gameloft will add more supported games in the future.

B005LAII80|4.0|I liked this movie for several reasons. It has maybe 5 minutes or so of no action, otherwise its full throttle. Another is the use of the different ammo types the guns use, especially that they are DNA coded to each particular judge (have to kind of know that part). And thirdly, I am a huge fan of the \\"climb the tower\\" type of action film; a favorite being 'The Raid Redemption'. if you like this type of movie, this is for you. If you haven't checked out 'The Raid', and like this type of movie, I suggest you add it to your must see list.

It has many scary moments that makes you quiver when you think about it. One word to describe this book would be EXCELLENT!!!! However I would not recommend this book for younger readers due to strong language, sexual material, and disturbing material. If you are a Stephen King fan, YOU WILL ADORE THIS BOOK!!!

If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go--especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil--and also her father.<br /><br />To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings--and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?<br /><br />In this breathtaking sequel to City of Bones, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.<br /><br />My opinion:<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  Cassandra Clare has a way of captivating her audience. She has a unique way of including all aspects of life making you feel like this world could actually exist. The stars of the series fight the same issues we do just in a more open atmosphere filled with creatures of the night, demons of all things scary, warlocks, and other unique oddities.  The love you can feel between Jace and Clary is so obvious and open.  You can't help but feel sorry for Simon's character as he seems to be the one that suffers the most in this particular book but at the same time, you can tell that possibly he has some good tidings heading his way.  The little tidbit of information that the author gives out here and there pointing at more possibilities to come for each character can be so frustrating at times, BUT it's what causes you to keep on moving to the next one.  That need to know what happens next is so strong that I already bought the next one in the series.  I hope it doesn't disappoint!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book! It has so much voice and personality and you fall in love with each of the characters. Half the time I really felt like i was receiving letters from a boy named Charlie. I grew to love Charlie with all my heart.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|One of the BEST games I have played.I would by it all over .I'm grandkids like it to. I had to take the Grandkids  home so I could  play.
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|Her music is perfect to listen on vinyl. It's classy and soothing. Her music is amazing! I can't wait to add the Paradise Edition to my collection as well.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Great CD. The best CD yet for the Black Keys musical group. Their &#34;Brothers&#34; was excellent, this one is better.
B009HXGD4S|5.0|Wes Anderson does a great job of elevating this movie to the level of art as he makes strong use of color and music to bolster his major themes. Additionally,  the story and acting contained in this movie are superb thanks to excellent casting and writing. I purchased this on amazon as a digital copy stored in the cloud and that had led to some buyer's remorse as I didn't notice that the amazon instant video service is limited to select devices (unfortunately my phone is not one such device).  Overall I'm happy to own this film and am sure I will will enjoy it again and again on devices other than my phone.
B003Y74KC0|5.0|Fits the phone like a skin and it protects it very well from moisture on the counters and drops on the floor in the tile kitchen.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Its lighthearted and it made us laugh. A very good family movie. would recomend highly to people with children. great
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Ever since I saw Susan Sing her first song I loved her.  She has a beautiful voice and I now have 3 of her CD's.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I'm a sucker for a good love story and this certainly met all the requirements :) I actually cried at a couple parts!! Can't decide if I want to read Walking Disaster or not, kind of sounds like a repeat of this whole story, just from Travis' point of view.. We'll see!
B00914JWSW|5.0|I have most of Barbra's CD's.  This one is excellent and I enjoyed the relaxed feeling I got when she sings.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read this book based off seeing the previews for the movie... I must say, for being such a sad premiss, this book was actually funny (in a quirky way) at parts and the love that Pat has for his mother and ends up having for Tiffany is heartwarming. The characters had so much depth without the author flooding the reader with words. I really enjoyed this one.
630514415X|5.0|Very good movie. I bought this just to add to my personal movie collection. Good price. Glad I did. Buy it now!
B008HSJV7A|2.0|The first two were pretty great but I thought this one was a little uneventful. It seems like it was just setting up for its sequels but didn't make for a great story by any means.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Heath played an amazing Joker. I bought this just to add to my personal movie collection. Good price. Glad I did.
B0031TZ8TU|4.0|Great detailed adventure into an historical event. What ever happened to &#34;Dagmar&#34; ? Sometimes too much detail of personalities involoved.
1612680003|5.0|I haven't gotten around to reading this yet but I have always heard good things about the book so I bought my own copy. I'll try to update it once I read it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I started watching this when my children were about six years old and they loved it.<br />it has become a tradition  in the family. my children showed it to theirs and so on down the line. Sometimes we all get together<br />and watch it. a wonderful classic.
1594488843|5.0|I bought this as an assigned book for a class. Found it on here for a great price. It is still a useful reference for me occasionally. It was actually a good book and was useful when I wrote my thesis around the topic of motivation
B000SGRONM|5.0|The holidays can be difficult for many of us. I opened this book to find a few laughs amid bittersweet memories and family gaggles. It was well worth it. Sedaris brings just the right sardonic touch to his tales of growing up in suburbia, his first jobs, and, primarily, his life as an elf. Alas, Sedaris also reminded me that men see humor from a certain angle, and I found myself missing the writings of the late Nora Ephon. We need a new funny woman on the horizon!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great books and better movies. Awesome. My kids love it and watch it constantly. like three times in a row constantly.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This story clearly demonstrates the need faith in peoples' lives, both to prevent tragedies such as occurred in this story and to help people to whom such tragedies do occur.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|What a great movie for kids. My kids have watched the movie at least a dozen times since they got it.
B000L53D4O|2.0|I bought this walker for my 11 month old son. He walks holding onto furniture all the time. But, he showed no interest in the walker. When he pushes it, the wheels move too fast and he falls. The toys on the front didn't hold his attention either. He played with it once and then didn't touch it again for a month. I ended up returning it and purchasing a different one. He plays with the front of the new one all the time, although the wheels still have the same problem.
B009M1QRM8|2.0|I have read all the Preston/Childs novels and was disappointed with this one.  After a long story-telling, it just seems to end abruptly, with an &#34;...and then they all lived happily ever after&#34; quality.  Disappointing.
B00993FEUK|5.0|The kids loved the movie. I enjoy the fact that I can keep a copy in the car and a digital copy on the ipods for the kids
B002I0J5FG|3.0|I'm upset because I paid the price for a new game when I got a used one with a messed up case. This is Amazon's fault. The game itself is good though..
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Everything was awsome. The quality of the dvd was perfect. I will buy from this site in the future and recommend to friends and family. This show is the perfect remedy for....anything! Love it
0143118420|5.0|If you REALLY want to know what Ms. Gilbert experienced on her journeys.  From her writing I received a deep insight into what she received on her travels as she opened to the experiences she choose.  The movie is a Hollywood-ized, fluff version of her journeys.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I first listened to these three albums when they were free on The Weeknd's site and I was blown away. All I have to say is that if you love R&B, GET THIS ALBUM! Abel's music is a nice, refreshing feel to the R&B scene and easily better than a lot of the music that is currently being played on the radio.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this game and became addicted to it, but shortly I noticed some flaws with it.<br />1) You need to either be patient or buy a lot of gold and gems. Every now and then you get a gem or two in game and bit/money is easy enough to get, but in order to get some ponies, you need a stupid amount of gems or bits to be able to buy them. Saving up for some of them would take too long.<br />2) Sometimes the graphic get sluggish or slow. It doesn't affect game play per say, but is still annoying.<br />3) Sometime after a game when you get your final score and see how much star you get, the graphics gets weird, kind of gets stuck and you have to exit out yourself.<br />4) THERE ARE ONLY 3 MINI GAMES! The first is an apple catching game, which I actually enjoy. There is a ball bouncing game, which I hate. Sometimes you swipe to hit the ball and the ball doesn't register it. There is also is a flying game, which is okay. You only play this one after completing a star. The other two you have to play in order to complete the stars. The two main games get repetitive as all hell. You need to play them over and over game for every pony you have. You need the stars so they can work at certain places so you can earn bits/money. It's also annoying that the mini games cost bits/money to play.<br />5) The game restarted itself TWICE on me and I had to start all over again. I got to level 26 then the game graphics got really weird so I exited out of the game. After I reopened the game I saw that it reset itself. Everything I did was gone. According to customer services there was nothing to be done. So I started over again. This time I got to level 33 and turned off the game like normal. When I tried to play again I could see that it restarted itself again!<br />Then I immediately removed it from my Kindle. I refuse to start all over again for a 3rd time. I might play again once they debug the game. For now though it's dead to me. I say stay away from this. It's not worth it! IfI could give less then 1 start I would.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I was quite happy with the Palm Pre version of this app.  The Kindle version is perfect.  Great for road trips.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|This required 40MB (or close to) to download to the Kindle.  I didn't think it was very appropriate for my kids ages 5 - 9 so I deleted it.  I didn't check it out very close, but did not think it was very appropriate for my kids.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I highly enjoyed this book. I only wish that the movie was just like it. I was very shocked to come across so many parts of the book, that were either in the movie (but altered) or not in the movie at all. Over all I loved this book. I highly recommended it to any reader.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|This is a fun time killer for airports, plane rides, and sleepless nights.<br />I just wish the graphics had a little more depth
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I rated this a five because it is a really good book . I like everything about this book. I would recommend this book to everyone I know!!!!!!!!!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|We love the Dark Knight series and this box set in blueray was great for us! Each film comes with a disc of special features also. And there's a mini photo book included in the box.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The reason I loved the book \\"The perks of being a wallflower\\" is because it has so much depth and detail to it that it makes you feel like you're living right there in the moment and it deals with lots of different subjects and for that reason relates to many different people.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I can't believe I found this four disc combo set. I love the digital copy that I can put on my mobile devices. I highly recommend it.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Heat Wave, purportedly by Richard Castle, is tied in to the books written by Nathan Fillion's character on the \\"Castle\\" tv show. So we don't really know who wrote it. That said, it wasn't a bad read.<br /><br />Much like most hardboiled police procedurals, the are deaths, thefts, investigation, plenty of cop-type gallows humor, and plenty of heat and steam (it's summertime) between Det. Nikki Heat and ride-along journalist Jameson Root.<br /><br />The scenes and characters are well developed and move at a brisk pace. The dialog is better than in some books I've read lately. The solution was ingenious, but that may be because the perpetrator I picked out turned out to be the guilty party.<br /><br />Anyway, good job go whoever actually wrote the book. If you the reader are a fan of this type of mystery and/or the tv show, you'll probably like it.<br />,
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love the syncing between my kindle, tablet and phone. The document reader is actually superior to that of the kindle.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Great movie.  Enjoy it often.  See something new in it every time. I recommend it.  Stellar performances by all players.
B00AOQ8MOQ|5.0|&#34;I...am...a...Federal...Agent!&#34;<br /><br />Ah, Keanu.<br /><br />Everybody in the movie is gorgeous.  The surfing is fun to watch.  Gary Busey!!!!!!<br /><br />Ignore the ridiculous plot and all the holes therin through which you could pilot a supertanker.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride, brah!
0062213423|5.0|My daughter is a huge fan and loved the book.  The quotes are good, she was happy to read what the guys had to say about their lives.  The photos are great.  The boys tell their life stories, there are a few baby pictures that are very cute.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Reminded me of  a combination of several other books, surprise ending was different. Good book for $3.99 and fun read.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I love this game it is amazing you should get it do not make the mistake of not it is amazing
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I am now addicted to this app! I wasn't sure about buying at first but, it wad worth it! Thanks for the AWESOME app. Keep up the great work. I didn't know it could get better from the first one! AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The movie is great sing along fun.  This was the worst visual transmission I have ever had from Amazon.  I had lots of bars showing good connection but movie was never completely clear.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Ohmygosh!  FF is my all time favorite RPG, and this one works super great on my FIRE HD!  I am just delighted to have found this app.  Now how about FFIV?
1611761182|5.0|I loved picking up from Ken Follett's previous book following the characters through another world war. NI look forward to the next part of the trilogy.
B004OFWLO0|4.0|The sound quality on this collection is much better than anticipated.  For those of you out there who already know who Robert Johnson is, you won't be disappointed.  For new fans, it is quite amazing to think that these tracks were recorded 70+ years ago and they are still relevant today.  There are so many licks in here that we are still copying in rock now!
1619695006|5.0|In this book by Harry Potter's author, I was impressed by how well she understands how people think, especially children.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I picked this book up only because I had to see what the hoopla was about. Yeah, I'm sure I was one of the millions who put Fifty Shades over the tipping point and I'm not proud.<br /><br />The writing was awful. I don't know how many times the author put the words &#34;Damn!&#34; or &#34;Crap!&#34; into the protagonist's mouth. The author is not a wordsmith by any stretch.<br /><br />The formula though, it does reel you in. You want the protagonist to tame Christian. So, kudos to the author for that (and for making tons of money).<br /><br />If the story is at all accurate, I guess you could say it offers a bit of an education into the S&M world without being too seedy. The sex, in the first few chapters, was pretty hot. But after that, it got extremely repetitive and boring. Same ol', same ol'.<br /><br />Some of the references to Seattle were laughable. I don't know anyone who would drive through Pike's Place Market on their way home from the airport, for instance. Unless they happened to live in a condo down there, but it didn't seem as if Christian resided in that neighborhood.<br /><br />The author is clearly not familiar with the location of her story, which always irks me.<br /><br />In summation: Poor writing, hot sex (at first), winning formula (apparently), silly and vague location references.<br /><br />Only buy and read if you really feel you must.
B0087HT36U|5.0|It allows one to focus on math/construction and most importantly patience! ;) I like ok must go chasing. after. three year old
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have read the whole Percy Jackson series and loved it also I have read the Kane trilogy also loved it and just finished the last hero's of Olympus I can't wait till fall of 2013 to read the next AMAZING book by Rick Riordan
B0086700CM|5.0|Purchased this for my 3 year old granddaughter  She taught me how to play<br /><br />She loves it , keeps her busy for hours
B0095R6OBS|3.0|I bought this movie because it had the star of &#34;The Never-ending Story&#34; in it.  I was disappointed at how short the movie was.  Also  the story was really predictable and unbelievable.  By unbelievable I mean how everyone got freaked out by a dog running through their neighborhood and predictable I mean by how it followed the classic Frankenstein story line; but done in a very fast style.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Some originality<br />Stars Barret Oliver<br />Price really cheap to buy<br /><br />Cons:<br />Predictable and Unbelievable story-line<br />Movie too short
0205313426|5.0|I started my doctorate degree through GCU (Grand Canyon University) this past summer (2012).  I was terrified of having to write again after six years of being out of school.  This book is the best!  As long as you learn what style (APA/ MLA) your university requires then, you are set.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great story I just loved it.  When is the 3rd book coming out about Gideon and Eva?  I hope it's soon.
B00APUQT7I|1.0|The first one was entertaining. The second was passable entertainment.  The third one was just too many.  The fourth one was a foregone conclusion.  My daughter liked it, for some reason, and her taste in movies is not usually questionable but in this case, I'm not sure what she was thinking. Maybe she was sleepy and wasn't really watching.  If she was, she probably would have hated it like I did.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Rarely a novel comes along that tells a story that whilst bleak and tragic, takes the reader on a trip which encapsulates beauty, resourcefulness, raw humanity and finding a place to exist in a world that is fast falling apart. Never before has death been handled in such a gentle way that beauty and tragedy forge a relationship to deliver the reader vivid imagery and perfect narrative.<br /><br />Essentially The Book Thief does not follow standard narrative timing, the narrator will give a glimpse of the future to present a context to the past. This style is key to creating multi layers of detail which soften the harrowing blows as they eventually fall thick and fast. Unusually and effectively this sees the story move towards the ending we were presented at the very beginning of the novel. However don't think it is all bleak, the relationships forged in heartbreak, friendships cemented through shared adventure and the simple bonds of good people doing what they believe is right in the face of adversity creates enough warmth to sustain the reader.  Where Zusak presents grim imagery he will often oppose this with breathtaking moments of simple humanity, encapsulating a palate of colour that spreads itself thickly over a decidedly grey time of recent history.<br /><br />In essence whilst others will tell you The Book Thief is about death or war or a love of words, the most important theme of the book is humanity. Stepping forward when others do not, accepting your fate and dealing with it the best way you know how, finding beauty in simplicity, seeking out colour when nothing remains.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|What happened, Oliver Stone?  This movie was painful to watch, my friend and I stopped and started it three times, ultimately I opted to take the $4 loss rather than suffer through the rest.
B00846REIS|5.0|although this book had similarities to 50 Shades of Grey, i found it more thought out & better written. this plot has more depth & i felt more connected to Eva's character. definitely reading the rest of the series. an outstanding read, recommend to everyone who's a 50 Shades fan!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I am sure I will never delete this game. I can not quit playing it!  What's even better is that it was free!  I just wish I could get it to update! But that is fine! I love this game!
0143038095|4.0|The Joy Luck Club was such an intricate novel. Its recurring themes of fighting one's heritage and family love truly touched me. I also enjoyed Amy Tan's diction, throwing in Chinese words that cannot be truly translated into English. Translation apparently loses some effect.<br />The theme of fighting one's heritage truly intrigued me, as I have never deeply looked into my own. I felt a great kinship toward Jing-Mei Woo, who felt she could not do her mother's memory justice when talking to her half-sisters in China. Jing-Mei, in her younger years, felt as though her mother expected too much of her. Her mother wanted her to be a piano prodigy. Jing-Mei resented this expectation, so sought to purposely thwart her mother's hope. She eventually gave up piano, but only after shaming her mother. Initially, she felt relief. However, in later years, Jing-Mei looked back with regret that she never truly tried. She always sought to show her mother how unimpressive her daughter was. She did not finish college, she never truly settled anywhere. It is only after her mother dies, and Jing-Mei is put in her place at the Joy Luck Club that she truly begins to understand her mother. Jing-Mei hears of her mother's tragic life before coming to America, and in the end must go pass on the memory of her mother to two sisters Jing-Mei never knew she had. And only by looking past the Americanized life she leads can she see what it means to be Chinese.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|all in all a good read. not something I would read if I wanted a cheery book. I thought a couple of the caricatures were a little unrealistic, but it was well written for the most part. I found myself thinking about the book  for several weeks after I finished reading it.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|As a fan of Family Guy, I thought from the previews for Ted that it would really enjoy the movie.  My wife and I tried to see it in the theater thinking we were out of luck because it was sold out.  I wasn't expecting amazing cinematography or a touching story, just hilarity, but when we finally had time to watch the movie and rented it from Amazon it just seemed tired and was a struggle to watch all the way through.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|A great read. Kept me guessing until the last minute. Will definately read more of Kate Mortons books. Well written, I couldn't put it down.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a great movie for young and old to enjoy together. It is a great moral story! My niece loves this movie!
B004FPZ2KY|5.0|Brilliant writing.  What a use of the English language.  So rich and complex.  It takes a while to get into her writing style<br />which is so sophisticated and witty.<br />Besides her use of the language which makes &#34;american English&#34; so much more pitiful, it is incredible how she weaves<br />a fascinating tale, page after page, on the basis of a very simple story:  i.e. boy meets girl.<br />One is constantly in suspense and the level of eroticism is so high without even a hint of touch between the two<br />protagonists for more than half the book.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I purchased this game for my granddaughter and she loves it. I love it too, because it helps her to solve the problem in feeding the little guy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A surprising &#34;who done it&#34; revelation since the reader cannot claim any &#34;suspect&#34; for a long time.<br />Then the book takes an awkward twist, less interesting and a bit boring in the middle.  I don't want to reveal too much<br />for those who didn't read the book but the end also, is less than satisfying.  However for quite a while, it makes<br />interesting reading.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game!!! I play it with my friends all the time. I play it nonstop. I love that the log in with facebook is easy you should totally get it!!! best game ever!!!
B008JEJPSC|5.0|This was a new DVD, still in the wrapper, and exactly as described by the seller.  Our children saw the film when it first came out, and I was hoping that we could get a copy for the grandchildren to enjoy.  So many video stores are now closing in our area, so it was nice to be able to have a copy through Amazon.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I loved this book, and I agree completely that the secret to life is, in fact, kale. I've always loved Ellen and in this book I realized that I'm not crazy because my thoughts on a daily basis can be summed up by this book. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to smile and laugh. You really feel like you're having a conversation with her throughout the book.
B007RTAR64|3.0|I found something ordinary. Arrived on time and in excellent conditions. I expected something a little different perhaps more accessories. Regards

0812992784|4.0|Having not read \\"The Satanic Verses\\" or any novel by Mr. Rushdie for some reason I was interested to read his memoir. Having done so I am sure his novels would not be of any interest to me since they all appear to be fantasy-based, but as for this book \\"Joseph Anton\\" I can only say that it is eloquently written, with attention to minor detail for which I am grateful because I simply could not get enough, it even showed sparks of humour, indeed a pleasant surprise under such alarming circumstances - a tribute to the man who lived it.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the first 140 pages & almost gave up the reading; gladly I did not because the rest of the book is simply gripping. At first I was confused by the third person narrative until I realized the reason for it. `Joseph Anton' is the name Mr. Rushdie took when the fatwa came about & in writing this book which is a memoir of that period he is referring to Joseph Anton as `he' & `him' - he is not Joseph Anton, he is Salman Rushdie & Salman Rushdie is writing this book. I get it.<br /><br />The so-called `name-dropping' is stupidly exaggerated. Since these are people who played a vital role in Mr. Rushdie's life during this period why would he not mention their names? For those who stood by him, offered friendship & help, perhaps this is his way of acknowledging them & stating his gratitude. What should he have done? Say: \\"Mr. X offered me a place to stay\\", \\"John Doe came to my defense\\", \\"Jane Doe showed me solidarity\\", I mean, really?? For those who did not, well, it would have been remiss not to mention them.<br /><br />Since I have never had to live under such conditions I would not dare to criticize one who did. If he made some bad decisions & choices during this time it is surely allowed. I would have caved after 2 weeks! For him to have come out after 10 years of this kind of prison & still have his wits about him, to be sane & able to write about it is nothing short of a miracle.<br /><br />Chapter X (At the Halcyon Hotel) is so thoughtful, insightful & right-on when it comes to people's perceptions I had to read it twice. It is so impressive & immediately urgent to note that indeed Literature does live long after its authors - such as Ovid's poetry outlasting the Roman Empire & so on. Beautifully put:<br />\\"Art was strong, artists less so\\" Salman Rushdie/'Joseph Anton'. Page 628.<br /><br />If you have the least interest in `freedom of speech'; if you are interested in knowing the courage of a man with a price on his head; you will not want to miss reading this book. You will also learn a thing or two about the politics of the publishing business.<br /><br />Neil Armstrong stepping onto the moon may have taken \\"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" Mr. Rushdie has done the same thing for freedom of speech & expression.the Halcyon Hotel) is so thoughtful, insightful & right-on when it comes to people's perceptions I had to read it twice. It is so impressive & immediately urgent to note that indeed Literature does live long after its authors - such as Ovid's poetry outlasting the Roman Empire & so on. Beautifully put:<br />\\"Art was strong, artists less so\\" Salman Rushdie/'Joseph Anton'. Page 628.<br /><br />If you have the least interest in `freedom of speech'; if you are interested in knowing the courage of a man with a price on his head; you will not want to miss reading this book. You will also learn a thing or two about the politics of the publishing business.<br /><br />Neil Armstrong stepping onto the moon may have taken \\"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" Mr. Rushdie has done the same thing for freedom of speech & expression.
B0033PQUXA|5.0|One of my favorite films, so I gifted it to my daughter-in-law who laughted and cried and laughted!  It&#34;s now one of her favorite films!
B005VPRET4|5.0|This toy was ideal for my Grand Daughter. She has had much fun role playing with the characters and has proven to help with her motor skills.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Awesome game! too he will best game ever, plus fun and time wise, use all the time. I need more levels.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like playing this game, it is fun and sometimes take a little thinking to clear a level. I don't like it when I take more than 3 times to clear a level.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|I choose this rating because of the action. This movie also has a lot of famous very good actors in it as well. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes action movies.
1608871088|5.0|I was lucky to think ahead and purchase this art book before the film was released. I'm really glad I did, because the visuals are amazing! The bits of backstory on the characters and their environments make for a fascinating read. Being able to see the artwork of the artists who worked so hard to put this film together is a real treat, and an inspiration for any aspiring artist.<br /><br />A great purchase, and a must-have for the library of any RoTG fan.
B000UYJR7I|4.0|The movie has a lot of twist and turns. The actors and actresses did a great job on their roles.Good movie for those that like bizarre kind of movies
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Typical fan response: review wasn't even up 3 minutes before it was hit.  Why can't fans understand that not all reviewers will give their favorite authors 5 stars and that just maybe others would like to hear a different point of view?  AND that the helpful review button is for those without a vested interest.<br /><br />I have to say, I was kind of disappointed in this story because it was just too unbelievable, sticky sweet and wrapped up WAY too nicely which is ironic coming from an author who calls herself a \\"hardcore realist\\".  I suppose if I had read this story before Slammed and Point of Retreat I would be more lenient, but Hoover's stories are now just too \\"perfect\\" with very little realism.<br /><br />I didn't hate this story; in fact I loved parts of it like when Holder told Skye that he \\"live her\\" - a combination of \\"like\\" working towards, but not yet, \\"love\\" - that was imaginative and beautiful.  I also liked how the story unfolded by being mysterious one minute and romantic the next.  I loved Karen and Skye's relationship with their \\"I'm not getting pregnant, Mom. Only terribly high and cracked out.\\" She laughs and hugs me. \\"Good girl. And wasted. Don't forget to get wasted\\", and the trust they had in each other.  But the poetic and imaginative writing that captured my attention in Hoover's previous works was corrupted by the unrealistic PERFECTNESS<br /><br />What I didn't like was how PERFECT Holder was, I mean, come on, he was 18 or 19 years old and he said and did everything as if he had a PhD in psychology.  It was UNBELIEVABLE and made me roll my eyes and groan to read one more sentence of his god-like answers of comfort.  It immediately lost its grittiness for me and the drama became just that - drama.  Then the inter-lapping of lives and circumstances all wrapped up so neatly that no one appeared to even need therapy just seemed implausible and sappy.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't want a sad ending, just a believable one!<br /><br />I hate thatI feel this way about a book that so many have obviously LOVED, but after rolling my eyes for the eightieth time, it was hopeless (literally).  This story was going to be a chore to finish; and it was.  It took me four days, but I did it.<br /><br />Indie authors are writing the life out of abuse, suicide and bullying and giving their victims' PERFECT saviors (which they claim they can because it is FICTION).  Well, FICTION does require some realism to make it believable and enjoyable or at the very least relatable.  Maybe a savior does come along, but he is NEVER perfect and THAT is what makes him human.<br /><br />Would I/Did I buy it? Yes (3.99)<br />Would I read it again? No<br />Would I recommend it to friends? Sure, obviously I am in the minority
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|i thought it was okay because the volume goes up to loud and my sister hates my brother yells at me,.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|fast and easy to learn. great way to waste time I have tried a couple of itree games and have really enjoyed them
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Sometimes I get a little tired of being preached to overtly.  Felt like she was trying to reinforce the theme of the trilogy and tie up loose ends. Kind of disappointing.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|I just received only one chapter instead of the book. I was billed for the entire book This will stop me from ordering again.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|So much better than the movie!! I love it!!! There's no place like home!<br />So glad I got this book! I love the little munchkins!!
0800141660|3.0|The acting is great except a crying scene near the end. It wasn't \\"sobbing,\\" it was some kind of giggling/jerking fit that made me burst into laughter.<br />Wardrobe & setting were very accurate for the time period.<br /><br />My problem is with the story itself. When you sit through a movie as long as this one you expect some resolution. I don't know why Hugh Grant is on the cover since he's barely in it.<br /><br />The movie was boring. Even for a love story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a great book! Builds from beginning to end. Lots of twists. Glad I had the last book ready to go when I finished,
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|loved the characters, the voices, the timing, the story-line, the effects - THE HORSE!  Would recommend to anyone 7 or 8 years and older.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|And that was the only reason to watch it because various people told me that it was  not a good movie.  And yes, it was a mediocre movie.  Unnecessary long, with the plot doing a few deeps towards boredom, and reaching a conclusion that was really bad.<br />In general, it has the Batman quality, but there are James-Bond-like scenes that make it out of touch with the series. Also, there is too much soul searching etc at the expense of action. And let's not talk about the bravado / patriotic scenes.<br />I was disappointed and of course suffered from my wife's nagging at the end (\\"You make me watch boring movies instead of watching Ice Age 4\\")!<br />But if you are a fun of the series you will find some good things, for example new toys, and all in all it is a an OK conclusion to the trilogy, and I guess the start<br />of the Robin series
B008J34466|4.0|With The Truth About Love, P!nk delivers one of her best albums; tied only with Funhouse. The CD is well-rounded, with many upbeat, relatable, fun, danceable songs. Some of these are Blow Me (One Last Kiss,) How Come You're Not Here, and Where Did the Beat Go. There are also several slower songs; Try, Just Give Me A Reason, and Beam Me Up.<br /><br />Also, P!nk swears. A lot. I was not surprised, because I have heard her music before. Also, the CD SAYS \\"Explicit Lyrics\\" on it. Not rocket science, people. But be warned- this collection is not for family car trips.<br /><br />The Truth About Love also has some of my favorite songs P!nk has ever released. I love Just Give Me A Reason, How Come You're Not Here, and Try.\<br /><br />Four stars only because there were two songs I didn't care for; one of them is Are We All We Are.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is the same one I used on the ipad and I liked it there. The commercials are a bit bothersome.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose this book because I never read it before. This book  is the best.  I like it. Thanks it
B007SGM084|5.0|I read the trilogy in less than a week. Great read! Do not just read the first book & judge the whole series based on that alone. It's a building block for the next two books!!!
B000FBFN0Q|3.0|Enjoyed reading this book.  This girl went through so much to learn from her mistakes. I bet this happens in real life.
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|I'm a Sharon Stone fan and this was one of her best.  I enjoyed the acting as well as the sex.  sharon Stone is hot.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game helps me to stay focus. Being repetitive also helps concentration. recommend to people with ADHD who need the focus skills to manage concentration.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easier to win than other games. I can recommend. I really like the end display when I win. I love my Kindle.
B000001DVD|5.0|This is real raw rock and roll!  High 'n Dry by far my favorite Def Leppard CD. It has little known gems like Lady Strange, Mirror Mirror, the title track and of course Bringin' on the Heartbreak.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was one of the best books I have ever read! It touches me in a way nothing has ever touched me before it is the kind of book that means something and that's very rare for a book.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|i enjoy this app immensly. have found it easy, and fun...positioning kindle takes practice for certain shots, but all in all I would highly recommend.
B006C1DH92|4.0|nice twist on the original . really enjoy the variety of challenges! def recommend . just wish there was more bonus content .
B008TRUDAS|5.0|First of all this book gave be butterflies. Seriously, it took me back to when I was young like Layken and boys were cute and everything they did made me sigh. Will is BEYOND awesome. He was the Hero all the way even when you hated him. He was every girls dream, shoot he's my dream too. I LOVED this book so much I was calling my husband Will for a few weeks after I read it. ;)<br /><br />The book taught be a lot of things, SLAMMED poetry being one of they and my new love for The Avett Brothers being the second. How cool is that. I loved reading the end of each chapter because I lived for those lyrics. I had never heard of the Avett Brother before this book. I was hooked with the lyrics and the fact that Will and Lake were able to bond over them was my turning point. I also wanted to be in on the greatness. So not only did a get an UH-mazing story with Will and Lake I also got the beauty of Slam poetry and of The Avett Brother.<br /><br />Even though I sing, \\"I Would Be Sad\\" all the time, I am not. Not especially after reading this book.  ;)
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This was a new DVD in excellent conditions. I did not expect anything less than a &#34;5&#34; star rating for this product.
B004UJCYYW|5.0|What more can one say about one of the greatest works of literature of all times? In Tome I (Fantine), we get to know her and most of the main characters in a way that only Victor Hugo can present. Reading is fairly easy in the original French save for some XIX century expressions that are not used much today. But this adds to the sense of ambiance in the novel. There is no film or stage work that could ever compare to the original for its rawness and power.<br /><br />Now on to Tome II Cossette (Fantine's daughter).
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I'll just start out by saying I'm not necessarily a Batman fanatic. I love a good super hero. I love a good action movie. I like Christian Bale; Love Anne Hathaway; Love Gary Oldman; Love Michael Caine. Heck, I'm a HUGE Pittsburgh Steelers fan and actually bought the commemorative Hines Ward action figure before even seeing this movie  There's a lot to like about The Dark Knight Rises. But, it just didn't do it for me. I was disappointed in Bale's performance this time around. Anne Hathaway couldn't have been any sexier. I liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  But, this film just couldn't bring out the super hero fan in me. I thought the script was really bad. Tom Hardy's Bane was annoying. Half the time, we couldn't make out what he was saying. The action was lame. I don't know....for all the hype and how popular this film was, I'm very disappointed.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|Hooked it up.....turned equipment on......everything worked......no decrease in video quality.<br />How could I not like it? I would recommend it.
1401322786|5.0|What I like about this book-<br /><br />  The storyline is unique and it makes for a wonderful book! I've always heard the term \\"father time\\" but never gave much thought to the life of the person behind that name. I don't want to spoil any of the book that is not in the synopsis so, all i'll say is I really loved the brilliant spin on such a classic legend.<br />  The characters are so in-depth and so relatable! The  book is split up into two 3 stories. One about a teenage girl being bullied, a wealthy old man who wants to live forever and a man obsessed with time. I think no matter what stage you're at in life you can relate to one of these characters. I could strongly relate to the girl being bullied; I could feel what she felt. I could even feel what the old man felt. There are no 2 dimensional characters here.<br />  This book had me on an emotional roller coaster. There are no wasted words in this books. Although the majority of the books gives you a dreadful feeling; I love books that make me feel crazy emotions. There were some scenes that really made me  choke up and that doesn't happen often!<br />  I could not turn the pages fast enough. There is so much tension in this book that you'll be dying to know what will happen next. I read this book in just two sittings!<br /><br />What I didn't like in this book:<br /><br />  There is not much about this book I didn't like. In the beginning I felt like the stories interchanged around each other too quickly and it made it hard for me get into. After a few chapters, the brilliant interweaving of the 3 stories made a lot of sense and you'll be glad if you lend it your patients.<br /><br />Overall:  I loved this books so, so, so, much! If you want a break from YA, paranormal, etc. please read this book. Mitch Albom never disappointing and he will blow your mine with this one. I don't think I will ever look at time the same way.<br /><br />Pg-13: Thematic Material<br /><br />Rating: 5/5 Stars<br />Janiera @ Books & Beauty
B009O2XY12|5.0|This is for the little babies bubbles make them laugh so if they like it I like it and that's what counts
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughter loved this movie.  She loves everything Tinkerbell, so this was right up her alley.  I enjoyed it too, and it's fun to see how they continue to develop the story of Tinkerbell.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Once you get &quot;the hang of it&quot; -- you can't stop playing.  If you like a good challenge, give Spider Solitaire a try!
B004U8VWLE|1.0|I did not get to see this movie before my time had ran out.  I thought that I had bought it-but guess not.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Especially love the ability to make the close captioning larger.<br />Very easy to access...I give it 5 stars.<br />Recommend to lovers of sci-fi.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|Great acting and an interesting plot made this movie very entertaining.  The viewer was often caught up in a future vision without realizing it, but when brought back to reality, it became clear that whatever had been seen as the future could be altered.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a movie that keeps one guessing.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent book.  Harry Bosch always makes a story interesting.  los .isnt even my favorite setting, but I seem to be able to adjust
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Good action suspense movie to watch. Kinda short episode cuz I'm not satisfied, wanted more from the movie. But very good to watch from the HD tv at home.
B0068FZ0PG|3.0|It was a decent movie - worth watching - but I am not surprised it didn't run away with a bunch of rewards.  It's kind of far fetched.  I guess the only reason I bought it was because I live in Iowa and visited the Field of Dreams site while van camping.
B000AO4NJA|5.0|does the job as expected. works well. i like it. came on time. good price. i was happy with my purchase.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|enough levels and reasonably challenging . some people might find white Dragon level 38 offensive- I simply skipped it. could have more features, like different modes of play and bonus levels.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|5 Star» Great Effort!<br /><br />Me Being a Kid my self, just goes to show I love your series.<br />The First time I read 1 of your books, I nearly choked of laughter. I have your ENTIRE series- my favorite being cabin fever, AND The Third Wheel. Great Work! I Can't Wait to see what you come up with next.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|Amazing!!!! Thank you Justin for all that you do. I love you so much word can't even describe. You're such an amazing person! :)
B005FISBTO|4.0|If you buy this, do not watch it until you have time to watch the whole thing. It is awesome. It is a little irritating that you cannot fast forward through the Showtime ads and previews in between episodes. If it were not for that I would have given 5 stars.
B00770KR7W|5.0|my son is into halo 4 and just loved this action figure for his collection. he never puts it down, just becareful how your child plays with it, the wrists of the toy can break easily.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|It was a great buy especially for me and it's great for any avenged sevenfold fan! It is definitely with the buy!
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|Billy Friedkin must have been trying to emulate the Coens or Tarantino when he decided to make this one. But if so, it's a poor imitation; no one can handle black comedy like the Coens. There is no subtlety or wit in this film, but I have to admit that there is a bit of humor, if you don't mind being hit over the head with it like a sledgehammer. There are people this stupid out there, I guess. You do hear about husbands and wives being killed for the insurance money, over pathetically tiny policies like $25K or $50K. So in a sense one could say that the subject matter for this film has been 'ripped from the headlines'. But who cares? Everything has been dumbed down to the point that even a person with the IQ of Haden-Churches' stupifyingly moronic Ansel--I'm guessing 75?--would be able to follow this plotline.<br />And it seems all so patently false to me, particularly the actors and the roles they are playing. Gina Gershon is a spectacularly beautiful 'older' woman, whose perfect body is obviously the result of countless hours of gym sculpting and careful dieting, perhaps even surgical enhancements, hardly the type of woman who'd live in a trailer park, work in a pizza joint, and be married to a cretin like Ansel. Haden-Church is a big, handsome, he-man type of guy, and I found it hard to believe he could be so idiotic and so ineffectual. Then we have McConaghey. I didn't buy him as the big, bad, killer rogue detective. Like Tom Cruise, he is a very slight, small man--I'm betting he had to stand on a box to tower over Emile Hirsch--and I can't understand his appeal to women. There are very few scenes of just he and Haden-Church together, because Haden-Church is probably twice his size. It would have been better to have Haden-Church play his part. To me, MM just seems like a poser, a little guy acting tough, like Stallone or Cruise. His black get-up of cowboy hat, shades, leather jacket, pants and boots was laughable, not menacing. These people are all too good-looking to be credible in their roles.<br />But if you assume that the entire movie is just a caricature of redneck behavior, then you might be entertained. But this is the opposite of enlightening or creative. I didn't find it funny, as so many others have done, because it is so witless. Not one of Friedkin's better movies.king to be credible in their roles.<br />But if you assume that the entire movie is just a caricature of redneck behavior, then you might be entertained.

B000FC12YQ|2.0|Book reviews and movie reviews are much the same.  Two people can read the same book and have totally opposite opinions.<br />If one person loved it and the other hated it, is the book good or bad?  Neither.  Having said that, I found this not to be one of Agatha's best.  No exotic locale, just a stodgy English village.  The book itself seemed stodgy and pedantic, not a page-turner, by any means.  And the ending......what a disappointment!  Frustrating.  No fair.......
1594487154|5.0|Educators are salespeople.  Yup, you heard me right.<br /><br />In Daniel Pink's new book, To Sell Is Human, he argues that while 1 in 9 people today are in sales, so are the other 8: \\"Whether we're employees pitching colleagues on a new idea, entrepreneurs enticing funders to invest, or parents and teachers cajoling children to study, we spend our days trying to move others.  LIke it or not, we're all in sales now.\\"<br /><br />This book holds its own in the impressive wake of his previous books, A Whole New Mind and Drive.  Pink manages to seamlessly curate tons of research-based information into a fluent dialogue that is smart, readable, and witty.<br /><br />While his books do not address education directly, they all speak to education in the larger sense.  His framework within To Sell Is Human is not only applicable to teachers, but to our students as well.  It emphasizes skill sets that are necessary to the success of our students in the future.<br /><br />If you're an innovative educator, don't miss out on this book.
B0051XQI84|5.0|I never saw the movie when it came out in theaters, but just recently a friend recommended that I watch it, and, let me tell you, I'm sure glad I did! It was hilarious and uplifting and had hints of biblical truth all throughout
B000O19EWK|5.0|This was a good film to just sit back enjoy!  Yes, it is a comic book character, but Tobey Maguire was really good in this. I will watch the sequels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the first series that I had felt myself become part of the story. I love this book. It is one to read over and over again
B007MDB548|4.0|very predictable but daughter liked it.  computer generated amination was of normal quality. Have the digital copy for ipad use
B000002UV9|5.0|I love this band and so do the theives that keep swipping it from me.  It's nice to find copies affordable and fast.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|This was a gift.  My niece seemed to like it a lot and said she has listened to it a lot
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great kids movie, and the humor works for adults too. Our whole family loves it. Nothing offensive for little kids. Funny movie.
B002EPWTLC|5.0|Andre's music is always joyous and beautiful with his talented orchestra.  He needs to be watched as well as listened to.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very engaging! Lots of unexpected twists!  The romance was  the only predictable aspect of the novel, to me. Overall, great read.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Definitely has a throwback sound on a few of the tracks, which I love! A sexy voice and some steamy lyrics...what's not to like?! Fun to listen to on my long commute home! I'd say it's worth the money.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is the wifes read - once into it she could not put it down. We had a friend who recently passed on and she had read it and my wife found it to be compeling and was helpful before and after our friend had passed.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|This app almost have all your art needs. It's like the art programs on a computer but perfectly fit on a mobile device. It have many types of brushes and colors that can be edit, three types of canvas sizes, and different preference settings such as interface editing and offset painting.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good art app for you kindle or other android devices, this app is for you!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I love this show. It is probably the most complete program on tv (to me) HBO is tops when it comes to hard-hitting, dramatic programming. Completely recommend this product for everyone.
B002UEW31I|5.0|Great movie! A real fun ride. Tarantino captures your attention from the beginning and you are on the edge of your seat till the end.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I get so distracted when I finally get to read that this has been put on back burner. Hope to get thru it soon.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|We have been looking for a charging cord that will not be gone in a week with useing it every day with the kindle fire. 3 weeks and still going strong love it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Old Harry strikes again. I have followed Harry from the first Michael Connelly book. This was a good one. It dragged a bit with all the police proceedures but one finds out there is a reason for this. Can't wait for the next
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It works very well. It does more than I expected. It has a good media player attached.It has a clear intuitive user interface.
B00973DDN2|5.0|The killers have once again shown their talent and growth in their new their new album &#34;battle born&#34;. The album itself sets off a new feeling and tune to the band showing their growth compared to past great songs before. My most played &#34;Here with me&#34;. Vocalist Brandon Flowers once again proves great dynamic and talent. A very good, unique album.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Couldn't put it down unroll I finished it, now on to the next one.  I hope it is also good.
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|Christmasville: The Missing Santa Adventures was a cute game. Light and entertaining. I enjoyed the characters and storyline. I have a Kindle Fire and it played without any problems. Great for a little light entertainment.
B00913DPW2|5.0|full of brain twisters as I go from room to room..<br />Very Challenging<br /><br />I have not finished yet . maybe there is no ending???????  BOO
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I'd have rated it higher but they left one of the best songs from the show off the album.  How can you have a Les Miserables CD without Do You Hear The People Sing?  I was disappointed with that, but overall a good CD.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album is outstanding. That's all there is too it. I really like Macklemore's support for same sex marriage in the song \\"Same Love\\". Macklemore can be funny like in \\"Thrift Shop\\" and serious like in \\"Wing$\\" or \\"Same Love.\\" Buy this album!!!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I have not read the book, but I love period movies. This mini series is very beautiful. I cannot believe I had it for over a year before I watched it. Highly recommend!! Cheers!!
0345803485|5.0|It is a great read, and a really easy read also. I thought that it was really good. Definitely not appropiate for young kids or even young teens.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I didn't like how they spoke. No one says shall I.  It would have been more enjoyable had they spoke normal.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT BOOK, I HOPE HE DOESN'T GET LAZY LIKE SOME WRITERS AND (FARM OUT)<br />THE BOOK WORK.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|My husband loved this movie I found it to be okay, just about everyone I asked they thouth it to be ok too.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Very easy to use.  Only complaint is that it is smarter than me!  Lucky it's able to adjust the degree of difficulty.
B004R63MWQ|3.0|I gave it three star because(even though I love technology) some of our people won't understand what went into it.
B00APUQJLO|3.0|I enjoyed the tone and dialogue of this film.  The dialogue was very cerebral, phonemically written, and extremely well executed by the actors. Robert Pattinson delivers a great performance and has great chemistry in the exchanges that he has with the supporting actors. The biggest flaw I found with the film is that its plot is totally lost in the dialogue and the performance by the actors which leaves the viewer with very little to connect with in the end.
B0012Q732O|4.0|Even though I'm a tech freak, I still love prehistoric era movies that have a good story line. I would certainly recommend it.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Loved,it. I could not put it down it was so intriguing. So well written that even while reading I was &#34;wondering&#34; I loved the interaction with the animals and the explanation of animals living in a Zoo. According to Martel we all live in a &#34;zoo&#34;. How true. I highly recommend this book. I will be reading this again soon.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I have always been a sucker for all of the Mission: Impossible shows. And, believe it or not, some of the gadgetry used in some of those shows, even the ones with Tom Cruise, has been useful.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I love this game. however I downloaded this app. because it said FREE and because I like these type of game. I was happy to find a game that was enjoyable to play. Until it came to the part that said pay 2.99 to unlock the rest of this game. 2.99 does NOT mean free. After I write and post my view I will be deleting this game from my kindle. and for as much as Ligament I will be warning my friends and any one who will listen that to this company FREE DOES NOT MEAN FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!! it means try a sample and then pay us!!!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Great app to use on the go to edit your word documents or power points. Has a simple interface, so you can only do simple things on this app but it does do its job. I would recommend this app if you usually need to do simple things in docs, and are usually on the move.
0879800925|5.0|Essential and perfect for building a dream. Life today would not be the same for me if the words in this book were never put to paper.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Fun app. I would recommend this app to a friend who likes to think, and likes games where you have to think about how your going to make it to your objective using the least amount of supplies as possible.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I found this book to be what other books were not. It changed, completely, how I feel about building wealth and teaching others to do the same. By changing your mindset, you change your life.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Nice app. Does not have all of the radio stations here at the bay area. It is missing a few radio stations that I really like. I would recommend this app since it does provide a few good radio stations.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game vet I could play it for hours and hours my favorite is creative mode I love it soooooo much
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book is amazing I get started reading and have a hard time putting it down. This is the second time I have read the series and I will read it again.
B009O2XY12|4.0|It helps me clear my mind and relax.  Since it's the free version, it is a win, win!  I have it on my Kindle Fire and Iphone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book kept my attention the whole time, my imagination was going crazy. This is a book I will 're-read again! CAN'T WAIT TO START READING THE NEXT BOOK!
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|In short, this was a bit of a disappointment. Lots of cameos from former characters, but not much new ground covered. It really seemed like not much happened in this movie. The opening and ending scenes (end of the world, over-whelming odds sort of stuff) were the best parts of the movie. The rest was more or less a repeat of the very first movie; people trying to escape and underground facility.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept my attention  the whole way to the end and I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the next book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really do not want it end but it has :-( this was an amazing book I loved all three of them! I really would like to see what else will happen with the Grey's !
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was an amazing book!!!!!! I would totally read it a second Tim  if I had the chance!!!!! Can't wait to see the movie now!!!
B007QUUJMG|4.0|I found this book to be happy, sad, mad and bad all at the same time. I honestly recalled things from my high school days and the relationships I had with friends and my family. I am glad to have read this book and think it was made more interesting to be written as letters/journal entries. A very good read.
B008MEM24S|4.0|its very awzome I like it so much it remiinds me of hotdogs because hotdogs a assonance like taco selleing people
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I chose this rating because it's not the best diary of a wimpy kid book, but I still like it.<br />I like this book simply just because.<br />I recommend this book to every one who likes the diary of a wimpy kid series
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Had heard about the series from friends, but didn't want to start watching mid-stream.  Bought the first two seasons and am now ready for the first episode of Season 3 this weekend!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is great I wasn't sure at first but I was hooked on the romance and all the action
B005LAIHY0|5.0|The transfer is amazing! Everything looks stunning on blu!<br />Enough extras to help &#34;explain&#34; the &#34;plot holes&#34;.<br />The film itself, of course, is a masterpiece. I wasn't completely convinced in the theatre, but after a few views at home I am absolutely sure. The character of David is perfection on film. The story is slightly campy and you must accept this to really enjoy the film.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this series, this last book left me wanting more!!! By the end of the book, I was in tears, because incessant ready to say goodbye!! Can't wait for the movies, they have to fill a high expectation, to top the books!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This scrumptiously painful, tearfully wonderful novel affirms again and again that it is no product of the contemporary cookie cutter. Kudos to Ms. Hoover for her fantastic tale. I am happy and emotionally wrung out now-I may need a chapter break!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is an amazing book. I LOVE it. When will the next installment be out? WHEN? I LOVED it and the last one to. Rick Riordan is the best author ever!!!!!!!!!!! Kudos to you
1562827693|5.0|This is a great book. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the topic. I would read part 1 and part 3 first then move to part 2.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I hate this book<br />Edita and myself a lot more information about the new year with an eye for  the first time in my family tree and myself to be able to get a good idea
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Not the ending that one would expect.  A little disconcerting to follow the first story with an underlying second story running thru the chapters.  Good escapist reading material.
B0057R5XRG|1.0|Does not Come with Ultraviolet code  point less unless u like hard copies but also the movies are awesome !!!
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Don't stop with season One! This show is terrific. Pretty violent so be aware but the different plots are great and the characters are perfect. I'm not a biker but the show is awesome! Get this and all seasons... you won't regret it!
B00APUQT7I|3.0|The connection with Amazon was good and the quality of the video stream is excellent.  My son loved the movie so much he asked to buy it.
0385344333|5.0|I have read every Reacher novel there is. I love this charactor Lee Child has created. Careful... if you read one of these you'll have to read them all. Buy it!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is a very addicting app to play.  Other than the cheats that the global 1st placers use, this game is soooooo awesome. There are fruits that you Candice all over the place and master the art of fruitjizu.
B00867GK26|5.0|Say I'm behind the times but this movie was the first one I watched on Blu-ray. I was stunned at the quality and clarity of the picture! Pixar always does a phenomenal job on their movies and &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; is no exception. I love this movie because not only is there a great moral to the story but it is very family friendly. My two year old daughter loves this movie and asks to watch it all the time. And I really never get tired of watching it because the humor works for adults as well as kids. If you haven't seen this movie, you should buy it. Trust me, it will be worth the money.
B009CPGZFS|5.0|simon baker is fantastic.  even if the rest of the episode is not the greatest (which is rare).  you will be entertained by him.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Really really enjoyed this movie. This movie really captured both the look and feel of earlier days in London.  As a Holmes fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this story
B005LAII8A|4.0|Time travel and telekinesis make an intriguing blend in Rian Anderson's sci-fi thriller LOOPER.  An innovative and complex plot unfolds in a violent and almost surreal landscape.  Without repeating the details of the plot, suffice to say you need to play strict attention to absorb the twists and turns.<br />Joseph-Gordon Levitt is barely recognizable with his prosthetics designed to make him into a younger Bruce Willis.  Levitt is very good in assimilating Willis' mannerisms and persona.  Willis, the senior citizen's resident action hero, acquits himself well, although there's no real surprises with his performance.  Emily Blunt displays her versatility once again in a scene-stealing performance.  Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano and Garrett Dillahunt round out the talented cast.<br />LOOPER is an innovative and engrossing film, a nice change of pace from zombie and post-apocalyptic disasters.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Good movie sequel to the other Stan Lee projects. The actors were well cast and the sets were great. The special effects were incredible.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This was probably my least favorite book my Ms. Cornwell.  However, even at that it was a pretty good read.
B0085W09ME|1.0|Doesn't work on my Droid X. This app got very good reviews. Since I travel for business, I was looking forward to being able to utilize this app in a variety of ways.
1469984202|2.0|Started off interesting, but got bogged down in too much detail and became boring.  I just couldn't stand it anymore.  Excellent writing though, but the story just stopped moving for too long.  I'm very surprised about this because I bought this book based on all the positive reviews here.  Well, to each his own.  All I read is sci-fi and this just didn't cut it for me.
B009CPES4I|3.0|Although I enjoyed the fine cast, the story line has been told many times in far better ways.. Some of the characters scripts seemed old and tired rather than new and fresh.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|The amazing Gospel is hidden in this story!  I recommend this movie for families!  I'm glad I ordered it.  Thanks!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I've held off buying Game of Thrones, but after hearing the buzz and reading the reviews I gave in. It was exceptional and my husband loved it too. Can't wait for season 2.
1451695195|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  This book is a must read especially for anyone who's been adopted.  I recommend this book for spirtual seekers.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The US edition of DA Season 3 (original UK edition) is 3 disks, 526 minutes which includes in addition to the 9 episodes the 2012 Christmas in the Highlands as well as interview with Shirley MacLaine and some other behind the scenes specials.  Amazon offers the best price (PBS offers $39.99), an even better deal if free shipping. I can't wait until this arrives the end of January! After football season this will keep us occupied for some time! Just thought I would share this info.
B0014VQGX4|4.0|durable and well made, would recommend it for a long term keepsake, there is no mechanical controls on the back hoe. Keeping the backhoe in a upright position could be better.  It has a tendacy to drag on the floor when pushing the unit along.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|From the costumes to the characters to the history to the plot I l cannot wait to watch Season 3!
B0045XICB2|5.0|It is a movie, not much to say.  But, an excellent price.<br />I think I paid $3 for the movie, wonderful.
0425252868|5.0|An incredible story the tells the story from the german and the US side.  Reveals the truth about the german airman, rather then them being the monsters we were told they were, they were very much like our own boys and held to their high ideals.  Very few were nazis.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The movie ends up being a much different film than the trailers led me to believe, which is a really good thing.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Im not going to pick on this book. Plenty of other have already. Its an easy read, simply written and with a few repetitive annoyances, but it was enjoyable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am LOVE the Hunger Games !!!!!<br />Best series best EVER!!!!!<br />I couldn't drop this book . I got in trouble because I never put it down .l love the suspense it was a book I would recommend to everyone.
0674048849|5.0|I have the annotated Pride and Prejudice (edited by Patricia Meyer Spacks) and this is just as lively and informative. This edition offers new ways to see the work.... I hadn't, for example, kept up with 'thing theory&#34; but read about it here.... Don't hesitate.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. I would love to play the sequel when it comes out. Thank you very much.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|We loved this movie in the theater and love it just as much at home. Kids were so happy to get their own copy and amazon had it at a good price.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I heard about this book when Aisha Tyler had Seth Green on her 'Girl on Guy' podcast. I was looking for a book to read over my Christmas vacation. I met a fellow sci-fi geek and we sort of decided to read this book as part of a sci-fi themed book club.<br /><br />I read this book in a day and a half. The story is a fascinating one and brings up a lot of issues surrounding privacy in the online world. The hero is flawed, not perfect and is therefore pretty believable as a person existing in his world. Unlike 'The Matrix' trilogy of movies, 'Ready Player One' has compelling action in both the virtual and real worlds.<br /><br />It doesn't get a 5/5 for two reasons: The story seems a little contrived- not that there isn't drama, it just never felt like the outcome was in doubt in a given situation. I'm sure this is in part due to the fact that I'm an adult. As a teenager, I think I'd have loved this book. The other reason is there were times I got bogged down in the writing; not often, but in some places the descriptions got to be a little long- which could also be due to the fact that I grew up with a lot of the things Ernest Cline refers to from the late 70's-80's (I didn't play all the games mentioned, but am aware of many of them).<br /><br />If you ever were a gamer, care to think about online privacy issues vis a vis ISPs and companies providing services (IOI and GSS in the book, could be Comcast and Google today), or just like a good sci-fi story, I would recommend this book. It's a fun, quick read. Small spoiler: There's no Konami code as far as I could tell...which is good in a way since it's an obvious thing to use in a book like this and Cline probably wisely chose other games/movies to focus on. Still, it would have been fun to see it as an entry code somewhere. Or if it was hidden in the book, I missed it.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|This was a really funny movie.  If you like the Wimpy Kid series then you will love this movie.  My 11 year old loved it.
1419705849|5.0|I purchased the book for a grandchild, and he was delighted.  After receipt of this, I found out that another grandchild was excited to read the book also.  Nice hardback, reasonably priced.  Great purchase.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I really wanted to give the book 1 star, but Dr. Alexander put some effort into describing his illness and talking to other people about what his body looked like while he was so seriously ill.  That counts for something.  If he had an NDE, it is very different than any other that has been described by other people who have had one.  Well, sort of described, because the actual NDE was not really discussed in depth, and was more nightmarish than enlightening. It was a very disappointing book - and I love reading books about people's spiritual experiences (with the exception of &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34; which I thought was a story of two non-thinking parents).  Don't waste your time, because time is precious, or your money, because that can be better spent.
0525952926|5.0|I enjoyed the first and will enjoy thos one also I am sure.  One Two three four five six seven
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this app.I like that it is different than all the other apps.I cannot belive some proletariat giving it a bad reveiw they must have no taste.
0060589280|5.0|this was the main part of the whole order... i have been looking for the book for 10 years.. it was a life saver when amazon had this book!!! I would recommend this book to all the people who like paulo cohelo and read his books....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was by far one of the best books I have read in a while. I would highly recommend it. At first I was a little discouraged because the book was written about two high schoolers but it was nothing like I expected! Amazing!
097747609X|4.0|very eye opening, you really get a sense of what was going on in his head. you get a better understanding of this man.
0316069434|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He downloaded it to his MP3 and loving every minute of it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this app is very addicting.  I like this one better than cookie dozed. Too bad its not real coins cuz I rock at it
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Intriguing and suspense in every level. Every search is intense and very unique. You can never imaging the real thing. I love the graphics and the story.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I play this on my itouch and thought it would be awesome to play on my kindle, but this needs updated! where are the badges?!?! and all the different words!
B005T87QCI|5.0|this is my favirite thing to do everyday. and I have lots of players on my) team crap my mom is calling me to breafast
B002E66C6E|3.0|Way too many depth charges. The UBoat was realistic to the boat in Das Boot. But , Hollywood over did.the distroyer sub hunt.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Lots of characters to keep track of, and more than one \\"red herring\\" to throw off the reader. And surprisingly, more than one TYPO! Come on, guys, Richard Castle should have better editors than that. \\"Sweat Tea\\" anyone?<br /><br />But it was an enjoyable read, and now I'm off to download the next book in the series.
B009329Y30|5.0|This is a beautiful story of a women who has been hurt by a previous relationship and is afraid to love again.  Taylor Schilling's  performance was great and Zac Efron as a returning marine very ably protrayed a man that could not understand why he survived and his fellow marines did not. I really enjoy great love stories and love scene.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie will not change your life, but it will entertain. It was exactly the kind of movie I was looking for to cheer me up and give me a laugh.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, as an adult. I don't think that this book is for teenagers like it may suggest. The main topics: drugs, depression and suicide. Very good read for someone with their head on their shoulders.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie is not what I had expected. The whole family got together to watch this over amazon instant video and everyone was blown away by how it exceeded expectations.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|I have read and enjoyed all of his previous books but I could never really get into this one.  When I finished, I thought &#34;What was that all about?&#34;
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The movie was entertaining but resembled the born identity as much as the original total recall. No Mars. Several drawn out action sequences.
0385344333|3.0|I'm a big Reacher fan and have read all of the others in the series.  This was a big letdown. It took too long to get into any action and the plot was kind of weak as far as who were the good and bad guys and what was the reason for what they did,
B009JBZH54|5.0|5 disk set includes:<br />Batman Begins (movie and extras on 1 disk)<br />The Dark Knight (1 disk for Movie and 1 disk for the extras<br />The Dark Knight Rises (1 Disk for Movie and 1 disk for extras)<br /><br />The extra bonus was the download code for the digital version. I wasnt expecting that for the price, so a nice bonus for sure.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I rate this book a four. It's funny and I could not put the book down. Can't wait to read the next book.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Love the beat and helps get the mind off everyday stresses. Not music for the kids because of the language but great for excercise and traveling.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the dramatic turn at the end. I was not expecting it. I am still unsure what will come in the next.
B00005QB42|4.0|A very good cd for people requiring a sound sense of solitude.Deva Premal has a great voice.Can be a bit tedious at times but the standout track-Gaytri Mantra-makes it great for meditation.Although I enjoyed this cd,I'd have to say it is an acquired taste.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It was a good movie will smith did his thing as usual.. Tommy lee Jones was also hilarious  will watch again ...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. It's the best book I've read in a long time.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This was a quick read for me and truth be told I LOVE a good court drama.  it's standard grisham storytelling but again I LOVE it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I downloaded it for our youngest holiday visitor and in less than one hour everyone was playing it.  Some were driven to get to the 9x9 level asap!
B00000IZOR|5.0|Great phone for baby to play with- not too loud, encourages pretend play.  Colors are eye catching and it is just cute to look at.  My niece loves this toy!
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|The sort of great humor, outstanding animation and entertaining storyline we know to expect from this series.  These movies have the fast action and slapstick humor that the kids love, and yet the sly, subtle humor us adults can enjoy, and some valuable life lessons for all of us.  And it was just the right length.<br /><br />A good part of the fun for me was how the illustrators manage to make the characters look soooo much like the actors who portray them!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I liked this movie, but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be.  There were a couple of twists and the end left room for interpretation, but it just didn't WOW me like I thought it would.  Still a good movie, but I don't expect it to win any awards.
B007EECSFA|4.0|always a twist. just when i thought i knew how it would turn out, she threw me a curveball. enjoyable book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is great for teenagers. It shows the real perspective of a freshman in high school. I think everyone would enjoy this.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|We thought it was funny and full of teenage angst. We watched it three times and each time it was just as funny. It's going to be cult.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was excellent, just like the first! I am officially on to the last book and am so excited! Great read!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It is quite elegant and i love the grey Simple in design and so easy to fold<br />when wanting to prop it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Truly horrible...I am amazed at the popularity of this book.  After getting through &#34;the contract&#34;...put it down.  I could see where this was going and had absolutely no interest to read further.
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|A classic Disney movie and highly recommended for the whole family! A perfect tale of finding love in the least likely of places!!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|CGI in this movie was great, but I still found it lacking. LOVE Charlize Theron, but her voice was forced and didn't seem natural. Had heard Kristen Stewart didn't change her facial expressions throughout the movie... and found out it was true.  :-( Watched it a couple of times, but don't think I'll be owning this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the second book I have read by Green. He is an amazing writer who knows how to pull at my heart strings as well as making me see a lot of myself in his characters. The fault in our stars is a great read and I finished it in a day.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Could not stop reading this book. It's my first Jodi Picoult book and I have to say that I will definitely read another one.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This was a good read! I gave it a 4 for the story line and the interest it kept. I recommend it for a quick read!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|A big let down.This Ridley Scott film displays story-telling ineptitude hidden by clever special effects.The film doesn't engage the solar-plexus,the characters are not developed,the pacing is wrong.In Alien we get to know the 7 characters well.Here,big ideas are let down by not being grounded or believable.The only space we inhabit is cerebral.It has a detached,clinical feel;the dialogue full of pseudo-scientific conceptions that feel unreal. Even `want' is seen as a concept by David(Fassbinder)the android.Fassbinder steals the movie as the gentle robot who models himself on O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia and oversees the sleeping astronauts' dreams,does tests/examinations on them.Its all in the script. Ridley Scott has picked up a story which he made 30 years ago and tried to re-imagine it and failed to the highest order in his attempts. This was a movie made specifically to be part of a larger framework - at least a sequel and probably a trilogy. The meaning of life, immortality, the punishment by the gods, the source of humanity, evolution vs creation, religion,the scope was too big for the story,too cluttered for alien life to fit into a context.No awe,wonder,panic or dread as in Alien.Shucks!<br /><br />Star Wars did prequels inferior to the 1st trilogy.Scott has seen Alien sequels and wanted to cut them away and do a reboot return to origins,as the original director.Scott takes the Space Jockey-the dead giant humanoid pilot with burst chest found in the crashed spaceship along with the alien eggs-and ask where he came from.Prometheus shows an Earth expedition that happens on the site before Alien.There is no paranoia or claustrophobia in this version.The people who created us want us wiped out.This is like old concepts of disaster being visited on Earthlings for original sins.Beset here by ancient alien genetic engineering of humanity a la 2001 and Von Daniken.The director takes precedence over the writer Lindelof.Alien was hard-pressed,uplit,down-beat,post-industrial,a simple shocker about people we wondered would live through the next 5 minutes.That universe had been deeply thought-about, contained mysteries,had a sense of knowing more than it told,showed didn't tell.Prometheus is a complex movie asking big questions about the nature of the universe.Alien's modesty made it awesome,revealing mysteries and horrors embedded in its fabric(Of that which we cannot speak we must remain silent).<br /><br />I liked Noomi Rapace's Dr Elizabeth Shaw,she reprises some of Ripley's quick,fiery ferocity and anguish.Prometheus struggles to reconcile its origins-of-life quest with the need to deliver regular gloopy shocks.Here all surprise has been evicerated, most characters made expendable.There is a plot-twist reveal that is a non-event.The mission is to \\"overturn 3 centuries of darwinism\\".Like yeh.Ideas are add-ons not component parts.The later Alien's graphics look earlier than Prometheus's CGI fx(as they are,its just the director that used CGI as the Emperor's New Clothes to hide the shallowness of creationism run wild).From such a cast,so little.From such a director we expected so much.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|When I first downloaded this book I had no clue what to expect. Come to find out it was a good book, even brought tears to my eyes at times. If you enjoy romance novels and love stories I recommend this boom.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this game. It makes you think, it is challenging and fun. Although I really think that there should be SOME way to regenerate free hints. Three hints, and you are out, for as long as you have the game unless you maybe buy them or reinstall your game. The game is challenging, and sometimes I have been stuck so long that having a hint would have kept me playing longer.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a beautifully written story. Love the twists and turns as well as the pure and passionate love between Sky and Holder.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|The Descendants cd is great - I had already heard it so knew I would love it.  I would recommend it.
B0046BQ06W|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my son-in-law.  He was really excited to get it.  Thank you for having vinyl.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I've used this adapter and it works like a charm.  Just plug it in and it is ready to go.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Everyone I talked to said this was a very funny movie. I laughed, but it wasn't a very funny or good movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice; I just need to figure out how to change the orintation of the cards so that the Aces are at the top instead of down the side.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun and frustrating but addictive! :) My husband has had it on his i phone for months, I teased him for playing it now  He is the one laughing.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Takes me back to my childhood and setting in front of the TV challenging my brother to a game of pac man

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had me rooting for the guy which i never do. I could not put this book down it kept you wanting to find out what happened next. Would have gave it 5 stars if the ending was different but overall, what an amazing book!
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I enjoyed the special effects, but the plot and acting was horrible.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for the rental.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|it the worst.I have bought this app trust me.you have to pay for things after you pay for the app. Do Not Buy This!
B003L77GG0|4.0|I watched this hoping for a triumphant end.  Of course all the cost cutting and rushed storylines did this in. Dark died is an epic villain and got the Galactus cloud treatment by never seeing him. Lionel's double had solo much promise as did Lex returning. I think this show went on too long and burnt out. I so wanted to see Welling in full suit mode and got a neck shot with cape, a CGI doll for Superman and then Luthor  all but a zombie clone at the end. The use of John Williams at the end and Clark finally ripping his shirt open should have come years earlier. I hung through Small ville since the start and wished the CW had listened to fans and pulled out all the stops this season. All in all the DVD set is well made and should please the hard core fans.
B004SB60OC|5.0|I saw Christina Perry in concert this summer and I had to have her CD. Love the music and the price was right.
1781163243|4.0|I gave this book to a friend, and only got a couple seconds to look through it. But from what i saw, it was a really neat book. The art was amazing, and I learned a lot about the Halo universe.
B0058RN85O|5.0|After seeing seeing season 1 from the Library, I knew I had to get the season series on DVD. The best show on TV.
B004Z7AHTI|1.0|Had to exchange the first copy of this Blu-ray I received because the video playback stuttered.  The replacement I received also did stuttered, and on multiple Blu-ray players.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|After seeing the first episode, I was sold on this show being a classic. I had to get the season series and will collect all of them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun addicting easy clean fun. Can't put it down. Fun for kids and adults.if u run outta coins you have to wait a bit but it's not too bad
B0053O89U6|5.0|This is about the best show on TV. I have to get the season series. I can't wait once a week to see the next episode.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|This movie was just plain ignorant. Unless you like a talking teddy bear smoking pot, it is awful. We were so disappointed that we didn't make it past 45 minutes.
B000001ABD|5.0|Stevie Wonder is a superstar. You get it all his best from this  2 cd set. I got a great deal as well.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|could not download onto phone so have not gone back to try to fix it. No more to say to you.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Amazing book! I truly loved it! my daughter got a kindle fire for Christmas and I've took her kindle a load of times and can't pull my eyes away! Awesome!
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I think this book is very exciting it doesn't give away very much in the beginning of this story can't wait for reading the rest of the series. I'd give. it a 5 out of five stars
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the dairy of a wimpy kid series! I truly loved this new one! I hope that Jeff Kinney writes LOADS more wimpy kid books!
B006O3MU96|2.0|The product came and it was made out of cheap plastic, and was put together poorly, I would recomend looking for a different brand!
0316172324|4.0|Well written and easy to read, this book has some useful insights despite some parts that may not be appealing to everyone. Those who are willing to be honestly introspective will benefit. Those who instead seek to point fingers at others and lay blame will also find useful ammunition (sadly).
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Absolutely amazing concert.  Perhaps it's the great surround sound and DTS system I use, but the sound is absolutely amazing. Now if you're looking for the EXACT original content of the hits, then you might want to pass. For most fans of that memorable 70's music, this one is for you. Great concert (and the bonus material takes you back even farther). If your era is \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", then this concert will mesmerize you. You might even want to wear your best polyester before you hit the PLAY button.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It relives stress and is challenging but rewarding when you finanny see that star appear to let you know you have won the challenge.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|While the album has limitations - namely the number of songs they've chosen - some of the best tunes are there including &#34;Wrong Song,&#34; &#34;Buried Under,&#34; and &#34;No One Will Ever Love You&#34; which, I'll add, I've listened to 6000 times already.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I love this movie. Where has it been hiding? The story was great. I like time travel stories. The acting was over the top.<br />One minor complaint, I knew the ending about 30 seconds before the end came because the background narration gave it away. Let the viewer watch the movie and figure out why it ended like it did. We are not dumb. But most other movies explain things we don't need to know. (Resident Evil Retribution is one of the worst movies I've seen because the narrator spend half a day explaining what the movie was about. Besides the fact that R.E.R. was ridiculous.) One other small complaint, this movie at times had the actors speaking so low that I could not understand them. I hate that. But it still gets five stars from me.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Loved this movie.  Was a clear look into a marriage where communication has been lost.  Very moving yet very funny.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jone were great!
1452110581|5.0|Very entertaining book- clever poems & just perfect for small gift for your favorite cat lover! (I alsmost kept for myself!)
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was awesome the most awesome one of all I loved it every one needs to read this book !
B000002H5I|5.0|Had this in a cassette and wanted to replace with a CD.  Many great songs on this album!  Love it.
B008D37SGU|5.0|I have never seen an English (British) film before. I must admit I struggled with adjusting to the pace of British films, but after the first 30 minutes I was good. In my opinion this movie illustrates love to perfection. A little spoiler alert, but this is not a happy love story. However I still think it is perfect. If you have ever been in a toxic relationship this movie is perfect for you. The acting is superb. The entire movie is very simplistic but spares no details.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this in a couple of days.  Was hard to put down.  It totally keeps your interest with unexpected twists and turns.  Highly recommended.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Do not want to repeat all the others, just to add one thing. This book makes you feel totally different!<br />A lot of stuff which it did not make sense to me makes it now. I am grateful for every minute that I spent reading it.<br />I think it is truly one of the most important books that I ever had a chance to read, if not THE one! I am now starting the sequel Destiny of the Souls. Does anyone know of any of Dr. Newton's scholars?<br />Five stars all over the place!
B008DL466C|3.0|Over the course of 2012, Wiz dropped two mixtapes, Taylor Allderdice, which was an established classic for the spring and then there was Cabin Fever 2, mixtape hosted by DJ Holidae and westside reppin mcs Problem and Iam$u.  Also there were dropped singles, such as Bed rest freestyle and remix to 2 Chainz \\"No lie\\". The album kept being pushed back I really felt they should have stuck to the original date in August, because Cabin Fever wasn't as original as Cabin Fever for the release of ROlling papers.<br /><br />If Taylor Allderdice was the album with a nice mix from attracted hits from singles, I really believe his album would have sold better. O.N.I.F.C has really thrown most of his fans for loop because it's a more of a different field with his melody while his lyrics is more focus on family, happiness, and money.  Furthermore, its a different feel that hasn't set in fans, but hopefully if it's listened to multiple times. The new Wiz hasn't fully been accepted either, but who know's the future of Wiz. Although the album was #2 right below Taylor Swift's album, it sold lesser copies than the release of Rolling papers in 2011.
B001QJUX24|1.0|I've watched several movies with instant streaming and had no problems.  I have tried no fewer than 10 times to watch this movie and can't get past the :24 mark - yes, 24 seconds.  I've seen the first 24 seconds at least 10 times and cannot get it to go any farther.  Tried sending feedback to Amazon, but as I'm typing the issue, the feedback screen goes away - apparently they don't want to know about the problem.
B001DJLD1M|4.0|I would have liked to have had the dvds in their own little flap or something just because I was a little worried about them being scratched just sitting on top of one another. The order shipped fast and arrived a day earlier than originally scheduled.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Gratuitous violence and evil.  The story line depends to some extent on having watched the previous dark night movie.  This movie is over-hyped.  The acting is so so.  The special effects are very good.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It even made me cry towards the end. What SEALS go through is not only hard on them, but on their families as well. The life of Adam Brown is not only a testament of what a soldier is, but a father, husband, and child of God. His life may not have been going the way he wanted it to, but in end, it did.

B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book was even better than I expected. This and The Heroes of Olympus are my two favorite book series so far. Keep up the good work Mr Riordan.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Proof of Heaven doesn't &#34;prove&#34; anything. Just another NDE book. Don't waste your time unless you are into fantasies or sci-fi.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|For me this title is readable and pretty well done. Enough for me to like it and read the next installment(s). I would caution that the protagonist feels very familiar at times. Almost like a blend of Kvothe/John Snow. This could just be an accident of perception,as those characters sit strong on the mind for many contemporary fantasy readers,so I didn't downgrade the rating for that. My main criticism would be that I would like to see the settings fleshed out with a little more attentiveness and color(so to speak)given to descriptions. However,that may just be the authors style, and I would prefer he not get ham handed with it if that were the trade off.<br /><br />The theme of persecution that runs through the story comes on a little strong for me,but it's not a deal breaker by any means.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Lots of fun trying to get the small pigs with the small brids I like the differt bilding its a lot of fun
1451695195|4.0|This is an interesting book on Near Death Experiences (NDEs)  The most interesting aspect is that Dr. Eben Alexander is a nuerosurgeon so he has a real good idea how the brain works.  The other aspect of the book is that he did not believe in NDEs until he had one.  I wish he had gone into more detail about the NDE but as he writes in his book it is really hard to describe eternal life in this life.  It is definitely worth reading.
B008MEM24S|3.0|this app will not download on my kindle fire. always says error can not download.<br /><br />I have this on my ipad2 and is a great game for kids and adults.<br /><br />Disney please fix this problem.<br /><br />if you have a kindle fire with troubles getting this app please post a review
B008WCP2PG|5.0|this was a very good DVD  Thanks so much  In great shape  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa+++++++++++++  would buy again  great  product  in good shape
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The Good Story is a fantastic adventure. The meaning behind the good story is up to you. A top 5 book.
0375507256|2.0|I knew going into this novel that the stories are told in a unique style, one falling into the next. Still I found the book a little hard to stay with, or to care much about the characters. I heard from people who saw it that the movie based on the novel was even more confusing it that is possible. Not for those who like light reading.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This was a great follow-up to the 50 shades trilogy! I am looking forward to the May release of the third of this series.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|action packed one you need to pay attention to will more then likely watch again!!!!!  plus the wife enjoyed it also
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a great follow-up to the 50 shades trilogy! I am looking forward to the May release of the third of this series.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Was very funny and heartwarming.  Would be great for family, mother/daughter, and everyone else!  Cant wait to get the movie for myself!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this after my iphone took one too many dips in the toilet (I am a mother of a toddler).  The product was not straightforward to assemble and I watched their on line video no less than 3 times to make sure I got it right.  I realize it’s difficult to make a 100% watertight seal and I followed their instructions to the letter!  Unfortunately after painstakingly sealing up the phone I realized that my iphone charger won't fit into the charging slot when the case is on!!!!!!!!  I had to re-open the case every night to charge it - which is a total ordeal and completely defeats the purpose of all that painstaking sealing process.  Once you open the seal you have to do it all over again the next day.  I scrutinized the case for hours trying to figure out why the iphone plug doesn't fit and I have come to the conclusion that its simply poor design.  I can't imagine any charging device fitting into the slot because the lip of the door will always get in the way.  Additionally no matter how hard I clean, rub, air spray, etc to get the perfect seal there is always a bit of space between my phone and the plastic making it difficult to push the buttons and make contact with the screen.  I have to press really hard just to dial a number or click on an icon.  This was not a cheap product and I paid $50 for a useless piece of plastic.  I am totally writing a complaint to the company and returning this item!!!
1476712042|4.0|I must say, I didn't expect anything at all that happened in this book. Just when I expected something to definitely happen, the opposite occurred.<br /><br />It's like one big emotional roller coaster, but without the usual heavy sulking on the lead female characters part (which i absolutely loved)!!<br /><br />Read this book in under 24 hours and think i'm gonna read it again now. Some books deserve a twice over, and this is one of them.<br /><br />Enjoy guys!
B008M36EEI|3.0|It was a decent flick. Not bad or the best. Wouldn't want to pay to see it at a movie theater, but good for a rental. I like Emily Blunt so that helped.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good story, but reminded me of another story I've read quite recently.  Still, I enjoyed it. It's the same type of love story, I've read sooooo many times before.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|3 stars only because my husband seriously laughed out loud a lot! I fell asleep (until the next lol)!<br /><br />Guy movie only!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great read!! A true changing of the guard... Jack Jr shows he has it too... Just like dad. Clancy tells a great tale,  p wrong all the bases; but still leaving you wanting more.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Very interesting better than the first excited to read the next book. At the end of every chapter a new twist to keep you reading
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Ones opened a time there was  three little girls and had a big  family  they had  2 brothers  and 4 sisters and a Neaf
B007N8RULO|5.0|Very challenging and addicting. I keep playing til I win! When I get desperate I can use the undo button.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Greek and Roman mythology fascinate me, and Riordan is one of my favorite authors. He has brought two of my favorite things together: reading and mythology. Thank you Rick Riordan, you have brought me great joy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love the &#34;voice&#34; and personality conveyed in of the characters. The chapters are short and it swings from Nick to Amy and their perspectives on life and each other. One of the top reads for me this year!
B009MCRHH6|1.0|This game is so boring and I never play it anymore. It doesn't make any sense and is really hard.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazingly great read I couldn't put it down from the moment I started the first chapter and I started the second book right away!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book in one day and I cannot wait to read the third. I never know what will happen next and it keeps me flying by the seat of my pants. Loved it!
B009D3CTVS|5.0|First of all, I only paid $22 for this adaptor a couple of days ago, but the supplier (Streamline Audio Video) appears to have run out.  List price is a little steep.    Some basic info:    o The overall length is about 6 feet five inches.    o The in/out midi cables are clearly marked, as in \\"connect to midi in\\" and \\"connect to midi out\\".  Other cables are confusing because they consider themselves to be a midi device.  I think of this cable as more of an adaptor, and so the non-ambiguity of the labeling is much appreciated.    o The software comes on a CD and it up to date as of this writing (1/2/13).  It is version 1.0.0.  I checked the download site for updates, and 1.0.0 is the latest.  ----    I used the CD to load the driver, rebooted the mac, and hooked the cable up.  It worked first time.    I tested it with the \\"Audio MIDI Setup\\" app which is in the \\"Utilities\\" folder under Applications on the mac.  Make sure you select the MIDI window and expand the window in case the new device shows up off the main page (it happened to me).    Try testing both channels by selecting the UM-ONE device, clicking on \\"Test Setup\\", and then clicking on the UP/DOWN arrows.  You should hear the synthesizer in your piano make some noise when you send to it, and you should observe the arrows flash on the mac when you send from the piano keyboard .    After that, I used \\"MIDI Monitor\\" (free from [...]) to verify that the interface was sending data from the yamaha DGX-500.    Then I started using it with GarageBand 09 and everything worked fine.    If you carefully read the reviews for other products of this type, as I did, you will find a large range of experience, both good and bad.  I was scared off enough from all the other alternatives to try the Roland device, based on their reputation for quality gear.    I also have a MIDI-Sport 2x2 from M-Audio, and I wasted a lot of time trying to get it to work with the DGX-500.  The problem turned out to be insufficient USB power - i.e., after hooking up the midi-sport to a powered USB hub, it finally started to send from the piano  (also make sure you pull the latest drivers).  I never could get it to send from the mac to the piano, however.    I think some of the problems with other devices may be due to how much power they draw from the USB bus.  If you can't get yours to work, try a powered hub.    I didn't want to deal with a powered hub, which is why I purchased the UM-ONE, and I'm glad I did.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Really funny and entertaining<br />I like her show and her book! For two dollars it is worth buying! I liked it
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Good father-daughter movie with baseball -- what more can one ask for?  Clint is as good in a similar roles he had in the past.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|Nothing very special about this version. Not much of a tutorial, and the tiles are kind of hard to differentiate from each other. Try Hungry Cats version for much more entertaining play, and cute tile design.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Having played Minecraft on the PC for so long this pocket addition takes a little getting use too. Once you figure it out, it plays very well. Great way to pass the time when I'm in between small trips around town.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Not the easiest to figure out how to use, no extra features, it just basically turns on the Kindle's camera, which I doubt that I will use much.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have a few pocket knives that I've had for many years that needed some help. I decided to give this tool a try and I've been happy so far, especially on the serrated areas of the knives. Are you going to get the greatest edge possible with a tool like this? Of course not. Can it help bring your dull pocket/utility knives back to life so that they actually cut again? Definitely. For the price, it was just what I was looking for.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|We love this movie and watch it at least once during the Christmas season.  Now our grandchildren are laughing with us.  As many times as we've watched it we still find things that we have missed.
8862931921|5.0|Easy. Portable. Wonderfully made, as to be expected from Moleskine. They are wonderful notebooks and I use this one as a portable sketchpad.
0761163808|5.0|Gave this to relatives who had a super exciting African trip this past year and they were thrilled with the book as it brought back memories of their safari.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Great book, lots of information.  This will help you understand how everything works together.  I will learn a lot from this book.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I never had any desire to see Paris until seeing this film. I still don't want to see it because I cannot see it as depicted in this motion picture. It has become a favorite film. As with all films by Woody Allen, it has his usual outstanding music selections.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|While Tommy Lee is looking his age, this was a different spin on a story that spans nearly 15 years at this point.  We purchased the combo pack so that we could utilize the UV code so we can watch the movies on our time and location desired.  While we still have DVDs, I am interested at expanding through adding UV copies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app idea's to save favorite websites and to be able to organize them on different boards for future reference. the best part yet, is to get inspirational ideas and share with friends and others who have a common interest as well. its pretty awesome!
B008QI6EHQ|4.0|I have read this  book mulitple times and continue to read it for furthering my person education.  People do not realize how brilliant Hitler was, but at the same time a complete psychopath.  People need to understand that if we do not learn from people like this, then we will fall into their traps again.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was a fun read if you are a fan of Harry Bosch! I breezed through it  and stayed on the treadmill almost an hour to finish!!
B005LAII08|5.0|We love having the mulitiple types of movies available.  It is unfortunate that the digital copy has to written onto a single  computer and is not available in a cloud format like Amazon, ITune, Vudu and UV video services.  I wish Disney would start allowing these movies to be readily available to their buyers.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Clare Danes is gritty and believable as Carrie, a bi-polar CIA agent, navigating her way through using her high intellect to successfully perform her job as well as the downfall of the same in her personal life.  POW Nick Brody is rescued after 8 years of captivity under the terrorist Abu Nazir.  It is Carrie's job to decide whether or not he is a hero or a turned agent with a plan to take vengeance on the U.S.<br />Seriously good t.v.
B009MO5ES8|5.0|This movie is an instant favorite, the kind i'll watch many times. It just arrived in the mail today and the story was riveting. I bicycle commute to work daily in dallas, tx so i can somewhat relate to the intense adrenaline moments in this film. Five stars - epic!

0140067477|4.0|I really enjoyed this read. Hoff does a great job of explaining the basic tenents of Taoism in a context most Westerners are familiar. I recommend this book to anyone one with a curious and open mind.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|its a fun game but one you have to spend money and two you need friends. That's why only 3 stars from me.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I am only on page ten and it is already a five star book. I love it so very much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is such an awesome book.. I cannot tell you how it gripped me from each day. The first day caught your interest as to why the seemingly tantrum. Then it unfolds to a beautiful story with untold twist. You cannot put it down because you want to know the story, and by then you have laughed, cried been ready to fight and just tore up with emotion.I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! \\"Salute\\" Colleen Hoover!! I thought I was in love with Travis (Beautiful Disaster), but Dean Holder is truly A W E S O M E!!
0525953728|5.0|I pre-ordered this book to get it the day it was released. Bearing that in mind, I didn't put it down once I opened the package. At this late date, there's not a lot of information that's not already in the public domain that's &#34;new&#34; in this book. You will find some interesting aspects to life as a SEAL that you may not have considered. Given there hasn't been any litigation re: this book, I tend to think it's a very accurate account. I'll be interested to see how this book compares to the movie Zero Dark 30.<br /><br />If you're a history buff, this is probably a worthy addition to your library. If you're looking for &#34;new&#34; info re: the OBL raid, you're not likely to find it in this book, though it is an entertaining read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The mini games are great for wasting a bit of time.  Simple to play, adds interest by making you get a certain score to unlock New games.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Inventive concepts.  Difficult to watch on the computer because the sound was extremely low in parts.  It also crashed about 15 times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great!<br />I couldn't put this book down. I can't wait to start the next book and read about what happens to district twelve.
B004A8ZX28|1.0|while this movie was actually very good, it did not star liam neeson!  it had great suspense and i enjoyed it.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have read many of Grisham's novels.  I recently read Grisham's THE CONFESSION which, in my opinion, really packed a punch.  I'm sure that Grisham had entertainment in mind, when he wrote THE RACKETEER, but the plot was too complicated, and the cleverness he was going for was totally lost on me.  I almost abandoned it.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|i enjoy watching this movie over and over again.  i love the old man who says that anna nicole married for love!  highly recommended
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoy the game but my progress wasn't randomly erased...characters and coins gone. Worth the download...I just hope they fix it. Will keep playing despite the loss of my game

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|it is an incredibly funny book with lots of wacky things and good and silly drawings with awesome illustrations it's awesome
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love to play it when I am bored! It will keep me busy for hours! There are so many games that you can play and earning the points to get to buy different games makes me play even more!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is more challenging the farther you progress in it. I love the apps that challenge my mind and my problem solving skills...works great on my fire....ENJOY....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game seems like it would be dumb especially compared to temple run but its way more fun I hope you love it as much as me!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book is so awesome I love the Diary of a wimpy kid series in my opinion Jeff Kinney is brilliant

B008QTV3X0|5.0|streams very well in HD; no buffering or skipping. the show is incredible, i am hooked and will purchase season 2 as soon as i am done with this season.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love the game, wish it were easier to get bombs so I could expand the word choices.  I won't pay money to enhance the game.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Can listen to his hits anytime of the day so this is a great pick up. Also consider the genesis albums too.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|Had anyone told me that Les Mis songs could be ruined I would have scoffed.....until this movie.  I get that they wanted actors to emote, however stage performers in musicals can also emote - and many are fine actors - and do their scenes in one take, by the way.  Most of the songs are butchered in this movie.<br /><br />As far as a soundtrack, it's simple.  Everyone involved in the production of this movie says they went a different route and its not just about the singing.  Great - for a movie perhaps, but a soundtrack of badly performed songs?<br /><br />Crowe is incredibly bad, Jackman not far behind. Hathaway would get a 'Thank you. Next!' at a Community Playhouse.  Amanda Seyfried is OK.  Carter, plain awful.  I am not trying to bash these actors.  I truly enjoy Crowe's acting and Gladiator is one of my all time favorites, and Anne Hathaway is adorable.  They simply don't sing very well.<br /><br />The lone strong vocal performance is Samantha Barks, but you can get her performance as Eponine, and many other great renditions of Les Mis songs, in the Les Mis 25th Anniversary concert DVD.<br /><br />Unless you somehow found the vocal performances in this movie pleasing, avoid this CD.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I did not quite buy why Darcy fell for Jemima Rooper instead of Lizzie, but it was interesting to see yet another take on the all the beloved characters,
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is a great book about World war II. I WOULD RECOMMENDED it to a teenage or older audience. It is different than most books about this topic and most books at all because it is narrated by Death.
044042321X|4.0|This hardcover compiles the first 6 numbers of this comic series. It has a lot of worthy extras just as mentioned in the product description.<br /><br />When a written masterpiece is publicly acclaimed by public and experts, other art forms adapt it and capitalize on the achieved renown. That is completely true relating to Game of Thrones. First it was the games (Roleplaying games, card games and boardgames), then art books, HBO's Television series, and now a comic book series. It is a logical and welcome progression, since each experience is different and allows the reader/viewer/gamer to experience several facets of this extremely rich world George Martin gave us.<br /><br />Daniel Abraham masterfully adapted with extreme care the text, Very faithful to the original but providing us with an important visual input. The art by Patterson is competent, although uninspired; his backgrounds are fabulous, but the characters lack somewhat personality and individualism...I believe he can do much better. Some covers by Mike Miller and Alex Ross are truly gorgeous.<br /><br />Obviously I will not comment the plot...you certainly already now it, and if you don't I would be ruining it for you.<br /><br />This is a competent adaptation and I will certainly continue to collect this series.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This<br /><br /> is a great game it is so fun u can go and find animals and rescue them and lots more it's great u can breed and cross breed and more the only thing I don't like is that it's very hard to get peanuts
B0000027F8|5.0|This album came out when I was still in high school; I loved Wham as a teeny-bopper but had hated Faith with a passion, so I ignored this album at first. But then a friend who was a huge GM fan played the cassette for me in my car, and I was hooked.<br /><br />I replaced my cassette with the cd while in college (when cd's were first coming out, and OMG does that date me or what!) but it had disappeared into the mists of time after multiple moves. Then for some reason last week I decided to download the album, and I've been playing it pretty much non-stop ever since.<br /><br />The next album, Older, is also a wonderful album with a similar jazzy/soul feel, but this is the one for me. Every song is terrific in its own way, nothing is a throw-away or a filler. Spend the money on this album, you won't be disappointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|I thought it was just fun for me but when the grandkids come over they fight over devicesto play temple run on!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It kept my interest and made it hard to put down. It made me laugh and sad. I would recommend it to anyone
B008N1V11U|4.0|the game was pretty good....beat it now on to the next one.....coulda made it a little long but its all good
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I got this book because I had heard so many people talking about the movie, and how good it was. I was skeptical at first, when I started reading it, but it developed into an amazing story. Sometimes the person who talks the least, thinks the most. Seriously, if you haven't read this, please do. It will not disappoint you!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Too short. I could keep reading, finished the book in less than a day. Couldn't put it down but to go to sleep.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I gave it a 4 stars rating for story plot, then added another star for superb acting.  I gave season 1 a four star but this season had better acting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game of Solitare is a simple game but it improves my dexterity, speed and thinking ability.  I like the game and I am addicted to it.  It is a good way to start a computer session before engaging in real work..
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Dawkins is fantastically thorough in his methodical deconstruction of organized religion. It seems he has answered every conceivable theistic argument while simultaneously bringing hope and beauty into the Godless universe.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I have to say that this game is so much fun! But I am having some trouble unlocking levels. I do suggest this app though!!!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I guess I wasnt fully sure what was gonig on in the movie but the plot was much deeper(and gruesome) then I expected.  I really enjoyed the movie.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|While I am sure the author is convinced of the actual physical experience, it still doesn't explain how he could recall it if his brain was totally non-functioning.  I would like to see interviews of non english-speaking NDE's from different cultures.  I really am curious as to how Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, et al, resolve the dogma and territorial issues, and whether God answers to different names when addressed by those of different culture!  So much we don't know and so much to learn!
1452110581|5.0|Author has a wonderfully refreshing cat's eye point of view of the world around him and of life in it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just remind yourself to ignore the pop up ads (every.  Single. Time.)and you will like this free app.  Remember it is FREE.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This was my 'go to' gift this Christmas season for the adult guys in my family.  Very challenging and fun.  Nice to give a gift that wasn't some how connected to a computer, television, i pad, play-station ect....
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Glad this show got picked up for a 3rd season. It's one of the best shows on TV. A must-watch.  Warning: it's addictive.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|would of been better with more colors to choose from for instance brighter colors, like blue, red, orange, green, yellow
B005544V6A|5.0|Watch the free pilot episode and you will be hooked.  It only gets better after that.  Great acting, writing, filming and storylines.  Humor, romance, character study, law.  What's not to like.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved every page! The characters were sweet and engaging, and the plot was both fun and romantic. Two thumbs way up!
B00632HWOG|4.0|multiple accounts can be open at one time, no signing in and out, just change account you are viewing.  deleting and moving to folders easy
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Didn't like it at first but then it got compelling and I found myself emotionally involved and couldn't put it down.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Beyond addicting... once you start 1 episode you will not stop until you finish the season.<br />Both actors deserved their Emmy.
B000FC130E|5.0|I enjoy fiction about an invented world in which apply different rules than on Earth but that is at the same time a comment on our society. This book is inventive. Not boring. You couldn't guess the outcome. I liked the main heroes of the story. I would welcome the follow up on the rescue of the abducted sister.
1846556007|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the first of the Jo Nesbo's books.  I now have more insight into the character.  My only negative remarks that sometimes he tends to philosophize. I enjoy the twists in the story.  It makes it more exciting.  I'm looking forward to the Cockroach translated into English and in paperback. Also,  The latest, Phantom in paperback.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|After watching Chimamanda Adichie's talk at TED.com I was so impressed by her that I had to look up the novel she mentioned. Turns out it wasn't this one, but rather Purple Hibiscus, her first novel. Still, the title alone made me curious and I downloaded it to my Kindle.<br /><br />I had never read an African author before, telling stories about Africa, stories IN Africa. If you'd asked me, I would have said I wasn't all that interested, that I didn't much care about politics and that this would probably be too foreign a topic to hold my interest.<br /><br />I was absolutely wrong, and am glad to stand corrected! The story of several Nigerians throughout the period before and during the Biafran revolution is intense, powerful and compelling. I could relate to the feelings evoked and the poignant senses awakened by her simple, beautiful prose. It was such an interesting read that I not only went after her other books but started looking around for other African authors - remember, this is coming from someone who was turned off by the mere topic. I have learned enough to know that there's much more to learn, and am really thankful to have found this amazing author.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Joe Levitt's new upper lip had more charisma and ethos than either of the two characters. Willis shoots children and Levitt shoots up. There is a time paradox, but it seems slow in coming and anticlimactic after it's over. This had a big enough budget to get Joss Whedon to edit the script. It's too bad the actors didn't demand it. Don't see this movie, check your email instead. It'll be more gratifying.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|I became a fan of Hitchen's wit and sharp observations about human beliefs, religions, and behavior several years ago when I discovered him while reading Vanity Fair. I found this final book of his to be a sad goodbye- with touches of humor and grace, as expected.. such a voice. Such an utterly free mind. Whether or not you ascribe to his viewpoint, you will learn deep lessons from his excursions into life, its approaching end, and everything in between. A short read, and a poignant window into a brilliant and utterly human life.
B0033AX26I|2.0|While we have listened to many versions of the Chieftains music and loved how they combine Irish traditional with other cultural music - this mix just didn't connect - likely won't listen to it very much
B008HK3TXK|5.0|I love this case for my Kindle Fire HD. The fit is secure and very functional and CUTE, works very well for the stand and protection.
B0043A0PXU|4.0|Normally not a fan of Christmas music we found this an interesting mix - and found it easy to listen to rather than the traditional music that we normally have at this time of year
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Outstanding story, outstanding acting, suspenseful.  Can definitely see why awards were given to this program. Well worth the cost.  Looking forward to Season 2 availability.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|for those west wing fans who just can not get enough, this is the perfect gift. It really shows how the government works
B00355L2TU|5.0|This workout video will be sure to help you achieve your goals. I've lost 2.4lbs since I started and haven't even been doing it for a week.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|How can you not love disney movies. I thought my grandaughter would love this because she is such a cat fan. She did love it. It was great I didn't have to go to the store to do my shopping.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is hysterically funny. A definite must see if you love music and humor.<br />A girl, Becca, joins an A Capella group and completely redefines the way the group performs.<br />I won't tell you too much of the details of the movie so as not to spoil it, but just trust me when I say this is a must see fun for the family movie.<br />5 out if 5 stars
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|way stupid for anyone with any sense of humor very basic tripe tired plot and inane writing do not waste your time unless you are under 14 and need to learn gutter
B000FC1AGG|5.0|One of the most fun-filled books I've read this year.  I laughed out loud throughout the entire book.  The characters were wonderfully developed.  Sophie Kinsella is a winner!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put the book down. It keeps you on your toes with, what will happen next.?  Cant wait to read the next 2 books.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I have read many of the Nicholas Sparks' books and have really liked them.  The Lucky One was a bit slow in the beginning, but proved to be worth my time.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Daughter is 3 and she wants to be a Dr. so we bought her this game to make animals feel all better.. its one of the first games she plays when she picks up her Nabi
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing.  I couldn't put it down.  I stayed up all night finishing this book and cried throughout the ending.  The death o f so many who are important an  the love between two kept me going.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Good book I'm ready for the movies to come out. Although the books are always better than the movies tb
B000YHG72E|5.0|I watched this probably 3 times this past holiday season.  It never gets old and is the perfect addition to my holiday movie collection.
B000YHG72E|5.0|We watched this with our 10-year-old and she loved it! It was very sweet and silly. A perfect holiday movie for the family to enjoy together.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game for how simple it is can get you playing as much as possible. Also it is my all time favorite fair game, so it brings back memories.
0525478817|5.0|By turns moving and hilarious, John Green's novel is an instant classic. His prose is economical and descriptions are never terribly detailed but simultaneously it allows for stunning growth of the characters and an engrossing involvement of the reader. The story moves at a excellent pace that doesn't leave you breathless but instead leads you on comfortably.<br /><br />The characters can be a bit hipster at times for my taste but beyond all of the phrases like &#34;my lungs suck at being lungs&#34;, meant to make it painfully clear just how quirky and awesomely hip the characters are, lie very likeable and relateable characters that feel like your close friends by the end of the book. Indeed the characters become fully realized people with whom you empathize and about whom you truly care.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough. And at the Amazon price you can't beat the deal!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is amazing it adds so much more than any other bloons before plus it adds way more to do with special missions and random missions.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Great movie for the entire family to watch. Will watch this movie several times during Christmas season, each and every yr!!
B000002H97|5.0|Excellent!!! Quick shipment....played the CD over and over again. My husband loves it.....he requested this CD as my Christmas gift to him.
B000T45C32|4.0|Although this movie was written several years ago its depictiojn of a possible future doesn't come across as 'dated'.<br />This was an entertaining video, well acted and at times subtle. We enjoyed watching it.
B0099TJ4YQ|3.0|I had hoped there was new material on this cd--it is very similar to his older cd, so it was duplicated quite a bit.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Came very fast. One of the best wild and wacky movies ever made. Each of us has our own favorite scenes of chaos or disorder.
B003DTMUOE|3.0|Tal vez escuche tanto hablar de esta novela que esperaba algo distinto.  Sera porque ya alcance mis suenos?  Bueno... Todavia me quedan algunos mas.<br />Gracias!<br />Damaris
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought two copies - one for my daughter, one for my niece. They can't get enough of these boys. And what a wonderful price!!! There is nowhere else people should get these except Amazon!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I live in an area where finding a good radio station is somewhat of a chore. This product works very well and is very easy to use.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Came fast, safe, and my children watched it several times. They love it. I was surprised, but not unhappy - it's a great movie I saw many moons ago, and thought it was a bit &#34;heady&#34; for them...that only I would like it. Someone should be promoting it to high school kids across the country - definitely worth owning!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This is the Facebook app for the Amazon Kindle HD. It works but lacks many of the functions of the same app on my PC. It's OK for the road but not a satisfying experience. I wish they'd start over and fix it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Such an active plot. A must read and may be the best in the series.
B009VB97EY|5.0|This movie was in great condition when I received it and really enjoyed watching the movie. Channung Tatum is so hot and this was an awesome way of showing him off.
B005OV0PS2|5.0|Hands down one of the funniest movies of my lifetime. I was exposed to this movie years after it completely BOMBED in the theater. I honestly had no interest in seeing this movie until I heard other people referring to lines from this movie in normal conversation. I thought to myself &#34;there has to be something about this movie, everyone is always talking about it.&#34;<br /><br />Its FUNNY! It actually gets funnier as you watch it for the 4th or 5th time. John Goodman is hysterical.<br /><br />&#34;I got friends that died face down in the muck!&#34;<br /><br />One of the funniest parts in this movie is when the Dude goes to Jackie Treehorn's house. He overhears a private conversation Jackie is having on the phone. Jackie is taking notes on the call and then excuses himself from the room. The Dude runs over to the pad and uses a pencil to outline the notes from Jackie's secret call, but it turns out he only doodled a cartoon of a naked guy with a huge..... well you get the point. The dude is constantly let down yet everything always works out for him. He comes up with these great ideas but they all turn out to be stupid, yet everyone looks up to him like he's Jesus reincarnated.<br /><br />His car starts off as a piece of junk and somehow or another gets worse and worse through the entire film. HAHA!<br /><br />You will laugh at the whole movie, be quoting movie scenes, and wonder if the Dude is a complete moron or the smartest guy on the planet. The dude hears quotes and fancy language from other people throughout the movie then tries to use them in his own context but they never come out right.<br /><br />Ok, I'm done selling this movie. Just buy it already.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was half and half but but some of the games are hard smd dumb you have to stop oil like o would do that
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time<br />Could almost be better then sparks  love love love
B002ZG97EC|5.0|One of my kids' favorite movies.  The 3-disc version is great - Blu-Ray at home, DVD for the car, and the digital version for the handheld device.  As a bonus, it's a movie I don't mind, either.  We're looking forward to DM2 coming out soon!
0307951529|2.0|I can see why this book got a lot of positive reviews. I think its great for mainstream reader who just wants to get inspired to launch a business. However for anyone who is serious about starting a business and making it a full time job I really doubt this book will be helpful. None of the people in the book seem to struggle much. They decided to make money, created a website or opened a coffee shop on $100 and the money started to pour in. It's never that easy, but this book never mentions this. I know many photographers, small time publishers, web designers and other creatives who have websites, newsletters and other resources that author writes about, but unlike people mentioned in the book they struggle on a daily basis and have multiple jobs to support their efforts. I think this is book is superficial and only aims to inspire readers without giving them real substance or showing how much struggle it takes to launch a business. Don't quit your day job after reading this book. Success doesn't happen over night, unfortunately that's not the message that's being presented to the reader.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this book with an open mind, however, from a Christian perspective. I was completely captivated and zoomed through it just to gather as much information as quickly as possible. And too, I found it hard to put down.  I am now reading it again to savor and contemplate all the book has to offer. I rarely read books on Near Death Experiences but find the idea fascinating. I was not disappointed with Eben Alexander's &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;. I applaud him for his courage in making his experience public. Not only for the general public but for the medical professionals. These professions are so stressful and hectic,(not to mention, all the scientific education they ingest on a daily basis) that I am sure taking pause to ponder another life other than what is before them, often just doesn't happen. Just because life gets in the way of pausing and pondering, does not make it any less important. I believe Eben Alexander brings to the forefront the importance of seeing beyond this life to what many believe, unfortunately, to be unseeable!
B003O86FMW|5.0|5 stars... enjoyed the book very much. I am anxious to begin the next book in the trilogy!! Suzanne Collins is quite talented.
0545265355|5.0|These are a beautifully boxed set of the Hunger Games trilogy.  My daughter was very excited and I thought the quality was great!
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Enjoying this collection. Would recommend to other readers. Is a great gift for all Sherlock Holmes lovers. A must read.
0553801503|1.0|It was not clear when I purchased this that is was from a different publishing date and does not match the other books I have in the series.  I will be returning this book.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Still reading but I look forward to picking it up each time. Lots of action and surprises. I am a big fan of these authors and Two Grave does not disappoint.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Good clean and fun movie for my family to watch and enjoy for a long time to come at home
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My baby sister and I read these together and I love it!  This was a nice spinoff book from the original series and I have to say, that is rare.  Can't wait for the series to continue (Currently on book 3 and still loving it!)
B003O86FMW|2.0|This is not as good as the first one. We need a little more action in the beginning of the book
B008VBYN80|4.0|its a cute and entertaining game. not bad at all to keep you busy to past the time. wish I can time more like this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is such a great app. I use it everyday. It keeps all of my interests well organized and allows me to share with friends. This is an app I would pay for, thankfully it is free!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|For adult eyes only though. :) Loved the books. The second book was my favorite, but they were all splendid.. Will definitely read them again.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a fun game and worth the little money it costs. Great graphics and images. My kindle crashed halfway through and I had to restart the game. It was just as challenging the second time as it was the first. Lots of fun!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was my favorite of all three books! I read the first one through the library, but once I got started I couldn't stop.  Well worth the price and I love to get Kindle books right on my phone!
0385474547|4.0|I must admit, it has been 12 years since I have read this book, so I do not remember everything. However, this was one of the only books I read in high school that I truly enjoyed. I felt compelled to write a review because when I found out I had to read this book, I was dreading it, but I ended up being engrossed with the anthropology of the tale. I just bought the book again and I hope it is as good as I remember.
1603429999|5.0|Was easy to understand. I have taught myself to knit. I had not tried the circular needles so I wanted to have some instructions on it befor giving it a try.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is such a wonderfully written story I assumed was just a young love story. Not true.  This story was heartbreaking.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Interesting, different, a welcome addition to my eclectic collection.<br />Not for everyone, I suppose, but right up my alley. At least give a listen to the clips.
0920668372|5.0|got it for my girl friend for Christmas and it came right on time. was happy with the packaging also.
044651506X|5.0|Nelson DeMille gives us PLUM ISLAND, book one in his John Corey series.  This is my second DeMille book and I am hooked, ready to wade through them all.  John Corey is a NYPD homicide who is recovering from severe gunshot wounds in little Southold, on Long Island.  Local chief Maxwell seeks his help in a double homicide case(they seldom deal with homicide).  Corey accepts and is drawn into a super case.  The deaths are two researchers at the federal Plum Island Research Station therefore bringing not only Southold PD and Suffolk County Police but the FBI, CIA and loads of very dangerous research.  Throw in history and pirate treasure, two hot ladies and a violent weather event all with the sharp tongued and funnny Corey and you have a great first book for the series.  Bring on book two.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|This app is not very good .because when you set your alarm clock to a song or sound it does static and it hurts your ears!
B005VPRET4|5.0|Again thanks for fulling your comittment to send the order in time for Christmas. You made a little girl very happy! THanks!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Fast action and well written.  Lee Child definitely will get another look from me.  Jack Reacher is one you want on your side.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Pretty much the best Glu game on the market and you can earn credits too! The only downside is the controls are kind of weird, but other than that great job Glu.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The read was exciting<br />IT kept me interested to the end.<br />Ready to read the next book.<br />Holding all is well back at district 12
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of of the best books I have ever read and is the kind you won't want to put down at all!!
1469984202|5.0|I loathe the cookie-cutter stories that are repeated over and over. I found this series to be unique, surprising and refreshing from all the other garbage that is out there. I was drawn in from the beginning.  I loved the unique way the story twisted and turned. Highly recommended.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|The only thin  I had trouble with us the language  and vocabulary. Other than that it's a very  good Christmas story
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|As usual Streep great acting, good cinamatography, and great script as we alll live longer and some relationships last 50 plus years or so exceed past experiences.<br />And while financial planning is concered about retirement funds have to last longer than in the past, so too do attachments.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved the book!! Nicholas Sparks is my favorite and has an amazing talent!! His books are so touching and from the heart!!
B00AKCJB44|4.0|It was nice to get the music (the title theme &#34;Django&#34; and &#34;100 Black Coffins&#34; two stand outs) but even nicer to get the extra dialogue that was not in the movie. You can't go wrong when you buy a Quentin Tarantino soundtrack. The only other director who I buy their soundtracks before even listening to them or watching the movie is Wes Anderson.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I like this book because you can find the word you are looking for when you are looking for it in this book.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Based on the other reviews I thought this would no be good. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I actually learned more about the movie series by watching this. I found it very entertaining.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Following the last two books by John Grisham I had lowered my expectation but with the Racketeer John is back and I believe it's one of the best books he has written in years.
B000000W5L|4.0|Altho the music is old, it's still good, especially &#34;Tumblilng Dice&#34; and &#34;Happy&#34;.  I am so glad I bought it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Helps dads remember what is truly important.  While not the finest by hollywood production standards, it hits hard at core values of honesty and the importance of being a dad.  Watch it with your wife and kids.  You won't regret it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun and ADDICTING!  I like how there are lots of ways to get extra points.  lie it
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is one of my favorite games thus far and I have played about 30 of them.  My tip for new players is check your map often to see what areas you need to go to and perform some action (hidden object scene or key that unlocks something), which is much easier than wondering around through all scenes.  Absolutely wonderful game!  I'm also a big fan of all Alawar Games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game for all ages. In my opinion it is better then any running game I have ever played.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read this book for one of my book clubs and had not even heard about it before.  We ALL loved the book.  It is such a sweet, yet heartbreaking book and so wonderfully told.  I will read it again soon.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a good application for android to replace the calculator that comes with an android phone. I enjoyed being able to see my previous data input. This feature alone would make me download it again. The app shows you beneath the screen what your calculation inputs have been thus far. By seeing this on the screen; if my total does not come out to what I estimated, I am able to see what calculations I typed in. This is an added bonus for productivity as it allows me to reduce the steps of having to redo the entire calculation. I can clearly see the values I have put in so I can see my mistake instantly.<br /><br />Great app - a definite must to any productivity app that would be used everyday.<br /><br />Regards,<br />~ Holley Jacobs
0345525558|3.0|I did not like this book at all.  Found it hard to believe. While it did give me slight insight into foster care, the main character is unappealing and I found it hard to believe anyone could care about her.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|My first kindle fire got broken because of problems with the USB port for charging but Amazon customer services gave me a replacement. I had no problems with transferring my data to my 2nd kindle because of Cloud. I am very satisfied with how Amazon handled my problem.
037582913X|5.0|My own children loved this book, and I'm so happy it's available for my grandchildren.  Terrific book, delights the children.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This was okay as an action movie. The first one was better. Too much Arnold not enough Li and Statham.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|It would be hard for me to believe that 20 years have passed since the RATM's first album came out, but it's true, and this masterpiece came out again as such a great edition. Two cds, one with full album + 3 live songs, and the other one with demo recordings, plus two dvds with all video works + a huge free concert that happened in London (and of course a 180gram vinyl that's cherry on top of the cake), are contained in this edition. Of course, there is a photo book and a big poster, all wrapped in a nice box. I have been a fan since Rage Against the Machine started, and this edition has been a jewel in the crown.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Bought for my husband....it was PERFECT! He enjoys listening to it both in the car and at home.  If you're a Bond fan you will love it too.  Shipped promptly and in GREAT condition.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Was a wonderful story. A page turner for sure did not want the book to end. Recommend to anybody that likes a good romance.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|The Lost City is a great game, but the ending leaves a bit to be desired. Finishing the last puzzle (which isn't much to speak of anyway) simply brings you to a few vague sentences that weakly conclude the game. Well worth the 99 cents though.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It is not bad......the story is very weak. It's a sexy book to read and that's it, nothing more nothing less!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|best app I've ever had! :) I wouldn't have gotten if it wasn't free app of the day, it's a lot of fun.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great and useful app.  One key improvement would be for the syncing function.  When I update my notes on one or more of my 3 devices, there are often conflict versions created and content is sometimes lost.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|My 7 year old daughter had this book read to her in school and requested me to buy it. I'm glad I did because of course she still loved it.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|I saw this many years ago, and recently rented it again. I enjoy the subtleties of this movie in addition to the music. Glen Hansard is an amazingly talented performer.
B004JM8X5E|5.0|This movie shows love and compassion as well as the need for acceptance of people with different gifts. A must see!!!
1933308087|5.0|I am a quilter and am always looking for different ideas and this offers fantastic blocks and explains the grids for the quilts and the color options are endless.  There are also diretions for some of Jinny's outstanding designs.  An excellent resource for any quilter.
B004GYY714|5.0|Wow - what a great app. You can search by locations by starting in countries, and narrowing the AM and FM list by city. Usually I just see 'FM' station apps, but this has the 'AM' ones also. You can even save a list of your favorites. Way too easy. Go ahead, try it!
1449410243|1.0|I ordered this book for my cat loving mother-in-law. Thank goodness I put my address not hers for the mailing! The attempt at humour is disappointingly crude with most of the book devoted to several boring sections of something called 'The Bobcats', a large section on whether your cat is gay and much of the rest devoted to peeing pooing and vomiting cats. A few pages of almost redeeming humour save it from oblivion and a generous half star is all it deserves. Don't waste your money or precious minutes of your life by reading this sad and sorry book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was fun but much too short. I guess you have to buy it to play longer. It's too bad because I enjoyed it.
0670023329|5.0|A book I could not put down! It usually takes me a month to read a book. I read this in two days.
B0089IGUP4|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift when it was on sale early in the season. The price was right and my daughter was thrilled. The CD itself is very good, continuing their string of catchy rock albums that are both lyrically and musically engaging.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like this app but the free version does not come with as many features as the description let's on.
B005LAII80|4.0|I hadn't even heard of Dredd before its release date, but the sheer volume of positive critical reviews convinced me to turn over my silver at the local cineplex.  With first run tickets costing $12, I'm less inclined to take a leap of faith these days, but in the case of Dredd, I'm glad I did.  If I had waited to talk with someone who had seen the flick, I would have been out of luck, as it seems only a couple dozen other US movie goers caught this dazzling left field ball before it faded at the box office.  I agree with other reviewers who feel it's a shame and a mystery this film failed to attract an audience.<br /><br />I won't summarize the plot - others have already done so aptly and with more details than I can recall from one viewing.  Suffice it to say Karl Urban is the re-personification of the Man with No Bane + Dirty Harry, transported to another dystopian future with just enough cinematic novelty to push Dredd past the now all-too-common usual post-apocalyptic suspects.  Urban seems to have won over the Dredd diehards who were still smarting over Stallone's jokey star turn from 1995.  I can't comment, as I am unfamiliar with the source material, however, Urban perfectly channels Eastwood, circa 1966/71, with his laconic, ironic performance.<br /><br />One of the pleasures of watching this admittedly hyper-violent action flick, is the growing realization that Urban's Dredd is so bad ass, no matter what the increasingly impossible odds, nothing is going to stop him from attaining the ridiculous ante he ups, even when it seems he has no choice but toto fold.  Like the Eastwood personas, you root as much for the IDEA of a super-heroic unstoppable force plowing through a familiar landscape of evil-doers - baddies who might otherwise singe the feet of John McClane or even Schwarzenegger on a good day.  The fun comes from watching the bad guys (gal) coming to grips with the fact they are simply not facing an ordinary mortal, although Dredd isn't Superman taking down a bicycle thief; he's flesh and bloody-well bleeds.  His super power lies in the fact he's just more cold than the villains.<br /><br />It's the almost Tarantino/Sam Jackson attitude that Urban evokes - you don't question how, you just laugh and root him on.  The fact that Urban plays it totally straight, yet not RoboCop-ish, is key.  Granted, obscuring his face with a helmet for the entire movie helps to discourage any sly eye-brow arching and the script doesn't give Dredd much wiggle room in the character development department.  Though Eastwood never wore a mask, the comparison is still compatible - no offense Clint, but who needed, who WANTED expressive range when Harry Callahan was doggedly pursuing Scorpio through a hail of gunfire in that rock quarry?  A man's got to know his limitations indeed!<br /><br />The rest of the Dredd cast does a serviceable job and the effects, as noted, are on the Spartan side, however the filmmakers make up for a lack of budget, similar to Looper, with enough imagination to keep the largely CGI-scenery fresh.  I'm looking forward to buying Dredd on Blu-ray and recommend it to anyone who enjoys loud, smart, escapist fun.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I've been living without tv for 3 years. I will pay to watch this show! This is the best tv show I've seen in a long time. I love that this is NOT a movie. I can not predict the outcome. The cinematography feels so intimate. I love the darkness, the innocence, the sex...the characters are so well written and the actors are intense! LOVE IT!!
B00999DFP0|5.0|Awesome condition, great price. I love this show, season 5 was so much better and funnier then the rest, cant wait to see what season 6 brings
B009CG3M1C|5.0|Not very realistic but very entertaining.  My husband is in the Navy so he just likes to sit and tell us everything that is on the ships.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Enjoyed the narrative style and fell in love with Charlie. To paraphrase the main character, this is a good book because I do indeed feel differently after reading it.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|It is, however, entirely possible that they will not.  In fact, the whole serial killer thing is pretty unlikely, statistically speaking.  But owning this movie certainly cannot hurt your chances of raising a healthy, normal child to adulthood.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Makes ordering from Amazon much more streamlined. The time and effort that it takes to complete an order is so much better for the user.
0761169431|5.0|First words out of my nephew's mouth were, &#34;Two of my favorite things,&#34; in a hilariously matter of fact tone.  He looked amazed that such a thing even existed.  I gather the Death Star is coming along nicely as I type this.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|tomandlorenzo.com did a fashion breakdown for every episode of this season, it really added to the viewing experience. great season, definitely recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love love love! This book was great so far all her books are amazing. 100% recommended. I'm read it again
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was a quick and easy read.....I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and now I cannot wait to see the movie!
B009K0P10K|4.0|Great series. I was wondering how season 2 would measure up. But great so far! Cheap rental from amazon. We got the whole series.
B007SGM084|2.0|Purchased without reading the sample.  Not my forte.  I was disappointed.  I will read sample from now on.  A little too much for me since I am celibate.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Everything here is wonderful, but I wish it had Lovely Ladies, Do You Hear The People Sing?, and didn't cut parts of At The End Of The Day (also, A Little Fall of Rain is missing, but I didn't love that song).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was sensual yet composed and loving the storyline. It was tough to put down once you began to read.
0736063684|5.0|This book is a truly unmatched guide to what workouts effect what muscles. I have had this book for about 4 years and I keep it with me every time I work out. Not only are the drawings clear and self-explanatory, but there is a good variety of weight lifting workouts to choose from. This book is a must have for any level from beginner to personal trainer.
B00942S4OY|4.0|My twelve year old daughter is completely enamored with this band. I gave her this cd as a gift and she was ecstatic!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have to start by saying that this is the first book review I have ever written, I have never felt compelled to write one before now. I first started reading the sample of this book while on my lunch break, I never should have done that. I couldn't wait for the day to be over to continue reading. Ms Hoover is a very talented writer. The characters are so compelling, they just draw you in. I look forward to reading more of Ms Hoover's books. If you read this book you will not be sorry.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|The Bourne creators had a strong trilogy. It wasn't Lord of the Rings, but they had crafted a nicely-woven narrative that finishes the way it begins. Why not exit the stage and leave it alone? Money.<br /><br />First off, the storyline makes no sense. And once you've thought carefully about the plot, you're left wondering why you should care at all. After watching this movie twice, I still can't figure that out.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it for anyone considering buying the movie -- but it is a sexed-up story of someone trying to get their medication. With satellites, drones and assassins mixed in.<br /><br />If this movie is playing on an airplane, sure, watch it. If the neighborhood mega-store is handing out free copies, sure, take it. (And regift to someone who doesn't mind illogical action.) But don't spend money on this.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|its basic and does what its supposed to do. Its not going to get you surgical sharp, but it will get you acceptable in a hurry.
B003ZTQN1I|1.0|Country Strong:  Original Motion Picture<br /><br />This is not the original music from the movie.  The actors in the film did their own singing in the motion picture, but this has other artists singing songs from the movie.  I am very disappointed.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|You can never go wrong with plex on whatever device you need to stream media to.  The cost is a bit high for apps, but the quality is there. and the updates are frequent.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I liked Lady Gaga's other music so I thought I would enjoy this album as well but it was not my cup of tea at all.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|I like the cover, however, there is no place to put the stylus.  also if put in the case correctly with the camera on top, then the openings are covered for charging/earphones, if you turn it around, then it won't stand on the stand correctly.  It's okay, but they could have made it better by making the stand part more versatile and putting in a pocket or something to hold the stylus.
B000059H98|5.0|This is my favourite movie of all time and I'm glad I finally got to buy it on DVD! It was shipped fast and in great condition! I would recommend this movie to anyone, male or female, who likes hardcore but funny chicks.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|love it! This is the best version yet of the angry birds series - watch out though - it is addicting!
0393327345|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk is one of the greatest writers. I am a huge fan of the movie and I am so glad I decided to read the book. I strongly recommend this book to EVERYONE.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Now off to reading Mockingjay.  I may even reread this later, who knows. I give this 4.5/5 :)
0307711773|5.0|Riordan, is able to give new life to the mythology of Rome in these delightful stories written in a modern day setting. The books make you want to learn about and review mythology from your High School days.<br /><br />Well done.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|I love all of Michael Jacksons music, got this to add to my collection. came as it was described. would recommend
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a great game easy to follow and clues were pretty easy to discover.  story line was decent and interesting .
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this for my Dad's Kindle Fire and he loves it.<br />It fits the Fire like a glove, looks sleek, feels like a quality product, and being able to prop it up surely comes in handy in some situations.
B0045HCJRG|4.0|Like the story and how it plays out. A funny story regarding time, past to current. Recommended for all ages to watch.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. A wonderful story with delightful characters. Good for a weekend read when the weather is poor.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Love the special effects and sounds in all the movies. The interaction between man and machine in how it is presented and acted out makes it a hit. Love all the stories in this trilogy. The characters/cast is great. After you had seen the first movie you want to see more. Michael Mann had a great vision with this series. .
B0057R5XRG|5.0|The reason I love Blu-Ray. The sound is great on this trilogy and I was impressed with picture also. Good to have in the collection.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Great classic movie for the holidays! I would recommend this movie highly. By far one of the best Christmas story of all time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I purchased this to play anytime.  I am quite hooked on any solitaire game. This one is challenging enough for me.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|Great movie if you like cars, car chases and action. I recommend this movie for adults. I love the interaction with all the characters between family and friends. Cast in movie are great! Keeps you interested throughout the whole movie.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a fun pastime while waiting in line, etc. I also got it for my grandkids to play while waiting.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Wished there were more songs on the DVD but oh well, you can't have everything.  The ones here are great!<br />Joe Walsh is a great artist and quite funny...<br /><br />Wonderful hit with my husband for Christmas!
B007RTAR64|4.0|My daughter loves it. Very good likeness. Very worth the money. Arrived quickly.  Packaged nicely.  Too bad there is not a peeta or gale doll.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Real good I hope the guy doesn't get in trouble for writing it. I'm sure his name has probably gotten out
B0095R76EW|2.0|Wouldn't have finished watching the movie if I hadn't paid for it. Thought it was supposed to be funny but it was a downer.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|this game is really fun ( level one is really hard though ) this game is just really challenging and you really have to think hard. : )
B006CQLGXG|5.0|It has been a family tradition for generations to read this story aloud in the days leading up to Christmas, and no one ever ties of it! This classic by Dickens tells better than any other story I know the true meaning of Christmas. \\"And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless us, every one!\\"
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is such a delightfull, clever book. I raced through it from beginning to end. Lauching out loud, bewonderd and thrilled. the historic aspect is superb. A must read!!
B007V5CF5K|3.0|The puzzles are a lot of fun. They do make you think to solve them...not too easy not too hard. The game has crashed and restarted atleastthreetimes whe playing.  It immediately goes back to the game main menu and keeps my progress.  kind of annoying...
B0014D6PCO|2.0|Movie was great! The Amazon streaming was horrible. Several times the movie would stop to buffer but wouldn't restart on it's own. Several times we had back up and and restart the movie. Picture quality was good but streaming compared to NetFlix, Hulu etc. Amazon has a long ways to go before I'll buy another movie through your system.
B000I3P3EM|4.0|The movie was good, however not as good as the original season.  I can only now look forward to the current movies, and hope for cameo appearances.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|Nice contemporary Xmas movie for kids.  Will become and annual viewing I am sure. Kids loved it especially in Blu-ray 3D.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It couldn't have been done much better.  I wish that they didn't cliffhang us until February, however.  The drama, and the acting are always great.  I can't get enough!
B00000JCB2|5.0|Had this cd before but it was another that I unfortunately lost in a move. Snatched this up on here for a great deal :)
B000002KXV|4.0|I don't like it when people go solo. I skipped this 30 years ago. It doesn't blow me away, but I am happy to have it in my collection now.
0545265355|5.0|I hadn't yet read the books but kept hearing such great things and knew I had to had have! I found this great deal on the trilogy set and bought them. I quickly read all three in a few weeks and absolutely loved them!! :)  I'd recommend them to anyone!
B0030V0PEW|5.0|As a software developer it is hard to have a fixed checklist for every time I'm coding. But this book gives you a new perpective about checklists and motivation to apply it. I'm now working in ways to use a checklist for important but repetitive actions.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|I found this almost unreadable.  I kept trying but gave up half way through.  Characters uninteresting and no intrigue with the storyline.  I was hoping it would be a story that would transport me to another time and place, and give me insight into something new and a different era.  I could not get there.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The story had great potential to become a really funny movie. But it seemed raunchy language and juvenile gestures  dominated the dialogue and actions.
B009O07NDY|5.0|El producto es maravilloso, las canciones son hermosas, un gran producto acompañado de hermosos gráficos y extras, estoy bastante complacido.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I saw this movie the second day it was out and I had no pre-conceived notions about him playing this character. I am not a die-hard Tom Cruise fan and he has done enough movies that suck that they could go either way. This movie was well done and he did a fantastic job. Who cares if he is not 6'5\\". He plays it big and pulls it off. I would say get to the theater and watch this movie. It does not seem like a 2 plus hour movie. It moves along well and it was rather refreshing that he played the character as confident not some angsty whiner. I am tired of that whole line of thinking in movies music and whatever else you can think of. So get out there and watch it even if Tom Cruise isn't your favorite this one does not disappoint.
B009CG25JM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all times. Hot cars, hot women, and set in a time where the american dream seemed obtainable. Watching this movie makes we wish I had grown up during that period instead of being a by product of the time. It is such a fun movie to watch I can watch it over and over. I recommend it to everyone. On a kindle fire hd it looks fantastic.
1469984202|5.0|I keep a book blog at joshsbookemporium.blogspot.com.  WOOL IS AMAZING!  If you have not read it, then your life is less interesting.  Apocalyptic fiction at its best.  The writing is spot on, and the characters are sympathetic and tragic.  Bravo, Mr. Howey!
B002KVCA1O|5.0|Grew up listening to The Rolling Stones and various artists like them. This is a good compilation of their music and sounds great on my new kindle fire hd. If you like this type of music I recommend this album. Everyone should download some music they enjoy and then jam a little for a better life.
B0090X4GLW|3.0|It's a good Soundtrack, but in the special features of the movie, there is a music video of the cast singing Starships, and it is fantastic...so disappointing!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|This is music  i listened to growing up. Phil Collins performs with groups and by himself throughout his career. I think you get some of best of Phil Collins with this album. I really enjoy it and it sounds great on my kindle fire hd. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Phil Collins.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I download this game to almost every device I touch lol if only it was available on blackberry. I got the whole family hooked!
B003JRD5JO|5.0|I grew up listening to this type of music and still love it today. It brings back fond memories and  sounds good on my new Kindle. If you like this type of music get a portable device , download music from amazon and enjoy.I recommend everyone do this and enjoy life.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed The Secret Keeper very much. It was like a movie in words. Kate Morton is a very creative writer.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is my wife's game on MY Kindle Fire. She LOVES this one & plays it so much I have a hard time using my own Kindle! LOL!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed the Racketeer very much. It was very well thought out and I appreciated the ending very much. It is one of the best books by John Grisham.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|This is like many pinball games but the constant adds during your game can get a little annoying. Graphics look good and the sounds keep you going through the game.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  The type of movie you want to watch every Christmas Season.  Bought some for friends so they could enjoy too.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Very juvenile and pointless movie. We wasted $2.99 on it. I can't understand how stars like Mila Kunis and Mark Wahlberg can make such idiotic movies?! Please avoid watching!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|For all video game lovers this book is incredible, I can't even begin to describe it here. Go read it!!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I like all kinds of music and the Twilight sound tracks never fail to include all types of music.  Great job.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is a quick read! The end was satisfying but quickly wrapped. HAD to knowing what happens, so while I am happy for having read it, the end of this finely written trilogy comes too soon. Collins takes her time in the first two books to jam the third with a hasty ending. Not disappointed as others had indicated but was left feeling like she got half way through writing it and found something better to do.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|The ink is really faint, and the cap doesn't come off very easily, I lost one of the small parts in a matter of minutes. Awesome looking, and a real conversation piece.
B009NCM248|4.0|don't miss out on this one great tunes turn it up !!<br />best gift i bought my self all year
0930289234|5.0|I never read a comic book or graphic novel before this one.  I probably should have because I imagine it might be all downhill after this incredible, amazing masterpiece of fiction.  This book was stunning in every way I can think of.<br /><br />I never would have thought I'd read something like this (comics never really interested me), but I saw the very end of the movie and I thought it sounded cool.  So, many months later, I asked for the book for Xmas.  And it completely blew me away.<br /><br />This book has everything: an intriguing mystery/whodunnit; incredible imagery; fabulous dialogue; well developed characters; highly detailed backdrop; psychological depth.  I could not put the freaking thing down!  This entire work should be required reading for anyone attempting to write any sort of engrossing, page-turning, mind-blowing fiction.<br /><br />I found myself at times just looking at the images ... there is so much detail.  Sometimes when something important would happen in a panel, I'd look a few panels back, and there are people or things in the backgrounds of previous panels that I hadn't noticed before which foreshadow the important event.<br /><br />Another thing I liked is that this book blows away any preconceived notions of goodguy/badguy one may have.  In Watchmen, the good guys aren't all that good, and the bad guys aren't all that bad (sort of).  Also, the \\"superheroes\\" frankly aren't all that super (except for two).  I think all of that was the point of the book -- to portray heroes as real people, with all the good AND the bad baggage a normal person would carry with them.  It makes it so much more real to me.  I loved that about it.<br /><br />Because a good bit of the story arc deals with Cold War issues, people born after about 1984 might find it a little less enjoyable than those of us who remember the international politics of the time and what it was like having a nuclear arch-nemesis.<br /><br />One warning: The book has sexy scenes, brief nudity, and lots and lots of blood, death and violence.  Keep that in mind if you are considering this book as a gift for a minor.<br /><br />To sum up: not just a good book, not just a great book ... it's a book that will blow you away.  AMAZING.
B005LAII9O|4.0|I didn't come into seeing this film with great expectations. That is generally a good place for me to start. I wasn't terribly familiar with the three main stars but liked all the ancillary actors. Another good place for me. The movie was acted well,  directed well, stayed true to the source material from Don Winslow as much as  possible.  There was some of the Oliver Stone style that made too much for some people. But overall excellent film that touches on friendship love the \\"drug war\\"
B009ZE27US|1.0|My wife downloaded this on a whim. It was deleted within 10 minutes of download. I'm unsure why this app or one's like it even exist. This app has almost zero entertainment value; almost zero because I'm generously including the ~10 sec of laughter that my wife and I shared over just how stupid this app was because I went from being 18, then 45, then 70...
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Not a movie to watch unless you can give it your full attention. But this movie was a big eye opener! Must see!!!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|The mighty rearranger has made Zeppelin alive again, every bit as exciting as way back when giants used to walk this earth. The spirit of the band is just there... untouched. Jimmy, John Paul and Robert are just supreme.<br /><br />And Jason Bonham... WOW! He must be so proud of how things turned out and so must John, his son really went for it and was truly a hero. To overcome all that pressure and expectation must've been insane.<br /><br />Also, I thought the bonus DVD with the rehearsal prior to the concert was UNBELIEVABLE!!! Although just a one-camera film, the quality of the performance is mind-blowing to say the least. They seem more at ease - for obvious reasons - and the music just soars. It's amazing how they managed to be really into it. Watching the rehearsal made me think of how great Zeppelin always was when it came to playing live, the next concert was always a new musical challenge, full of new improvisations and adventures. Priceless.<br /><br />While it's sort of odd to have Zeppelin music recorded in 2007, it does feel like an interesting new epilogue to a legacy that's far from dying down. Zeppelin's swan song has been sung in only very seldom occasions, each threatening to be the very last one. Will there be more to come? It doesn't look like it, but never say never...<br /><br />Never in history has one single concert ignited such flame, too many magical moments to mention...<br /><br />\\"Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, across the sea of years<br />With no provision but an open face, along the straits of fear.\\"
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I was surprised to see this has a total run time similar to many other Pixar movies because this one accomplishes very little in that span. The narrative is very focused on the mother-daughter relationship, but the lessons are trite and it seems to focus on those characters to the exclusion of any other developed character. Aside from the father, it seems like every other character is relegated to a mere cameo.
B000SGRONM|2.0|Snarky and not all that humorous.  More cruel than insightful.  I may try and read something else by him later but only if it is free
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter loves this product. I am very pleased with how quickly it arrived after we purchased it for Christmas.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom has done it again. I love the characters in the novel.  Having followed the series since the first have come to feel &#34; I know these guys&#34;. All novels should be of , at least,  this intense.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My daughter loves this product. I am very pleased with how quickly it arrived after we purchased it for Christmas .
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Being married to a South Korean, I found this book very informative. What surprised me is now that I know what is going on, why does the world not put an end to this outrage.
B005LAIISA|5.0|My daughter loves this product. I am very pleased with how quickly it arrived after we purchased it for Christmas.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app was exactly what I wanted and it did exactly what the app said it would do.  Nice features.
B00846TRHY|3.0|I hear this is a great movie. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I wasn't able to watch it in the two days I I rented it..
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I haven't finished the game or even gotten close, but I enjoy it immensely every time I have free time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Dark. Powerful. Couldnt put it down! I stayed up late at night to finished it. Loved it! Would recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was a book that had love, hope, and sorrow. And in the end you would never have guessed what you thought was true. It shows you that even if you have had or still have a hard life, you can always overcome it with the help of the people you love the most. Great Book, I think this book will grab those readers out there that love a good young love/moving book that will leave you wanting to finish it the moment you open the book and read the first line.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|There's a lot of junk on the market for tablets, but this product is not in the junkpile. It's straightforward-easy to use, does what it says it will do, and is just as versatile as many of its competitors I considered. Anybody can use this item, so why pay more?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I LOVE DAIRY OF A WIMPY KID!BEST BOOK EVER!I WOULD BUY IT! WORTH THE MONEY! IF YOU LIKE TEENS BUY!
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|Great compilation of Mayer's work.  Would recommend to any John Mayer fan or guitar enthusiast that likes to play along.

B007N8RULO|3.0|Love the game but not the ads every time you start a new game!<br />It is a fun version of a classic game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! it's completely addicting passes time in lines and waiting on the kids! LOVE IT!!! I have it on my phone and my kindle!

B008476HBM|5.0|No matter how many times I read this book, it still makes me smile.  An American classic beyond measure!  It will forever withstand the test of time!
1469220660|5.0|This is definately an ADULT love story book filled with graphic SEX. The story takes up where Bared to you left off. If you like Bared TO You then you will also love Reflected in You. My Wife said that she would recommend it.  She also hopes to see Corinne kicked to the curb by Gideon in the next book.  She also wishes it would hurry up with publication.
B00A77II0U|5.0|My son loves this game. Very entertaining. Good graphics and story line. Would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes mysteries.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This was a good gift for our Tim Burton fan. It is a favorite movie at our house.  Everyone likes it.
B008J34466|1.0|This is so hard to believe that i paid so much money to buy a made in mexico disc!!!! How can this happen?
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album has fantastic beats, both serious and light topics and was a fantastic purchase.  I would definitely recommend it.
B004TI5N38|1.0|I found this effort by Baldacci to be poorly written, to the point of &#34;corny.&#34;  When I think of his classics: the Winner, the Camel Club series, Wish You Well...it is as though Zero Day was ghost written by a beginner.
B002JH3TW8|4.0|I bought this to daisy-chain a FW400 drive to a FW800 drive, it work fine; just make sure you have the FW800 drive first on the chain.
B00027JYLC|5.0|This classic pre-code movie is a short film which is still very controversial to this day, I really enjoy the anti-bullying theme and the use of real circus &#34;freaks&#34; who have a great sense of family and protect their own.
B000SEI230|5.0|Another great read! Love all of Nicholas Sparks books! Really knows how to tug at a readers heart strings. Will forever be in my book shelf and I will gladly suggest this for anyone as well as reread it myself
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider and this one is easy to play and see.  I can sit in my recliner and play this game on my Kindle.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This is my favorite book!!! It has the same plot as in the tv show; Ali goes missing, all the girls receive texts from 'A', they find Ali's body. I personally think you should watch the show  first, it helped me understand it better.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved it I thought it was well thought out and we'll written the court room scenes and the dialogue between characters were excellent I'll wait a couple of months and read it again. Well worth the money!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|A good movie with a message.  The whole family will enjoy the movie together.  But there are some discussions about what happens for college social activities.
B000006YXV|5.0|I bought this CD for my wife for Christmas and she positively loves it. I knew she was a big Marvin Gaye fan but was unaware she didn't have any Cd's by him so thats why I bought these two
B0007VZ91C|5.0|Deva Premal makes your practice complete.  This CD will take you to new heights in your practice.  Each arrangment is magnificantly composed.  Definitely recommend for easy listening, yoga practice or as additional to silent/relaxation time.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|A fun app, a nice time waster that doesn't take up too much time. Great when waiting for the last couple of minutes of the oven timer, or when you just need a &#34;me &#34; moment.<br />Engaging, entertaining, but not too thought demanding. Definitly  use the controls to play with the &#34;stars&#34; . Really comes alive when you use the colors
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|If you like 12 Monkeys, Terminator, Back to the Future, or any other time travel movie you will probably find this interesting.  Not great, but not bad.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Have to purchase additional coins.  It really isn't free. Don't like your review program either.  I have nothing else to say.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This story blew my mind in more than a couple ways and it seemed almost realistic.  In case you didn't guess these two teens do have the much needed chemistry for their situation and even then it had problems.  I know their is a sequel and I am planning on getting it.
0547569653|5.0|Awe inspiring. As a runner, it made me want to lace up my shoes and get out in nature ... I felt loke I could run forever, which is a good thing since I'm running a narathon in 11 days :)
B007D2XSW0|1.0|i really like this spp. does what it says, and more.<br /><br />the only issue i have is at times i cannot add text to photos.<br /><br />a great app though.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />this app doesn't allow you to post text to photos at all now. and customer support is nill.<br /><br />SKIP THIS APP!
B0081SPK0I|1.0|As with other games this one does not work with the kindle. The problem is with the tablet but there is no way to know it until you download it.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|Good for just occupying time....keeps you entertained, especially if on a plane with nothing to do. For a free app it is okay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This works great on kindle fire! My son loves it!  If you like temple run you will like this game. Very simple to play but fun.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved the book so much, it makes me so mad then I have to know what happens next so I pick it up again and continue to read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Even though they were teens, it was a great story. Lots of surprises and twist.  I am not sure why the best friend didn't have a full story line, Maybe in another book?
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book I became a  bit confused close to the end when they rescue her but it became clearer I absolutely love it
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I bought this movie for my niece and we sat and watched it together. GREAT MOVIE! my niece is six and I thought it was kind of creepy for a six year old but she loved it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game purely good I've been playing around with it and theirs nearly any bugs at all but it's people should not be greedy and make people spend actual money and a lot of it great game though
0802473156|5.0|This book was so easy to read! I had no idea that I was speaking the wrong love language and my husband was speaking mine wrong too!! This book gives you all the tools for a healthy marriage, you just have to utilize them now. thank you thank you thank you dr. Chapman!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat virtually every other sentence. It showed more of Percy and Annabeth's romance along with everyone else's. It is action packed, heart wrenching, and utterly amazing. I definitely cannot wait for the next one. Write quick, Rick!
1932100660|5.0|The best solutions in life are the simplest. If your Physician hasn't read this book or agree with the underlying premise then you need a new doctor. This book will only be appreciated by people that make decisions on data and good science. This book improved my health and quality of life.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book is the best and I would recommend this book to my daughter Maya Joseph the sweetest girl earth.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|I'm kind of new to this Kindle Fire HD 8.9, but not new to Music Players.  I have Media Monkey on my Desktop Computer.  I downloaded the trial version and tested the program for only 30 minutes before I decided to upgrade to the Pro Version.  This app does all I want it to except play a few videos taken by my Nikon D90 Camera in video mode. Even after converting the videos to MP4 they still didn't work. I'm not an expert with formats just enough to get me in trouble.  I have 15 other MP4 YouTube videos on the device that will play however.  I've installed Vitamio Plugin ARMv7 from Amazon.com app store which shows it's compatible with my Kindle Fire, but it made no difference, and that's OK with me because I use another video player that does work (Personal Videos).  The music is what I'm more interested in playing, and that option in my opinion is FANTASTIC.  All the great things this player can do would take me an hour to tell about. I will say that my music being able to play in the background while I do other things, even continues to play if the Kindle goes to sleep, all while in shuffle mode if I like.  There are 3 main tasks this player will take on.  Music, Videos, and Photos.  All are very easy to setup, and play except for the small problem playing some video codec's as I said before (The reason I gave it 4 stars).  I understand it may have something to do with the Kindle device and not the App?  I would buy this app again, and again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put book down. Love without raw sex.  Good for our youth. Not real, but enjoyable. Thank you for a good nook without fowl language.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great ending to a great series! Well written and I'm glad the author didn't give up on the story like some do at the end.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Able is the best son of Adam and Eve and the best servant of Jehovah but his brother is not a good brother of his cause one time Able's brother got jealous of him that he was blessed by Jehovah cause Jehovah except Able's offer but not his so than he ended up killing his own brother that what's so bad about it.
0763631205|5.0|this is a literary classic for all time it may have not been written word for word from the original text
044020271X|5.0|Another great book by ms Plain. I have read almost all of her novels and have never been disappointed with the read.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I don't normally write reviews, but after watching Planet Earth I felt I should share how amazing it was. I got the widescreen blu ray version ~ the picture quality was absolutely stunning at 1080i, it looked wonderful on my 60' HDTV. The camera work is beyond fantastic and every scene is carefully captured. Specially some of the time lapse scenes, which left me in awe. Sir David Attenborough's soulful commentary adds life to these stunning visuals. Most people never get a chance to explore these places in person, so documentaries like Planet Earth act as a window to experience natural beauty in its purest and richest form. Highly recommended for adults and children alike.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works well. Took a little time to transition from the computer based version. Once I got used to it it was fine.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|very durable and light weight . I take it with me every where and get complemented on it constantly.  How much it looks like a book and the beautiful design.  feels just like a book when I am reading
B000W91RUG|5.0|Big Bang Theory is the best comedy on TV.  Season 1 is great.  The characters and situations are unique and interact with each other so well.
B0083SBJXS|3.0|All my relatives like it, what's wrong with me! I don't like it, bored. Even &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man&#34; better. Poor me :-(
B003B02PFO|4.0|I like Grisham' s style and have read most of his books. His descriptions of things have a familiar feel and make the setting inviting. There is always a redeeming equality to his yarns and that is true here also. The ending is rather abrupt, but tender and leaves a good feeling appropriate for the season..
B005LAII0S|1.0|The quality just fine, the movie - wasting time, I'm glad I didn't go to watch it in a movie theater. Regretted I bought it :-(.
B005JE1KHE|5.0|Agreat series and i couldnt put it down. Loved it so much I ahve started the next series that continues on.
B008KEQM3W|4.0|He had to watch it with me, he was bored, but at the end he said &#34;Good chicks movie&#34;. My daughter likes it too. Going to watch it again this weekend.
B009E3EY4M|4.0|Great show!  What it must have been like to have been there.  Thanks to some great production values and post production work, it's almost like being there.  The fellows sounded very tight and only one song seemed to get a little muddled.  Video and Audio are excellent.  I didn't get nauseous as the video editing switched between cameras and performers but they could have done less of that and it would have been better.  Saw Led Zep back in the mid 70's.  Bow down before me.  This is great fun and highly recommended.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Surprisingly I like it a lot, watching again and again, not my typical reaction to &#34;easy&#34; movies.<br />Very good cast, nice computer effects and sound.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Nice eye candy but a very weak story line detracts from the experience. It was hard to give it much attention.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl is far from a Girl Scout in many ways. As someone who has camped and hiked I was frequently aghast that she would try such a feat. Quite entertaining.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Having spent the time to read the first 4 books I wouldn't want to miss out on what happens to my favorite characters.  I really like that this author does not reprise the preceeding books as he continues the saga.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Acting ok. Bruce was good.<br />For 2041 or whatever the year was meant to be. It just was not good in making me feel like it was in the future.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Every episode that ends just leaves me wanting more. Its so well written and acting is great. For new comers to American Horror Story you don't need to have seen the first season. Though the first season is excellent as well, there is no correlation between seasons except for the use of a lot of the same actors.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I got this for my husband..........it's one of his favorites and we both are very pleased with it.  Highly recommended.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|its a great fun app I love it so much me and my family use it all of the time I love it
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A gentle story that grips the reader with emotional bands of steel. Unique plot, fabulous, well-developed characters, thought-provoking. I have just blown the good part of a day because I sat down to read it and did not get up for 5 hours. Worth every second.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The plot was predictable, but I stayed with the book because I hate to start a book and not read it all the way to the end.  Overall, it was a nice piece of romantic, mindless fluff.
B0064W67IM|5.0|Read it your damned self.<br />Why are you still reading the damned reviews.<br />Really seven more words? Go read it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book so much it is one of my favorites I think its a five star book. Thank you.
B0034JKZ86|3.0|A little disappointed at Disney for making this movie a little dark with the scary imagery of the voodoo scenes.  Especially since Tiana is the first African American Princess.  They should have made it more lighter and family friendly.  The scenes with Tiana and the frog are very cute but some of the imagery of voodoo is not.  Will not recommend this movie.  I hope they make another Disney movie with this beautiful princess more like the other Disney movies.
B007HACDLK|5.0|My wife bought me this book because she knew I was a big Vince Flynn fan.  I have enjoyed every Mitch Rapp book Flynn has written so far.  The only problem is he doesn't write them more often.  The same goes for John Sandford's Prey and Flowers novels... not writing them fast enough.<br /><br />Charles Dukes
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This was a really cute movie.  I am in my 40s and watched the whole movie with my daughter.  When I have kids over I put this movie on and they all stay still and watch it.  Everyone enjoys it.  Good family, friendly movie.  Will recommend to anyone.
B000YHG72E|4.0|It is a good story but I found that it was not as good the second time around. Its still in our holiday lineup but its lost a bit of its honeymoon blush.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This DVD came one day early and in perfect condition.  I thought something must be wrong with it because the price was so low but it was perfect and I've watched it over and over again.  5 star for super service and great product.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|A lovely little film for the whole family. Enjoyable entertainment that you don't have to work for. Animation is lots of fun for story telling and viewing.
0061245097|5.0|If you love vampires, you will love this book.  This is the 2nd book to this series and well worth it.  Loved the 1st one and loved the 2nd one.  I would recommend to anyone who loves vampires.
B007712XAU|5.0|I have always heard about this series. Never had a chance to watch it when it was on TV regularly. Enjoyed it very much!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|this was a really good movie. however there was 1 plot hole that totally affected the end of the movie and really messed up the experience. the ending looks rushed, and the story fails to establish John as 1 man, instead he is 2 men with 2 separate initiatives, while some may see this is a story of 1 man in way will become. the story contradicts itself, if the man from the past changes so should a man from the future, this is something that is established in the movie and then contradicted at the end. all in all looper is a good movie but it is just missing something
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Quirky characters, fairly good plotlines and interesting stories, well worth a look. There's a bit of continuity to the episodes, so try to watch them in order. Enoy!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I could not put this book down, although it is not always an easy read as far as the descriptions of war and brutality are concerned. Still the characters were well drawn and I cannot wait for the final part of the trilogy to be published. From a political viewpoint the Facist and Communist policies are described in detail and although it is work of fiction it has helped me to understand the history of the 2nd World War far more than before.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It wasn't so much that this book is a page turner. I just kept wanting  to get back to the story and the different characters. I surmised  the ending, but wasn't sure until the end. Interesting characters and one could understand why the behaved the way they did. Recommend it highly.
B0058O84G0|5.0|This novel covers the period leading up to and including the First World War. The stark difference between the upper classes and the poor, as well as the position of women of all classes in society make this a very interesting read. I found it difficult to put this book down and the characters really drew me in.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I am hooked on Fringe. I could watch this over and over again. The stories are that fantastic! I got this right on time for Christmas.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|They loved this movie and like having their own copy so that they can watch it whenever they want to.
B008G59IKO|5.0|At first I had to assimilate but now I can't stop listening, excellent ! probably my favorite from the trilogy
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the book. Easy read, plot was well hidden. Characters were easy to associate with and follow. Once I started, it was hard to put down.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game took me a few evenings of play to get through. Not too tough, a bit of back and forth, but not as much as other games I've played.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The book was not what I was expecting. I had heard a lot of people rave about the book, but I was disappointed with the content.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter and her cousins love this game because it is fast pasted. The tutorial was there when the kids needed it. It is addictive, the graphics and color are very good, the sound of the monkeys are very realistic. The kids can't wait to play it again and again.  The only question is where was the treasure or idol that was taken?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is everything the first one was plus so much more the uncertainty of everything makes you keep reading and when it's done you will not be satisfied until you read the next. This is truly<br /> great storytelling I cannot wait to finish this series.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett combines well researched history with thoroughly plausible characters.  Even a segment of history I Thought I was familiar with has become more real to me.  )
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series and I can't wait for season 3 to start on Sunday! This also arrived quickly.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|I have just discovered Diana Krall and I just like Ms Krall's style.  I loved &#34;The Girl In the Other Room&#34; album on sacd.  So, I tried this one &#34;Glad Rag Doll (DE)&#34;  It is quite different, but I like them each on their own merits.  The photo art was cheezie and one of the pictures on the inside was of a look alike.  I like the way all the songs on each album follow a theme throughout.  The first hearing was only so-so but by the third time it became on of my favorites in this genre.  Trying to explain why I like one piece of music over another is like trying to explain why I like one color over another.  But if you like her style you will be delighted with the sonic quality because it is first rate.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I didn't like Angry birds space, but I LOVE this one, I don't understand why you have to pay for it twice though. Once when you buy it and once when you get past the 2 of the levels.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I was disappointed in this moview.  I thought it contrived and pretty juvenile.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Don't waste your time!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I actually had to uninstall this from my phone at one point because I couldn't put this game down.  I have beat it several times and gotten all of the achievements.  If you like this game, I highly recommend getting the PC version - there are a lot of really cool things you can do.
B001706I5I|4.0|Jim Carey as the Grinch is the best casting since Charlie Chaplin played the Little Tramp.  Fantastic Christmas movie.  Rent it!
B009DALSSG|3.0|Really tight and sensitive aiming. Although I am dealing with alot of phantom button presses with the controller. Sometimes It does things on it own. well alot of times it does that. works great as a pc gamepad as well. easy installation.  cord is decent length. Great feeling controller. I do feel it helps my aiming. the buttons feel great for fighting games. the dpad is amazing. the back right and left triggers do have a hook arch in the back. not a full trigger design like original. the corners of the trigger buttons can cause painful bruises  on the index fingers during long periods of play. It hurt for two days. but got better hasnt been a problem since. .the grip and desgin on the controller is excellent it mixes the stable grip of the ps3 controller with the comfort of the 360, and the buttons  feel like a traditional arcade style press. so it feels comfortable. You can not use the regular xbox head sets with this controller due to the design only having the one hole for inserting the audio plug. . not a problem  for me or anyone really just go to your local dollar store and pick up a 2.5 mic headset for cellphones works great.
B000ICZCZS|5.0|One of my top 10 best movies.  You must see this movie before you die (or live another year.)  Rent it!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is cunning and cute he knows how to get around the trouble makers on the job.  He needs a real girlfriend .
B003SI9WYG|3.0|Rented this because it was highly rated and I like Tim Burton.  Expected to like it.  Was let down.  It wasn't as strong as it should have been.
0780747550|5.0|This is not your basic poor kid whining their life away story. If I had read this in high school it may have changed my life. Excellent book club read
1594487154|5.0|This book is the perfect balance between storytelling, theory and practical application.  Pink brings to bear a host of research, proven approaches and personal interviews to weave together an updated guide on how to \\"move\\" people.  In dependable Pink fashion, we have new words to help us understand how we can improve...attunement, buoyancy and clarity, as well as what we need to do...pitch, improvise and serve.  I have already ordered a stack of these books as a pre-read for a business development seminar.  You simply can't lose by spending a few hours of your time reading this book.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|IS THERE REALLY ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY?.  WELL, I LOVE THE ADDITIONAL TRACKS, ABOUT TIME THEY PUT THIS THNG TOGETHER RIGHT. LED ZEP RULES!!!!!!!!!!!
B009E3EY38|5.0|THE BOX OF THE YEAR 2012<br />FANTASTIC A GREAT GIG WITH GREAT ACTORS<br />THE BOX IS ARRIVED BEFORE THE SCHEDULED TIME AND IS ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITIONS
B003UYUQZW|4.0|I just love this movie.  Has a little of everything, very good plot.  Jake isn't bad to look at either!
0545265355|5.0|These books are amazing. Once I started reading one it was hard to put it down. The price was great and the free super saver shipping was even better.
B002YP4FNM|4.0|The album sooner than expected and in good condition. I would give 5 stars but the album cover was worn, however the album itself was in immaculate condition.
B0094K1K42|1.0|No redemption. No learning. The character is obviously mentally ill and yet no one seems to want to do anything about it. A waste of time.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|This program is something I couldn't really get to work.  I might not really be that computer knowledgeable enough to<br />run this program.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games<br />So much better than the movie.  Can`t wait to read the next book in the series. Wow!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loved it; we are both fans of New Girl. Got it quickly and in good shape! Thanks!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|wholesome family fun from age 6 to 35!  I dont worry about graphic violence and the kids like it. A+
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another great read by a great author!!!  I couldn't put this book down, and that is what a good book is all about!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|My wife wanted to see it and I watched it with her.  It had a good story and I enjoyed the music and cinamatography of the animation.  It was funny and enjoyable and had a good message.
030758836X|1.0|There are many angry female writers out there convinced evil American men are out to get them (except for those who are dumb enough to publish their novels) and this novel is merely a descent into typical post-modern radical madness. There is no \\"war on women\\" but there is clearly a war on men. And to think the writer has the audacity to write from a male point-of-view! But that's not the worst of it. The worst--the writing is horrible. You can find that out for yourself with the \\"take a look\\" feature. Don't waste your time or money on this mindless tripe. Read Winnie the Pooh instead.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|My 7 year old thought it was 'the best thing ever.'  She was and is completely fascinated with it.  I was completely bored.  So, if your entertainment threshold is low, it might be the game for you.  The fact that it was free was the only great part for me.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I bought this for a non-computer savvy friend who mentioned to me that it was his favorite holiday movie. He had worn out his black and white VHS copy and could not find the black and white version on DVD in regular stores and he really disliked the colorized version. After a quick amazon search, I found this one, read the other great reviews and purchased. He absolutely LOVES the DVD and says the film looks beautiful in its restored but original black and white format. Really happy with the purchase and how easy it was to find and compare against the other versions available to find the right one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|LOVED EVERY SINGLE WORD! COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! Wish it was longer, sad that I am finished!  GREAT BOOK!
B0090XLDKY|5.0|My 19 yr old stepdaughter so loves this movie. this is actually the third time I have had to purchase this movie in the past 4 years.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|I purchased this movie for my teenager granddaughter at her request.  We watched it as a family over Christmas and everyone completely enjoyed it.  Would recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|At first I felt that it sort of lagged but all of a sudden it picked up and I am in love with another book by Nicholas Sparks !!!! Thoroughly enjoyed this book, sad that it ended.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Love this movie. Received it quickly. I love old movies and audrey hepburn so this was definitely a great movie!
B005PK553C|4.0|It has an interestingly creepy storyline! I would definitely recommend this series to others. I can't wait to get through the whole season!
B0049VZ222|5.0|This series is addictive! The graphics are very real looking though so be careful letting children watch it.  I bought the entire first season an episode at a time. I am waiting on my DVD of season 2 now. Can't wait!!!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Easy read .... read  in 3 days ...great book but you grow frustrated with the main character  towards the end ... I would recommend
B0085Z3B2Q|3.0|I thought I'd like this movie more, but honestly... it's kind of annoying... it's good to throw in every once in awhile to break up the monotony of Dora and Elmo, but this is destined for the $5 bin at Wal-Mart. HOWEVER, if you like this movie the product itself is great! Good extra features on the main disc and the DVD and Digital Copy are always great for having on car trips.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|If you're looking for a fantasy series with excellent yet flawed characters, look no further.  This is an excellent tale involving characters who would normally never meet coming together to join on a quest.  I found the story interesting, but the characters even more so.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|This has to be one of the most underrated cartoons out there... my kid loves it, my wife and I love it too. The 3D is great. My only complaint is the BluRay disc requires extra storage space to run BDLive content. If you have a cheaper BluRay player, you probably won't be able to watch the BluRay disc without adding a thumb drive to the USB port. However, the 3D disc has the option of watching in 2D so we typically just use the one disc. The bonus standard DVD and Digital Copy are great for having on car trips.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|This film contained a good dose of action and some suspense, but overall it featured a mediocre, unoriginal plot.  Some of the scenes (assassinations of bound and hooded prisoners) were a bit disturbing.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Bought it as a Christmas present and the wife loves it!! If anyone loves the nashville tv show, I would recommend this CD!!
0446580848|1.0|What a disappointment after waiting so long for a john Corey novel<br />No suspense no build up - a completely flat book reliant on past novels to propel this one's sales<br />Nelson we all know you can do much much better
B00948EPOQ|5.0|My favorite Woody Allen movie. The script is smart and playful on so many levels. This movie inspires and transports your mind to new heights. I've watched it many times and still find myself laughing.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I like tossing birds. It's a thing I enjoy. The Star Wars theme is cool, and I like the graphics, but if you are looking for a real puzzler, this ain't it.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I don't know how many times i hace watched this movie and it always makes us laugh out loud, a classic!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|How can you go wrong with an app that lets you break buildings with a sling shot. Love the app.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well written and easily read. Makes you want to read the next book in the series as soon as possible!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Big maroon 5 fan. This album does not disappoint and reasonably priced. Would recommend to any maroon 5 fan. Get it!
B004TI5N38|3.0|I've read better books by him, but this one was just ok.  Good enough to while away a few hours if you have nothing better to do.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun way to help your memory and mind.  I loved it and fun to play while waiting for some one
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Season five has been highly underrated by many, but I think it is the perfect next step in the story. Don is making a new life with Megan, Joan is struggling with her marriage and a new baby etc.<br />Ignored by the Emmys, but not by lovers of fine drama.
B003K025V4|5.0|Bought as a gift for my daughter. CD showed up faster than I expected.  She seems very happy with it.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie has some good moments that generated a few laughs from a chuckle to a gut busting guffaw.  Then it got weird and stupid.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|You will love this heart felt holiday movie during the holiday's.  This movie does a great job threading together all of the different story lines.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|The package arrived on time and in great shape, the case is made from a wet suit material.  Works great in padding and protecting the kindle from dust and moisture. Snug fit.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. A great story, interesting, funny & some heartbreak. It wasn't the ending I was expecting and that was quite refreshing. Would definitely recommend.
B0080K3G4O|5.0|I loved this book and the experience of reading it through the holidays surrounded by family of different faiths and perspectives on \\"happiness.\\"  Never before have I found a book that sums up all the thoughts I've had about \\"the cult of optimism\\" and that gives you practical and concise ideas of how to be different but have the same goal of being happy.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|This is just what I wanted. I love listening it to it on my way to work! Cheaper than downloading it from itunes!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I downloaded this in my phone and my son loves playing it but, he wants it on his Nabi 2 and it doesn't seem to be compatible with it. The game is very fun and keeps him eentertained!!
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|This was a great buy. I love it! It's like seeing the movie again! You will like it too! HAPPY!
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Lately I have been trying to more coherently form my thoughts on why I didn't care for \\"Inglorious Basterds\\". Now that I think about it some more, it was a matter of inconsistency of tone and pointless violence.<br /><br />With \\"Inglorious Basterds\\", Tarentino didn't seem to know exactly what kind of movie he was making and he switched back and forth between styles with no rhyme or reason. I know people say that's his \\"style\\", but he has proven he can work within his \\"style\\" and still make a movie that works within its own universe if nowhere else. Here he jumped so randomly between Parisian/subtitled art house movie to exploitation flick to war drama with such quickness that the story lost all sense of flow and I was constantly being knocked out of the movie like a car crash. I have seen these three styles worked together before and to do it well you have to flow one into the other as a consequence of the story and not a jump cut that seem to exist only as a result of the director's inability to blend them together.<br /><br />As far as the violence goes I really don't mind gory, even gratuitous violence, as long as it serves the story and doesn't merely exist as a gag. For instance the difference between the Hitler skull destruction scene near the end when compared to a similar death in \\"Glory\\". In \\"Glory\\" a commander's head popped like a ripe zit during a close up and splattered everyone around him in dripping bits of brain matter and hair. Over, done, quick and pointed. It made its impact and moved on. In \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" the violence is such a distinct entity in the exploitation sections of the movie that it felt like Tarentino was sitting around with some buddies saying, \\"hey you know what'd be so super gross?!\\" and then he built a movie around it. It never felt like it served a plot or a direction for the story. Even \\"Hobo With A Shotgun\\" seemed to have a reason for most of the gratuitous violence it showed and there was a consistent tone to the film. That movie was messed up beyond all reason, but the film makers kept us firmly rooted in a world that made sense, at least to itself and it obeyed its own rules.<br /><br />If this had been a clips movie of short films and it were edited into distinct sections where one third was the straight narrative of the girl, one third was gory exploitation, and one third was the ending where they come together, all presented one right after the other instead of interspersed within one another I might have found a middle ground with the movie. As it was I just didn't enjoy it. Editing it differently may have provided us with a far better movie.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I don't know why I didn't buy this when the movie first came out but I love it. I enjoy listening to it on my way to work. Cheaper than downloading it from iTunes even with the freight.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Not a type of book that holds my interest for much time.  I'm sure it is a well written book but not for me.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I like DeMille, and &#34;The Panther&#34; is not a bad read.  It is, however, a bit long and plodding.  On the positive side, it does offer a fascinating and in depth look at the country of Yemen.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|Skrillex is a dubstep genious and this album has several of his hits like Bangarang, Devil's Den, and a project song he did with Ellie Goulding. Very cool stuff.
0385535139|4.0|&#34;The Litigators&#34; is a pleasant bit of escape.  Grisham shows the seedy side of lawyering, but also takes it where it can do much good.  Most of all, this book is a pleasant, easy read.
B0080K3G4O|4.0|An antidote to the books that only practise positive attributes without addressing the underlying causes. This book helps and is actually a great guide as an antidote.m
1452101248|4.0|I saw this book in a little Cambridge store where they had cool novelty items. Loved the booked for the great recipes and colorful illustrations and ended up getting it from Amazon because it was better priced. I gave it as a gift to someone who loves cooking, because as a cook myself I would’ve loved to receive that book. It’s a very nice/expensive looking book with very interesting recipes that you just can’t wait to try because the illustrations look so irresistible.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Not a bad story line. A little cheesy, but overall an easy read.  Enjoyed the twist between the characters needs throughout the story. Would read another book by this author.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Traveling and had a hard time getting this for my wife, huge KRF so I went to amazon bought it, downloaded it and she was listening to it right after the release.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Wife got it for her ipod. she said she likes it, that all i know about the thing called pinterest
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I like buying music through Amazon. Easy to do and easy to download. Wish there were not so many players to download. Music is awesome listen to every track.
B009POCG2C|5.0|As usual Clint Eastwood delivers a great performance.  As he depicts a typical older macho guy he also delivers a message from the heart for his love of baseball and his daughter.  She finds and loves her real Dad.  This movie leaves you smiling.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I've read so many negative reviews about this book, people saying it was all about perversion and sex. Well, first of all, I think only about ten percent of the book was actually about sex, the other ninety percent was about two people trying to find their own version of love in each other. It was sad and lonely, and left tears brimming in my eyes at the end.
B00AHSINKO|1.0|The previews to this movie are really misleading...too much drama. Was expecting more like &#34;It's Complicated&#34; but seemed more like &#34;Deep Throat&#34;
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's working fine.  It was downloaded onto my Kindle Fire and appears to be working just fine, so we're happy.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|I love love love this game, my only complaint is that its sometimes a bit slow but hey its free!!!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Snow White is one of many great Disney classics that I just love.  I'm 40 years old n still collecting the classics ad well as today's favorites.  The old movies never cease to amaze me how they were made.  Long before cg was around every single thing that happens in these classics are hand drawn n then put together 2 make the movie I can't get over how long it must've taken to make one of these hour long movies that's a lot of drawing on someone's part.  The classic story of good and evil and that in the end love conquers all.  Great movie no matter how old u are or how many times you've seen it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This Is an amazing book .<br />I finish this book in 2 days I hope they have a next book fir diary of a wimpy kid!!!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Love Clint Eastwood as he would be great even in his sleep. Amy Adams is just as good. Justin Timberlake is the only sore spot in my opinion as he comes across as an actor who belongs to the minor leagues. All in all, a good, pleasant movie.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|This movie had me routing for the characters thought out to finally be united with one another.  It was a pleasantly good movie.
0670022705|5.0|Traveling through civilizations by the objects that were important to the people is fascinating. Writing is just fair and from BBC Radio Broadcasts, but if you like a different perspective to history through the ages, you will enjoy this book.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Definitely worth looking into if your into middle age games. Have had minor problem with glitches, nothing to concern myself over. Enjoy the game play and the ability to upgrade as I went.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I  like it because it slowly builds skills. It makes you stop and think about  each puzzle and the previous solution does not necessarily fits the next.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|- sorry to say, but the story line was weak, and I am not a girl having (teenage) issues with my mother to be able to relate to this one. Regardless who was the target audience, is this really made so that there's a first major female character done by Pixar? What about pre-teen kids? It felt as if too many categories and groups of people were supposed to be covered (somehow) and it did not work out, as it always does with trying to be commercial and appropriate....
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this darn game. It is similar to farmville but you dont have to be on facebook (of which I can't stand) I love dragons in general so this is primetime gaming for me. Garauntee you will be hooked once you start.
0446580848|3.0|I have read all of Nelson Demille's books and am always excited when the next one comes out.  However, I was very disappointed in this book.  I have always enjoyed John Corey & his wife, especially when they were hunting the Lion!  This book was very slow and I think Mr. DeMille could have written it in an about 150 pages if he had left off half of John Cory's asides througout the book.  I enjoy Cory's sarcastic sense of humor, but enough is enough!  The plot was great but very slow moving, and I wasn't surprised at anything that happened.<br />Mr. DeMille did present a lot of history about Yemen, and I had to look up on a map where exactly Yemen was. The plot about searching for a terrorist was good, especially that the terrorist had been American born; but there was something lacking in the storyline.  I hope his next book brings more to the table.  His best book by far was THE CATHEDRAL, but I also enjoyed his books about the Gold Coast of Long Island and Plum Island.
B008K8U13K|5.0|This like all sonic games i've ever played is great. Sonic is timeless. I loved it as a kid and my 5 year old loves it now.
B003L77G06|5.0|the one thing my in laws and i can agree on is this show.  we love it.  it was the perfect gift.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|My son plays this on his kindle. It's great when i need him out of my hair for a second.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|i am a sucker for this movie.  you is smart,  you is kind, you is important.  i could watch it again.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Seems a little crazy this was an entertaining film. I could watch him twirl that axe all day! It's a neat film because he still goes into politics and becomes president while killing vampires on the side.. You'll get as much history from this film as you would from Spielberg's movie and the icing on the cake is to see Abraham Lincoln as an axe twirling badass hacking vampires.. Can't go wrong here.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Agree with all of the comments recognizing the film as great. Wanted to also acknowledge the soundtrack as being very integral to the feel of the story.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Thanks to special effects you don't even need to hire real dwarves anymore.. This film was entertaining and despite the dwarves Chris Hemsworth still steals the show. Everybody made fun of Charleze Theron's crummy english accent but it wasn't all bad. Everyone knows the worst brittish accent ever was Kevin Costner in Robin Hood, this wasn't even close to that. Kristen Stewart wasn't all that bad in this. Not a lot of dialog from her, which I appreciate. She still doesn't seem to want to close her mouth very much. She still has that same blank expression on her face all the time. So she doesn't really speak and it's not Twilight so it's got my vote!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|After seeing this author on Oprah's Super Soul Sunday, I knew I needed to read this book. Although I'm already a believer, it places a peace in you about dying. Recommended for both believers and non...you'll be convinced for sure there is a Heaven!
B008ASLNN2|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the first Sherlock Holmes and A Game of Shadows did not disappoint! Action packed, funny, and clever. Downey is a master, Jude Law is awesome.. If you look past the quirky music, Guy Ritchie has developed a big name franchise with a unique style. It's worth seeing, and you can see it over and over again. It doesn't get old.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A truly wonderful book that you will think about each time you look at you dog.  It is a story told from the heart and eyes of a family dog.  It contains a heartfelt storyline with characters that you will become attached to and only want what is best for them.  It will also mind you that in the end doing what is right is definitely what you should do.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|If you saw the film and liked it, read the graphic novel.. It's not the same at the end but the amazing thing about this is, I would say that the movie follows the graphic novel really close.. I'm talking like WORD FOR WORD! You'll be impressed at all the classic scenes in the film are straight from the book, literally word for word. It will give you a new appreciation if you're a Watchmen fan.
B009G78EE2|5.0|So much diversity and levels of fun, intrigue and depth in this album. I hope everyone listens, enjoys and learns from this. Great hip hop roots, fantastic production and great sound quality here. Ryan Lewis and Macklemore have a great partnership going here. There are fun tracks, dance tracks, heartfelt and inspiring tracks all on one album. Check out their other stuff too, it's great in it's own way.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The only problem with this game is that you do not want to stop playing it, fun and easy to use.
0066620996|5.0|I had to purchase this book for my MBA class on strategy, and actually ended up enjoying it very much.  The author is fairly easy to read and all the information inside is data driven and analytically derived.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|This CD really is only the highlights! I would wait out for the complete soundtrack, whenever that happens. If you want this in the meantime, it's worth it! I've enjoyed listening to Bring him home and stuff like that. Some of the songs are spliced and cut short and moved around, like &#34;Look Down&#34; (cutting all of the individual prisoners verses). Most notably, this album is missing &#34;Do you hear the people sing?&#34;, &#34;who am I?&#34;, and &#34;a little fall of rain&#34;. I enjoyed the movie though. Overall, good and dedicated cast. Some better than others, but it's okay - As an actor first, I really enjoyed the raw and real aspect of the singing.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Classic, timeless, and spirited.  A moving and inspirational story.  A must read each and every Christmas.  God Bless us everyone!  ....Tim.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It's great to have all the discs in one set. I can now get rid of the individual DVD's and have more room on the shelf for more films.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Bought this for my teenage daughter.  We laughed through almost the entire movie.  Silly teenage movie about Acapella Glee Clubs.  Aca-scuse me?  It was Aca-awesome.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Well written stories spun together in a clever way with humor and suspense. Matt Smith is a great Doctor and Amy Pond & Rory Williams bring a much needed friendship/bond to the story.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|The plot is lame, the puns are painfully bad, the acting is horrible, and it's AMAZING.<br /><br />If you expect anything more than lots of people blowing up you will be greatly disappointed, but if that's what you want it's the greatest movie of all time.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Muse is great and this album was nothing less. As far as the download is concerned, It was convenient and decent quality.
1401232590|5.0|I bought The Long Halloween as a Christmas gift, but I couldn't help to go ahead and read it before I gave it away, and I am so glad I did.<br /><br />The story follows the Caped Crusader, Harvey Dent, and James Gordon and their attempts to identify and stop the Holiday Killer, a mysterious villain who murders members of Gotham's crime family on major holidays. Batman must also continue his fight against his old enemies, such as the Joker, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and more.<br /><br />The story is very well-written. It draws the reader right into the city of Gotham and refuses to let go. There is a lot of suspense, mystery, and action, which is to be expected of any Batman comic. The story does a brilliant job of tying together the main story and the several subplots, and ties everything up very nicely in a shocking and memorable conclusion.<br /><br />The art is one of the best I have seen in a comic book. There is a great mixture between the realistic drawings of Batman and company and the abstract, fearsome villains, such as the Joker, who is depicted with a very large mouth full of many long, crooked teeth. The characters are very memorable and very beautifully done, with equally beautiful settings full of color. There are many panels in the book that are colored in black and white, and, surprisingly, many of those panels are more beautiful than some of the colored panels.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight or a Batman fan in general, this book will not disappoint you. I almost regret giving it away!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|terrible- convaluted....terrible...orginal way better. Dont waste your time, they dont even go to mars...What the ...<br />some of the acting ok- director-BAD
B005FISBTO|5.0|Haven't got it yet, so I really can't say yet.  I have loved all the rest so far so I can't image I won't like it!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Still a great series thus far. A lot of twists and turns, extremely well written in my opinion I can't wait to start the next one which I am downloading now!!!!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I'm reading this book, first off I can't say as I am a fan of the homosexual setting in it. My kids would read this book and I don't want them introduced to this without me stepping in first, and I don't want this book to be the reason I HAVE to go there early. I try to share books with my sons as much as possible, or read to them. I would NOT read this book to them, it's NOT child friendly by any means. I did notice all the \\"wrong words\\"  waist instead of waste (e.g. Clean up the horses waist, should read \\"the horses waste.\\") and another one I have caught was referring to \\"wood\\" but was instead reading, \\"would\\". The author needs to fire the editor or whoever proofreads the books for publishing. Other than those 2 issues, the book is going fine for now.
B004AQR24W|5.0|I want to keep this short and sweet....this movie is amazing! great action, good fight scenes, tons of bad guys and an excellent cast(duh!).<br />I never saw the original Theatrical version but this version gives us just enough character/plot development without slowing down the frenzy of action and violence which is the main reason to see this film.  you can tell all the guys had a great time together filming this movie and the chemistry is obvious on the screen....excellent cast i loved Jet Li and Couture!<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this movie to anyone seeking some action-packed entertainment and some nostalgia from the glory days of action-hero movies....i can't wait to see the sequel!!!<br />WATCH THIS NOW!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I actually really like this book. You got to see a relationship bloom right before your eyes, and it had some passion which I love. I would recommend it to friends.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Can't say enough about this show, I thought the first three season were great season four even better!!!! Worth watching over and over!!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Excellent book. Fast read. I enjoyed the fact that the book was told from a 5 year old's perspective. Highly recommend it.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Amazing, wow!!! Awesome show, can't wait to see what happens in each season!!! Definitely worth every penny for the box sets!!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|for a free game it's very fun and entertaining for all ages. if you like Perry, cut rope, where's my water you will like this game as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best I downloaded it on alllllll of the devices in my house there are no problems
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I wish that I had had a book with pages I could turn so that I could speed through the truly tedious parts of the audible recording.  The underlying plot had some interesting twists, but when the main character started sharing his inner reflections on his life, or on life in general, the narrative slowed to a painful, redundant crawl.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best thing I've read in a long time.  Looking forward to reading more books by Gillian Flynn.  Loved the twists...and. wondering if there might be a sequel.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I thought I would like this movie, but the longer I watched it more I realized I was wasting my time.  Its starts off with an interesting premise, but degrades into a hopeless and depressing nightmare that doesnt make any sense.<br /><br />Its not based on reality but rather a nightmare.  If I want to watch horror I will, but this was just a survival film trying to be something else.  All crap if you ask me...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This an Amazing book by an Amazing Author!! BEST BOOK I HAVE READ YET!  TRUELY AWESOME! I can't wait read more from her!!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|One of the best Network Series I have ever seen.  Hope it continues forever with the same cast for several more seasons
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game but fairly short. Good story line though and a bit of a twist ending. Also like that the puzzles you don't wanna play you can just skip.
B005FISBTO|4.0|Even a weak season of Dexter is better than most TV show seasons as they age.  The cast continues to do solid work, with some interesting guest turns by Olmos and Hanks in this one.
B000026FJ6|5.0|This album was inspired by Arthur C Clarke's book of the same name.  As a stand alone project, it is good.  But once you have read the book, it makes a lot more sense.
B003719G40|5.0|This is a great book and helped me realize how I can help my relationship with my boyfriend. I hope he enjoys it as much as I did.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|The world-building, action, sense of humor, and character development not only make this a fantastic science fiction book, but a great military fiction book as well.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It looks better on Blu-Ray than in theaters. Glad I bought this collection and seeing it all over again just reminded me how much I love these movies. The extras alone is worth it. The admiration and respect the actors have for Christopher Nolan is great to see. Glad I have this set to view over and over again.
B008518MOW|1.0|I like iTunes, everything in one place, nice and simple.  Competition is a good thing...usually.  Along comes UltraViolet with their &#34;digital copy&#34; that was just rights to stream a movie.  A lot people complained or ordered their movies from the UK, so they finally gave the option to actully download.  Along comes Sony and in order to get your digital copy, they require you to manage not only their titles but all your UV titles at their site, on their apps.  More apps to download.  More passwords to remember.  More of your information out there.
0696204800|5.0|This is my all time favorite pattern book!! If I could only afford one pattern book, I hope that is not so, this would be it! Loaded with 250 pages of patterns for patchwork, appliqué and many are easily adaptable to foundation piecing. Blocks are shown in 4&#34; size but I have enlarged them on a copier with great success. Each of the blocks are shown in clear concise color photos. There are many wonderful themes scattered throughout the book, including: Teatime, Thirties, Flowers, Noah's Ark, and every holiday you can think of. The Preface offers 40 different projects you could make with these blocks, including wearable art.

B0091REZMW|4.0|Great fun. Good for the whole family. Great brain workout too. Good way to pass time. My kids love working together on it. Great for long drives in the car.
B005LAIISU|5.0|This was another great animated movie of the Ice Age. All of the previous ones were awesome too and I just wonder what another one will be like if there is one on the way. I am amazed at how the animating is done and the brilliant stories of these movies, bravo to the teams that put this together. I am 76 yrs. of age and just enjoy these animations....so it is not just for the younger generation, we older ones enjy it too.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I picked this game up as the free app of the day a couple days ago and can't put it down since. It is a great update to the original Sega Dreamcast version. the extra levels will ensure hours of enjoyment.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|I am a fan of Cary Grant and I don't remember ever seeing this movie he made.<br />I was totally surprised while viewing it and like it immensely.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Finally, a Disney princess with both parents intact! We need more movies to help teach that the world will fall apart if families don't stick together
B005LAIIQC|2.0|I am disappointed in this movie. The actor is good but the story is confusing, takes a while to understand just what the theme is and I am disappointed that Matt Damon wasn't the star in this. I watch the other Bourne movies quite a bit and enjoy them but this is a throw-away!!!!!  Sorry but that is my opinion.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|worth every dolar. nice package, better content.<br />best christmas gift ever :) If you are a hardcore RATM fan, don`t miss this!
B006RXPUR2|4.0|Due to Casey Affleck's acting, I did like the movie.  The storyline progresses well, but the subject matter is grim.  Poor people, drug abuse, and nothing good to look forward to.  The disappearance of the little girl ties all this together.  Casey Affleck is always so good in any project I plodded through it.  I wouldn't recommend it for a great movie, but it's okay.
0385344228|5.0|Absolutely Riveting! I couldn't put the book down. Good writing a good twist and suspenseful. I recommend reading this book.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I got this book to try the whisper sync feature and was quite pleasantly surprised. The story is a bit different from the movie that we are all more familiar with, but it is a good read. I was not nearly as frightened of the flying monkeys in the book version.
B001EN71CW|3.0|I don't normally do this, but I have to say the quality of these Blu-ray disc is very dissappointing.  I'm glad I did not pay full price for this or I would be returning these.  Some of the shows look like they were really compressed, and some scenes are so dark that you can barely see what is going on.  Blu-ray is not supposed to look worse than tv.  I'm dissappointed in the release of such an inferior product.
1455502758|4.0|If you are looking for self pity and bereavement, this most certainly is not the place.<br /><br />This is a travel book, in the city of tumorville and how the residents and the authorities in that city deal with issues and harsh realities facing them. There is something innately calm and positive about Hitchens, in my opinion. He was, one of the literary geniuses of his time loaded with a mighty arsenal of information, witty arguments, punches and cheapshots and this is reflected is my favorite sentence of the book, also heard in a lot of his last interviews (60 minutes and Anderson Cooper, to name a few) “To the dumb question ‘Why me?’ the cosmos barely bothers to return the reply: Why not?”.<br /><br />He also takes you to a nostalgic ride, where he discusses his discussions on Nietzsche, Russell, Orwell and many others I have not heard of. There seems to be a pragmatism associated with everything in his life. There is a chapter in his book where he most modestly says, &#34;I am not battling cancer, it is fighting me.&#34; and &#34;You feel swamped with passivity and impotence: dissolving in powerlessness like a sugar lump in water.&#34; There are bouts of wittiness as well, &#34;If I convert it's because it's better that a believer dies than that an atheist does.&#34;<br /><br />If you are accustomed to the likes of &#34;The Missionary position&#34; and &#34;The god is not Great&#34;, the lack of aggression here might be upsetting at first but once the tone is set, this book will be a good read.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Best all around S.F.<br />I've read in years! Full of humour with a great story line.  I'm going to look for more Andy Weir books.
B007RE0SCW|3.0|I purchased Clawdeen and one of her companions for a child whom I don't know for Christmas so I don't know for sure whether she liked it or not.  I'm not much of a fan of this series of dolls but I felt that the price was just fair enough for the items received with the doll.
0439023521|5.0|Couldn't put any of the books down. The world Collins created was easy to immerse yourself. The characters were amazing and you couldn't help but want the best for them and revenge those that died.
080726203X|2.0|Disappointing that the CD was obviously overwritten with the story.  It was possible to hear some of the songs in the background.  All the song titles are still showing - no chapters or book references.  I was disappointed and feel a little cheated since it was supposed to be a brand new copy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use this app all of the time. Love it! It is simple, easy to use, and I have had no issues with game play.
B007WV05GY|2.0|Overall this was mostly a watchable movie.  I dind't really expect it to be good.  I watched it merely because Liam Neeson was in it.  However, if you prefer movies with resolutions/endings then you should avoid this one.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|This book/ author was recommended to me. It started a little slow, but I realized that this was necessary to set the stage for the complicated plot that was taking place over two different time periods. I ended up being totally hooked and found myself looking forward to the next opportunity to read. I highly recommend it.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I had no expectations going into this movie.  With the exception of a couple of CG overdoses this movie does no wrong.  It's extremely entertining and an imaginative twist on history.  It's definitely worth a watch.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I choose the four star rating as this case gets light use from my 8 year old son.  he doesnt travel to work or school or commute or anything.  This is a great entry level case.  If you are looking for some monster protection outfit this is not it.  But we LOVE it.<br /><br />Case is easy to clean and use and is tough enough for us.  It stands up pretty well in movie mode as well
B004LWZWGA|2.0|Clearly, this film appeals to many viewers and likely, this is just not my cup of tea, but I found this installment to start out on an intriguing note and then just nose-dive from there.  The story line seemed muddled, the acting uninspired and the outcome contrived. The action and dialog could have been condensed here to approximately 90 minutes; instead, the plot was dragged out to the point of being tiresome.  Also, is it really necessary for the tone to be primarily so deadly and dreary all the time?  Is this not based on comic book characters and a fictional city, etc.? Where's the camp? I mean really, \\"Why so serious...?\\"
B009DJB8I2|5.0|The soundtrack is just as memorable as the test chambers and personality complexes of the robots. Ellen McClain returns and once more sings gracefully. Want You Gone is right up there in my favorites songs, along with Robots FTW.<br /><br />The best puzzler game of 2011's soundtrack is the most original music I've ever heard. You'll really get some songs to test by, that's for sure.
B001H1SVO8|4.0|I've seen this movie about 400 million times so it's fair to say I like it. Never has schizophrenia been more romantic and beautiful (sorry Russel Crowe). There's nothing like the constant sound of bone hitting meat and smoking and cursing and general mayhem. I am Jack's impressed brain.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|loved it! Couldn't put it down! Fell in love with the characters, especially Holder. Great twist in the story. You won't be disappointed.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|This is a wonderful album. I enjoy it immensely. It is dramatic, cinematic, very emotional, and as sullen as ever. Fiona's lyrics are astounding as usual and the melodies remind me of her older work with a bit of a new twist. If you love Fiona's work you will fall in love with this too.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't mind erotic tinted books, but in this case you are better off reading a porno magazine. It might be more truthful.
B005MP28B2|5.0|visually a work of art. a deep spiritual statement about the ultimate relationship with Life Itself. Could watch again for more insight.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has for sure crafted an enthralling story even better than her series for younger children. Though many would say this book is for teens and adults I think it is just as good for children as young as third grade (when I read it) and it is dramatic and humorous and every other aspect you could hope for when reading a novel such as this. Her relationship with Peeta especially the next two books is very romantic how she finally truly falls for him, but her brief time with Rue is so sweet and heartbreaking when she is finally killed by Marvel. I can't decide between the Hunger Games, Harry potter, Percy Jackson, Kane Chronicles, or mysterious Benedict society but this is definitely on my favorite list. But if you are deciding if you should read it,I recommend you do.
B00631VJIC|5.0|I ordered this as a Christmas present, because my BF is obsessed with the show! it has been in the CD player in his car since he opened it. Awesome music!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Im an aging baby boomer whose favorite comic book character was Captain America, and this movie faithfully brought CA to life!
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Simple and predictable story line. Characters are poorly developed. I would not watch it the 2nd time. g gy dtd
1451627289|5.0|I have been both deeply thrilled and as equally disappointed by King over the years. However, 11/22/63 just blew me away. This book is well written, and one who has studied the Kennedy assisination at length (and no, I am not a conspiracy theory wantabe) King has woven fact with fiction as well as I have ever read. The ending gave me the chills and I only hope when they make the movie (and someone will) I can only hope they are as faithful to the story as the care asking out into it,
B001706I5I|4.0|Watched while curled up on the couch with the family. Great show, bits for mom and dad that go over the heads of the little ones.<br /><br />Carrey is perfect.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|First, I love Captain America and all the characters in this movie just blended so well. It makes Transformers look cartoonish.
B00062PN6I|3.0|I've had Behringer headphones before and I've been happy with them.  I purchased these for use by a child, perhaps my mistake. Where the cord enters the headphone is VERY weak and with in two months had worn through and finally broke.<br /><br />If they were for use by someone other than a child they might have held up better.  This isn't Behringer best headphones and that should be kept in mind.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Very real depiction of Vietnam War - felt like you were there. Pretty graphic but necessary to tell the story the way it was.
0439023491|5.0|The book was in good shape. There were no problems. All the pages were in the book. I enjoyed the book.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  Horror movies are easy to make fun of, but to do it well still takes talent, and this movie hits the spot.  The acting is all great, and it's a great feel good movie.. so much so that any plot holes or inconsistencies don't really seem to matter.  If you don't mind watching people die in hilarious ways, this movie is for you.
B00000J048|2.0|interesting. looks cool. but not all that exciting. i think i should have gotten the one that you can build into towers. much more interactive.
0679805273|5.0|I'm a HS teacher, and I use this book as a yearbook ,actually have them dated back nine years, and they're much cheaper than a yearbook for me. The messages in story are fitting for milestones from kindergarten to college. I have a friend who bought one for her son, and she's going to have each grade teacher sign her sons book over years and give to him as gift at graduation from high school. I have yet  to find a replacement, just so fitting for life transitions of any age.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|This would be a 5 star app. However, in solo mode the AI ends up being too stupid and easy (even on hard) about 30% of the time. Then another 30% of the time the AI is allowed to generate more units than they have credits for which makes even the easiest solo level (Dead Monk) unbeatable on hard with humans vs bugs. Fix the wonky and cheating AI and I will give you 5 stars.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Could not figure this one out.  Lack of direction in how to place objects.  Ate a lot of memory too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian was perfect at sending the reader through twists and turns throughout the book. I wish he would have chosen a different ending, however, because it didn't really make me feel any sense of \\"closure.\\" Which I need!! I feel like it was the most boring possible way to end that story- other than that the book was a delight to read!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked that everything is so easy to find. It's equipped with all sorts of information. And opens up a world of new words. I recommend this book to men, women, and children alike.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|\\"The Night Sky\\" and its companion data package (another whole dollar...) is a good app for someone casually interested in what they're seeing overhead.  It's capable of showing you the location of various orbiting objects (everything from communications satellites to the International Space Station to discarded rocket boosters whose orbits haven't deteriorated enough to burn up yet).  It also shows constellations, and has a \\"night vision\\" mode that uses a red screen to help prevent impeding your vision by giving your eyes too MUCH light.  It will also give you the names of stars, as well as information on them.  It's probably not a grand app for an astrophysicist, but it's fun for the casual observer such as myself.<br /><br />The only problem I've found with it is that the constellation shapes tend to fade out a little quickly, but no complaints beyond that.<br /><br />Enjoy!
8866130907|5.0|Have been buying this for several years now. Truly pocket size, several page designs to suit personal preferences, and the legends of Picasso, Hemingway and Chatwin. A timeless classic.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game it is so fun to challenge myself and try to beat my own personal best score.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Very fun but interface is an issue. if you have big fingers placing the &#34;Goo&#34; can be difficult they could implement an easier way to do it. but still a great game
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great for a free game. It's a really fun puzzle! The critters look more like jello though. :P Makes me hungry.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|It was free during the holidays. Tried it out and it is much nicer than i expected. It has a ton of features and lets me listen to NPR and I can record it. Havent had any issues with local radio other channels it can be finnicky some of the channels take forever to load and then say cannot play,
0446573027|3.0|Compared to some of Baldacci's other books, this was a bit slow. Not a very thrilling thriller. I held off reading this one after all the comparison claims. I didn't find that to be the case, but for a first-in-series wasn't impressed. Usually enjoy his books, and will tackle the second, but not for a while.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|Yes it looks cool but they have live wallpapers of this stuff come on this is a customizable  app for the radiant particles wall paper. not at all was expecting.
B0089VIX60|2.0|Well I thought it would be nice to have another album completely devoted to Iggy's croonings in French. I was fooled!<br />The premise is ok, but what we actually get is a bad selection of songs sung in a caberet-esque manner...not the same thing!<br />Preliminaires was much better than this.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have tried a lot of these remote desktops. This one is nice and feature full. I have tried pocket cloud and it just was too slow on my wifi. Tried this and i feel more responsiveness to it. I do wish the keyboard was easier to pull out then it is perhaps make a menu button then keyboard to turn on then off. Just a thought. Very nice software worth every penny I did not pay for it as it was part of the holiday deal as well. I do recommend this to friends if they need access to their computers from their phone. it can even use your GMAIL account like pocketcloud to identify you. Also lets you log in at windows 7 screen. Just turn on your computer before you leave and this program will let you type in password. Very nice
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author gives an insightful look into his life--his successes, his failures, his beliefs, his struggles.  His near death experience challenges his previous attitudes about faith.  He comes through it with a new vision of life, death and the meaning of reality.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|These books get really redundant.  I had to read something brainier in between each book because I was predicting everything.
B004JHYRAE|4.0|I got this recommended by a friend. It is an interesting perspective. Not as awesome as everybody says but still a good read.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I don't like the layout of the app; i find it not user friendly. i don't think it looks good appealing either. Why do I have to do a search then hit the &#34;web&#34; thing that looks like a rock? Is that the look they are going for? Rocks...I don't get it.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|Nikita is the best series ever. The tapes are absolutely fabulous. I love having the entire series in one compact unit. I bought the first season and I will buy the third season.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It certainly keeps you guessing and is filled with unexpected twists and turns throughout.  But by the end, I was annoyed with the characters and ready for the wrap up.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is one of the best selections that I've read. I often left my own world and entered the story. I caught myself in tears during the ending of the story. I will definitely be looking for this author again. Great read! I would give it six stars if I could.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Best show on TV right now!  Great characters, action, plot and acting - keeps you guessing and keeps you watching and ready for an even better Season 2.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book kept me reading and continuously reading! I couldn't put  it down. There were many stories within each other, not at all confusing, but kept the drive to read on more and more! Very hard to put down!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Possibly it is not Facebook that is the reason for only 3 stars.  What I am not fond of is the way my Kindle Fire displays FB.  I really like it on my laptop.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector has everything you expect from a Jack Ryan series book weaving in the characters and happenings from earlier books with contemporary issues of today. The insight into today's technology with known abuses and potential catastrophes was intriguing to say the least. I especially liked the satisfying way the book ended.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|This movie's humor is so fresh(!), although as with all Sasha Baron Cohen recent movies there are always a few scenes that will go a little over the line. But the rest 90% of the movie is definitely worth watching it.
B008AYA7WE|3.0|Enjoyable ok for a cell phone<br />Don't think you should have yo write a review<br />Ho ho ho ho ho ho
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I didn't expect to care much for this &#34;new&#34; Disney movie.  I love all of the Classics, though, so I thought i would give it a try.  I love this story!  Rapunzel is a princess for the 21st century -- she stays busy while locked in her tower, she expresses complex thoughts and emotions, and she handles herself with grace and style.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Loved it. Was inspiring and gave me a new appreciation for our forces and their sacrifices. Also made me appreciate the sacrifices their families make.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Long hard read not up to usual standards. Will make me think twice about further purchases from this author. Disappointed. Would not recommend!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Quick read. Loved the characters. Enjoyed the little strokes of humor. Poignant message. Especially relevant to those who struggle with sadness and holding onto optimism. Hope the movie reflects the heart of this book.
0061537969|5.0|I have read this book before from the library and wanted others to have it, so I purchased 3 copies for Christmas present. I love this book.

B00AMBH70S|1.0|You should consideer this movie as a very long trailer for the next in the series. Just as a semblance of a plot was about to develop, the movie ends. Previously you had the same old car chases, rooftop chases, and tough guy montage ala Rocky training in Russia.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Interesting view of baseball mgmt and how in depth analysis is superior purchasing a winning team in the free (?) agent market

B005K17RU0|5.0|Nicely laid out, easy to navigate, what more could you ask for. I have found that not all weather apps are created equal. In searching for a quick read on the temperature and if I have to clean snow off the car windows some apps are painfully hard to retrieve this information.  er, my wife tells me I was looking at a stock market app..... sorry. ;0
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like the variety of crafts that are found on pinterest,and it covers a lot of the crafts and recipoes I like
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This if far by the best book I have eve read. All of the romance with them. But after it brings it all back to the beginning what is real and what isn't
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Great service, arrived on time, the product was bought for my daughters kindle touch, she had lost the exact cords. Great product
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was both amazing and sad.<br />I loved it so much & I recommend it to everyone.  Maybe you all will find yourselves falling under Augustus's spell or Hazel's intelligence. Because I have. I have fallen so deeply for these characters, I'm not sure if I'll find a way out.<br /><br />Thank you to Mr. John Green for such a beautiful book.<br />Thanks for helping me make two new friends.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would rate this book 5 out of 5 stars. Without giving to much away this book is amazing. It's full of suspense, humor, murder, and its all around a good read. You fall in love with both Amy and Nick and I promise you won't be able to put the book down. It's only 415 pages but it's packed with such a well written story that won't disappoint!
B00846REIS|4.0|Liked Bared to You:  A Crossfire Novel better than the best seller Fifty Shades of Grey;  felt the writing was enjoyable.

B008MWBY6W|5.0|I have a Tamrac camera backpack that can handle all my camera gear - Canon T4i with a 18-135mm lens, Canon 50mm 1.4 lens, Tamron 10-24mm lens and a Tamron 70-300mm lens, along with filters, batteries, flash, lens hoods cleaning supplies - you name it... I've got it. What isn't easy is when I just want the camera. I decided this might be a good case to try out and I was right. The canon with the 18-135mm fits just right and there is room for a couple batteries and a filter or two in the side pouches. I have to stuff it just right to get the strap in the bag, too, but with a bit of effort it does fit. This will not work as a primary gear bag, but when you just want to grab the camera and go... it's just right. Build quality is good. Not heavily padded, but I feel comfortable trusting my camera to it. The strap has nice padding - not something you always find on budget bags.
B0083V2W6I|5.0|I'm going to see the Who with my Hubbie and this was just what I wanted for him to go with his tickets. Perfect condition classic movie great quality...Thanks!!!
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Very difficult to follow.  The movie is constantly movie at high speed, unlike the James Bond movies of the 1960s.
B00846REIS|4.0|This has a LOT of similarities, but it's got better sex scenes and more equally matched characters. It's an easy read.
B002M9WW30|5.0|100% Excellent, the movies take me back and the extra disk with all of the bonuses is a huge plus!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I have been waiting five years for this to be released and was well worth the wait.  Even though they are getting older they can still jam.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book jumps from character to character quite a bit. So it is somewhat difficult to recall details of each characters situation. But that makes it a very compelling read and I find myself anxious to keep reading to see what happens next.
