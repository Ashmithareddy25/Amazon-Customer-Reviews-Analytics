B000EMGAOY|3.0|I'm not sure what to think about the RHCP anymore.  They started off being like the boyfriend that you wanted to hide from your parents, but now they're more, well, they're more like a boyfriend that you'd want to bring home for dinner with the family. That's not to say that there isn't a good mixture of songs on Stadium Arcadium - there are some definitely strong and catchy tunes and the Dani California video is brilliant, but nothing they've done since BSSM has reached the edginess of BSSM - including Stadium Arcadium.  Flea used to frighten me.  Now he's just endearing.  They still have talent, but they went soft and I miss the edge.
B000DWMN2S|1.0|What version of \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" was R. C Gorham looking at? (The best movie in 2005 you didn't see, May 22, 2006).  I must say, the countryside in this movie looked nothing like Amsterdam and when Jonathan gets off the train at Lvov (or Lviv as the Ukrainians like), it doesn't seem like the Netherlands to me or most viewers.  No stars to the reviewer and 5 for the movie!  I believe this movie has a limited audience, but for those who get it, it is absolutely a must to own and watch over and over.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|I haven't read the book, so I really can't say how accurately it reflects the book, further, I have never been in the military so I couldn't report how accurately it reflects a soldiers life during a war; but overall, as a movie, from a layman's perspective, it was not that good. At times it seemed like it wanted to become something better, and more exciting, but it just never did.  <br /> <br />I think it is obvious this movie was never intended as a war movie in the manner we usually expect, but the previews did not indicate it would be loaded with the hollywood liberal commentary that we have come to expect. I can stomach some of this as long as the movie is entertaining, but it wasn't. As far as the movie is concerned it seems as if it was intended more as a soldier's story with some anti-war social commentary thrown in for good measure, but I am not sure it even succeeds at that.  <br /> <br />I actually wish someone would make a good war movie about Gulf War 1 and leave out the political/social message which, without fail, always detracts from a movie. Not to say this one would have been much better had it been left out, but maybe they would have concentrated on more entertaining and interesting aspects of the movie. <br /> <br />I am not sure about the rest of you, but the previews I saw on TV and the internet clearly gave me the impression this would be an exciting and intense war movie, and not a relatively slow sub-story (that may not be a word, but you get the point) set in the context of the war. Hollywood knows what will get us interested and get us to the theater, this was reflected in the previews, but I believe they played a little bait & switch on us.  <br /> <br />I must say some of the images and cinematography were very striking. This is a strength of this movie, but in my opinion it does not lift it to the level of a \\"good\\" movie or one I could recommend.
0385504209|4.0|I can't get through this puppy. No way no how. I try I try I try. The dialog gets me every time. It's as suave as a shave with a rusty razor on a dry three day stubble, and leaves me about as raw.<br /><br />Even though the plot is exciting, there is something about the style of the writing that puts me off. And I read lots of things, junky novels, classics, sci fi, biographies --good and bad and this is one of the few books I just couldn't even read. That's strange, even stranger because it is a monster bestseller. It may be the style of short sentences that lacks a certain flow that I like when I am reading. Possibly, I'd like this book better in audio form.<br /><br />I suppose the idea of the Holy Grail ending up in France...oops spoiler, is alluring and great for fans of the Grail Myth, but I couldn't get into this book in the least. I could give it five stars for being incredibly bad and STILL earning megabucks and having a film. That, now that, takes talent. What kind I am not sure, but it's a talent.
B000EULJLU|5.0|While the musical style of this album is the polar opposite of Tool's first few albums, it fits in to the way their music has progressed from dark thrashing music, to lengthening tracks, to this; a CD that flows evenly from one track to the next so well, it's a sin to put your player on \\"Random.\\" The easy hits are, of course, Vicarious and The Pot, but Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days combine to become a long, musical tour of darkness. The best word for this Album is Epic.
B00065MDSQ|4.0|4 1/2 stars <br /> <br /> <br />With hardly a misstep, Crimson laid down yet another classic. This band has got to be one of the only few whose history is as consistent as it is long, while throughout the decades retaining the utmost respect for musical creativity, and for that they have musichead's undying admiration. Red pulls all the punches to hoist itself up as a contestant unto that futile  \\"best of K C debate\\". Their bold, menacing warnings from the intro title track epitomized Fripp's potency with progressive rock riffs, where the next two songs concentrated more on songwriting fused with their wonderful jazz influence. The 4th track is the first time we even have room to breath, and while this semi out of place live improv is slow to take off, it certainly is justified to be on this masterpiece album once it is finished. \\"Starless\\" is as good as a Crimson closer is gonna get and wraps everything up in the intelligently brisk experience that time and time again King Crimson provide.
0143034901|4.0|A book that is difficult to describe.  Is it a gothic mystery, a love story, an obsessive quest, or perhaps a coming of age tale?  It is all of these and more. Zafron's descriptive writing style conjurs vivid word pictures that encourages the reader to travel the narrow, winding streets of Barcelona with Daniel as well as to venture into the labyrinth-like passages and dusty shelves of the \\"Cemetary of Forgotten Books\\", where he is allowed to select one book to protect. He reads the book, loves it and begins to investigate what happened to the author and why someone is attempting to systematically burn every book the author has ever written.<br />I liken this book to the times before television when we listened to a mystery show on the radio and let our imaginations take flight. This book evokes the same type of response and lets your mind supply the \\"moving pictures\\".
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|3 1/2 stars <br /> <br /> <br />Beautifully written with less filler, though lacking a certain bite that has driven much of previous releases, this album succeeders brilliantly as a collection of dark rock singles that are catchy enough to engage the most passive listener and complex enough to keep the jaded radio rocker engaged. Homme draws from his seemingly never ending well of creativity and tries to make up for his long running bass player's dismissal with some of his most thoughtful pop melodies to date, which do as result suffer from a lack of connectivity between the band, translating to a glorified solo project. The fact is, whatever Josh Homme is involved in will basically carry his catchy, slowly yet surely progressing ear, and while the latest Queen's album does not compare in spirit with the previous albums, Lullabie is one hell of a (notso)solo gig.
B000002INR|5.0|I bought this album after sampling some tracks here on Amazon and after seeing vocalist, Sebastian Bach, on the VH1 show \\"Super Group.\\" This is a fantastic 80s rock album. Bach's vocals are superb. He's one of the better male vocalists out there.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album for the 80s rock fans. You won't regret it.
B00005JOVH|3.0|This was called the last stand for one reason . The end .period.end of story. Biiig mistake.The movie's main aim was to finish off the  x men movies n be done with it. So the director had 2 turn the story of the x men upside down.Don't get me wrong.This movie has its own set of unmatched graphical effects and superb camera angles n fantastic scenes.  The main plot of the movie was really good.It was original and really blends in with the movie as it progresses.The really exceptional parts of the movies revolve around the visual effects and superb scenes. The director really captured the trademark wolverine n storm as they and every other x men battled the brotherhood. Some new additons like angel and juggernaut were awesome and truly had the comic book feel. (Although juggernaut was not born in australia and angel didn;t get much in the action. Also jugg's costume was [...]).The final battle was really worth watching.    Now to the bad parts .  Now 3/4 of the story revolved around jean grey /phoenix. That was okay if it were in the comic book.But in the movie ,it portrayed jean grey as some sort of vegetable who hardly had any dialogues.True her powers were cool but she jus wasn't really IN the action.Also some very famous mutants die (I shall not say who they are) and it was sin as these mutants are the foundation of x men.    IN a nutshell the movie had exceptional visuals,cool camera angles and battle scenes and a good plot. But as the movie goes on the story takes an unfair turn and moves away from the x men franchise.Instead its used as an excuse to end the trilogy    Normal viewers will like the movie   X MEN fans will deem the movie unfair.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Just read reviewer Kyle Bob \\"tyrone\\"'s comment, and talk about shallow... This brainless reviewer obviously does not understand the complexity of romance, and the emotions and events created by love. All he sees are two guys kissing and making out, and say it is a horrible movie. <br /> <br />Ever considered that maybe it's not that the movie industry, along with everyone else, who have sunk low, it is you?
0393317552|3.0|First of all, read Christopher A. Smith's review of this book.  It is phenomenal.      Anyway, this is an ambitious book with a noble objective.  History, as we know, is written by the \\"winners\\".  And the winners are seldom content to write an objective history, free from editorializing.    The winners want you to believe that they \\"won\\" because god was on their side, or somehow, racially, they are superior to the \\"losers\\".    This book takes on that assumption head-on, and I couldn't be happier about that.      That does leave the question:  why have white Europeans done so well in the world (and more recently Chinese and East Asians), while so many of the world's people have fared so poorly?    How is it that western-civ dominated cultures have put men on the moon, yet \\"primitive\\" cultures throughout the world have barely risen above the stone age?    This book presents several key ideas that, frankly, never occurred to me.  I hate to admit it, but until this book, I was more inclined to say that perhaps the peoples of Western Civ were more advanced due to some inherent advantage that might have been conveyed genetically.    Not all of these \\"advantages\\" are positive traits.  For instance, a very warlike and hostile people will tend to dominate a more passive, peaceloving people.      Could it be that?      I believe that there are different types of intelligence, and that intelligence is highly correlated to genetics.  Is it possible that people with mechanical aptitudes tended to make better weapons than people who, say, were more intelligent in harmonious human relations?    The book throws that all out the window.      Why did Western Civ dominate?  Because it had the largest supply of potential crops, the largest supply of domesticable animals, and a large east-west axis from which this could spread.    Because of this, the populations on this east-west axis (stretching all the way to China), were able to have more people.  More people = more innovation.    The domesticated animals gave these folks more germs, and subsequently, more germ resistance.     The book goes into some detail about these things, but as previous reviewers said, there are basically four macro-factors listed.    It makes very, very good sense.    I found the theory to be very believable and more in concert with my world-view.  (Or at least the world-view that I want to believe.)    So, why only 3 stars?  I felt the book read like a textbook (in terms of enjoyability), but instead of being terse and compact, the prose was rambling and repetitious.      I started the book eagerly and enthusiastically, but after 2 or 3 hundred pages, I felt like I was simply reading the same things over and over.    It managed to strike a bad chord of longwinded and rambling, but decidedly academic in tone.    In other words:  it was a chore to read.    As a result of reading this book, I ordered a copy of the now-villified \\"the bell curve\\" to see if any of the arguments in there are/were pursuasive, especially in light of the evidence in Guns, Germs and Steel.    I would say this book should be required reading for any person who insists that racial superemicy or divine right are the reason why western civ dominates the world today.      At the very least, it is extremely compelling and gives a great, great, solid theory to counter the predestination crowd.

B000002MTR|3.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers is a band worth exploring. This I've learned after 'experiencing' their latest album Stadium Arcadium, which in my opinion is the best album of 2006 so far. Anthony Keidis's unique singing style, Flea's thumping bass, and Chad's excellent drumming is missing one important element on One Hot Minute. That important element is none other than guitarist John Frusciante, who was like an estranged family member during the mid-90's (his drug addiction was a main factor behind his fallout with the band). Frusciante would return to the Peppers on the follow up, 1999's Californication.    Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro replaces John, adding a more rock edged ingredient to the Pepper's spicy funk. As a matter of fact, One Hot Minute is more rock than funk, making it the first and only album where the Peppers dropped their signature funkiness. Okay, enough of the funk talk! Let's talk about the songs on the album.    For the most part, I didn't know what to make of One Hot Minute when I first bought it in '96, when I heard it on and off for 4 or 5 years, and when I had it collect dust on my CD rack for a another 4 or 5 years. Warped, the album opening track, comes bursting out loud and heavy with the an instantly catchy rock vibe before the list of songs come dragging behind: the radio friendly single Aeroplane (a song that might sound innocent until the 'f' word comes blurting out), the Jim Morrison inspired spoken track Deep Kick, the brilliant hit single My Friends (an ode to the late actor River Phoenix), the completely unnecessary and profane Pea, the funky Walkabout, the hit-and-miss ballad (with some profanity) Tearjerker, the dark, hard rocking title track One Hot Minute, and the Jimi Hendrix inspired Coffee Shop.    The album's overall staleness and lack of direction is excused for the most part due to the absence of Frusciante. However, Minute offers some tracks that cannot be missed on a Greatest Hits compilation. The Peppers would eventually go on to make bigger and better albums after Minute, the return to form Californication and the outstanding modern classic Stadium Arcadium with John back onboard. One Hot Minute now symbolizes One not so Hot Minute in the band's career. A minute well worth forgetting.    Track Picks:    Warped  Aeroplane  My Friends  One Hot Minute    Mildly recommended    C-
B00005221M|5.0|This is basically my favorite movie of all time. It has everything that makes a great movie; action, adventure, romance, and not to mention spectacular music. The movie by itself is great but with the great music it is 10 times better, i would definately reccomend this movie.
B000286RKW|5.0|Goodfellas is an astonishing motion picture directed by Martin Scorsese (Cape Fear), and starring Robert Deniro (Heat), Ray Liotta (Hannibal), Joe Pesci (Home Alone), Lorraine Bracco (TV show The Sopranos), and Paul Sorvino (The Cooler).    Hailed as one of the best films in general, and best gangster film in particular, of all time, Goodfellas triumphs with an excellent cast, memorable screenplay, and accurate execution.    Based on a true story, the film follows Henry Hill, played by Liotta in his starmaking role, a young Irish/Italian kid who longs to become a member of the local gang led by the quiet restaurant owner Paul Cicero, played by Sorvino. His gang includes the Irish bred Jimmy Conway, played brilliantly by Deniro, and the guncrazy Tommy Devito, played by Pesci in the role that earned him a well deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar.     Goodfellas examines Hill's rise and fall with the mob, and eventually his abrupt exit from the gang after testifying against the big heads, Cicero and Conway, in a court of law in the early 80's. Today, Hill lives under federal protection.    What makes Goodfellas an outstanding movie is the actual depiction of events that occurred, with all the violence and dialogue, that only Scorsese can pull off successfully with long takes (Henry and Karen's first date scene), and quick jump shots (Henry running errands under the influence of cocaine as the FBI are on the watch scene).    Recommended    A+
B000EPR7NE|4.0|Everything I wanted to say is written beautifully by Kasia S. below (\\"Ancient tapestry of opulent sounds\\"), so all I will add is that this movie is wonderful, but the score is what makes it so.  The 13th track, \\"Chevaliers De Sangreal,\\" is worth the price of the CD alone, and when I heard this music in the movie, I knew I wanted the score - and I also want to see the movie again, just because of the score.  A feast for the ears.  Enjoy.
B00005LC4B|5.0|Cape Fear is one of the best films of the 1990's.    Directed by Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas), and starring his usual collaborator Robert Deniro (Goodfellas, Raging Bull), along with Nick Nolte (48 Hours), Jessica Lange (Tootsie), Joe Don Baker (Fletch), and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers), the film is a remake of the 1962 original with the same title (the original Max Cady and Sam Bowden actors Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck make cameo appearances).    Deniro plays Cady, a menacing ex-convict who upon his release from prison after serving 14 years begins stalking and taunting his former lawyer Bowden, played by Nolte, and his family, wife Leigh, played by Lange, and daughter Danielle, played by Lewis. The reason Max wants to bring terror upon Sam is because 14 years earler, Sam failed to present documents on Max that could have aquitted him from rape charges (Sam realized the grisliness of the crime and decided not to disclose the information).    The film is brilliantly directed (Scorsese integrates his unique style perfectly). However, what makes Fear an extraordinary motion picture is its screenplay, and the star-studded cast (both Deniro and Lewis earned Oscar nominations- Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively - for their performances).    Recommended    A-
1592401791|4.0|First off it's well worth the read.You get inside perspective into the famous Abbey Road studios. The stories of how they recorded \\"All You Need is Love\\" or \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" are priceless. <br /> <br />Geoff certainly was a part of the overall team and really helped with the Beatle sound \\"On the Albums he worked on\\". However, sometimes he simply moved the mic closer to the instrument, which hardly sounds ingenious at all. <br /> <br />People need to remember Geoff was not involved in many of the Beatles pivotal albums and he simply dismisses them. Rubber Soul in feel and texture is every bit the equal of Revolver. Go back and listen to A Hard Day's Night and you will find some incredibly inventive music and why it's my personal favorite all time LP. <br /> <br />Geoff is getting a bad rap from fans for trashing George and Ringo (although he does admit George \\"comes around\\" to become an accomplished guitarist and composer around Abbey Road time) and you know what? The criticism is actually just on many levels.  <br /> <br />Ringo's drumming on \\"I Feel Fine\\" is a good as any drummer's in Rock History and it wouldn't be the Beatles without Mr. Starkey belting out \\"Honey Don't\\" or \\"Boys.\\" <br /> <br />Emerick's biggest fault lies in his ignorance of the excellence of Harrison's early crucial contributions to the phenomenon. The solo on \\" I saw her standing there \\" is among the best rock solos ever. Period end of story. George's Rickenbacker during the zenith of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" - such as the title track where he \\"sprays harmonics all over Lennon's Vocal\\", his spine tingling solo on it or his circular \\"Apparrigio\\" during the fade out. How about his sun records soaked wobbly solo on \\"Can't Buy me Love\\" or his introduction of the volume wah wah pedal on his gorgeous \\" I Need You\\" off of \\"HELP\\"! I could go on and on ( The simple Acoustical Solo on \\"And I Love Her - Brilliant! or his Fender on  Rubber Soul creating the whole Byrds, Flying Burrito Bros. Sounds) howcould Emerick's Golden Ear have missed all these Harrison created gems. Maybe Geoff should've smoked a little of what was going down on those studios? <br /> <br />Yes - Macca and Lennon were the geniuses but let's never forget who's creation starred on the first ever-recorded Beatle song - the 18-year-old Harrison's \\"Cry For A Shadow\\".  <br /> <br />Otherwise, the book is worth the read!
B00000J7JO|4.0|Red Hot Chili Pepper's 1999 effort Californication is one of the band's best 3 albums, the others being 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magic and 2006's Stadium Arcadium, to date.     Reteamed with guitarist John Frusciante, who has proven to be the force behind the band's musical genius, the Peppers, consisting of vocalist Anthony Keidis, bassist Flea, and drummer Chad Smith, deliver some of the best songs on their catalogue: the exciting album opener Around The World, the wonderfully written first single Scar Tissue (featuring one of Frusciante's best solos), the mesmerizing Otherside, the funky Get On Top, the awesome ode to their home state Californication, the hard rocking Easily, the experimental Parallel Universe and Right On Time, and the ear tingling album closing Road Trippin'.    Although the album has its fillers and flaws, Californication is an extraordinary rock album and quite possibly one of the best albums of the past 10 years.

0743454537|3.0|Picoult has a way of detailing in exquisite poetry the kind of pain you previously imagined as beyond description- in this case, dealing with a daughter afflicted by a rare cancer.  She's equally adept at describing the dull ache of life's inexorable progression, be it watching your kids grow up too fast or finding yourself occasionally distanced from the spouse you fell in love with as a younger person.  While reading My Sister's Keeper, I found myself writing down these gorgeously sad quotes that I hope never to have the occasion to use.<br /><br />A problem I had with the story, however, was that there was too much sadness to be believed.  Maybe it's a trapping of Picoult's being too adept at shaping language to match tragedy, but long before My Sister's Keeper's sad ending, the novel seemed to represent an exercise in how much sorrow the author could stuff between its covers.  As if the main plot line of parents who by necessity pit their daughters' health concerns against one another wasn't  sad enough, Picoult fills the story with other grief as well:  son Jesse's acts of rebellion tear at Brian and Sara and jeopardizes Brian's career; daughter Anna's wish for medical independence imperils Kate's health; Anna sues the parents to realize that wish and has to leave her home; guardian ad litem and her sister both suffer heartbreak.<br /><br />The instances of tragedy were outnumbered only by My Sister's Keeper's clich&eacute;s: star-crossed lovers in the form of once rich prep school kid Campbell and former punk Julia; a cocky attorney with a hidden heart of gold; a precocious kid with a lesson to teach the adults trying to run her life (if only they'd listen!); a plucky lesbian.  Too many lives were intertwined, and there were too many coincidences.  Every major woman character was not only one of a pair of sisters, but was also the stereotyped workplace overachiever; even stay at home mom Sara gets to dust off her former lawyer chops in the particularly unbelievable courtroom scenes.<br /><br />The writing was powerful- and the story original- enough to counter those devices, though.  And the clich&eacute;s are countered in large part by pleasant surprises, like Brian's shared love of astronomy with his daughter; and the poignant, too brief  love affair between Kate and another boy with cancer.  All told, readers would mind the heavy burden of pain offered by Picoult in this novel a lot more if she wasn't so good at creating an art form from its depths.  Picoult reminds me of author Pat Conroy, whose descriptions of nature are so beautiful they make me forget my lack of interest in the subject matter; I was recommended this story not for its weighty themes, but for the gorgeous package in which they're wrapped.enes.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|The first thing that surprised me about this movie was the solid acting. It seems like acting is an afterthough in horror these days. <br /> <br />The plot was original. Two Americans go on a backpacking trip of Europe. They meet another chap doing the same thing and he joins them. The trio are on the hunt for beautiful women, and are told another town has a stock-pile of them. The three of them travel to the town where super-model-type women are available by the dozens, and are overly willing to party with the 3 backpackers. One of the men vanishes. Then another. All of a sudden it becomes clear that things are not what they seem. <br /> <br />The film does not become grusome until over half way thru. But when its hits, hold on to your seats. This movie has some of the nastiest scenes ever. Cordless drills, Chain saws, and welding equipment are all used on helplessly handcuffed victims. Blood is everywhere.  <br /> <br />This film will go over well with the Saw crowd. I was fairly impressed with it.
B00005JOVH|2.0|This review is fraught with spoilers because there's no way to express all of my viewpoints without really engaging some of the happenings of the movie.  You have been warned.<br /><br />I have never expected to like any of the X-men movies. The first X-men surprised me with how willing it was to take the time to develop so many different characters, and X2 had enough good action and follow-up character development to make it surprisingly good as well. With the mixed reviews of this one, I figured I wouldn't like it at all. I liked some of it; it exceeded my expectations. But it's still highly flawed and I don't like the direction it took.<br /><br />The key problem with this movie is that it makes the ultimate transition away from what the mutant's powers MEAN to focusing more on what they DO. That means while the writers and Ratner were more than willing to figure out interesting battles, they lost track of a lot of motifs and arcs that could fully encompass the general trend of the movies and make it very good. The driving force behind the franchise has always been the tension between mutants and humans and what to do with that tension, but this one seemed much more willing to give that (and any actual drama) second tier to just hurrying up and getting through all the events that it seems must take place. Unfortunately for Ratner, removing the drama and the point makes the events not matter, which means ultimately a very poor cinema experience.<br /><br />For example, most of the mutants introduced are no longer introduced by how important they are to the main circle and how they help range the debate and understand this new world everyone's entering... mostly they're just introduced as a contrivance to get the plot moving along. I'm definitely not the only one who thinks Angel could have been cut completely from the movie and not changed much. Leech and Phoenix also suffer this fractured character arch, most especially represented by the completely anticlimactic and unnecessarily random ending: The driving force of involving Leech is that he can suck powers away. The driving force of involving Phoenix is that she has an excess of power. Well look at that, don't those two make a great opposites cancel out! Unfortunately, I think the writers decided not to go that route because it would be too obvious... or worse, they didn't even think of it. Whatever the case, they missed a precise and organized denouement to the proceeds, ultimately causing both threads to be mostly spectators to the events as they unfold instead of their supposed function of indicators. In fact, now that I think about it, nothing in explaining who Phoenix is explains why she'd join Magneto like that anyway.<br /><br />This complete lack of functionality is further proof of the loss of focus on what the powers mean. I mean, come on... She's a phoenix, literally. Rise from the grave, more power, passionate... the openness to symbolism and the effect on the human/mutant debate is almost limitless.... did Ratner care? No, he seemed more interested in presenting situation after situation which ultimately proves that we're not even going to pretend Wolverine can die at this point.<br /><br />In fact, for a movie willing to kill off very iconic characters (though, maybe, not really...), it seems unwilling to really understand what killing off those characters will ultimately mean to the remaining mutant characters. Deaths are dealt with with a quick moment of silence and then a discussion of what to do next. There is no grief, or fear, or guilt or anything. What it really feels like Ratner says to his production during these scenes is, \\"All right, the audience already knows what this means to the characters and stuff, no need to linger... let's move on to the next scene.\\" Not only does that suck the drama right out of the proceeds, it also pretty much destroys its pacing.<br /><br />Luckily for it, the movie has some pretty strong moments spattered here and there despite itself. The race between Juggernaut and Kitty was excellent, and for some reason I really started digging the enmity between Pyro and Bobby (even if it did feel like a cheap Star Wars rip-off from time to time). I also loved the imagery around the protesters and the people waiting for the cure, because during that time the movie alludes to famous protests from around the world.<br /><br />Otherwise, the movie was just overstuffed and under-functional. Even the dialog represents that, with Wolverine officially sounding like he's trying to be James Bond, all of the good lines taken straight from different works, some rather redundant lines like \\"And that's why the pawns go first,\\" and so on. I have no doubt in my mind that subsequent X-men will lose further sight of what makes the franchise good, and they're beginning their full decent here.

I have no doubt in my mind that subsequent X-men will lose further sight of what makes the franchise good, and they're beginning their full decent here. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. <br /> <br />--PolarisDiB
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It is sad to see that, while the world is evolving intellectually, some people's brains seem to be de-evolving. <br /> <br />Brokeback mountain is more than a Gay movie. It demonstrate love as an universal subject, which anyone with half a brain can understand. But obviously not you. <br /> <br />My advice to you: keep these comments to yourself, or you will attract many angry letters to come.
B000002MJC|4.0|Many DM fans I suspect bag this album because it didn't follow on in any real sense whatsoever from the previous albums. It's DM moving from the 80s into the 90s and they do it with style, and from the heart. The opener, \\"I Feel You\\" is simply stunning and there are no dull moments, \\"Walking In My Shoes\\" and \\"Condemnation\\" are considerably darker than the usual DM, and \\"Judas\\" is comforting yet haunting at the same time. The closer \\"Higher Love\\" is looking back at the styles they have left behind from a new perspective, The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the version of \\"In Your Room\\" on this album falls considerably short of the single version, as appears on the 86-98 greatest hits album. The song is amazing, but not the way it's presented here.

6305308659|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this relatively unknown film that has themes of racism, McCarthyism and definately pokes fun at the sterile comedies of the 50's like Leave it to Beaver.  Both Toby McGuire and Reese Weatherspoon are excellent as twins who are transported to the world of a 50's comedy (Pleasantville) that they were watching and had a fight over the tv remote.   <br /> <br />The world is in black and white and the people are always happy.  As Witherspoon and McGuire make changes, the people start to go from being black and white to color and some may feel they are destroying Eden (there is even a scene with McGuire eating an apple from his girlfriend and causing a lot of change as a result). <br /> <br />Should not be missed!
B00004VYBC|4.0|This vintage John Carpenter film was made in collaboration with Debra Hill, who with Carpenter was responsible for the runaway success of \\"Halloween\\". When \\"The Fog\\" was first released, it was met with a fairly lukewarm reception. It has since gone on to achieve some acclaim, though it has never reached the heights of commercial success touched upon by \\"Halloween\\", though, then again, few films have.<br /><br />\\"The Fog\\" is a highly atmospheric ghost story. The ghosts manifest themselves on the stroke of midnight, as the fishing village of Antonio Bay gets ready to celebrate its centennial. As the midnight hour rolls in, so does an unearthly fog that begins to engulf the whole town. It is a fog that enshrouds of the ghosts of those whose ship was lured to the rocky coast, only to find itself dashed to bits on the rocks, causing all aboard to plummet to the nether regions of Davy Jones' locker. These ghosts are now hell bent on seeking revenge for their fate on the inhabitants of Antonio bay.<br /><br />The special effects in the film are excellent, as is the musical score composed by none other than John Carpenter himself. This is for the most part a subtle, creepy film, highlighted by a stellar cast. If you are looking for a blood and gore slasher film, this is not the film for you. If, however, you enjoy a terse, tightly written script, as well as a pulse pounding musical score, then you will enjoy this highly atmospheric, ghost story. I originally saw this film in the theatre when it was first released and still remember the effectiveness of the fog rolling across the huge silver screen and the pulse pounding, musical score, which was such an excellent accompaniment to the film. Time has not diminished its power.<br /><br />This well priced DVD is an excellent value with pristine visuals and clear audio. It is a fully loaded DVD that includes two documentaries, one of which was made a the time of the film's release and one made recently. It is interesting to see and hear some of those who were involved with this film as they appeared then and as they look now. One may also elect to view the film in either full screen or letterbox format.and hear some of those who were involved with this film as they appeared then and as they look now.

B00005JLH3|4.0|DrumLine <br /> <br />This is not a movie I would normally choose to watch...  And I'm not really a fan of marching bands and all that...  But this movie was recommended to me by a co-worker, so I gave it a shot.  It was very formulaic, but it was still good.  Maybe it was because I knew nothing about how competitive marching bands could be, but I was actually interested throughout the whole movie.  You really begin to care about the characters as they develop, and of course we are left with a happy ending.   <br /> <br />When you take a chance on a movie of a new genre, you can end up feeling as if you've wasted 2 hours of your life.  This was not the case for me.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who feels like watching a \\"feel good\\" movie every now and again.   <br />
B0006HBZXS|5.0|This is a wonderful film that will keep the viewer totally absorbed. Written by the tremendously talented David Mamet (The House of Games, Oleanna), it is beautifully directed by the noted director Lee Tamahori (Once Were Warriors, Along Came a Spider). The film is a complex, fully fleshed story covering many themes, fully realized by a stellar cast. It also provides the viewer with breathtaking cinematography, as well as a compelling score written by Academy Award winner Jerry Goldsmith (The Omen).<br /><br />The film focuses an a mild mannered, self-effacing, slightly paranoid billionaire, Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins). A brilliant and well-read man with a penchant for esoteric knowledge, Morse is married to Mickey (Elle MacPherson), a young and beautiful, successful model. On location with her in a remote area of Alaska, she is surrounded by her young, fun loving camera crew, while he is seemingly the odd man out. He is astute enough, however, to sense that there are romantic undercurrents between his wife and her photographer, Robert Green (Alec Baldwin).<br /><br />When Morse accompanies Robert on what was to be a short excursion into the Alaskan wilderness, looking for a local hunter to pose in the photo shoot, disaster looms ahead, and the test for the survival of the fittest begins. It is here that the superior mind and knowledge of Morse is put to the test, as they find themselves pitted against nature. Morse rises to the occasion, emerging as a natural leader, while his younger, fitter rival, Robert, is often at a loss as to how to cope in their peculiar situation. It is also through the emerging and changing conditions that they face, that their respective characters emerge. It is in the wilderness that they are both unmasked and emerge as their true selves.<br /><br />This is a film that will keep the viewer enthralled. Anthony Hopkins has never been better as the quietly heroic Morse, and Alec Baldwin is excellent as the craven and duplicitous photographer who has cuckolded him. Elle MacPherson is luminous as the beautiful, young, trophy wife. The rest of the supporting cast, including the giant Kodiac bear, are also terrific. This is a superlative survival story that has something for everyone. Bravo!apher who has cuckolded him. Elle MacPherson is luminous as the beautiful, young, trophy wife.

0316172324|4.0|Our mind, faced with a life threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Narrowing allows to focus. In good decision making, frugality matters. Even the most complicated of relationships and problems have an underlying identifiable pattern. Less is more. Overloading the decision with information makes picking up that signature harder, not easier. To be a successful decision maker, we have to edit. Malcolm Gladwell learns that thin-slicing is doing just that. Blink is about the process of editing unconsciously. The book is a fun read as the writer is a great story teller and is able to translate several research fields to wonderful stories.
0790733226|4.0|Which I thought I might remark to people who complain about the \\"anticlimactic\\" ending. Well what would it be like if the ending has aliens showing Jodie Foster the secret of life the universe and everything and sent her home with a pat on the head? Apart from being quite beyond the capability of even Carl Sagans mind, by showing only the traces of aliens the sense of the unknown is kept. You're kept thinking \\"Oh come on I wanted to see more! What were they really like?\\" Sure you may be disappointed by being given only a little information but if it was all explained to you with nothing left to the imagination the sense of disappointment would be greater. The aliens are kept mysterious to keep you curious. Human beings like to wonder. In effect the viewer (and reader in the case of the book) is given a \\"teaser\\". If it gets you wondering about what's really out there, then I think Carl Sagan has accomplished what he really intended. <br /> <br />Overall I think the book is more thought provoking, but the movie does have good points in the visual effects area. In particular, the 3 minute opening scene showing the pan away from earth, moon, solar system, cometary cloud, nebuale, galaxy to other galaxies and beyond gives a real sense of scale to the universe, much more than simply words could desribe. It's one thing to say \\"billions and billions\\" but to *see* the universe visually is quite another. The scene where Jodie Foster floats down from the sky to the beach world is uncannily dreamlike too. And of course the movie soundtrack is very good too. <br /> <br />Overall a quite enjoyable film, but not quite a \\"classic\\"
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Okay, so I decided to never buy any of the Star Wars DVDs ever because the revamped ones just don't create the same feelings as the orginals did.  The flow was screwed up.  Now this is happening and all I can do is laugh at everyone who bought the other ones.  You supported George Lucas' mistakes and now you want back.  All I'm saying is I will finally, after many years of waiting, throw down some cash to get the orignal movies that have touched so many people's lives and imaginations.
0307277674|5.0|The film, based on Dan Brown's bestseller, called 'The Da Vinci Code' has recently hit South Africa and the criticism it produced amongst the Christians (including the Anglicans, Calvinists, Lutherans, Methodists, Moravians, Presbyterians, and the Roman Catholics) were inescapable. Never in my 18 years of life experience have I come across a film that was capable of creating such hype. Everywhere (and I mean everywhere) I turned, there were comments made on the Eight 'o Clock news on my television set; when I listened to the radio, there were discussions going on with regard to 'The Da Vinci Code' film; and when I opened my newspaper (surprise surprise!) there were articles written on the film. What's causing the hype around The Da Vinci Code? What has Dan Brown written that deserves such criticism and creates such chaos? It was these questions (which I asked myself) that drove me into buying the book. Now for the million rand question, do I accept the fact that my religion is based on lies? I will not comment on that, but what I will say is that I'm very confused. One of the reviewers wrote that \\"there are many truths,\\" and I believe that. I have to believe that.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code starts off with the murder of a respected curator, Jacques Sauni`ere, in the Mus`ee du Louvre (which is an art gallery) in Paris, quickly draws the attention of various people. As the DCPJ (Direction Central Police Judiciare) attempt to solve the mystery of Jacques's death, police captain Bezu Fache takes a gamble and tries to convict Robert Langdon (an American Professor of Religious Symbology and author of several historical books) of commiting the murder. Unfortunately, Robert was living nearby the murder scene, even though he didn't commit the crime. No worries, Dan Brown then intelligently creates a companian for Robert. Her name is Sophie Neveu, who is a DCPJ police cryptologist and also the granddaughter of the deceased curator! They become fugitives (can you imagine the police chasing you?) and as the story moves along, it becomes clear that Jacques was the leader of The Priory of Sion, which is a group (according to Robert's knowledge) who knows the location of a long-kept secret . . .THE HOLY GRAIL. It was Jacques's intention for Sophie and Robert to work hand-in-hand to find THE HOLY GRAIL AND THE SECRETS THAT LIE WITH IT, by following ambiguous and cryptic clues which the curator has left behind. And they must do it quickly, for the murderer of Jacques (amongst others) are on the quest for the same thing. . .chasing you?) and as the story moves along, it becomes clear that Jacques was the leader of The Priory of Sion, which is a group (according to Robert's knowledge) who knows the location of a long-kept secret . . .THE HOLY GRAIL.

B00005JKNF|4.0|There's nothing new I could possibly add to the myriad opinions posted here. It seems everyone who loves Gosford Park has laid out all the right reasons for it (brilliant acting, character development, the 'haves' interfacing with the 'have nots', intellectually stimulating) and those who hate it have cited their reasons, as well (stuffy, slow, tedious, boring). That being said, I will make this short and sweet, for the benefit of those who may stumble upon my humble opinion and are considering watching this film for the first time:    If you like Gosford Park, there's a good chance you enjoy reading, you like playing chess, you are interested in a good documentary, appreciate fine wine and like your sex slow.    If you dislike this movie because you think it is boring and hopelessly confusing, there is a good chance you almost never read (TV Guide and People magazine excepted), you think professional wrestling is real, you think Maya Angelou is a brilliant poet, you prefer Budweiser out of a can and you can't sit still for any movie for more than 10 minutes unless it has violence, nudity, foul language and/or awesome special effects.     Which one am I? Hmmmm....    Hope this helps you potential viewers out there. You know which category you fall into. Now go rent this DVD tomorrow or avoid it like you would a good book.    Oh yeah, this movie gets 4 stars from me.    Peace.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|Let's get it out of the way.  Did Aeon Flux the movie live up to the legacy of its animated version.  Of course not.  It tried though.<br /><br />Over 400 years in the future the remnants of mankind live in one city lorded over by Trevor Goodchild who may or may not be working to save humanity.  Aeon is a rebel assigned to kill him but can't due to strange memories and feelings.  The plot revloves around her getting the answers as to why this is.<br /><br />We'll hit the positives first.  Charlize Theron looks good jumping around in skin tight outfits.  Her hair, while not Aeon's signature (ram's horns?) hairdo, was a decent compromise and actually looked pretty sexy.  Set design and locations were top notch and the special effects were hip.  All the action was pretty action packed and only got completely unbelievable in a couple of spots.  As a sci-fi popcorn muncher, not to shabby.  But...<br /><br />The not so positive aspects may bring you down if you're looking for more.<br /><br />The plot, while passable, would really have been OK as a 30 minute cartoon, but stretched to 90 minutes became monotonous.  Aeon's wardrobe, while skin tight, was nowhere near as racy as cartoon Aeon's.  Its sad that the cartoon could be so much sexier than a live action movie.  What was up with the PG-13 rating anyway.  One of the hallmarks of the animated show was its more adult themes and highly intelligent (and sometimes impossible) plots.  Oh, well.  If you happen to be a fan of animated Aeon then you probabaly love animated Trevor Goodchild as well.  This version is a wishy washy substitute compared to cool animated Trevor.  Some of the acting was a bit under par as well.  In one scene I couldn't tell if Aeon and Trevor were dispassionate about the subject or if the actors themselves were just bored.<br /><br />So, good action, effects and backdrops, but low plot, acting and sexiness.  Worth a viewing but then go back and watch the animated show for the real thing maybe.
B000002I25|5.0|Review no. 271. As most of you probably know,this was a 1967 release as it was The Door's debut album. Still regret never getting to see The Doors play a live concert. Sure, the DVD's and videos are nice, but I've seen enough intense performers to KNOW that nothing compares to a live performance. Especially in the case of The Doors. Tunes here that I'll never grow tired of (sure I'm not alone in this) are \\"Break On Through (To The Other Side)\\", \\"Soul Kitchen\\", their smash hit, that made them a household name in the first place \\"Light My Fire\\", the foot-stomping \\"Back Door Man\\" and the dark, eleven-minute trip into the unknown as \\"The End\\", a time when an eleven minute track was totally unheard of. Put this classic on the top of your current 'want list'. An absolute must-have.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The truth about this album is that it's extremely deep.  In fact, I'd say besides being this band's deepest album I'd say it's the deepest album I can think of right now off the top of my head.  By deep, I mean there are 28 songs, mostly all of which are very strong tracks, and standout tracks in their own respective ways.  I'll try to say something insightful about each track... <br /> <br />Note that I think theres a lot more going on on the second Disc (Mars).  I would describe the first disc as good and the second as nearly mind-blowing, and extremely solid.  <br /> <br />Dani California:  The Mary Jane's Last Dance parallel is uncanny.   When I first heard this song on the radio before the album dropped I remember turning to a friend in the car and saying this sounds a lot like Mary Jane's Last Dance.  Not sure what the deal is here.  I'd say that Frusciante probably heard the Tom Petty song shortly before coming up with the riff and that it was the work of the unconcsious, IF the lyrics and drum beat werent so similar too.  Not sure what else to say about this one.  Its a simple almost folky song with a simple drum beat that sets its tone.  I like the section in the middle where anthony and John sing in unison in real high pitch. <br /> <br />Snow:  This might be the catchiest song on the album and it definately was one of the first and easiest songs to grab me.  Now it sounds to me like one of the poppiest songs on the album.     Sounds to me like it could have easily fit into By The Way. <br /> <br />Charlie:  Strong song, not one of my faves, but I could see this one growing on me over the course of years. <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium:  Very nice, one of the darker songs on the album, sung in a sad tone.  One of the cooler guitar solos on the album.  They use a cool, echoey, almost western-like effect for it.  Everytime I hear it I picture a western saloon for some reason (think Desperado) To me theres nothing super cool about this strack other than that solo. <br /> <br />Hump De Bump:  Fun song, don't listen to this one often, nothing i absolutely love about it right now. <br /> <br />She's Only 18:  This one's the standout of the first disc for me.  One of the best songs on the album.  Arguably the best chorus on the album.  So heavy, a little slow but urgent.  This guitar solo works the best of any track because the segue into the last chorus is seemless and amazing.  Amazing transition there, listen for it, it makes the whole song.  Also love Keidis' playful bird-sounding \\"haha\\" in the middle of the solo.   <br /> <br />Slow Cheetah:  Acoustic ballad, not crazy about the chorus, kind of sounds cheesy to me.  I wish they would have done soemthing more with it.  <br /> <br />Torure Me:  Fast drum beat, decent song, nothing really stands out for me to make me love it. <br /> <br />Strip My Mind:  One of the slowest paced songs on the album.  Nice chorus.  The song works.  What cool is this is a track where the whole band sings in unison for parts of it.  Kinda cool, theres a couple like that i think. Cant imagine hearing this live though. <br /> <br />Especially In Michigan:  I've read reviews on here criticizing this album for it's pointless and meaningless lyrics.  I completely disagree with this and love the poetry thru the whole thing but this song is probably a testamate for those reviews.  Other than making a reference to the Detroit Lions and Tigers (kinda cool), the lyrics dont mean much...but they work, and to me they are just random observations about the state where Kiedis and Chad Smith grew up.  As far as the song goes, to me this is another stand out of the disc.  I love the chorus here.  Its very interesting, distorted and sounds like there might be 2 or 3 voices chanting the distortion, but it might also just be frusciante.  Who knows.  Very cool. <br /> <br />Warlocks:  I dont care much for this one.  Theres just not enough going on with it.  One thing thats cool though is theres a verse in the middle that stands out because it sounds so different (\\"Make a deal with...\\")  Its very cool and sounds to me like something off of Dark Side of the Moon.   <br /> <br />C'Mon Girl:  Arghhhh.  This songs not bad at all, nice guitar riff and a cool baseline, BUT the chorus absolutely bludgeons this one for me.  It just doesnt fit the song, and I'd say it even ruins it for me, making the song almost intolerable.  Wish they would have done something with the Chorus. <br /> <br />Wet Sand:  Heres a song that really evolves and has an energy that slowly builds throughout the whole song.  This is an example of one of many very creative tracks on this album that shows lots of versatility by containing sections that sound somewhat different, or extrapalate on eachother.  The Chorus is amazing.    Theres a point about 2/3 the way through the song right when the second chorus kicks in that is the absolute climax of this song.  Theres a swooshy, space-like sound effect and then the chorus kicks in, but unlike the first chorus, this one has another sound effect thats really cool and continues throughout the entire chorus, underlying everything and changing tone all along.  Its very discreet and you have to listen for it.  Not sure why I love this so much but, just adds energy I think.   Probably something Rubin threw in to add character.  Nice ending too. <br /> <br />Hey:  Not much to say about this one.  Kind of a lame chorus.  Good placement of this song because its successor is one of the stars of the album... <br /> <br />Desecration Smile:  Ohhhh yea, this song is a total emotional rollercoaster.  Its a somber, its joyous, its reflective.  All around just an extemely versatile and well composed piece. It starts out sounding like it's going to be a fluid ballad but about 20 seconds in it takes a drastic turn and the mood is set.  Kiedis vocals here are like nothing we've heard from him before (sung in such high pitch)  He sounds a lot like Neil Young from CSNY times.  Keidis'volcals here are a major and crucial component of this song, but I'd say everything else is as important.  Everyone comes to play here.  Nice picking guitar work by fruciante. <br /> <br />Tell Me Baby:  Another gem on the album.  Totally cool track.  Lots of personality, great representation of this band.  Cool theme about the motives of 20-somethings that move out to LA searching for something they cant even put their finger on.   Nice rapping section in the middle.  Very versatile track, very nice chorus.  Overall extremely solid and I hope this DOES NOT become a single because I would hate for this to be overplayed and I generally steer away from songs designated for radio play (maybe for no reason at all, but I do) <br /> <br />Hard to Concentrate:  I think a lot of people really like this one, and personally I dont get it at all.  Probably one  of the 4 or 5 tracks I might dump if I were forced to cut the album down some.  Nice poem,  too schmoozy though. <br /> <br />21st Century:  An absolute standout for me.  Keidis' vocals dominate the whole song, and Fruciante brings the A-game.  Very dancable song with lots of energy.  Amazing chorus, amazing basework, Chad is solid on the drums, nice guitar solo closing it out.   <br /> <br />She Looks to Me:  Another stand out track for me.  This just works, dont know why i like it, kind of reminds me of early 90's rock.  Contains maybe my favorite verse on the album (\\"down in the south seas...\\")  So different than the rest of the track.  Cool lyrics here too.   I mean really, how much better can the album get from here???  LOTS... <br /> <br />Readymade:   Ohhhhhh man, I mean they keep bringing it track after track on this disc.  One of a handful of total gems on the album.  Hard rocking song from the start, a serious rocker, love the backround \\"ahhhhhh\\" vocals from the rest of the band behind Keidis' voice in the chorus. <br /> <br />If:  sounds like a slower phish song to me.  kind of a reflective song.  Cool electric sound effect underlying the entire song.  I'd consider this the breather of the second disc.  Some might say its a refreshing brake from the insanity and strength of the songs preceding and before they close the album out with another bundle of solid brilliance, others might consider this a break in the momentum. <br /> <br />Make You Feel Better:  Cool song about, well... I'll leave that one up to you.  Love Keidis' periodic \\"oh yea\\" high-pitch scream here.  If he didnt scream it I probably would.   <br /> <br />Animal Bar:  One of the most complex songs on the album.  It does different things.  It moves, it changes.  Grew on me the most.  Love the chorus (\\"rain on my...\\") and the \\"babadaba\\" in the background.  Crazy twist at the end and fizzles out... <br /> <br />So Much I:   how solid can this disc possibly be???  They are still bringing it with variance and full force here.  Like about 20 other songs on the album, this one has its own unique charater and sound thats nothing like the others.  Srong track. <br /> <br />Storm in a Teacup:  One of the gems, love the verse building up to both choruses \\"little lady love youre gonna make some\\"  brilliant structure of words and just well written.  This is almost beastie-boys meets RHCP.  You can hear the Rubin element here.  Energetic all the way through, but certain parts ooze enery, particularly when  it gets real quiet before the last chorus section and to me this sounds a lot like something off Check Your Head (an album i think rubin produced; not sure of this though)  Its got an extraordinary quality to it, great song.    <br /> <br />We Beleive:  Not sure what he deal is with this one, its definately the message of the album though.  I think its the band speaking directly to the album, almost a refleection from them.  I could be dead wrong.  Nice santana-ish guitar effect.  Cool lyrics.  \\"The risk is, it worth it, The disc is, it perfect?\\"  I'll let you answer that one.  Very cool distortion over Keidis' words to fade the track out.  <br /> <br />Turn it Again:  Huge rocker, very loud, led by somewhat distorted  heavy electric guitar.  This one is reminiscent of GunsnRoses for me, particularly toward the end.  Very heavy, very distrorted, similar sound. <br /> <br />Death of a Martian: Def a gem of the album, perfect closer, like nothing theyve ever done before.  Kind of trippy sound.  The song kind of trickles downward the whole time.  Some of the best lyrics on the album.  Very cool ending poem with some of the coolest lyrics I've ever heard in song.  Keidis ends the album on  a somewhat screaming \\"AWAAAAAAAAY\\" love it.  Great song to listen to while you reflect on what you just heard and its sad only because the album has come to an end.  Oh well, time to Turn it Again... <br /> <br /> <br />In closing I'd say there is definitely enough here to keep someone busy for a while and the depth is amazing.   <br /> <br />Thanks.

0743243315|1.0|Initially, after reading reviews by critics and seeing how it was a runner-up of the Man Booker Prize, I was pretty interested in reading this book.<br /><br />The beginning of the book showed definite promise.  I thought that the book was going to submerse me into the world of an immigrant coming to England for the first time, coping with married life and learning more about herself, her limited freedoms and how she deals with her newfound reality.<br /><br />Instead what I got was writing that didn't make any sense to me in many parts of the book, were extremely boring [didn't anybody tire of Chanu's constant philosophical rantings?] and no attachment whatsoever to the characters.  I felt like i never got a clear picture of who the characters really were and therefore i really found myself struggling to sympathize with any of them.<br /><br />As I continued reading, i thought the book would maybe get better--perhaps the climax would be exciting.  Boy was I wrong.  To me, the book was one long really boring soap-opera.  This book totally does immigrant life and adjustment to a new country stories injustice.<br /><br />If you're looking for good stories about immigrants and themes similar to this horrible book, read Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri.  Instead of long, horrendously boring passages that leave you baffled and yawning, Lahiri present picturesque portrayals.<br /><br />This book is one of the worst i've ever read and boy do i regret spending 3 hours reading it.
B000003TA4|3.0|rather than bashing a band I have no vested interest in i would prefer talking about Kurt Cobain's seeming desire to be doing something other than making what he quickly determined was accessible pap. His perpetual mention of groups like the raincoats, kleenex, slits made me think he would have preferred being a woman several years older-doing music much less confining. the joke I suppose is on his fans-who somehow believed  he was speaking for them-
B00005JOVH|1.0|I want my money and my time back.  This was probably the worst comic book movie I have EVER seen.  I would have been happy if they called this movie \\"Stupid Super People\\" or something like that, but it was called \\"X-Men\\" and that is why I hated it.  This is not the X-Men.  I don't know what it was.  Since when is Juggernaut a retarded mutant.  With stupid lines like, \\"I'm the Juggernaut, B***ch!!\\"  He's not even related to the professor, which is also stupid.  By the way, he is NOT a mutant, his powers are MAGICAL!!  Why destroy such an interesting part of Charles Xavier's past?  Everybody knows how much Juggernaut hates the professor.  Juggernaut and Professor X never interact at all.  And since they're not related, why does Juggernaut bother with a helmet?  And why is he so small?   <br />The Phoenix is a being from outer space, not some part of Jean's mind.  When they changed the story of the Phoenix I wanted to walk out of that theater.  Cyclops is not the coolest character but that actor who played his character was excellent, so perfect for the role.  Why would you kill him off so early on in the movie? <br />Where is Nightcrawler?  Where is Toad?  Where is Sabertooth?  Where is Gambit?  We saw Gambit's name on Stryker's list of target mutant in X-Men 2 (an AMAZING movie, great job, Singer).  Why isn't he in the 3rd installment? <br />This movie was terrible, a waste of money.  Somebody who made the \\"Rush Hour\\" movies should never have made the last installment.  I'd give this movie zero stars if I could.  The millions of dollars put into this movie should have been used for a better cause.  Funny, this time last year, Star Wars episode 3 came out, another horrible last chapter to a trilogy.  Deja Vu..
B000AMJDHY|3.0|Panic! At The Disco is getting a lot of comparisons to Fall Out Boy. Yes, they have VERY similar voices. Buts its like someone took away Fall Out Boys electric guitars and put in more dance/disco sounds. I could imagine listening to it at a party! I have mostly all their songs on my iPod and they are very iffy. It really depends on your taste. Some songs are GREAT but some are..well horrid. <br />I Constantly Thank God For Esteban <br />is one of the best songs they have! LOVE IT! <br />Maybe try the CD from the library and see what you think! If you like it..buy it! <br /> <br />If you like more guitar and personal lyrics go check out Fall Out Boys - From Under The Cork Tree. Thats a great CD!
B000E1155E|5.0|Basically to fully appreciate how great this album is you have to be either British or have lived in the UK for a certain amount of time as the songs reflect modern British working class culture VERY well....if you have never experienced these aspects first-hand then the songs lyrics will be lost on you and that to me is the strong point of this record. For example: <br /> <br />\\"Although he might wear classic Reebok's. Or knackered Converse or trackey bottoms tucked in socks\\" - A Certain Romance <br /> <br />I can't understand how a non-British person would understand this reference and how clever it is without experiencing UK 'Chav' Culture with their own eyes.... <br /> <br />My advice, move to Rotheram and you will appreciate this album alot more....
B000001FS3|4.0|It occurred to me while listening to this, the sole U2 recording I own, that had I been a bit younger I very likely would have been a huge U2 fan.  I've always kinda sorta liked them, but the fact was that I was a little \\"old\\" for them.  I hate to admit it, but it's true (and I'm talking more about my inflexibility than my age per se).  I never would have guessed it at the time, but your all-time fave raves are likely to be the groups and solo artists you were listening to at 16 or 17, and I was a bit older than that when I first heard U2.  Well, that's my theory and I'm stickin' to it. <br /> <br />Why that's disappointing in a way is because when I was 16 back in 1968 I was absolutely certain that I would be following trends in rock and popular music for my entire life.  And in fact, it used to kind of bug me that my older siblings seem to think that rock'n'roll died with the 50s.  I thought it was possible to grow WITH the music--to stay, you know, forever young. <br /> <br />But life happens, and your focus shifts. And as much as you like or even love popular music, it somehow seems less critical to stay absolutely au courant.  I associate the Beatles, Stones and the Airplane with my (relatively) carefree and very idealistic teen years.  By the time I was in my late 20s or early 30s, well, it's not true that I had become a hardened cynic exactly BUT I certainly did understand some of the initial criticism levied against the Irish rockers.  Yeah, a little bombastic, a little naive, and yeah, Bono sounded like he was a bit full of himself. <br /> <br />Which, had I thought about it, would have made them the PERFECT band for my 16 year old self.  I forgave the Beatles their occasional pretensions.  I understood what the Airplane was trying to do when they got all bombastic and political--and though I understood even then why their critics carped about their excesses, I still admired their attempt to mix up the political, the personal, the poetic and psychedelic. <br /> <br />Which is basically what U2 was up to a decade and a half later.  And where they still were at (although starting to move away from) five or seven years later when they released this album, which many of their fans consider their masterpiece.  The worst you could say about U2 is probably that they were a little on the earnest side.  But if I could forgive Paul Kantner his leaden anthemns and John Lennon's naive politics (particularly around the SOME TIME IN NEW YORK CITY era), I guess I could certainly forgive U2, who were more tuneful and more lyrically sophisticated than either. <br /> <br />THE JOSHUA TREE is an earnest effort to be sure, but it is as earnest about love and death and all the other great themes, as it is about politics.  Musically, it has a grandeur that more than matches any lyrical grandiosity.  That's probably due in part to the band's increasingly sophisticated musical development.  But also it no doubt has to do with the evocative production work of Brian Eno and DAniel Lanois, two of the bigger names in the biz. <br /> <br />And actually, the lyrics are only occasionally grandiose.  More frequently, they are kind of plain.  It is the arrangements and Bono's passionate (others say \\"overwrought,\\" but I don't) vocals that lend significance to such readymade lyrical conceits as yearning to be \\"where the streets have no name,\\"  still not having \\"found what [one is] looking for,\\" and doing so, \\"with or without you.\\"  Fans might not like it when you point out that there is nothing particularly original in such  lyrics.  Neo-fans such as myself might actually call such \\"unoriginality\\" a kind of virtue.  It takes some considerable fire in the belly to invest such well-trodden tropes with actual meaning.  And U2 does. <br /> <br />The album kept evoking Southwestern desert imagery for me, and I was starting to agree with one reviewer comments (posted below) that THE JOSHUA TREE is something of a Valentine to America (an ambivalent Valentine,but a Valentine nonetheless). <br />It was only after I read the lyric sheet and notes more carefully that I discovered that \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" was inspired by events involving striking BRITISH miners and that \\"One Tree Hill\\" is a New Zealand locale, cited as a favorite haunt of their late friend and employee Greg Carroll a native New Zealander (and to whose memory the album is dedicated).  And of course, the album's closer (\\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\") IS a political elegy to the victims of SOUTH American injustice.   <br /> <br />But somehow, it all seems to relate back to the US.  These Irishmen seem to have their fingers on the pulse of many Americans.  They know what resonates.  And they also know what many young, Americentric kids need to know (\\"just who are these 'disappeared' guys anyway?).  They pull it off with a bit of bombast, to be sure, but also with a fair amount of grace and some real majesty here and there.  Pretty good stuff after all.  Hearts and minds in the right place, I'd say.  And the music supports them.  <br /> <br />
B000ETRCMQ|3.0|I enjoyed this film for it's real acting and how it show the real emotion of the actors. Felicity Huffman should of won besr actress oscar but she did not but she won amny other awards and one day she will win. The acting is top notch from everyone from main charactors to supporting roles. The direction is good. the story is good but it drags at times, it has dsome funny moments that are good. Overall the film is good for it's realnice of humans.
B000006MS3|5.0|Kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth. The Dreaming was underrated when it was first released, but I think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time. This is a superb album, tracks like Sat in Your Lap, Suspended in Gaffa, Leave It Open, Night of The Swallow, Houdini, and Get Out of My House proving this point. There's lots of anger on this album, as Kate put it herself many years ago, and it is her \\"darkest\\" effort to date, but it's pure brilliance! Buy it and be convinced..... <br /> <br /> <br />
0224076051|5.0|I am writing this blurb in reply to Lubos Motl's (you guess it, another String practitioner whose livelihood is being threatened by this book) comment.    The fact that Peter Woit runs a blog critical of String only shows that he is consistent with his opinions. It should shock any impartial observer that in the eye of String practitioners--Lubos Motl being by no means exceptional among String people--this somehow automatically qualifies Woit and his readers as \\"crackpots\\". But what is even more shocking is the comparison to William Dembski's ID blog, because String itself actually provides the perfect analogy to Intellegent Design.    Let me elaborate. At the height of the recent Pennsylvania ID trial, many education experts came forward to defend the theory of Evolution. One of the hotly debated issues was the definition of a \\"theory\\" in science. The ID people, including Mr. George W the Decider, have argued repeatedly that, since Evolution is just a theory, other theories such as ID deserve at least some mention in the classrooms. The defenders of Evolution rely on the rebuttal that a theory in science actually means something that provides the best framework to explain a multitude of independent observations or experimental results and therefore has been accepted by scientific community at large. This, of course, is a lie. String has been paraded as a \\"theory\\" in every physics department for over two decades, and yet not only has it produced no testable prediction but it will almost certainly never be able to do so. This puts String squarely in the company of ID. Furthermore, just like ID has morphed constantly, free of the constraint of experimental confirmation, String has changed constantly ever since its inception. In other words, not only does String produce untestable predictions, but these predictions also change from year to year, often dramatically and in a mutually contradictive way. (Have they settled on the dimensionality of space-time yet? Is it 26,10, 11, or all of the above?)    Other similarities exist, chief among them the religious ferver driving both groups to influence popular opinions and police dissenting thoughts, as exemplified by Lubos Motl's criticism of this book. But there is one big difference between String and ID. The String practitioners are insiders of the science community. They hire their own and make sure String-related papers get published. When a group dominates the peer-review process, it controls the career of every physicist in related fields. It then gains the power to influence, bribe, coerce and intimidate.    Of the five supposedly String supporters in general physics cited by Motl, I have not worked with Gell-Mann, Hawking or Arkani-Hamid, so I don't know what their excuses are (or if they actually need one, since String people tend to misrepresent general enthusiasm for high-energy theories as specific support for String). Prof. Weinberg is the head of a large String group even though he did not publish many real String papers himself. I would certainly count him in the String camp. Dr. Randall made her name by publishing a series of well-publicized String-inspired papers, thus can hardly be called a disinterested  third party either.     The rest of Motl's criticism can be condensed into two simple arguments. The first is that the author does not know details in String as well as he does. This is probably correct technically, particularly in light of the freely changing nature of String's \\"conclusions\\".  But the core message (as well as the title) of the book is not that String gets the details wrong but that String has no details that can be proven wrong (or right). In this sense, Motl's straw-man argument is irrelevant.    The second point Motl made is, \\"The problematic statement that string theory makes no prediction is repeated hundreds of times, and in many particular contexts, such a statement becomes not only boring but also patently false.\\" But Motl did not offer anyjustification why that statement is false. He simply proceeded to throw out more buzzwords and correct more details. One has to conclude that these buzzwords are nothing more than smoke screens meant to obscure the fact no justification could possibly be offered for his claim.    String is a unique phenomenon. It is the most \\"successful\\" pseudo science in modern history. Its catalyst is the unprecedented absence of real experimental input in high-energy physics during the past 30 years. Like a cancer, it turns otherwise worthy members of a formerly proud body into the self-promoting endlessly-propagating automatons sucking all resources dry. Later generations of historians of science will surely make their careers studying this bizarre event. Yet it has not begun. This book is not perfect, but as the first formal effort to recognize and document this historical phenomenon, it is a must read.
B00002MZ12|4.0|I bought this upon release, have played it a lot. It's not my favourite ALanis album, but I like Alanis' music a lot, and I must say that this live album is very nice indeed. The live versions of Head Over Feet, You Learn, I Was Hoping and That I Would Be Good are a joy for the ear, and especially You Oughta Know is wonderful on this album. As for the new songs, I especially enjoy Princess Familiar. The only two songs I do not enjoy as much here are Ironic and Uninvited. I love the originals, but the live versions lack \\"something\\". But in all, a great purchase, and a nice addition to her best of CD The Collection!
B000021XS0|5.0|I don't think I would be doing this masterstoke justice if I gave it one million five star reviews. This is the greatest work of art ever concieved. This CD makes \\"The Wall\\" look childish and inane. But don't take my word for it. In fact, don't take anyone's word for it. Just listen for yourself.
B000BDJ62O|5.0|This collection from 1986 is a very good introduction to her music - it features singles from her first 5 studio albums. The songs featured on this albums show Kate Bush's ability to be very musically diverse: beautiful slower songs like \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\", \\"Cloudbusting\\", and the gorgeous \\"Wow\\", experimental songs like \\"Hounds Of Love\\", \\"The Dreaming\\" and \\"Experiment IV\\", and big hits like \\"Running Up That Hill\\", \\"Babooshka\\" and a re-recorded version of her debut, \\"Wuthering Heights\\". It's a shame that this album only has 12 tracks (back in 1986 greatest hits albums never had any more, I guess), as some other beautiful singles like \\"Hammer Horror\\", \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", \\"Them Heavy People\\", \\"Suspended In Gaffa\\" and \\"The Big Sky\\" didn't make this collection. Glad to hear EMI are planning an \\"updated\\" version in 2006, including all her singles, also the ones released since 1986, like \\"The Sensual World\\", \\"Rocket Man\\", \\"Moments Of Pleasure\\" and \\"King Of The mountian\\". But still, a great introduction to Kate's music, which is well worth the money!
0300108834|5.0|This is currently my favorite audiobook (and I have dozens!).  It is an excellent wee book from the author of the more famous and much longer \\"The Story of Art\\" - now in its 16th edition!  If The Story of Art was written for college students, this one was originally written for school children - although it is more insightful than many adult history books I have read.  It is enchanting, educational and extremely entertaining! (can you tell I like adjectives beginning with \\"e\\"?!) <br />It is also read superbly (by Ralph Cosham) at a pace that people of all ages can easily follow. <br />I therefore thoroughly recommended this book for adults and children alike. <br />If you want more detail, go for JM Roberts' masterpiece (History of The World) a much longer (54 hour) audiobook that is also an absolute classic - but this \\"Little History\\" is the best place to start.
B000AL5OZK|2.0|Agnetha sure know hows to sing, doesn't she? Personally, I like Frida's voice better, but I think her vocals for ABBA were fantastic, and also on this album, she sings very well. However, the songs selected for her first after-ABBA solo album do not interest me at all. Maybe it's because they sound so old-fashioned and somewhat childish to me. I often play ABBA and Frida, but Agnetha's solo work remains unplayed. Too bad, as she's a great singer. I recommend Voulez-Vous by ABBA for Agnetha's best songs. <br /> <br />
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento starring Guy Pearce is such a brainy and sophisticated movie. I wasn't sure what to except when I watched it but I was completely fascinated by this little gem of a film. Leonard (Pearce) suffers from short term memory loss, the film goes backwards, it is not too confusing, just concentrate and you'll figure out the twist ending (I guess that would make the ending the beginning). Leonard takes poloraids of all the things he will forget later on. The film is shot in black and white and color. I highly recommend checking out Memento, I highly recommend checking out Memento. Just a little short term memory loss humor for you, enjoy!
B000BDJ60Q|5.0|This album, released way back in 1978, is one of the best debuts ever. In my opinion, Kate only topped this album with The Dreaming and Hounds Of Love. This album includes some of her earliest compositions, some she wrote when still in her early teens. The Man With The Child In His Eyes is one of the most beautiful songs ever; Moving and the title track are way up with the best of the best as well, as far as I am concerned. It even includes some love songs (Oh To Be In Love, L'Amour Looks Something Like You), which are gorgeous. Her lyrical subjects matters are sometimes unexpected and of shock-value to some, but I think hers are so well crafted.... also, the instruments used on this album are unusual in some cases, but to great effect. I don't like every song on this album (Kite and Feel It don't do it for me), but the inclusion of the best pop song EVER makes up for that: Wuthering Heights. I have never heard anything better since. As for her voice: you either like it or you don't. And I love it.....
B000002BQK|3.0|Mariah Carey's Butterfly album from 1997 was my first record that I did not like from Mariah. Her last great record was Daydream and things haven't been the same since. Now she makes hip-hop/r&b albums. I don't care for those kinds of music styles, I miss her pop sound, her voice was amazing and now it is awful. I don't even recognize her anymore, she is 36 and yet she insists on looking and dressing like a 16 year old. What is her problem? It's time to grow-up Mimi! Her voice is too breathy on Butterfly, her writing is strong here but the way she sings the songs is unbearable at times. Standout tracks include: Butterfly, Whenever You Call, Close My Eyes, Breakdown, The Roof, Honey, and Outside. The rest of the tracks just get on my nerves. I recommend her albums before Butterfly like Music Box or Emotions. Her albums after Butterfly are just ridiculous and bland. Poor Mariah, stop doing songs with Snoop Dogg, he is ruining your floundering career.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|To be honest, this is the first Korn album I've ever listened to. I've always heard thier songs, and even liked listening to some of them, but I never bothered to buy thier albums. The reason I bought this album is because a friend kept telling me how good it was. I was like \\"Yeah, yeah. I'll get around to it\\". That was when this album came out. I just bought it a week ago and I must say that this album rocks! <br /> <br />What made me go an get it was when I watch an AMV of DBZ. The song was \\"Liar\\". After a while I didn't even watch the Vid anymore. I just played it to listen to the song while I searched the web... over and over again. <br /> <br />That's obviously become my favorite song. As for the rest of the album... they're aren't too many songs that I don't like on here. <br />Souvenir had to grow on me because I didn't really like it that much at first, but after listening to it a few times, I started to enjoy it more. 10 Or A 2 Way isn't that good to me, but it's good enough for me to not skip it. Twisted Transistor is a song I do not care too much for. Throw Me Away isn't my type of thing to listen to. I mean, don't get me wrong, the song isn't bad... Its just that the music is a little too dark for my taste. All other songs are good! <br /> <br />Above all, this album is pretty good. Not good enough for a 5 star, but still pretty good.
0195145925|2.0|I found this book rambling, difficult to understand, and not particularly well written.  The main thesis that all that exists is NOW  (see the other reviews for more detail) was not proven in the book and, as far as I can see, cannot be proven empirically (mathematical proof without experimental proof is not adequate).  In my opinion this book's theories belong to the realm of science fiction. If you want to let your imagination roam, anything is possible. Maybe everything is an illusion.  Maybe I am the only thing that exists in the universe.  Maybe there are all sorts of simultaneous universes that are constantly breaking in on each other.  Etcetera.  If I tried hard enough, I could probably support each of these ideas with concepts from quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.  <br /> <br />I don't think it's unusual for theoretical physics to cross the line from science to conjecture: This book is in that tradition.
B000005RT8|5.0|I dont know what is up with the reviews saying this is a bad album. Do not listen to them. This album is amazing! Temporary Secretary is extremely cool and the bonus tracks are brilliant. I love the synthesizers in all the songs. Summers Day Song, One of These Days and Waterfalls are beautiful, heart wrenching songs. Listen to the sound clips. This has to be one of his best albums, if not his best. It never grows old. <br />P.S.- Make sure to buy the CD release UK import with the bonus songs Goodnight Tonight, Check My Machine and Secret Friend. BUY THIS NOW!!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I am a huge PJ fan.  I saw them live last year, and was thoroughly impressed.  When Eddie said that \\"Pearl Jam\\" is some of the bands finest work I never took it seriously.  But after listening through a few times I think that point is validated. <br /> <br />    <br /> 1.  Life Wasted 8 out of 10:  Great opener good guitar bits by  <br />     Stone and Mike. <br />  <br /> 2.  Worldwide Suicide 10 out of 10: Great song overplayed on  <br />     radio. <br /> <br /> 3.  Comatose 8 out of 10: Good song, reminiscent of Brain of J/ <br />     Spin the Black Circle.   <br />  <br /> 4.  Severed Hand 9 out of 10:  Excellent track starts with  <br />     feedback and has great guitar. <br /> <br /> 5.  Marker In The Sand 10 out of 10:  One of my faves on the  <br />     album.  Has an excellent chorus, hopefully it'll be a  <br />     single. <br /> <br /> 6.  Parachutes 10 out of 10: Another favourite, great song to  <br />     mellow out to. <br /> <br />  <br /> 7.  Unemployable 9 out of 10: Superb song great drums by Matt. <br /> <br /> <br /> 8.  Big Wave 6 out of 10: Ok song, has classic Pearl Jam sound <br />     but is pretty much filler. <br /> <br /> 9   Gone 10 out of 10: Super song! another fave great chorus  <br />     and lyrics by Eddie. <br /> <br /> 10. Wasted Reprise 7 out of 10: Album interlude! <br /> <br /> 11. Army Reserve 10 out of 10: Great track has obvious U2 vibe <br />     to it. <br /> <br /> 12. Come Back 10 out of 10: Heartfelt song great lyrics and  <br />     guitar by Stone. <br /> <br /> 13. Inside Job 10 out of 10:  Awesome closer starts out slow <br />     but builds into a great song. <br /> <br /> <br />    <br />      Overall a great album by Eddie and co. I can't wait for  <br />      what they'll do next.
B00005JOVN|4.0|The most notable thing about this remake of the 1970s classic, is its special effects. Not ten minutes into the film do we see the huge \\"rogue wave\\" crash into the ship's starboard side. The crash is utterly stunning, Wolfgang Peterson, master of the disaster film, has once again thrilled with these big budget computer generations. <br /> <br />Not only are the effects phenomenal, this is also a tightly focused action film with characters who while not initially engaging, do grow on you throughout the course of the film. \\"Poseidon\\" boasts many twists of fate for its stars and some genuinely shocking moments, when trapped in a flooded room waiting for a pressure door to open you literally find yourself holding your breath in anticipation, a sure sign of a worthy film. <br /> <br />This well established genre has been tested and works, and why not stick to it? Wolfgang Peterson has chucked out another brilliant slice of entertainment, well worth a look.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Reign In Blood is one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time, along with Master Of Puppets, Paranoid, and The Number Of The Beast.  There is not a dull moment on Reign In Blood, just 28 minutes of pure adrenaline.  On every track, Kerry, Jeff, Dave, and Tom are all trying to play faster and heavier than each other.  The result?  The fastest record of that time period.    When I first heard Slayer, I'll admit that they were not one of my favorites.  I just didn't \\"get\\" Slayer.  Eventually, they won me over.  Reign In Blood hooked me on Slayer for life with its incredibly tight sound.  I can listen to this album 5 times a day because the songs just fly by.  Everything about it is great- the over-the-top lyrics, the talented rhythm combination of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman and their chaotic,incredibly fast solos, and of course, the \\"drum tornado\\" Dave Lombardo.  The riffs in Angel Of Death and Raining Blood are among the greatest I have ever heard.  The aforementioned songs are classics, and the other 8 songs are too.  Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman wrote all of the songs.  The lyrics are about Nazis, killing, Satan, hell; what else would you expect from Slayer?  But to truly understand Slayer -and heavy metal in general- it is necessary to not take it 100% seriously.  If I did, I would think that Slayer was a bunch of criminals.      This album is mandatory listening for fans of \\"extreme\\" metal.  Slayer's sound has been copied by countless bands in the past two decades, but Slayer will always be the best.  I also recommend getting Seasons In The Abyss and Show No Mercy.
B000ASDFJU|2.0|I bought the set for my wife. We both think the show is great. But I was not happy with the paper/cardbord inserts and packaging. Also, starting with the third season, the video is too bright. I had to turn the brightness all the way down on my Samsung DLP TV and it is still a bit washed out.  Some of the disks were scratched.
6305882592|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It has a great theme: live life to the fullest. Although the theme seems obvious, many people do not see right away. It is an absolute must to watch this movie! It is one of the best I've seen.
B000002UY3|5.0|Mazzy Star is certainly my favorite band, so I'm pleased to give this five stars, yet I wouldn't consider \\"She Hangs Brightly\\" my favorite of their albums.  I prefer the consistency of \\"Among My Swan\\", but maybe \\"She Hangs Brightly\\" has the most memorable moments.  This being their first album release isn't bad at all. <br /> <br />The first song I have to mention here is \\"She Hangs Brightly.\\"  It's one of the most trippy, haunting, and mind-blowing songs I've heard.  This is the standout track to me.  It's over six minutes of psychedelic meandering music and vocals.  Hope going on and on about \\"She hangs brightly from the tree\\" with the eerie, sometimes even circus sounding, organ music is quite creepy and mad but still very entrancing. <br /> <br />\\"Halah\\", \\"Give You My Lovin'\\", and \\"Be My Angel\\" are all quite pretty love songs about, well of course, love and heartbreak.  There's a wistful, bluesy sound present in a lot of Mazzy Star music, and this album often presents that mood of longing and despair.  These songs truly capture it. <br /> <br />It's not all sad and downtempo, though.  \\"Ghost Highway\\" is pretty cool.  They pick up the beat here a little more with the drums, guitar, and organ.  It leans more on the psychedelic rock side of Mazzy Star. <br /> <br />I'd have to say the downfall with this album is that it isn't entirely consistent, but still it's an overall good listen.  Even though there is no single bad track here, I still rarely find the ability to listen to this album straight through without skipping over a couple tracks. <br /> <br />I must point out that the album art for this one is great.  The album cover perfectly captures a sense of darkness and mystery, and I even framed the cat illustration that's on the inside.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|This movie was well written and well acted.  I didn't know anything about Johnny Cash nor June Carter Cash before watching this movie.  It gives a lot of insight about Johnny Cash.  Joaquin Phoenix plays the role very well.  He brings out the vulnerability of Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon portrays June Carter Cash as a very strong woman.  The movie really shows that Johnny Cash had a lot to overcome in his younger years.  When he hit rock bottom, June was there to support him and help him through.  Then began the second part of his life when he turned it all around.  He was remarkable for being able to work though his troubled childhood, and she was remarkable for being so strong and standing by him.  It's a true testament to the power of love.  I do recommend this movie.

0553573403|4.0|I bought this book with great anticipation, as a friend of mine recommended his work. I also have an interest in medieval England, particularly the Wars of the Roses, and having heard that the two main families of the book were fictional stand-ins for the two real-life families of the WOTR, I was even more eager to read this.<br /><br />  First, I DID stay up very late to finish it. And that's always a good sign. I did grow to care about the characters and was somewhat shocked at what happened to them over the course of the book. When an author manages to be non-predictable is always a pleasure.<br /><br />  HOWEVER...there are some problems I had with this book that relegates it to my \\"very good but not great' list. First of all, I always have a problem reading fiction that paints characters as \\"good' vs \\"evil\\", especially considering this book is supposedly based upon a real life struggle between the Yorks and the Lancasters of England. I do realize that Martin has given the characters varying shades of grey, but that said, his sympathies obviously lie with one family in particular...at least so far. One of the main female characters (SPOILER) Cersei Lannister, might as well be introduced with fangs and a black cape. And of course what her brother does to one of the York characters is pretty much unforgivable. There is little subtlety here. I read on his website that he is a big fan of Sharon Kay Penman, who is obviously no fan of the Lancasters/Lannisters.<br /><br />  Secondly, I find it hard to take 100% seriously books that have such locales with such blatant, predictable names. \\"Winterfell.\\" Hmm, bet it's cold. \\"The South.\\" Let me guess. It's sunny and hot and people run around half-dressed.<br /><br />  I can also see from a mile away how certain characters will turn out. (SPOILERS) I'd be willing to bet that Sansa, the spoiled, idealistic bride of the-so-very-evil Prince Joffrey, turns out to be one of the toughest of them all. I'd be willing to bet that a certain female stepmother learns to appreciate her husband's bastard son. And of course, the wolves. It's all just a little too heavy on the symbolism for me, a little too obvious.<br /><br />  This is not to say Martin is not a terrific writer, because he is. This book DID keep me up to the very end. I like how he threw in a few curveballs, especially towards the end of the book, but the 'good' characters were just a little too 'good' and the 'bad' ones a little too 'bad.' My favorite, frankly, was King Robert, who was truly very human.<br /><br />  I might buy the sequel(s). Maybe. But I think I've been spoiled by Frank Herbert, whose \\"Dune\\" chronicles had multilayered, utterly believeable characters who always maintained my interest in a world that was fascinating and compelling.<br /><br />  This book is better than about 80% percent of the books I've read in this genre. I liked it. But I didn't love it.e stepmother learns to appreciate her husband's bastard son. And of course, the wolves.

B000F48CD8|4.0|Welcome to the 21st-century's first notable supergroup: The Raconteurs. With members of the White Stripes and the Greenhornes, debut album \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" has a LOT to live up to.<br /><br />And it's definitely a satisfying result -- rawer than the Greenhornes, more expansive than the White Stripes. The Raconteurs turn out solid, rough-edged rock'n'roll tunes and 60s-style guitar pop without leaning too much on any style. No grandstanding, not even a frontman. Just solid, unpretentious rock'n'roll.<br /><br />It starts off with the slow burn and catchy rhythms of \\"Steady as She Goes,\\" which orders you to \\"Find yourself a girl and settle down/Live a simple life in a quiet town.\\" But over the blasts of guitar and grinding spurts, Brendan Benson wails, \\"But no matter what you do/You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell... Steady as she goes, are you steady now?\\"<br /><br />The Raconteurs continue the solid guitar rock for a little while, but it's interrupted by the title track. It starts off as a galloping Middle-Eastern track, and soon Jack White is blasting through the song Robert-Plant-style. It's White's turn to shine, but he soon turns the spotlight back on his bandmates.<br /><br />After that, the band starts to experiment even more: wailing bluesy rock with a lo-fi edge, ponderous bass-rock that seems to be experimenting with itself, claustrophobic whirlwinds, and even a bit of Beatlesy pop with the enchanting \\"Together.\\" The album winds down gradually to a pensive alt-rock note, and you can almost picture the tired musicians wrapping up the day's work.<br /><br />\\"Broken Toy Soldiers\\" is exactly what it appears to be -- solid, enjoyable rock music, without any gimmicks beyond the musicians themselves. Brendan Benson and his bandmates reaffirm their underrated musical skills, and Jack White proves he's more than a talented guy in a red, white and black outfit.<br /><br />Just don't listen to \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" so you can pick out the musical influences. They blend almost seamlessly -- almost because some of the songs lean too heavily one way or another, which makes them stick out of the whole. Not bad, but a little distracting. However, the Raconteurs at their best have a solid, fast-paced, slightly unpolished sound.<br /><br />The music is absolutely exploding with spare instrumentation: flexible electric guitar that can dance, strum or explode, and some equally intense blasts of murky bass. There's a bit of keyboard adding a surreal edge to songs like \\"Store Bought Bones.\\" And finally, Patrick Keeler's drums run under every song, keeping them well grounded.<br /><br />The Raconteurs make a solid debut with \\"Broken Boy Soldiers,\\" with its unpolished, nimble rock sound.

B00008OE4W|5.0|Sneakers is a really fun movie.  It is about a bunch of former crooks who now use their know-how to help companies improve their security systems.  They get involved in a big government fiasco and have to use all their tricks.  It's creative, clever and a lot of fun.  Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, and Sidney Poitier are just some of the actors in this movie.  They all do a really good job and seemed to have fun making the film. <br /> <br />It is quirky, and suspensful and really fun movie.  I do recommend this movie.
0439679958|5.0|This book is great. The reason that I disagree with emily is because she says that the book is predictable and cheesy. But it's not. It's thrilling and the words are so descriptive that they seem to come alive on the page. I think that the character of Richard is quite believable. The twists and turns in this book are great. Okay, so maybe it's not as scary as some other horror books but it's real good. And as for cheesy I don't even know where that came from. It's not like a romance novel or anything. It's completely believable
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Saw, starring Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, and Cary Elwes is an intense roller coaster with twists and turns and hairpin curves. Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) wake up, each chained by the leg to a pipe in a filthy old utility room, prisoners of a criminal called Jigsaw who plays with the minds of his victims by devising tortuous games forcing them to choose between the lesser of two evils in order to live. <br /> <br />The movie transcends beyond a classic horror/slasher flick to become a psychological suspense thriller. Just when you think you've got it figured out, the movie throws another curve ball at you and turns all your suppositions upside down. It's a terrific movie that will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat! <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|The main part of the movie is the plot. Most everyone LOVES Star Wars, so I don't see what the big deal is with everyone rating low, just because they are being babies about the special effects and CGI. I don't see how it can bother you that much, that you don't like the movie anymore. I think the special effects actually add to the persuasion and charisma of the movie, and a new generation of fans will grow because of it. If you are an \\"original\\" star wars fan, as most people are claiming to be, you will stick with Lucas and the new changes, and not be a fair weather friend, as most of the critiquers are.
B000AZLK8Q|3.0|This movie was an attempt to tell the story of how Batman got his start as a crime-fighter. Although certainly well-intentioned, it ultimately FAILS to tell a BELIEVABLE story of Batman's humble beginnings.  <br /> <br />The movie starts out intriguingly, with a young Bruce Wayne studying martial arts with a mysterious sect in the Tibetian wastelands of Asia. But about one hour into the film, things begin to go SERIOUSLY downhill... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />My Complaints - <br /> <br /> <br />Despite several weak attempts at humor, this is BY FAR the most grim and humorless of all the 'Batman' films. The 'oh-so-serious' tone is not so bad during the first part of the film, but as the TEDIOUS moralizing continues, the film comes dangerously close to becoming BORING.  <br /> <br /> <br />The Batmobile is ugly... and I don't mean just slightly ugly; it's REALLY UGLY - it looks like a piece of U.S. military hardware left over from Desert Storm !! The Batmobile is supposed to look COOL and SLEEK and SEXY, not like some hulking monstrousity left over from a construction site ! <br /> <br /> <br />As one other ASTUTE individual pointed out, the fight scenes here are often claustrophobic; it's hard to see who's doing what to whom. In general, several of the fight scenes seem to be POORLY edited. <br /> <br /> <br />Liam Neeson is a fine actor playing a very confusing role. His character at first HELPS Batman, only to betray him later. The motivation for this turnaround is rather VAGUE and (IMHO) unrealistic. Meanwhile, Gary Oldman just looks TIRED in his role as the befuddled 'Detective' Gordon. His character is so meek and ambiguous, it's even hard to tell who's side he's on until near the end of the movie.  <br /> <br /> <br />Christian Bale's 'interpretation' of Batman is RATHER STIFF to say the least; but his portrayal of Bruce Wayne is even WORSE - a rich, pouting whiner with NO CHARISMA AT ALL. As for Katie Holmes, I offer just one word - ANNOYING. <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br />On a positive note - <br /> <br /> <br />Veteran film actors Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both do a FINE job with the supporting roles they're given here - their CLASSY performances (particularly Caine's) ALMOST saved this movie... almost. <br /> <br /> <br />The young actor who played the 'Scarcrow' character was FABULOUS ! He seemed to understand how his role should be played - with HUMOR and STYLE. It's a shame he got so little screen time. <br /> <br /> <br />Some of the photography in the Tibetian mountains and also of Gotham City at night is breathtakingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Overall this movie was a SERIOUS let-down. I went home with this DVD and a HUGE bag of popcorn, expecting to be watching the BEST Batman movie ever, and it just DIDN'T happen. Of all the 'Batman' movies made, Tim Burton's 1989 'Batman' remains by far the most enjoyable of the series. Also recommended: 'Batman: The Animated TV Series' (far better than this movie was) and 'Spiderman,' 'Spiderman 2.'
0553573403|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire is truely brilliant.  Second only to Tolken, and I know how bold of a statement that is.  All four (so far) books in this series are 5 stars.<br /><br />Several aspects make this series outstanding: The characters, the unpredictability, and the harsh realism.<br /><br />The characters are what make this series so good.  Martin writes each book from several characters' points of view.  The suspense is so well done that you find yourself jumping ahead to that character's next chapter just to see what happens.  The characters are extremely well developed, and by writing from their point of view, Martin helps you understand the way they think and act.  Every character is fascinating, but there is a handful that I just can't get enough of (Arya, Tyrion).  Every character is complex--there are very, very few characters that you can categorize as \\"good\\" or \\"evil.\\" Instead, characters are a deep and realistic mix of selfish flaws and good intentions.<br /><br />The realism of ASOIAF doesn't end with the characters.  In most fantasy books, the author will never dare to kill off a main character. This results in no suspense, as you never fear for a character.  This leads to such predictability that it can really detract from a reading experience.  This norm is never farther from the truth than in ASOIAF.  In Martin's books, no one is safe.  Just read Game of Thrones and be prepared to be shocked.  Once Martin shows you he's not afraid to kill anyone, it adds so much suspense to the rest of the series.<br /><br />Everything about these books have an air of harsh reality.  Folks, these books ain't no Harry Potter, and their not for kids.  They describe a dark but enthralling world where violence, incest and rape are commonplace.  But anyone who knows anything about the Middle Ages knows these times were not Disneyland. This adds to the realism and suspense.<br /><br />In the back of my mind I have a fear this series could turn into another Robert Jordan debacle, spanning to 10+ books in the series.  But then I think, I don't care if this series takes 20 books to finish--every book is so absolutely enjoyable that I hope it doesn't end.eries.

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Transamerica is a wonderful small movie resting squarely on the capable shoulders of Felicity Huffman who gives a jaw-dropping, Oscar-worthy performance.  The film succeeds primarily because it refuses to play along with stereotypes.  There is no heavy-handed moralizing, no bitterness, and thank heavens, no over-the-top caricatures (think feather boas and sequined gowns).  On the contrary, Stanley/Bree is simply a woman born in man's body who is going through the difficult, and emotionally demanding, transition; in some respects primarily a matter of re-engineering.  That she must confront the product of her past, son Toby, played convincingly by a surly Kevin Zegers who is at once streetwise, innocent, hard-hearted, and vulnerable, is merely the film's \\"gadget,\\" the premise that gets it off the ground.<br /><br />What comes next is essentially a \\"buddy picture,\\" the unlikely duo head west for sunny California.  Along the way they confront some hard truths about themselves and their respective families, grow closer, and develop a very new twist on the old \\"healing the relationship with the long lost father\\" routine.  The Dodge City showdown arrives in Phoenix where Bree reunites with her estranged parents.  Her mother, played by Fionnula Flanagan, nearly walks off with the movie, (which is saying something), her performance is astounding.  But every minute of this charming and thoroughly likable film belongs to Felicity Huffman whose creation of Bree, a showcase of the actor's art and craft, is both complete and completely winning.  Bree is certainly not splashy, on the contrary, she is the dowdy, turn-of-the-century spinster third-grade math teacher you never had.  She is conservative, staid, reserved, and prim, her mannerisms cautious.  This is less because she is learning how to \\"act like a woman\\" than because it is her actual nature.<br /><br />Most remarkable is how she speaks - her vocabulary, elocution, and tone.  (Re-watch Transamerica and imagine how Ms. Huffman must have labored to get her voice to perform this feat.)  Listening to Bree speak is an unmitigated pleasure, her words are perfectly formed and her phrasing is invariably smart, frequently laced with sarcasm and humor so subtle one might easily miss it.  This is the triumph of Ms. Huffman's work, that in Bree she has created not a freak or a symbol but a person.  One wonders, sometimes, about the courage of really good actors.  Ms. Huffman certainly must be comfortable in her own femininity to take on this role.<br /><br />Transamerica begins focusing on the mechanics of artifice, the \\"props\\" required to create illusion.  Even with their help, most viewers will be struck by how physically unattractive Stanley/Bree is.  It doesn't take long before we find Bree very attractive, it is a beauty born of inner strength.  This is a movie about fighting for honesty and maintaining dignity in the process.  By the end of it you will most likely hope that Bree is able to return to Calvin Two Goats, Graham Greene, and find that most precious quantity - not just love, acceptance for what we actually are.  Highly recommended.labored to get her voice to perform this feat.)

0553801503|5.0|This book seems to set up Book 5 and has relatively little action and not too many plot developments.  Still, the characters are enthralling as usual.  I know if you've read the first three that you'll read this, and although you may be slightly disappointed, you'll still read the next one.  <br /> <br />Besides not having as much action as the first three books, there are a few other different aspects of A Feast for Crows.  Up to this point, Martin stuck with the same characters telling a particular storyline.  For example, in earlier books Theon Greyjoy told the Greyjoy story from his perspective.  However, in two storylines in Book IV (the Dornes and the Greyjoys), Martin weaves the story from a different character each chapter.  For example, he relates the Greyjoy story in 4 chapters through the three surviving brothers and the sister fighting for control of the House.  This was actually a welcome change, although I have absolutely no objection to him sticking with one perspective either. <br /> <br />Other plusses include Martin incorporating the perspective of one of my favorite characters, the warrior-maid Brienne.  And he continues to develop the character of Arya so well that I have to thumb ahead to her next chapter to see what happens.  I also like him writing from the perspective of his most wicked character, Cersei.  At the same time, it's fascinating to watch Jaime transform in front of our very eyes. Unfortunately, there is no Dany in this book, no Jon, and no Tyrion.  However, his rationale how he split up one huge story into Feast for Crows and what will be Dance with Dragons is sound. <br />

B000002LQR|5.0|The Chili Peppers had left EMI records after recording the slightly commercially succesful Mother's Milk with newly recuited Chad Smtih and John Frusciante. After sparking the interest of legendary record producer, Rick Rubin, the Peppers were signed on to Warner Brothers records. They were given a Hollywood mansion to record Blood Sugar Sex Magik in complete seclusion. There they ate, drank, slept, wrote, and recorded (except for Chad who only recorded because he didnt want to live in the mansion because he thought there was a ghost.) Anyways, they made one of the greatest records of the 90's and in my opinion, the Chili Pepper's best record to date. This is my opinion of each song.    1. Power of Equality- A politically driven rap that starts the album off like an explosion. Featured On Tony Hawk's Underground 2    2. If You Have to Ask- A Funky song with a catchy corous with John on his trademark backing vocals.    3. Breaking the Girl- A beautiful acoustic ballad that features the band banging on scrap metal at the end of the song and features superb vocals by Anthony.    4. Funky Monks- A funky song (obviously) with funny lyrics and a good performance by Flea and John.    5. Suck My Kiss- A dirty song by Anthony that talks about oral sex. John's guitar and Flea's bass sound fused into one instrument. You'll see what I mean when you listen to it. Anyways, good song.    6. I Could Have Lied- Another heartfelt acoustic ballad with a great guitar solo by John and superb lyrics by Anthony.    7. Mellowship Slinky In B Major- One of the odder songs from the album. Funny lyrics but a great opening guitar riff.    8. The Rightous and the Wicked- Another political song with a great corous that leads right into the most popular song on the album....    9. Give It Away- This song is perfect in every way. Anthony's vocals are top noch, Johns guitar playing is funky and fierce (with a guitar solo played backwards), a great bass riff by Flea, and consistant drumming by the reliable Chad. Good music video too.    10. Blood Sugar Sex Magik- The title track and mabey the weakest song on the album (how ironic) but its still a great song with a loud courous that will have you shouting too. \\"Blood Sugar Baby, She's Magik, Sex Magik!\\"    11. Under the Bridge- Another masterpiece. A ballad by Anthony about surviving his heiorin addiction. With an awesome guitar into by John. (The end of this song is sung by John's mom and her friends.)    12. Naked In the Rain- Another one of the weaker tracks off the album. Lyrics tell of Anthony's wanting to live in the wild. Still worth listening too. Its better than anything Green Day has to offer.    13. Apache Rose Peacock- A song about seeing a chick in New Orleans. Features odd lyrics but great muscicianship by Flea, John, and Chad. (Flea plays the trumpet in this song.)    14. The Greeting Song- Nice fast guitar playing by John and perhaps sexually oriented lyrics by Anthony. Nice tempo.    15. My Lovely man- An ode to dead guitarist, co-founder, and friend, Hillel Slovak. This is the second song for Hillel along with \\"Knock me Down\\" from Mother's Milk.    16. Sir Phsyco Sexy- Perhaps Anthony's most vulgaric lyrics ever. But it features the best musicianship on the entire album with a nice upbeat ending .    17. They're Red Hot- A Robert Johnson cover song used entirely as a joke and features Chad playing drums with his hands. Ends the album on a good note.    If you dont own this album then I encourage you to purchase it today. This is the best Red Hot Chili Peppers album hands down. If you know nothing about the Chili Peppers and you just started listening to them then this is the perfect album for you to start with. This album made the Peppers one of the greatest bands from the 90's. Whether youre a fan of rock, rap, punk, or disco this is the record for you. Just open it, put it in your cd player, and let the Funky Monks take you on their ride of musical genious.
B0009S3HI0|5.0|I think alot of people are missing the point of this release. If you have most and more of the deftones b-sides and rarities then you might want to keep waiting until there fifth album (unless you just want it for the DVD then buy it used!) For others this is a chance to own some of the rarities besides and outtakes from all of the Deftones past! this album is a great collection for any Deftones fan! When listening to this album it really does give you the feel that you are going through memory lane. My personal fav's (Besides the acoustic stuff) are Savory,If Only Tonight We Could Sleep, & Simple Man! The Deftones are a great band and in this collection you get to see them as a great cover band and acoustic band. As far as the DVD i must say im a little disappointed because i wanted more then just the videos but i am not utterly in distress over this because it does add to the memory lane feel mentioned before! As for some of the songs that are missing there's a reason why they're missing maybe length or the deftones just didnt like them enough for any of them to make it! (Speaking of which as a hardcore deftones fan i would've been highly pissed if they put the boys republic on here,simply for the fact that the boys republic is a treat for the true hardcore deftones fan who bought the Ltd Edition of White Pony) So if you're a deftones fan who wants a little walk through there past up until this very present enjoy!! Kudos to the deftones for putting out a unique collection of B-sides and rarites rather then a half assed collection of greatest hits or so!
0440418569|3.0|I thought the first two books were page turners. I thought the story, the hangcliff endings and the characters were marvelous. In the final book though, I expected more of the tightly woven story to emerge, and yet how various part ends make no sense to me. The sudden sense of motherhood by Lyra's mom, the angel being conned by such a simple tool seems to make the story more unbelievable and leaves a lot of unanswered questions. A disappointing ending.
B000002B35|5.0|Like so many others, I reluctantly and sadly gave up on Pink Floyd after The Wall.  Final Cut is too dismal, and without Roger Waters, how could they possibly still be the true Pink Floyd we all know and love?  I missed them terribly, and I wanted more.  In my bias (and I'm not proud of this), Momentary Lapse seemed more a solo album, or perhaps an offshoot of PF, but not the real Pink Floyd, and I scarcely gave it a chance.  Not long ago, a friend loaned me Pulse, mainly to hear the entire performance of Dark Side (which is excellent).  The other familiar songs were good, too, even the singles I had heard from Momentary Lapse.   <br /> <br />Before returning the CD to my friend, I felt obliged from loyalty to the great years to at least give the unknowns a serious ear.  Randomly, I started with \\"Keep Talking.\\"  To my complete wonder and amazement, here was a true Pink Floyd song, as pure and as enthralling as anything from Animals or Wish You Were Here.  It must be a lucky fluke, I thought.  My second choice was \\"Sorrow,\\" simply because it is long.  Again, I found myself grinning and drawn in exactly like during their prime.  It was wonderful to realize that the mistake was mine.  These songs definitely ARE true Pink Floyd, and taking nothing away from Roger Waters, he is NOT an essential ingredient after all.  So I went back - \\"What Do You Want With Me,\\" \\"Coming Back to Life,\\" \\"A Great Day For Freedom,\\" \\"High Hopes,\\" and \\"Sorrow\\" again (even better the second time).  I felt like I had discovered a rare gem I never knew existed - another lost Pink Floyd masterpiece.  How could I have been so blind and so deaf?  Since 1980, I have thirsted for more Pink Floyd, and here it has been all along! <br /> <br />To those others like me who may have given up on them and have always wanted more, give Pulse a chance.  Listen closely, turn it up, and see if you are not transported to the same place that PF has always been able to take us.  I defy you to hear that little concertwithin the concert and not run out and buy Division Bell and Momentary Lapse.  Gilmour, Mason, and Wright, please forgive my own lapse.  Thank you all once again.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|This Movie was pretty unrealistic.  I can't imagin that the amount of people involved  in the capturing of people to be tortured and killed in the movie would ever happen in real life. It seems the whole town is in on it.  It might have been believeable to have just one or two people in on the capture and torture of tuorists but i can't believe that so many people would condone the killing if inocent human beings...especially the girl who just stands there and laughs as the final boy is captured.   Completely unbelieveable.  The movie made me laugh several times from this.  Could have been an interesteing movie but the lack of character development and unbelievability made me loose interest.  Not to mention the fact that the 3 boys are so annoying and such complete jerks that it makes u not even really care about bad things happening to them.
B000ASAEQW|5.0|While many traditional productions of opera these days look sleepy, either on a stage loaded with so much trappings and clutter, and/or looking as though a group of singers got dropped onto stage and left to their own devices, this is truly a most traditional production, in both all its consummate detail and inspired individual touches.     A certain degree of realism and social commentary inform the August Everding production here. Sarastro's temple is set in solemnly austere design of dark brick and wood, which opens out into a silhouetted relief of what could pass for a Greek temple and also imaginatively to a decrepit looking courtyard, where Tamino faces his trial of silence, which gives us a hint that Sarastro's temple may have seen better days. A certain rigid manner about two of Sarastro's priests also tell us as much (and who are denied their brief Act Two duet).      For the incidents of extra magic that occurs in this production, and that Mozart would have been happy with, in contradicting the cold reason of the Enlightenment, the scenes that take place with the courtyard set just mentioned practically dare you to blink, not to miss anything.  I do not want to give away any secrets here, except that Wolfgang Brendel, as Papageno, in some of the action here, and everywhere, makes up for a few dry spots vocally, by perfectly natural acting of his part. Costumed as a simple warning man or peasant, he works very well, in interaction with everyone else, in capturing the full humor of his part.    Brighter evocations of nature make up very pleasant backdrop for a couple of scenes during the finale to Act Two, for Pamina and the 3 Boys and for Papageno alone, right before meeting up with Papagena in front of a curtain backdrop of a giant oak. The temple, silhouetted before, opens out, suffused with cool light, as Kurt Moll as Sarastro blesses his two new initiates, Pamina and Tamino.    Lucia Popp, as Pamina, is practically enough reason for giving this Zauberflote the highest possible acclaim and for why this belongs in every serious opera dvd collection.  Take for instance her opening of \\"Ach ich fuhls\\" in Act Two, which immediately touches the chord or setting for what the entire rest of the aria will be like, which she continues to sing most expressively.  Her scene, with the three boys is at least equally sublime in making her way from total despondency, despair to joyful anticipation of meeting Tamino again, consummated by her utterly exquisite \\"Tamino mein\\", upon finally greeting him, and radiant demeanor in helping the Tamino of Francisco Ariaza bring the trials of fire and water and their vocal parts to a close.      Her acting matches that of Wolfgang Brendel in their Act One scenes together, in complete believability. Lucia Popp, as many fans already know, was some sixteen years before, a Queen of the Night of classic status on the Otto Klemperer Zauberflote (with all spoken dialogue taken out) for EMI.    Eschewing the least bit of any exaggeration or hindrance to full expressivity of her lines, Edita Gruberova ideally, coolly yet imperiously picks up the mantle Popp had held for the part of the Queen of the Night before, in her musical and dramatic authority in it.  Her sidekick trio of three ladies (Pamela Coburn, Cornelia Wulkopf, Daphne Evangelatos) are as fine vocally and musically, among video choices, as you will find.  While perfectly seductive enough and costumed to be very attractive to the eye, this trio is perhaps a little less menacing than one other out there.    Francisco Araiza, hardly more than a dutiful presence on stage dramatically, and with slight tendency to pout a few more dramatic lines in his part, warmly and elegantly spins out so many lyric lines here, with so much more colorful command of nuance here than found with Peter Schreier on Sawallisch's cd set or his own much drier, less interesting contribution for James Levine on the Met dvd.      Kurt Moll is the warm voiced Sarastro, his voice rolling effortlessly through \\"In diesen heil'gen Hallen\\" and with expressive point both here and the other passages for him. A certain fire about his look or gaze informs even those moments of warmth to convey to Pamina his genuine forbearance in looking out after her. He reappears in the Met Zauberflote dvd eight or nine years later, with undiminished feeling of authority in the part, except for some obvious graying of his vocal prowess and a certain detached manner about him, that had me thinking that all this business with initiates and trials must be incredibly passe or perhaps long by now routinely and terribly de riguer for Sarastro.    Jan-Hendrik Rootering is the ample voiced and authorative Speaker of the Temple, Norbert Orth the entirely black faced and mostly sweet voiced Monostatos, if a little less menacing than one or two others on video by now. Choral forces, including for a properly majestic rendition of and processional up high and stage rear for \\"O Isis und Osiris\\", and supporting cast are all in top form.    I am not quite entirely sure, even after reading the annotation in the well informative liner notes (in nice booklet form) of the changing places between Sarastro's aria \\"O Isis und Osiris\\" and the brief trio with Pamina, and Tamino joining him,that doing this is right, but at least it is well accounted for in the liner notes and may persuade some viewers.    Wolfgang Sawallisch leads a pleasing middle-of-the-road interpreation of this score, levelheaded in almost all choices of tempo and modern, yet supple enough in its simple pacing of so much, yet plush in orchestral sonorities, even with incidences of doubtful intonation from woodwinds.  He is always very supportive of his singers, if not the last word in being imaginative with so much that this score has to offer.      He improves on his earlier analogue set (that has been reissued on cd) in having a more varied cast here, in terms of vocal color, without losing out on issues of diction and meaningful interaction between cast members.  An overriding blandness, sterility both scenically and musically to the Levine/Met Zauberflote on dvd, also on DGG, helps to make the Sawallisch here a clearly preferable choice.    Ultimately, as well supported by Sawallisch, the expert staging here, and the contributions of just about every cast member, humanity emerges as the highest and most prevailing order in society, in place of a clerical, monastic, or even a Masonic one. The complexity of Mozart's vision is as well encapsulated here as may also be the case in one or two auteur productions of this great work.  Here the charm of Mozart's inspiration endures from start - traffic signals both to left and right from a moon-silhouetted Queen of the Night in alt - to finish.

Embittered over the loss of the woman he loved, Corso is cynical, alcoholic and willing to go to any lengths to acquire the tomes coveted by his greedy clients.<br /><br />Corso has been hired by two clients. Flavio La Ponte, whom he considers a friend, has asked him to authenticate a manuscript fragment, allegedly a part of Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers, which was acquired from a publisher/collector who has either committed suicide or been murdered. Corso is also seeking to authenticate another book for Varo Borja, Spain's leading book dealer.<br /><br />Borja has a copy of \\"The Nine Doors,\\" a 17th century manual for summoning the devil. He wants Corso to compare it with two other copies. Only one is believed to be genuine and the collector wants it \\"...by whatever means, and without regard for expense.\\"<br /><br />This dual quest leads Corso from Spain to Portugal and then to Paris and a plot replete with consuming mystery, danger, a bevy of odd characters, puzzles and much talk about books and authors. Along the way he encounters a beautiful young woman named for a Conan Doyle heroine who appoints herself his guardian angel along with characters and events straight out of Dumas.<br /><br />Its bully fun and the completion of one Perez-Reverte only makes me hunger for another.
B00005JOVH|4.0|I've been a fan of X-Men back when they restarted the comic series at the supposed issue #1 with Jim Lee.  This was of course a cruel publicity stunt, as the X-Men had a long history prior to that comic, but it gave kids like me the feeling that I was at the beginning of something special.  The X-Men movies evoke the same feeling of witnessing a mythology in the making.<br /><br />Essentially, mutants are the next evolution of humanity.  Their powers run from the straightforward (Cyclops shoots rays out of his eyes) to the extreme (Storm can control the weather, Professor Xavier is the most powerful psychic on the planet).  Unsurprisingly, the rest of us normal folks are not okay with this and struggle to deal with the burgeoning social, economic, and political issues that arise when a percentage of the population can blow up government buildings by sneezing.<br /><br />In X-Men: The Last Stand, the wheelchair bound Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stuart) leads a school of students dedicated to teaching and refining their powers.  He also runs what amounts to an anti-terrorist organization of super mutants.  They're job is to protect mutant interests, stop other mutants from running amok, and save the world.  The group included Jean Grey (the delicious Famke Janssen), her lover Scott Summers AKA Cyclops (James Marsden), Ororo Munroe AKA Storm (Halle Berry, a little less wooden this time around but not much), and Logan AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, for the ladies) who needs no introduction. With the supposed death of Jean and the disappearance of Cyclops, it's up to Storm and Wolverine to lead a new farm team of mutants into battle.  These newbies include fresh-faced Marie AKA Rogue (Anna Paquin) who can drain powers, Kitty Pride AKA Shadowcat (Ellen Page) who can phase through walls, Peter Rasputin AKA Colossus (the hulking Daniel Cudmore) who can transform himself into living steel, and Marie's boyfriend Bobby Drake AKA Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) who can...well, you can probably guess.<br /><br />On the other side of the spectrum are the terrorists themselves, the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by the charismatic Eric Lensherr AKA Magneto (Ian McKellen, whose very presence elevates the film to high art), master of magnetism.  His minions include shape shifting Raven Darkholme AKA Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) and ex-Xavier student John Allerdyce AKA Pyro (Aaron Stanford). New recruits to the Brotherhood include Callisto (Dania Ramirez), Cain Marko AKA Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Multiple Man (Eric Dane), and a bunch of other mutants known as the Morlocks...at least, that's what they're called in the comics.<br /><br />The two opposing mutant groups are galvanized by the discovery of a \\"cure\\" by the Worthington foundation for mutations.  This anti-mutant serum removes all superpowers, making mutants normal people.  Some people see this cure as salvation, like Rogue, who cannot touch anyone for long without killing them.  Others see it as a deadly threat to their rights to exist, especially after Magneto discovers that human agents carry weapons loaded with the serum in lieu of bullets. Straddling the world of politics and mutant rights is Dr. Hank McCoy AKA Beast (Kelsey Grammer) and long-time friend of Xavier.<br /><br />At the same time, the supposedly deceased Jean Grey has returned and is more powerful than ever. Taking on the persona of Phoenix, she slowly tears up the terrain and the people who love her, eventually falling in with Magneto's Brotherhood.  Phoenix becomes Magneto's secret weapon in an attack on the Worthington facility in Alcatraz.  Yes, that Alcatraz.  Since the serum is created from a single mutant named Jimmy AKA Leech (Cameron Bright), eliminating the boy will effectively stop the program.<br /><br />What ensues is a brute force battle over the San Francisco Bridge as the Brotherhood of Mutants, Xavier's School for the Gifted, and the military (armed with plastic weapons this go round against Magneto's powers; see, humans CAN learn!) duke it out.<br /><br />The good news is that this is the most geeky of the X-Men films, less interested in the mutants making sense for and more concerned with mutants showing off their powers.  Thus we get to see the Fastball Special: Colossus picks up Wolverine and hurls him at opponents.  We finally have Beast doing what he does best, quoting scholarly literature as he beats bad guys up with his feet.  And Storm stops futzing around and electrocutes people. Wolverine smokes cigars and acts like a tough guy. There's even the tease of a Sentinel fight.<br /><br />The Last Stand isn't without a sense of humor. A terrified mother, witnessing mutant powers in full swing, locks the doors on her car. Wolverine, faced with a bad guy who keeps regenerating, finally kicks him in the groin. And Juggernaut quotes the Internet (fans will know what I'm talking about).<br /><br />The bad news is that The Last Stand is essentially two movies collapsed into one.  Phoenix's resurrection and the anti-mutant serum seem to have nothing to do with each other.  Phoenix's presence is unnecessary, and when she finally unleashes her full destructive might, it seems anticlimactic.  Stewart and McKellen aside, the other actors struggle with their lines, especially Berry and Janssen.<br /><br />It feels like this third installment of the trilogy was forced to wrap-up the details of the second film, but midway in production went through a change in leadership so that the new director put his own spin on the movie, creating a schizophrenic quality. Oh wait, that's exactly what happened! Bryan Singer was originally helming this film, and Brett Ratner took over in his stead.  It shows.<br /><br />X-Men's not a deep film, though its premise could be applied to everything from the war on terror to racism to gay rights.  Instead, it opts to be a comic book movie, no more or less than the comic itself: lots of superpowers, a lot of brawling, and snippy asides.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|There are a few things that contribute to the popularity of this movie. <br /> <br />First and most importantly, it is the courage it took to make this movie. Remember, the script of Brokeback Mountain has been floating around Hollywood for ages, and everyone knows about it, just that none has the skills and courage to produce it. Even when director Ang Lee picked up this script, and turn it into a masterpiece, there are still Christian groups protesting it, imagine what happened when they were producing it! (Good thing the filming took place in Canada) <br /> <br />Second, it is the artistic sense required to make this movie. The kind of care and effort required to create the emotions of this movie is extreme. The audiences almost all feel the great sadness and tragedy presented by the movie, yet they come back over and over gain. Imagine the artistic talent required making your audience feel bad for the majority of the movie, and they would still want to come back again and again to watch this movie!  <br /> <br />Finally, this film also demonstrates true talents of Hollywood actors. Almost everyone is sick of Hollywood for filling the movie screen with actors that have pretty faces, but are so shallow that they demonstrate no complex emotion whatsoever. This movie pulled two mainstream actors, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, and allows them to masterfully shine on the movie screen with nothing but their acting skills. Surely this is what the film industry is truly about, not just another rock fest for teenagers. <br /> <br />This is the direction that the movie industry need to strive for, and only with movies like these can we enrich the young minds of society, and give them the correct direction towards life.
0471267554|3.0|I was researching this book on the Author's website. I hope the Author reads this as I am annoyed at the FAQ's listed and the fact that if you want to ask a question, you have to pay $500! Whoa! Well that's kind of insulting to consumers. Who in their right mind would pay $500 for an hour of his time? Not even Atkins charged that much as I called his office and he only charged $175 for an ACTUAL medical appointment, not a vertual or phone one. Greed, one of the seven deadly sins my friend. Either greed or he just doesn't want to talk to people period. Not a good way of getting your point across. <br /> <br /> I am also annoyed at the Sally Fallon rebuttal wasting most of the FAQ page up. This person is not a doctor so who really cares what she says? I took this as a personal issue with the Author best published elsewhere and used the FAQ space as a question/answer place about the diet, like my question of how the Author felt about the link of eating a heavy meat diet to colon cancer, which was not even addressed!  The Author needs to update the website. ca-ripe.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|There is a sweep and grandeur to \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" which gives the movie an instant appeal.  Based on the Jane Austin classic, the scenes move forward at a brisk pace to keep our interest, but it is the portrayals that make the movie continually engaging.    The Bennet family is of small means.  The father, and, particularly, the mother, are interested in seeking suitors for each of their five daughters.  Focus is primarily on Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), or \\"Lizzie,\\" the protagonist, who is treated like the ugly duckling of the five.  She is captivating for her wit and intelligence. We immediately have an affinity to her, for she never suffers fools gladly, and she has the brazenness to confront those of higher standing who may belittle her.  So, the situation is ripe when an aristocrat, Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyed) and his friend, Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), pay a visit to the household.  After some social invitations and gatherings, Mr. Bingley takes a fancy to Jane, her favored elder sister, but it provides opportunities for Lizzie to mingle with the seemingly cold and aloof, Mr. Darcy.  There are many instances when the two meet and work out their desires and distastes for one another.  He regards her as saucy; she finds  him to be arrogant.  Many partial disclosures of his past help to make a portrait of him that she increasingly detests.  There is a diversion when a guest suitor, Mr. Collins, a respectable and scrupulous moral figure, visits the household and forces his affections upon her.  There is also a key crisis when the youngest daughter is taken by a suitor in a situation that may be described as compromising.  Once affections are fully realized, Lizzie is confronted by Mr. Darcy's aunt, the indomitable Lady Catherine de Bourg (Judi[th] Dench).      The new production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has many merits.  The scenes unfold with a grace and movement that is instantly appealing.  Especially the dancing and mingling scenes are choreographed withfinesse.  Similar British movies with great acclaim are sometimes tedious affairs, but this one is winning.  The characters, including the nervous mother, the affectionate father, and the likable Mr. Bingley, are exemplary draws.  The portrayals, especially by Knightly, MacFadyed, and Dench are enthralling.  The novel, which I confess I've never read, is probably followed closely--it would be hard to imagine otherwise--but I don't wish to put up pretenses or consult other reviews.  However, it is easy to appreciate the skillfulness that Austin uses through her mouthpiece, Elizabeth, to confront the attitudes and mores of the upper classes.  Maintaining her charm and dignity, she is able to answer to the impossible standards suitors make upon their chosen mistresses for courtship.  Like \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\" and \\"Jude, the Obscure,\\" which I have read, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" overthrows the mores and conventions of aristocratic arrogance with style and skill.  The movie captures the spirit well.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|I have been listening to Clutch since I first heard of them back in 1996.  Bands like this are very big in the MidWest, and I have to tell you that this is one of my favorite.  I think one of the things that have most impressed me about Clutch is that they have evolved thier music without changing thier musical identity.  I have seen them go from hard core \\"Death Metal\\" (Impetus) to what I can only call \\"Funk Rock\\" (Elephant Riders).  On this album in particular, they have a good mix of bad-@$$ riffs and funky bass lines.  100011 is probably one of the best examples of this.  Most of the bands that I listen to have bad-@$$ riffs and just mediocre lyrics, but Clutch is the execption.  Not only do they sound good, but thier lyrics are fresh and smart (see Blast Tyrant, Easy with that Mic).  Anyways, if you don't already own all of Clutches albums (which you probably don't if you are reading this review), start out with either this album or the self titled album and then go from there.  If you do own all of Clutches other albums, this one is a difinite \\"must have\\".  I like this album a lot better than Elephant Riders and Blast Tyrant, but not as much as TNSL and Clutch.  Hope this helped you out.  Rock on!
B00000634J|5.0|For anyone who remembers John Lennon's early compilation, 'Shaved Fish,' 'Lennon Legend' will undoubtedly provide a great treat.  The songs are selected and arranged far better.  The compilers made a great C.D.--not just a sampler.  The best of 'Shaved Fish' is retained, and some other essentials are added from the second half of his solo career.  Because the quality of his albums is mixed, ('Plastic Ono Band' being a groundbreaking triumph and 'Walls and Bridges' a meandering failure with some key moments), 'Lennon Legend' is a particularly good pick for Lennon fans.  \\"Love,\\" one of his best songs ever and \\"Working Class Hero\\" are aptly added from the former album, but the hits are retained from his lesser works as well.  The listener is also offered his finest songs from 'Double Fantasy' and 'Milk and Honey'.  The compilers (Maybe Yoko had some say?) were wise to extract \\"Woman Is the N----r of the World,\\" a progressive, but poorly phrased song from the first collection and add his rendition of \\"Stand by Me,\\" from 'Rock 'N Roll'.  This addition is good and interesting, but some of echo effects make one believe that Phil Spector's hand left something to be desired.  The album ends with some of his finest work from his early career, including one of the better original Christmas songs, \\"Happy X-mas (The War Is Over)\\".      Some of the highlights include the opener, \\"Imagine,\\" a beautiful anthem that should suit anyone of any creed interested in God and an end to religious and political strife (and faith and servile fear).  There's the classic rocker \\"Instant Karma,\\" an appeal to brotherhood and a favorite song. \\"Cold Turkey,\\" is a fine, but harrowing song done by the man we came to know for his uncompromising honesty.  One of the unheralded songs is \\"Jealous Guy,\\" a beautiful song lyrically, intricate musically, and a departure from the mushy production some of his songs suffered from.  Then, there are the heart-warming moments from his last works.  It is a pleasureto listen to the key songs from 'Double Fantasy' and 'Milk and Honey,' not only for the warmth they retain, but the consolation of knowing that at the end domesticity brought happiness to one of the greatest musical legends of the twentieth century.

6305252572|4.0|48 HRS, a nifty actioner from director Walter Hill, is considered as the buddy movie upon which future films of this ilk would be judged.  Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy certainly had a sharp chemistry in this tale of a veteran cop who \\"borrows\\" convict Murphy for the titular 48 hours to nab a prison escapee and cop killer, played luridly by a young James Remar.  The action is fast and furious and Murphy in his first big screen breakout overcomes his foul mouth with a good turn, especially in the critically lauded scene at the redneck bar.  Sonny Landham and David Patrick Kelly are suitable villains but lovely Annette O'Toole is wasted in the role of Nolte's sometime lover.  However, this is a very entertaining film and shows why Murphy became such a hot box office property at the time.

0307276902|5.0|Oh for Pete's sake. What is all of the hub-bub.  Writers write books and tell it as they see it or feel it or wish it were (or weren't).  Some of the most beautiful and poingnant passages I have ever read (in my 30 years of writing and reading) about the truth and agony of addiction came from James Freys' sweet and honest renditions of what it felt like for him to be a addict. They were real for him and for me.  I understood the addict for the first time in my life and was able to treat my former husband, brothers and others in my life with a new degree of compassion and understanding thanks to James honesty and truth.  So what if he didn't spend as much time in jail or bla bla bla.  I, thankfully, didn't get caught up in all of this and miss the beauty of the book.  And Oprah, shaming him so publically on his \\"embellishments\\" and exagerations! Please!! When she quits having her face, thighs and body air-brushed to make her look thinner, THEN lets speak of mis-representation and exagerations!  I loved  Million Little Pieces. I loved the vulnerable and sweet message that was prevelent throughout.  I take my hat off to anyone who dares to put himself out there only to be dis-emboweled by the self righteous public opinion.  Sail on my friend James (who I have never met)! Don't let them diminish the spirit of your journey or how you chose to relate it. Your book has helped more people than you will ever know. Sincerely, Jeanne Aldrich
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Excellent direction. Superb sets and locations. Average acting but very good looking women. I wasn't expecting much from this film cause I didnt hear a big round of praise for it. However, I felt this film got better with every passing minute. Hostel is an intense tense film. It is probably the most bloody film I have seen but what I liked more about the film was it's edge of the seat disorderly unconscious screenplay. I must say it was worth my time. Watch this film if only you think you can stomach it and not be a short attention span dilletante. This is not like Saw and it doesn't try to be SAW. Is it better than SAW? Despite the difference in genres, NO. Anyway, watch it, forget what critics say.<br /><br />Cheers and two fingers,<br /><br />A much satisfied viewer

B000F0UV0E|5.0|These two voices, which we have listened to for so long....now sing a sad and joyous story of getting old, looking back, wondering if it was in vain....with such gifted harmony and songwriting and musicianship.  The customers who were looking for rock from Knopfler now (huh?) haven't been paying attention or haven't been listening to anything he's done in the last six years.  That includes the Amazon.com reviewer, who completely missed the theme of this album.  These two gifted musicians are singing the story of their lives, and those of us in their generation, of which I consider myself one.  \\"This Is Us\\" sings of when we were young, marrying,\\"stoned on love\\".  Then the music progresses to the hard work of marriage and the struggle of work, the heartbreak of real life. Then,in the middle of the CD. the poignant,magnificent song Emmy Lou wrote and sings that describes to perfection what every parent wishes for her kids--\\"Love and Happiness\\".  When Mark sings \\"Wear your ruby shoes\\" the shivers went right down my spine.  Then near the end, the utter desolation of broken lives as evoked by Right Now and Donkey Town.  Ending with the song about pending death \\"If this is goodbye\\". Breathtaking, haunting....both voices are older now....you can hear Knopfler straining in the upper ranges, but it is that straining, the nostalgia for what has been and what is left that makes this album simply beyond brilliant. If you are under 45 you probably don't understand a note or a word of this CD unless you've got brains and sensitivity.

Her roundabout justifications of purchases are amusing -- because I do know people who think exactly like this. It's the hysterical lines that keep me going back to Kinsella.

0060899190|5.0|For a while I had known about the PostSecret project before I decided to pick up my copy of the book. Now this is not your typical coffee table book (for lack of a better description). PostSecret is the brainchild of Frank Warren who receives anonymous postcards from people confessing secrets they've told nobody about. He's published the best ones on this book.<br /><br />It is impossible to quote the postcards without making the book justice, because many of the items submitted are incredible visual works, yet these three postcards may help you understand the type of material this book is about:<br /><br />-\\"Once I was asked by a doctor if I was hearing voices. The voices inside my head shouted: TELL HIM NO!\\"<br /><br />-\\"I trashed my parent's house to look like I had a party while they were out of town... so my mom would think I had friends.\\"<br /><br />-\\"I give decaf to customers who are RUDE to me!\\" (written on a Starbuck's cup).<br /><br />I highly recommend both the book and the web site. They both are commendable for the work they do to help people in distress to beging to get mental loads off their shoulders.
B00005JN0T|4.0|A murder mystery set in the not-so-distant future forces a young detective to come to grips with his hatred of robots.  Chicago Detective Del Spooner (Smith) has a distrust for machines in a technological era that runs on robots and other thinking machines.  Robots seem compelled to please, and not remotely human looking...until the advent of the NS5.  USR, the Microsoft of the robotic age, plans to unveil (or unleash in Spooner's estimation) the new robots all at once.  With days to go to the critical moment, Dr. Lanning, the robots' sage creator is found mysteriously killed - shattered in USR's vast lobby.  USR rules the death a suicide, but for Spooner it's the case of his lifetime - the first possible instance of homicide by a robot.  As he probes deeper, he tangles with USR staff but finds an unlikely ally with Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, who played something of a cold-hearted automaton as Natasha on \\"Sex in the City\\").  Even as he finbds signs that something horrible is brewing with the new machines, Spooner finds himself putting his prejudices to the test with Sonny, a prototype NS5. <br /> <br />This was a great movie - easily one of those big Hollywood flicks that's better than it has any right to be.  As expected, the flick offers some great CGI scenes, but the movie belongs to Will Smith and whoever he's talking too at the time, whether Moynahan, or Shia Lebouef as a streetwise wannabe-tough guy.  Asimov fans might revolt, but there's nothing here that requires you be a fan of Asimov or even have read any of his stuff.  \\"I'Robot\\" has its share of surprises, even if it often feels as if it was prodcued by robots, but never disappoints.

0143036556|3.0|This is embarrassingly geeky to admit, but I was very disappointed with the book's index.     When I read a non-fiction book like this one, I like to flip to the back and reference the index frequently. It's a function of my short attention span. Usually I do it to find out what happened to a specific person, because I'm too impatient to wait 200 more pages for the conclusion of their story. And it's just a let-down to have a poorly referenced index.    Several listings were incomplete or omitted, and I know it's small, but it's a reflection on the scholarship.     There was no listing for \\"famine,\\" for instance, even though it was a topic that came up repeatedly while discussing societal collapses. The city of Angkor Wat makes it into the index, but only one page is cited - even though it was mentioned in several parts of the book.    I did enjoy many sections of the book, particularly the sagas of Norse Greenland and the Anasazi. But unless you're extremely dedicated, skip the prologue. It's like trudging through a thesis outline.
006072448X|5.0|I read this novel for a book group I am involved in.  The chairwoman had read it and thought very highly of it.  Now I see why. <br /> <br />Reading through the book we are aware what shall happen.  The shock is in the way it happens.  Through the letter's Kevin's mother Eva writes to her estranged husband a picture of Kevin's life before the killings emerges.  The fact that he is almost impossible to relate to and unapologetic for his wrongdoing has us build up contempt for Kevin.  Yet reading the penultimate letter Eva writes made me feel like someone was piling weights onto my back.  The cold intelligence and lack of empathy that Kevin shows in perpertrating his killings is truly harrowing. <br /> <br />Then comes the final letter, which puts such a spin on the rest of the book you will want to go right back and read it again, with a different point of view.  If you're not part of a book group like I am, the best way to read this book is to ask someone else you know to read it at the same time as you.  As I say, you could discuss it forever.
B000AADYYO|5.0|So, another Opeth album. Of course, we are all expecting another masterpiece from these legends, and of course, we get one. Opeth has never released a bad album. In fact, every album, even their mellow offerings recently, have all been \\"epics\\" in my book. And this is no different. Everything Opeth touches is gold, because they are just so talented. Mikael Akerfeldt has the best metal growl in the business. Hands down. Better then everyone who has ever sung for a metal band. Then, his prog, clean vocals are just as good, maybe better, then Maynard James Keenan of Tool. And it is hard to beat him. Martin Lopez is one of the best drummers in music today. His double pedal work is wicked. Martin Mendez is a great bassist. So, you got very talented musicians here to work with. <br /> <br />Opeth is different. Instead of the basic verse-chorus-verse structure, they have ten minute epics with different movements. They have a lot of room to showcase their talent. And with \\"Ghost Reveries\\", they showcased it without flaw once again. My favorite song, \\"Ghost Of Perdition\\", is brutal in the beginning, then when you reach the middle, it is a progressive type sound, which to me is one of Opeth's best songs. Other highlights include...well, the rest of this album. It isn't \\"as\\" good as some of Opeth's prior releases (I emphasize \\"as\\" because it is not by much), but it is still great. They have been great for so long, and they clearly show there is no better band right now to mess with. They are also great live. In other words, they are a force that cannot be stopped... Or are they?  <br /> <br />For this album, they signed to Roadrunner Records. Oops! Yet, they deserve to make a lot of money because they are just so talented. They also deserve a bigger fan base, bigger calling, and greater respect. But, why Roadrunner? Yes, they were the record label to sign to back in the day, but that was the late 80's and early 90's. Now, they sign bands like Slipknot, Killswitch Engage and other metalcore and nu-metal garbage. And not even good metalcore! Some core bands have talented musicians, even though I don't like them. But, the ones Roadrunner signs don't even have musical talent. And, they are screwing with Opeth. \\"The Last Conjuration\\", the first single (and first single of Opeth's career) off this album, was cut and made a video, which was a terrible music video (on metal standards). Are they going to continue this? Is Opeth's next album going to have 3-minute radio friendly songs? Well... <br /> <br />...I like to think positive, but I can't be when it comes to Roadrunner. How do you screw with Opeth like that? I personally think this is Opeth's last epic. I hope this isn't, but I am sure that it is. If the big corporate people start messing with Opeth, I will personally go to Roadrunner and take care of those entire greedy, penny pinching [...] myself...But, anyways, if you are a fan of death/prog/doom, or any metal, get Opeth's entire back catalogue. Then go to one of their concerts. From a music standpoint, Opeth is on top of the world right now. They are untouchable. Nobody is even close. But, from a corporate/musical standpoint, they have some work to do with their record label. I hope they fix this and continue, in the future, to release albums like this one, \\"Blackwater Park\\" and \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\". The moral of the story...get this album now!!!
0743487583|3.0|In \\"Frankenstein,\\" Mary Shelley claims that one needs to be careful at decision because according to the decision awful consequence comes. The main character, Frankenstein, decides to make creature that is similar with human being when he only has shallow knowledge about what he is going to make. Due to the fact that he builds monster with carelessness, he can't handle his beast and the creature kills his youngest brother, Williams. Also, he determines to chase monster when he is filled with rage toward the creature. He can't have proper thoughts about what he comes to conclusion. He follows the monster up to North Pole and dies. However, when he has lots of time to think about the problem and is prudent, he comes to a right decision. He have doubts about his experiment to make female monster and decides to destroy it, because it can be harmful to society. Therefore, not to face dreadful results, individual needs to spend enough time and be careful when he makes decisions.
1400032717|4.0|This wonderful little book is noteworthy not for the story it tells, but for putting the narrative in the voice of a child with autism. With brilliant insight, the author takes us on a ride full of the emotions we feel (which the narrator percieves differently) as we are asked to think the way a highly intelligent autistic person would. This is an unusual book, well worth the read. It is a must-read for anyone with an interest in children with autism.
B0001I562I|5.0|I searched high and low for this movie for a very long time. i saw this movie when i was about 9 years old and i am 29 now. i couldn't remember the name of it until about 2002. i was searching online and really making up names for it until it came on television. and ever since then i had to have it. this movie back then really had my imagination going about the future. but overall i have to have this movie in my movie collection. i love it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|For those who gave this anything but 5 stars - YOU DONT DESERVE TO LISTEN TO IT! <br /> <br />Tool brings us music (or just plain art) from another dimension. It's silly to rate individual songs because that isnt the point.  Think of this as Operation Mindcrime for the 21st Century.  Maynard and Company piece together lyrics and sounds that perfectly tell the haunting story of 10,000 days. Emotionally and intellectually so deep it will shake the very foundation of your life if you truly take it in.   <br /> <br />\\"Vicariously we live while the whole world dies\\"  so true! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004TFRF|4.0|Lynch movies rarely require just a plot synopsis. This film seems more like Lynch is relating a dream than making a movie. However, I have often wanted to see my own dreams on the big screen, so what's the harm in that. Dreams may not seem to make sense, but sometimes they're pretty entertaining. They can also be kind of creepy. That's what Lost Highway seems to be, especially since Bill Pullman has some extremely odd experiences, then he's someone else. I think, of all the Lynch films I've seen, this one is the most puzzling. But I still find its mood engaging and the strange character development entertaining. Lynch fans will enjoy the paths taken in Lost Highway, though the film lacks the potential mass appeal of Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Best Metal band to ever hit the circuit !  Matt Shadow's vocals make my skin crawl and rival the King's ( Rob Halford, ....not Elvis ). Their song structure is phenomenal: a cross between Dream Theatre ,Crimson Glory, Sabbath, Priest and Malmsteen. Synyster Gates and Zach Vengeance are the best guitar tandem since KK Downing and Glenn Tipton. These guys will be the runaway hit of OZZFEST 2006 and RULERS OF METAL for years to come. Wanna scare yourself?  Listen to \\"M.I.A.\\" and \\"Beast And The Harlot\\" then try to think of two better songs you've ever heard.  The bar has been set and no other metal band will ever surpass the mark A7X has set before I die!   Thanks gents!  I Love this CD and all your others.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Ben Stiller transforms himself for the audience in this incredibly funny supermodel spoof. The performances of the rest of the cast are also superb. You really can't explain the humor used in this film without losing a lot in the translation. The film is a refreshing leap out of reality, but maintains order with a well-defined plot, complete with good guys and villains. If you enjoy movies like Dodgeball and Airplane, you'll have fun with Zoolander. It's worth adding to your collection.
B00005JOVH|4.0|I like X-Men: The Last Stand, and yes I'm a fan of the comics as well. I know that alot of fans tore this movie apart saying how they hated the way Brett Ratner handles this installment, and the way the characters are portrayed in the final installment of the X-Men movie Trilogy. Listen, I saw the flaws and guess what... I DIDN'T CARE!!! I found myself enjoying the movie so much that the flaws really didn't matter to me. The only problem that I do agree with that did bother me was the fact that it was just too short in length as a movie. 104 mins is too short for all the elements in the story that were dealt with in the movie. They should've made it just as long as X2, if not longer. 150mins would've been perfect. I especially hate it when people compare \\"The Last Stand\\" to \\"Batman & Robin\\" and \\"Fantastic Four\\".  That really makes me mad.  (Especially towards \\"Batman & Robin\\", because I'm a big fan of Batman as well.)\\"The Last Stand\\" is nothing like \\"Batman & Robin\\".  Ratner didn't \\"bubble gum\\" \\"X-Men\\" to death like Schumacuer did with \\"Batman\\". And don't compare it to \\"Fantasitic Four\\" either. I mean I liked \\"Fantastic Four\\", but I didn't think it was a good movie either. \\"Fantastic Four\\" had no story, while \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" does. Ratner does exactly what I was hoping he would do with \\"X-Men\\", which was to just make it simply entertaining. And he does exactly that.
B00005JKJA|5.0|If I had seen this movie and didn't know it originated with David Lynch, I'd figure it out without being told. It's an interesting challenge to dissect a Lynch film because, really, sometimes there's not really something to find. The film is what it is - strangely presented, but entertaining nonetheless. Pandora's Box definitely opened in Mulholland Drive. Applying that story to a modern situation is intriguing and makes for an interesting film. The character development is excellent, though confusing at first, (the who's who was challenging). There are segments that are difficult to figure out, but that's what makes a Lynch film stand out from other movies. And that's what I enjoy. If you're a Lynch fan, you'll eat up this movie. If you're not a fan, this movie has enough mass appeal and production value to surely entertain.
B000002IGP|5.0|this album is great for any glam metal lover of the 80's, and i was more into the thrash and i liked this. obviously songs like round and round or back for more will get your attention pretty quick, but wanted man and you're in trouble grew on me after a couple listens, along with the rest of the cd. this is good stuff
0670034711|4.0|I really loved this book. (Sorry I didn't give it 5 stars, but I need room to move.) I just found it compelling and honest, and even though the author covers geographical terrain that's been done before - Italy, anyway - she did it in such a unique and well-written way that I honestly started getting cravings for the gelati she spoke about. She wasn't just on a meandering journey across the world - her travels had purpose and intent, and for that reason I found the book meaningful, too. Each of her pitstops around the world - Italy, India and Indonesia - are so different from one another, both in location and in her experience and what she did there. I found her journey fascinating and it did make me wonder how to include more prayer (or at least meditation) in my life.  <br /> <br />
B000002HMH|4.0|this album had some pretty kick ass tracks on there (king nothing, until it sleeps, bleeding me....) yeah they changed their sound a lot, but hey if they didnt you guys would be bitchin about how all their albums sound the same. so go ahead and check this one out if you're a die hard metallica fan, otherwise, you're retarded but this one wouldn't be a great fit for ya

B0007N1AI6|5.0|this is the only judas priest album i have but im familiar with their older stuff and i have to say that this is right up their with any other priest release. my favorite song on this album has to be hellrider. the backing vocals are really friggin cool and rob really brings that song to life. lots of cool riffs and real nice solo towards the end. definitely a good buy.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|As a 35-year old who does not go running to the nearest theatre every time a new horror movie opens, I was pleasantly surprised to find so much to love about Supernatural.  The complex family relationships and glimpses of the brothers' past kept me enthralled, while the one-liners had me laughing out loud and looking for ways to add them into my own conversations.  Horror elements are present in each episode and sometimes they are downright scary, but the real draw is the fine acting by the two young leads.  While Dean and Sam could have been made stereotyped, cardboard characters, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki flesh out their nuances - many times with only a look.  I would strongly urge those who like their family drama mixed with comedy and a little something else to purchase these DVD's.  You won't be disappointed.  Also, check out season 2 on the new CW, Thursdays.
B000002H97|5.0|ive heard so many people say that ohh metallica sold out and i can't comprehend how somebody could actually not like this album. if you think selling out is changing your sound a little bit and making some kick ass music as the result, then yeah metallica sold out, they sold out every night.
B000AP04FG|4.0|I went into this movie expecting to be entertained, and I was - very much so. \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" works very well because of the amazing chemistry between the two leads, the ridiculously good-looking Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The film opens with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith in marriage counseling, and apparently, the magic has gone out of their marriage, probably because they can't speak truthfully about their jobs. They don't know that they are both skilled assassins, but when they are hired to do a hit on each other, the truth unravels. The plot is rather brainless, but I realized about ten minutes into the movie that I really didn't care. <br /> <br />The first part of the film is more enjoyable and successful than the second part, mainly because it's fun to watch the Smiths not realize the truth about each other and then dance on eggshells around each other when they think they know the truth. The dialogue is witty, and filled with great one-liners and double entendres. Take, for example, when John and Jane return home for dinner after trying to kill each other, and John says, in response to Jane's question of why he has returned early from his so-called business trip, \\"I missed you.\\" She replies, matter-of-factly, \\"I missed you, too.\\" The movie is often very funny, although most laughs come from when they're doing generic couple stuff (like seeing a counselor, eating dinner at home, brushing their teeth, etc.). <br /> <br />\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" relies mostly on the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, and they have that in spades. The sex appeal literally explodes off the screen, and I wish the film spent more time laboring over the couple-stuff they do and not so much the explosions and action. Jolie has never looked better or more hypnotically beautiful than in this movie, and it's pretty obvious why Pitt's character falls for her almost instantly. I also thought that Jolie was great at making her Jane Smith character a real person; she brings a quietpoignancy to the role. As John Smith, Pitt is wickedly funny and excellent. He gets all the best lines. In the hands of a lesser actor, his lines would sometimes seem corny, but Pitt makes his character believable and extremely likable. The supporting characters (played by Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, and Vince Vaughn) seem a bit wasted, but this is, after all, the Brad and Angelina show. <br /> <br />My main problem with the film is the excessive (and often plodding) action scenes. While it is fun to watch Pitt and Jolie look sexy while doing cool stunts, it gets tiring pretty quickly. This is the primary reason that the last thirty minutes or so of the film aren't as witty or entertaining as the earlier moments in the film. I think the movie could have been improved if there were less physical explosions and mindless action and more of the explosive chemistry in the quieter scenes between Pitt and Jolie. <br /> <br />Despite its flaws, \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is a wonderful way to spend two hours at the theatre. Not a movie for anyone demanding a real plot or serious depth, but worth a rental, at least. 4/5.
0671027344|5.0|As many others have said here, I couldn't put this book down. I truly felt like I cared about Charlie and his friends, hoping they'd make it through this tumultuous time in their lives, especially Charlie himself. He's one you can truly sympathize with and makes one realize how sweet it is how much love he has for Sam. It truly makes sense in real life, as well as in fiction, how this story plays out and it doesn't feel forced like a drama on tv. It unfolds naturally and without the normal \\"happy ending\\". It's life, a true life of a troubled teenager with things to deal with from the past, as well as the present and the future. This book really made me think and all the music references, once i listened to a few of them, really made me feel like i know Charlie personally from his choices. This book just really captivated until the end, when Charlie has to face his sophmore year differently, older and wiser than when he first started high school. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for anyone who wants an honest, heartfelt read by a very talented writer. This is near the top of my list.
1594200823|4.0|\\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" is great for people who care enough about their bodies, their food, and the planet already that such pop phenomena as the Atkins diet and \\"Fast Food Nation\\" seem somewhat facile.  Rather than the standard organic horror-show diatribe against well-known (and ignored anyway) cruelties like too many chickens in too little space, Pollan presents the big picture behind many, many small food decisions we make every time we eat. <br /> <br />It's a beautiful book, admirably original in its conception.  It loses a star for polemics, which first reared their heads when Pollan described a corn field as though it was a strip mall parking lot full of SUVs -- that is, the ugliest place on Earth.  I find farmland really lovely, and though I understand that Pollan was just trying to paint corn as the bad guy, he occasionally goes a bit too far to make a point. <br /> <br />Though it is not the intent of the book, everyone I know who has read \\"Dilemma\\" is losing weight, because they actually think about everything they're putting in their mouths a bit more.  In the overfed U.S., we could all stand some more of that.
B00006V9A0|3.0|This is a decent compilation. I am of the mind that compilations, by nature, are evil. Even so, this CD would be a nice jumping-off point for someone unfamiliar with the band. There are a lot of great songs on here, but there are also a lot of great songs that you're missing out on if this is all you have from Nirvana. <br /> <br />You could buy this CD, it's not really a bad purchase. I'd just assume go buy the individual albums though.

1400079179|5.0|Two weeks ago I saw the movie and enjoyed it so much I began reading Diane's copy of this fabulous book.  I know, I know that by describing it as such I am baring my chest to all those \\"superior\\" intellects that have splashed the Amazon reader comment's screens with bucketfuls of offal to be splashed on us, the unwashed masses, who love the book as I do.  The religious extremists pounce on their fact that the book reproduces old historical material under new and incorrect interpretations; the literature people love telling readers how bad Brown writes, that his book \\"appeals to the lowest common denominator\\" and some historians just damn it by saying his research is wrong.  Rubbish-the book exceeds in doing exactly what it sets out to do-tell a riviting story about something besides gangsters or international crime and succeeds magnificently.<br /><br />I have trawled through a number of volumes about Early Christian history, the Cathars, the Gnostics, ancient history in general, late Roman sects-in short a few subjects touched on by Brown and I found his information both credible and beautifully managed.  I must praise him for stitching together so many esoteric patches and making the resulting beautiful quilt.<br /><br />I admit to knowing next to nothing about the symbolism that plays such a remarkably strong role throughout the book. His whole tact regarding the male-female symbols and their replication as the Star of David in one form and the Louvre's pyramids as another was new to me.  I repeat myself when I say how impressive was his blending of so many bits of information that are deeply ingrained but buried in western history.<br /><br />His chapters beginning with 55 and continuing through 61 are the core of the book's premise and, I think, constitute the reasons why some Christians feel outraged and feel that Brown's work is old fashionably blasphemous.  And yes, given their premises, they are correct.<br /><br />Thank the fates we do not live in their circumscribed world.n their circumscribed world.    <br />    <br />  <br />  <br />

Yesterday night, I just watched the film. I liked the film too, but it was not nearly as enjoyable as this classic novel. The story is presented well and is uncut. This is the version of the book to get.

B00005JO9J|3.0|I began this short first season of Grey's Anatomy with confusion.  Was it a comedy program, was it a drama, was it the clich&eacute; dramedy, or was it simply another television program attempting to bite what little piece of the ER pie there was still remaining?  It feels as if a network cannot be successful unless they staple their nightly lineup with either a lawyer-based program, or a medical drama.  With Grey's Anatomy on ABC, Scrubs on NBC, and ER still on NBC, one could probably get their own medical degree by simply watching prime time television.  Either way, Grey's Anatomy is your clich&eacute; addictive dramedy that is not quite as original as Scrubs and not to the emotional level that ER attempts to consistently be at.  It is, simply put, bland, but addictive.<br /><br />Grey's Anatomy reminds me of a bag of Cheetos.  As you open the bag, a gust of overwhelming smells enters your body.  You assume that what you are about to eat is going to be the greatest taste sensation to enter your mouth.  This could be equated to the opening scenes of Grey's Anatomy, but as you begin to chow down on those cheesy corporate made morsels, you discover that they taste just like everything else that you have ever eaten, and leave nothing more than bad breath and a orange powder on your fingers.  Yet, here is where Grey's Anatomy finally gets you.  Grey's Anatomy is the orange powder on your fingers that you cannot help but continually lick off, instead of just rinsing clean.  While the characters are clich&eacute; and seen in every television program created (the trailer park girl who worked her way to the top, the insecure boy, the jock, the over-achiever, and the \\"regular\\" middle-ground character), the story surrounding Grey's Anatomy will make you want to watch another episode after another episode, devouring every drop of orange powder, instead of simply washing it off.<br /><br />Grey's Anatomy is a painful show.  There are characters that you will love (the \\"Nazi\\" seems more real than anyone else on the show), the jokes will make you smile occasionally, and the intensity of being a first year doctor is obviously in place, but where Grey's Anatomy fails is the originality.  This is not original programming.  Using the season finale cliffhanger as an example, we, as a society of television watchers, have seen this all before.  The \\"shock\\" of the final episode did nothing for me.  I was not flabbergasted or excited about the upcoming season, I just felt cheated.  Why can't programs like this be more original?  You have recycled elements (newbies at a prestigious hospital) coupled with clich&eacute; moments (the head newbie has a relationship with the head doctor).  Even if you haven't seen this series yet, you already know what is going to happen.<br /><br />I think what utterly disappointed me about this program was the lack of \\"realism\\".  Sure, perhaps the lingo within the hospital walls were correct, and perhaps even the way that the interns were treated was accurate, but I do not feel that the characters (George, Izzy, Cristina, Alex, and Meredith) seemed plausible in any way.  I hate television programs claiming to be realistic dramedies that take the Friends route to acutely describe the social lives of the characters.  What I mean by this is that bills, transportation, outside circumstances that would typically be labeled as \\"real life\\", seem to go by the wayside and simply handed to them.  Take for example the party that Izzy threw at Meredith's house, how unbelievable was that?  At least 50 people and no cops were called or was there any concern of how much money these medical interns had to pay for all the booze.  Again, this was just one of many instances of this occurrence, but I hate when television programs take these shortcuts.  I want realism, I want real characters, and is it too much to ask that I want \\"real\\" issues.  Grey's Anatomy did not provide with enough laughs or enough original drama for me to enjoy it further than just your typical television series.<br /><br />Overall, I thought Grey's Anatomy played it safe.  The characters will not instantly attract you, but by the end of the first season there is a small spark in their eyes.  I will denounce the originality of this show because ... well ... there wasn't any.  The actors surrounding the characters were amateur at best, not quite grasping a character as a whole, but instead playing whatever had to be done for the immediate episode.  I know, from the votes listed here, that I will be in the minority, but I didn't think Grey's Anatomy needed to be as publicized as it was.  Was it good?  I would classify this series (at least the first season) as just \\"general\\" viewing.  If you were waiting for something to do for about an hour, I would put this program on, but to be a fan ... I think that would be difficult.  I look forward to the next season to see if the creators keep with their theme of unoriginality, or if they decide to actually push the envelope for a bit.  For this viewer, I hope they can muster enough strength to do the latter ...<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****your typical television series. <br /> <br />Overall, I thought Grey's Anatomy played it safe.

B0002KVULG|5.0|After directing the legendary \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977), Director John Badham took another job. Well, when his current superiors saw \\"Saturday Night Fever,\\" they were so horrified by the content of it, that they fired John Badham. Well, this left the great John Badham free to direct this phenomenal masterpiece. While John Badham and Frank Langella respected the Lugosi version, they were careful to not imitate it. The scenery is not only gothic, eerie, and dramatic, but it is plausible. The superb music composed by John Williams is not only dramatic, but it flatters the movie well without stomping over it. In many ways, this is the best \\"Dracula.\\" Rather than showing a grotesque or disfigured Dracula, Frank Langella makes Dracula very charming, sophisticated, and likable. Some people complained that Frank Langella didn't look scary enough. But in my opinion, the fact that Dracula looked quite normal made him all the more scary. (The more believable something is, the more scary it is.) Laurence Olivier is phenomenal as the eccentric but virtuous Abraham Van Helsing determined to put an end to Dracula's reign of terror. (Laurence Olivier earns extra kudos for delivering this performance while he was very ill.) Donald Pleasence is memorable as Dr. Seward. He has a way of gently inserting some badly needed comic relief into this horror filled story. (He is always eating.) Trevor Eve does a great job of portraying the everyday person thrust into a series of unusual events, who is a skeptic at first, but can be convinced with the right evidence. Kate Nelligan is wonderful as the daughter of Dr. Seward who despite her intelligence, falls under the charm of Dracula. (Director John Badham created a scene of erotic beauty when he created the vampire wedding between Lucy and Dracula. Rather than than the cliche of removed clothing, the scene is done with shadows and artistic elements.) Like a true masterpiece, the story starts at a slow and normal pace,  but it gradually picks up and becomes more fast and scary. (Good horror often starts slow and plausible and then gradually picks up the pace and becomes quicker and more frightening.) Director John Badham is also careful not to get carried away with blood and effects. (When blood and effects are overdone, the story becomes less believable, less scary, and more laughable.) Also, Director John Badham seems to know that dramatic wording is more scary than cliches and curses: \\"It is not matter of life and death, it is that we shall become such as she. That we and your Lucy shall become foul things of the night. There is work. Wild work to be done.\\" I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, but one of the strongest elements of horror is how we gradually see Dracula (this seemingly charming and  sophisticated gentleman) reveal himself as a terrifying killer. Between the excellent directing, the great acting, the beautiful scenery, and the memorable music, this is arguably the greatest \\"Dracula\\" ever made. The dvd has 2 nice extras. One is (\\"Revamp of Dracula\\") which is a nice set of interviews with Director John Badham, Frank Langella, and others. The other is the feature length commentary. Some standouts are how Donald Pleasence knew how to draw attention to himself, how Frank Langella was unaware of the eerie effect he created with his vibrating eyes, how Director John Badham had to fight to keep the scene where Vampire Mina reflected in the water, how Laurence Olivier insisted he had a right to drop his jaw when he saw Dracula turn into a wolf, and how Kate Nelligan was really reluctant to smack Laurence Olivier with the buggy whip. If you like this horror filled masterpiece, be sure to look at John Badham's \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977) and \\"Short Circuit\\" (1986).cks up and becomes more fast and scary.

B000063Y8F|5.0|This is the most wonderful garlic press in the world because of the ease of cleanup.    My old toothpick-cleaning routine with the other garlic press was getting old, old, old.    This one is phenominal!!  The bottom of the basket swings right out and you can just brush/rinse off what you need to!!  No debris in the joints, etc., because everything is open.    I wish I had mine YEARS ago!!    UPDATE (June 19, 2006):  There is an added benefit to this garlic press!!  If you have odors on your hands from garlic, onions, fish, etc. - just rub your hands on the stainless steel handles under running water and poof! - the odors are gone!  Works just like those little stainless steel \\"soap\\" bars!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Unbelievable! Even after the wonderful story of Brokeback Mountain came on the market for half a year now, there are still sexist people! This just proves what reviewers have been saying, that there are people who are not smart enough to get this movie. Comments like how men should behave is percisely why women in society get treated like sex symbols, and do not get the respect we deserve. If you are still making this comment, that means you have not truly learned from Brokeback Mountain. Watch it a hundred more times before saying anything again!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Ill start off by saying that I lay no claim in that this is the best Tool album to date. Though compairing this to much else as of the last, say, five years (wink wink), it is a masterpiece. So much creativity goes into these albums it is mind boggling, reguardless the time I spend on each, they all posses there own distinct characteristics, and end up doing it near, if not flawlessly. Its easy to say something like this, but you truely do find something new with each listen. I can't get over how well done and different from damn near everything else of which these<br />guys are prone to produce, and in the end make it some of the best, most beautiful music ever made. Period. It starts off rough and ends beautifuly. The songs tend to be longer, but as you listen, you truely do lose track of time, in the most of tacky sence. Is it groundbreaking? You bet. Is it revolutionary? Probobly not, by Tool standards at least. Mainstreemly, of corse it is, its Tool. I listened to Anima and Lateralus so much, it would be hard to compair anything to them. So ill let you decide, as you should if it is indeed top tier. Honestly, I cannot decide what the best Tool album is. Lateralus put so much more on the table, and Anima broke so many boundaries creatively. Im not going to say much else about the other albums, becuase this is a review for the new and highly anticipated 10,000 days. Im going to break down the songs individually, and rate each as such. I'll give no OMGBBQ 99999/10, becuase to me that seems foolish; ill simply say if its my favorite, or least favorite.<br /><br />Lets get started, then.<br /><br />Vicarious- Honestly, when this song was released, and dont hate me for this, I didn't think much of it. Though when I bought the cd it instantly became a favorite. Easily 10/10.<br /><br />Jambi- Now, different from Viv. this song I instantly fell in love with. Everything is near perfection; the tempo, the guitars, Maynards voice is blended seamlessly. 10/10.<br /><br />Wings For Marie (Pt 1)- I did not get to hear this song the minute I bought the cd, for I skipped ahead to the ones that I had heard parts of, then came back around and listened to them all. An amazing feat in musicmanship. 9.5/10.<br /><br />10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)- Beautiful. Time consumingly addictive. Just a fiew words to describe one of the best songs on the record. Am I going to judge this song by how long it is? Hell no. Thats one thing I love about it. If it were any shorter, well, I probobly wouldnt know about it so id love it anyway. But it truely is amazing. 10/10.<br /><br />The Pot- One of my first favorite songs on the album. Love the start. Though I have come to favor some of the others songs, I will judge this one from my first impression. 9.5/10.<br /><br />Lipan Conjuring- Quite honestly, this song just doesnt do it for me. If it can even be called that, a \\"song.\\" Though it is a filler, or whatever you want to call it, and I appreciate it for that, I cannot help but start thinking the guy is saying \\"Ahh yeahhh\\" as Little Jon would; a tittle of which I dont think anyone on this plannet would appreciate to be dubbed as. I do like the scream at the end, though. ;} 5/10.<br /><br />Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)- Was origonally put off by this track but it truely is great. I love the start. I love the filling, and I love the end. No singing here, horever. This is a conjunction track to better explane the next one, as I understand it. Guitars are amazing, the voices creep in unknowingly. Good stuff. Great music. 8.5/10.<br /><br />Rosetta Stoned- As with a couple songs of which I have noted, this song creeped up on me. Was not to amazed at first, but it has become...good. Kind of put off by the whole \\"S**t the bed again\\" thing, however. That line just seems...out of place. Great song, nonetheless. 9/10.<br /><br />Intension- Weird song. Love it or hate it. Perosnally, I find it to be one of the lesser tracks on this disk. But then again, we are talking aboutTool here. 8.5/10.<br /><br />Right In Two- Ahh. Finally time for my personal favorite. Right In Two could quite possibly be my favorite Tool song ever. I love the lyrics. It is easier to just say I love everything about this song. Best on the album, in my oppinion. Clean and easy 10/10.<br /><br />Viginti Tres- Another weird song. Not a bad ending. Not the best ending. The voice is creepy, but thats one reason why we listen to Tool in the first place. 7/10<br /><br />Keep in mind that 50% is supposed to be the average. Though I know we often forget this, it truely is the median. A 9.5 is a 95% obviously. Try and keep this in mind.<br /><br />Now, are these songs perfect? Not particulary. Are they the vision of what the artists wanted? They sure as hell sound like it to me; you cant make something like this up over a weekend. I dont have Tool stickers on the back window of my car. I dont wear the Tool shirts, or beanies. Though I am a long time Tool fan, and have listened to every record countless times. Weather that makes me a Tool expert or not is up to you. Im just here to provide my oppinion and insight. Which is this: Buy this album. I cant guarontee you will absolutely love it, but truethfully there is something to be found here for everybody.ht In Two could quite possibly be my favorite Tool song ever. I love the lyrics.

1400079179|4.0|If Dan Brown is really serious about \\"ideas\\" and \\"controversies\\" here he is not only a pluperfect moron but one of the funniest pluperfect morons I have ever read! Somehow I don't think the two go together, so I am guessing that he a) is NOT serious about it and b) has done one of the most stupendous hype jobs in the history of publishing.<br /><br />As a very serious and somewhat conservative Christian, I read the book just to see what the noise is all about. What I found was an implausible plotline, a less-than-well-refined style, and what seemed to me like someone having a huge laugh at the expense of the credulous public. Great it is certainly not. Fun it is, and funny, too.<br /><br />The book reads like a parody of Umberto Eco's \\"Foucault's Pendulum,\\" which is itself a dark parody of that community obsessed with the occult and bristling with lunatic conspiracy theories. Brown is more readable than Eco, which is not saying much.<br /><br />As to the subject matter, unless he has made claims elsewhere, I do not find Brown -- whether in the text, a foward, or subsequent notes -- making any claims as to the historical validity of the underlying thesis. If he has claimed it elsewhere, it must be pure baseless hype that has paid off in spades.  The ideas are too bizarre and the \\"historical facts\\" too far off base from demonstrable reality to be taken seriously.<br /><br />For example, the whole Council of Nicea thing.  The Council of Nicea did not settle on the Christian Canon. In fact, there was no official Catholic (let alone Protestant) position on the Canon until a hundred years or more after the Protestant Reformation. The Christian Canon was an evolutionary thing, that was essentially decided -- insofar as it was \\"decided\\" at all -- by consensus among the Christian churches of the first three or four centuries after Jesus. The basis of their acceptance was whether each writing appeared to be authentically produced by or in close association with someone who actually knew Jesus.  The writing also had to be consistent with those other writings already accepted on that basis. The Gnostic \\"gospels\\" met none of these criteria and were produced at significantly later dates. The canon has often been debated and some books challenged even since then. (See Eusebius's history of the church. Eusebius was Bishop of Caesarea and closely associated with Constantine.) If the Council did not settle the Canon, how can it have supressed anything?<br /><br />There are too many such discrepancies to review them all, but Brown seems to be a reasonably intelligent author, so surely he must know (and not care) how thin this \\"evidence\\" really is.<br /><br />Other things are just too ludicrous to take seriously, and I am convinced that Brown knows it and is enjoying the joke.  Even the non-Christian or anti-Christian would have to admit that Jesus was at the very least a Jewish prophet, whose teachings affirmed absolutely the singularity of God, God's sole claim to the allegiance of humankind, and the moral and spiritual truths of the Hebrew law and prophets. Now picture this man marrying a woman who would run off to France and essentially institute an Isis cult!!!!!!! ROFL<br /><br />How can Brown be anything but tongue-in-cheek when halfway down the list of grand masters of the Priory of Sion, there appears the name of a character from \\"The Golden Girls?\\"e who actually knew Jesus.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I think too many people are looking at this movie just to find flaws in it to criticize about. As much as critics say that they are not homosexual, this is just a bad movie, the truth is that this movie demonstrate true mastery of humanity. In fact, it is so good that critics let some church's homophobic propaganda get the best of them. This movie has it all: heart-felt storyline, beautiful cinematography, story dynamic, and turn of events. The only thing it lacks is punk band making horrible noises in the background, and immature actors doing stunts on screen which, by the way, is actually a good thing. You can love this movie, or hate it, but in the end, you have to admit that this is the best movie made in the last decade, particularly considering that this movie did not throw in hundreds of millions of dollars.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Just like a reviewer before me said, the feeling you get from this movie stays with you forever. Unlike this reviewer, however, I see this feeling in a completely different light. <br /> <br />The feelings you get from this movie comes from a time when same-sex love need to be kept closed doors because the society is highly homophobic. The love that developed from this time spread like wildfire, and viewers are left with the remorse for Jack's unfortunate death. This feeling SHOULD stay with you forever, and Ang Lee did a very good job creating this feeling. <br /> <br />So overall, this film does bring tears into your eyes, but these are tears of true humanity, and people should cherish this tear, not put it off.
B000003TAW|5.0|There are few albums I've come across in my life time that I've not given the skip treatment to, from start to finish this album is entrancing. This album landmarks a different type of Weezer, a type of Weezer that practiced their songs in the garage at a friend's house rather then in studios. It seems as though there is a good varitey with in the album itself,from \\"Say it Ain't So,\\" a track about an alacholic father to \\"Only in Dreams,\\" a day dreamer for someone who is infatuated with another person, to \\"Holiday,\\" the perfect song for anyone looking to get away on a vacation. If ever someone were to ask where they should start when it comes to Weezer, I hope the answer they get will be, \\"Start at the beginning, with the Blue Album.\\"
B000E41MS6|5.0|I'm a long time Dr. Who fan.  Yep, cranky William Hartnell, funny Patrick Troughton, dapper Jon Pertwee, the odd Tom Baker, bland Peter Davison(sorry), obnoxious Colin Baker, and the UNIQUE Sylvester McCoy.  One way or another it has lived up to all the imaginings sci-fi can summon up. <br />We only had one movie with Paul McGann, so I really can't comment on him. <br />Now Christopher Eccleston.  In an interview, both Christopher Eccleston and Russell T. Davis realized that Mr. Eccleston won't win over the \\"hard core\\" fans of the show, but they are wrong.  The BBC encourages comments about different shows it's aired.  Dr. Who is rated one of highest sci-fi show for all ages.  Season 1-2005, is right up there.  My first Doctor was Jon Pertwee, but I've enjoyed them all.  Then I found Sylvester McCoy.  He was wonderful.  Davis and Eccleston have brought my two favorite Doctors together.  What else can I say. <br /> <br />In this first season, they have used all the quirks of Dr. Who to bring the new viewers up to date.  Who is the Doctor?  Where is he from?  What is the TARDIS?  Though they don't come out and say Gallifrey, it saddens me that the planet has been destroyed.  What is that 'tube' he carries?  Just about everything that has existed in the Dr. Who myth has been brought forward, though I'd love to see him in Patrick Troughton's Yeti coat tied with a rope.  That would be hysterical. The saddest bit of the first season will be Rose's introduction to regeneration.  It was a brilliant idea to replace the ailling William Hartnell.  <br />I wish Mr. Eccleston had decided to stay, at least for 2 more seasons.  Peter Davison had a rule that he wouldn't stay in a role more than 3 years, so he wouldn't be completely identified with the character.  It makes sense.  I wish Mr. Eccleston  had the same rule.  It would have been nice to see him for another 2 more years.  He is a wonderful actor and after 15 years, he has made the Doctor tangible again. <br /> <br />I hadn't known of Mr. Eccleston prior to his portrayal of the Doctor, but now I do and I will keep watch for his other projects.  After bringing the Doctor back to us with his portrayal of the Doctor, I wish Mr. Eccleston all the best in what he has planned for his career.
B00005QIPH|4.0|While it may be said that perhaps the music of the Strokes does not seem as heavily focused on so much as the image they portray to the media and in their publicity, they are a band that delivers. From having heard both \\"Room on Fire,\\" and \\"First Impressions of Earth,\\" I would have to argue that by and large this is my favorite album of theirs. From the catchy lyrics to the up beat drums and guitars on all of the tracks, this album has a bit of edge despite Julian's writing on his relationships which typically you might think would have a slower take on things, doesn't with this. \\"The Modern Age,\\" \\"Soma,\\" \\"Barely Legal,\\" \\"Someday,\\" and \\"last Nite,\\" are some of the more memorable tracks on the album, so make sure you get to them. Weather your into the Stokes or not, or you came about them by recommendation, this is an excellent album to begin with, so give it a chance, and you'll find your foot tapping to the beat.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|It's annoying listening to all these guys calling for \\"mom.\\"  Mom, mom, mom.. Couldn't they come up with something more mature, and perhaps cooler name for something that all these guys are fighting for?  (They are just referring some cell as mom..) Although I have great respect for final fantasy makers, including song-writers and charater designers, the major flaw of final fantasy movies is their lack of creativity - like many other Japanese movies.  Perhaps I watched too many good movies lately.  This movie where all these charaters repeating mom is somewhat disappointing at best.  I was hoping to see much improvements from \\"The Spirit Within,\\" a disasterous movie. It was a going comment that Square Soft - now Square Enix - could only make great games, but not great movies.  Well, they still can't. <br /> <br />But the action is undoubtedly great.  Not only that, you get to see Tifa in action!  Her voice is not what I had expected, nor did I see her action often enough (she had a brief 2 min combat with yet another helpless, abandoned guy searching for mom), but hey, not bad for $15+ movie!
B00005JO20|3.0|The 1933 KING KONG was very much \\"state of the art\\" and then some for its era, a great financial success, and even as special effects have advanced it has remained a great favorite.  A 1976 version proved popular at the box office, but seemed to leave a sour taste in the audience's mouth, falling out of favor as soon as it ended its theatrical run; nonetheless, many studios and directors have been attracted to the idea of a third remake over the years.  After demonstrating his mastery of CGI blockbusters with THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, director Peter Jackson got the green light.<br /><br />Although there have been more than a few tweaks, the basic story remains the same.  Producer-Director Carl Denham (Jack Black) is desperate for an actress to appear in a semi-documentary film, and he lures down-on-her-luck Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) into joining him on an expedition to an uncharted island.  Along the way, Ann falls in love with Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody)--but when the party arrives at Skull Island she finds herself beloved by the tallest, darkest leading man in film history.<br /><br />On the surface, the film has a lot going for it.  Rather than update the film, Jackson elected to set it in the early 1930s, and the images of period New York are impressive; so too are the CGI effects from start to finish.  But it rapidly turns into too much of a good thing.  Jackson seems to feel that if one was good in the original film, then three or more will better--and so once we arrive on Skull Island we have herds of dinosaurs, not to mention a host of really nasty insects and some equally foul bats-like creatures.  A great many people have said it looks more like a video game than a movie, and the criticism is dead on target.<br /><br />If the CGI is wildly overdone, the film also suffers from a  script that saddles Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody with a certain goody-goody-gumdrops quality--and to add insult to injury calls for Jack Black, in what must be the most totally unappealing performance of the past decade, to stand around with narrowed eyes and a shifty expression.  He looks more like a dope dealer on the lam than a documentary film maker, and his every scene is both tired and tiresome beyond all possible description.<br /><br />But the ultimate killer, in my opinion any way, is the film's total lack of innocence.  It's a 1933 story remade in 2005 but dressed up in 1933 clothes--and it doesn't have the conviction of its costuming.  I didn't believe any of it, not for a single CGI-laden minute.  So far as mindless eye candy goes, the 2005 KING KONG is (Jack Black excepted) reasonably entertaining, but it really doesn't have any content to set it apart from the rest of the CGI pack, and I can't imagine that it will be remembered any more fondly than the largely forgotten 1976 version.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewertotally unappealing performance of the past decade, to stand around with narrowed eyes and a shifty expression.

B00005JOFQ|2.0|I've been wanting to see this movie since it first came out, but couldn't find anyone willing to go with me to the theater to see it.  After the movie was out on DVD I bought a used copy at reduced price.  My husband and two sons (ages 13 and 21) were horrified that I had purchased the movie.  I made sure to watch it when they weren't home, so they couldn't ruin it for me.   <br /> <br />I'm not homophobic in the least.  I watched the movie completely with an open mind.   <br /> <br />The story was slow, the actors muffled their words, and the ending was extremely depressing.  Immediately after watching it, I rated it \\"Good, but VERY sad.\\"  I even found it a little sexy in a strange sort of way. <br /> <br />The next day, however, after giving it more thought... I was really grossed out!  The two cowboys were just too masculine for a romance to be taking place between them.  I realized what I found sexy was that I liked the men in the movie.   <br /> <br />I watched the movie on a Saturday night.  Come Sunday morning, while I was sitting in church, I started feeling a little guilty about having viewed some of the sexual scenes the night before.  GADS!!  I will never watch it again, nor will I recommend it to others.   <br />
B000E6UK5K|5.0|to all the wonderful reviews of this album. But who am I kidding. HA!   I had the ultimate pleasure of seeing him & his peeps perform in concert this last April in Oakland, and he played this album in full. Just the recreation in my mind of this show is well, dreamy.  (I'm almost 47, cut me some slack!!) When he plays his sax solo, I can see him in my mind's eye, drenched and backlit in red smokey fog, mesmerizing the audience with this red hot beautiful sound. It's SMOKIN!!!! I never knew he played the saxophone. And of course his guitar just blew you away.  The acoustics were so fabulous, and I can't play it loud enough at my place!!!  He is truly a fabulously talented man.   I hate to say it, but you die-hard Floyd dudes, it ain't gonna happen. It would be great, but I think they are at entirely different places in their lives, not that I wouldn't pay a ridiculous amount of $$ to see it happen.   It's over!!!  But this man, and his fellow musicians, and with the collaboration of writing some songs with his wife, sounds to me like a man who has found his true love, is happy with his life and family, and just wants to share it with everyone.  Yeah, some of the songs are mushy and again, dreamy, but I would love to have someone sing them to me. His song called \\"The Blue\\" is so beautiful; it makes me think of the Caribbean Sea, so enveloping, so lush, so perfect. Laying on a blankie, mapping out stars with your honeybunch sounds pretty freakin awesome in my book. Good for you, David and Polly.  You can't begrudge the guy some happiness, when it eludes so many. I love this record and the mood it evokes;  reflective, peaceful, fulfilled and from the heart and soul.  love it love it love it.  Also, the David Gilmour in Concert-2002 is my absolute all time best ever most groovy fave.  I've listened to it and watched no less than oh about 5,000 times, and NEVER tire of seeing or hearing him and his fellow musicians.  Some of the best parts are/is the smile he gives his backup singers after singing \\"Je Crois Entendre Encore\\" just a simple gesture of happiness, and his back-up guitar player's face when he starts \\"Wish you Were Here\\"  He's so totally-odally into it!!!!  Look at his face; it's great!  I say, for a visual and audio feast-o-rama, have \\"On an Island\\" and the 2002 concert DVD in your Fave 'o Dave collection.  It never fails to put a smile on my face, or just get all DREAMY!!!
B000000Y2R|5.0|The amazing music at this concert is rightly famous in spite of the uneven levels and other recording problems that often trouble great jazz records.<br />Being a fan of classical jazz who appreciates even the primitively recorded music from the 1920s (\\"squeek\\", \\"screetch\\"), I can't be very critical of problems that Mr. Greenbaum points to in his elaborate and extremely useful review on this site.<br /><br />For me, this recording compares to some earlier artists' classical work like a theater performance given months ofter the opening night to the performance at the very opening night. When the actors know each other well and no longer worry about the outcome of the production and the reaction of the critics, they can relax and trully create.<br />Compared to Gillespie's and Parker's recordings from the 40's, this music is more relaxed but still trully creative and imaginative; it seems that experience in be-bop idiom (like in most any other idiom) is beneficial for all the involved parties.<br />I have mentioned only two players from this great quintet full of fire and rhythm but, let's face it, they are the reason to buy this cd. The others, great musicians themselves, are (\\"only\\") first class supporting crew at this historical concert.<br />I'm not really an expert in jazz, but I still want to contribute my five stars at this point...
B0006OBPTA|5.0|In the 80s we saw some huge Blockbusters and modern day Classics.  IMO, The Karate Kid (1-3) is a modern day Classic.  Part 4 just isn't what the first three were, but I don't know that it is right to do a comparison.   <br /> <br />This is something that every DVD own should have in their collection.  The \\"Back to the Future\\" trilogy is the only thing that can compare.   <br /> <br />Pure Greatness.
B00004W50Z|5.0|Expectations were high when the Band released their third album in 1970. After two masterpieces, would they be able to do it again?<br /><br />Guitarist and main song-writer Robbie Robertson had expressed a wish to do a more basic rock'n roll album - a more light-hearted good time record.<br /><br />At the same time things were beginning to get more complicated for some members of the Band. Their commercial success meant money, and money meant temptations and easy access to drugs. At the time of the recordings of \\"Stage Fright\\" all three singers were taking heroin, and this obviously influenced the record and to some extent changed the sound of their vocals.<br /><br />Though Robertson managed to write some lyrics that fit his original idea of a basic light-hearted rock album; other songs deal with darker sides of life.<br /><br />Opening song, \\"Strawberry Wine\\", sung and co-written by Levon Helm is a blues fitting nicely into the original concept.<br /><br />This is the last album where singer Richard Manuel contributes original material, and Robertson had to help him finish his two songs. \\"Sleeping\\" is a beatiful pianoballad with a rocking chorus; obviously sung by Manuel.<br /><br />\\"Time to Kill\\" has a great catchy guitar intro and rocks on nicely with Danko and Manuel sharing the lead vocals.<br /><br />The second Manuel song is \\"Just Another Whistle Stop\\", which features another fine intro, and it is also one of the few Band studi-recording with an extended guitar-solo from Robertson.<br /><br />All four opening tracks bear the high quality mark of the Band, but the first really outstanding track is Robertson's beautiful lullaby/ballad \\"All La Glory\\". This is such a great song with Helm doing one of his best ever recorded vocals.<br /><br />The dark theme is coming forward on the next rocker \\"The Shape I'm In\\" - sung by Manuel.<br /><br />The slightly jazzy \\"W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\\" is quite amusing featuring different brass instruments, but lyrically the song show a serious side of Robertson's songwriting.<br /><br />The original album was ended with 3 more outstanding Band songs; all personal favourites of mine.<br /><br />\\"Daniel and the Sacred Harp\\" is a country/folky song telling a the story of Daniel in a similar way the Dylan told the story of \\"Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\\". It's always a thrill when the three singers share the verses and all join in on the chorus.<br /><br />The title track sung by Rick Danko, was an immediate live-favourite and one Danko finest performances; which says a lot.<br /><br />\\"The Rumor\\" is another outstanding ballad, again with all singers taking lead verses. A worthy final the a great album.<br /><br />The album is often regarded as a step downhill for the Band; I don't see it that way - it's a little different, yes, but just a strong as its predecessors.<br /><br />This new version of the album features some interesting alternate versions, but none ot them matches the original recordings.ended with 3 more outstanding Band songs; all personal favourites of mine.    \\"Daniel and the Sacred Harp\\" is a country/folky song telling a the story of Daniel in a similar way the Dylan told the story of \\"Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\\".

1400079179|4.0|There is a reason this has been one of the top-selling books for several years now.  It is a well-written thriller with twists and turns that make it hard to put down.  As a movie and a novel it has created a lot of controversy because of the fictional part of the book that claims that Jesus had a wife, children, and also that the Bible is a sham.  Unfortunately, many will not realize that this movie is fiction.  I actually have heard of a Christian who took the fiction written in this book as true fact.  He obviously didn't know much about his faith.  Although many may be misled, it is still an excellent story.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the book is the element of surprise that lurks behind almost every chapter.  The plot is thick with suspense, and characters are constantly turning out to be totally different people than first imagined.  Not only is it a great story with great suspense, but all the historic information (the nonfiction and the fiction) and geographical locations make the story an absolute delight to read.
B000002H97|5.0|This is still a huge metallica album, not thrash, but with a great song writting and composition, its worth getting this album, songs like My Friend of Misery, The God That Failed, the Unforgiven and even Nothing Else Matters are true gems.
0451526015|5.0|\\"How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June...If it were only the other way! If it where I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that-for that-I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my own soul for that!\\"<br /><br />Meet Dorian Gray. He has the perfect look. He shines with such youth and beauty that he amazes everyone he comes in contact with. According to Lord Henry Wotton, however, he does not fully realize what he has. When their mutual friend, Basil Hallward, a painter, decides to paint a portrait of Dorian, he ends up capturing that youth and beauty almost perfectly in his painting. Dorian is mezmerized by it. After listening to Lord Henry's philosophy about how youth and good looks are more important than being good-hearted, Dorian claims he would do anything to let the picture grow old and decay, while he will stay young and beautiful for the rest of his life.<br /><br />It is only a downward spiral for Dorian after that. He continues to believe in the ways of Lord Henry. His face remains perfect and unlined as he commits sin after sin. The only way anyone would have known Dorian's true colors would be to take a look at his portrait; for his face on the portrait would take on the age lines and the sinister look that Dorian truly should bare in the flesh. The sight of his picture horrifies Dorian so deeply that he locks it up, and would not let anyone look at it. Dorian himself is too afraid to look at it. However, this does not stop Dorian from listening to Lord Henry and believing the same way he does.<br /><br />Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great novel. The wit, humor, horror, and philosophy all comes together to make this story exactly what the description of the book says: timeless. The philosophical views of Lord Henry alone will make you question your own outlook on life. The plot is somewhat predictable, and so is the ending, but this doesn't keep Oscar Wilde's only full-length novel from being a great read. Also included in this book are his short stories, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, The Happy Prince, and The Birthday of the Infanta. Go ahead and pick this book up and start reading.e you question your own outlook on life.

B000CNE092|4.0|This is a really good movie by 20th Century Fox. I think it could have been better but it certainly has gotten alot of younger people interested in Russian history. This movie is based on the 1956 film which was adapted from a popular play of the time by Marcelle Maurette. The play was based on the real life of Anna Anderson, a woman who may or may not have been the Grand Duchess Anastasia as she claimed until her death in 1984. The film starts with a young Anastasia who, during the Russian Revolution brought on by the evil Rasputin character, escapes with her grandmother from the seige of the palace through a hole in the wall. Anastasia hits her head during a hard fall however and is seperated from her grandmother, the Dowager Empress Marie. <br /> <br />Ten years later, in 1926, rumors float around St. Petersburg that the youngest daughter of the former Tsar is still alive. We are then taken to an orphanage with a young girl named Anya who has no memory of her past except for a necklace with the words, 'Together in Paris'. The young girl then sets off on a journey to discover who she really is. <br /> <br />The best part of the movie is without a doubt when Anya enters the Palace and sees the images of the dead Imperial Family dancing around to 'Once Upom A December'. I certainly reccomend this movie.
B00005JOVH|5.0|No need to recap or synopsize what other have said. Here's my take.<br /><br />Best one of the three. Least `camp' factor. Deadly serious. Consistently dark, and with nobody taking easy ways out. Those who needed to die died. It doesn't end fuzzy-wuzzy, but hopeful.<br /><br />Better than Spiderman; more complex, less navel-gazing, yet possibly more profound. Underneath the vexing question: what constitutes `illness' or `disease'? What does it mean to be different, and especially if there's a whole lot of you? This isn't Spiderman agonizing over his authenticity of being or something like that, but a whole group of people whose identity as individuals and a community are under threat. Do they have the right to defend themselves. How far are they allowed to go? How far is the rest of the world allowed to go? This isn't about right and wrong but questions that have no definite answer.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com. Author: Keaen, Seladiënna, Continuity Slip.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Stanley Kubrick has a track record that stands alone amongst film makers....always doing things his own way and in his own style.His hand has guided some of the best films in history (his last film Eyes Wide Shut was not that great,unfortunately) and what makes FMJ just a little more interesting is that in it,the character Joker is the audience and his reactions to what he sees are also ones we could have had in the same situation.And as the follies of war are laid out in front of us,all we can do is watch.The story is about Vietnam for a recent recruit,from his first steps on to Parris Island to the conflict and brutality of war in SE Asia.With scences that could (and indeed did) silence a theater full of people,Kubrick made it clear that the long waits between films was not down time but gestation time for the next project.  The film is beautifully shot and the attention to detail is almost perfect and as always,Kubrick never left England but did manage to make you think that you ARE in Vietnam.  And last but not least is R Lee Ermey as the frightening Marine drill sargent Sgt.Hartman.....certainly one of the most vivid and intense portrayals in film history.His time spent working with Kubrick brought a vicious and ultra-realistic edge to this amazing film.To say that this film is one of the most thought provoking and intense films ever made and directed by one of the most courageous and taleted men ever in this medium is really just not strong enough.Full Metal Jacket is a  must have.Period.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|This was one of those films I simply had fun watching, from beginning to end. <br /> <br />Ledger was really enjoyable to see in this role -- not a lot of depth to the character, but very charasmatic and embodied his role. <br /> <br />Some of the scenes are a little silly, but in good fun. Oliver Platt was HYSTERICAL in his role, a really good, funny portrayal of someone most of us would not want to portray, he really deserved more attention for this role!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie is breathtaking, moving and exquisite. All the performances are perfection. Bravo a million times over.  <br /> <br />Yes the A and E production is the gold standard--a truly remarkable achievement in every way--but this film grabbed me even more. It definitely got shafted at the Oscars and should have received a Best Picture nomination. The score is exquisite and will make you cry every time you hear it. Buy this movie. You will watch it over and over again!!
B00008A7QK|5.0|In my opinion, T.Rex is one of the most underated bands of all time. I also belive this is one of the greatest rock n' roll albums of all time. Next to Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, this is the most difinitive album of the Glam Rock era. Every song is great, and the extras make the album even better. Marc Bolan was a true musical genious, and one of the great forgotten artists. I would recomend this to any fan of old school rock.  <br /> <br />HOGEY OUT!
B0000073BG|4.0|My favourite tracks are 1,3, and 4.  Annie's five octave voice will mesmerise you.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is far from a band in the traditional sense of the word. More than anything they are a union of true composer/musicians. In a time when the word \\"artist\\" is used far too loosely, these juggernauts transcend the concept and define it.  <br /> <br />\\"10,000 Days\\" does not contain songs. It is an aggregate of compositions whose content shatters the barriers of hard rock/heavy metal music. The song \\"10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)\\" is a masterpiece itself. The aural landscape and musical skill displayed here is simply astounding.  <br /> <br />Yes I am a Tool fan and have been since the early days of \\"Opiate.\\" But my review is not derived from this prejudice. If this album were rubbish, I would sternly say so. I am pleased to state the contrary, that this album is a feat of epic proportions, and as such, is superb.
B0000033RY|5.0|This is a great collection from a most often overlooked band.<br /><br />If you need a blast of good ol Rockin, Throbbin, Blusy, Guitar Power....WELL<br /><br />Try this on on for size.<br /><br />The guys just tore the roof off BB King's Club in Times Square NY tonite and I am so glad to have caught the show. I have this CD in my collection and I intend to review the power and glory of this terrific group over and over  again.
0060764899|4.0|The Chronicles of Narnia are unique from any other book I've read, considering every time I reread them I get a different opinion.<br /><br />The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is technically the one that started them all, if you read them in the correct order, against the publishers' intentions. It's not the best, but really is the most memorable. Here you are introduced to the four Pevensie children- Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Lucy, the youngest, ventures into a wardrobe at her eccentric relative's house and finds herself in a different world- Narnia, home of the evil White Witch and the mythical Lion Aslan.<br /><br />Nowadays you could dismiss this book as one-dimensional and predictable- yes, good triumphs over evil, there's a bit of forgiven betrayal, and a child's dream comes true. But Narnia is completely unique, because it was CS Lewis that came up with this other world idea, and it was from his Narnia books that all the others were spun off of.<br /><br />Narnia reads like a fairytale. Lucy is sweet, Susan is mature, Peter is a warrior, Edmund is an oddball that goes through random personalities changes. Aslan is faultless, the Witch is cruel. But all that is where the magic comes from. Somehow these characters all work and are believable and readable. You are surprised and hooked till the end.<br /><br />Despite Lewis's awkward dialogue, his obvious love for the word \\"presently\\" and dragging descriptions, these books are classics, to be read over and over. As I've said, every time you read them you understand a bit more.
B00008O31H|5.0|A friend of mine got me hooked on this Band. At 1st I was hesitant at 1st,,, I had a mixed reaction. I listened to The Black Keys 1st disc and was amazed by the blend of music they had. I was just a little upset that the songs were so short. I receieved the other 2 for my birthday and am totally hooked. All the music is addicting and seems like you need to repeat it over and over. I think I need to get a multi-disc player for my truck.
B000BTJCRM|4.0|Wow. That is the first thing that came out of my mouth when I heard the opening scream on Dimension. From that moment alone, I knew that this was the real deal. I knew this was some serious Rock and Roll. And for me, the return of old school rock is the greatest thing to ever happen. Sure, Jet and the Darkness made attempts at ushering the new era of Classic Rock in, but they couldnt do it. I am sure this will bring it all back.  <br /> <br />Lets start talking bout the music. Of course there will be comparisons to Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and even Jethro Tull (on Witchcraft). But there is deffinitly something diffrent. Wolfmother sounds (essentially) like a garage band. A very, very polished garage band. Due to this, there is a hint of White Stripes in the sound.  <br /> <br />Wolfmother has a very raw power. If you like good old classic rock, this album is for you. If not, may god have mercy on your soul. HOGEY OUT.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|AwwWWWW EEWWWW, another DOUBLE ALBUM---one side HARD, the other SOFT>? or kinda soft...leftovers from BY THE WAY??  They should have released this as a single album...with 14 tracks....the previous reviewers have it right about the songs they think are the best...I just will go listen to CALIFORNICATION and Mother's Milk....By the way, no pun intended...THEY ROCK AS A LIVE BAND so check them out!!!!!!!   PEACE OUT!
087349976X|5.0|I love this book! I'm a complete beginner to wire working. I have done a little peyote stitching with beads and some basic bead stringing and I'm very happy with the bead stringing techniques in this book, the method that uses bullion is much classier than crimping the ends. I'm inspired to get some really nice pearls and make a \\"keeper\\"! I also love the way that peyote-stitched bead pieces are combined with wire working.  <br /> <br />As for wireworking, the diagrams at the front of the book were easy to follow, and I got started by making a few of the shapes there. I like that they are presented as diagrams and not photographs since I've had a hard time trying to follow photographed instructions in other books. Diagrams seem clearer to me. And having got familiar with the basic wire worked pieces, it was easy to see how they are used in the projects. Best thing is that I don't have to go out and buy all the parts, I can make them instead. Some of the clasp ideas are beautiful. I also like that the book is divided into three skill levels.  <br /> <br />I love the quality and range of the designs and find them more inspiring than what I've seen in other books. Every time I page through it I find another new idea to try. This book will be at my jewelry desk for a long time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the subject matter, and to those who need some ideas of things to make. I'm inspired!     <br />
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Please, do not see this. Save your money. Hostel (unrated) is nothing more than 90 minutes of naked women, drugs and extreme gore.  Hostel is everything you hate about Hollywood filmmaking. Hostel is not a horror movie, but rather a torture movie.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie with more nudity or gore than Hostel. It is not a movie at all, in fact, because a movie implies that there is a plot and that you are entertained. If you consider people screaming at the top of their lungs to be a choir, Hostel is for you. If you consider the dropping of a paint can, and the resulting splatter to be art, Hostel is for you. If you consider punching another to be a viable form of expressive affection, Hostel is for you. If you want heroin legalized in America, Hostel is for you. If disemboweling people is erotic to you, buy Hostel today! I am serious. That is how disgusting this movie is. The scenes are beyond shocking, and completely sickeing. I am glad my wife didn't watch, for she would have tossed up her dinner.<br /><br />Seriously, Hostel is over the edge and sickening. I am nearly forty and have seen my share of gore and horror movies, but this nearly made me sick. There was endless vomit, limbs being cut off, eyes being clipped out, etc. That is all that Hostel was: a torture movie. People torturing others, literally. This is not a date movie, nor is it a horror movie. It is really not a movie at all. Hostel is a sick fantasy for those who like extreme sex and violence together.<br /><br />Do not watch Hostel. The scenes linger in your mind for days, and you wish you could shake them.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Okay, this album is even better than Lateralus, heavier and a lot of different paths taken.  The album starts out with Vicarious which is an eerie and depressing song about the media and how people just chew it all up.  Most of the song, he uses a very quiet, almost intimidating voice sounding a bit paranoid in its own light.  Right from the start, you can also noticed the guitar-work has become much, much, much better since Lateralus which too many seemed a bit simple.  Jambi follows Vicarious in the same manner but this time he starts singing a lot more and there are some awesome time-shifts added in too.  Wings, the all-out epic 17 minute song about his mother and her wishes mainly about her devout to Christianity and her going to heaven considering she was a good person.  The whole song is beautiful and really shows you what TOOL can accomplish.  The Pot, wow, the strangest TOOL song yet and it still holds many TOOL qualities.  His voice is fantastic on this song and he goes through maybe his most vocal range... and gets heavier and heavier all the way til the end.  Lipan Conjuring is also a cool song, very weird again, sounds very tribal, haha, so I guess TOOL fans'll be right at home.  But this track is very good.  Lost Keys, Roseta Stoned, one song may be extremely hard to decipher but it further separates itself from the rest with the spoken word in the beginning.  Awesome song.  Intension, I'll have to listen to more, I can't really say anything about it because it seems more of a spiritual song and is very unstructured.  No comment for now.  Right In Two is another heavy rock song by TOOL and mainly about religion, as Maynard subsides and watches humans killing each other but he blames Father for the whole mess.  My view on it... and it may be one of the best TOOL songs yet created, I love it.  Viginti Tres is a strange one, ambient and eerie and finishes the album with fuzz.  I like it but it sounds a bit weird.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is their best.  It is the most different yet still maintaining to be as heavy as their earlier releases.  TOOL is a prominent band nowadays and I'm glad they aren't affected by the mainstream as most bands are.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Seeing talk about how men should behave, and how women should behave, and how men shouldn't be brought up by women really disturbs me. Even after countless hours of schooling where children are taught that it is healthy to express their emotion. Even after countless marriage experts who have shared their expertise on TV. Even when the film industry is brave enough to make a masterpiece as moving as Brokeback Mountain, showing that men can express truly love to each other, there are still people backwards enough to reject that.    Seriously, why do we even bother trying to create an intelligent society when brainless people still walk on our streets?
B000EULJLU|4.0|First of all, I had never heard a single Tool song untill this album. Therefore, I can't judge the band on their last album. From my standpoint, this is a very good rock album.  Sure its not a easy first listen, but alot of good albums arent. Some songs can drag on a little bit, but it doesnt throw me out of the album experience. The only thing that halted me from giving this album five stars is the last song. I am all for artistic expression, but 5 minutes of special effects amid silence is not very original. Other then that, the real standouts are \\"Rosetta Stoned\\", \\"Jambi\\", and \\"The Pot\\". This album does NOT dissapoint.  <br /> <br />HOGEY OUT.

B000F1IQNM|5.0|Our family loved nanny McPhee. It is a good, clean family movie with a good story, and none of the usual Hollywood trappings of annoying kids, ego-centric parents, sexuality, etc. Fun for the whole family.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />--All the of characters, and I mean all, were a delight to watch. They were bigger than life, and fit extremely well in a tale about a mgicial nanny.<br />--Evangeline was a great cast. She was completely buyable as the lovable servant. For that matter, all of the characters were perfectly cast, down to the priest at the wedding.<br />--The baby! The baby had us laughing over and over again.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />--The only con we had is that there seemed to be a lack of closure at the end. My wife and I wanted a bit more interaction between the characters after the major conclusion of the story. Closure is always nice, but nanny McPhee lacked that. There was no intereraction and \\"thank you's\\" after Nanny McPhee helped the family. We were saddened by this. It is hard to watch such a good film end so abruptly. It is still a 5 star family film, despite this.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 75<br /><br />43 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />8 (out of 10).

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a movie so ahead of our time that people are yet able to keep up with it. <br /> <br />Allow me to explain myself. <br /> <br />A few centuries ago, marriage is about power and benefits. Familys wed off their daughters to the rich and powerful so that they may receive the benefits of that marriage. Social classes are also very strictly governed, but eventually, human beings found that all people are equal, and abandoned the status system. Now, because the Church is homophobic, it exercises a cult-like exercise and brainwash everyone into thinking that homosexuality should be condemned. But when the emotions are so strong, it will outgrow all social conditionings. This movie shows the cruelty we have created the world to be, but unfortunately, people have yet become so accepting. Perhaps if the movie is released a few decades later, people will not be so small minded, and will embrace this movie for the love story it holds.
B0000CEB4V|4.0|Mostly great, very well-performed and nicely recorded DVD.  I really appreciate that the editing was just done \\"straight\\", without gimmicky special effects (such as slow-motion, text overlays, long audience shots, or other non-concert footage).  Music fans like myself want to just see the concert as it was, as if they were there, and that's exactly how it's presented here.  The sound quality is mostly great too, though I think they should have given us true LPCM for the 2 track audio (for me, ANY concert DVD should be in LPCM audio, since it's about the music).  But that's a minor quibble. <br /> <br />Almost all of the concert is a large band playing George's songs, with a variety of lead singers.   Mostly this works; the musicians and singers are very good, and for the most part well-known friends of GH.   Though sometimes I found myself wishing for a smaller band on at least some of the songs; feeling as George might have said that it's \\"All Too Much\\".  A couple of positive surprises were Gary Brooker - I never heard of him, but he's great on piano and lead vocal for \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" - and Sam Brown, a great looking woman with a soulful voice for \\"Horse to Water\\".  The role of lead vocal and lead guitar rested a little too often (for my taste) with Eric Clapton, should have featured Paul McCartney a little more perhaps, but otherwise was fine.   One major disappointment though is that George's son Dhani is seen but not heard.   Dhani is on stage a lot with a large hollow-body guitar, and appears to be singing and playing. But Dhani gets no solos whatsoever, so we never really get to hear his voice or guitar distinctly.  Perhaps the concert organizers thought Dhani would be nervous or not-ready-for-prime-time, but I'd have rather heard him take the lead a time or two anyway.  After all, this was supposed to be about George, not just an assembly of slick musicians. <br /> <br />Also, I'd have liked to have heard more words about George, especially from Tom Petty and Paul McCartney.  We hear plenty from Clapton and Ravi Shankar, but not enough from McCartney, and virtually nothing from Petty - despite the fact that Petty and George were very good friends with a long history going back to the 1970's, and Petty normally has plenty to say (as does McCartney, of course).  At the very least, I'd have liked the participants to have written some words about George, to be printed in the DVD booklet as a tribute to him and their friendship.  The booklet has some nice pictures of George's life, but not much personal text. <br /> <br />Since I'm particularly a fan of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, I'll write a bit about their set.  Interestingly, they play mostly without the large \\"George band\\" on two songs, then leave after their set (Petty returns for \\"Wah Wah\\", though he has a Dhani-like role there of being seen but not really heard).  Anyway, the Heartbreakers mostly sound great, though as some have noted, Petty's voice is not well suited for \\"Taxman\\".  On \\"I Need You\\" however, Petty really shines, with a plaintive take on the lead vocal, leading to a new appreciation of one of George's earliest songs.  Lead guitarist Mike Campbell and keyboardist Benmont Tench don't get as much of a chance to shine as they usually do in concert, so that will be a minor disappointment for Heartbreakers fans.  Bassist Ron Blair and drummer Steve Ferrone are very solid and strongly heard, no disappointment there.  The Heartbreakers are joined for their third and last song by Jeff Lynne and Dhani; Lynne sounds great on George's Wilbury song \\"Handle With Care\\".  Petty does ok (passable, but not as good as George, and not as good as on the \\"Soundtage\\" DVD) with the intro vocal on that song, but how great would it have been if Dhani had been given that intro vocal part?  Would have brought the house down in my opinion, would have been the highlight of the show - no doubt about it.  What could have been, oh well. <br /> <br />Still, this is a very worthwhile DVD/concert.  As to the Indian music, I found it very tedious and couldn't get through it, but maybe that's just my Western ears.  Be sure to hear George's \\"The Inner Light\\" though, that's worth a full listen (and has Jeff Lynne on vocals).  And while I do like Monty Python normally, their performances were unfortunately tasteless and not particularly funny (if you must watch one though, definitely make it the Lumberjack Song and not Sit On My Face).
B000002AS3|1.0|In the mid ninties in the absence of really huge rock bands like Zeppelin or Floyd I looked for the band that was going to hit the charts and rid them of pop garbage. And for awhile MTV fooled me into thinking Oasis was this band. After all the music was catchy (and I still think so) with sing along choruses. But even bad songs can be catchy and stick in your head. Yes, I had this album then, despite Liam's irritating voice and accent and Noel's 10th rate guitar \\"skills\\" and song writing. And I can do without layers of multi tracked guitars that only idiots think sound good. If you think this is good production I don't know just what to say. Live forever and Supersonic are good (I'd rather hear it performed by someone else) but even then the songs here doesn't make it a classic album. Shame on those musically uninformed people that voted this best British album ever. 20,000th place is more accurate.    Edit: In only a few days this many negative ratings? I guess the Brit pop crowd (God what an awful time for music) is out in full force. Just hearing Liam's voice in my head now (naoowbady knaaaoowows) makes me want to paint the wall with puke. One of the worst singers ever along with people like Scott Stapp and numerous post grunge band singers. Stay in England where the gossip writers can massage your ego and make you think you're anywhere near The Beatles. Nobody else cares about you.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Hostel is a terrible movie. It involves a couple of young Americans and one Icelander backpacking through Europe. They spend time in Amerstdam hitting the hash bars and bagging the local girls. Locked out of the local hostel one night, they meet a man who tells them about a town in Slovakia that has a lot of beautiful willing women for their pleasure. Eagerly they head out for adventure. <br /> <br />When they arrive at the town it's not like the Western European cities, but a rundown community from the post-Soviet ruled era. When they arrive at the local hostel, they meet several women. The women show them a great time, only to be set up and eventually kidnapped. They end up in a murder for profit business. These wealthy psychos pay large sums of money to torture and murder people. <br /> <br />Like every horror movie, one of the victims escapes and goes on a revenge spree. This is were the movie falls apart.  <br /> <br />The problem I have this movie it wasn't believable. I found myself snickering in several gory scences. It wasn't scary at all and the character development was non-existent.  <br /> <br />Why on earth Tarantino would lend his name for this turkey is beyond me? <br /> <br /> <br />

B0000640VO|4.0|After seeing Audrey Tatou in the film version of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" a few weeks ago,it re-awakened my interest in the French actress. I thought a good place to start was with \\"Amelie\\". Audrey Tatou plays a young woman named Amelie who grows up as an isolated young girl. As an adult, Amelie works in a local cafe as a waitress. On the night that the Princess of Wales was killed in a car accident, Amelie stumbles upon a hidden box of toys from 40 years ago hidden behind the wall of her bathroom. Right then and there, Amelie decides to find the owner of the box and return it to him, hoping that it would bring him some happiness. What happens next that this inspires Amelie to try to do the same thing to other strangers, by various questionable methods.<br /><br />Amelie's approach to try to spread some happiness to other people may be questionable through lying and breaking and entering into people's homes but her intentions are good. In the long run, Amelie not also affects the lives of the people around her but herself as well. In my opinion \\"Amelie\\" was about the celebration of life. It was nice to watch a film that wasn't filled with angst and despair for once.
B000FGGE68|1.0|A distinction: <br /> <br />There are many, many terrible movies.  A great number of those are student films, independent films made by amateurs, low-budget genre pictures, and Rob Schneider movies.  In other words: really, they never stood a chance of being good. <br /> <br />Then, there are medium- to large-budget films, such as \\"Battlefield Earth,\\" \\"Batman and Robin,\\" or \\"Howard the Duck,\\" films about which it can only be said, \\"Shouldn't someone have been able to do better than this?\\"  These are monumentally awful movies made by people who, on a fundamental level, ought to have known better. <br /> <br />\\"Ultraviolet,\\" as far as I'm concerned, is a new low amongst that latter category.  It is so bad that if I ever have a conversation with someone who honestly claims to have enjoyed it, I cannot envision failing to want to choke said person.  I'm civilized, so I won't do it; but I'll think about it.  A lot.   <br /> <br />On every single level, this film is a pathetic failure.  Milla Jovovich is awful.  Cameron Bright is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen appear in numerous movies; he was similarly terrible in \\"Running Scared,\\" \\"X-Men: The Last Stand,\\" an episode of \\"Stargate SG1,\\" and the otherwise good \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" . . . and that was in 2006 alone!  William Fichtner is mediocre, whereas he is usually terrific.  Nick Chinlund, whom I remember fondly from an excellent \\"X-Files\\" episode (the title of which escapes me), is one of the lamest villains in history. <br /> <br />Lest you think this is sounding \\"so bad it's good,\\" no, stop, that ain't it.  It's just bad.  People ride motorcycles down the sides of buildings because they've flipped a switch inside their bodies to alter their gravity.  WHAT ABOUT THE BIKE'S GRAVITY?!?  LAME! <br /> <br />The action scenes, like the one I just ranted about, are laughable.  Not exciting, not well-conceived, not original; not even campy.  It's like watching stunt choreography done by someone who had neverseen a movie before, but had been told about \\"The Matrix\\" and thought it sounded nifty.  Ridiculous . . . and I'm not usually grumpy about fight scenes, I don't care whether they're realistic or not.  These just suck. <br /> <br />There is a subplot about how some of the characters are \\"hemophages,\\" or vampires, but they don't do anything that vampires do; they don't suck blood, they don't burn in the sun, they . . . oh, they just don't make any sense.  Occasionally, it looks like they have fangs, but they disappear during most of the scenes with no explanation. <br /> <br />The color scheme is preposterous.  The entire movie -- and I'm not making this up or exaggerating in the tiniest degree -- looks like a Revlon ad.  Stylish?!?  No, sir.  Only if you're a chump, and a 13-year-old one at that.  Every single scene screams, LOOK . . . HOW . . . COOL . . . I . . . AM!  And yet, not one single cool thing ever happens.  NOT . . . ONE. <br /> <br />What more can I say?  If you liked this, I hate you.  I also hate your mother, your various uncles, your uncles' barbers, your elementary-school best friend, and the last person who sold you a taco.  And if you haven't seen \\"Battlefield Earth,\\" check it out, cause you will dig it the most. <br /> <br />If you buy this DVD, I hate you more, to the slender extent that that is possible. <br /> <br />Need more testimonial? <br /> <br />I work at a movie theatre as a projectionist; I get paid to watch movies before they come out, and even on the clock, I felt like I was being ripped off while watching this tomfoolery.  I almost clocked out and left; this movie is seriously THAT bad.  But I didn't.  You want to know why I stayed and suffered? <br /> <br />I did it for you.   <br /> <br />That's right, I did it so you don't have to.  I wept with rage; I shouted at the projector and begged it to break; I threw up in my mouth; I resolved to never talk down \\"Big Momma's House 2\\" again.  I did all of those things and more.  But I stayed. <br /> <br />Don't let it have been in vain.  Skip this garbage!
B0000931QA|5.0|If you have never listened to QueensRyche this is probably the CD for you. <br /> The entire CD is great listening that flows with conceptual brilliance.  Every track bursts with truly great hard rock and an influential storyline that progresses the CD to the very end.  Now I haven't listened to very much <br />progressive rock myself but this is most likely one of, if not the best in the genre. <br /> The CD starts off with a man in a hospital trying to remember how he arrived there and why. Now I can write a short description of how every track on the disk is incredible, but I feel the best way to interpret them is to listen for yourself; you want be dissatisfied. <br /> QueensRyche is an amazing band.  So much different from the other bands that came out of the same era. If you ever see them reperforming Mindcrime anywhere(its only happened once), go and see it.  To actually hear this CD live is something. <br />This is arguably their best CD but there are a few others worth a mention. The warning, Rage for order and Empire.  The other CDs that were released weren't nearly as powerful as the ones that I have listed.  Which is great considering that most of the bands today would be greatfull to recieve the accolade of one great CD.  The only thing that I can list as a negative is the fact you cant just listen to one track at a time.  No, no,...NOOOO!!! You must listen to them all. <br /> <br />[MTV Rocks] <br /> Even though you have written something so blatantly stupid that should not elicit any kind of rational response from anyone, it appears that you really do deserve it and so will receive a taste from me as well. <br /> First: The review name MTV Rocks:  Actually MTV doesn't rock and hasn't for quite some time.  Just an empty shell of a great idea that is now more focused on making as much money as they possibly can off of the current(yeah it didn't used to be this way) ignorance of american youth. <br />Seriously guys grow up and gain some perspective on your own. <br /> Second: Your comparing apples and oranges, but since you opened up the door for this I'll slam it in your face. <br />You picked one the most unimaginative artists of our day as your mode of comparison.  Unlike QueensRyche Usher <br />in no way stands out from the group.  So is the way of most of today's rap.  They seem to just lack the original thought <br />and sound of the NWA artist's of old.  Honestly im sick of hearing the newer rap.  It really does sound like the same <br />junk in a different package.  Not creative at all. <br /> Third:  QueensRyche still gets played and hey their still cutting tracks.  After 23 years from their original debut that's not bad. Pretty sure Usher wont be able to say the same thing in the following years.  Im pretty sure that Usher as uncreative as he is, couldn't create a hand bag to carry his BS in. <br /> Fourth:  Dude learn how to type or spell.  Gees!  There isn't a line one in the \\"review\\" that doesnt contain some sort of typo.

B000DWMYQ8|4.0|I also read all the negative reviews before seeing the movie for myself. We rented it over the weekend and rather enjoyed it. It accomplished pretty much everything it set out to accomplish, and while it wasn't a huge blockbuster, it was none the less a very enjoyable movie with a 'different premise' that drew on other movies to enhance the humor. There were many original twists and turns to the plot, and it ultimately does teach children a family value - the main idea to the whole story is that a mom and dad loses their son and are willing to do anything to get him back. Shows the importance of the traditional family.<br /><br />Finally, regarding some of the heated negative reviews - this is only a movie. It isn't that important and really is nothing to stress over. If you didn't like it, so be it. Read a good book.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I watched this twice, and I honestly never believed I'd see Elijah Wood's character upstaged, but it happened in this movie. The crazy Ukranian (Alex), played by the delightful Eugene Hutz, stole the show with his humor, unique mannerisms and choice of specific English words, adding depth to an already intriquing, emotionally layered film. If not for the humor, this story might've been too heavy. Whether you feel the ending is sad depends upon perspective. Perhaps the grandfather's burdened spirit was finally released after carrying a secret he kept hidden from his family and his own broken heart? This is another movie that has inspired me to read the book. Fantastic!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I really loved Transamerica, a heartwarming comedy/drama about a man in the midst of a gender transition who discovers that he fathered a son years ago.<br /><br />Felicity Huffman does a brilliant job of portraying Bree, the she male, and I quite liked her young male costar as well.<br /><br />The movie traces Bree's journey across country where she gets to know her son without letting him know who she is.  Of course, eventually she tells him and that leads to feelings of hurt and betrayal.<br /><br />The movie made me think hard about what it would be like to be born into the wrong body -- what a nightmare, compounded by ostracism and ridicule by society. Hopefully, the transgendered will be accepted more within the next several decades.<br /><br />This movie is a big step up from Boys Don't Cry or Normal in that both of those showed more pain than joy.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that I felt that Bree's clothing was archaic.  I know that she was supposed to be a conservative person -- a prude almost -- but I did not find that part to be credible.<br /><br />Otherwise, great entertainment.  Funny, touching, warm and leaves you with a good fuzzy feeling.<br /><br />Sigrid Mac
B00005JOFQ|5.0|After going through around 5 pages of review recently written on this movie, including the negative ones, I feel ashamed about how I viewed the world before I watched Brokeback Mountain.  <br /> <br />I feel ashamed because I discriminated homosexuality very strongly. For this reason, even after Oprah herself gave strong recommendations for the world to watch Brokeback Mountain, I still did not do it. In fact, the reason I bought the DVD in the first place is because the popularity of this movie only increased after months since the DVD release, and I didn't know what to expect. But after I watched it, I found myself crying uncontroably, mostly due to how I treated homosexual people in the past. <br /> <br />For what it's worth, this movie makes you a better person when you watch it, and you start recognize the injustice of this world, and of yourself, and begin to carry out life different. Highly Recomended!
B000002J1Y|5.0|As far as I am concerned, this live album from the Fragile and Close to the Edge tours is by far the most incredible display of virtuosity displayed on a live prog album. Period.  In fact, the virtuosity and the sheer ferocity with which they all play is both overwhelming and yet completely and utterly exhilarating.  As a huge prog fan I have listened to a lot of live prog albums, but none seem to top the raw beauty of Yessongs.<br /><br />Another property of this album that makes it a personal favorite is that the guys do not simply reproduce the studio works note for note or throw in gratuitous solos.  New sections are added to the original pieces and the solos are incredible works unto themselves.  In fact, listen to Chris Squire's awe-inspiring bass tour de force on The Fish - this piece alone inspired me to take up the bass guitar in the first place.  Rick Wakeman also presents a nice 6'35\\" synopsis of his then recently released solo album The Six Wives of Henry VIII.<br /><br />Bill Bruford had left Yes to join King Crimson and was replaced by Alan White on the Close to the Edge tour who had come from a strictly rock background.  Based on what I have read, Alan had a rough time with the material straight off (who wouldn't), but gradually got better with subsequent concerts.  I feel that his performances on Yessongs are quite solid - he plays on every track except for Perpetual Change and Long Distance Runaround/The Fish (Bill plays on these tracks).<br /><br />I should note that the sound quality of this album is not great (it is thin, trebly, and harsh), although it does not bother me in the least.  This is Yes after all and I would probably listen to the most poorly recorded bootleg over and over again without flinching.<br /><br />Like other folks I have great memories of this album and as I recall, rode my bike five miles to pick the album up from a local store.  In that it was 1979 or 1980, the triple album was still being issued on vinyl and was a very heavy thing.  One aspect of the Yessongs experience that I do miss is the incredible inner gatefold art of the original vinyl release along with the awesome color booklet.  With the huge triple gatefold, it was truly something to check Roger Dean's incredible artwork out while I listened to the music.  Although the artwork presented in the CD format does not quite have the same magic, the music still blows me away.  My hope is that Rhino will remaster this incredible gem because this version from Atlantic, although remastered, is not the best that it can be.<br /><br />All in all this is an incredible statement from an incredible band.  Very highly recommended with every fiber of my being along with all of their albums from 1971 - 1977 (The Yes Album through Going for the One).f the Yessongs experience that I do miss is the incredible inner gatefold art of the original vinyl release along with the awesome color booklet.

Im personally happy with my $40 purchase but feel that I should have waited for the Platnum release.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|In a private club that I participated in, many of my friends praise how creative the concept of Brokeback Mountain is, using an idea that will definitely trigger a response, and masterfully play with scenery and emotion to tune this response to one of adoration. <br /> <br />After buying this DVD, I find that creativity is not the only thing this movie has to offer. In fact, it is the least important aspect about this movie. This movie is created from pure emotion, crystalized into a masterpiece that everyone can watch, understand, and feel. Director Ang Lee is a true magician, and after watching the Hulk, also directed by him, it is clear that his skills in directing are improving. Can't wait until his next film comes out.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This DVD arrived at my mailbox on Thursday, but I have not had the time to watch it until today. After watching it, I am deeply impacted by the tragedy this film presents, and the beauty of this film.  <br /> <br />This movie shows how innocent love can start out to be, and how twisted the world can make it in the end. The most important part about this movie is how the characters are forced into marriage, but had to manage to their love. There is no other word to describe this movie, as it demonstrate true beauty, and humanity.
B000002ACR|5.0|The thing that's most impressive about the Byrds' best album - namely \\"Younger than Yesterday\\" - is that both Hillman and Crosby are finally afforded a greater opportunity to strut their stuff as up-and-coming singer/songwriters rather than continuing to play reluctant sessionman roles to group leader McGuinn.  In other words, a more \\"democratic\\" approach is employed on this stellar 1967 document ... <br /> <br />The best cases in point include the irresistable harmonies of Hillman's \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" and his melodic country-rocker \\"Time Between\\" as well as Crosby's wistful \\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" (this reviewer's favorite Crosby composition, by the way) and HIS dreamy yet up-tempo \\"Renaissance Fair.\\"  Incidentally, two more excellent Crosby tunes are added to the reissue - the ethereal \\"It Happens Each Day\\" and the melodically rollicking \\"Lady Friend.\\"  It does seems rather strange that the latter song features a Boyce-and-Hart-style horn section that nonetheless works brillantly - even for a Crosby composition! <br /> <br />As for McGuinn, his satiric opener \\"So You Want To Be A Rock And Roll Star\\" (which features Good Ol' \\"Grazin' In The Grass\\" Himself, Mr. Hugh Masakela on brass) and the hard-rocking \\"Why?\\" are first-rate, as is the inclusion of another Dylan classic (\\"My Back Pages\\"), also sung by McGuinn.  Unfortunately, though, the continuing efforts of each band member to have their own writings included on subsequent albums would eventually trigger the band's legendarily acrimonious break-up (especially on \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\").  If all this is too painful to even think about, then stick with Good Ol' YTY - one of The Byrds' (and 1967's) finest pop releases.  CIAO ...
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I can't afford an HD television and probably won't for quite awhile.  So the complaints I've been reading about regarding these new DVDs only having 1993 laserdisc quality don't interest me that much.  Obviously many of you would disagree.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I cannot, just cannot believe...How is an entire cd, every song, awesome? A two disc cd, at that? I have loved the Chili Peppers since middle school, I'm now 28, and this is just the best I've seen them at.  I hadn't read any reviews when I bought this album.  I had been eagerly anticipating it for months.  As soon as I heard the \\"Mars\\" cd, I said \\"Oh, this is an instant classic.\\"  And then I come to Amazon and everyone, except those who haven't gotten it YET, if they ever do, is saying the same thing. <br /> <br />I have my own theory as to why this double album is so great, aside from the fact that it's the Chili Peppers.  I know Flea and Anthony Kiedis, not sure about the others, are into meditation.  I meditate myself, and I've heard many times that any skills you already possess, will be heightened to almost supernatural heights when your powers of meditation increase.  I wouldn't be surprised to find out they've already reached enlightenment, from the sounds of this banger!   <br /> <br />If you love RHCP, don't think, just buy it.  You will not regret it!

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain was filmed with the intention of winning the Oscar's Best Picture of the Year, and not so much in sales. For this reason, this movie jump away from anything Hollywood, and dive right in to human emotion, love, and tragedy. In the end, though the Oscar board did not have the courage to give Brokeback Mountain the awards, the people awarded the movie with many time over in both Box Office and DVD sales than the Oscar winner, Crash. <br /> <br />This movie shows how, when someone can put their selfish reasons aside and concentrate on higher purposes, they can truly produce magnificent masterpieces such as Brokeback Mountain. We need more Ang Lee in Hollywood, so that movies will not be just actions to distract people, but messages that move people.
B0001CNRSE|5.0|I absolutely adored Honey--the film. I loved the romance that pursued between the barber shop owner and Honey. I loved the way she fought to keep her integrity and not get so caught up in wanting to \\"be someone\\" that she would sleep with her boss. And I loved that she used her talents to give back to her community in a way we only dream of. And I found the film alive with energy that left me leaving the theatre with a new sense of purpose. In fact, we own a copy of Honey and my daughter introduces all her friends to it, infact, one gal had to go out and get her own copy!
B000002MY3|5.0|I consider JAGGED LITTLE PILL to be the last great rock album, crafted just before any hack's store-bought rhythm machines replaced talented performers and rock degenerated into utter nihilism and gangsta rap.<br /><br />Alanis Morrissette is the Angry Young Woman whose whole life is a jagged little pill to swallow. Intensely personal lyrics and driving rock beats combine to produce some of the best, nakedly honest songs ever produced. In essence, JAGGED LITTLE PILL is the proud granddaughter of John Lennon's PLASTIC ONO BAND. Morrissette never falters as she screams, pleads, accuses, muses, reflects, and even jokes with the listener.<br /><br />\\"You Oughta Know\\" is the signature song, with two alternate mixes (one including the eerie \\"stalker\\" segment at the end). \\"You Oughta Know\\" is a scream of pain as she tears at the scab. This is literally THE Someone Done Somebody Wrong Song par excellence, and it defines the album. Who carries all this pain, and why? Is this all personal, or is it brilliantly, frighteningly universal? Or is it both?<br /><br />A splendid effort which just misses perfection, JAGGED LITTLE PILL marked what seems to have been the last gasp of Rock. Will it rise again? Stay tuned.
B000056HE9|3.0|cary grant as a visiting angel, david niven as an episcopal bishop, loretta young as his ignored spouse who falls in love with cary, who suffers the pangs of returning a love he knows is impossible to see through. i daresay this must have seemed a trifle risque 60 years back, but its not now, and its not charming enough or funny enough to be anything more than a pleasant footnote today, rather than the huge success it was in 1947. <br />
B000EBD9TY|5.0|If you're looking to upgrade to the Warner 2 disc special edition you might be in for a shock . It looks to me as if they've applied some noise-reduction filters to the 98 transfer. <br /> <br />So now you get a little less grain but its less sharper. <br /> <br />IMHO the original DVD transfer was better. <br /> <br />I give the movie a 5 however.
B0007OCG56|4.0|I wasn't sure how I'd like this film so I waited for it to come on video before I watched it. I found it rather pleasing and full of little life lessons that anyone could take away. Like that fact that if you don't tend to your marriage, you could find it slipping away and if you don't have enough strength of character, a love affair could occur. And that communication is a vital necessity in families, and without it, life is just one BIG chaotic mess.
B00005JP4U|5.0|Not only is \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" well done, but the picture it paints is frightening, especially the denial of scientific fact that is fostered by those who stand to profit from continued widespread use of greehouse gas-emitting products.  You should consider it your duty to see this movie and to cast your consumer vote to make it a resounding success.  Vote only for politicians who will fight for the US to officially sign the Kyoto Accords (instead of cities and states being forced to do it on their own!).  I want a wonderful planet for my children, grandchildren, an so on - I just hope you feel the same way.
B00005V9HH|5.0|yep, its obvious 20 minutes into the movie what the denouement will be, but i found this so skillfully done i give it a top rating. just wildly fun to watch as a heist movie, a genre i always tend to enjoy. the entire cast, led of course by kevin spacey, seems to have enjoyed itself. a guilty pleasure.
B00005JOVH|3.0|I am giving this three stars for the special effects, action, and some of the acting. If your a die hard comic book fan this movie will leave a somewhat bad taste in your mouth. I went to see this movie last night and it didn't really live up to my expectations. The beginning started off good and quickly took a nose dive for the worst. Characters that survive in the comic book are killed off abruptly in this film. I did not expect the film to stick with the comic like a blueprint but killing off main characters is blatantly wandering away from the films origin. It also didn't feel like the final installation of the trilogy. Some scenes leave an open-ended feeling. All in all, this was just an okay film. I wouldn't do backflips over it but it was decent enough to sit through.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Just read reviewer Johnny O comment, and I thought a previous reviewer was shallow... Apparently to this reviewer, men who do not love, and only go to bar and get drunk after work, and slober on every women passing by is what men should be.   <br /> <br />Good thing the majority of the world has evolved beyond that. Too bad there isn't a technology to de-evolve you back to ape.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|I won't go into the plot here since it is mentioned endlessly in other reviews. What I will go into is basic fact. Some have mentioned how bloody and violent this movie is, I've been watching horror films my whole life and I've seen bloodier and more violent films than this one. Alot of the violence occures off camera, what little you do get to see has been done a million times before in other films. In other words, the torture is not seen. Even in the 'Unrated' version. It is implied. My point is that if you want to see this for the gore you will be dissapointed. Only those not used to seeing these kind of films will find this bloody and horrifying. Those of you that have seen other gore films will find this stuff lite.  <br />Others have mentioned the sex in the beginning of the film. What sex? If it had at least that I would have given it a higher rating!  <br />I gave this 2 stars because the story is somewhat interesting. The execution is poor. It takes forever to get to the point. You may want to see this once, rent it, because you may not want to go back for a second viewing.
B000094HMU|5.0|I had seen several productions of Turandot prior to this one and they all left me cold. The costumes weren't interesting, the sets tended to be stylized and even the music seemed to be rambling and pointless.  I tried listening to the opera on CD, with much the same reaction.  Then, one night I happened to see this production on PBS and the opera totally changed for me.  Zeffirelli had somehow managed to pull this opera together and make it interesting to watch and to listen to.  Suddenly the opera seemed to make sense and I was drawn into the production. The entire cast was excellent and I disagree with a previous reviewer who felt that Leona Mitchell wasn't effective as Liu.  She was everything that one would expect an unnoticed slave strengthened by the power of her love to be.
B00008OLIO|5.0|I will try to make this short and sweet. This Motley Crue album is about as raw as it gets. The band pretty much played live, but without all the screaming fans. The whole album is awesome! It is as good as Dr. Feelgood but in a different way. It is worth it to buy.
B00005JP4U|1.0|Here we have Al Gore testing the waters for another run for the White House. He embarrassed himself in 2000, and if he tries again in '08 he will undoubtedly shame his family name once again.  History will view the Clinton/Gore years as a dark time for the U.S. - keep this man away from Washington!    Look, this is propaganda from a non-scientist. But I'm sure goose-stepping liberals everywhere will drive their gas-guzzling SUVs to view this affirmation of what they already believe. Who exactly is supposed to be convinced of anything by watching this? Anyone with common sense will surely seek more legitimate sources of information regarding global warming. But lazy so-called \\"progressives\\" will show up in droves for this, then pat themselves on the back for doing such a good deed...all the while participating in the same acts of natural-resource-draining over-consumption that everyone else does.  Hypocrits.    I'm not saying global warming is a myth or a lie. I'm not saying that environmentalism is a bad thing.  But I urge you to read, do your own research, draw your own informed conclusions.  Don't get your information from a former politician with an agenda.
0823016285|5.0|This book is extremely useful, not just for figuring out what different expressions look like, but why they look the way they do, including how the different muscles of the face function and change with age. Especially useful for me because I do a lot of drawing without immediate references, so understanding the anatomy of the face makes a huge difference in being able to visualize expressions.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|The majority of the time, once you reach that 2 hour mark, your saying to your buddy \\"Aight, when's this thing gonna end?\\" <br /> <br />Well this isn't one of those movies. I just wanted the film to keep going and going. But, sadly, it had to end. It's an amazing experience that will go down in film history forever. It has an amazing cast and amazing story. It's hilarious and sad at the same time.  <br /> <br />The story follows a young journalist's attempt for fame and recognition. He finally catches his break when Rolling Stone stumbles upon his writing and decides to give him a chance. His assignment: To write a story about Stillwater, the band he recently befriended. <br /> <br />The movie really has some amazing performances. Phillip Seymour Hoffman has an incredible supporting role. It really is one of his best performances of his career. It's very memorable. Billy Crudup, has the best performance of his career, as the troubled guitarist of the band Stillwater. Frances McDormand and Kate Hudson both have amazing roles. Patrick Fugit, William Miller, has the best performance as the troubled young journalist. The supporting cast is also very good. It includes: Jason Lee, Anna Paquin, Jimmy Fallon, and Noah Taylor. <br /> <br />The direction and writing of Cameron Crowe, are both flawless. That's basically all you can say about it. It's brilliantly done. <br /> <br />Also, if you can, buy a copy of the Untitled addition. It is OOP, out of print, but if you can find a used copy, buy it. In my opinion, the Untitled version is a much better experience. <br /> <br />I hope you decide to buy or rent the movie. Enjoy every second of the wonderful experience.
B00005R24K|5.0|THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUGHT A PURE HORROR MOVIE CLASSIC! IT IS COMPLETLEY FLAWLESS!! ACTING IS GREAT,VIOLENCE/ACTION IS INCREADABLE, AND THE STORY ITSLEF IS SHEER BRILLIANCE! SO STOP READING REVIEWS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU SHOULD BUY IT OR NOT, JUST DO IT! YOU WONT REGRET IT!
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 days is a masterpiece. Doesn't matter if you liked previous Tool albums or not or you're a fan or not. This album easily makes it into the top 10 of progressive rock, alongside with Pink Floyd, King Crimson and Genesis (w/ Gabriel).  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000VCZK2|5.0|All the Alien movies have enough scares in them to keep you up at night..... This box set has all the films and bonus discs that has great special features to keep you busy too......

B00005JNEI|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS VERY INFORMING AND IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE \\"SUPPORT OUR TROOPS\\" FOOLS THEN DONT WATCH THIS. ITS YOUR FAULT YOU IDIOTS! YOU SHOULDNT OF SIGN UP TO THE ARMY IN THE FIRST PLACE. I MYSELF THINK WAR IS POINTLESS AND SICKENING. AND THIS IS COMMING FROM A METAL HEAD! MIKE MOORE IS A BRILLIANT MAN AND THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE! BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE IS BETTER IN MY OPINION. IF YOU LIKED THIS FLICK THEN CHECK OUT BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. AND PLEASE DONT BE A FOOL TO THE ROTTEN SYSTEM. <br />
6305922756|3.0|This is Spinal Tap is a good comedy movie to watch for only one time.... Some of the reviews that i just got done reading gave it five stars,but i think in my opinion i think to me that the movie deserves only three stars i was hoping to get more laughs out of it... It's worth renting but on buying it i wouldn't watch this movie again and again.... But do check this one out for one time!!!!!!
6304907648|4.0|good movie but quite violent. Have not finished watching it because of that. I will watch it because it has to be a good movie.
B000002IMG|5.0|The New Order is one of those albums that I could listen to forever.  Every song is heavy and has a scorching performance from Alex Skolnik.  Eerie Inhabitants and Trial By Fire have very complex classical intros by Skolnik.  Into The Pit is the best thrash song, period.  The cover of Aerosmith's Nobody's Fault is incredible; it shows that Testament isn't one-dimensional, unlike much of thrash.  The instrumental Musical Death is very good, and showcases Alex's talent, like all the songs. <br /> <br />Testament has never gotten the recognition that they deserve.  Testament's classic sound is influenced by the early thrash bands, like Exodus, Metallica, Anthrax, and Megadeth.  Testament plays fast sometimes but usually keeps it at midtempo.  I highly recommend it to fans of thrash.  You won't be disappointed.   <br />
074322454X|5.0|If you have seen the series by the same name then you simply must read this book.  I have seen this series on several occasions and believe it is the best docudrama ever put to film.  While the producers of the series tried to stick to the facts as much as possible they could not resist adding a little hollywood to it.  By reading this book you get past the hollywood parts.  You also get a little bit more depth than the series can put on film while maintaining its flow. <br /> <br />In the series Sobel is a major prick.  In the book he is still a prick but not quite so bad.  In the series Lt Dike dies behind the haystack.  In real life he gets a promotion and lands a cushy job.  Webster is not resented by his Company when he returns instead he is always seen as dependable.  He may not volunteer for anything but he never tries to shirk his duties.  In fact he is turns down promotion on several occasions because he just wants to be a normal soldier.   <br /> <br />There are several more examples of this throughout the series.  Some are variations of stories.  Some are actual occurrences condensed into other people because there was not adequate time to introduce all the relevant people.  Most of the occurrences are forgivable and I stand by my 5 star rating on the series in spite of hollywood trying to improve upon actual history. <br />
B000063COX|4.0|Iron Maiden's debut disc was released in 1980.  That year was a huge year- Judas Priest, ACDC, Black Sabbath and  Ozzy Osbourne released classic albums.  However, Iron Maiden arguably is the best of the bunch.  All of the songs are classic, and have a very rock n' roll feel to them.  Paul Di'anno is a rough vocalist, and makes songs like Prowler, Sanctuary and Running Free very fun to listen to.  Phantom Of The Opera is the best song; it is a 7 minute epic that hints at the band's larger than life albums later in their career.  The recording is rough around the edges, but like Metallica's Kill 'Em All, it makes it more fun to listen to. <br /> <br />I recommend this album to all Iron Maiden fans.  However, if you are new to this band, you should start with Number Of The Beast or Powerslave.
B00005JOVH|4.0|X-men-The Last Stand is the 3rd movie in the X-men comic book movie franchise. It's a movie that's been getting both postive and negative feed back. X3 is the kind of movie whether it's a good or bad movie lies in your opinion and your opinion alone. Let me start by summing up the characters:  <br /> <br />Storm: I don't know where this Storm had a bigger role, had all the screen time came from because she did not what so ever. She had less than she did in X2 by far, and I'm not kidding. Her fight scenes were chopped off(The tidal wave from the trailer and another scene as well!!). But with that aside, this was easily Halle Berry's best performance in the trilogy and shows much improvement as Storm!!! Her action scenes are also amazing to watch. <br /> <br />Magneto: Ian does another outstanding job as Magneto!!! In this movie, he was a vicious tyrant and I loved him like that. When he destroys and levitates the Golden Gate Bridge, it was a jaw-dropping scene!! But you also feel sorry for the character by the end of the movie. Magneto truly is the best comic book villian to come on to the big screen!!! <br /> <br />Beast: Kelsey Grammar IS Beast; he was everything Beast should be and more. His action scenes were great to watch and the crowd went wild watching him. Sometimes he didn't even have to speak because the emotion on his face was perfect. The best new character by far...Oh my stars and garters!!! <br /> <br />Wolverine: This wasn't much of a Wolverine movie for once, I mean Wolverine had a lot of screen time but not as consuming as X1 and X2. Hugh Jackman has always been a pro when it came to being Wolverine and the way he saved the day in the end, was a powerful scene. <br /> <br />Jean/Dark Phoenix: Not what we expected I know, I know!! But Dark Phoenix is definately the highlight of this movie and Famke's performance as the tragic and powerful being was flawless. She easily stole all the scenes she was in. But the movie just doesn't represent the Phoenixor Dark Phoenix Saga that well at all, but her effects were mind-blowing. From her resurrection, to her neighborhood scene, and the final battle, every time she used her powers the audience was in AWH!!! <br /> <br />Professor X-WOW, just WOW!!! I won't go into detial about his fate but it was an emotional scene between him and Jean as they battle at her old neighborhood. Patrick is such an amazing actor and he plays Professor Xavier like he has played the character for years. Stick around after the credits to see Pro. X's fate!!! <br /> <br />Juggernaut: I'm the Juggernaut, B!*CH!!! LOL, that was the classic line from X3!!! I think they did Juggernaut justice enough, in that he is all muscle and no brain. I loved his action scenes and the way he through Wolverine around was so funny to watch. But I wonder what happened to him in the end. I hope he didn't die!! <br /> <br />Pyro: I loved Pyro in this movie; he was Magneto's right hand man and he made a really good villain!! His fight with Iceman was good but way too short to go into more detail. But, like Juggernaut, we really don't know what happened to him. <br /> <br />Iceman: Bobby was okay, I liked that he used his powers a lot more, and he ices up, YAY...which a lot of comic fans will be happy about. <br /> <br />Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat: I liked Ellen Page as Kitty and hope she stays with role. Her powers were so useful throughout the movie. She was funny, too. <br /> <br />Mystique: Such a great character, so little screentime!!! But when she was captured and was talking on different forms like the little girl that was so funny. But they should have done more with Mystique, since she is such a great character. But of course, short running time and all, sigh. <br /> <br />Rogue: UNDERUSED!!! Why oh why, hopefully she will regain her powers back in X4 because Rogue really got wasted in this trilogy, especially in this movie. <br /> <br />Cyclops: UNDERUSED!!! But Marsden did such a good job with what he had again. I just feel so bad for him in this movie he sees Jean again than puff, his gone....or is he? <br /> <br />Angel: UND....do I have to say it? Warren was such an interesting character and I wished we could have had more time to learn about him...uhhhhh!!! <br /> <br />Colossus: Wait...was Colossus in this movie? Oh yeah, in the Danger Room, in the hallway with the TV, and in the final battle for like a second. And what's funny is he had more lines in X2 than in X3!!! <br /> <br />Callisto: Thought she was cool, and she served her purpose!! <br /> <br />Quill/Archlight/Psylocke: Wasted characters that got...well....WASTED!!! <br /> <br />All in all, X3 was a pretty good movie!!! I give it a 4 out of 5 stars!!! I loved the opening sequence and think it was the best opening of the trilogy. Yeah, it had that rushed feeling throughout the movie, but it was still intense and emotional the whole way. X3 is a superior movie to X1, but of course, X2 was way better. It got a lot of reactions from the crowd. A guy behind me said it was the best of 3 movies and my cousin who was with me said the movie was wack. I can understand all the negativity and the disappointment for X3, this definately was a completely different movie than the first 2, and yeah, I think Bryan Singer's version would have been better...oh well, bring on X4, if there is one. <br />
B00005JP4U|5.0|I am a conservative (though not a Republican). I am also a skeptic. There have been--and are--several aspects of \\"environmentalism\\" about which I have been, and remain, skeptical or even hostile. For instance, I believe that recycling efforts tend to use more energy than they produce. Also, I believe that the discouragement of the use of D.D.T., worldwide, may have had disasterous consequences given the spread of malaria in those areas that did not undergo massive D.D.T. spraying; malaria has been virtually eliminated in the United States and Europe, where D.D.T. was used in large amounts, but continues to kill on the order of millions in Africa where it was hardly used at all. Also, I question the abridgment of human liberties in the name of certain causes, such as the protection of one species or another or the maintenance of some \\"pristine\\" environment. <br /> <br />That said, Al Gore, in An Inconvenient Truth, makes a clear and compelling case that 1) Global Warming is real, 2) We are responsible for it, 3) It will have disasterous consequences on our environment, and thus ourselves, if left unchecked. <br /> <br />For the most part, An Inconvenient Truth is the filming of a lecture that Gore delivers as a college seminar. We watch Gore as he provides study after study, statistic after statistic, to support his conclusions. He comes across as very well informed, reasonable, and sincere in his convictions. <br /> <br />The skeptic in me says that, there is probably \\"another side of the story.\\" I hope--and I believe that Mr. Gore would hope as well--that this film inspires people to try to learn as much as they can about this topic in order to reach an informed opinion. I personally plan on investigating further, and also to seek out that \\"other side\\" to see if it has anything meaningful to contribute to the discussion, but this film seems to have strong evidence which will not be challenged easily, if at all. <br /> <br />The conservative in me says that, whatever the truth of Global Warming, it is still a difficult question as to whether or not individual liberties should be curtailed in order to address it. And yet, if we lose the very Earth, then what do we have left to fight for? It's a difficult question that every conservative of conscience will have to deal with, should the science presented here bear out. <br /> <br />It is possible, where this subject is concerned, that we must rethink the label \\"environmentalism\\" and relegating concerns of Global Warming to one political party or another. We share one planet and are all affected by the changes we make to it. <br /> <br />In short, this is a strong movie. It is important viewing and, whatever your political or philosophical stance going in, it presents some compelling arguments that must be addressed. Despite the fact that I am both a conservative and a skeptic, I am not unmoved by this film's message; the evidence is out, the conclusions seem clear, and we must respond.
0975991477|5.0|I had the good fortune to meet and speak to Bruce Lipton before I even read his book. He is a dynamic and interesting speaker who doesn't try to overwhelm his audience with scientific jargon. If you get a chance to hear him, take advantage of it. <br /> <br />For those looking for Dr. Lipton to solve their personal problems, many of us do wish someone else could do that.  <br /> <br />Read the book with an open mind and use that information to examine your own beliefs and life style.  Then make the changes that seem useful or necessary to YOU. <br /> <br />Sounds selfish? If I am not happy within myself how will those around me experience me? If I AM happy within myself, it is contagious.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|I have to say guys, I have seen Cabin Fever and never before in my life have i ever regretted a movie so much that i wished to have that two hours of my life back. I watched Hostel because friends of mine wanted to and to be honest, it was actually pretty good. I mean, Im a 25 year old woman, and of course was offended by the charators crude sexual desires, but when  a friend told me they deserved what happened to them, i said \\"they werent murderes or pedophiles , they were just horny tourists!!!\\"  They were guys on vacation, in a liberating country where they could pay to do anything, little did they know while they were paying to have things to them sexually, there were business men paying to do things to them, by means of torture and killing.  The concept of the movie is genius, and you have to think of it that way, Eli Roth and Tarintino wanted to shock people by providing a movie like no other. Mission accomplished, soft porn and gore aside, the movie had an interested story, some pretty decent acting (most of the time) and even though i shut my eyes for the a good majority of the scenes, i still appreciated the essence of the movie. If your offended by this movie, plain and simple, dont watch it.  I am a horror movie fanatic, this movie grosses you out, tenses you up and keeps you in a suspenseful state, it is a VAST improvement for Eli Roth.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I added up all the money I spent on action figures, Legos, props, games, models, CDs, DVDs, video tapes, laserdiscs, cassettes, vinyl, box office tickets, lightsabers, comic books, magazines, cards, coins, posters, cups, glasses, ornaments, tooth brushes, hats, T-shirts, underoos, and assorted miscellaneous swag that I have purchased since 1977. I will be sending Lucas a bill for the settlement to be paid in full plus all accrued interest. I'm sure that's chump change compared to his billions but I want a refund because of damaged goods.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|For years, everyone(including myself) was waiting for Lucas to released the un-messed-with version of the original trilogy. Now we have it, and we are bashing it already? Why?! All I've read are complaints that Lucas messed with perfection, added things, and used technology to enhance an already great series of films. Now, he releases the originals with no frills and effects, and all I read are complaints?!  <br /> <br />\\"It's not in HD!\\" <br />\\"It's doesn't have 5.1 dolby or THX sound!\\" <br />\\"It isn't digitally enhanced!\\" <br /> <br />Isn't that what you wanted? The original, no frills and dressings added? I know it's what I want! And I can't wait!
B000BPK2OI|5.0|I went to school with him and other than being extremley talented he's a sweetie too. He's always been a great singer, it's so so wonderful that he's made it, this is wonderful for him. I am truly so happy for him and all that he's done for him self!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! God Bless =0)
B00005JOVN|5.0|I must admit, I've only seen bits and pieces of the original movie but this remake looked like a good adventure film so I decided to give it a try.  What I found was a really good thrill ride and its a pity that it hasn't done better at the box office!<br /><br />The director doesn't give us much time to blink before the rogue wave hits the huge cruise ship, killing a great deal of the passengers and turning the ship completely upside down.  The survivors, a small group who decide to try and find a way out of the ship, face one challenge after another.  You might think that the action would let up once the ship has been hit, but you would be wrong.  Wolfgang Peterson quicks the action rolling until the end of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is full of stars---Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and Richard Dreyfess, to name a few but the best action hero of the bunch is Josh Lucas, who gets the most harrowing sequences in the film.  The special effects are really good, especially as the wave hits the Poseidon as well as some of the shots inside the ship as it rolls over in the water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good popcorn movie with lots of action, this is one to see!  Not all movies have to have great plots or Oscar caliber acting to be enjoyed.  Sometimes you just need to sit back and enjoy the ride!  Don't let this one slip out of theaters before you see it on the big screen.  Well worth admission!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|When I was writing a review last time, there was  reviewer made some discriminating remarks on homosexuality. This provoked me right away. Many obviously felt it too since the comment was deleted by Amazon. Apparently enough people reported him. <br /> <br />Now there is a new comment saying that the characters and master director Ang Lee are mommie's boys, not real men. This obviously came from a simple minded man who believe that men are superior than women, and that men should become those alien creatures with no emotions we see everyday! Just because this film shows spirituality does not mean that these people are mommie's boys, and if they are, I think a world full of these people will be better than a world full of you!
B000003TA4|1.0|Worst album EVER!<br /><br />Remember when alternative gained mass appeal and a lot of us were naive enough to think that maybe the world would be a cooler place to live in when it happened?  It didn't work out that way, did it?  In fact, the world sucked even more afterward.<br /><br />The best thing that whiny overrated schmuck Cobain did was top himself.  Call it an eye for an eye.  Nirvana destroyed college radio.  Strangled it with a flannel shirt stolen off of Paul Westerberg's back.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|The biggest difference between Western Movies and Eastern Movies is probably that, while Eastern Movies shows turn of events, conflicts, and survival by clinging to the soul, Western Movie are mostly just Laughs, Anger, Fear, or Tears. Rarely are messages so woven into the movie that it cannot be understood, only felt. So I was quite surprised when I saw two major Western Movie stars acting out a movie that is so delicate. This movie, obviously, moved my very spirit, but I was more surprised to find that the western society is able to produce a movie with such degrees of beauty. Perhaps there are still hopes for the movie industry after all.
0143036238|5.0|I first watched the movie, never took any eager interest in british literature or period movies before. This movie just inspired me and I just had to buy Pride and Prejudice in this cover because I fell in love with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy and Keira Knightley as Miss Elizabeth Bennett. The book like any other publisher of Pride and Prejudice, they have the same contents although this book have some explanations at the back for words like \\"chaise and four\\" and etc. for people that never read books like this before. I love it so much so now I'm hunting for all Jane Austens' books and movies!!!
B00008IAMD|5.0|I have always been a fan of Johnny Cash, and nothing will ever replace the original albums, but this album is perhaps one of Cash's best albums. It offers new music with the old sound, but with a different sound. I recommend it to both Cash fans, and strangers to his music.

B00005JOVH|3.0|The first X-Men movie was, in my opinion, not a fantastic movie at all.  I'm no comic book junkie, but I'm a movie lover.  So of course, my expectations of X-Men weren't really balanced when I went to see the first movie.  It disappointed overall, and so I thought X2 would be just as bad.  To my surprise, X2 was astounding.  Perhaps one of the best Superhero movies ever made.  It had action, characterization, and overall good plot and story.  Even people who aren't X-Men fans could get into X2.  X2 still ranks as one of the finest comic book adaptations out there.<br /><br />Now we get to X-Men: The Last Stand.  Brett Ratner directed this one, and I won't say he did a terrible job.  I will say however, that The Last Stand doesn't hold a candle to X2: X-Men United. Let us clear up one little misunderstanding: This is not the last X-Men movie.  People will think so because it's called \\"The Last Stand\\" but it isn't the last in the movie franchise (which may be why they put that little extra after the credits).<br /><br />There is now a \\"cure\\" for the mutant gene.  Mutants have a choice as to whether or not they can take this cure.  Some mutants are thrilled by the chance to finally be \\"normal\\" others are outraged and crying out that there doesn't need to be a cure at all.  Even worse, the government has been manufactoring the cure into a weapon without saying anything to the nation.  And when Magneto finds out, all hell breaks loose.  Unless the government eradicates \\"the cure\\" Magneto promises a war.  And he delivers.<br /><br />But Magneto's war isn't the only thing going on in this film.  Cyclops is mourning Jean's death, but later comes to discover that Jean isn't dead.  In more revelations, Xavier admits that Jean is the most powerful mutant out there.  Except now Jean can't control her powers.  Her powers seem to control her.  The X-Men now have two problems on their hand.  A war that's about to break out, and dealing with class five mutant that's more powerful than anyone could possibly imagine.  And as Magneto's war carries on, the two problems soon merge into one massive disaster.<br /><br />It's hard to talk about the movie without providing a few spoilers.  New faces come on board for the newest installment of the franchise, but at the same time, a few have left.  For example: Nighcrawler isn't in the movie at all, and they don't even bother to explain where he went.  He's just gone. The new characters that come about though, are not in huge numbers.  Most of them join up with Magneto.<br /><br />When it comes to the characters in this film, however, there are a few things that urk me.  Old characters are changed.  We all know Wolverine used to be a tough guy who went at everything his own way.  He maintains going at things his own way, but his persona seems to have changed.  He's not ruthless and willing to stand at fight the way he used to.  It's a little distracting, considering what he went through to save those he cared about in the second movie.  Even worse, old characters get nothing to enhance the development started in the previous two films.  The new characters that come about get no development at all.  This is unforgiveable to those who enjoyed the character driven story of the second movie.  Here, it seems to be about the incredible special effects rather than the characters.  There's a lot of emphasis on what goes on around the characters rather than what's actually happening to them, and that's sad to admit.<br /><br />The characters don't just suffer in terms of development, they suffer in terms of acting as well.  The characters who returned to reprise their roles do a fairly good job.  Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are fantastic.  However, the real talent lies in Ian McKellen.  Single handedly, he carries to movie from start to finish.  It's amazing the man doesn't have an oscar yet, as whenever he's in a role, you look at him not as an actor, but as the character.<br /><br />However, as I said, the new actors who came on board are weak.  They act as though they have no direction.  Which brings me to the script.  A lot of the dialogue is corny and tacky.  When delivered from the cast that joins the X-Men roster, they even sound as though they were unsure of the script.  It's as if the director didn't care to work with them enough.  A lot of the new characters aren't really into character at all.<br /><br />The special effects are dazzling, though.  They look fantastic and play out extremely well.  Again, however, too much emphasis is put on the special effects.  There's little emphasis at all on the characters however.  It's hard to feel for the new characters introduced.<br /><br />The bottom line is simple: If you're a movie goer that loves a character driven story where you actually grow to shake hands with the characters and feel for them... this movie is simply not for you.  It clearly has summer blockbuster written all over it.  There are plenty of special effects and explosions, but hardly any substance beyond that.  Even the storyline feels a bit like an extra at times.  The war is given perfect emphasis, but we don't really go back and explore Jean that much.  It's to the point where you really don't care that she's become someone controlled by her own powers.  We don't learn enough about her dark side anyway.<br /><br />However, if you're one who loves to go to a movie just for the sake of having fun, I'd be lying to you if I told you you weren't going to find it here.  The movie is a fun ride.  The special effects are brilliant, and there's a comedic essence to the movie that makes it enjoyable to watch, despite some of the bad dialogue.  The final scenes of the movie are among the best.<br /><br />Overall, it's 3.5.  It's definitely a summer movie.  Lots of fun and excitement, but with little substance, and that's hard to admit seeing as how other super hero movies such as X2, Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins were willing to take that extra step that made you see them as more than just summer hits, but rather as actual films of acheivement.  X-Men: The Last Stand is a good movie, but doesn't take that extra leap that other superhero movies before it took.r />However, as I said, the new actors who came on board are weak.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I was excited to see this condensed version of P&P and relied on friend reviews. Previous to receiving reviews, I had planned not to see this version, because to me the BBC version was definitive. I was extremely sorry to find that this version is noisy, busy, and much less good than the BBC version. The lines of dialogue are chipped out, barely said, you can hardly tell who anyone is, except for Bingley's huge head of hair, and all of the participants seem to be born in a barn. The slamped-t0-the-head hairstyle is old now and particularly unwelcome in the Georgian period. Further, Donald Sutherland fails to convince as Mr. Bennett. The whole thing struck me initially as horrid and a waste of time, upon viewing it again, scene by scene, I still think it lesser than the BBC version, but liked it better. However, if you are interested in Pride and Prejudice, watch the full BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle first.<br /><br />Further, this version has none of the beauty or satisfaction of the original BBC version, plus, the screenplay takes huge advantage and abuses the story. So enjoy the barnyard version of P&P. There are beauties in this version, but not it's not quite as  satisfying as the A&E version.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Are you kidding me?...What the F is This?  First Heard Dani on the Cable Rock channel, and though never an RHCP fan, decided to pick this up due to the dearth in current rock music. What? a double album? WTF I'll pick it up as a best of with a few new tracks. Well...not a best of album. ALL NEW Material? WOW... Frampton Live, White Album teritory here. Great Rock Album(s).  <br /> <br />Thanks Peppers!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have always been a fan of Mariah Carey. But I must say this is my favorite CD by her yet. I love dancing around my house to it. It definately motivates me.
B000BVEKO0|3.0|They lost one of their best guitarists. You CANNOT expect this album to be the exact same! You thick headed morons, get that through your head! I do not want the same album twice. Sure this CD isn't that good(it's decent) but we don't want the same album twice. Quit bitching. <br /> <br />I'm a man of all around music(except country or jazz or some crap like that) just so you know. <br /> <br />1. Twisted Transistor - 4/5 - It's good the guitar is nice but it gets old after listening to it for a while. <br /> <br />2. Politics - 2/5 - Yuck. Not a good song. Those verses piss me off. <br /> <br />3. Hypocrites - 4/5 - Good song. Nice drums and guitar work.  <br /> <br />4. Souvenir - 5/5 - Great song! The guitar work is very cool even for nu-metal. <br /> <br />5. 10 or a 2-Way - 1/5 - This song sucks period. <br /> <br />6. Throw Me Away - 3/5 - Meh this song is decent.  <br /> <br />7. Love Song - 5/5 - Love this song. The chorus is catchy too. <br /> <br />8. Open Up - 4/5 - Good good. I like the beginning with that bass sound Korn has. <br /> <br />9. Coming Undone - 1/5 - Hate it. <br /> <br />10. Getting Off - 0/5 - Piss off this track sucks horribly. I hate their sex songs. <br /> <br />11. Liar - 4/5 - It's a great song but eventually it'll lose it's touch. <br /> <br />12. For No One - 6/5 - Awesome song! Great way to end the rock on the album! Definitely a good new Korn song. <br /> <br />13. Seen It All - 3/5 - These next two songs are basically no real music. Overall this song is okay. <br /> <br />14. Tearjerker - 4/5 - Good song even for just noises and singing. <br /> <br />15. It's Me Again - 4/5 - Good. <br /> <br />16. Eaten Up Inside - 6/5 - AWESOME. Love this song! <br /> <br />17. La Morte or whatever this song is - 2/5 - Eh.. <br /> <br />18. Twisted Transistor Dante Ross Mix - 4/5 - Good good. Love the Dante Ross Mixes. <br /> <br />19. Twisted Transistor Club Mix - 3/5 - 7 minutes of lame ass stereotypical techno music but still good. <br /> <br />The next songs I won't go over since they are live. <br /> <br />Well it's a okay CD. Don't buy this first if you're new to Korn. Baaad mistake if you do. <br /> <br />
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I don't think Star Wars fans are asking for much when they say they'd like the Original, unaltered Trilogy in anamorphic widescreen.  But instead, Lucas is releasing a version that is nowhere near up to par with today's DVD releases and is essentially trying to trick fans into believing that the OT is outdated and inferior.  Bull.  Give me a cleaned up, Original Trilogy over a CGI laden, Special Edition set any day of the week.  Like one of the previous posters pointed out, Mr. Lucas, Star Wars fans everywhere really are beginning to hate you.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|simply this cd to me sounds a lot like two early 70's albums # 1 being the first album by a group called bang and the first album by a group called dust. this to me is a good thing as i think both those albums were good and it is a shame most people will never hear them
0790733226|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the writings of Carl Sagan, but I found his foray into fiction only mildly interesting.  Happily, \\"Contact\\" is that rare instance when the movie is better than the book. It is worth the price of the DVD just for the awe-inspiring visuals of the opening sequence. The clever use of media sources for exposition, & the manipulated image of president Clinton (from his \\"Mar's rock\\" speech I believe) make it noteworthy. I also enjoyed the remarks by Ellie's \\"father\\" at the movie's end, as well as her testimony. In my opinion, this is Jodie Foster's finest role. If you're looking for a space alien shoot-em-up get Starship Troopers because this movie will dissapoint you - which may explain why this movie is often overlooked & under-rated. However, if you're in the market for a relevant examination of a \\"first contact\\" scenario, and some commentary on the media, politics, spiritual experience, and faith, then this might work for you.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|4.5 Stars. This is an outstanding movie. After viewing the majority of the most critically acclaimed movies of this year of any genre, this one definitely deserved to be a nominee for \\"Best Picture\\" at the Academy Awards.<br /><br />As a thriller, \\"Munich\\" is efficient, absorbing, effective. As an ethical argument, it is haunting. It opens with a heart-stopping re-enactment of the kidnapping and deaths of Israeli atletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. While many will remember the feats of athletes such as Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut and U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz (Spitz, an American of Jewish faith, had already won his record 7 gold medals before this tragic event and was advised to leave Germany after being warned that he was an inviting target for further terrorism and agreed with West German officials), others will be painfully haunted by the memory of this horrific act just 6 days before the games were to finish (competition was suspended for 24 hours).<br /><br />Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir states to her cabinet members \\"Forget peace for now\\". In her office it shows the formation of a secret Israeli revenge squad to kill those responsible. The film's most exciting moments are in the details of assassinations. Although the movie is just short of 3 hours (164 minutes), it will keep you riveted.<br /><br />The same debate is going on right now in America. If it is true that civilizations must sometimes compromise their values, the questions remain: What is the cost, and what is the benefit? Spielberg clearly asks if Israel has risked more than it has gained. The movies questions are not only for Israel but for any nation that believes it must compromise its values to defend them. I'm sure this type of question will be debated for years/decades to come.<br /><br />Note: Critic Roger Ebert gave this movie 4 out of 4 stars. Rolling Stone, 3 of 4 stars.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Once in a while, movie gem reaches out and touches your soul.  I have added this film to my collection of favorites, and those I will savor when I need a gut wrenching cry.  I was literally emotionally drained after watching it. <br /> <br />The story is set in Hell's Kitchen, among the despair of poverty and addictions.  A young Irish couple with their two daughters move to the neighborhood to try to establish a new life....overshadowed by the loss of their son at five years old. <br /> <br />I find myself drawn in the family, deeply sharing their anguish and triumphs.  One scene had me on the edge of my seat....at a street fair when the father is trying to win an ET doll for his youngest daughter.  I won't tell you the outcome. <br /> <br />The youngest daughter, Ariel, has a spirit about her, a curiosity and charisma which brings caring people into the fold of the family.  She is bold and unafraid, yet she yearns for the love of her father, who is emotionally distant following the death of his son. <br /> <br />The oldest daughter, Kristine, is wise beyond her years.  She successfully camptures life on her camcorder, which she uses constantly, almost a video diary if you will.   <br /> <br />The mother is strong and loves her husband with all her heart.  Her husband has shut her out of his emotionbal life, also, and she struggles to deal with that.  She is the glue which binds her family together. <br /> <br />Their neighbor, the \\"screaming man\\" of the building, is a tormented young artist.  The words on his door say it all \\"KEEP AWAY\\".  I won't give away the plot with his role. <br /> <br />A MUST SEE.....I cried, I stopped for a bit, I cried again.  I couldn't stop crying.  Okay, so I cried at Lion King, too...but that's beside the point.  I loaned this movie to my neighbor immediately after, with red puffy eyes.  She understands. <br /> <br />
1594200823|5.0|Very well written - holds your interest - and very, disturbingly, eye-opening. <br />For those of us with a conscience, this book is hard to take. <br />We are already a family that consumes Earth-produced foods, forsaking (obesity causing) processed and/or Fast food.  But now I'm ruined for food that comes from hog hell, hen hell, CAFO hell.  I am set upon obtaining our family's food from a local farmer, with the expectation that the inconvenience and extra expense will be off-set by the peace of mind of eating food that comes from animals that didn't suffer. <br />Ya know, it occurs to me, that with the all the money we could save by executing, rather than housing, feeding, and providing medical care to monsters from hell, like ye ol' Dennis Raider, we could afford (subsidize) raising our food animals under normal, rather than hellish conditions. <br />Dear God, it's all so screwed up. <br />Human intelligence:  NOW THERE'S A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS!!!!
B000EMGJM2|5.0|This album has it all.  It's like someone made me a mixtape of their favorite songs buts it's all by the same performer!  If you were disappointed by Van's sophomore effort, I suggest you should listen to it more than once before you pronounce it not as good as his debut.  The more I listen, the more I LOVE.  The man is ahead of his time, but yet deeply rooted by his past influences.  His voice is superb and the live shows are amazing.  I personally will buy anything he puts out, because it's so different from the pop crap that is so prevalent on the airwaves.  Congratulations Van Hunt on making this album YOUR way.  I love it and can't wait for the next one!!!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I'm rating this movie vs the theatrical version.  I thought this movie was much better on the special edition DVD than in the theater.  The theatrical version left too many gaps and questions which the director's cut DVD filled and answered.  Although not historically accurate, it was entertaining as a MOVIE.  If you want to watch a good NON-FICTIONAL documentary on the Crusades, I would recommend the Crusades DVD collection from the History Channel.  If you think this movie is an accurate depiction of the Crusades, there are many books you will find that prove otherwise.      The only thing that terribly bothered me was the way the Knights Templar were depicted.  Like raging, bloodlusting brutes.  In all reality they were warrior-monks that were revered by peasants, knights, kings and popes alike (until they were betrayed by a jealous pope and a bankrupt, envious king).
B0009298XY|3.0|This is a silly but somewhat funny spoof based on that seventies something television series by the same name, which starred Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky) and David Soul (Hutch) in the lead roles. In this film, Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson (Hutch), a pair of cops in the free wheeling, psychedelic haze of the nineteen seventies. Both are viewed as problem children by their superior officer and, consequently, are teamed up as partners. The film is really about how Starsky and Hutch met and became partners, something the television series never addressed.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is his usually wacky self as the straight arrow, by the book Starsky, while Owen Wilson positively shines as the laid back, irrepressible Hutch. Owen Wilson's natural comedic gifts allow him to effortlessly steal every scene in which he is featured. He is positively infectious! Snoop Dogg does a good job of reprising the role of Huggy Bear, the street informant that keeps Starsky and Hutch in the loop in terms of criminal activity afoot. Snoop Dogg infuses the role with a sort of natural cool and is funny in his own way, though not as endearing as the original Huggy Bear was in the television series. Still, he makes the role his own, as do Stiller and Wilson with theirs.<br /><br />The movie has a silly plot involving cocaine dealer/business man Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn, who injects the character with just the right amount of sleaze. It appears that Feldman has just come up with a new cocaine that will fool any drug sniffing canine. It is left up to Starsky and Hutch to stop his nefarious scheme, but not without getting themselves involved in some nutty situations along the way. Look for Justin Bateman in the small role of Friday, Feldman's sidekick. Will Ferrell has a small, but pivotal, role as Big Earl, a guy who has some information that Starsky and Hutch need badly enough to...well, see the film. Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, and Juliette Lewis round out the cast and provide the babe factor.<br /><br />The film is a retro look at the nineteen seventies from its fashions to its music. Look for cameo appearances by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. To my surprise, Glaser looks a whole lot better than David Soul, who appears not to have aged well. As to the overall rating of this film, I realize that this film may have limited appeal. Those who liked the Starsky and Hutch television series or who are fans of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson will probably enjoy this goofy, spoofy, sophomoric little film.wis round out the cast and provide the babe factor.<br /><br />The film is a retro look at the nineteen seventies from its fashions to its music.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|No question that Octavarium is a good, solid Dream Theater album. One of the best in fact. Yet for the premier progressive rock group in the world, they don't seem to be progressing very far - look through their back catalogue and find all the pre-packaged ingredients for Octavarium (maybe in a different time signature).Dream Theater, having established and mastering modern progressive rock, seem content on broadening its scope, rather than moving the genre in a new direction. <br /> <br />Panic Attack is the pick of the album, an intelligent song relevant to todays politics. Similarly impressive is the atmospheric Sacrificed Sons, a reflection on September 11 that doesn't reek of tosspot patriotism. Walk Beside You is fairly catchy, but don't crank it too loud lest someone hears you listening to it. These Walls is also a highlight, LaBrie's vocals really have matured in the last few years.  <br /> <br />The obligatory super epic monster track, 'Octavarium' reminds me of Pink Floyd for some reason at the start (by start I mean the first 8 minutes). Its all technically impressive, but forgettable. <br /> <br />I was particularly impressed by Jordan Rudess in this album, mainly because of his restraint. His keyboards serve to add depth to the songs, rather than dominate. Not that there's anything wrong with dominating mind you.  <br /> <br />Any fan of progressive rock will buy Octavarium, as they should - just to see how progressive you can be without actually going anywhere.
B00006V9A0|5.0|It's been the better part of ten years since Kurt Cobain killed himself, and the music charts are now in a sorry shape. It's only poetic justice, I would think, that Nirvana would suddenly come back to life to send one last single up the charts to show them all how it's done. Accompanying this last single is this excellent compilation - so excellent, in fact, that all the usual criticism reserved for compilations fails to apply. Even the cover is perfect - \\"Nirvana,\\" no other words need be said, the band's name and reputation speak for themselves.<br /><br />Let's face it: Nirvana's albums weren't perfect. Nevermind, for all the ground it broke, was basically a singles album, and In Utero was a deliberate attempt to shed their audience with ugly production and cacophony. But we forgave them their faults thanks to the freshness of the former and the brutal sonic force of the latter - and, of course, thanks to Kurt Cobain's charming insouciance. This compilation, however, collects all the best parts of both. And when I say \\"best parts,\\" I do mean it. All the mainstays are here - \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" \\"Come As You Are,\\" \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" - but so are other songs that one wouldn't have thought likely choices for a compilation - \\"Rape Me\\" and \\"Dumb.\\" Yes, they even included \\"Dumb\\", quite possibly Nirvana's best song ever! \\"About a Girl\\" makes an appearance here too, possibly the result of an attempt to include _something_ from Bleach; I suppose it'd have been better if they had picked the unplugged version, but the unplugged album gets represented here too - the beautiful cover of \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" is here. There are even a couple of relatively obscure gems off Incesticide - the funny childhood story \\"Sliver\\" and the terrific \\"Been A Son.\\"<br /><br />Then there's the new song - \\"You Know You're Right,\\" apparently the last song the band ever recorded. I don't think it's the best song they ever wrote, but it is in a way very definitive - it combines the loud/soft dynamics of Nevermind with some of the more ear-splitting moments of In Utero in the chorus. Cobain's voice in the verses is amazing - the bitterness and proximity to collapse are almost tangible - but it's the bridge to the chorus, in which he simply roars \\"pain,\\" that's really remarkable. It is moments like these in which one understands why Nirvana's music still reaches so many people - with a roar like that with you, you can go take on the world.<br /><br />His great pop talents aside, Cobain was not exactly the second coming of Keats. He was in many ways a product of, and poisoned by, the atrophied anticulture of the ennui-ridden youth of the postmodern age. However, talent will make itself known in any milieu; what made him stand out was his complete awareness of this, his inability to succumb to it or take it lying down, his resulting sadness and rage, and his remarkable ability to convey his emotions, even if his words weren't always clear. Thus we got moments like the wonderfully vicious \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" the melancholy \\"Dumb,\\" the resigned \\"All Apologies\\" or that everlasting anthem of all rejected outsiders, \\"Lithium.\\" And by this alone, it could be said that he left the world he railed against in better shape than when he entered it.soft dynamics of Nevermind with some of the more ear-splitting moments of In Utero in the chorus.

B000002UR7|2.0|Let's get one thing straight - Radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles.  That said, this is not the album for that reason.  Do not let this album turn you off from Radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about.  There is one hint though in where Radiohead will go.  In the song \\"Creep\\", which is not a fantastic song, there is a brilliant \\"CHU-CHUNK\\" made by Johnny Greenwood.   SO PLEASE - IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO RADIOHEAD...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  For the \\"rockers\\" - get THE BENDS, for people trying to expand their musical mind - get OK COMPUTER, and if you like that you may become obsessed with KID A.  There are some unbelievable songs on AMNESIAC, but it is not their most cohesive album, and HAIL TO THE THEIF is very solid.  Thank you for your time.
B000067CPX|4.0|Even if this release hasn't achieved the success of Californication in US, still remains one of the best moments of Red Hot Chili Peppers<br /><br />For the avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, this CD has been eagerly awaited since about 2 weeks after the release of 'Californication'. Perhaps one of the best CDs of the past decade, 'Californication' represented the band's arrival on to the mainstream rock charts, and was able to appeal to a wider audience without upsetting the more traditional fans who grew up on 'Mother's Milk'.<br /><br />The early release of the single 'By The Way' suggested a cross between the hard-hitting riffs of 'Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik' and the more melodic style of 'Californication'. However, the CD is far from what was expected - tracks 2-6 contain far from subtle drug references and feature a fairly 'trippy' sound, while songs such as 'Can't Stop' and 'Minor Thing' see Anthony Kiedis following Live frontman Ed Kowalczyk in moving towards disjointed rap-like vocals.<br /><br />At the same time there are the soft, touching anthems for our generation that we've come to expect from R.H.C.P. Songs like 'I Could Die For You', 'Dosed' and 'Tear' are powerful, near tear-jerking songs. And, to add a further spice to this unusual combination of tracks, a distinctly Latin influence plays a part in 'Cabron' and the remarkable end to 'Venice Queen'.<br /><br />All in all, this is a genuinely stunning collection of songs which should impress die-hard Chili Peppers fans because it avoids the recent trend in rock music towards catering for the teenie-bopper collective, who swarm from group to group like maggots on faeces.<br /><br />Finally, this is definitely one of those CDs that should not be judged after the first hearing - instead make sure you've run through the entire CD at least 4-5 times so as to get a better feel for the music.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is still the best comic book movie.  (Spiderman is #2 to me).  The 1990's \\"Batman\\" movies  to me were just awful.  This tells us the Story of \\"Superman\\" from the begining (something that the Batman Movies just started) and we grow to care about Clark Kent and then we care about Superman even more.  Now I hope that WB when they release the DELUXE BOX SET OF \\"14\\" DVD'S they will give us that 45 minutes of footage that was added to the Network TV Showings.  IF you have never scene this movie then your in for a treat.  THE Special effects still hold up. The story is timeless.   Christopher Reeve should have won an oscar!
B00000J7JO|5.0|Californication is a simply amazing album by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They try on many different styles here in this album, and seem to excel at all of them.<br /><br />The opening song on Californication, \\"Around the World\\", is a great funk tune. Many more such songs can be found here, such as \\"Get on top\\". The driving bass of these songs serves as a steady foundation on which John Frusciante lays down an array of memorable guitar riffs. These fun tunes seemingly lay a foundation for the ups and downs of this album.<br /><br />The beauty that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have created in their mellow songs is astounding. They take elements of their funk such as the driving bass and drums and combine it with beautiful choruses and guitar to leave you in awe of their musical genius. The mellow pieces of this album, such as \\"Otherside\\", \\"Scartissue\\", and \\"Californication\\" will remain with you for a long time.<br /><br />Another interesting style is an acoustic Zeppelin-esque tone in \\"Road Trippin'\\". The Red Hot Chili Peppers make this style their own by taking their mellow style tunes and layering it with acoustic guitar and a symphonic backdrop.<br /><br />This was my first Red Hot Chili Peppers Album, but it certainly will not be my last. I definitely reccomend this album to everyone, because what sets this album apart is not that it contains so many different styles, but how the band can seemingly take any style and make it their own.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This is the movie that started it all.  Without \\"Halloween\\" there would not of been \\"Elm ST\\" or \\"Friday the 13th\\".  THis movie inspired the \\"Scream\\" movies as well.  This is a simple movie.  A bad man escapes from a psycho-ward after being there 15 years.  He goes to his old home town for his own tyoe of homecoming!  Not to be missed.  Now its been almost 30 years since this movie has been released and nobody can think of \\"Halloween The Holiday\\" without thinking of this movie!<br /><br />You can't go wrong with Anchor Bays New Blu-ray of this classic film.  The transfer was approved by the original Director of Photography Den Cundey.  However in terms of new extra it was nice to hear a NEW AUDIO COMMENTARY from the director John Carpenter and star Jamie Lee Cutis.  If you have a previous DVD (or Blu-Ray) then audio commentary on that DVD was recorded in 1994 for the Home Video Premiere of the film in the Widescreen format! Criterion Laserdisc release. That original commentary is still one the best ever however the new commentary does have a fresh approach. This time John & Jamie are sitting together watching the film.  In the previous commentary they were both featured but they were recorded separably. In the original commentary John Recorded his along side \\"Halloween\\" co-writer  Debra Hill.<br /><br />In the future we know there will be some sort of new release. What would be nice if that future release included the \\"FOUND FOOTAGE\\".  This footage includes the original  take in which Laurie Talks to Annie on the phone (After spotting Michael in the clothes line)  and the original ending.  Also what it might include is the \\"Alternate Take\\" of Dr Loomis reaction to Michael's disappearance act.<br /><br />Also rumors are abound that there might even be more footage that was shot for the television edition.
0553801503|1.0|Maybe this series is getting milked for cash, but it is apparent that this author loves to write.  That is commendable and it does deserve recognition.  However...   <br /> <br />What I mean by the title of this review is that I got the sense throughout reading this novel that George is writing this for himself more so than for his readers.  Remember your class with that instructor who clearly had a true passion for his/her work but just taught over the heads of students?  Read \\"A Feast For Crows\\" and deja vu will smack you upside the head.   <br /> <br />This book expands its universe rather than focusing on any sort of resolution.  The fourth book in a series, however, may be a little late for breaking new storylines wide open.  This book is crammed with filler chapters, which again suggests that the author loves his work too much to consider serious editing to sustain the reader's interest.  For instance...   <br /> <br />Queen Regent Cersei hatches a plot to remove Margaery Tyrell (who?  Oh yeah, her) from queen-to-be while still holding the Highgarden alliance.  Interesting for a chapter?  Definitely.  Interesting over 400 pages?  If you haven't read this yet, does that intrigue you to the point of purchase?  Here is a case where George clearly didn't say to himself, \\"If I was a reader, would I lose sleep over the fate of Margaery Tyrell?\\"  In Brienne's instance, she dukes it out with Biter (who?  Oh yeah, him) near the end of the book.  Here again, did George sit back and ponder, \\"If I was a reader, would I feel satisfied after reading over 100 pages from Brienne's POV to arrive at the conclusion that Biter is a mean guy?\\"  This also sets up poorly for Brienne's POV chapters in next decade's installment--\\"Oh, I wasn't beautiful before, and now look at me!  Maybe I shouldn't have taken up this life...\\" etc.  Boom!  That's probably 30 pages-worth of lamenting right there.  Fun for George, but do you want to read through it?  And jeez, why doesn't George give Samwise the boot?  Perhaps it's because George likes writing from Sam's perspective!  Doesn't he ask himself, \\"Hmmm, despite Sam being the only one to ever slay an Other, would my readers be cool with me dismissing that and going back to the old Sam who get spooked by the sound of his own butt-sneezes?\\" <br /> <br />I could go on with listing examples, but ironically enough, chances are my review would end up being as boring as the very novel I'm knocking.  If you'd like advice from a reader's perspective, read the cliffnotes on this one, buy the next book, and hope that things improve.
0143034901|3.0|Several magazine review blurbs (Elle, NYT Book Review, Orlando Sentinel, Wash. Post) on and inside the book's covers compare The Shadow of the Wind to the writings of Borges.  The comparison is unfair to Borges.  Any similarities are superficial only.  Aside from a story revolving around books, a couple of references to labyrinths, and the Spanish language, there is no resemblance whatsoever.<br /><br />The better comparison is to the movie Animal House.  The Shadow of the Wind should have ended at page 471, at most, when all essential matters have been resolved.  Instead, the book drones on for 16 more pages, which include scenes of a hooker smuggled into a hospice and a where-are-they-now follow-up for almost all of the characters, even the minor ones.<br /><br />The book is too long.  Strangely, Zafon seems aware of this, but he does not do much about it.  In three places, what would be long interviews between Daniel Sempere and other characters are instead summarized by long narratives in italics:  the interview with Molins (pp. 125-129); the interview with Fernando Ramos (pp. 204-215); and the interview with Jacinta (pp. 260-278).  The substitution of these summaries for real dialogue suggests both that Zafon is aware that the reader might be on the brink of snoozing and that Zafon wants not so much to impart relevant plot information through characters as to give the reader the effect of a movie flashback.<br /><br />Weirdly, however, Zafon is inconsistent about the use of summaries and of the italicized portions.  Chapter 5 of the Nuria Monfort narrative, for example, is entirely italicized, which is especially strange since the narrative is supposed to be handwritten.  Even some dialogue in the Nuria narrative, such as that of Sanmarti and Fumero, is italicized; but not all of the dialogue in the Nuria narrative is written that way.  On the other hand, Anacleto's recounting of Federico's arrest and prison assault is not summarized in italics, although that recounting is at least as good a candidate as any of the interviews to be a summary.<br /><br />The book has too many characters.  The book's central concept dictates that there will be some duplication.  That concept, that the events of Daniel's life parallel the events of Julian Carax's life, means that each character in Daniel's life will have a counterpart in Carax's life.  But in the story of Daniel's life itself there is unnecessary duplication.  Daniel's story does not need two comic figures:  Fermin and Federico.  His story especially does not need three love interests:  Clara, Nuria, and Beatriz.  (The translator's father might have had a few remarks about this Triple Goddess motif.)<br /><br />Even in a fantasy the particulars should be plausible in order to sustain the fantasy's temporary believability.  Zafon, however, is too loose and free with his language, descriptions, and plot twists.  Russian dolls are not \\"innumerable\\" (p. 7); they are just numerous.  Revealing that Julian has a female half-sibling and her identity toward the end of the book (p. 377) only lessens sympathy for Julian's loss of the object of his love by making it incestuous.  Daniel is lying down after he is shot (pp. 464-465).  How is he then supposed to have seen both a body thrown from the window on the upper-story, where he is lying, and the actual event of death below (p. 465)?  Each of these lapses hurts the story; each could have been avoided.<br /><br />Plausibility of particulars is especially important with the Nuria narrative because the very existence of the narrative strains credulity.  Here the book fails.  The Nuria narrative is supposed to be handwritten (p. 357), yet it takes up 48 of the book's pages (pp. 359-446).  Are we supposed to believe that Nuria sat in her apartment and scratched out such a long narrative while her Underwood typewriter (p. 165) sat next to her unused?  How would the enormous italicized portions in her narrative, described earlier, be represented in handwriting?  With underlining?  How about all capital letters?  And just how big (and heavy) is the envelope supposed to be that Daniel is hauling around containing all of these handwritten pages?<br /><br />In his typical fashion, Borges would have dispatched with this book's story in 10 pages not by writing the book but instead by imagining that the book exists and then writing a synopsis of it.  That would have been an improvement.  In fact, a two-hour TV movie version would be an improvement.  Zafon seems either to wish he were writing a screenplay or to be giving directions to some future screenwriter adapting the book.  A movie would at least eliminate the distracting subplots and minor characters.  Clara Barcelo and Adrian Neri would be eliminated.  Clara's uncle might make a brief appearance, but only to offer to buy Julian's book from Daniel.  Federico is expendable; by implication, so is Anacleto.<br /><br />Until the movie comes out, read Ficciones.out all capital letters?

B00005JP4U|5.0|It's a bit odd to go into a darkened movie theater--the scene of American escapism for the last one hundred years--to receive such a brisk wake-up call. Still, watching this movie in a theater with hundreds of strangers is, I think, the best way to view it because we are all in this together. <br /> <br />If you've been politically aware in the last 10 years, chances are there isn't any one fact in this movie that you haven't heard before. It is a shocking movie nonetheless, and the shock comes from seeing all those facts marshalled together, presenting a clear-cut case. Here's the inconvenient truth: the earth is getting warmer, that our actions are the reasons why it is getting warmer, and that we must all work together to solve this problem or else it will become a crisis for humanity. <br /> <br />The good news is that there are things we can do now that will hopefully avert or diminish the coming havoc, but the first step is learning about the problem. Even though this film is intercut with scenes that often feel like a Al Gore political ad, it's the best way for most people to learn about this problem. The data is explained in easy-to-digest graphics and examples.  <br /> <br />I urge you to see this movie. Take your parents, take your kids. Let's save ourselves before it's too late.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Everything in this album is great. First off, no album i know has had so many quality tracks. I went on holiday last week and listened entirely to this amazing album. In fact i barely got started on Mars, Jupiter was so good. <br /> <br />Amazing tracks: <br />Dani California (Pure Brilliance), Snow (Great tune and lyrics), Charlie (not sure about lyrics, but great chorus), Stadium Arcadium (slow but speeds up),Torture Me (Just love it), Strip My Mind (Great tune), C'mon Girl (No idea why). And thats just Jupiter.... <br /> <br />haven't started mars yet but this could well replace By The Way as my favourite album. <br /> <br />2 things: <br />Dont give up on any tracks, i warmed to them over time. <br />Only review if you are a real chili peppers fan, plz <br /> <br />Worth every star
B000E33VWW|3.0|Capote is a broken, self-absorbed, and narcissistic individual. From the start, we see that he is drunk on his fame and accomplishments, and that he has lost his sense of perspective. He presides over cocktail conversations much to the delight of his listeners; but as intelligent and charming as is, he is convinced that his universe takes precedence over everything else -- even the lives of others. The inner termoil that results from this delusion is the basis of the film, Capote -- a character study of an ego that crowds out the life of a tormented soul.  <br /> <br />Hoffman's performance alone is reason enough to watch this movie, but prepare yourself to be pulled down by the weighty subject matter and its deliberate pace.
B000EGCITG|2.0|Well for someone who claims to be alive and kicking, this album is selling worse than her last one. And that one was considered a bomb. Despite her Stupid Girls single which was somewhat well received (more for the video than the song)this album is failing to shift units. <br />I think Pink should look deep and know why. <br /> <br />She takes shots at Paris Hilton, Lindsay, Britney, Christina, yada yada yada...for their brainlessness and selling themselves as sex objects as opposed to talented figures. She feels she's giving young females an alternative. <br />The truth is, they know they have an alternative and they don't need some hypocritical Lady Marmelade hooker to tell them so. <br /> <br />Also featured on the album is the Bush bashing \\"Dear Mr. President.\\" It was nicely performed and written, but Pink is 3 years late to jump on the Bush bashing bandwagon. Honey, if you're going to be in pop music you gotta learn to milk the cows before dawn. <br /> <br />Then there's a song that torments us normal working folks. \\"Cuz i can\\" features Pink making us 9-5 working people feel like garbage because she \\"can fit our whole house in her swimming pool.\\" Yes aren't you a warm individual. And you're not a stupid girl yet money seemed to get to your head over your intelligence. If you were as smart as you claimed you would realize that the love of money is the root of all evil. Hypocrite. <br /> <br />Now, if this doesn't wake Pink up as to why her album is selling, then she might as well start making some smart investments otherwise we may see her on the streets being a real hooker. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00062J00S|2.0|What a charming and heart-warming piece of movie history this is. It's nice to think what a positive difference we can make to other peoples lives without realising it! I am truly touched every time I see this film. Unfortunately I am forced to deduct three stars as the film is in black and white.
0312323867|5.0|After reading about Darcy in the first book I was not sure how I would connect with a spoiled little rich girl who seemed to be taking being pregnant for granted.  Something Blue began with Darcy having the same attitude that she had in Something Borrowed, feeling that the whole world owed her something, but after her only friend left tells her like it is she slowly begins to change.   <br />I did not think that I could ever love this book more than the first one but I honestly finished it in 24 hours.  I hated Darcy in the beginning, but by the end of the book I wanted so badly for her to be happy.  Any book that can make you get that involved in the characters life is a book definetly worth reading.
B00007FOMP|1.0|A perennial favourite of the chattering classes, I purchased this hoping for some high quality soul music of a similar style to the excellent Lighthouse Family - sadly there is no comparison. Firstly there are only 9 songs compared to a whopping 17 on the Very Best of the Lighthouse Family, so it's easy to see where to go for value for money. Secondly, Mr Gayes' anti war sentiments seem somewhat naïve and foolish in today's political climate. Thirdly, Mr Gaye can't sing and has to resort to shock tactics such as singing in a high voice like a lady in order to sell records. No wonder his career ground to a halt in the early 80's! Verdict: avoid.  <br /> <br />
B00005JMYI|5.0|In the book, there were a lot of subtle details that the author included. They all had a reason. For instance, Vivian and Morgaine, both of fairy ancestry, should be shorter than most people, not taller, as with the movie. Also, the women of Avalon, when riding abroad, wear men's breeches. There's a reason for this. Morgause is not an evil sorceress. Neither is Mordred an evil person. The term Merlin is a title, not a name. The priestesses of Avalon do not dress in gaily colored clothes. The sacred well is actually sacred, and not to be treated like some weathered magical artifact. There are numerous other details, others not so subtle that have either been altered or cut out altogether.  <br /> <br />I agree with a previous poster about how the true victims were the actors and actresses of this movie. The scriptwriter probably had to acquiese to either the producer, director, or studio managmenet. How else could any writer, novice or professional, think to leave out or change some of the most important parts of the story? Nothing worked. Not the love between Igraine and Uther. Not the love between Lancelot and Guenivere. Not Arthur's love for Guinevere and his companions. Not Morgaine's love for Lancelot. Not Viviane's commitment to the Goddess. Not the Merlin's or Raven's devotion. Not the sanctity of the Beltane rites. Not the sacredness of Excalibur, of the Holy Regalia of Avalon. Not even Mordred's inner conflicts. He's not evil, only conflicted. Imagine being the son of the High King and not being acknowledged for it because some priests consider it heresy. Imagine the pain the High priestess of Avalon, the Lady of the Lake, had to endure in order to keep Avalon alive. The \\"solo\\" passage through the mists should have been the culmination and greatest test for any priestess. Lastly, who in their right mind would change the ending to any great book? That is the utmost in presumptuousness.  <br /> <br />I am very dissappointed with this movie. Many points and details in the story have either been changed or altered. I do not blame any of the actors or actresses. They did their best for such a mediocre production. Like the Lord of the Rings, Marion Zimmer Bradley's adaptation of the Arthurian legends should have been broken up into three separate movies, each about three hours long. Maybe then can we all truly enjoy the story of The Mists of Avalon.  <br /> <br />This movie was not The Mists of Avalon. It is a different story altogether. How I wish I hadn't seen this under the pretext of MZB's book. If you truly want to enjoy this story, please read the book instead. This movie may have been made for TNT, but that doesn't excuse it's poor quality. We should never lower our expectations for any story. We should hold storytellers, print or film, to the highest standards. And we should never butcher a good story for the sake of corporate entities. <br /> <br /> <br />Uhhh, I like lamp. grrrrrrrrrrrr

B000067DNC|5.0|There have over the years been a number of great shows that followed a good first season with a great second one, including THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and FARSCAPE.  There are a variety of reasons for this in each case.  With STARGATE, it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates.  Season One was basically your stargate-of-the-week format, each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode.  This is the format usually preferred by network executives, since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background.  Serious fans, on the other hand, vastly prefer the complex storylines, where each week's episode does not stand on its own, but is embedded in an ongoing saga, almost like a chapter in a huge novel.  This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy, though my own hope is that the success of shows like LOST will pave the way for more complex formats.<br /><br />Season Two does not tell a single unified story the way that FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did, but it does start spinning out a largely political struggle about the five races (only a few that we have met by the end of the season) aligned against the Goa'uld.  The STARGATE story by the end of Season One was still a relatively simple affair; by the end of Season Two it was already sufficiently complex as to make following the details difficult for a newcomer.  But it was not only the season long arc; the individual episodes improved in quality as well as the writers came to know the characters better.  All in all, the improvement in the show from Season One was not unexpected, but it was delightful nonetheless.<br /><br />The only sour note in Season Two was the season finale.  Most shows try to build up to a dramatic season-ending episode that both sums up everything that happened in that season and propels the show into the next one.  The season finale for Season Two of STARGATE has to be one of the lamest ever devised.  Most of the problem is that most of the episode was constructed of segments of previous episodes that were simply replayed.  STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION used this method a few times.  My guess is that the latter show used it as a cheap way of creating a new episode.  If 20 minutes of your air time consisted of clips from old shows, then you had dramatically lowered your operating budget.  I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale, though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap.  Nonetheless, it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season.<br /><br />As with Season One, the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG-1 team, with all other character functioning as supporting characters.  We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons, the most important being General Jacob Carter, Samantha's father.  His importance to the show is cemented in the two-part episode that introduces the Tok'ra, a group rebel Goa'uld opposed to the regular Goa'uld, only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts.  Since Sam's father is dying of cancer and the Tok'ra Selmak's host is dying, he is approached to become a host, since Selmak can cure the cancer.  This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season, when Sam's father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut.  Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program, he can't understand why she has no interest in going into outer space.<br /><br />All in all, this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci-fi series that television has seen.  Although I've never forgiven the Sci-fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE, keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes.and propels the show into the next one.

I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale, though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap.  Nonetheless, it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season. <br /> <br />As with Season One, the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG-1 team, with all other character functioning as supporting characters.  We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons, the most important being General Jacob Carter, Samantha's father.  His importance to the show is cemented in the two-part episode that introduces the Tok'ra, a group rebel Goa'uld opposed to the regular Goa'uld, only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts.  Since Sam's father is dying of cancer and the Tok'ra Selmak's host is dying, he is approached to become a host, since Selmak can cure the cancer.  This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season, when Sam's father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut.  Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program, he can't understand why she has no interest in going into outer space. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci-fi series that television has seen.  Although I've never forgiven the Sci-fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE, keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes.
B0000784XP|5.0|Anyone who says that the Lighthouse Family just keep making essentially the same song over and over again and that it's not even a good song, clearly need their heads examining! If only the so-called youth of today would stop listening to rappers such as 50 cent and listen to this there might be some hope for them.
B000A2H9CK|5.0|I've loved this album for years.  Wore my vinyl copies and all the singles and 12\\"s 'till the grooves turned white.  Not sure why this deluxe edition hasn't come stateside yet.  The DVD that's been released along side it is here.  Anyhow, the original LP is here in all its sonic glory, plus the wonderful B-sides and 12\\" mixes I hunted for months after the LP hit the top ten.  They always manage to sneak a few things in that I missed the first time around. The Working Hour (piano version) I'd never seen on anything as well as Broken Revisited.  One oddity I must point out to completists is that the Mother's Talk (US Remix) is the alternate version of that version, not the more popular single mix which features more sax solos within it.  I've seen this one pop up once before and I don't know why they keep including it since the other one is a much more 'finished' version of the remix.  Oh well, It's all there to peruse for posterity's sake now...<br /><br />Glad it's gotten this treatment at last...

B00005JOYA|3.0|This dark film leads to the question: What have you become?  All he could say was 'Hey, it's gonna be okay.\\"  Who are you to judge?  No one can judge \\"angels.\\"  We are judged according to our deeds.  Sounds like a religious movie.  On the contrary, that huge cathedral in Silent Hill, West Virginia, is used to burn sacrifices; a pagan symbol is atop the tower.    Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\" was used as a prelude to show how this pagan cult had taken over the ghost town.  It is symbolic of good verses evil.  Nurse Betty was there in her red sweater and red shoes (no, it's not 'The Wizard of Oz,' but symbolism and falsehoods where no one is as he appears is at the forefront in this creepy-crawly film).  It takes faith to restore innocence and purity.  Faith is the only truth.  Perhaps your faith will protect you, perhaps not?    What's your definition of justice?  You didn't tell me everything.  I double-dare the viewer to learn the truth.  Don't believe their lies -- what they had created mushroomed into an inferno.  Sharon had \\"seen\\" the town and school in her tortured dreams and drew colored pictures of them.  On one of her sleep walks, we see a huge lighted cross of fire at a waterfall.  Rose, her adopted mother, couldn't take any more and drove her Jeep to take the child to the scene of these weird dreams.  There, a coal fire burned underground and ashes float like snow.  She told her \\"It's going to be just you and me\\" but when she thought all was hopeless, she wept from desperation.  They found a devil's playground where the ghost women were \\"desperate housewives\\" right out of 'Pajama Game.'    Lonely and scared in this deserted place, they found a bus stop sign on which Neely Avenue took them to the orphanage and school.  Certain forms you just can't control, like the living dead.  This dream must end.  Everything (nothing) will be alright ever again.  Do you know what you've done.  They were fanatics and what they did was terrible, unethical.  She was emotionally tortured by the \\"human\\" vermin where they found a demon in the \\"core\\" of darkness.  This is crazy -- you who cast the first stone can take refuge in the church, where unbelievers are thrown into the lake of fire for their misdeeds.  A runaway elevator takes Rose into the bowels of fire, a hell on earth, beneath the church.  Deliver me from the evil demons who are deceivers and tell lies.  This can't go any farther.  All we ask for is satisfaction; only the innocents will survive.  The guilty will perish in \\"a ring of fire.\\"    Now, we must pray as they cast out evil with sacrifices, as in the pagan days in the Mayan mountains.  Guilt will not deny you.  I need to do this, Rose felt; she wants vengeance.  Your reward is the truth, but you'll never be the same.  Hurt, she yells, \\"Get off my back.\\"  They find things tarnished and are too damaged to see anything is alright, as nothing will ever be the same, even in paradise.  This scary episode is based on a video game.  End of Story.

B00005O5UJ|5.0|Up until \\"Aqualung,\\" Jethro Tull was known for their eclectic music that went from English-folk to blues and jazz-flavored rock. While some of that music occasionally bordered on harder rock, typically Jethro Tull's music was relatively light and mellow. \\"Aqualung\\" pushed Jethro Tull into hard rock in 1971.<br /><br />The album opens with the title track. The opening guitar riffs are immediately recognizable to anyone familiar with classic rock. As the song progresses, Ian Anderson uses reverberation on his vocals. The combination of guitars and drums with Ian's vocals placed this song solidly into some of the hardest rock being created at the time. The lyrics are about an old, homeless man with lecherous thoughts. The lyrics are very descriptive and poetic, intelligently written and executed. While the topic could have delved into a moral tale, the lyrics are descriptive rather than lamenting or accusatory or a social policy.<br /><br />\\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" follows, a story about a lady of the night (or day, apparently). As in \\"Aqualung,\\" to which this song refers, the guitar riffs drive to a rock beat, along with Ian Anderson's enthusiastic vocals. Again, the lyrics are descriptive rather than judgmental. In an era when many songs exhorted compassion and care, these lyrics observed and described.<br /><br />After the first two harder sounding songs comes \\"Cheap Day Return,\\" a return to the acoustic English folk sound typical of Tull's earlier albums. This short song is almost an interlude between the previous song and \\"Mother Goose.\\" \\"Mother Goose\\" is surrealistic and poetic, mixing references to fictional characters and plays on names. The song is largely acoustic and heavily folk influenced, Ian's flute lending a medieval sound to the music. At one point the vocals also harmonize in a folk-like fashion. Near the end of the song an electric guitar provides occasional accompaniment to provide a slightly harder edge to this folk-sounding piece.<br /><br />Continuing the mellower music is \\"Wond'ring Aloud,\\" with strings and acoustic instruments. The music is folk; the lyrics are mellow and an enjoyment of life. Before we think the album is going to stay in the folk vein for the rest of the album, \\"Up to Me\\" returns to the guitar-laden music of the opening songs. The guitar riffs are recognizable as being from the late 60s/early 70s, but the Ian Anderson lyrics continue to be obscure and poetic.<br /><br />The next five songs together make up \\"My God,\\" a concept within itself that questions religion and the hypocrisy of people that style themselves believers in God. Included are questions regarding buying salvation and the role of religion in war and life, and whether people in the church are as pure and holy as religion would have you believe. Given current events, these lyrics are as relevant today as they were in 1971.<br /><br />\\"My God\\" begins with guitar riffs that may remind you of Black Sabbath. The song is complex, however, and later the vocals are chants that may be intended to invoke an image of monastic chants to the listener. While the lyrics of \\"Aqualung\\" were observatory and descriptive, these lyrics are accusatory, demanding to know why religion isn't living up to its own ideals. The remaining songs of the original album, \\"Hymn 43,\\" \\"Slipstream,\\" \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and \\"Wind-Up,\\" all have a common theme based on religion, questioning the role and morality of organized religion.<br /><br />There are several versions of this album available.  This import from Japan is a remaster with six bonus tracks.  The cost of these various versions varies. The bonus tracks exist on some of the other versions, and their principal value is adding more bulk to the original vinyl album, which was a bit more than 43 minutes long. Be sure you see which version suits your needs the best before buying.<br /><br />This album has two faces, \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"My God.\\" \\"Aqualung\\" is relatively objective observation. \\"My God\\" questions religion. Much of the music is rock, often with a harder edge. The lyrics are inspired, occasionally obscure, often poetic, and always intelligent. If there was a category in rock called intellectual rock, this album would be in it. While this album is unlikely to appeal to many mainstream rock fans, the music and lyrics at the time were avant-garde, keeping in the tradition of Jethro Tull, and thus having substantial progressive rock elements. A must have for fans of cutting edge classic rock music.y God\\" questions religion. Much of the music is rock, often with a harder edge.

B000BB1MI2|3.0|Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect!
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This is a very beautiful score that complements a soundtrack where the two main characters are laconic men of the West who speak little, move slowly, and live intensely.  The women in their lives are powerful as well, but also do not always speak a lot. <br /> <br />The scenery is spectacular, and the music reflects it as well as the interplay of the characters as they interact in, within, and against it. <br /> <br />The interval music--\\"Riding Horses,\\" \\"Snow,\\" \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" and \\"Wings\\" are where Santaolalla excells.  These pieces perfectly encapsulate, permeate, and surround specific dramatic intervals in the film.  Although they are very brief, hearing them immediately brings back images and scenes that were also very skillfully captured visually.  Additionally, the music brings back the emotional reactions of the individual to the characters, the places, and the story as they were in the theatre, seeing and listening to the film. <br /> <br />Fans of country music will enjoy the honky tonk tunes and beautiful ballads.  Although eminently current musically, they are typical music of that time and place and also serve as backdrops and foils for the lives of the various characters as they unfold before us.  Although they were played in the background in the film, as stand alone pieces in the soundtrack their subconscious message becomes very clear.  A love ballad heard when one of the characters is dancing romantically with his wife or girlfriend really expresses what is or should be happening if the two men were actually together.  The songs of love lost are plaintive as only a country song can express.  Again, they are mainly meant for the two men who were never really able to be fully together. <br /> <br />This is a painful story of love that was never able to fully express itself and a society that would have and may have killed one or of both of the men if they had openly tried to live together as a couple.  The larger theme strikes a universal chordalthough this is a story of love thwarted between two men who themselves never really realized that what they felt for each other was truly the love of their lives.  <br /> <br />It is no surprise that this composer won the Oscar for Best Score with this soundtrack.  What is surprising is that Mr. Santaolalla, who is from Argentina, was able to zero in on the musical ethos and pathos of a story, characters, and time so far removed from his own personal experience.  However, as this score is the product of a musical genius, there is probably little room for actual surprise at what he has produced.
B000EQH2QK|3.0|Not a huge fan of Shakira's but I can never seem to turn the station when she pops on.  Maybe its the infectious sound of the auto-tune on her voice?  Catchy though.
B000007T2Z|4.0|Just too erratic and unfocused. It's like the young, little brother of \\"Lift Your Skinny Fists\\" -- there's so much talent and brilliance to be found, but within that overwhelming greatness is a sense of self-indulgence, pretentiousness, and an overall feeling of \\"what are we doing and, if we can ever find that out, can we even pull it off?\\".     Musically the album impresses endlessly, and Godspeed! rarely fails on that account. The problem lies within the album's sense of identity. While much of it is driving or beautiful, it seems much more superficial than their following effort, \\"Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada\\". The last half of \\"Providence\\" is perhaps the most acute example of this -- a roaring melody a la a 'much' subdued male chorus, rhythmic strings and backing guitar, militant drums... it all makes for a very stirring musical piece. But it doesn't have any real depth to it -- the overall ambience of the instrumentation might sound like it does, but the melody itself seems completely devoid of anything remotely trying to resemble what I think Godspeed! is going for here. I find it completely acceptable given it's the bands debut album, but it still just doesn't convey what it thinks it does.    Each of these tracks offers moments of great musical force by a band of stunning musicians but ultimately it is (for me) a look at the beginning of a band that would peak soon thereafter. Melodically speaking Godspeed! has never been challenged, and with this work we see the birth of that sensibility. For myself, however, what made Godspeed! a band that rose above most was when it went beyond mere aesthetics and into something far more powerful.     \\"Blaise Bailey Finegan III\\" this is not.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|This newest album by slipknot is a new sound an style from all the other albums and thats what makes it really cool. It has a lot more mellow sound to it but still packs a punch in certain spots. I wouldnt say it was better than the self titled album but its close behind.heres my ratings for all the songs.  <br /> <br />Prelude 3.0: 4/5 a cool opening song with weird effects and good lyrics. <br /> <br />The Blister Exists: 5/5 a great song, very cool triple drumming, thrashing guitar parts and powerfull lyrics <br /> <br />Three Nil: 5/5 One of my favorite songs on the album, cory's rap metal singing really shows through in this song and it sounds great, along with great drumming this is an awsome song. <br /> <br />Duality: 5/5 not one of the hardest songs on the cd but deffinatly one of the best, origionally released as a single this song starts off quiet showing how good cory's voice really is and then kicks in. it has a great corus and melodic lyrics. <br /> <br />Opium of the People: 5/5 i love how this song proves everyone that says mick and jim cant play guitar wrong. the whole song is like a big solo for them and it sounds cool, not a song that recieves much airtime but its great non the less. <br /> <br />Circle: 3/5 this is slipknots first acoustic song and it didnt turn out too well, the guitars sound nice but the whole way its put togather seems sloppy, if u want a good acoustic song read the review for Vermillion pt. 2 <br /> <br />Welcome: 3/5 another song that didnt really impress me. the beat keeps changing and it just seems hard to listen too, its not bad by any means but its just not one of the better songs. <br /> <br />Vermilion: 4/5 a pretty good song with softer, less distorted guitars, but its still not a quiet song, the lyrics talk about a girl and the corus is ok. <br /> <br />Pulse Of The Maggots: 5/5 a great tribute to all the slipknot fans, the beggining is kinda stupid but once the actual song gets going its loud and fast and sounds great. <br /> <br />Before I Forget: 15/5 my second favorite song of the album, it has a mesmerizing corus, great sounding guitars and awsome drumming, this is one of the songs that recieves alot of airtime so your likely to hear it on the radio, i would buy the cd just for this song. <br /> <br />Vermilion Pt.2: 5/5 the second(and best) acoustic song on this cd. the soft yet powerfull sounding lyrics pull you in, it has alot of the same qualities and beats as pt. 1 but its alot quieter and better done. <br /> <br />The Nameless: 25/5 my definate favorite song on this album, it has alot of different styles mixed into it but it still hammers out some great metal,in the song cory sings and one of the other bandmates kind of sings along with him, kind of like their arguing, its awsome. <br /> <br />The Virus of Life: 1/5 a very pointless song, just a bunch of random beats and clapping and stupid lyrics. no doubt the worst song on the album <br /> <br />Danger-Keep Away: 3/5 another pointless song to end the cd, this is a much more emo sounding song seeing as the thing they repeat over and over is \\"We too feel alone\\" its definatly better than the virus of life but thats not too hard to beat, its an ok song but not one you would ever put onto your ipod for a listen, theres just no point in listening too it because of its random/stupidness. <br /> <br />overall this was a great cd even with the two last songs being a total flop, i would suggest going out and buying the self titled album if you havent yet but for a second buy i would deffinatly suggest this one.

B000001EL7|5.0|Although there are a few flubs on Love Gun, it is truly the last great Kiss album.  Not entirely perfect, Love Gun is Kiss at the peak of their popularity.  The legendary live show that would spawn the awesome Alive II came from the Love Gun tour.  All bands peak, and Love Gun is the point where the monster that Kiss had become would begin to spring leaks and take on water afterwards.<br /><br />\\"I Stole Your Love\\" a Kiss classic and a live staple.  Simple, straight-up rock anthem.  Kiss created them.  Enough said.<br /><br />\\"Christine Sixteen\\" a song sang by an adult male about a hottie sixteen year old....hmmm.  Creepy?  Not then it wasn't.  Now would have been a different story.  The cheesy little piano riff is kinda silly but this is another Kiss classic.<br /><br />\\"I Got Love For Sale\\"  Love Gun starts off with three Gene Simmons' tunes in a row and that's kinda off-balancing.  This song sounds eerily reminiscent of so many other previous Kiss tunes (and future ones too).  Cool Ace riff and solo.  A rocker of a lesser degree.<br /><br />\\"Shock Me\\" Ace's first turn at the microphone.  His voice might have been an acquired taste.  This tune sounds a bit formulaic and stiff.  Ace sounds very uncomfortable singing here.  Still a great Kiss tune, cool riffs, and catchy hooks, there's an underlying tone here that you can't help but notice.<br /><br />\\"Tomorrow And Tonight\\" Basic rock and roll, that's what this tune is.  Maybe a little bland in the fact that it sounds familiar.  By Love Gun the Kiss sound was firmly laid down in concrete and that might have brought a few tunes down because they sounded too similar to other songs that Kiss had already come out with.<br /><br />\\"Love Gun\\" Trashy rock and roll.  Great.  Did Kiss invent the sexual innuendo?  No, but they created a whole genre of hard rock using them.  Love Gun is another word for . . . well...you know... and Kiss definitely had their share of women vying to become the holsters for their Love Guns.  Dig it.  This is where Motley Crue was born from.  Great, rocking tune.<br /><br />\\"Hooligan\\"  Peter Criss had hit the jackpot with \\"Beth\\"  then \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" and it was time for another payoff.  Unfortunately \\"Hooligan\\" wasn't it.  A cool little song with very cheesy lyrics, Kiss was pushing way too hard with this one.<br /><br />\\"Almost Human\\"  Great tune.  Gene Simmons had to have the dark, weird songs and this is one of them.  Where \\"God Of Thunbder\\" had come before, \\"Almost Human\\" followed.  Eerie and shifty, it was a strange, experimental sound for Kiss.<br /><br />\\"Plaster Caster\\"  In the early to mid seventies there was a particular groupie that went around making plaster casts of certain rock stars she had diddled.  Kiss was on her list and she took a little momento from each of the boys in makeup.  A Kiss staple and another sexual innuendo song.  Classic.<br /><br />\\"Then She Kissed Me\\"  Many felt that this retooled 50's tune was a miscue for Kiss, but I think it's better than \\"Hooligan\\" at least.  Nothing special, the boys in Kiss had to take a stab at a cover sooner or later.  Not entirely awful, just not that good, either.<br /><br />Overall, Love Gun is the end of an era.  Though their next studio album would be called Dynasty, this is where the Dynasty truly ended.  From here on out, things in the Kiss camp start to fall apart.<br /><br />Dig it!Guns.  Dig it.

B000001ELL|4.0|In 1979, Kiss released Dynasty, their first studio album since 1977's Love Gun.  Sure, in the two years since Love Gun, Kiss had pushed out four solo albums and Double Platnium, but Dynasty was the first collective album since Alive II.  Hailed by most critics as the beginning of the end for Kiss, Dynasty still had its share of gems as well as stinkers.<br /><br />\\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\"  Straight forward disco-enticed tune.  Very cool Paul Stanley song despite its lack of truly rock origins.  One of the better tunes on Dynasty.<br /><br />\\"2,000 Man\\"  A Rolling Stones cover sung by Ace.  Very cool song.  Became a Kiss classic.<br /><br />\\"Sure Know Something\\" Another very breezy disco-tainted song, and yet another very cool song.  Paul knew how to sing disco and make it work.<br /><br />\\"Dirty Livin'\\" Is this a Kiss album?  That's what people must have been asking.  This song sounds like something out of The Mod Squad or Starsky & Hutch.  Strange song.  Listenable.  Actually...still a cool song.  You find yourself trying to hate Dynasty for its musical inconsistencies, and yet you're strangely mesmerized by it.<br /><br />\\"Charisma\\" Gene Simmons in a formulaic rock song.  Sounds kinda strained.  Not one of the better tunes here.  Sounds like filler.<br /><br />\\"Magic Touch\\"  this song sounds way too familiar.  Actually, it sounds almost like Paul Stanley's entier solo album and that's not a good thing.  Kinda boring.<br /><br />\\"Hard Times\\"  Ace.  Straining.  Bad lyrics.  Still listenable but you feel bad for Ace for the shoddy writing.<br /><br />\\"X-Ray Eyes\\"  Gene doesn't sound like he tried too hard on this album.  Maybe he was burned out from doing Kiss Meets The Phantom Of The Park.  This song is middle of the road, typical bulls*it.  Bummer.<br /><br />\\"Save You Love\\" Ace tune that sounds eerily reminiscent of his solo album.  Also soundz a little like \\"Shock Me\\" in Discoland.  Not too bad.<br /><br />Overall, it sounds like Kiss is on autopilot here.  They were getting sick of each other's company by this time in their career.  Disco was dying but Kiss was starting to listen to people that they shouldn't have.  The purity of Kiss was fading away to be replaced by dollar signs and image retooling.  This was definitely a sign of things to come.<br /><br />Dig it!is on autopilot here.  They were getting sick of each other's company by this time in their career.

B000001EL3|5.0|In 1976, Kiss came out with two albums, Destroyer and Rock And Roll Over.  Destroyer took on a whole new direction for the formerly straight-ahead rockers.  Here Kiss found their biggest success by playing around the formula that had worked so well for them and heading into a more friendly, melodic direction.<br /><br />\\"Detroit Rock City\\" The greatest Kiss song of all time, hands down.  The strange intro and outro on the album detract a little from the song, although we get to hear Gene Simmons as a newscaster.<br /><br />\\"King Of The Night Time World\\"  Typical Paul Stanley tune aimed at the women of the world.  Rocking in every riff and verse.  This was the newer Kiss, the new Kiss sound.  Pop-catchy tunes. Not one of my personal favorites, but still a solid song.<br /><br />\\"God Of Thunder\\"  I love this song.  Gene Simmons was so f*cking cool when I was a kid.  He was scary.  He drooled blood.  He breathed fire.  Jesus, he was Satan incarnate, and that made him extremely cool!  This song is the personification of The Demon.  Awesome.<br /><br />\\"Great Expectations\\"  I don't understand why people love this song.  I think it's kinda stupid in its hedonistic sexually-retarded way.  Funny, actually.  Still, this was another stab at mainstream for Kiss. Kinda grand and popish.  Overblown when the choir kicks in.  This is definitely a step in the wrong direction.<br /><br />\\"Flaming Youth\\"  Straight-ahead rock tune.  A song that played to the teen of the world and spoke of rebellion.  The lyrics are a little cheesy and the riffs are a little light.  Not horrible, but not great either.  Could have been much better.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Pain\\" a cool tune with a redundant riff that goes on a little too long.  Very listenable.  The edge has been stripped off Ace's solos, however, and that detracts from the entire album.<br /><br />\\"Shout It Out Loud\\"  Rock Anthem!  Need I say more.  This song stems from the origins of \\"Nothin' To Lose.\\"  Kiss could come up with a tune with a hook and here it is.<br /><br />\\"Beth\\"  Peter Criss penned this tune for his wife and here it is. One of Kiss' biggest hits and an all-time classic.  Sweet and soothing, this song paved the way for Criss to sing at least one song on every album going forward until he left the band.<br /><br />\\"Do You Love Me\\"  a swanky, Paul Stanley classic.  Another ode to all of his women, this was where Paul came to life as The Lover.  Kiss created an image and Paul filled it.<br /><br />Overall, Kiss was moving away from their original rock sound to a more listener friendly sound,  Mainstream.  They would recieve huge popularity at this point and become household names.  This is the beginning of the end as the next two albums, followed up with Alive II, spell the last great chapter in Kisstory.  Everything after that is filled with stumbled and setbacks and mediocrity.  Enjoy a piece of the past where Kiss were kings.<br /><br />Dig it!h a tune with a hook and here it is.   <br /> <br />\\"Beth\\"  Peter Criss penned this tune for his wife and here it is.

B000EULJLU|5.0|First off, I dont know what Mr. Censored was smoking when he was looking at the art work because frankly its the coolest packaging of a cd I've ever seen. It alone is a good reason to buy the album in stores instead of downloading it offline. Now onto the music. Vicarious is a good start (only minor complaint is Maynard's vocals are almost indecipherable), a heavy hard hitting cut which is probably on rotation at your local rock station and serves as a great intro. This leads to Jambi another hard rocker and then we come down with the lovely melodic psych rock of Wings for Marie/10,00 Days. After these trippy twins the heavy metal of the Pot is a sudden but very pleasant change. To be brief the rest of the album is great but the outstanding cut is Rosetta Stoned. What a hilarious title but it only hints at the chemical fueled trip Maynard narrates. His lyrics coupled with their very freaky delivery make for one crazy ride just in itself not to mention the rest of the band is at the top of their game backing him. Anyways definitely better than Laterlaus but nothing will ever exceed Aenima.
B000001FDK|5.0|I think Grease is an absolute classic. There is really nothing like it. John Travolta was in his prime.

B000301YY8|5.0|Blunt is so good- deep, real.  Sings right to you.
B000E1155E|4.0|I may be listening to the wrong album, but the copy of Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not does not sound anything like The Stone Roses, What's The Story or Nevermind. Furtermore, anyone who says these guys are ripping off what The Jam did 25 or 30 years ago shouldn't even be allowed to post reviews because they're insane. The Jam's songs have purpose, the Monkey's songs are much more immature and uninspired. The biggest similarity between the two is that both bands use musical instruments.<br /><br />To me, the Arctic Monkeys sound like the Arctic Monkeys. The songs are catchy, big chords, strange lyrics, little riffs that stick in your head for a week; everything you'd expect from a British band.<br /><br />Fake Tales of San Francisco is awesome is my personal favorite.

B000F1IQNC|5.0|In this delightful tale we are whisked into the life of a widower and his 7 children who are anything but well-behaved.<br /><br />Sending many Nannies away screaming dad is at wits end until a new Nanny appears, her name; Nanny McPhee.<br /><br />You know immediately that is is no ordinary Nanny and soon realize she has powers that will bend even the meanest child into submission. But alas, she has no power over things of the heart and it is here that all must search within to right the wrongs and bring happiness to all. The storyline was good but did seem to bore the children that were watching it with  me from time to time, but when the story took off again it caught their attention and set them into a barrel of giggles.<br /><br />The characters are great, and the little baby of the bunch is a scream. However, to me the ending was truly the star of this show, there was not a sound in the room, even from the children,  as the last few minutes of this story played.  There was truly something magical and majestic about it and left you feeling good all over.If you want a true happy ending, this one is top-notch believe me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, it is well worth your time.

B000002UB3|5.0|To pick a favorite Beatles album is pretty much an impossible task.  Help!, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, Magical Mystery Tour, and The White Album are all incredible risk-taking albums that challenged a lot of what other pop groups were doing at the time.  When most bands change (Pet Sounds, comes to mind) their material gets initially ignored and then goes on become some of the best music ever made.  But what sets the Beatles apart from other \\"evolving\\" and \\"changing\\" bands was that they were able to satisfy themselves creatively as well as satisfy and blow fans' minds. I can go on all day about how great the Beatles are but I'm reviewing Abbey Road. <br />Even though Let it Be is the last album by the Beatles this is actually their final album since it was initially recorded after the Let It Be sessions.  There are your hit singles, \\"Something,\\" and \\"Come Together\\" but the whole album is great, with silly pop, \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer, Octopuss's Garden\\" heavy distorted rock, \\"I Want You(She's So Heavy)\\" but what really catched my attention is the 2nd half of the album.  The 2nd half flows together and needs to be listened to in full to get a lot of the music and transitions between songs.  \\"You Never Give me Your Money, Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight\\" and \\"The End\\" are all relatively short but when listened to together have a lot of meaning and feel to them.  Tensions and stress between the group were high, but the Beatles still managed to get some of the best material out of them and is still influential today.

0689853637|5.0|This is one of my favorite Robert Sabuda pop-up books, although I am admittedly a fan of all of them.  While this book is fairly monchromatic, the simple silver, glitter, and white papers highlight just how impressive the folds and cuts really are.  That mere paper can be engineered to leap off of the pages as deer, or swirl upward in a silvery river as fish, or open up as a cave to a den of foxes is truly amazing and it never fails to enchant me or my children.

0440241588|4.0|Grisham writes a pretty enjoyable thriller with The Broker.<br /><br />In a nutshell, a federal prisoner, Joel Backman, is granted a presidential pardon in the waning minutes of the presidency of one of the dumbest and easily led presidents ever.  But wait, this isn't because Backman's ex-wife did some major fundraising for the Man, it's part of a government plot to see which foreign intelligence service will kill him first and thereby reveal the players in a nefarious crime of international intrigue.  Its a crime the US Government hasn't been able to completely unlock and the one which landed Backman behind bars in the first place.<br /><br />Backman's deal with the CIA -- hide in a small town in Italy, learn Italian and assume a new identity.  Backman quickly figures out that the US Government may have a different agenda than implementing a surprise presidential pardon.  After learning enough Italian to order decent meals, he heads on the lam to find out what or who may have figured out he is really not an anonymous Italian every-man, but Joel Backman, wheeler dealer with more enemies than friends.<br /><br />There is of course a twist to the plot and adventures while Backman is on the run.  You get the idea.  Its a clever and original plot idea that doesn't quite live up to its potential, but still is enjoyable in parts.<br /><br />I rate this an average Grisham. A little too much time spent learning to conjugate Itlalian verbs in various cafes and restaurants (the green sock is on the red table.  Can I have a napkin with my espresso, please?) and too little adventure/background for my taste, but overall an enjoyable escape.
B00005JP4U|1.0|Al Gore wants you to feel guilty.<br /><br />And you *should* feel guilty, you really should, because, according to Gore's new movie \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\", you are killing the Planet. It's your fault!<br /><br />Oh, I should probably state the point of \\"Inconvenient Truth\\", which is:<br /><br />#1: The Earth is getting hotter---hot as Hell, really, hot as molten molasses, hot as Pompei at Zero Hour, hot as, well, something really hot---it's warming up every damned minute, even while we sit watching Gore warble on in this air-conditioned theater---the Earth is perspiring, boiling in its own sweaty magma, it's 95 degrees in the shade in Tuscaloosa and at least 10 degrees of that is because of you!<br /><br />Oh, and #2:  You also are killing the polar bears. Or maybe even making the damned things---gulp---hermaphroditic.<br /><br />The point of \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\", is to shuffle out the latest in environmental hysteria: Global Warming. In the last 20 years, Global Warming has really caught on, managing to edge out the previous Environmental Catastrophe that Time Magazine warned would \\"really freeze your shorts\\", the Coming Global Ice Age.<br /><br />In the last, oh, 100 years or so (but mostly since Bush took office), the Earth's climate has gotten hotter. How much hotter, you ask?<br /><br />Well, since you asked, about .6 C warmer, plus or minus .2 degrees C (what's a few points of C among friends)? This is catastrophic! And irrefutable!<br /><br />Gore shows you slides and graphs and powerpoints and stuff to prove it is so. Can we doubt him? Gore invented the Internet, so I think not.<br /><br />Did I mention Al Gore is in this movie? Al Gore, with a bunch of slides and graphs and tables and pie-charts. Excited yet? Wanna run out and see this flick yet? Yeah? Well you should, because very soon the ground itself might be so hot it will literally turn your car-wheels to tarry black pitch.<br /><br />This---the environmental destruction bit---is all because of you. Or not you, you're cool. But that jacka** that lives next door to you and drives the titanic block of lead on wheels called an SUV, with a \\"W-2004\\" bumpersticker. Him. Kill him, the Evil One!<br /><br />Ha! Ha! Just kidding on Numero 2. But really, Man is to blame. Or really, *The* Man. Big Business. Or to be true, Big Business that doesn't donate to Mr. Gore's campaign coffers. Or since most of Big Biz likes to hedge its bets---well, you.<br /><br />You don't really *need* to drive a car to work, do you? And what about that air conditioning? Couldn't you just flap your copy of the New Yorker up and down in front of your face, real fast-like?<br /><br />Trouble is, in putting forth its \\"Inconvenient Truth\\", the film manages to ignore---well, hang me, a bunch of inconvenient truths. Like:<br /><br />1) It's true that global temperatures have risen slightly in the last 100 years. It's also true that human behavior may have contributed slightly to that rise---but even there, the correlation between human behavior and rising global temperatures is not quantitatively strong or certain.<br /><br />2) There are other factors that affect the Earth's climate far more powerfully, and subtly, than smokestacks and car exhaust: the planet's shifting tectonic plates, which enhance or inhibit glaciation over the course of millennia.<br /><br />Indeed, just 10,000 years ago we emerged from the last major global Ice Age, and as recently as the 19th century we were suffering the effects of a Mini Ice Age that during the 14th century devastated Europe and Russia.<br /><br />The good news: we're now in an Interglaciation Cycle, a period of natural global warming. The bad news: that age is about ready to end---well, right about now.<br /><br />3) And finally there are the Milankovitch Cycles, the shifts over time in the Earth's eccentric orbit about the Sun, which in turns dictates the amount of solar radiation the Earth's surface receives, and consequently either warms or cools global temperatures.<br /><br />Think you'll hear anything about Milankovitch Cycles in \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\"? Think Al Gore does his own down-home rendition of The Funky Chicken in the film's final minutes?<br /><br />4) Even the movie poster hints at a really inconvenient truth: as Americans, we can get in a real dander about global warming, but in the end we're pretty much powerless to do anything about it on the policy side. In a sense, it' a cruel little reverse on the old \\"Think Globally, Act Locally\\" mantra that environmentalists are so keen on.<br /><br />Look at the smokestack on the poster, and then ask yourself this: how many working smokestacks do we have in America these days?<br /><br />Exactly: very damned few.<br /><br />That's because America doesn't *make* anything anymore: environmentalists like Gore drove all that 'old heavy industry', with its toxin-belching smokestacks, away to places like China and India long ago.<br /><br />Both countries are anything but environmentally sensitive, both are at the starting gate of their own automobile and industrial booms, both are rolling out billions of new toxin-belching smokestacks and signing up a billion new drivers! And best of all: both countries would be exempt from the Kyoto Protocol that Gore evangelizes for.<br /><br />5) Which drives home the folly of `saving the Earth', which is going to keep turnin' with or without us. In another 10,000 years, the Earth will be turned into a snowball in the next global wave of glaciation, swallowed up in a new and howlingly terrible Ice Age.<br /><br />And after that, a billion or so years down the line, the Sun will go out and things will all get very cold and quiet.<br /><br />That said, \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" does get something right: there IS a lot of hot air in this movie.<br /><br />Trouble is, most of it's coming out of its porky Cassandra, Al Gore, the flabby Boy-who-would-be-King.<br /><br />JSGceives, and consequently either warms or cools global temperatures.  <br /> <br />Think you'll hear anything about Milankovitch Cycles in \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\"?

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I'll start out the review with being blunt: This movie doesn't really have much of a plot. At the beginning it feels like a bunch of scenes of hilarity strung together ( Including Rex Kwon Do ) but once Napoleon meets Pedro and Uncle Rico comes, things begin to progress. <br /> <br />Small laughs and moments make this movie funny. You may not be falling out of you chair but you will have a smile on your face during this movie from Uncle Rico throwing a steak at Napoleon's head or Kip ( Napoleon's brother ) going \\"gangsta\\". This movie uses its free spirited design to bring the sometimes humilty and sometimes dullness of Napoleon's life to the viewer. <br /> <br />Overall- I guess I can see how some people would be turned away by this movie. Try watching it at home with your family and see if you enjoy  it better. You may find yourself laughing at the subtle hilarity of this movie and enjoying all the great qualities of it.
0780624890|5.0|This film is great from start to finish, and has some severely superb DVD   extras. I first saw it on VHS, and even in that format, BLADE  was a great show.  Its clear after seeing, the film, and listening to the features, and the commentary that the film benefits extensively  from audience  test screenings. I won't say much, but the fine details of the story, were made so fine because of the test screenings.  As good as Wesley Snipes is, its clear from his comments that he benefits greatly  from some of the best Stunt men in the business. Not to say that Snipes is not a Good  Martial Arts practitioner, simply that the finer points of the action we see are very well executed by people who are part of the movie magic process. This does not detract  from the film, but explains how the stunt men provide some finesse from years of work, and Snipes ends up being the face of the quality, but I guess that the way it works out.  The DVD audio is truly great in 5.1 and probably  better in DTS. The commentary is overly detailed, and has some powerhouse editing by who-ever put the comments  together. It also illustrates the creative input of Snipes as the film came together. As the cliche states, the film process is a group effort, and wow  what a fine product.  The wow  value of the film is even  more powerful when looking at the behind scenes work, that show that ideas present, but deleted in the first film, become manifest in the later two.  I sure hope this  does not become a TV series. The overall Blade feel is more a movie style, and the work of the cast is part of the magic. The picks of the people in this film, such as Kris Kristofferson are just perfect, and work well in this film, and in the others.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|By virtue of Christian Bale's devotion to his craft, he deserves five stars. However, the film itself is not quite as deserving and it's a shame. <br /> <br />There is no doubt that Christian Bale completely transformed himself for this film. The well-built but lean actor reportedly lost 63 pounds for this film, quite literally starving himself for his craft! We've certainly heard about DeNiro's famous weight gain to play LaMotta and many others' weight gains to play parts, but NEVER before has any actor transformed himself so drastically as Bale did for this part. There is little doubt in my mind that Bale has quite probably damaged his kidneys and liver by such drastic weight loss. Not to mention the muscle loss and constant pain he must have been enduring at the time. <br /> <br />Watching Bale as Reznick on screen in this film is very painful. Two characters refer to him, \\"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.\\" Photos I've seen of Holocost survivors are the only ones that can compare to his physical transformation. <br /> <br />All that praise aside, the film itself doesn't quite live up to the devotion that Bale provided. Could it be that shock at his appearance distracts from really becoming involved in the film? Possibly yes. However, the build up in the film is somewhat satisfactory if not too much on the \\"we want to confuse you\\" side. Ultimately, the outcome of the film is believable, but more than just a bit of a let down.  <br /> <br />Bale is a machinist in a factory (making what we don't know). He is horribly thin and apparently this is due to his lack of eating and his not having slept in a year. Why? We don't know and he seems not to know either. Something is amiss and he can't figure it out. He tries to keep himself together by visiting his prostitute girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and half hearted dating of a waitress from the airport, but he doesn't succeed. <br /> <br />As the audience only knows just a bit more than he, we want him to realize for himself that if he would only sleep, he would surely begin to be able to connect the dots and start finding answers to his questions. However, Reznick doesn't do this. Why? <br /> <br />In the end, we realize why. It's a solution that is satisfying, because it is believable, but it's also too little too late. I don't want to give away the film because it is good and warrants a closer look.  <br /> <br />I wanted to praise the film itself more than I have, but it ultimately is the lead for whom I can praise more than the film itself.
B00000ILGB|5.0|Originally released in 1970, as this was AD II's second classic record out of their first eight (8) lp's. After you listen to 'Yeti', you'll fully understand as to why old school fans simply cannot get overly thrilled about any of the band's more recent material. This is about as good as it gets. Tracks here that remind us all just how outstanding krautrock can be are the fourteen-minute acidic opener \\"Soap Shop Rock / Burning Sister / Halluzination Guillotine\\", their more recognizable \\"Archangels Thunderbird\\", \\"The Return Of Ruebezahl\\", \\"Eye Shaking King\\" and the three-part title cut \\"Yeti (Improvisation)\\" which is an unforgettable mind-blower,to say the least. A true kraut classic. Highly recommended.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|system of a down returns with mind blowing songs that keep you wanting more. this cd is good, and its very heavy at times and slow at times. its a good mixture to have and system of a down continues to write good music and mature. cant wait to hear their future material. I saw them live in Atlanta, they played a heck of a show
B000F1IQN2|1.0|Spielberg at his worst. The film is factually inaccurate and also badly acted.<br /><br />It's a piece of propaganda (for revenge) in the making of the old Agit Prop theatre the communist so loved, but on par with Pearl Harbour which I rate as one of the lowpoints in historical films.<br /><br />I have seen a much better and also factually accurate docudrama on the BBC, and - it also did not have to take sides.
B000069HK2|5.0|This cd was much better than their second release. This has to be one of my top ten all time favorite cds. every song on the album is awesome and something that you want to sing to for days even after youve heard them. the best song on the cd is Pieces Mended, that song will rock your world. I would love to break every song down for yall and tell you how good each one is but that takes so much time. take it from me and go buy this cd right now, its very very good, and you will remember it forever.
B00004TCPJ|2.0|Horowitz, like anyone with a great musical mind, was a keen observer of performance trends. Though he had long periods where he withdrew from the concert stage, he always kept listening to music. He was a record collector and listened frequently to other pianists performances. He must have become somewhat disheartened at the many recordings that were produced throughout the sixties and seventies. With the ability to edit and re-edit, most performances became plain vanilla offerings, devoid of any original spark or personality. Sadly, in my opinion this trend continues to the present day. <br /> <br />Horowitz was always able to infuse anything he played with his larger than life personality. However, I feel that during the late seventies and early eighties he was consumed with the idea that he was \\"the last romantic\\". In earlier performances, he always infused his interpretations with interesting nuances and twists of a phrase. However, when this particular recording was produced these nuances and twists became all important. His playing became so distorted and exagerated that the music doesn't speak for itself any longer. This performance is a giant ego trip for the pianist as Ormandy tries his best to stay out of the way. I agree with many of the other reviewers here; the Horowitz/Reiner performance of the 50's is a far, far better performance and in fact sounds the most mature of any of his Rach. 3's. I also love the youthful exuberance of the Horowitz/Coates recording.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|this cd was much better than their last two and I felt like I was giving up on Korn. Jonathon Davis surprised the hell out of me when they released this new decent album. Come on people, do not hatefully bash this new release because it is very well written and on a much more positive side of life. The lyrics are much more fun and you can relate to korn better than the old I want to die and cut my wrist lyrics of the past. I really enjoyed this cd top to bottom. Korn is not dead and this cd is a great catchy cd that will grab your attention. Kudos to korn, looking forward to the future. but honestly, this cd is not bad, just give it a chance
B00009ATIX|3.0|I applaud George Clooney for his attempt to make an intelligent Science Fiction movie, I approve of his selection of material, though the Tarkovsky original carries its own baggage and equalling or improving on it was always going to be difficult. Knowing that the late Stanislaw Lem didn't much like it should have given some scope for getting closer to the heart of the book. But it's an opportunity they elected not to take, deciding to add bits that would presumably make it more accessible to a modern cinema audience. Rewriting a modern Sci Fi classic to this extent is pretty near unforgivable. The plot thread about Cris and Reas' courtship is entirely spurious and the happy ending pure Hollywood schmaltz with a tad of pseudo religious waffle. <br />It's interesting, but somehow the compromises that Hollywood deemed necessary to make the film more appealing have done it no favours and it misses the target by some margin.
0792846443|4.0|This film is overall great from begging to end. It's one of the best adapted books to screen movies. It's one of the best suspense movies out there and has one of the best villians ever. Kathy Bates is great and she deserved her oscer and all the other actors do a great job. The story is very suspensfull and will have you on the edge of your seat. Overall it's a must see on a cold winters night.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Everything All the Time by Seattle's Band of Horses is not an overly complex record but its simplicity adds to its charm.  A little bit rock, a little bit emo, and a little bit country, it wears its influences on its sleeve.  Almost like a fine wine, you can distinguish the key ingredients as you swish it around in your mouth and after giving this album a listen or two, you can taste the influence of My Morning Jacket, Built to Spill, Neil Young, labelmates The Shins, and maybe even a dash of Wayne Coyne from the Flaming Lips.  Not bad ingredients to draw from. <br /> <br />Most bands aren't necessarily be trying to re-invent the wheel and BOH are no different.  The songs on this album however, are so strong and singer, Ben Bridwell offers the perfect delivery.  While the tonal qualities of his voice may present a familiar recollection, the annunciations are very unique often times reminding me just how much a voice can contribute greatly to the instrumentation of an arrangement. <br /> <br />Musically you can expect dynamic, lush arrangements with layered, swirling guitars, catchy melodies and a vocal track in which producer Phil Eck has crafted an atmospheric feel that could use a hair less reverb. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the album is incredibly solid from head to tale and is absolutely one of my favorite releases of 2006.  Pay special attention to the songs, \\"The Funeral\\", \\"The Great Salt Lake\\", and the subtle \\"Part One\\" which almost gets lost between the two aformentioned. <br /> <br />Also, don't miss them live if you get the chance!  Enjoy. <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I think all the 5 star reviews that piled up here pretty much summed up the movie. In fact, people here summed up the movie so successfully, propoganda activists have no choice but to try and write negative comments to put down the stream of positive feedbacks (which, by the way, is not working since those reviews don't deal in how the movie shows the complexity of human beings, just personal bias.) If you are intelligent, and won't be swayed by propaganda, then this movie is for you.
B000002J03|5.0|In my last review, I recently stated that \\"IV\\" was the best rock album around.  This comes in at second because it was as great as \\"IV\\", but a lot of the songs on it are still without a doubt worth listening to.  \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Living Loving Maid\\" are two of my favorite songs ever.  The still have enough rock power to drive me out of chair and start headbanging, but as soon \\"Ramble On\\" starts to play, I begin to catch my breath and take the time to listen to the lyrics as they calm me down.  As much as I like Led Zeppelin, I do have one question: are they going to make another album?  They haven't made one since 1982.  But then again, should they?  I don't know.  I'm just curious.  But I'm happy with what I got.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I'm no fanboy, but I have always liked TRHCP since catholic school girls rule and true men don't kill coyotes came out....just wanted that clear....bought a couple cd's thru the 80's and 90's.  I thought Californication was a nice return to form....and By the Way was not so much a let down for me as it was for others.... <br /> <br />This cd set, however, is simply, in a word, otherworldly.  And I mean that.  I have had it on rotation in the car since it came out and find some new nuance daily....a part of a song that hooks me differently....a bit of guitar, bass or drum-play that shows attention to detail and the fine art of craft.  It is a \\"stranded on a island cd\\".  I think in 20 years people will look back and think of this cd in the vein as Physical Graffiti and The Wall, as definitive moments in each band's career as well as magnificent, diverse and eclectic collections in and of themselves. <br /> <br />I do not want to downplay the complete package here....bass, drums and vocals by the boys are top-notch, as usual.  But....and this is a big but....John Frusciante has become something of a virtuoso in my opinion.  If you know anything about him outside of TRHCP then you know he is as prolific and gifted a guitarist as has ever been born, among his other noteworthy qualities.  But this cd set is really highlighting him specifically in a way that just begs to be called out and pointed out in a review as the genius it is.  I am just guessing...but I think I am close to the mark when I say that the reason this is a 2 cd set is becauce of his prolific and gifted guitar work.  Anthony and the boys know what they have together....as a group they excel in a way only the very best bands in the world ever have.....thanks partly to the exteme individual talent they each possess. <br /> <br />go buy this cd now.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin's \\"IV\\" has got to be one of the best, if not THE best, rock album ever.  The reason being is that it packs so much energy from beginning to end.  \\"Rock n Roll\\" is such a good song because it has a grat vibe to it.  The best song of all, though, has got to be \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".  After all these years (First heard in 1971), it hasn't lost it's touch.  Even though it is just a hair over eight minutes long, I could listen to it all day and never get bored.  Rock on FOREVER LED!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Snow White heralded the start of Disney's first phase of classic feature animations. Cinderella kicked off the second phase. Ariel here started the most recent stretch of 'Disney Classics'.  <br />The phrase 'Disney Classics' is bandied around too much and basically describes any of Disney's theatrically released animated movies (Disney's 'Classic' The Black Cauldron anyone?). This film however deserves the Classic label and, along with The Lion King, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, is one of the run of 'Classics' of the 1990s. Although this run was broken with Pocahontas (ignoring Rescuers Down Under) and has only recovered fitfully over the intervening years (the last 'Classic' was probably in reality Lilo and Stitch), The Little Mermaid deserves real credit for bringing the Disney Studios standards back up so high in such a short space of time. It's amazing to think that the ho-hum Oliver & Co was released the year before. <br />The success of the film probably has it's roots in the employment of Ashman and Menken as lyrist and composer. As well as writing the songs, they became heavily involved in the story and so Little Mermaid plays more like a Broadway musical than a traditional 'cartoon'. This would be even more evident in Beauty and the Beast (later to become a stage show) and Menken's death during Aladdin's genesis is, I believe, still being felt by the studio. <br />So with a great score and story, Little Mermaid holds all of the trump cards by also having a great script (socially relevant), well-rounded characters (even down to the support players), perfect voice casting (stand up Sam Wright!) and almost perfect animation (some small sections have obviously been rushed but not so they would spoil the film). The film was so successful that it also started the now obligatory Disney spin-off cycle, with a TV show, record albums and a slew of merchandising. <br />Extras on this disc are not yet confirmed but, since Disney has always lead the way in DVD technology, will no doubt include a comprehensive 'making of', deleted songs/scenes, interviews etc. Disney's balance of 'for the fans' and 'for the kids' is perfect and I doubt whether many 'fans' can resist the excellent games that always accompany a new Disney DVD release. <br />So buy this and marvel at the start of Disney's third-coming while we wait for the fourth.
1881273156|5.0|I recently purchased the audio version of this book for a long road trip on a recommendation by a friend. I was disappointed when I found out how short it was--only 5 hours! But after I started listening to it, I realized how much I would learn in those 5 short hours. After I finished the first CD, I recognized that I had found a treasure. Here was an author that could simplify a very complicated and confusing subject--love and marriage--and put it into easily understood and remembered terms. <br />The anecdotes are helpful, the writing style very accessible, and the concepts are simple yet profound. This book is a great resource for any person interested in marriage, whether they are married or not. It's sprinkled with a few Christian references, but written with a profound respect for all cultures and belief systems and shouldn't be offensive to any.  And it's short enough that I may even be able to get my own spouse to listen to it. It's a great investment.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold's CD \\"City of Evil\\" is probably the best CD in the 21st century I have listened to. This busy band (8 albums in 6 years) drives home the point that heavy metal is here to stay. The first albums of Avenged ... \\"Streets\\" and \\"Eternal Rest, Chapter 4\\" all sounded the same with heavy screaming and a lack of musical accompaniment ala Lamb of God from Richmond Va., would leave a true metal head with a bad taste in their mouth after being repeatedly screamed at. <br />  Avenged Sevenfold's \\"City of Evil\\" is a totally different experience.  With the throat problems lead vocalist M. Shadows had that reduced his screaming to a medium roar, left him with a Ratt sound vocally. The band came through with a crisp and clean CD that is hard driving both instrumentally as well as vocally.  The musical roller coaster ride Avenged takes the listener on throughout the entire album leaves one ready for an emotional break in the form of \\"Seize the Day\\", which happens to be in the middle of the album. This melodic ballad has a continual catchy beat while maintaining rocker integrity. <br />  The song receiving enormous radio time is \\"Bat Country\\" for a good reason.  The power provided by guitarist's Synister Gates and Zacky Vengeance leaves one wondering how two men could produce such a harmonious sound, with as many rhythm changes need to bring the song to the pinnacle of greatness. <br />  The lyrical review's I have listened too have been from the glorification of God's Holy Word, to the ending of the world, to everlasting relationships.  This is another reason the CD is so great, it evokes a different thought process from different genera listeners.  <br />  Music lovers of all ages need to listen to this unique band. No other band comparison can be made to Avenged either by bands of modern day or yester year.
0156711427|3.0|E.M. Forster is definitely an artist, but in A Passage to India his artistry falls short of the mark.  As in all of his novels, the themes of this book are both timely and yet eternally relevant; however, the composition of the story doesn't live up to the standard he set with Howard's End.  The echoes of Forster's philsophical standards are here, but there is a sense of cynicism and hopelessness that obscures the moral value of the book.  Whereas in A Room with A View Forster managed to stamp the entire novel with a certain ideology through a few well phrased and placed passages, A Passage to India is more of a \\"muddle\\".  And while that metaphoric fog adds to the picturesque effect of the story, it makes the thematic elements more obscure and less open to the reader.   <br /> <br />This book is good, as far as the story goes, but Forster could and did do much better.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Many \\"hardcore\\" Elliott Smith fans seem quick to judge and often pass this record off as \\"too over-produced\\", or the lyrics aren't as personal as past records. It couldn't be farther from the truth. <br /> <br />This record is the sound of an artist coming into his own, maturing, experimenting. It's still Elliott Smith through and through, there's no doubt about that. Some of the lyrics are a little more abstract- but they just require more patience and repeated listens to truly appreciate.  <br /> <br />Elliott Smith crafted some of his best works of art on this album. He really accomplished some beautifuly constructed songs. I first heard this album after Either/Or and Self-titled, and my first impression was that it sounded more plugged in, obviously. But upon really listening to the album, it opens up and becomes so much more. Songs like 'Junk Bond Trader' or 'Can't Make A Sound' become amazing pop masterpieces. There are also enough songs similar to Elliott's past minimalist approach, just more polished than before.  <br /> <br />Smith himself had stated that he didn't prefer big studios with high-tech recording equipment to stripped down efforts, or vice-versa... just that they were two different styles each unique to themselves, and that he enjoyed experimented with both. He really accomplishes that here and it's worth owning.

B000089CJI|5.0|So first things first...I hate techno music and I hate dance music.  But that's ok, because I still love the Postal Service!  I've always been a huge Death Cab fan and love Gibbarb's voice and lyrics.  Postal Service, though, have written smart, witty lyrics (something that Moby does not do!) and they are extemely catchy.  I found myself bobbing my head to the beats and singing along to every word.  My favorite tracks include The District Sleeps Alone Tonight, Such Great Heights, Nothing Better, Recycled Air, and We Will Become Silhouettes.  But all are great in different ways and Jen Wood and Jenny Lewis add flawless female voices to a few songs (especially \\"Nothing Better\\").  This is a must-have if you like Death Cab as it shows a little different side of Ben's personality.  Can't wait for the sophomore CD!
B0002KQNL8|1.0|after the scary and funny \\"return of the living dead\\" i couldn't wait to see this one,know what? turns out i could have waited to see it because this is the PITS!!!!!!!! how could they have blown this movie so bad!! not funny,not scary,and not worth the price!!!!!!!!! stay away!!!!!!!!
B00005JOVH|4.0|From the variety of all comic books adapted to the big screen, the X-Men are the greatest, at least when it comes to the social and moral topics discussed in their history. It's a comic about tolerance, rejection, prejudice, evolution, segregation, discrimination and the perennial search for acceptance.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer brilliantly accomplished to expose all the complex paradoxes, problems and personal issues the mutants were suffering because of the fear the \\"normal\\" human beings felt for them. Now, in Brett Ratner's hands, X-3 doesn't stop to examine so many moral dilemmas and jumps straight into action. His execution is more crude and superficial, but more exciting.<br /><br />Once again we find the mutants in the middle of a conflict: just when it seemed they were feeling accepted in the world, a millionaire discovers a vaccine capable of remove the X gene. Some mutants take the news with joy. Others, of course, aren't as pleased.<br /><br />On one side, Professor Xavier and his pupils try to discuss the subject in a civilized and rational way. On the other side, Magneto sees this discovery as a new threat to extinguish all mutants from the planet and convinced with this idea he decides to gather an army that will fight those who want to anihilate the mutants. A confrontation between the X Men and Magneto's army is unavoidable.<br /><br />X-3 is definitely more action-packed than its predecessors, but it also lacks the character development the first two movies carefully outlined to make us care about these people and their conflicts.<br /><br />But balancing with a sure hand the action sequences, Ratner has created a very entertaining ending to this trilogy, making risky decisions like killing main characters and overwhelming us with so many new mutants that we don't have enough time to get to know them as well as the old characters.<br /><br />A word of advice: stay until the very end of the credits. There's a small scene that will make you wonder if indeed this is the X Men last battle. I guess only time will decide that.uess only time will decide that.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Sumptuous, rich, lush and inviting. Like a gilt-edged dream, Joel Schumacher's \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is a triumphant love note to beauty, song and scenery.<br /><br />Adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical (and Gaston Leroux's novel), this movie ends up being beautiful in every scene, with solid acting and and a tragic antihero. The singing, the sumptuous sets, the acting -- all are the ingredients of a musical tour de force.<br /><br />In 1870, a Paris opera house is under new management -- just as diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver, a glorious diva-from-hell) is almost killed by a stage curtain, and stomps out. Fortunately Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), taught by a mystery tutor, can take over the soprano's role, and soon becomes famous for her singing. Even better, it catches the attention of her childhood sweetheart, Vicomte Raoul (Patrick Wilson).<br /><br />But Raoul doesn't realize that Christine was taught by a disfigured, tortured genius who hides under the opera house. And the Phantom of the Opera is not only determined that Christine should be the star, but also be his wife. And he's willing to kill for it. Can Raoul break the Phantom's hold over Christine, or will she embrace \\"the music of the night\\"?<br /><br />Watching this, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same guy who did \\"Phone Booth\\" and the awful \\"Batman and Robin.\\" Instead it looks as if the love child of Jean Cocteau and Peter Jackson decided to direct a musical, swathed in masks, roses, gilt angels, snow and velvet.<br /><br />And it all wraps around Webber's solid songs (\\"Turn your face away from the garish light of day/turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light/and listen to the music of the night!\\") from the stage musical. Most of the lines are sung, which surprisingly doesn't detract from their believability. And there's plenty of fun with the cameras, whether it's the dizzying views of the backstage, or a zoom through a stone floor to the Phantom's face.<br /><br />Schumacher also adds a few extra scenes, including a sword fight between Raoul and the Phantom, which makes the vicomte seem more passionate; and a flashback to the Phantom's horrific childhood. What's more, the story is framed by scenes from forty years later -- sepia-toned scenes in the dusty remains of the Opera.<br /><br />The three most prominent roles are what make or break this movie, and in this case, the casting is nearly ideal. Rossum has the ingenue looks -- and the powerful pipes -- to carry off the role of Christine, torn between her love and her passion. Similarly, Patrick Wilson gives some brains and strength to Raoul, and despite the romantic appeal of the Phantom, Raoul isn't hard to cheer for.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is a bit more difficult. Most of the time his singing is solid, and his acting is powerful and tragic as the \\"loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell, but secretly yearns for heaven.\\" The scene where he tries to seduce Christine is deeply sensual. But occasionally his performance gets really hammy, such as the unmasking, where he flings himself around screaming, \\"You little prying Pandora! You little demon!\\"<br /><br />Lush, exquisite and passionate, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a solid adaptation of Webber's musical, with good acting and excellent direction. A triumph for \\"the music of the night.\\"ing a sword fight between Raoul and the Phantom, which makes the vicomte seem more passionate; and a flashback to the Phantom's horrific childhood.

B0001I55OC|5.0|this is the worst book to screen job i have ever seen. the book is far better than this cliffnotes version of the novel about time travel by michael crichton(he must be mad)! not worth the time or trouble!
B00005B36H|5.0|Whatever your background or musical tastes may be, I can guarantee you that this album is a musical experience that you will not encounter anywhere else. Mindblowing is not even the word. I do not know of any band who has actually managed to combine math rock prog rock metal as well as mysterious but accurate spiritual visions of patterns all into one album. On the technical side, it is absolutely FLAWLESS. Aenima may have been very good because it was the Tool revelation but this is yet another level of musical depth, showing that TOOL are not just a metal band. There are infinite combination of layers and layers of complexity in the rhythms time signatures that I keep discovering on each new listen...a bit like looking at fractals. Believe it or not, it may be pretentious but the \\"pieces fit\\". Read the few reviews and make your guess. All I can say is that even in 2006, with great music, this still remains the best album I have ever heard in the 21st Century. It is seriously underrated and my guess in ten to twenty years time it will be rated as one of the top ten albums of all times... <br />
B000AMWIVM|5.0|that is the central question in this creepy and excessively violent thriller that works well as long as you don't stop and think about it to long! <br />    to men awake in a dirty bathroom chained to the walls,a dead body between them,with tapes telling them that one must kill the other to save his family. the man(a doctor) is given a bullet and the dead man has a gun in hand(he looks to have shot himself)! problem is neather man can reach him,but they have hacksaws,they won't cut the chain,but they will cut......well you get the idea! the rest of the movie unfolds as the men try to find out why they are there,and what's going on. <br />   this grim story is one that will pull you in and has a great twist at the end,just don't think about it to much! NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!!!!!!!!!!!

B00004Y6OA|5.0|this is another classic vh album which has great guitar playing and dave doing his mumbling,\\"have you seen juniors grades\\" he just makes this album fun to listen too. i heard that dave never had full lyrics for the song so he just decided to add some low talking more or less, anyway its just awesome to hear these guys on this album. the guitar on fools blew everyone away in 1980. craddle will rock is a killer tune, then they follow that up by everybody wants some, a great party tune, fools also kicks ass, romeo delight is one of my favorite vh tunes of all time, loss of control is a little different but is good as well, take your whiskey home is another one of my favorite vh tunes, could this be magic is cool and catchy, in a symle ryhme is good too. another one of the best van halen albums of all time. hope you enjoyed my review.

B000C65Z1G|3.0|At its simplest, The Constant Gardener can be classified as both a political thriller and a haunting romance. While both genres could have made for great films by themselves, their fusion here seems to result in nearly as many conflicts as it does accomplishments.  <br /> <br />The story concerns Justin, a British diplomat, whose life is shattered when his wife, a zealous activist, is found brutally murdered in Africa. While struggling for clues to her murder, Justin discovers she has been playing a critical role in uncovering the truth behind a pharmaceutical company drug testing on African residents. His journey will lead him to not only uncover a deadly conspiracy but secrets about his late wife that will take him to places he never could have imagined.  <br />  <br />This summary can't even begin to relay all the complex facets within Fernando Meirelles's skillfully directed piece. Stars Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz give heartfelt performances while instilling the film with its most commendable quality; a profoundly acted marital portrait. Fiennes (who always seems to elicit such smoldering chemistry with his romantic co- stars) is devastating as Justin- a once passive minded widower whose life takes on new meaning in the wake of his wife's death. Rachel Weisz is luminous as Tessa- the ill fated activist whose spirit haunts the film. Both actors understand their characters to the fullest extent- giving us clues as to why two people of such opposing personalities would spark such a passionate connection. Audiences will be privy to casual yet unsettlingly intimate moments between the impassioned couple.  <br /> <br />Hence, when the narrative flips back and fourth to the film's political conspiracy our emotions are jolted while we have to catch up with the increasingly complex plot lines. As Justin drives deeper into a world of political corruption where intrigued enough to care but perhaps the filmmakers could have transitioned the films subplots in a more coherent manner.  <br /> <br />Yet ultimately the films pros outdo its cons and the end result is, for the most part, a beautifully crafted film. The cinematography is nothing short of astonishing- as it is in most of Meirelles's films. The camera seems to pick up every layer of Africa's searing terrain with a raw intensity. Featuring a stellar cast and visionary director, The Constant Gardener emerges a film as beautiful and thought provoking as its final, poignant scene.  <br />
B000F1IQN2|2.0|No need to summarize the movie...you know what happens.  So, with that said:     I understand what message was trying to be conveyed, but the film just lacked something.  Bland acting (other than Eric Bana), gratuitous nudity (girl in the bar - it's what happens to her afterwards), unnecessary scenes of violence (you don't need to show the athletes being riddled with bullets to know what happens to them), way too long.  This could have been another notch in Spielberg's belt of outstanding movies, but alas, it isn't.      I do however, commend him for taking on a difficult subject matter, and for that, I give the film two stars.      BTW, I lived in Munich during the '72 Olympics.  I was only 11, but the memory of what happened that summer had a lasting and profound effect on how I view the world, or more specifically, on how I view humanity.  I would have hoped, 34 years later, my son would have a different view.
0679411585|4.0|I saw the movie first and was surprised when reading this book that there was another battle to take place and just as bloody as the first.  Hats off to General Moore and Joseph Galloway for writing such a fine story and for doing what they did in the Ia Drang.  I served in Nam, but later and up by Da Nang and the DMZ.  I found this book to be riveting and very hard to put down.  The reason I did not rate it as excellent is because the writing was not crisp.  But the action sure was.  General Moore you will always be  a hero to me and would have loved to serve under your command.  A terrific book!
073945529X|3.0|The author makes the following points: 1) sometimes you can make a correct decision very quickly; 2) sometimes a very quick decision is wrong. In his book he states that he has taken a whole year to write this slender volume. This book is the scientific equivalent of a trashy airport novel - it passes the time and then you forget it. It would be a very good buy if you don't read novels and are taking a trip - a short trip.
0553801503|2.0|I happen to have been an enormous fan of this series. At least until now. Martin produced significantly more material than the publisher wanted to pack into one book. Rather than rotate through his entire cast of characters in this book he has chosen to focus on just a few. So no John, no Bran, no Tyrion, no Dany and her dragons. Of the characters I like best we see only a few chapters devoted to Arya while of the characters I like the least we get page after page after (gloriously written yet insufferable) page. ARRRGH! Don't bother skipping ahead to get to the good stuff, it's simply not in this book. <br /> <br />Boo! <br /> <br />Hiss! <br /> <br />I can't wait to get the next installment, rip out the chapters, and interleave them as they should be.

B0000009S3|5.0|In 1969, Frank Zappa decided to put a temporary end to the Mothers of Invention, but of course new versions of the Mothers would surface until 1976, when he decided to put an end (for good) to the Mothers of Invention name. <br /> <br />Hot Rats, released in October, 1969 was the first Zappa solo effort after the breakup of the Mothers. Some of the Mothers of Invention went on to groups like Little Feat (Lowell George, Roy Estrada) and Geronimo Black (Bunk Gardner, Jimmy Carl Black), while some others went on to periodically appear on some of Zappa's solo efforts and even later versions of the Mothers (like Don Preston and Ian Underwood). For Hot Rats, he retained Ian Underwood from the original Mothers, as well as Don \\"Sugarcane\\" Harris for violin duty (Jean Luc Ponty also appears on this album). He also included Captain Beefheart for vocal duty on one cut, and some jazz musicians for drums and bass. Many of these musicians only play on selected cuts, unlike a Mothers album, where the whole band generally plays together. Zappa drives home the point that Hot Rats was not going to be another Mothers of Invention album. The album emphasizes extended instrumental jams, emphasized by his guitar playing. No socio-political satire here, vocals are confined to only one cut, \\"Willie the Pimp\\", courtesy of Captain Beefheart himself. This is perhaps the one Zappa album that listeners who are turned off by his humor will come to, because it sticks strictly to music. \\"Peaches en Regalia\\" is a prime example of that, a recognizable theme, and some jams to go with. \\"Willie the Pimp\\" features, as mentioned, the voice of Captain Beefheart, who is doing something far more accessible than anything on Trout Mask Replica. Don \\"Sugarcane\\" Harris gives us some nice violin work, and most of the rest of the piece consists of extended guitar solos from Zappa. \\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\\", as you guess, is a remake from \\"Mr. Green Genes\\" from Uncle Meat, except this time it's all instrumental. The themes are still recognizable, but extended solos are added on. The rest of the album is more of the same, emphasizing guitar solos, basically Zappa in a jam band mood, but of course much more solid and tight than anything the Grateful Dead would come up with, and of course Zappa sounds nothing like The Dead. A few might dismiss this album as a bit, should I say, on the noodling side, but for those not put off by that, I certainly highly recommend this to those who are not keen on his humor or enjoy the more instrumental side of his works.

TEAM AMERICA may be the name of the movie but Kim Jong-Il steals the show!!!!! This should be required viewing for the United Nations. It treats all politics with equal disdain.

B00007K02F|5.0|The cinematography and attention to period detail is breathtaking and natural.One finds oneself engrossed in the time period of this film.This version excellently conveys one of the central themes of the English novel of its time:a woman is relegated to her place in society based upon the circumstances of her birth.How does she escape her social bondage?Jane Eyre is a triumphant herione because of her strength of character.Thus,expect a \\"plain Jane\\" in her role,whose beauty lives in her spirit and courage,rather than her appearance.William Hurt's portrayal of the tortured protaganist was surprisingly outstanding.He is both charming and inaccessible;witty and complex;vulnerable and strong.And most important,convincingly appealing,at least to a middle aged woman!The supporting roles were outstanding,especially the housekeeper.The mystery of the house is both suspenseful and intriguing--it will definitley keep you engrossed.All elements worked together to a make this version outstanding.Ultimately,when reading a review I want to know if the film is worth purchasing.I have watched it repeatedly and am pleased I purchased this faithful adaptation and beautifully filmed version.
1594481938|3.0|<br />A Long Way Down started with great possibilities, but these remained largely unfulfilled.  There were funny parts, and touching parts, and thoughtful parts, but these were counterbalanced with some boring parts and depressing parts.  Don't be fooled by some reviews - the subject matter is suicide, and it can be a real downer.   <br /> <br />I stayed interested in the book until the end, yet I wanted to like it more than I did.  The characters were a mix.  While all were presented as flawed, and therefore more real, some protagonists were better drawn than others.  The least interesting was the American, and the most fleshed out character was Maureen.  Along with two others, these characters all meet on the top of a building on New Year's Eve to commit suicide, and through misunderstandings, really, stop each other from carrying out the individual plans.  This start is fascinating and fraught with possibilities.  As each character finds different paths to take, the book takes a big fall.   <br /> <br />Still, I am glad I read it, and recommend it with reservations.  Do not expect a High Fidelity or About a Boy, nor even the lesser book, How to Be Good.  This book is darker, and gives a feel that it was taylor written for the screen.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill.   <br />Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances.  Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly).  I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates. <br /> <br />Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses.  People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it.  For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale. <br />
B0000683DH|5.0|After the thoroughly unegaging original movie \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" succeeded at the box office, though it still blows my mind how it achieved so much money, people must have seen a different movie than me, I wasn't surprised that Paramount was keen for a sequel.  Even though I hated the first movie, I am thankful that it did well at the box office, because thanks to its success movie audiences were treated to the cinematic goodness that is \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\".  Fans of the original series were ecstatic to learn that the genetically engineered superhuman known as Khan, that last appeared in the original TV series during the episode \\"Space Seed\\", would be returning to cause trouble for Captain Kirk and company after his exile at the hands of Kirk.  Though the level of hype surrounding this sequel was incredibly high, one still had to wonder about a few things regarding the movie.  One, can \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\" truly capture the spirit of adventure that was found throughout the TV series, yet was lacking in the first movie.  Second, would the story of Khan's return be engaging enough to carry a feature film, and how could Khan return due to his exile on a deserted planet with the rest of his genetic superhumans.  And third, can Ricardo Montalban still carry the malice required to ensure that Khan is still one to be feared (this worry was due to Montalban's recurring role on the TV series \\"Fantasy Island).  So, did the movie achieve box office glory and lay all fears to rest, or did it fall victim to its own hype?  Read on through the movie synopsis to find out for sure. <br /> <br />15 years after being exiled on a deserted planet by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and the rest of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise, genetic superhuman Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is seeking a means to escape the planet so that he may exact his revenge on the despised Captain.  After a mishap lands members of the Federation on the planet Khan and his superhumans are inhabiting, Khan commandeers the starship and by controlling the minds of the crew makes contact with a Federation science vessel that is housing a machine known as the Genesis device, whose sole purpose is to rejuvenate dead planets making them viable for living beings again.  Khan knows that with this device at his command he can take over the universe, though the device creates life, if used upon a planet that already is thriving with life, it would effectively kill anything alive in order to start things over anew.  When word of Khan's attack on the science vessel reaches Starfleet, the powers that be, bring newly promoted Admiral Kirk back to action to face his old nemesis, but Kirk can't stop him alone, he'll need his entire crew back for this mission, along with his old ship that just so happens to be under the command of Kirk's former science officer the Vulcan known as Spock (Leonard Nimoy).  With the crew of the Enterprise reassembled and time quickly running out, Kirk and company head off to do battle with the most cunning and powerful enemy they have ever faced, and this time there will be dire consequences for the Enterprise and her crew. <br /> <br />So, in response to the question I posed prior to the movie synopsis, did the movie achieve box office glory and lay all the doubts and fears to rest?  The answer would have to be a resounding \\"YES!\\"  With the release of \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\" it was clear that the creative minds behind this franchise were clearly firing on all cylinders, and that the fiasco of \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" could be overcome.  This movie featured everything the first film should have had, from gripping drama involving all of the characters, special effects work that was astounding back in the day, but still holds up fairly well even now, an excellent villain with Khan, and plenty of humor, suspense, and action to please even the most jaded of fans.  Written perfectly by Harve Bennett, thismovie pleased fans of the genre on so many levels, and the ending was so crafty and shocking that it left you begging for more, as any good movie should. <br /> <br />As I said before, I absolutely hated \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\", and I know that many hard-core 'Trekkies' would love to string me up for that statement, but I offer this peace offering, as much as I hated the first film, I loved \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\" to the same degree.  If you were, or still are, a fan of 'Star Trek' whether it be the various TV series' or whatever, but was turned off to the series because of the first film, please do yourself the favor and watch the sequels, you won't be disappointed.. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\" is rated PG for violence and language.
031286504X|4.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" by Richard Matheson is indeed one of the greatest vampire novels ever written, and that's reason enough to get this book. Just note that the original novel was rather short and no longer seems to be in print as a stand-alone entity. So this edition offers the novel along with a collection of Matheson's short stories. Thus, this edition is docked one star because even though \\"I Am Legend\\" is tremendous, the collected short stories are middling at best. Out of the ten short tales, three are pretty enjoyable, as readable snippets of terror or suspense - \\"Witch War,\\" \\"Mad House,\\" and \\"Person to Person,\\" - and in these stories Matheson shows a mastery of psychological dread and creative plots and settings. Unfortunately, the other stories range from predictable to nonsensical, and may very well be leftovers and rejects. As for \\"I Am Legend,\\" all vampire lovers should be aware of this classic tale of the last man on Earth who is not a vampire, and Matheson's extremely creative treatments of this man's loneliness, and the efforts by the new majority of vampires to understand themselves and build their own society. This story is a masterpiece of human and inhuman dread, and you should certainly obtain this whole book just to get your hands on this classic. [~doomsdayer520~]

B00003CX8U|5.0|I'll keep this brief. Trying to think of a director living and working today who would make a film this brave is impossible. It's unfathomable. This is a film that stands among the very best of the last, great gasp of American film making in the late seventies. If you have an aversion towards \\"musicals\\", (which I do) leave your aversions aside and view one of the greatest autobigraphical films ever made. It's self depreciating nature is way beyond words. It's triumphant in it's self exploration, perhaps more so than any other film I've seen. What a movie. Do yourself a favor.
0783114222|5.0|I will try to keep this short and sweet. <br /> <br />I watch this series at least once a year to restore my faith in humanity. <br /> <br />This is the sort of stuff that makes grown men weep. It is unbelievably powerful and moving. <br /> <br />It is - without exception - my single favorite thing ever committed to film. <br /> <br />This series is why I bought a DVD player. <br /> <br />Enough said. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CX9E|5.0|I read the negative reviews about this movie - and while I'm tempted to be shocked, I'm not. <br /> <br />Do we really expect this generation to give rave reviews to a masterpiece like Citizen Kane when they write glowing reports for such classics as \\"Dude...where's my car?\\" and \\"The FICTION Code\\"? Aside from the sterling acting by Welles et al, the plot for this movie was striking and awe-inspiring. It encapsulates the consequences of a negatively-altered childhood, power-hungry ambitions, and an attempt to \\"control\\" those you love into loving you back. <br /> <br />The mystery of the investigation after Kane's death is enough to keep an attentive viewer's attention alone - but the devolution of Kane's charisma and the emergence of his frailties make this film one of the greatest ever. <br /> <br />To those who knock this movie, I simply say the following: Get an intellect. Lose the MTV/CNN/HBO shock-valued, reality-TV ignorance that tends to dull the brilliance out of a capable mind. Citizen Kane will change the way you look at life, love, and the consequences of life-altering actions on the decisions we make.
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|This album has 2 faces.  Most of the first face resides on the first half of the cd and contains good musicianship, interesting melodies, and semi-well devised lyrics.  The 2nd face primarily resides on the second half of the cd, droans on, and the lyrics sound familiar (that's because you already heard that phrase 50 times during this song). <br /> <br />You only live once, Juicebox, Heart in a Cage, Razorblade, and Vision of Division are good songs. <br /> <br />The rest, in my opinion, belong to the 2nd face.
B00005JP4U|5.0|Like many others, I have been impressed by Al Gore's passion for environmentalism since reading his thoughtful and meticulously researched 1993 book, \\"Earth in the Balance\\", just as he became our Vice President. Reinforced by his decision this morning not to seek again the U.S. presidency in 2008, Gore obviously has an unwavering commitment to an all-encompassing, foreboding cause even as the oil companies continue to malign the validity of his arguments.<br /><br />The accountability of fossil fuels has engendered such heated controversy that Gore constantly seems on the edge of becoming a political pariah in contrast to more media-attuned topics such as terrorism and the economy. Even so, I was not expecting to be so enthralled by what is essentially a slide show that he estimates he has given over one thousand times in sixteen years on the perils of global warming. I am happy to report that first-time feature director Davis Guggenheim has done a superb job in capturing Gore's veracity and personal dedication with vigor and candor.<br /><br />Guggenheim reveals not only a Gore with foibles and a level of humanism missing from his previous media appearances but also an eye-opening look at the climatic chaos that Gore believes is quite fixable. In certain ways, the documentary is like watching a filmed record of a one-man Broadway show after the mandatory out-of-town tryouts. The result is polished in the best sense with an even-keeled pacing and a clear-eyed presentation of findings that increase in scope and personal proximity. The off-the-chart graphics presented are startling, for instance, the ten warmest years on record have all occurred since 1990 with 2005 the warmest on record. South America experienced its first hurricane off the coast of Brazil this past year, and an unprecedented number of typhoons have recently hit Japan.<br /><br />Gore shows comparative photos of the world's glaciers dramatically receding over the years, and also how a substantial piece of the Antarctic ice shelf has suddenly collapsed. His meticulous tracking of Katrina is revealing for the preventative measures that were ignored by political naysayers. He provides evidence of Greenland on the brink of a significant meltdown that would raise the global water level by twenty feet and then goes on to show the consequences in topographic maps of southern Florida, the San Francisco Bay Area, Lower Manhattan, Beijing, Shanghai and the Ganges River delta, areas where hundreds of millions will be permanently displaced.<br /><br />For all the palpable visions of Armageddon, the most surprising finding is the difference in press coverage between the scientific community and the mass media around the subject.  Gore shares that there have been a total of 928 peer-reviewed papers supporting global warming according to a 2004 Science Magazine survey of all scientific studies of climate change. Meanwhile, a similar sample of stories from the mass media showed that a whopping 53 percent claim global warming is unproven, a belief hammered home by Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who is shown in the film stating emphatically that global warming is all a hoax. Inholfe could perhaps have greater credibility if the U.S. was not responsible for over thirty percent of the world's greenhouse gas pollution.<br /><br />Perhaps Guggenheim's most noteworthy accomplishment is not turning the film into a political commercial for Gore. With the possible exception of an extended sequence where Gore shares his devastation after his controversial defeat for the U.S. presidency in 2000, there is a refreshing lack of pandering, as the former Vice President shares personal recollections - his childhood on a tobacco farm, his sister's death from lung cancer, his son's near-fatal accident - that make his perspective all the more resonant. Although I wish there was greater prominence to proactive steps than the end credit crawl, the film at least identifies them in quick order for viewers to start diverting the trend. This is essential viewing for anyone who mistakenly believes global warming is a partisan issue.is essential viewing for anyone who mistakenly believes global warming is a partisan issue.
B00005JOVH|3.0|I just recently got back from seeing X-Men: The Last Stand, the film which brings to a close the X-Men film trilogy.<br /><br />I am sad to report that, while the film does bring to a close to many storylines within the trilogy, it does not do so terribly well. The previous film (X2 - X-Men United) did set the bar high, , but it did so not through the use of special effects, but instead by taking the time to build up the characters, making us involved in their struggles and losses on a personal level.<br /><br />X3, at a running time of 104 minutes, feels much shorter and compressed than X2 at 133 minutes. That missing 30 minutes makes all the difference. Characters die in this movie, while a few new ones are introduced...but its hard for us to be invested in things, either way, because any caring on the part of the characters seems to have been excised out of the story.<br /><br />What is our story, this time out? Without spoiling things, I can say that a pharmaceutical company has developed a \\"cure\\" for \\"mutancy\\". This causes consternation, to say the least, amongst the mutant population, which splits along the Xavier/Magneto lines, with Magneto wanting the so-called cure destroyed. Many of the X-Men (Xavier's crowd) are still mourning the loss of Jean Grey...and when Cyclops finds her again, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Seem like two independent storylines to you? Well, they are forced together, nearly midway through the film. One storyline is about the conformancy vs. not fitting in, and choice vs. force. The other is solely about power vs. responsibility. Well, if you're going to blend two different themes together, then you should take the time to do it right. Making a straight-out action flick, in which the characters barely have a moment to mourn the death of one of their two fallen comrades, is not the way to do it.<br /><br />So, colour me disappointed. It's not a bad movie...it's just not the best it could have been.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|For fans that liked \\"Californiacation\\" and \\"By The Way\\", you will love this double album.  This seems to be the RCHP progression and mastery of their style.  The Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic days are gone. These guys have matured and have become even better musicians.  Frusciante just kills on this album. Some favorites include Snow, Statdium Arcadium, Slow Cheetah, Wet Sand, Hey, Hard To Concentrate, 21st Century, She Looks To Me, So Much I, We Believe, and Turn It Again. I know that is almost every song but each one so good it is hard to leave anything out. This album is GREAT and worth all 5 stars.
0385336691|5.0|Jack Reacher is a hard-ass. He is bigger, badder, and meaner (when he has to be) than any other crime fic protagonist. I bet he could take Spenser (from Robert B. Parker) with one hand tied behind his back. He's the kind of guy you want on your side. It's amazing that he can be so effective while not having a home, a car, or even a change of clothes. How does he do it? I know I don't really care if everything is all realism in Jack Reacher novels because each one is a great read. THE HARD WAY ranks up there with some of his best...intriguing plot, red-herrings, sympathetic and unsympathetic characters, twists and turns...you name it, this page-turner has it.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|This movie was so stupid, I wouldn't watch it with ~your~ eyes.
B000002KO3|5.0|Perfect record.  3 long dance tracks and 5 short songs.  Amazing that this record went to number 19 on the Top 40 albums chart in November 1980 and remained on the chart a total of 9 weeks (considering the best selling record that year was Donna Summer's ON THE RADIO VOL I & II a great record in its own right, yet definitely a different market than the TALKING HEADS').  REMAIN IN LIGHT sold well.  Subsequent Heads albums fared even better, though similarly (per THE BILLBOARD TOP 40 ALBUMS by Joel Whitburn published 1987).  \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" was never a Top 40 hit (Whitburn's THE BILLBOARD TOP 40 HITS, also 1987) though undoubtedly an influential and well remembered video.  That song was my own, and many a listeners' entree to this record, but it quickly became my least favorite (after \\"The Overload\\").  Don't misunderstand me, though. I must point out again that this record is perfect.<br /><br />Producer, the great, Brian Eno's influence is apparent, though David Byrne has a lot of rhythm and soul for a nerdy white guy...Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth, with Byrne, had by 1980 become a remarkably innovative funk band, apparently at the crest of a New Wave, issuing a record that is never overwhelmed by production.  Eno's brilliance is recognizable with how much he had learned, for one thing, that less is more, with a definitely anti-studio production where any electronics are instruments in the music and not embellishment.  The result is often seemingly motionless music, now called ambient, with dramatic and transcendent effect (perhaps most apparent on \\"Houses In Motion\\" and \\"Seen And Not Seen\\").  Those transfixing African polyrhythm you read about enthrall on foot tapper \\"The Great Curve,\\" but the short song \\"Listening Wind\\" may be the most startling.  Remarkably beautiful, it is also hauntingly insightful and prophetic of today's age.<br /><br />The casual listener might take this record for less than it is, but anyone with ears in tune will be mesmerized by the grooves of this classic.he grooves of this classic.

0812976525|4.0|This book will make you want to smoke and puke at the same time. Devilishly funny as Nick Naylor lobbies for America's number two most preventable killer, the tobacco industry. Vermont Cheese being the number one killer. But suddenly Nick is kidknapped by supposed anti-smoking puritans and nearly put to death by being mummified in Nicotine patches. Something that can give the heaviest smoker a heart-attack. And the plot thickens when the FBI is accusing Nick of kidknapping himself to further the tobacco cause. This is a hilarious novel I am glad to have read as an ex-smoker. I give it four stars.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|The producer and director set out to recreate Jane Austin's world and her people, and they succeeded.  The loving detail of place, form, color, music, dance and acting in this glorious production brilliantly projects the viewer into the early 19th Century world of the landed gentry - a dreamland of beauty and wit. <br />The acting, (with the unfortunate exception of Allison Steadman as Mrs. Bennett who overacts shamelessly, and sounds like a rusty saw scraping on metal), is so superior to anything an American could see on television, that it is like entering a new plane of existence.  Best are Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, although the actors who played Ms. Lucas and Mr. Bingly were also terrific. <br />Great extra features, too, although I would have LOVED an interview with Colin Firth, who is to die for! <br />If you haven't seen it, you are a deprived person!
B00003CWPL|1.0|If the interesting parts were put together, you'd get an interesting 15 minute short film. Instead we get a dull 90 minute movie with hardly anything going on and hardly any dialogue. I do appreciate the film style known as \\"expressionism\\", but this movie only serves to shock with its display of the grotesque. The viewer will be horrified by the deformed baby getting sick or the lady in the radiator squishing things with her feet, but there's nothing else this movie offers. <br /> <br />The ERASERHEAD DVD also has David Lynch talking about the making of the movie so Lynch fans will definitely get a treat, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|After reading the recent reviews of this album, I had to put my two cents in:  Just because this album sounds similar to other albums Enya has produced, it's not a bad thing.  I have a wide range of music I listen to, and Enya is at the top, because she HASN'T changed the way she sings.  I agree that she has untapped potential yet, but let me remind everybody of what happened with Metallica.  They stayed basically the same for many years, and then produced two back-to-back albums that lost several fans because they changed their music style.  They never recovered, and are now looked at as a mediocre band.  As much as I could hope that Enya could expand her music, I'm still grateful that she hasn't.  You never know what you've got until it's gone....this album is beautiful.
B000255LIY|5.0|I've watched this many times and I just enjoy it more and more.  It certainly has differences, but Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart pull of an amazing performance.  If you are tired of computer-generated movies and a lot of speacil effects this is for you.  The acting is suberb and I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to see acting at its finest!
B00006EXL5|3.0|I just have to say it, people who are completely degrading this album are complete idiots.You have your opinion and that is perfectly fine, but my opinion is that this album certainly was good, but could have been better. <br />The two main songs that you really want to listen to, and should take the focus off of the others that have barely any rythem, are the first, called Romance, the third, called Vampires Will Never Hurt Ypu, and the last, called, Demolition Lovers. <br />Out of the whole CD, I would say that those are the best songs.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|This cd is as good as NsV or blasphemy, but it does kick all kinds of a**!! Good enough to get the five stars. Too bad worm didnt use the extremely deep vocals as vile, oh well, every song on here wont dissapoint. Buy it!!
1592401791|5.0|Geoff Emerick's \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" is an insightful chronicle of The Beatles' recording sessions at Abbey Road. As EMI engineer and co-producer, Emerick doesn't mince words in documenting the Fab Four's creative highs and lows. With the exception of George Martin, he understands the group dynamic better than anyone. Of course, not all of Emerick's work was Beatle-related - hence his enjoyable anecdotes on artists ranging from Judy Garland to Elvis Costello. A valuable book for historians of popular music.
0385336691|5.0|The critically acclaimed Lee Child has already firmly established his credentials as a maven in the creation of the action thriller.  His latest offering, \\"The Hard Way\\" featuring his magnetic protagonist Jack Reacher, only further enhances his reputation.  This gripping novel immediately captures your attention and leads you through a thoroughly engrossing plot.<br /><br />As is usual Reacher is minding his own business sipping an expresso at a sidewalk Greenwich Village cafe, when he inavertantly observes a man get into a car and drive away.  What he had actually seen was the pick up of a ransom.  The moralistic Reacher is a powerful, supremely confident and resourceful nomadic individual, figuratively a man's man.  He would be a valuable ally but rue the person that would be considered his enemy.<br /><br />Uncharacteristically, Reacher the next day visited the same cafe where a waiter pointed him out to an inquisitive man.  The man named Gregory was a former Special Forces soldier now employed by a wealthy ex-Delta Force colonel Edward Lane.  Lane was the head of a small army of blacklisted former Special Forces operatives now employed as mercenaries.  Being beckoned and chauffered to the Dakota apartments by Gregory, Reacher was informed that Lane's stunning wife Kate and her 8 year old daughter from a previous marriage, Jade, had been kidnapped.  Lane who had procured a small fortune as a result of his participation in a civil war in the African country of Burkina Faso, could well afford the exorbitant ransom demands.  Reacher also learned that Lane's first wife Anne had also been kidnapped but unfortunately killed during a bungled FBI investigation.<br /><br />Reacher soon made Lane aware of his finely honed investigative skills courtesy of a long stint as an Army M.P..  The merciless and psychotically regimented Lane offered Reacher a fee of one million dollars for the recovery of his wife and the identification of the kidnappers.<br /><br />Commencing his investigation, Reacher soon bumped into Patti Joseph the younger sister of Lane's first wife Anne.  She had been observing the comings and goings of Lane and his six man A team of covert operatives for a long while, setting up surveillance from her nearby apartment.  She introduced Reacher to Lauren Pauling, an attractive middle aged private investigator and former FBI agent.  The guilt riddled Pauling was the agent in charge of Anne Lane's abduction.  Together the women filled Reacher in on the details of Lane and his exploits.<br /><br />Reacher and Pauling would team up to investigate the latest kidnapping.  The unearthing of some surprising clues, stoked up feelings of hatred for his boss, Lane.  Reacher now had a cause to fight for, the well being of Kate Lane and her daughter Jade.<br /><br />The dogged Reacher would eventually solve the mystery, mete out his own righteous and draconian form of justice and then as always fade back into the woodwork.<br /><br />I eagerly await Childs' next Reacher adventure \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\".cing his investigation, Reacher soon bumped into Patti Joseph the younger sister of Lane's first wife Anne.

068987474X|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend.  It was a very quick read, and good entertainment.  Unfortunately, as women, it pretty much tells us what we don't want to hear, but already knew.  It has helped change my outlook, though.  Regardless of how \\"into\\" a guy I am, I no longer call or email immediately when I don't hear from him, and I think this has helped me appear much less needy.  It's true, if he does like you, he'll call.  If he doesn't call, move on!  The humor of this book, alone, makes it a worthwhile purchase.
B00025G2K0|4.0|I have not read a Forsyth book in years, but that may change.  This was an enjoyable book that definitely kept me engaged.  I enjoyed the background information--particularly the sections on the tunnel rats and on the war in central Europe.  I was familiar with the tunnels, but the descriptions of the tunnel warfare was almost too real for comfort.    Other reviewers have noted valid complaints with the overall plausiblity of some of the story's details.  I agree and also felt that at points Forsyth got a bit sloppy with facts (e.g. Eglin Air Force Base is not in Pensacola).  The editors could have done a bit better job at points too.    Overall, though, this was a very readable, well paced story that also contained some worthwhile information.  It was well worth my time, and I would gladly read some of his other works.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|This show is about the sexual and romantic escapades of four depraved New York women.  If one were to compile a list of those shows, movies, works of fiction, that best combined great entertainment with unsavory protagonists, the top spots would have to include \\"In Cold Blood\\" (murderers), \\"Lolita\\" (child molester), and \\"Sex and the City\\" (the basest, coarsest, most objectionable and trivial kind of American female).   One suspects, however, that only in this last case, is the audience somehow intended to like and admire the characters.    This characterization applies principally to Carrie, an awful, awful, whiny, self-absorbed, horse-faced, shoe-hungry madwoman (very well acted by SJP); the other three have some redeeming qualities:  Miranda is a smart, cynical, attractive woman and the transcendently shallow Charlotte is mostly harmless.  Curiously, the most lascivious of the four, Samantha (brilliantly acted by Kim Cattrall), is also the most likable and respectable.    One can question whether or not there really are many women like these ones (and, if so, how best to avoid them...), but there is a more interesting way in which the show rings false.  This is the portrayal of the male characters' attitudes towards such females:  they seem indifferent to such free and easy feminine behavior, whereas in truth most men are instinctively repelled by it (except of course in women they see solely as sexual objects).  The show has a number of fundamentally good male characters, most notably Mr. Big, Carrie's on-again-off-again boyfriend.  Big is a great guy, but his single unfathomable, unrealistic trait is his serious interest in such a horrid, grasping woman as Carrie.  One  repeatedly wants to shout at him \\"Run away!  Far far away!\\"; occasionally Big takes the advice, only to come back for more.    Carrie is, surprise, surprise, a newspaper sex columnist, and the show's favorite organizational principle is to have her, near the beginning, ruminate about sex for a bit, utter some banal rhetorical question like \\"Are we all repressed hermaphrodites in search of Platonic love?\\", and then illustrate its relevance to each woman's life over the course of the show.  I know that sounds trite and unwatchable, but in the details it can be immensely entertaining.  The writing is wonderfully crisp, often funny, occasionally clever, and never artistic.  Most importantly the viewer isn't bored.   Perhaps its greatest strength (like Seinfeld's) is a refreshing and unashamed commitment to triviality; occasionally it forgets this and assumes a false gravity that doesn't fit (e.g. death of a character's mother), but this is the exception, not the rule.  Overall it's very good stuff and highly recommended.  Does it mark the decline of western civilization?  I don't know, but if I have any daughters, I'm moving to freaking Saudi Arabia.
078322933X|4.0|Even though this film might be categorized as a guilty pleasure, it still contains excellent early performances by Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and a maturing Alyssa Milano. Production value is high, so this is definitely not a B-movie. The well-developed plot is a familiar one - good girl meets great guy who ends up being a psycho. But the lack of originality doesn't take away from the interesting progression of the movie. Directing, editing, writing and acting are still top notch. And, even though Wahlberg's character ends up going off the deep end, he portrays a believable 'normal' guy in the beginning, even providing an intense roller coaster service early in the movie. He made a pretty good psycho, as well. I enjoyed the film and would even watch it again.
B00001U0DP|5.0|If this story ended just after Guido married Dora it would still be one of the best movies I have seen. In its entirety it is  truly a masterpiece and in many ways. <br /> <br />First, Guido's  joking, humorous, positive attitude is a great example for all of us to follow.  We each create our own realities. We can't change a lot of things,so why not not be happy and make jokes about everything,like Guido does, even when life is at its darkest moments?  <br /> <br />Second, Begnini takes a very serious drama of one of the darkest periods in history and makes a comedy out of it. <br /> <br />Third,who would think that Dora, a gentile, would finally choose to marry the lowly Guido, when she is already the fiance of a wealthy (but boring) aristocrat.  The scene where he steals her away is wonderful. If you ever want to explain the use of Jewish  chutzpah, this scene is as good as it gets. <br /> <br />Finally,this is a romantic masterpiece. Guido's devotion to his wife and son is perhaps the most overpowering part of the movie. If only we could all treat our wives and children that way! Their happiness and security is all he lives for. He puts their lives ahead of his no matter what the consequences.  <br /> <br />The ending of the movie is so touching, you must be prepared to cry. Have several handerchiefs handy. <br /> <br />I was introduced to the movie by a friend, and almost by accident. How fortunate I was to know about this movie. It will always be very close to my heart.
B00004RFFI|4.0|Even though some segments of Twister are a bit unrealistic, that's ok. The action and special effects are spectacular and the acting and character development are great. From the very beginning, the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the very end. This isn't a documentary, so there are plenty of scenes presented for dramatic effect. That's ok by me. This is a fun, intense, emotional movie full of everything a disaster movie needs. Right up there with The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure, Twister will keep you in your seat, following every chase.
1557042160|5.0|This particular hardcover book is an abridged version of the books Little Women/Good Wives, (The movie is actually the two books filmed in one). The text is sort of a mixture between what happens in the actual books, and what happens in the movie, a happy medium.<br /><br />It is all in colour and has beautiful big colour picture stills from the movie. Some being of the four girls together and individually, Marmee, Lauries proposal, Jo and the Professor, Amy and Laurie. A good read for a younger person who doesnt want to go through the two books, but even better for a fan of the movie.<br /><br />FYI- If you are interested in one that doesnt have a dustjacket from Amazon, it's exactly the same underneath so you don't have a blank cover, still the big glossy picture and text.
B000058T5E|5.0|Quite simply: Mind-blowing. This guy has it all -- feel, edge, risk, dynamics, and damn big balls if this album is anything to go by! He's continued the theme of \\"Who Else?\\" with his experimentation of live-meets-electro backing, but this time the playing seems even more inspired. 'Earthquake' sets the bar pretty high from the outset, sounding a bit like a revved up Nine Inch Nails tune. Then we're into a stellar roll of four songs with 'Nadia' possibly hitting an all time Beck high -- fantastic beats and a touch on the geetar that sends shivers down the spine. 'Loose Cannon' has an almost elastic riff that sprawls and grooves whilst 'Left hook' wouldn't be out of place at an underground drum 'n' bass club in Brixton -- super-aggressive backing matched with super-aggressive chops. The album then rides out on a high, but toned down, note. A genius album by a genius man. Highly, highly recommended for musos and non-musos alike.
0763619779|5.0|This is one of the sweetest, simplest stories I've read to my son -- relevant to [...] age range -- explores real feelings that all of us experience, ranging from loneliness and being \\"left out of the crowd\\" to the happiness of finding a friend and feeling useful and liked. Such a nice, heartwarming tale.
B000B8QF14|5.0|There are no words to describe this live CD/DVD release.  Green Day is simply amazing and they put on remarkable live shows.  It's funny how some bands sound completely different live than they do on CD because of studio alterations, but Green Day sounds EXACTLY the same live as they do in recording.  Watching the DVD just always puts a smile on my face because they are so energetic and so passionate about their performances.  There has never been, nor will be, another band quite like Green Day.
B00005LMBK|5.0|i won't say there aren't a couple songs i don't fast-forward when i listen to this cd....but in general, this is one of the most extraordinary pop albums made so far this century. <br />the fact it was made 5 years ago truly amazes me. i'm totally unaware as to the cartoon-aspects of the band nor had i any idea who the legends were behind this work. that may or not be interesting to others but what is truly impressive here is the boldness by which this crew saunter through a mish-mash of styles and attitudes and almost always with deftness and purpose and cunning....and yes....some straight-up kicking joyous sounds. <br />there are no less than 5 classic hits here which deserve really tuning the stereo up...i mean way up. this is rock pop and hip-hop dub of a most extraordinary nature. <br />mcc>
6305537321|4.0|Although it was made before I was born, I actually enjoyed this film.  My only issue was the portrayal of the Japanese apartment manager which spoiled it for me, I agree with the Amazon editorial review on this subject.  Rooney is a great actor so its not an issue with him, more of a comment on the times perhaps.  I agree with most of the review of the past reviewer who wrote a bit about Japanese people, except to say, \\"Ainu-shmamu\\"!!<br /><br />It's a classic movie for its time, in many ways much more interesting dialog than in movies these days, timeless subject matter.  What can you say about Audrey Hepburn...  Interesting to see George Peppard in this role since my exposure to him has been limited to the \\"A-Team\\" and old war movies.
B00005JOYA|5.0|Ok, I don't get scared from these horror movies, I go to just see how interesting they are.  This movie did a VERY excellent job with its effects.  A lot of the the creatures were not special effects.  The feel does create a very spooky place to be searching.  I was so impressed to the point I have seriously considered writing a letter to thank the producers on creating such a well made horror film.  I felt a lot of people who did not get it tend to be the \\"Duh, are they going to fight now?\\" kind of people.  Simple put, this is NOT one of your action/comedy \\"horror\\" films.  I shall buy this on DVD the day it comes out.
0765315246|3.0|Old Man's War has a lot of interesting and innovative ideas that give it potential to be either a great stand-alone novel or the beginning of a series. The author, John Scalzi, has created a world that seems to be a cross between two famous science fiction authors. There is a lot of Robert Heinlein in the military Sci.-Fi. aspects. Then in the multitude of strange inter-stellar races that the Human Race contends with I see the influence of Allan Dean Foster. The premise of elderly people being recruited into the Colonial Armed Forces and getting the bodies of young adults and then let loose in the universe in defense of the Human Race is very interesting and fun to read. Scalzi even puts in a touching romantic element that fits in with the story. In sum, he has come up with a fantastic and original concept that I enjoyed.<br /><br />There is a big \\"HOWEVER\\" to this review.  I hate to rain on the parade of great reviews, but Scalzi does not follow up with a storyline worthy of the preceding. What we have is a \\"if this is Tuesday, it must be Planet X\\" series of unrelated incidents against often incompetent opponents. This falls way short of an epic struggle between inter-stellar civilizations. In the middle of the book, the myriad of planets and the weird intelligent life forms and customs becomes close to silly rather than intriguing.  Heinlein's Starship Troopers, in contrast, portrays a skillful, disturbing, and scary race that threatens the very existence of Mankind. There is no problem understanding why Earth has to fight Heinlein's war and what is at stake. To be fair, the ending of Old Man's War does have more substance and begins to improve on the missing elements. Old Man's War has a lot going for it and I will read more of Scalzi's books in the future. I just think it could have been a lot better and maybe even one for the ages.
B000E1YVZU|2.0|I must confess that I have never seen the original theatre. I hear many avid fans praise the filmed version as well as the original. My impression is simply this; \\"why so long?\\" And \\"why so annoying?\\" And most of all, why Chris Columbus? <br /> <br />Or how about this - Why it took so long to make a filmed version? They should have done it much earlier. Today the story of Bohemians in the East Village of New York City is no longer credible and attractive enough. NYC has changed a lot since the 1990s while the film seems unaware of that, resulting in the detached feeling. What was refreshing in 1996 is no longer so to most of us in 2005.  <br /> <br />Of course, stage musical is a different thing, where you are directly invited to the world you are watching, and the actors' pure energy with dynamic singing makes you forget the weakness of the setting and the plot. The key to the film adaptation is how to transfer the energy to the screen. John Cameron Mitchell knew it as in `Hedwig and the Angry Inch' which is a knock-out experience from the first to the end. <br /> <br />But Columbus, whose CV includes `Home Alone' and `Harry Potter,' doesn't seem to know it. Look at the number \\"La Vie Boheme\\" that is supposed to be a show-stopper. Sorry if you liked the piece, but to me the utterly offensive \\"anthem\\" is just rubbish. With the stereotyped images about artists, and worse, homosexuals, the scene is only useful in proving how the mainstream filmmakers look at the Bohemians and create these thin, clichéd characters on the screen. Do they really act like that on stage? Or is this scene really supposed to be done like that?  <br /> <br />Among this faux Bohemian world, however, some actors manage to be real. Anthony Rapp is amazing, probably the only actor in the cast, who embodies a spirit of the rebellious Bohemian artist in the film. Rosario Dawson is seductive while dancing, and Taye Diggs is impressive (as always) as one former roommate with a more level-headed perspective. However, the rest of the film is about some good musical songs, many mediocre rock numbers (for which the original creator of the musical Jonathen Larsen is not responsible, I think), and some not-so-great acting from the cast.  <br /> <br />The lengthy film remains mediocre from the beginning to the end, and that is the worst thing done to the material that is supposed to be unique and original, hymn to love and life.
B000BGH22W|3.0|This fell short of magical almost entirely. The whole thing is either dark or intense and when there is a soothing section it's sounds almost depressing. Plus the three lyrical songs suck. The guys they got to perform them have no talent. And, even for the wizarding world the lyrics are aweful. I recommend sampling some of this before you buy it.  I know I will for the next one. If this is what surrounds the new world of \\"Harry Potter\\" the next one is going to be Dark and Depressing most of the time. If you've read the books, then you know what I'm talking about.
B000FS9FC6|4.0|Whether you may like him or not, `V for Vendetta' is produced by Joel Silver, one of the strongest players in Hollywood, the one behind the successful `Matrix' trilogy, and the script of `V' is written by none other than Wachowski Brothers. First-time director James McTeigue worked as assistant director in three `Matrix's and one `Star Wars' and yes, the titular `V' is played by Hugo Weaving. This time, however, you never see his face hidden behind a mask - like Agent Smith wearing glasses. And fewer action scenes. <br /> <br />`V for Vendetta' is set in the totalitarian society of England in the near future, where one masked anti-hero shakes up the nation's political system which is controlled by one Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt). To do so, `V' employs a Guy Fawkes method - well, blow up the Old Bailey, you know - and he does it with accompanied music, before an accidental witness Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who becomes the suspect of the case, chased by the secret police. <br /> <br />[NATALIE PORTMAN as BALLERINA?] The far-fetched story contains as many elements as possible - actions, humors, imprisonment, and even romance - and there is always something right in front of you that is interesting to see, like the interior of `V''s room, his penchant for using theatrical manners, or believe me or not, one pinkish ballerina clothes Portman wears. The film certainly has several good action sequences, but what is fascinating may be the character of `V' himself, and the far-reaching effects that changes the life of other characters including Evey. <br /> <br />To me, however, two actors from UK are more impressive than `V' and Evey. They are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Stephen Fry as popular TV show host. They both represent the ordinary people who attempt to follow their conscience even under the fascist regime without using the terrorist tactics that `V' employs. And they know they are very weak, like Jonathan Pryce's hero in `Brazil.'  <br /> <br />Compared with them, the acting Portman looks sometimes weak, with the British accent that appears and disappears. The film's reference to one Dumas novel is too obvious, and even detracting. There is one big twist in the middle part of the film, which is not convincing, and most of all, John Hurt's `Sutler,' always yelling before the monitor, is not my idea of the fascist leader in the 21st century. And as to the film's explanation about the emergence of UK's dark totalitarian society, it is as credible as the big secret of the `Matrix.' <br /> <br />`V for Vendetta' is absolutely a `love-or-hate' film. Its unmistakable message is represented by the words of `V,' but some of you may find it shallow, and say no one in the truly totalitarian society can act like `V'. It is a curious mixture of the childish (anti-)heroism of musketeer and the sinister image of terrorist. The film tries to mix them, but is not always successful. Still the film's stylish actions and images with unexpected humor are undeniable.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is still the best score out of all the movies. Don't get me wrong each film has it's own tone and needs to vary, but this score hit the mark perfectly. Anyone who tries to tell you that it's unoriginal because of small 3 second sections that resemble what another master has done is just an idiot. My response is, \\"welcome to the world. Nothing is fully original anymore. You take what has worked in the past, adapt and perfect (in rare cases). That's what's made film scores work for years now. There isn't one music writer who hasn't taken from another, who either influenced them in the past or just had something great. If you don't like it, don't watch anymore movies. I can't tell you how many times I've heard the 'Aliens' soundtrack show up in either a film or trailer at random.\\" Anyway, the other films' soundtracks are good, but not like this. This was perfect like \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Jaws,\\" and \\"Indiana Jones.\\" There's just a certain magic to how it flows.
B00000JPH6|2.0|Ok, I guess I'm just weird. I'm a HUGE fantasy fan. I absolutely devour every bit of fantasy related material I can get my hands on...but this movie was disappointing to me.<br /><br />I turned it off about 20-30 minutes into it...I was just too bored to stay awake.<br /><br />While I appreciate the puppet-work and the eerie atmosphere, this move REALLY could have used more dynamic dialogue to pull the viewer into the story.<br /><br />I was able to sit through the entire 12hr extended dvd version of Lord of the Rings without getting bored, but this movie just seemed to drag and drag to me...I couldn't get into it!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon who played Johnny Cash and June Carter were superb.  I am amazed at how close Phoenix comes to the voice of Johnny Cash.  The story line is interesting and really not a dull moment in the movie.  This movie was as good as Ray or better.  I really wish there would have been more songs included by Johnny Cash instead of other artists.  The movie does not include Cash's entire life, but only up to his Fulsom Prison performance.  I do think that the movie represented Johnny well.  Of course I recommend that you see this movie.
B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden has been a band that I can listen to more than just one CD over and over and over and over again. Anything from \\"Iron Maiden\\" to \\"Seventh Son\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" and onward. \\"Somewhere In Time\\" is my personal favorite of them all!     \\"Somewhere In Time\\" marks a shift in Iron Maiden's music from \\"Powerslave\\" taking their signature metal style full of dual lead guitar, melodic riffs and vocals, and lead style bass play and pounding drums and adding some keyboard (or guitar-synths) to the melodies creating some sort of atmosphere that just fits the album cover perfectly! It sounds so...futuristic as far as production goes. Musically, it's no different from previous Maiden releases. Songs get a bit longer though, showcasing some progressive elements creeping in, I think that shows some maturing in songwriting but that's just my opinion. Real keyboards would be further included in the band's follow up \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\" which is stylistically the same as \\"Somewhere In Time\\" but not as futuristic, or atmospheric.    The album kicks off with what has been added - futuristic dual lead guitar-synths before kicking into full speed in what Iron Maiden has been known for in the song \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\" - what else...IT GALLOPS - another signature of Maiden. Bruce's chorus is a great example of why Bruce is the voice of Maiden with his high wails of \\"caaaaaaaaught sooooooomewwwwwwhhhhere in taaaayyyiiiayyyyiiaaayyyym!!!\\" \\"Wasted Years\\" has yet another futuristic lead guitar intro, a catchy chorus. \\"Sea Of Madness\\" and \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" have a very atmospheric intro before jumping into Full Maiden mode. Most of the songs follow that particular thing. All the songs have something to do with \\"time\\" and they have this digital, futuristic feel to them that just capture the concept perfectly! \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" just has me imagining an entire time travel especially in the lead guitar during the chorus.     I like the typicalIron Maiden formula a lot, but the inclusion of this specific production, atmosphere, spirit and the synths make the album very unique while still sounding somewhat classic.     If you're a hardcore Maiden fan, you probably already have this album. If you're starting, I'd like to say start with this album, but you might wanna be familiar with something like \\"Number of the Beast\\" or \\"Powerslave.\\"     Whatever, I love this album a lot, not only is it my favorite Maiden album, but it's also one of my favorite metal albums of all time!     UP THE IRONS!!!
B00025ETIW|4.0|MCR become more mainstream accessible and doesn't suck...amazing.    After listening to the song \\"Helena\\" about five months before MCR's big break, I really found that song to be one of the greatest songs ever--so I anticipated the day that my cousin would send the CD in the album, which was about 7 months later.  As soon as I recieved it in the mail, I ripped it out of the padded envelope and forced it into my CD player (I didn't have an iPod at the time).  I never expected this much from a pop-rock band!    1. Helena- the 2nd single off of this album, a worthy dance-punk song that has already marked MCR's style shift to more a mainstream-accessible sound.  Nonetheless, fun to sing and dance along to; the music wasn't too complex, it was in fact very messy and confusing, but the lyrics weren't too shabby.  A very catchy song: 9.5/10    2. Give 'Em Hell, Kid- a more furious and musically-focused song with a blazing guitar solo in the beginning and claustrophobic percussion; a fast and catchy song with a GNR edge. 9.5/10    3. To the End- this song was a bit annoying with the first time listening to it, and this is CRUCIAL to listen with both earbuds in.  The guitar is a bit eerie and a bit reminiscent of the Cure's work while the rest of the song resemble AFI's \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" and the Misfits toned down a bit.  8/10    4. You Know What they Do to Guys Like Us In Prison- this is once again, a more instrumentally focused song with various guitar solos here and there with a continuous/spastic guitar part that furiously rages throughout the song.  The lyrics are humorous--homophobe having sex with a homo, funny.  The vocals by Bert McCracken really aren't noticeable one bit, because I was afraid that he would screw up the song and make it sound like [...], but he wasn't noticed at all.  10/10    5. I'm Not Okay- the first single that helped MCR break out of the underground, this is probably the most under-16 accessible song that would be a likely KidZ Bop song (MUSICSPACE, DO NOT GET ANY IDEAS).  A stereotypical pop-punk song really, power chords with an unexpected solo in between to keep you from dying of boredom with the repeated chorus (the lyrics make fun of emo, for you anti-emo peeps out there); a catchy, yet   unoriginal song. 7/10    6. Ghost of You- this is probably the worst song on the CD and candidate to be the worst song MCR has ever written.  The song is emotionally-driven and mediocre with lyrics as its only strong point. 4/10    7. The Jetset Life is Going To Kill You- the end of GOY starts at the rate of a car slowly driving down a cemetery road.  One of the more downcast songs on the CD with a feeling of paranoia with the guitars buzzing the same chord one by one then breaking into an At The Drive-In-esque chorus with an even darker edge. 9/10    8. Interlude- there's nothing too special about this song, it's basically an update of \\"Romance\\" from their last CD with vocals.  It expresses the thoughts when you're near death I guess.  9/10    9. Thank YOu For The Venom- a great beginning, but it has the feeling of being toyed around with too much--there was too much time taken on this song that it made it mediocre to some degree.  7/10    10. Hang 'Em High- a chaotic beginning, with a draggy chorus that gets VERY ANNOYING after a while.  6/10    11. It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish- this is most likely the best song on the CD, with a jump in the beginning to get your heartbeat racing with a reassuring edge, like the hero's 'coming back from the dead' with pretty basic background music.  10/10    12. Cemetery Drive- I overlooked this song for awhile; it was bit too quiet for my tastes but after hearing all of the raving about it, I listened to it again and found it to be once again, one of the more thoughtful and mature songs on the album.  The drummer really proves himself in the song, showing that he isn't mindlessly slamming the drumsticks on the drums and the lyrics are emotionally driven of course; this is the most epic song on the CD. 9.5/10    13. I Never Told You What I Do For A Living- by now, you are probably thinking that the CD is 'over', but this proves that there is not a happy ending.  The chaos runs back in again and leaves you clueless in the end with the only idea that there will be a sequel.  7.5/10    Overall- 8/10    Pros: Catchier songs that are more 'sing along-able' and the album has a cinematic feel.    Cons: The drumlines seem meaningless 80% of the time with the same beatings over and over; the softness and loudness differences for each song fluctuates too much after track 8, betting boring and predictable.  Many of the songs sound the same as a result of this.  The lyrics were all right, but the concept of the album limited them a bit.    Overall, I'd reccommend this album to anybody who likes groups such as AFI (Sing the Sorrow), Thursday, the Bled, and others--not a masterpiece, but definitely a keeper.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|If you fell asleep in literature class when discussing symbolism, have the attention span of the average 18 year old, or have an IQ that would raise the average in two states if you moved, skip the movie.  It takes a little thought and a bit of understanding of symbolism.  Remember those movies in lit class, where everything meant something?  Donnie Darko is like that.  If you look once too often into your popcorn or tip the coke can more than an instant, you will miss a phrase, or a scene that will allow you to understand something later in the movie.  I read a lot of the 900+ reviews on this site and the low reviews (excepting those directed simply at the Director's Cut version) are due to the viewer being more than a little obtuse. They don't and won't ever \\"get it\\". The Peanut's comic strip would have too much symbolism for them to understand.  Better they spend the evening watching something they can understand, American Idol, Fear Factor or something loaded with a lot of T&A.  I am 50 years old and love the movie, both versions.  Each had something to give if you looked close enough. The Director's Cut tried to make it more accessible to the general audience by spoon feeding some of the concepts.  I think it is a great movie and could watch it once a week.  It has so many nuances.  No I am not a tree hugging former hippie burnout.  I am a conservative, a geoscientist with one teenager and another early 20's something rocker wannabe for kids.  I introduced them to the movie and they loved it too.  So much for the generation gap.  That only happens if your mind turns to tapioca.  Buy the movie.

0321344758|5.0|First off, let me preface this by admitting that I am not a web designer or information architect expert by any means. I work in tech being a \\"jack of all trades\\" with internet applications where we are always strapped for resources (ie we don't have designers or web producers for this side project, all those resources are devoted to the cash cow at our company). At some times I'm an acting site product manager other times I'm a product marketer. <br /> <br />Steve Krug distills \\"everything you need to know\\" into a short book that is written colloquially and deals with real-life web team scenarios, and gives some really simple exercises for reviewing a website.  <br /> <br />I especially appreciate his beginning most chapters with a real-life example (ie a designer vs a developer disagreeing about the use of a pulldown menu). This shows me he's been in the trenches before, and keeps me interested in what his solution is.  <br /> <br />His chapter on how to run usability tests on a shoestring budget will help not only me (who'll have to run the tests), but also will provide a lot of background on scenarios where usability efforts tend to not take off within a company. Additionally he provides solutions on how to mitigate these excuses -- he's about how to get things done, not about theorizing. <br /> <br />Thanks Steve - another new fan has joined the fold.
B0000931QR|4.0|La Oreja de Van Gogh treats us to too much of a good thing.  Fifteen cuts, including the hidden track, result in a certain sameness setting in for, say, songs 11-13 or so.  I may hold this view because, while my Spanish is good it's by no means native, and after awhile -- lulled by the very similar pop melodies -- I don't try to distinguish between the songs by listening closely to the lyrics.  The pop sound, however, is usually deceiving for the lyrics -- and their tales of loss and death banished by dreams -- are anything but lightweight.  Puedes Contar Conmigo, 20 de enero, Rosas, Geografia, and La esperanza debida are the best cuts.  But there isn't a bad song in the bunch; the group should have just saved a couple for another CD. <br />
B000BJS4SU|5.0|John Mayer had always bothered me. I disliked his image, his fanbase, and even some of his singles. But man can he play. He has always shown his skills of in concert (don't miss \\"Lenny/Man on the Side\\" from his previous live album), but his studio works have been up and down. TRY! is fabulous. Just listen to the guitar solo on 'Gravity' and enjoy. He's got two world-class musicians up there with him, but he completely steals the stage with some tenacious and beautiful stuff.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Havin Rolling Stone Magazine call your album the \\"Most Anticipated\\" is saying a lot. And believe me, the RHCP have fit the bill perfectly. The first time I heard Dani California, I'll admit I wasn't blown away. However, I came to realize that its a grower. Just like this album. It is a grower. Truly brilliant work by all, but mainly John Frusciante. Different sounds, different styles. I can't even name key tracks because they are all incredible.
B00097DX3U|2.0|The album strikes me as a little bland and boring. I'm no great fan of RATM, so the backing band doesn't really impress me to begin with, and for the record, their performance is nowhere near as good as their work with the belated RATM. I think this album is a telling indictment of Cornell's slipping ability, and his need to surround himself with equally capable musicians. Cornell is a phenomenal singer, but alas his best years are behind him (ie Temple of the Dog, Soundgarden). His voice is weaker and strained, and if that were not enough, Morello and company are not up to the task of supporting Cornell. The songwriting is flat as well, producing such bland pop radio ballads as \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" & \\"Be Yourself,\\" which are really pathetic when compared to powerful rock songs such as \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" from the Soundgarden years. I would suggest that all the younger kids getting into Audioslave, who missed out on some truly great music 10 years ago, need to look up Cornell's work with Soundgarden and the less exhilirating but still superior (to Audioslave's 2nd album) RATM.
B000005Z0G|4.0|you don't have to be a hardcore fan to like this album despite the fact its overlooked like his debut.theres alot to like about this album.<br /><br />like someone else mentioned holla if you hear me was pac's first single and video off of this album (alot of people didn't know this let alone know a video was made for it).but just like his first album the mainstream outlets shunned him.this was also the time when he was quickly becoming one of the most infamous rappers ever in the mainstream's public eye.he even surpased rappers like public enemy,NWA,2 live crew,AND ice-t when it camed to contraversy and moral panic.he was acused of influencing a kid to kill someone,and got backlash for his controversial criticism of the police force (wich i think is justified when talking about police Especialy L.A.P.D but thats neither here nore there :)) . amoung a whole boatload of other things.this album didn't get any real air play until i get around,and keep your head up got released to radio.<br /><br />while those seem rather light make no mistake the hardcore yet introspective thoughtfulness is still here.especialy in songs like streetz r death row,\\"Last Wordz\\",\\"Papa'z Song\\",.i'm personally shocked that representin 93,papas song,and deadly venoms wasn't released as singles as they have single written all over them.<br /><br />the album does has flaws however,the production for the most part hasn't aged verry well and thats probably the only real drawback to this album.
0385338686|3.0|Initially, I enjoyed reading The Undomestic Goddess. However, I began to get worried about the conclusion of the book when the climax (in my opinion) occurred 100 pages before the final ending. I feared then that the denouement and conclusion would be long, drawn out, and a bit ridiculous. As it turned out, my assumptions were correct. It felt as if the ending was out of a recipe book for a romantic comedy script. It seemed like she wrote it so that it could be converted into a movie. This made the ending very predictable and convoluted. Overall, I thought the book was OK, but I would have preferred a different ending.
B000069HZP|4.0|No, this isn't an autobiography on WWE star Triple H.<br /><br />This is \\"The Game\\" starring Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, an investment banker who apparently has forgotten, or never learned, how to be a kind human being. Mr. Van Orton is short, rude, and a pompous ass to every person he seems to come in contact with. His wealth and power have gone to his head in a big way.<br /><br />Then as a birthday gift, Nicholas' brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) gives him a present: a gift certificate to a company known as \\"CRS\\". Nicholas has no clue what he is in store for. When he eventually goes to CRS to fill out the forms and take the tests needed to get started, he is informed by cel phone during an important meeting that he has been rejected. But this is just a ruse, as from this point on, he is thrown into \\"The Game\\".<br /><br />Having to experience humility for probably the first time in his life, Nicholas finds himself in one catastrophe after another, and finds himself completely and totally out of his element as the events unfold in wicked fashion. In the end, he gets exactly what he deserves.<br /><br />I think we've all run into the Nicholas Van Ortons in the world at some point or another, and there's something satisfying about watching someone who believes to be above everybody and everything get knocked down to Earth. I wouldn't say this is a terrific film, but one that keeps you interested until the end.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|My review won't be helpful to anyone reading it, as I can only talk about it from pure feeling. I hide the fact that I own a copy of this film because I'm an older adult male. Shame on me for that, but that's how it is. I'm very glad to see so many reviews of high praise for \\"Dumbo\\". I always loved this film, but I always assumed it was taken for granted by most people and, like it's title character, considered the runt of the illustrious library of Disney classic feature cartoons. Many of these customer reviews prove me wrong. \\"Dumbo\\" is elegant in its simplicity, honesty, humor, and positive message of hope. As for the \\"Baby Mine\\" number....it's the reason I'll only watch \\"Dumbo\\" alone. No matter what your age, give \\"Dumbo\\" a chance. It may just become something very personal for you as it did for me.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Confession: I do not like the White Stripes.  I mean, I like music with some rough edges but there's something just too primitive about the Stripes that leaves me cold.  Even so, every now and then you'd get glimpses of things that made it apparent that Jack White was a capable and versatile musician and his work on Loretta Lynn's \\"Van Lear Rose\\" brought that point home even more.<br /><br />Which brings us to Jack's newest project, The Raconteurs.  Teaming up with fellow Detroiter, pop guy Brendan Benson, White has assembled what amounts to a 2006 version of The Kinks or Small Faces.  That is to say what we have here is a pop/rock band with all of the classic ingredients: great songwriting, hooks galore, a solid rhythm section, inventive arrangements and two capable lead vocalists.<br /><br />To be sure, there are plenty of rough edges and quirky sonic jimcrackery but they are always just one of numerous elements and never distract from the song.  Maybe this is Benson's pop sensibilities tempering White's noisy asides or maybe not but the end result is a CD that is interesting and fun to listen to and, really, what else matters?<br /><br />The opening track \\"Steady As She Goes\\" sounds fantastic and refreshing on the radio. A few more bands and releases like this and maybe rock can be revived from its current comatose state.<br /><br />By the way, the CD is exactly the right length.
B0009P42S2|4.0|The animations, illustrations and design of the visuals in Steam Boy has to be one of the top-notch in any ani-movie. The movements and settings of every character was rendered with the utmost care, with dramatic instrumental music to go with it. <br /> <br />Although the animations surpasses many other ani-movies, its lack in emotions and character development takes it quite far down the list. The story itself was confusing, not because of complexity, yet because the film had too much in too little time, giving the viewer barely any time to sum up the information. In short: too much, too soon. The film focuses a little overboard on the animations and effects instead of the story and characters, resulting in a totally non-emotionally driven film at all. If compared to other films of its own genre, such as AppleSeed, Steam Boy fails in many developmental and spiritual aspects. But if you are a fan of kick-arse animation, then this is the film for you. <br /> <br />Excellent, breathtaking scenes and good old classic music makes this film a must-watch for any fans who liked APPLESEED, or Akira.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Shrek (Two-Disc Special Edition)~ Guillaume Aretos (II) is a very good animated from SKG. The storyline is amazing, the dialogue is quik and witty. They have a truly allstar cast doing the voices with Michael Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and John Lithcow. Some of the scenes are comedy at its best and like the entire dragon scene and the scene in the begining with all the faires. I must admit that I was like really unsure whether I would like this movie at all. It did not sound at all like the animated movies that I usually like to watch. But to my big surprise I love it. The music is also very good even though some of the songs are a bit cheesy. Yeah it is very different from movies like Finding Nemo, Shark Tale and the like but it is still an amazing piece of work and just as good. This movie I highly recommend.
B000669GAI|5.0|Most of pearl jam's more popular song's are represented here and also a few fan favorites like Breath, State of Love and Trust. Normally I'm not a big fan of greatest hits but pj did make this worth buying for the fan that already has the songs on the popular albums by including the aforementioned songs and also song's like Man of The Hour, Last Kiss, Yellow Ledbetter. If you're a new fan this a great place to start. And old fan's may enjoy the remix's. (just sound remixes). It is odd that there is no Tremor Christ on here as it was their second most successful single ever. And the absence of In My Tree and Present Tense is nearly inexcusable. All in all though it is a good collection at a great price from one of the best band's in the world so you really can't go wrong with picking this one up and get the marvelous \\"Lost Dogs\\" while you're at it.
B0000256VK|5.0|Reading other reviews of this collection of songs prompted me to bang away at the keyboard and offer my own insignificant opion. <br /> <br />Wether or not you are in tune with the music on this disc one has to admit that the production is first rate. The band was at their peak and you can hear it in every note. <br /> <br />Secondly , I need to say that anyone who gave this album less than 5 stars ( o.k I'll settle for 4 ) are obviously....A.) Not musicians  B.) The operation they had to correct their hearing problem failed.  c.) Have no clue what production values are. <br /> <br />As good as Roxy Musics early stuff was this is without a doubt THE most difinitive album the made. This is a CD that I have gotten over a dozen non-Roxy fans to by. They won't touch anything else by this group but this album.
B000BBYMA2|4.0|I first heard of the movie Battle Royale through a discussion board and I thought man this sounds like a great movie. So I began looking for it in Libraries, blockbusters and other places I could get a dvd but I had no luck. <br /> <br />Then I saw it here on amazon and I bought it and after watching it, I thought it was better then I thought. I had action, gore and some comedy. It had it all. I didnt mind reading the subtitles because the movie was worth it all.
B000EYK4KI|1.0|what is with these unrated and newly found clips releases, I'm not going to buy another copy of this movie for a ending that was left on the floor and now a studio wants to release another version...<br /><br />Can I trade my old version for this one? Is there a trade-up option from the studio? Get it right the first time please!<br /><br />[reveiew for Mr. & Mrs. Smith - Unrated (2-Disc Collector's Edition) not the original widescreen release version, as the movie was good even with the cut scenes that made it on the first DVD release...]
B000683VI4|2.0|I have read \\"The Notebook\\" three times now. After I read it and fell in love with the story; I bought the book for a friend. She then became hooked on Nick Sparks work. I went to see the movie in the Theater and at the end of the movie was left feeling disappointed. I remembered things from the book that should not have been left out of the movie. And a few things were added to the story that should not have been.  The fighting and making out for instance was not in the book and should have been left out of the movie! After watching the movie I reread the book to see how my memory was of the book. I was even more upset after i finished reading. The book really is so much better. A beautiful love story that I will stick to reading over. I will not watch this movie again!
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I was one of those people that hated everything about Cabin Fever. I wasn't anticipating Eli Roth's next film, but when I heard the Internet buzz around Hostel, and found it was showing at the 2005 TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), I decided to check it out. <br /> <br />Eli Roth, who was at the screening, mentioned to the audience that this was the first public viewing in North America. He also told us what we were about to see was a work in progress print of the film. What I saw was one hell of a fierce horror flick that works on every level. <br /> <br />All the actors do a great job in this flick. I was especially impressed with Jay Hernandez, and Derek Richardson, two relatively unknown actors. There are a lot of funny scenes, and dialog in the early parts of the film. It's not that slapstick, forced stuff that was so prevalent in Cabin Fever. There also lots of nudity in the early parts in the film as well. When things begin to turn towards horror, you truly feel the sense of terror the characters are going through. The build up to the climax is just done so well. I loved the fact the story is very believable. <br /> <br />Make no mistake about it, this is a violent, sick, and gory flick. It's not for the squeamish. I haven't seen this type of extreme violence in a North America mainstream cinema. The Takashi Miike, and Asian Cinema influences are clearly seen here. <br /> <br />This is a film that will shock people, and remain in there heads well after the film is over. It will be interesting to see how the film is edited, and rated. In it's current state, I don't see how it could get anything less than the dreaded NC-17 rating. I just hope that it's not butchered too much, as the audience deserves to see the film how it was intended. Eli Roth has completely redeemed himself for what I thought was a very poor film in Cabin Fever, and has made one kick-ass horror film.
0790733226|5.0|A very classy movie. What I can write about it is going to understate, how good this film is. Its beginning gives no hint as to what it is about, but it culminates as so much more.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|\\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is now the new unofficial standard for double albums. If you can't make a set this good, then you just shouldn't try. I just can't believe how many GREAT songs there are!!! It keeps getting better and better the more I play it. I'm not even a huge fan. I only own one of their other albums, but \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" has reignited my interest in the Red Hot Chili Peppers all over again. I can't even pick a favorite song because it keeps changing.  Best album of 2006 so far. This will be hard for anyone to top.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is such a beautiful movie, a wonderful dvd for any collection. In search for a male heir to the Maori tribe, the current leader doesn't see what all even Nature could see, that the true heir is already with him, his granddaughter, Pai played beautifully by Keisha Castle-Hughes. This is such a quiet, inspirational film. In a world where we find numerous movies where males dominate, it's inspiring to find one that focuses on the female of the species.  <br />
B000002H33|5.0|Great metal ablum. Its more put together then prior albums. It reminds me of The Black Album and ...And Justice For All put together. The guitar, bass and drums are awesome as usual and the solos are not too long. And of course, props to James on the vocals. I cant really think of anything that is bad from this album. This is one of the best thrash/speed metal records out there.
0345349571|5.0|This historical account of the 14th century is amazing.  It covers the period before, during and after the plague.  Interesting that mankind seems to face the similar social issues during that time, as with the current centuries. Taxation, separation of church & state, anti-semitism, debates over Christianity and the limitation in social class and advancement.  Just amazing!  Although this follows the de Coucey lineage, it covers a global European perspective.  If you like any sort of history, this is an excellent book!!!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|At first I wasn't sure, but when I heard the album a second time it was a definite buy. It's an unusual blend of Electronica, Pop, Hip-Hop, and R&B that somehow works. It continues to grow on me the more I play it. It's something different so it's refreshing. Gnarls Barkley reminds me a little of Outkast. I love CRAZY, GONE DADDY GONE, SMILEY FACES, STORM COMING, and THE LAST TIME. If you're looking for something a little unconventional, then check this CD out.
B000BPG2JC|5.0|This book has delightful descriptions of Wyoming and the Big Horns.  And add to that characters that captured my interest from the first page to the last.

B00026KDC2|5.0|yeah if I had to survive on like ten albums for the rest of my life this one would be there. It seems to really fit all moods. Man you can take this to a house party and keep everybody dancing and grinding or just pop it in the car and take the girl out for a ride on some dark country road with the windows down and the warm air blowing in. Every song on this thing should have been a number 1 hit in the US but well top 40 radio was never accused of being high quality. This album will make you smile when you realize you didn't have to pay a million bucks for suck a joyous thing. Did I say I liked this album!
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I watched the movie today.  And I felt really cheated having waited for something like this after so long, but getting so little.  The movie itself, CGI, was attractively done.  Almost like watching a real movie.  Almost like watching real people acting and reacting to surroundings.  It would be interesting to see if the PS3 brings back FFVII and use these sorts of graphics.  In fact I hope that they do.  And yes, before you attack, thinking I know nothing about the original game, I am a big fan of VII, I still have it and still play it when the desire strikes.  And yet behind all this beautiful artwork, I felt like I was wanting more.  This wanting more comes in three bullets.<br /><br />One.  The villains were only \\"eh,\\" in the sense that they did not have the all important background given that would have made them more dangerous, more intriguing, more hateful by we the movie audience.  The villains were nothing more than three Sephiroths with different hairstyle per character.  Yes they were exciting in the battles, but CGI can only go so far, if there isn't a cemented background, I can only shrug and say \\"ok...what else?\\"  I would have loved to have had the movie get more involved into what was going on in the villain's mind beside wanting them to go find their \\"mom.\\"  I did not care for how the villains affected the main characters.  I wanted to, but couldn't.<br /><br />Two.  We only get to see a little bit of the other characters I myself grew to love in the original video game.  I'd love to have seen the others moving about, acting and interacting, but we dont see this.  We only get them \\"somewhat\\" in the final portions of the end battle.  The video game was not only about Cloud, though he was the main character.  What about Yuffie? Barret?  The others?  What all has happened to them after the ending of the original game?  How did they grow between the original game and the Advent Children movie?  What sort of demons did they go through due to what was happening to the children?<br /><br />Three.  The epic feeling was gone, though the children had been stained, you didn't really get involved in what they were going through, what they were feeling, they were just there to move the story along, not real people having real damage.  The original game was epic, you didn't just go around one city or some ruins, you went throughout the entire world intimately, powerfully, and there was an epic feeling to how each place was a portion of the greater story.  This was not there in the movie.  I got the feeling that the background was just that, background for another battle.  The background could have been a Chocobo farm for all the lack of importance.<br /><br />Sadly, what I suggest is this.  Rent the movie.  That's it.  It isn't worth the money unless you truly wish to have it, I have it, but, I dont know if I will see it again anytime soon...CGI can only go so far, I want substance and I want story and I want these indepth and intricate and passionate, just like the original game.was happening to the children?   <br /> <br />Three.

0224076051|5.0|Need cheering up?  Get this book after reading the review below by Lubos Motl, then try to find out how he fabricated his \\"review\\".  I'm a string theorist by the way, which is why I'm hiding behind a pseudonym (I don't want to be called a \\"science hater\\" by my seniors).  This book makes a surprising effort to explain abstract mathematical concepts.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I like the plot of the story which you can see Will's changes gradually from a self-centred to a caring, loving guy.  I like the way Hugh Grant protrayed Will, speaking with brutal tone. His boyish behaviour makes me laugh all the time, telling lies, chasing ambulance and ridding his life of all responsibilty. Above all, his sarcastic remarks,\\"the most killing is that both of them close their eyes.\\"   <br />Will is the real boy, instead of Marcus. On the contrary, Marcus seems to be more mature than Will. He knows how to care about his mum, though sometimes, he does in a wrong way.
0767805712|5.0|There is a profound conflict that runs throughout Gattaca -- superficiality versus true depth.  The citizens of the film's dystopic society are beautiful on the outside, but in contrast to the aesthetic societal standards of today, beauty on the surface is not enough here.  Humans have been genetically engineered to be perfect, right down to the very cells of which they are made.  This adds an additional layer to the outside/inside conflict with which we are all faced in 2006; today, there is beauty on two levels: the bodily level and the spiritual level (i.e., \\"the person inside,\\" as a simplified description).  In Gattaca, these layers still exist, but the third is perhaps most important -- beauty on a cellular level. <br /> <br />Vincent Freeman, played by Ethan Hawke in a nuanced and moving performance, is a testament to the fallibility of genetic engineering.  At birth, he was never given a chance, his parents having been told with 99% certainty that he would develop a heart condition and die by age 30.  He has always dreamed of leaving the world that is so prejudiced against the naturally born, the flawed, and finding his place in the infinite realm of space.  However, the hotshot scientists at Gattaca -- the preeminent aerospace insitute of the era -- let him in only to be a common janitor.  Why invest in someone so certain to fail? <br /> <br />Vincent is not content to watch, day after day, as manned rockets are sent into space to do the research and exploration for which he so desperately craves.  He knows that despite what geneticists and doctors have said, he is \\"as good as all, better than most.\\"  With the help of a shady underground businessman (Shalhoub), Vincent takes on a new identity: Jerome Morrow.  The real Jerome (Law) had been a world-class swimmer before an accident left him paralyzed, confined to a wheelchair.  Vincent changes his hair, gets colored corrective lenses, and follows an austere daily regimen to eliminate traces of his own \\"in-valid\\" DNA, to be replaced by conspicuously placed samples from the genetically flawless Jerome.  When the narrative picks up, Vincent, posing as Jerome, has a prominent place at Gattaca and is one week away from taking a year-long voyage to Titan, one of Saturn's moons.  With the murder of a director at Gattaca, however, his secret identity is thrown in jeopardy; crime scene investigators are determined to find the culprit, and a rogue eyelash leads them to the in-valid Vincent Freeman, whom nobody connects to the Jerome Morrow they know and respect. <br /> <br />From this premise, which is created subtly and smoothly by Niccol, Gattaca truly takes off.  Thurman's performance as Vincent's love interest, Irene, is pitch-perfect; she plays the character with a coolly detached elegance appropriate for the futuristic dystopia while maintaining a sympathetic air of humanity.  The relationship between Hawke's and Thurman's characters feels genuine (as it should, considering the actors' subsequent marriage), and that between Vincent and his cellularly perfect brother Anton (Dean) is complex but easily understood on a basic, universal level.  Many moments between the brothers are among the most poignant captured on film, especially in the science fiction genre (of which I am not normally a huge fan, but this movie is just remarkable). <br /> <br />I have watched this film several times and have yet to tire of it.  Though many pictures have been able to pull off sleek, futuristic looks, few of these have anything below the surface.  Gattaca does, and it packs an emotional punch.  There is a remarkably small number of movies that feel nearly perfect to me; Gattaca is one of them.  I would not change a single thing about it even if I could.  The characters are fully developed, the plot is intriguing and compelling, the cinematography and sets are beautiful.  What is truly amazing about Gattaca, however, is its ability to develop and show its viewers something absolutely vital: what it means to be human.
1400043662|5.0|According to R. Jackson (a theorist of fantasy literature), fantasy literature frequently features a phenomenon of psychological regression, where blurred becomes differentiation between objects, or time frames or spaces. In this novel, Kafka On the Shore, this may be happening literally. The adolescent boy, Kafka, undergoes the Oedipus Complex, which must have occured to his infancy, and Nakata is reduced to the mental stage, in which he cannot communicate with others properly as fit for adults, whether intellectually or emotionally. Especially, the character of Nakata is very attractive. His intellectual capacity may be that of a child, but only he knows what to do and how to do it to save the world, though the practical task of saving it is accomplished by his disciple (a truck driver, what was his name?). So the \\"child\\"-like Nakata is the real hero who saves the world. Does Haruki want to say (the source of) salvation lies in childhood? Like the poet Wordsworth or Jesus said? Wasn't Nakata a carpenter (if my memory is correct) like Jesus? Or are all these random associations just a bunch of baloney?
B000065LZQ|3.0|This album is loud, angry, and, honestly IMO, not very good.  I really don't like any of the songs on the album.  Wish is decent.  Help Me I'm in Hell is pointless to me.  I don't get it.  I give this album 3 stars just because this album blends its style together with Pretty Hate Machine to give us The Downward Spiral.  I'm not trying to hate on NIN. I really like Trent's music, just not this part of it.  Too vague, too loose, I'm not sure how to put it.  It's not overly heavy.  Chaotic might be the best way to describe it.

B000EGCITG|5.0|I had lost faith in my girl with Try This. I had to force myself to listen to that CD more than once to make sure that I really hated it as much as I thought I did. Because of that, I waited a long time to pick up I'm Not Dead.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't waited. I'm Not Dead is the best Pink yet. I love the bluesy parts, the rock kicks serious ass too. (Can I say ass in here?) I think we're finally seeing the real Pink. It is going to be one of my favorite albums ever.

B000001Y5X|4.0|This was one of the last CDs I managed to get by Manson. I think it was one of the best. Kinda perverted and weird but a good offering for anybody who likes this shock rockers style and music. I got used to him and now I listen to him on more or less a regular basis. Like others by Manson I don't agree with his messed up views of life and everything in it but it's music not gospel. Anybody that takes Manson or any other metal or rock group seriously should have thier head examined and check for a brain. At any rate this is a good Cd and the production picked up since Trent Razor took the production wheel.
0316172324|1.0|I am sad to say how disappointed I was with Blink. After reading Tipping point I expected this book to be another phenomenal book, making the complex simple. Alas it did what Einstien warned us about \\"Make things as simple as possible and not any simpler.\\"<br /><br />This book tried to argue that we need to let go of the logical thought and analytical thinking in favor of gut feelings. \\"Think\\" by Michael LeGault is a rebuttal to this book and I think it is worth reading in conjunction with Blink. Why? because  implications of pattern based thinking (whcih is how our brain processes information at the fundamental level) and what Blink argues for, is deeply powerful, yet is a fundamental imperative to use the carefully balanced approach in decision making that uses instinct and mixes it with analytical thinking. Without this balance our society can be regressing towards middle ages as opposed to advancing towards the next creative era of growth.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Call me infatuated by Michael Buble. Where has he been all my life? Since discovering his music at my health club after the holidays, I just can't get enough of his silky smooth stylings. <br />Buble's on in my spin class and in my car and in my office and in my library. Never have I felt this way about a singer before.  <br />I couldn't choose one favorite song, but I can't help but feel great every time Feeling Good plays.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it's a true example of how a movie should be done (no CGI!). Very realistic disaster epic with an array of Hollywood's most talented actors/actresses at the time. In fact this movie would go on to influence legislation to improve fire codes for skyscrapers. The only bad part about this movie is that it highlights how bad the movies that are put out today really are.<br /><br />The quality of the picture and sound on this release is superb. The surround mix doesn't come off too well, but the sound is loud and clear. There are over 30 deleted scenes on the second disc, all of which were taken from the TV version. A nice feature with these scenes is that they seperate the footage that was in the original theatrical release by making it black and white, and then making the deleted footage color. This is to show how the scenes were originally blended into the movie. According to the studio, the film was of too poor quality to mix into the full length feature on disc 1.<br /><br />The featurettes are a nice touch, with a few of the actors commenting on the making of their scenes. It's amazing how dangerous this movie really was to make. You also get some insight on Irwin Allen, the creator of this epic. The back story is great for younger fans who only got familiar with this movie years after its release like I did.<br /><br />One more thing: can't beat the price!!!

B000002B7U|4.0|I don't know if I have a favorite Ozzy album.  However I do know which Ozzy I listen to the most:  the Ulitmate Sin.  I don't know why, but I love the continuity of the whole album; I like how the whole thing is like one big song.  Sure it has the same sound throughout and same feel, but that is what makes it a good ALBUM.  This truly is a 'different' Ozzy album, much more 80's esque than his others (which seem to stand the test of time) and some hate the sounds and other adore it.   I believe that with regards to the Ultimate Sin, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Hearing these tracks individually might be a little strange, but I feel they compliment each other quite nicely. <br /> <br />I love running with this album; I don't know if its the beat or the continuity or lack of ballads, but it gets me hyped! <br /> <br />I really like Jake E. Lee's playing on this album, it is very precise and very polished - just as it should have been in the 80's.  His timing is great and his technique spectacular.  To me it is difficult to argue if Rhoads or Lee had better technique on the early Ozzy albums (Rhoads did have a much greater chance to show off though - Mr. Crowley anyone?).  If only he had a more distinctive sound - a la Wylde or Rhoads, he may have been remembered more.  He does have quite a good tone on this album though. ..... <br /> <br />I really don't have a favorite song on this album; to me the whole thing is one big song.  So with this album, you'll either love it or hate it, cuz the whole thing sounds the same - and I think that's good.

B000ETRCMQ|1.0|The myth of the Easter Bunny is 100 times more realistic than the plot twists in this movie.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|\\"Serenity\\" is one of the few sci-fi movies that I absolutely loved the first time I saw it.  I knew nothing about the television series \\"Firefly\\" at the time (though I have subsequently seen several episodes, and love them almost as much as the movie).  I am not a \\"cult follower\\" of any show/movie/band/author/etc.  \\"Serenity,\\" however, grabbed my attention right off the bat, for one simple reason: its smooth blend of action and comedy into one tight, well-acted picture.<br /><br />River Tam (Summer Glau) is a troubled teenage girl; troubled in the sense that she's psychic, and has incredible fighting powers.  Her brother Simon (Sean Mahr) has bought both of them a place on Serenity, a starship led by Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion).  However, with a deadly assassin (Chiwetal Ejiofor) in hot pursuit, Mal and his ragged band of outlaws are about to uncover a secret so vast, it could rip the universe apart.<br /><br />I'll admit, the plot seems kinda hokey.  But what makes a good sci-fi movie is not the plot (let's face it, the plot is ALWAYS hokey in this genre), it's how the plot is pulled off.  Director Joss Whedon manages to keep the film tight and taught, while the superb cast keeps it all human.  The outcome is this: a science fiction flick that is dark, funny, and delectible.  Whether you were a fan of the series, or are like me and knew nothing about it, you will enjoy this movie; there is literally something for everyone here.
B0007TKNII|2.0|\\"Phantom of the Opera\\" a movie based on the musical of the same name (by Andrew Lloyd Webber), based on the book of the same name (by Gaston Leroux), where a mysterious masked figure haunts both an opera and the heart of an aspiring young soprano. I've always wanted to see Phantom of the Opera in some for or other. He's always appeared to me to be classic horror figure, like Dracula. Missed the musical, so I caught the film on DVD. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. The music was nice enough, and the sets, though the whole \\"looking back forty years after it had happened\\" got in the way a bit. What really, really annoyed me though was the Phantom himself. He expects to be paid by the owners of the theatre, and to get nice seating for the works that play there. It's not like he once owned the theatre or anything, he just wants money.  He chooses a girl from her childhood to teach music, then wants to spoil any chance her childhood sweetheart Raoul has with her because he's going to marry her. He's a bit old for her! And the way he woos her, through trickery, lies and killing innocent people who get in his way! He's all too particular about music and how it should be performed, yet as far as I can tell has never been in an opera himself (not until near the end anyway). This all could have worked, but the way the Phantom does these things is just so ruthless, cold and spiteful, even in his romance. He comes off more like a bratty little music snob than a romantic anti-hero. I didn't feel captivated or feel sympathy for him at all. During the swordfight between the Phantom and Raoul in the cemetary, I was hoping that Raoul would kill him, actually, I was that fed up with the Phantom. Maybe it was this version of the story, maybe even it was the actor who played him (Gerard Butler). The special features (besides your standard behind the scenes stuff) include snippets of promotional footage from musicals of times past, including one with Michael Crawford as the Phantom. That Phantom seemed a lot more tormented, sensitive and likeable than the one seen in this film. <br /> <br />The whole thing just really bugged me, which is strange, because I usually like Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, period pieces and classic-style horror.
0684874350|3.0|Found this today at the annual library sale for $1 and now that I have read the reviews on Amazon I am anxious to read it.
6304708521|3.0|\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is a 50 minute or so TV special that the Beatles shot and directed in 1967, and originally was shown on Boxing Day in that year in England. John, Paul, George, Ringo and his aunt take a tourist bus around England, a ride where anything can happen, and some of that anything does. The many adventures they have include a foot and car race, watching a movie in a tent bigger on the inside than the outside, a stripshow, and a singalong on the accordion.    The first CD I ever bought was \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" by the Beatles, and I loved the music. I used to think to myself, \\"Wow, the film that goes with this soundtrack must be amazing.\\" I'd seen the video clip for \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and thought it was pretty neat. I wondered what the rest of the film would be like. I imagined a great little dance sequence with Paul singing to children in \\"Your Mother Should Know\\", I imagined lots of colour and wonder. A few people I knew didn't like it (they said that nothing happened in it) but I was sure it couldn't have been as bad as all that. I finally got my hands on a copy the other day and had a look.     Basically, it was better than my friends said it was, but still not nearly as good as I'd imagined it would be.    The music is, of course, great. Energetic drumming on the title track, nice early use of flange on \\"Blue Jay Way\\", \\"Fool of the Hill\\" is nice and whimsical. I could live without the \\"Death Cab For Cutie\\" song though, an Elvis-ish song sung during the strip show by some sleazy looking fellow (from the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah band).     There's a lot less of the actual Beatles than I expected, and hardly any Beatle banter. They're passengers, they're wizards too, but the film doesn't really seem to be focused on them. What is the plot focused on? It's hard to say, it's all very weird, but not in a colourful Yellow Submarine or a funny Monty Python way. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. Things will be happening on the tour and then they'll cut to a music video. The music feels a little tacked into the plot, which is a strange thing to do for a Beatles film. The music videos aren't too shabby though. I quite liked the ones for \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"Fool On The Hill\\".    For those who follow the \\"Paul is Dead\\" phenomenon, there's a couple of clues in this film. Paul wears a black rose while the other Beatles where red. The number of wizards is described by the narrator as four or five (a replacement for Paul perhaps). There's also the Walrus, of course. Personally, I reckon Paul's very much alive, and he'll probably outlive all the other Beatles, making these references very ironic.    Worth a look for Beatles fans, though I'd recommend seeing \\"Yellow Submarine\\" first. Definitely get your hands on the album though, the CD has all the Beatles songs from the film, plus classics such as \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\".
0380789035|4.0|This book is a must read for people who enjoy the alternative history and what-if scenarios that have become a main stay in the fiction world today.  While not an alternative history, it does present some intriguing ideas about godhood and what it means to be a god.  The gods in this book come from everywhere. They're not the classic gods that you learn about in elementary school, but instead Neil reaches back through time and pulls a mixture of gods from various obscure cultures that we are not exposed to in the classics. There are even some modern day gods created for the readers as well.<br /><br />The pacing of the book is short and fast.  Most of the character development is well done and you can see the progression of Shadow (the main character) as he evolves over time, from the day he is released from prison until the climactic finale, the reader grows with him.  Neil also brings in side characters throughout the plot that might at first seem to play a minor role, but build to significance as the story progresses, the clues are there if you know to look for them.<br /><br />This novel reads like a tripped out science-fiction novel/travelogue of one man's quest to find the American soul.  The undertone of this story is an intelligent and compelling fairy-tale that celebrates the lost spirituality of the past and laments modern American civilization.
B000EYK4KI|2.0|Adding to and commenting about the post earlier regarding \\"re-warming\\" of movies that have already been released once that get another release like this one. The problem is not that the studio just \\"happens to find\\" new material and decides to release a new version, the studios plan has ALWAYS been to release another version later, so you have to buy a another copy. (thats why its basically a good idea these days to wait a while to see if another version is planned). Personally I have been waitinga while now for a backlash against this practice by the studios. There is no other reason than to make more money for them. How do you know when to buy a movie when it first comes out or wait for another release later? Well, one rule of thumb is how big was the movie when it was first in theaters and does the release contain very few extras on its first outing. If there is only a trailer and maybe a featurette than you can be sure there will be more releases later on. It also depends what studio is bringing the movie out. If the studio is Paramount than you might be lucky and only have one release of a film because Paramount doesn't care very much about special features and so on, they are one of the worst studios to release DVDs. Hope this helped a bit.
0060853964|5.0|I read the re-release of Good Omens with a rather interesting afterword by both Terry and Neil.<br /><br />The apocolypse is on it's way, and a demon and an angel who have been living on earth for the past 6,000 years don't like to see their nice and comfy lifestyle go the way of a celestial war.  So they try to set up a stale-mate with the anti-christ balanced between them.  However, the anti-christ has been \\"misplaced\\", and is growing up somewhere in England.<br /><br />The 4 horsemen ride forth, and Revalations unfolds as these two angels (one fallen, the other just enjoying humanity) try to avert the final war.<br /><br />I thought the book was rather well written, although at times the writing style felt like it was joke-joke-joke, with one set-up after another and a few more inside jokes than what a first time reader of these two might be able to uncover.<br /><br />Overall it was a great weekend read.  I checked it out of the library Saturday afternoon and am done with it Monday.  I would recomend it for those long road trips or if you're ready to just relax for a weekend and enjoy a book that doesn't take too much thought.

0060557818|5.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman novel.  I'll read him again and again...The ending is what you expect, but better.  The characters are good (I especially like when Richard Mayhew writes notes in his mental diary) and you root for them, etc.  But the best part (even though it's been done before) is London Below, that other London with all its scarey characters and grimey places.  It was just so neat how he described it and created it for the reader.  It was definitely the best part for me. It is also a quick read, I read it in a day or less...so, that's good if you want something quick.  Anyhow, I recommend it whole-heartedly...
0385512058|5.0|Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi is the definitive guide to Networking 2.0. Keith has been referred to as one of the most connected individuals in the world, and in this book he shows you why.  <br /> <br />Keith was brought up a child of a working class, but was afforded a very expensive education through the contacts and ingenuity of his father, who worked for a prominent businessman. Ever since he became a caddie on the golf course as a youth, he has realized the value of relationships, and harnessed their power to help himself and everyone he knows.  <br /> <br />Never Eat Alone quickly debunks the notion that networking is handing out business cards to everyone you meet, or keeping track of who can do what for you, or who owes you what favor. This archaic form of doing business may have been the old school of networking, but in today's business world your relationships must be built on generosity, trust and integrity. Whenever you meet someone, you should think \\"How can I help this person? Who do I know that they should meet?\\" If you can positively impact someone's wealth, health or family, they'll forever help you out.  <br /> <br />One of the most useful tools in the book is what Keith calls his Relationship Action Plan (RAP). Your RAP consists of three columns - what I want to do, who can help me, and how do I meet them. At the beginning of each year, make a new RAP and figure out who you need to meet in order to achieve your goals for this year. Carry around a list of the top few people you need to meet, and always think about how you can get in touch with them.  <br /> <br />This book has been recommended to me by many people from different walks of life, from my business coach to a past president of the Canadian Medical Association, and everyone loves it for the same reason: Never Eat Alone provides a definitive guide to building mutually beneficial relationships that help everyone succeed. No matter what phase of the business cycle you are in (even if you're still in school) this is a book that you need to add to your personal and business development library.
B00003CX9S|5.0|Now, i'm no stranger to shocking and creepy/haunting films. Having seen all of Lynch's AWESOME films, i knew that after the incrfedible reviews that this got, i had to see it. Well, this is a movie that will leave you sitting for half an hour, reflecting on life and human emotions. <br /> <br />I have seen some of the overall saddest/most violent/haunting films that there is to see, and this takes the cake. THIS IS NOT A TEAR-JERKER. To me, the meaning of a 'tear-jerker' is a movie that makes you weep because something bad happened, this is sort of the same, but it's also miles away. <br /> <br />I cried after seeing this film. I'm not afraid to admit it, because i would think that anyone who did not, or at least feel deeply moved, had something wrong with them. <br /> <br />During the film, there were several moments when i felt an incredible warmth. Something like a desire to help people as unfortunate as Joseph Merrick. I also was severely creeped out by  scenes like when Treves first sees the elephant man, in a dark and filthy rock dungeon, lit by candle-light. That is one of the best scenes ever made. <br /> <br />This film is really something that you want to share with someone special. Filmed in beutiful black-andwhite that brings out the true feeling of the film, and also creates a sense of the era. <br /> <br />David Lynch is certainly, with no doubt in my mind, one of the greatest directors of all time. This is largely due to his astonishing ability to bring out the deepest of emotions. Joseph Merrick was such a beutiful person, and it does really crush your heart when you see the ugliness of man, how he is treated because he looks different. But, it is not a film about judging a book by it's cover. It is simply about the darkness in man, the deepest of emotions, and the beauty of life. It really is an incredible mix. In this film, you feel emotions that are as strong as any you will ever feel in real life. <br /> <br />This is THE greatest film of all time. I strongly, strongly, advise anyone to see it. It is a cut above the rest of modern film making, and there is, quite plainly, no other film like it.
076790382X|5.0|I loved this book.  I am not a critic... just a person who thought this book was hysterical.  I never laugh aloud reading, but did on this one.  He has a great dry sense of humor that matched mine.  I would recommend to anyone.. only exception would be other big writers and critics... I am sure they would rip his book for something.  I liked his other book about hiking the Appalachian Trail too, but this one was funnier.
B0002Y69NG|3.0|By no means is the Matrix trilogy the next Indiana Jones or Star Wars Trilogy. Although after seeing the first film, one might put that into question. But...after that it goes a little down hill. I'll try to keep this short and sweet.    The Matrix: A classic film that is a legend in it's own rights. Very entertaining and fun to watch. Almost perfect. 5 Stars.    The Matrix Reloaded: One of the biggest letdowns in the history of sequels. It doesn't even begin to compete with the original. One wonders what the directors were really thinking. Although, not very well written, or acted, Reloaded can be entertaining, in a minless action kind of way. Although very disappointing, it's not the worst. 2 1/2 Stars.    Matrix Revolutions: Often the most criticized of the Matrix films, it's not nearly as bad as many people would have you believe. As with the second film, it wasn't written very well. In the end you wonder what could have been, and why it had to be this way? On the other hand, I was entertained the entire film, and it was very enjoyable. 3 1/2 Stars    Animatrix: I really don't understand the praise this gets. I didn't like the way it was done and some of the stories were horrible. 1 1/2 Stars    All in all, it's a pretty good buy. Especially for that price. It's a very entertaining, if not well done, trilogy. Definitely worth a watch.
044100590X|5.0|For one reason or another, I put off reading this \\"classic\\" for years. What can I say? If you haven't read it... read it. It's wonderful storytelling. The tale incorporates recognizable political and religious references without being trapped in specifics of previous or current historical events. A grand tour indeed.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I'll go ahead and echo what a lot of reviewers have already stated: whether you like this movie or not is probably dependent on your experience with the game. The plot of the movie is actually pretty straightforward-- but following it absolutely requires a working knowledge of the game's characters, locations, and events. <br /> <br />If nothing else, seeing these beloved characters move and fight in stunningly lifelike CGI is thrilling, and the film is littered with visual and musical nods to the game that fans will love. The fights are amazing, showing a clear \\"Matrix\\" influence but taking it in a unique direction. <br /> <br />It's too bad that the writers could not have come up with something that would have pleased devoted fans and newcomers alike, but speaking as a fan, this movie is definitely a satisfying continuation of the Final Fantasy VII story. <br /> <br />Be sure to listen to the Japanese language track; the English dub is a monotonous mess that really sucks the life out of the movie.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I too, agree with other comments that people are leaving, as to how many more times does George Lucas intend for the public to buy these movies all over again. I had two additions of this movie on Video Cassette, I thankfully never invested in laserdiscs, and now own the complete set on DVD. I thought the enhanced visuals and scenes did sort of add to the movie, although I did not like the fact they digitally removed the original Anakin Skywalker from the end of Return Of The Jedi, and replaced him with the new Anakin Skywalker from Revenge Of The Sith.  <br /> <br />Now all that being said I have to admit I would probably by these DVD's for the option of being able to chose which version I want to watch, there is something to be said for the classic, remembering the films I loved growing up. I would however beg George Lucas and Lucasfilms to make this the last re-issue of the film, and maybe turn his attention to making something new. Lets not forget, Betamax tapes, VHS, Laserdisc, and now DVD do we really think this is going to be the last format they will invent.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|My one question is, for those who have a copy of this particular DVD edition being advertised here: is this particular version a multi-, or all-region DVD? I live in the U.S., and I'd really like to get THIS version due to all the special features, but obviously I don't wanna get it if it's not even going to play in my DVD player... anyone know??  <br /> <br />But for those who aren't wound so tightly as to be offended by the risque premise (a buncha students are kidnapped, taken to an island, and given weapons to kill one another off), and HAVEN'T had the privilege of seeing this wickedly entertaining film, you owe yourself to do so. Fans of transgressive art, black comedy, dead baby jokes, Takeshi Miike, Bret Easton Ellis, Palahniuk, and Tarantino will be right at home watching it (case in point, not only is this one of Tarantino's favorites, its influence on him is evidenced by his casting this film's Chiaki Kuriyama to play Gogo in his own \\"Kill Bill\\"). Take it from me though and skip the unengaging sequel. Also recommended: \\"Series 7: The Contenders.\\"  <br /> <br />
B000BJS4BM|5.0|In this futuristic disco tour de force, the Queen of Pop shows us once more her real knack for combining dance and song. 23 years after she first started off with \\"Everybody\\", Madonna's proven to be an artist who adopts to the new generation and isn't an 80's or 90's has-been. This album ROCKS and is her best work (maybe even better) than 1998's RAY OF LIGHT, which, in my opinion, is the second greatest Madonna album of all time (and I'm proud to say this album's the first). The way Madonna and Stuart Price do it is very clever - 12 dance songs a la disco, mixed into one long track as a non-stop CD, plus one [unmixed] bonus track at the end. Truly, this is a milestone in the story of dance and pop music set by our very own Material Girl, the Queen of Pop!      1. HUNG UP (5:36) - The first single to be released, it's a massive international hit, reaching #1 in FORTY-THREE countries (including my own humble Philippines). It's built around ABBA's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\", and is only the second song ABBA has granted license to sample their music. The entire CONFESSIONS album opens with a tickling clock followed by our catchy line \\"Time goes by so slowly\\". The song makes you want to rush straight to some dance floor and get into the groove. No wonder it's a massive hit!!! At the end, the tick is heard again, and segues straight into... 2. GET TOGETHER (5:30) - The third single to be released. Though it didn't chart well in the US, the song is still a hit and Billboard gave it a warm review. The clock rings at the beginning, and the song tune immediately becomes slower. According to Billboard, the song was called a hypnotic space-age thumper, and they couldn't be more right. Like the previous track, it makes you dance, but this tune is rather different. As it implies, get your friends and get together! The song will segue straight into 3. SORRY (4:43) - the second single. This song sounds more futuristic, and the usage of multiple languages in apologizing plus the looping \\"I've heard it all before\\" greatly fits here. Though the song reached only #58 on the US charts, it was a massive dance and radio hit. The tune of the song sounds, in my opinion, somewhat like \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Toxic\\" combined, and they produce a very good result. The song continues into 4. FUTURE LOVERS (4:51) - sounding also very futuristic and has Madonna speaking spoken words. It also has a kind of looped lyric (\\"In the evidence of its brilliance\\"). The song makes you conjure up images of some bright sunny place like a Hawaiian beach where you can also shake your body. A more clever seguing brings us to track #5, I LOVE NEW YORK (4:11). It's her real confession on this album, as she also pays tribute to the city that first shot her to fame. It sounds like \\"Future Lovers\\", and makes you think of the Big Apple itself. However, the criticism of other cities (ex: \\"Los Angeles is for people who sleep\\", \\"Other cities always make me mad\\") is the only thing I don't like, because Madonna labels New York as the ONLY good city. Seguing into #6, LET IT WILL BE (4:18), the tune becomes a sort of up-and-down tune (as I describe it), and Madonna's voice becomes childish again. The song's cute, and I like the lyrics. The similar-sounding FORBIDDEN LOVE (4:22) is the 7th song, and starts with a sort of synthesizer. Madonna tells a story about \\"a boy\\" and \\"a girl\\" whose hearts intertwined. This song is rather calmer and slower than all previous songs, and seems to return to 90s pop. The guitar-like sound effects segue into the next song, the 8th track, JUMP (3:46). This song returns to futuristic disco theme, and is the fourth single from the album. It was originally to be the third single, but \\"Get Together\\" intervened. The song will really make you want to jump. The seguing into track #9, HOW HIGH (4:40), is a very soft one - it's kind of similar to the very first part of Britney's \\"Overprotected\\", followed by Madonna whispering \\"how high\\". This song is more lively than the others. The title does not refer to how high one will jump, but rather - \\"how high are the stakes\\". The song will segue into the controversial track 10, ISAAC (6:03). It's controversial because the Isaac was thought to be rabbi Yitzhak (Isaac) Luria, and rabbis' names are not allowed to be used as profit, but Madonna insisted it was Yitzhak Sinwani, who sung vocals here as well. It has a lovely Hebrew chant (\\"Im-ninalo\\" - If they were locked) sung by Sinwani. The song, in my view, sounds like a \\"Hung Up\\" influenced by Hebrew. The end of the song starts the intro for PUSH (3:57), the 11th song, which is like a thank-you message to the unknown \\"pusher\\" who inspired Madonna to \\"go the extra mile\\", etc. In my opinion, it's the song that I can dance LEAST to, because I think it's more of a balladish tune than a dance one. When the song ends, a tune very similar to \\"Frozen\\", Madonna's 1998 hit, is heard, and segues straight into the acoustic guitar-intro (also like \\"Frozen\\"), the concluding 12th track of the non-stop work, LIKE IT OR NOT (4:31). The song has references to the garden of Eden (\\"I'll be the garden, you be the snake; all of my fruit is yours to take\\"). The song is like \\"Frozen\\" crossed with \\"Sorry\\". After her singing, the acoustic guitar closes the album.     But wait! There's more! FIGHTING SPIRIT (3:32) is the 13th track and first bonus track of COADF. It has a very inspirational message, especially for lovers (\\"Keep the fighting spirit of love\\"). The song starts with some sort of keyboard/drum combo and ends with Madonna cooing the title.    And if you have downloaded it, try the 14th and final track (download only), SUPER POP. The intro sounds something junglish, and then dramatic playing. Like the previous track, there is a message - \\"If you want to reach the top, reach the top. If you do you'll never stop\\". I like the way Madonna sings her verses here - \\"If I was an (X) I'll be a (Y)\\". Fading drums really close the album now.     All-in-all, Madonna has created a perfect dance disc. Twelve continuous songs and one (two) bonus track(s). Isn't it great, or what?
0345457684|5.0|Skip a few hundred years and humanity has colonized the stars. Yet, despite our technical prowess and almost magical ability to manipulate nature, violence, hatred and desire for power still exist. Only now it's much worse because the technology devoted to killing, maiming & torturing is much more refined.  Enter Kovacs, a trained \\"Envoy\\" (special soldier) from another world. He wakes and the last thing he remembers is being killed along with his gal pal.  In the future an implant records all brain activity so after death this device is uploaded to a \\"sleeve\\" - a body without a mind - and the dead person is once again, alive. Sleeves can be clones or worse, the bodies of those whose minds have been downloaded to a virtual prison. <br /> <br />Earth is run by the United Nations yet behind the scenes the old ones (Meths) determine outcomes. Kovacs is given a new life by a Meth in order to solve an intriguing crime. With the sometimes assistance of a determined female police captain, he explores the seamy side of existence on this dreary planet replete with virual existences and bio-enhanced drugs as ubiquitous as the common cold.  Yet love, hope and goodness still exist. The ensuing drama is too convoluted to explain but despite a little murkiness at times, the story concludes successfully - so successful that a sequeal followed.  <br /> <br />High points are characterization, imagination, plot and the writing which at times was elegant, even poetic. Low points are the utterly horrifying portraits of a civilization gone bonkers, of technological feats beyond our scope, of a future world in which people (especially women) are simply commodities - a world without a spirit. Perhaps that is the future - I just don't want to see it.
074322454X|5.0|This novel was absolutely stunning.  I read it as I watched each episode of the corresponding miniseries, and found that it fleshed out the plot and characters much more than the miniseries alone.  The language was descriptive and fluid, with each character being developed nicely.  What made me unable to stop reading was not the action, but the relationships that these men shared, living in foxholes and becoming closer than family to each other.   <br /> <br />A must read for anyone interested in World War Two history.
B000E6EHGI|5.0|This remastered album is what I expected when I first heard they were adding bonus tracks to the boxset.  I don't really want live versions of songs taken out of context, unless it's something really rare.  What I want are intimate studio jams from the time when they were recording, and boy does this deliver!  Don't get me wrong, the \\"Mars Hotel\\" remaster has some extra gems, like \\"Wave that Flag\\", but if I already have the entire show with that performance I'm not interested.  However, NOBODY, as far as I know, has any of the jams that are featured here, and that's certainly saying something.  So thank you, because we all know the tapes were always rolling.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|I don't generally review movies because, frankly, I see too many of them.    I did see this movie and feel that a review is warranted.    Like many, many other people, I was turned off by the whole \\"brokeback propaganda machine\\".    Let's be frank, here.    1.  This is not a \\"brave\\" movie.  A gay movie in Hollywood is not a shocking thing.  This thing had \\"oscar winner\\" written all over it the moment somebody said, \\"let's make overtly gay cowboys\\".  Wanna see a \\"brave\\" movie in Hollywood?  Show me a movie about a nice, faithful man who is a good father and husband where religion is a large part of his life.    I can name a lot of movies with gay themes.  I can't name many fundamentalist christian movies.  I'm neither gay nor a fundie.  I'm just calling it like I see it.    2. This is not a low budget movie.  It had a production budget of $14 million and a cast of at least 5 relatively well-known actors and two who, even before the movie, were some of the hottest properties in Hollywood.      3. I wasn't in that much of a hurry to see the movie.  I have nothing against gay people, but if you ask me what I want to see, it's almost always going to be a comedy.  There's enough sadness in the world already.  I want to be entertained, not depressed.  That doesn't make me a homophobe.  It just means that a gay cowboy movie isn't something that excites me.  Nor does a movie about a forbidden love story between two morbidly obese people.  I don't hate fat people, either.  Nor do I think anything about their \\"love\\" is bad in any way.  It's just not something I'm going to rush out and see.    So, those were my three biggest objections to the movie:  it wasn't \\"brave\\", it wasn't a low-budget indie, and if people don't want to see it, that doesn't make them bad human beings.    Yet, the buzz was all against that.  The way this movie was played up, you'd have thought it was the reincarnation of the Godfather Part II.  I've seen $200 million blockbusters that didn't get this muchpress.    In the end, the box-office was respectable, but not at all amazing.  I think it ended up grossing about the same as that Kirsten Dunst Movie \\"Bring It On\\" about cheerleaders.      So, the hype was a major, major turn-off.  The only thing this was missing was Brokeback soft-drink cups at Burger King.    We rented the movie.  I have only one criticism of the movie:  Heath Leger mumbles.  Yeah, cinema verite and all that.  I know people mumble in real life.  For obvious reasons, I don't think I'm being unkind when I say that this is not a desireable thing in the movies.  I felt like I was watching Billy Bob Thorton in Slingblade half the time.      Okay, all that having been said:  this was a very, very good movie.  I found it to be very well-made, very-well acted, very well written.  It is, in a nutshell, a great work of art.    Movie of the year?  No.  Not nearly, and again, this is where the hype, I think, generated a lot of backlash.  It was great in its own way, accomplished everything it could have and did a great job.  However, I don't think it nearly met the standard of, say, Memoirs of a Geisha.  (Also a look into another world and a story of forbidden love, I might add.)    This was meant to have an indie feel and it does.  In fact, the one thing that set the production apart from a true indie movie is that the acting was so good.    I've heard people say they didn't like Ennis (Heath Leger's character.)  Duh!  So, because he's playing a twink, the guy needs to be likeable?  Who said there can't be unlikeable gay people?  Are we under some delusion that all gay people need to be cheery and fluffy?  I assure you that putting Richard Simmons in a cowboy hat would not have improved this movie.    The movie did a good job of introducing Ennis as a young man with no real plans in life (like most young folks, frankly) and watching him evolve into a surly, angry, violent, selfish jerk.      The undertone is that it's his frustration and repression that aremaking him a very, very disagreeable person.  Or maybe he's just an a-hole.  If he had been straight, maybe he would have been just as big of an a-hole.    Who says the protagonists in a love-story have to be likeable at all?  Are jerks not allowed to fall in love?  Like the opening words to Anna Karenina:  \\"happy families are all the same...\\"  They're boring, which is probably why so few movies are made about them.    Unhappy families, we are told, are all unhappy in their own way.  This is the story of an unhappy family, or set of families.    I think nearly everybody who saw the movie fell in absolute love with Michelle Williams.  Oh, that poor girl.  Makes us hate Ennis all the more, doesn't it?  That he has a salt of the earth woman and will screw her over?      I was leery of any sort of \\"gay agenda\\" being pushed in the movie and frankly, there wasn't one.      The fears that Leger had are real today, and were especially so in the past.  We know that a person can be killed simply for being gay.      It's an ugly fact of polite society that if you drift outside of accepted norms, there are some people who are so stupid and narrow-minded that they will react with violence.  If you're gay, or atheist, or polygamist, or any other number of (what I consider to be) harmless persuasions in life, there are those who not only won't accept you, but will take it as their mission to end you.    So, Ennis' fear is real, and the movie explains that he had a particularly horrific episode when he was 9 years old related to the concept of violence against gay people.  Maybe that's why he grew up to be such a jerk.  I would think that growing up knowing people would murder you if they found out who you were would be a heck of a thing to live with.    Anyway, this was a very, very good movie and I enjoyed watching it.  Without the hype, I probably would have seen it sooner.      A note about the soundtrack:  good lord, talk about over-rated.  A few minimalist, simplistic guitarriffs thrown in here and there.      At the end, there's a SWELL of that same guitar riff and it's like the dumbest kid in the middle school's A/V club got control of the mixer.      If this is a great soundtrack, then \\"bear in the big blue house\\" is the next best thing to Mozart.  I'm surprised the closing credits didn't have the cast singing \\"goodbye, goodbye, good friends goodbye...\\"
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice's \\"O\\" is one of the best produced albums I've ever heard. There are so many absolutely magical moments on this album. Rice's brilliant songwriting is aided so much by the masterful engineering process and mastering work that has gone into this album. It is rare to hear an album where the men behind the soundboard work to evoke as much emotion as the band is.<br /><br />If you had any doubts about this album, just listen to either \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" or \\"I Remember.\\" Each of these tracks start from very humble beginings and billow to heart-stopping climaxes. The mixing on this album was executed with careful attention to dynamic range. The way that \\"Cheer's Darlin'\\" fades away to nothingness as a tinkling piano teeters off into darkness is absolutely astounding. The fullness of the string arrangements on \\"Amie\\" and \\"Eskimo\\" give the songs the illusion of an eighty piece orchestra backing up Rice. The lower end of the spectrum is quite incredible as well. On both \\"Cannonball\\" and \\"Older Chests,\\" Rice uses intimate settings of mostly just acoustic guitar and vocals to create a sparse but interesting texture for these lighter pieces. \\"Cannonball\\" is a sea of intricacy as three or four guitar parts have been expertly overdubbed to sound like a single player. \\"Older Chests\\" uses multiple vocals and an occasional sighing cello to create a thick creamy sound, almost like listening to chocolate pudding. Another place where overdubbed vocals are used very effectively is at the end of \\"Volcano\\" where the band fades and a multi-phonic vocal track is left exposed and vulnerable.<br /><br />This recording sounds great. I haven't heard an album with as much attention to texture and musical color since Radiohead's \\"O.K. Computer.\\" This album is very similar to the aforementioned. Colorful textures, brilliant songwriting, haunting lyrics all pulled together with an obsessive attention to detail. \\"O\\" is easily one of the best albums of 2003. No music library could be complete without it.d be complete without it.
B00002DE0S|4.0|This is a very very good Piano Concerto interpretation and execution. However Krystian Zimerman, despite being as polish as Chopin, does not rise to the ocassion at all times during the Chopin Piano Concertos, and I have to say, the playing is excellent, the interpretation is supreme, but this is not Chopin by a long shot.<br /><br />Take the first movements of both concertos, staring with #1. An Allegro Maestoso is supposed to be played like an Allegro Maestoso not like a scherzo or a molto maestoso. He does this flip from a blue feeling to a rhapsody playing (and viceversa) that sounds more like Listz or Brahms than a 19 year old passionate prodigious. The second concerto's frist movement again is filled with waves that sometimes make you feel you're listening to a Largetto and again a rhapsody, which this is not. Just listen to Ashkenazy play Chopin solo works and you will likely understand the man himself. Magaloff is also a reference for Chopin's playing.<br /><br />A better version ? Although I'm not fond of Arrau playing Chopin, I own and prefer his version of both concertos, mostly because of the solist. If you haven't listened to them, I recommend you to do so, as his playing comes in more fluid, natural and consistant with the sheet -and with Chopin's personality-. The orchestation of Zimerman is excellent, and have to admit superior than Arrau's + London which feels somewhat missplaced at times, but as I said the piano execution is not Chopin.<br /><br />All in all a very good piano concerto for someone who hasn't listened to other interpretations, so don't be surprised if you find superior versions.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|I have the Japanese edition of this movie as well and I have to agree that it needs some heavy editing. I played the game and I still found its obvious lack of proper editing more than a little annoying. <br /> <br />Now, obviously, this movie is targeted at a niche market, otherwise there would be better back-story build-up. So, on the one hand, if you're a fan of the videogames, by all means, pick this up. <br /> <br />On the other hand, if you're a casual fan, you'll find this to be mediocre at best. You may find the artwork to be alright but it's not even the best of its genre -- to put it in perpsective, the original Ghost in the Shell's artwork was better.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Love between two men is expressed the same way as love between a man and a woman.  The dynamics are exactly the same.  I didn't really understand that until I saw this movie.  More proof there's nothing deviant or weird or perverted about homosexuality.  It makes homophobia that much more difficult to comprehend.  And if love is the foundation of marriage, and love is the same whether it's between two people of the same sex or between a man and a woman, then where are the anti-gay marriage people coming from...?  I don't understand.  I just don't understand.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Lot's of great comments and commentary on this truly \\"epic\\" film. <br /> <br />I would only add that this film (and the portrayals within) could only occur because of the correct recipe for success. <br /> <br />The locations and supporting roles were tempered just right to showcase the center. The action was also used as a backdrop and not a centerpiece.  <br /> <br />And Jerry Goldsmith's score could not have been better. John Williams is a master himself but Jerry to me has always done best capturing the \\"soul\\" of a centrally themed character like Gen. Patton or Daniel \\"Rudy\\" Rudiger. I can hear the haunting echoes across the Roman battlefields of North Africa and the jaunty sound of convoys moving accross Italy even as I type this. <br /> <br />How rare to find a biopic that knowing it cannot remain perfectly true to events and circumstances without becoming a documentary; still managers to capture the essence and soul of the subject. Kudos to all for such a masterpiece of writing, acting, direction and production! <br /> <br />I am so pleased that Patton continues to be improved and re-released as process improvements become available and new commentaries are recorded. <br /> <br />I will enjoy this for years to come!
1594200106|5.0|I haven't been this fond of a novel since Caleb Carr's The Alienist. Take care of your your errands before you settle into your favorite chair, because you'll be drawn into the book within the first eight pages and won't want to stop reading.  A debut novel that has it all--history, mystery, romance, comic relief, a stellar cast of characters.  Savvy readers will be able to solve some of the mystery early on, but there are plenty of surprises to keep you reading straight through to the last page.  By the time I had reached the final pages, I was in tears.  The prose and imagery are breathtaking, an absolute feast for the senses.
044024157X|3.0|I bought this book before a transatlantic flight and hoped to spend a few enjoyable, thrilling hours as I usually do with Grisham books. No such luck.<br /><br />The Last Juror is tedious, slow-paced, and - not like Grisham - predictable. The reason I am giving it 3 stars and not a lower rating is that, despite all, Grisham is a gifted writer and creates lively characters who are easy to sympathise with, and there is the occasional spark of humor. The end of the story somewhat lifts the overall impression (sorry, no spoiler here...) but I got to it already tired and frustrated, so the overall aftertaste is not what I am used to feel after good old Grisham books.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|That seems to be the theme of this movie, though Speilberg claims that this was not meant to be a criticism of Israel.  <br />At the end of the movie our hero wonders what all this was really about and if anything was truly accomplished. Yes, most of those responsible were killed- so what.  For everyone killed, two more were willing to step up to the plate. A great cast and movie. My only gripe:  the way our hero had flashbacks of the event, yet he wasn't even there. <br />
B0006ZE7G2|2.0|In a visual perspective, it's provocative, shocking, and highly disturbing to the point of it being too overwhelming for words...but overall, the movie creeped me out!
B00008NRL8|3.0|2 1/2 stars    Fun, accessible electronic hybrid of tango and techno yields less then it's promise. This music can serve as some interesting background to any pseudo-cultured affair one would want to hold, although when brought under a microscope the tunes here sadly coast through like clockwork. Pity, seeing the huge promise this unique sound the band has crafted hardly begin to express it's inner logic, let us hope for some further articulated sound on future releases.
055321277X|4.0|After reading Jekyll and Hyde for the first time, Stevenson's wife was so horrified that the author burned his only manuscript. Fortunately for us, he re-wrote it---in three days.  <br /> <br />No one today will react to J&H the way RLS's wife did. We're too desensitized to horror and violence. And consider: whereas many people envision Hyde as some ten-foot brute, he is instead described in the book as a hairy little dwarf who roughs up little girls.  <br /> <br />But what J&H did for literature, and the reason why it is still important to read, is that it explored the dichotomy of human nature, which is partly what makes us such flawed beings. It also single-handedly gave birth to a pantheon of 20th century creatures, from the wolfman to the Incredible Hulk. <br /> <br />This is a quick read---perhaps too quick. It is written with great economy and the right amount of description of Victorian London's seedy side. The chilling ending asks the reader to sympathize with Dr. Jekyll, whose evil twin is gradually taking more and more control of his faculties.
B000003C2S|5.0|Spiritual Healing is oftentimes seen as the black sheep of the Death catalogue. It doesn't seem to have it's place anywhere. There are the first two Death albums, Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy which show the original, raw and heavy side of Death. Then there are Symbolic, Human, Individual Thought Patterns and The Sound of Perseverence which display a very heavy and technical side to death.     In between these two phases of Death lies Spiritual Healing, Death's third offerening. It's rather a transition album. Instead of Chuck writing about horror and gore, he starts talking about more wordly and political issues. The musicianship also starts to change a bit. Chucks voice becomes a little bit higher as displayed in the latter generation of Death albums and everything becomes more technical.     This album is a great album and it is seemingly ignored by most. The fact is that the musicianship has improved since Leprosy and all of the songs are Killer tracks.     Basically, Spiritual Healing is a cross between Leprosy and Human, and it is great. This is probably the hardest to find of all Death albums, so get it if you come across it.

B00005ATQH|4.0|This is a classic movie of a great book by Nabokov. It is true the story may be some kind of scandalous for somebody, but the movie is just a pleasure to watch, and it just gets better with the time. Kubrick is a great director and the cast is also amazing in here. I'm just wondering if the movie would be better with some sex in there (there is none at all, it was 1962...), but I am not sure about it. The first scene of the shooting is memorable, and the first time we get to see Lolita is mesmerizing. I watched this movie a long long time ago, and I am happy I bought it now and watch it again. I recommend this movie to everybody, and for me it is a classic that would deserve to be among the best 100 movies ever.

B000021XR5|4.0|The band started out as a formulaic grunge band with some catchy, heavy tunes, then ventured into more psychedelic rock/grunge with their best album Purple. Tiny Music was pretty much a glam pop rock album full of dreamy, psychedelic moments, but was not very consistent. No. 4 saw STP combine all of their past styles into one solid and successful comeback album.<br /><br />The heavier side of the band is in full swing with the towering riffs of \\"Down\\" and the energetic \\"Heaven & Hot Rods\\". Other heavy rockers include \\"No Way Out\\", a classic STP rock song ala Purple/Core days, full of distorted heavy riffs and Weiland's harsher vocal delivery. \\"Sex & Violence\\" is another rocker that recalls the glorious Purple album, combining catchy melodies with crunching guitar playing.<br /><br />STP have always been very good at writing catchy, elegant melodies and harmonies, and No. 4 continues this in style. \\"Sour Girl\\" is a sumptuous ballad executing some ethereal, dreamy vocal melodies. The closer \\"Atlanta\\" is one of my favourite STP ballads to date, drenched in a calming, summery atmosphere. Weiland and the band breeze through these songs with ease, demonstrating their ability to create fine pop tunes.<br /><br />Overall No. 4 is something of combining of their previous three albums. It contains the heavier, grungy tracks from the Core days, the grunge-meets-pop of Purple, and the psychedelic moments found on Tiny Music. A solid album, and well worth a listen if you're a fan of STP's early works, or just a fan of rock melodious rock music.
B00006I53S|5.0|I love this lens, I've only had it for a month and I've tested it in situations that usually require me to use a tri pod.  <br /> <br />I've taken pictures using different shutter speeds and this lens really does reduce the blur of the image significantly. <br /> <br />Remember now it ONLY REDUCES BLUR in the pictures, it doesn't get rid of it. In my test, I can honestly say that you can get good pictures without using a tripod using shutter speeds of 1 second max, any slower and I can't hold the camera lens stedy for any longer.  But use any faster shutter speeds you'll definityly have a good picture. <br /> <br />After you get this lens, I would consider getting a battery grip.  In my case, I use a Rebel XT and with this lens on, I feel the lens overwhelms the camera body.  I suggest getting a battery grip if you want to get a better grip with this lens. (Note that most lens with zooms usually are big) Check out the battery grip from OPTEKA, it's more than half the price of the Canon one and people are giving it great reviews aswell. <br /> <br />I'll update this review when my battery grip arrives.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|My brother and I are lifelong Star Wars fans, and he called me recently to tell me that the original Star Wars trilogy was coming out on dvd, but they were just transfers of the old laserdiscs and not cleaned up at all.  I was not surprised to hear it.  Why?  Because I realized long ago that George Lucas is simply milking the Star Wars fan base and the franchise for all it's worth.  First the original trilogy was released on VHS.  Then the special edition on VHS.  Then the special edition on DVD.  Then the special edition again on dvd with a few more tweaks, and I've lost count, but I think there was even more releases.  Now we're getting the original version on dvd, but not cleaned up.  Now, look in to your crystal balls..  Any predictions?  I foresee a cleaned up Episode 4-6 box set.  And after that, I expect a super duper \\"may the force be with you\\" 6 movie box set.  How do I know all of this?  I don't.  But just look at the past trend, and it makes sense to assume that this will NOT be the final release of the original trilogy.<br /><br />I tell you one thing, I am not going to buy this cheap 13 year old laserdisc transfer, especially since there will likely be a better release someday.  If the entire set is released and they are ALL cleaned up and episodes 4-6 are the ORIGINAL versions, then I will spend the money.  But until then, I am keeping the versions I already have.  I thought James Cameron was bad enough with his original version of T2, then the T2 version with additional footage, then another version of T2 with MORE additional footage, but that was before all of the releases and rereleases of Star Wars.  Mr. Lucas, you can take your hand out of my pocket now, because I've hidden my wallet from you!!!
B00009V7P8|2.0|There's been quite a bumper-crop of guitar-strumming/finger-picking, breathy-voiced, heart-on-their-sleeves, male singer-songwriters of late, all harkening back in one way or another to the original, Nick Drake.  Damien Rice is, in my estimation, the bost boring of the bunch.  Few things distinguish a song from any other one on the album.  Most have the same tempos, arrangements, and melodic movement intended to be evocative of longing and melancholy.  Even given the high quality of the sound, playing and whatnot, I think this is an awful album.  I sincerely wish that folks would stop comparing Rice to Jeff Buckley.  Jeff Buckley was an absolute genius, a man who could have been his generation's pop-Beethoven, but Damien Rice will be more or less forgotten within three to five years, with only a small core of fans to watch him when he plays small coffeeshops throughout the country, before he moves back to the UK to become a bank manager or something.
0446525537|4.0|It was Landon Carter's last year at Beautfort High, but the beginning to the road of manhood. It was 1958, and Landon, a popular boy, had been dating a few girls here and there, but little did he know he would come across an unexpected love. Jamie Sullivan, the shy daughter of the town minister, always seemed to be living a different life than anyother girl her age and never had a boyfriend. It was an unanticipated fate that lead Jamie and Landon to become partners for the homecoming dance. The dance lead them into a unintended love. Landon being with Jamie would inform him about the many depths of the human heart and would eventually bring him to dramatic decision that would bring him to his manhood! <br />Overall, I loved this book. This romantic story of two completely differenet people with one shard fate brought me to tears and happiness at the same time. Their story of love is unexpected and mysterious. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in for twisted romantic stories.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I was not tuned into the Beck phenomenon when he first broke.  I considered him a generic hack like so many other faceless assembly line musicians that poison the landscape today.<br /><br />  I hearby offer my sincerest apologies to Mr. Hanson.  My nephew, who is a drummer and musician himself (myself, his brother and dad guitarists), played \\"Lost Cause\\" for me and I knew I not listening to the usual \\"alternative\\" crap.<br /><br />  \\"Sea Changes\\" is a breakup album, apparently.  It's deep, mystifying, incredibly rich in its arrangements and mature.  This is a writer who truly is trying to explore his world and expressing himself without the usual cliches, and being very successful doing it.<br /><br />  The aforementioned \\"Lost Cause\\", \\"Already Dead\\", \\"Sunday Sun\\" and my favorite the unbelievably meloncholy \\"Around The Bend\\" tie the CD into a visit with depression, introspection and resignation.  It's one of rock's most honest and hopefully endearing albums in the last several years.  It's good to know there is talent out there under 40 years old.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather by Mario Puzo is one of the best selling novels of all time, but its film adaptation, (1972) directed by the young filmmaker, Francis Coppola, set a new benchmark in epic filmmaking. What set this film apart from its contemporaries was its absolute realism and true depiction of the rise of the Sicilian mob in New York circa early twentieth century. Vito Carleone (Marlon Brando) right at the start of the film in the opening sequence at his daughter's wedding portrayed a man of few words, and the subtle presence of considerable danger.<br /><br />As the undertaker requests the Godfather's help to avenge his daughter's beating, Carleone appears puzzled. He asks, \\"Why do you not ask for my friendship? Why have I not been invited for coffee at your home with your wife? Only now, when you need something, do you come to me? Why is this?\\" These people are no mere thugs. The Sicilian tribal warfare and their absolute `will to power' has been going on for a thousand years. Carleone knew that the undertaker needed his strong arm and influence. But he pulled the undertaker into his world: first demanding respect, then telling the desperate man that when he was needed for a favour, he would be there. Thus the deal was done. He was now part of the family.<br /><br />Godfather Part 1 is a beautiful film and a graphic depiction of violence and the culture of the early American-Sicilian. We see the fall of Vito Carleone and the unexpected rise of his son, Michael, (Al Pacino) as he avenges the attempted assassination of his father. Michael becomes the Godfather and Part 1 brilliantly comes to a close.<br /><br />Most film critics at the time of Part 2's release praised the picture and lauded its acting and skilful storytelling. Part 2 moves from preset time to the past, revealing Vito Carleone's humble beginnings, played with brutal skill by Robert DeNiro. What is interesting is the central motif of the tale is of the son becoming the father -(the fathers sins become the sons) Michael was never meant to do the family business. He was an ethical young man, obeying his father's wish by becoming a lawyer, but joining the army. (Against his wishes) Michael's transformation from an innocent to a cold-blooded Godfather is astounding.<br /><br />Godfather Part 3, though nominated for seven academy awards, was a critical failure. However this writer disagrees, as the story focuses on Michael's success and his reflections about his life. He knew what he had done, including the murder of his own brother, and wanted some kind of redemption. He tries to make everything right, but he finally pays the ultimate price: the closing scenes of the film are one of the most heart wrenching and dramatic in cinematic history. Pacino should have won the Oscar that year, but again they passed him by until many years later.<br /><br />The Godfather Trilogy is a collection of quality filmmaking that should be part of anyone's DVD library because the story continues to resonate and will continue to do so for a long time.ecome the sons) Michael was never meant to do the family business.

B0002EXFNI|4.0|Although the plot for this movie is formulaic, this movie does what few movies do in this genre: Leaves the viewer feeling good about the main characters. Even Kelly, played by Timothy Olyphant as the sleazy porn film producer, is not a bad guy. Oh, and while on the subject, Kelly was the most interesting character in the movie. Not to say that the other characters were boring but Kelly stole the movie. James Remar also did an admirable job as Hugo Posh. All in all a solid movie.
0380778556|5.0|The beginning of Rebecca starts out, with the heroine, who's name we never learn, describing a dream she had about her old estate called Manderley.  Manderley is where she lived with her husband, Maxim de Winter.  Who, years before had married the heroine, and they both moved into Manderley together.  Not long after the heroine moved in, she finds out from Maxim's housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, that she is nothing like Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who had died a few years ago.  The mystery of Rebecca begins to unravel, when a boat is found at the bottom of the cove with Rebecca's body in the boat cabin.<br /><br /> To me, Rebecca started out as more of a romance novel, and turns into a mystery novel towards the middle.  It starts out in the present with the heroine describing her dream about visiting Manderley, but it switches to the past when Maxim de Winter and the heroine first meet at the hotel, Cote d'Azur in Monte Carlo.  When Maxim de Winter explained to the heroine the truth behind the mystery of how Rebecca died, I was shocked.  I had didn't expect that Maxim de Winter would murder his own wife.  However, when Maxim explained to the heroine that he killed his wife, because of having an affair, possibly being pregnant, and for never having a loving or trusting marriage, I thought that his reasons were justified but still wrong.<br /><br /> I would recommend this novel to anyone who loves romance and mystery novels.  Rebecca is thrilling, mysterious, and confusing at some parts, but in the end it all comes together.  I loved reading Rebecca; it's a real page-turner that you never want to stop reading.  Out of the many books that I have read, Rebecca was one of the best books I have ever read in my life.
B00005JOVH|4.0|Amazing is one word to describe as this film but grimy is another. <br />About the goverment coming up with a cure to make mutants become regular people, make mutants feel affended. So the mutants battle it out to stop the cures. And of course the leader of this all is guess who? Magneto of course. WIth different sidekicks, they battle out the good X-Men. SOme get hurt, some turn into regular humans and a lot of them die. <br />Now this one was very different from the first and second. It had more deaths of the main charactors and they trash talked alot in this one. It was a very good movie, but we notice that we loose alot of good charactors in the story, which kind of blows. But for everyone who likes X-Men, you won't be disappointed.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|A beautiful debonair named Holly Golightly leaves her husband and moves into Manhattan with an ambition to meet a wealthy man, marry him, and then name her pet cat, and enjoy the rest of her life. This sounds like an ambition of a typical young woman, but when Holly meets a young writer named Paul Varjak; there is no love at first; but that changes gradually and love blossoms. One would like to think this is a love story, but not quite, the author is not Erich Segal. Truman Capote wrote this short novel about a woman who is in pursuit of a high society life and never finds one; and she never grows up. The movie deviates from Capote's book in several areas. Capote wrote this book with Marilyn Monroe on his mind for the lead role, but the role went to Audrey Hepburn; director Blake Edwards couldn't have made a better choice. This is one of the classic movies of Hepburn in which every member of the audience becomes enchanted and captivated with the beauty and passion of Holly played by Hepburn. This wisp-thin actress, carrying a long cigarette holder is one of the iconic images of American Cinema.<br /><br />In the final part of the movie when Holly was dumped by her rich Brazilian fianc&eacute;e, her friend Paul Varjak helps her recollect; and in a reconciliatory term she changes her heart only to fall in love with Varjak. This scene was shot in the middle of pouring rain in Manhattan that adds a touch of pure romance and a grand finale to the endless pursuit of Holly in search of a rich man. Everyone who loves happy ending would love this; but no one was unhappy than Capote who was upset for the change; he wanted Holly to remain as a mysterious woman who never learns and never gives up her dream. My favorite part of the movie is the film's on-location opening sequence, in which Holly gazes into a Tiffany's display window after getting out from a cab in mid-town Manhattan, while eating a pastry; and of course the scene kissing Varjak in the middle of pouring rain in Manhattan. This movie shows more scenes of streets of Manhattan than any other movie I have seen. I highly recommend listening to the hit song of the American rock group Deep Blue Something's \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" which adds to the enjoyment. Of course the music in the movie is strongly supported by Henry Mancini.<br /><br />Many of us from the days of \\"A Team\\" know George Peppard as a tough talking Colonel Smith. It is a pleasant surprise for many of us to see this DVD and witness the tender side of young Peppard as Paul Varjak. Paul is strong, yet remains as an acquaintance of Holly but gradually he sees the feminine side of Holly, who is vulnerable, yet romantic in her heart. Blake Edwards indicated at one stage that he might not have cast Peppard if he were to do this all over again. We are unsure if there was a problem in their working relationship or Edwards was unhappy with his casting. I for one who was most disappointed to learn that Peppard was not nominated for academy award for his role in this movie. Buddy Ebsen and Mickey Rooney have limited role; yet they delight the audience with their talents and craftsmanship.attan.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|From a musician's standpoint, this double disc album has just about every single unoriginal chord progression out there. It's got Am F C G, Am C G F, C G Am F, C Dm F G, Am G F, and the list goes on. However, the songs are so catchy and the lyrics are so good that they completely overshadow the unoriginality of a large part of the chord progressions. Many songs have the laid-back feel of the songs Scar Tissue, The Zephyr Song, and Otherside, which I prefer over the funked out, super loud feel of songs like Give It Away etc. But if you're into their faster, more funky songs, don't let that dissuade you from getting this album; many songs do have the funky feel of RHCP's earlier days.<br /><br />Every song is melodic, listenable and enjoyable, and the RHCP really show off their use of the 3-way harmony throughout the album. All in all, this is a really awesome double disc album that is sure to produce numerous hits and win over new fans. With the amount of new material on this album, buyers are sure to get more than their money's worth.
6305047529|5.0|For you Danny Kaye fans, well you know all about this anyway.  For those looking for a good family movie, this is it.  Perhaps not Kayes best work, but near the top.  Great screen adaptation of Thurbers short story.  Movie stands alone and is easily identified with by us \\"dreamers\\" out here.  Do recommend a read of the original short story for a more complete understanding of where this character came from and how well Kaye protrays this mild mannered man and brings him to life.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|As far as I'm concerned this musical is a perfect example of style over substance. Don't get me wrong- I'll enjoy a big budget commercial musical as much as the next person but this one just isn't that good.     Idina Menzel got a Tony and a lot of praise for this role. I've yet to figure out why. Her sole point of distinction seems to be the fact that she can sing very loudly. So loudly in fact that it distracts you from the fact that she doesn't have a very pretty voice. In fact I find it downright unpleasant on certain songs.    Kristin Chenowith is the saving grace of this album. Her helium speaking voice can be irritating at times but with a set of pipes like hers it doesn't matter. This role doesn't fully show off her marvelous upper range but she gamely makes Glinda her own and manages to sound good doing it.     As for the songs. They're catchy. That's it. Beyond that not much. Each one seems to be derivitive of a better song from another show. On first listen some of the lyrics are witty. On second listen it's same old same old.     I'm not saying it's not worth a listen. But I don't think it's worth more than one.

B00000260F|4.0|Flash is one of guitar idol Jeff Beck's best selling album, a lot of this buoyed by the great remake of The Impressions' classic \\"People Get Ready,\\" with vocals by Beck's old bandmate Rod Stewart (truly delivering one of his best performances).<br /><br />But the rest of this record is solid and entertaining, including \\"Ambitious,\\" (featuring a particularly nasty Beck solo), \\"Gets Us All In The End,\\" and the Grammy-award winning instrumental \\"Escape.\\"<br /><br />If people buy this expecting to rock out, forget it. But if they want to hear some great guitar solos mixed in with some great vocals, you'll enjoy Flash.

B000F1IQN2|2.0|Most people over the age of 40 remember the terrible events surrounding the killing of the 1972 eleven-member Israeli Olympic team by a group of Palestinian extremists. Their abduction from Munich and ultimate death pulled a shroud over the games. Because of this horrific event, security at subsequent Olympic games has been ratcheted up significantly. But that's not why we're here discussing Steven Spielberg's film. We're here to see why I didn't give it a resounding \\"Thumbs Up\\".<br /><br />Historically MUNICH is interesting. Not only does it show the horrors mankind can inflict upon one another, but it also shows the repercussions of reacting in an equal measure of violence to such an event. When Israel decides to form a death squad and send them out to eliminate the terrorists who dealt the deadly blows to the Israeli Olympians, a message we've heard a million times comes a-smackin' us in the face: evil begets evil.<br /><br />The acting is fairly blas&eacute; with the exception of the main character, Avner (Eric Bana TROY.) In fact, I can't recall a single other memorable person in the film. I remember that there's a bomb-maker, a clean-up man, and a couple of shooters, but that's all I remember of them.<br /><br />The length of the film is extreme. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, nodding off was almost inevitable. Mr. Spielberg is, perhaps, spoiled in that he can do whatever he wants in Hollywood and for as long as he wants (the remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS being a prime example.)<br /><br />I don't mean to belittle the atrocious circumstances surrounding this true story, nor do I mean to invalidate the message Steven Spielberg so desperately wants to get across to us. It's a vital and unfortunate part of human history.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|It's been four years since Red Hot Chili Peppers last put out an album, 2002's \\"By The Way,\\" and how do they follow it up? By releasing a massive twenty-eight song set, compiled in a double-disc package, simply titled \\"Stadium Arcadium.\\" I'll admit, I approached this album with caution. Afterall, I tend to have a short attention span, and sorting through so much music at once seemed to be a challenge. Not so.<br /><br />\\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is full of enough songs to fill a stadium, and each one has something different to offer. For fans who latched onto them in the late 80's -- the funk rock is explored in depth here. For those who fell in love with the hits of the 90's, well, they hit the nail on the head more than a few times. And for those who just love their last two albums, they continue walking down the same golden path. If you don't like this album, then quite simply: You do not like Red Hot Chili Peppers. I could write a long-winded review talking about each song and how good they are. But why bother? There are plenty of other people willing to do that. I think the time it would take me to write such a review would be better put to use by listening to this incredible album. There's a lot to sort through, but it's an easy listen. Each song has something going for it, and each song is just as good as the last. Red Hot Chili Peppers have everything under one umbrella here. I urge everyone who likes music to give this a shot.
B000069AUI|5.0|Using a mixture of styles to infuse life into pop, Coldplay trounced the album competition with the second entry into their album discography.  This album managed to garner three top Grammy awards:  the Best Alternative Music Album of 2002; the Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal of 2002 for the song \\"In My Place;\\" and Record of the Year of 2003 for the single \\"Clocks.\\"  In 2003 \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine listed this album as #473 of the 500 greatest albums of all time.  If Coldplay can translate the success of their first three albums into future albums, their place as icons of rock will be assured.<br /><br />Though the music is fundamentally pop, the topics are often not.  Written shortly after the events of 11 September 2001, \\"Politik\\" calls for understanding and love and asks us to view the reality that we are all one race.  The style of this song is marvelous, mixing elements of grunge and alternative with mellow backing to create an unusual song with tragic undertones.<br /><br />After the relatively heavy opening, \\"In My Place\\" is a soothing pop song.  This song was recognized critically by its Grammy Award.  However, the song fared less well on the charts, reaching only #17 on the U.S. Modern Rock chart.  The song did much better on both the U.K. and Canadian charts, where it reached #2 on both.  The song is mellow and pretty, and easy on the ears; all attributes of a solid pop song.<br /><br />The third song provides a third style in as many songs.  This alternative pop song has a blues flavor to it and a faster beat than the previous two songs.  The lyrics are simple, but the refrain is excellent and worth listening to multiple times.<br /><br />Pop albums have to have a love song on them, usually more than one.  I think there must be a rule about that somewhere.  \\"The Scientist\\" is one of the most interesting love songs I can recall on a pop album.  The lyrics are unusual in that the words try to describe love and relationships analytically rather than emotionally.  These lyrics are great for geeks like me.  This song was a single that reached #18 on the U.S. Modern Rock chart, and did reasonably well in the U.K. and Canada.<br /><br />The fifth song on this album is \\"Clocks,\\" which is a remarkable song that I never tire of hearing.  The song does have elements that seem drawn from the Verve.  However, this song is all Coldplay's, with elements of grunge and pop and rock all nicely executed with lyrics that beg to back an excellent movie about life and futures and pasts and missed opportunities and opportunities yet to be.  Try not to read the lyrics too many times or you may find your life in them.  This song reached #9 on the U.S. Modern Rock chart, making it the most successful single from this album in the U.S.  The people at the Grammy Awards were smarter, bestowing Record of the Year on this song.  It is fortunate that all the music on this album was less than this song, or I might never listen to any other album ever again.<br /><br />I was delighted and surprised by \\"Daylight.\\"  This song has several retro elements that reminded me of the Doors and the Beatles with Verve to pull it all together.  The clever music for this song makes this song my second favorite on this CD.  The words are deliciously surreal and evocative.  Oh, silly me, this is a psychedelic song, a rarity in this era.<br /><br />\\"Green Eyes\\" is another bluesy song that almost has a country flavor.  This song adds a little to this album, but is one of the weaker songs here.  Even though I describe this song as being weaker, it is weak only in comparison to the rest of the music on this CD.<br /><br />The strength of the music comes back with \\"Warning Sign,\\" which I think should have been a single.  This pop ballad is about love and regret.  The song is mellow and melancholy, with excellent string music at just the right points.<br /><br />I am much less enthused about \\"A Whisper,\\" which I believe is the weakest song on this CD.I think portions of the song are too repetitive and sometimes downright annoying.  There are portions of this song that are strongly reminiscent of Sting and the Police, and I like those portions, but three quarters of the \\"whispers\\" could have been eliminated to make a better song.<br /><br />The title track is quite nice.  The song begins with as an acoustic blues song.  The song powers up in two steps to become solidly alternative.  When the reverberation adds in this song becomes very powerful and excellent.  The lyrics are complex and the most challenging of any on this CD.  This song is one of the best executed songs on this CD and one of my favorites.<br /><br />The closing song is \\"Amsterdam.\\"  The song has a Pink Floyd opening, an Elton John transition, and an acoustic alternative body.  The harmony at the halfway point is nicely done, and helps carry the song into the piano bridge, where an organ is the leading edge of a bevy of electric instruments that finally kick in to finish off the album.  This song was a good selection to finish out this album.<br /><br />Coldplay is building a significant track record.  If they can continue with the kind of musical quality they have had thus far, they will be on the edge of being rock superstars, and icon status will follow shortly behind.t song on this CD.

1400032717|5.0|this is one of the funniest book i have ever read.  mark haddon gives us an expedition inside the peculiar mind of a genius.  very well written and highly entertaining.  two thumbs up, way up
1573226521|5.0|This book is so much better than the movie that I don't think they should share the same name. I loved the beginning down on kaosan road in Bangkok and then the whole trip down the islands and this sense of kids looking for paradise, the perfect beach, and  instead finding a version fo hell. This is an important book about an era and time that is rapidly going away. For example, by now, the internet and  e-mail has so changed travelling and the whole rave scene that any spot that's half-fine will be totally out on the web before you've set down your beach towel. Still, it was fun while it lasted.

B000CS45QU|5.0|if you're trying to decide whether to shell out the extra five dollars for the bonus cd, i'd like to convince you that it is worth it.    argument #1 = the tracks on the bonus cd are just as strong as the rest of the cd, not an afterthought.  no crappy remixes to be found here.  argument #2 = if two years ago beth orton put out a cd with five new songs on it for $5, you would have bought it without hesitation.  argument #3 = title track comfort of strangers #9 is particularly good, with a duet with m ward (who co-wrote the song with beth orton).    similar to pass in time, the comfort of strangers bonus disc is quality material, and well worth the extra dollars.
B00000DQSZ|4.0|Of all of Kraftwerk's releases Trans Europe Express is their most accessable album.  It is basically two concept albums in one!  My favorite song is called the hall of mirrors.  The song is about someone who looks in the mirror and doesn't like what they see.  There is a lot of great tracks on this one.  Go check it out if you like Kraftwerk or this kind of music.  You can't go wrong.
0425173739|5.0|I never had read a murder mystery before in my life so when this book was suggested to me I wasn't to excited about reading it. However, in beggining this piece of literature I fell in love with Christie's style of writing and of course that Belgium detective, Hercule Poirot. <br />All of the background characters were great (some hillarious) and I recommend this novel strongly.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Yes was an extremely promising band before this, with a very noteworthy second album (_Time and a Word_).  All of a sudden they made this album that displayed a kind of brilliance almost unprecedented to rock, with the sole exception of ELP's first album.  But Yes were never any ELP wanna-be; _The Yes Album_ presents them as absolutely their own band and stands near the pinnacle of their staggering achievements with the releases that came right after: _Fragile_, _Close to the Edge_, and _Relayer_.<br /><br />This quantum leap has everything to do with Steve Howe replacing the very-capable-but-nowhere-near-as-pyrotechnic Peter Banks on lead guitar.  It also has everything to do with Jon Anderson finding a laser focus (albeit one directed to the clouds) as a lyricist, singer, and bandleader, which in turn put the band right in the lush and expansive pocket that they needed to be in.  When one listens closely to _Time and a Word_ so many of the elements are there: Chris Squire's gut-rumbling and nimble bass (is it he or John Entwistle who is rock's first true lead bassist?), Bill Bruford's phenomenally loose/tight drum rolls and fills played polyrhythmically with the other parts of the kit, Tony Kaye's exultant keyboards . . . and an enchanting lead singer named Jon Anderson singing songs about love and outer space always singing near the top of his range.  Yet even the best songs on _Time and a Word_, like the thrilling title track, don't really hold a candle to something like \\"Yours Is No Disgrace.\\"  Going by the rest of the vocal and songwriting highlights on _The Yes Album_ (all of it), I believe that this has everything to do with the fact that Anderson got away from flower-power anthems and just decided to make little to no sense with the words he wrote.  Yes, \\"Starship Trooper\\" is about something, namely a starship trooper and some universal love/zen thing that he peals ecstatically to an incorporeal being, but it's really not about anything in particular other than delicious and consciousness-expanding sound and sentiment.  No \\"There's a word/ and the word is love/ and it's right for me\\" here (\\"Time and a Word\\")!  Lovely, but a little too direct.  Try the lyrics to \\"Starship Trooper\\" on for a change:<br /><br />Sister Bluebird flying high above,<br /><br />Shine your wings forward to the sun.<br /><br />Hide the myst'ries of life on your way.<br /><br />Though you've seen them, please don't say a word.<br /><br />What you don't know, I have never heard.<br /><br />Like I said, this is about something, but it's more in the vein of ecstatic lyric poetry, like Rumi or other more abstract poets.  The band responds with more inspired playing than anything on albums preceding, not simply jamming, like on \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (great song!--again _Time and a Word_), but creating a polyphony that seems classical, jazzy, and rocking all at once.  This combination is something they shot for on _Time and a Word_ but didn't quite obtain.  Well, thank god they kept on trying for it, because they achieved it here and the history of rock was never the same.<br /><br />I've only mentioned a few songs on here, as many of them are familiar to listeners of their best-of packages.  Two songs that aren't as anthologized as the others are Steve Howe's swoon-inducing classical/country solo piece \\"The Clap\\" and the remarkably enduring \\"Perpetual Change,\\" which doesn't appear on the ubiquitous _Classic Yes_.

B00005JOVN|5.0|This movie was very very good.I saw the original and that was so good that i had to see the new one.They were both very good.I saw this movie twice.I saw it once with my friend and she kept telling me she would hate it and then the whole movie she was asking me what would happen next and at the end she said it was the best movie.It is a very tense movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.The second time i saw it was with my mom at the IMAX.I reccomend seeing it on the IMAX if you have one near you because you feel like you are really in the movie.My mom was very impressed with the movie because before she saw it she heard from the critics it was bad but I told her it was an excellant movie so she gave in to see it and loved it as well.The special effects in the movie are amazing and will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time.If you like Titanic you will love this too!So go and see this movie and hopefully you will love it like I did.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|Nonetheless, it's a good watch.  What makes the film for me is the fact that the lead actor is excellent, even when he's spending ten minutes of screen time just developing film.  The film is un-selfconsciously arty, if such a thing is possible.  That works in the sense that the camera angles are always interesting and every shot is fun to look at. On the other hand, there's some stuff that makes little sense. The movie is bookended by mimes, and even the film historian on the commentary track seemed to have little idea what their point is.  Also, while the film was undoubtedly daring when it came out in 1966,  the scenes of debauchery are quaint and almost comical today. The datedness makes the film a good cultural artifact of its time.    If you can accept the film's glacial pacing on its own terms, the superb cinematography and surreal aspects of the movie are rather hypnotic, making this a memorable viewing experience.
B00003CXB4|5.0|How can anyone have something against \\"The Lion King?\\" The opening is dynamic, the story powerful, no matter what the source, and some of the best Disney Songs ever written.

0618526412|5.0|It took me a long time to read this. It wasn't a book where one thing leads to the next in a single plot that you follow from page to page. The plot is more like a spiral that circles through five main characters in various states of poverty in a small Southern town. The owner of an all night diner, slave to nickles and daily routine. The black doctor, powerless to inspire his neighbors to follow his ideas about birth control or politics. The teenage girl whose family runs a boarding house, dirt poor, ignorant, and an unnoticed musical prodigy. The deaf/mute jeweler who has no one to speak sign language with. The labor agitator, frustrated to violence by the circumstances of those he sees around him. The book goes around and around through the lives of these, people, following them for one year. For all of them, in this year, bad goes to worse. There is uniform decay, devastation, disappointment... it is a bleak bleak landscape that only gets more grim as the book goes on.<br /><br />It's written brilliantly. There are lines in the description of the people specifically, of the milieu in general, of the zeitgeist, that are just exquisite perfection. Descriptions I will remember and take away with me, into other books, into my understanding of the South during the depression. Her handling of the point of view shifts, around the town, and how the different characters' worldviews are reflected in the quality and nature of the narrative... it's nothing short of genius. I can't even think of a crack to make about this book, because it was so completely shatteringly good.<br /><br />Nothing I ever want to read again. I could get the same sensation of hopelessness, ignorance, waste, and want by... wait... WHY would I want to relive that sensation? Why don't I just go put my head against the sidewalk and flatten it with a sledge hammer?<br /><br />It's a book that I should have read, and I'm glad I did, and I'm glad it was written, but now I want to eat strawberry ice cream, and read P.G. Wodehouse, and kiss my kids.ice cream, and read P.G. Wodehouse, and kiss my kids.  <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This album is truly an amazing accomplishment by dream theatre. but then.. when aren't Dream Theatre albums amazing? First let me say: to those looking for head banging death metal.. look else where! Dream Theatre is a melodic progressive type of alternative to metal band. They have incredibly diverse song arangements, ranging from piano and acoustic guitar to pounding metal riffs. This album is probably one of their heavier albums. I reccomend this to anyone who likes Dream Theatre, further more I reccoment to those who are fans of bands such as: Yngwie Malmsteen, late Metallica, Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, etc... As I said Dream Theatre is an incredibly diverse yet extremely talented group. At the very least there should be at least one song you like.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|I watched this movie with the family and found it only mildly entertaining.  Certainly the imagry was wonderful, yet, the story was only okay from my perspective.  Sadly, \\"just okay\\" is not something that I ever expect from the talented duo of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.<br /><br />I must confess also that the oompla loompa was pretty creepy and distracted me from the story.<br /><br />A bigger indicator for me {and parents looking for a good family movie} was the overall lack of appreciation and interest from my kids.<br /><br />I give this movie a three stars vote out of respect for Burton and Depp and the effort they put forth, but I think the true mark lies somewhere between two and three stars.

B00000K3D4|5.0|I fell in love with this movie when it came out 20 years ago. To me, it's the classic struggle between good and evil that can only be resolved when Sarah realizes Evil-embodied in David Bowie's character \\"has no power over me.\\"  <br /> <br />Believe it or not, I use snippets from this movie in my graduate seminar on policy analysis. Since policy analysis spends a lot of time discussing equity, equality and fairness and how to measure those concepts--the \\"that's not fair\\" lines ring true with my students. <br /> <br />Beyond these things..the costumes and puppetry are amazing. Even after 20 years, this movie doesn't look dated. That's saying a lot given David Bowie's big 80s hair. Watching it last night, my husband and I discussed whether or not the scene with the Chillys was the first attempt at blue-screen technology. That scene is a little rough around the edges but it could have very well been the start of ILM.  <br /> <br />Finally, for those of you that are fans of the British TV series Red Dwarf, Danny John-Jules (Cat) voices two of the Chillys.

Hell, even the singer makes me think of good ol' Jello. I'm not a big fan of radio suppourt but this band diserves it. Some of the best lyrics in mainstream rock. <br /> <br />Thumbs up
1594200106|4.0|This is perhaps the most entertaining book I have read in the past year, and far exceeds the spectacularly disappointing The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova. The characters are interesting and gain our empathy and the dialogue is at times as witty as I have ever read. I laughed and smiled my way through much of the book. The central conceit of the story is its greatest triumph. It is a wonderfully intriguing narrative that has as its foundation the love and magic of books. But, the book is not without its shortcomings and this is where it loses its fifth star.<br /><br />The major shortcoming comes at the end where the narrative of an exceedingly long (though not unexpectedly well written) letter penned by a character who meets an untimely demise is used to explain the entire mystery. After the protagonist, Daniel, sleuths his way through the book finding all the pieces of the puzzle it is all conveniently put together for him just like that. I think that if he were allowed to figure it out in larger part on his own it would have had more impact for the reader. And, because it is all related by a single individual in what amounts to a giant flashback (and there are several of these earlier in the book) the the book lacks any real emotional buildup to the final denouement that follows immediately afterward. The ending just seems to suddenly happen. On top of this, at the very end the author conveniently provides an \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\" postscript that was entirely unnecessary and really not worthy of the rest of the book. For a story of such wonderfully intricate complexity in which the theme of lost love played such a major role such a neat ending was ill-conceived. This left me feeling a bit disappointed.<br /><br />However, that said, the book as a whole was a terrific read and I recommend it heartily. The character of Fermin in particular was a treasure. I can't help but think that everyone who reads this book will wish they had their own Fermin in their lives. The book is worth reading for his dialogue alone.rmin in their lives.

The big one for me, was at the end of the film when Nyah is infected. Her symptoms are nowhere near as bad as the scientist at the beginning of the film. She's concious, there is no blood loss, & she just seems to be stumbling around like a drunk (yeah, she looks infected to me & I totally f**king bought it).<br /><br />This is Tom Cruise's vanity project. I know between takes somebody had a mirror in front of him, making sure somebody loved him.<br /><br />Dougray Scott was originally offered the role of Wolverine in \\"The X-Men\\", but, due to over shooting on this film he had no choice but to pass on the role. Enter Hugh Jackman. Snikt! Exit Dougray Scott's career.<br /><br />The action is a bit much in this film & is the absolute big drawback to \\"M:I 2\\". A few action sequences mirror too much of past Woo films.<br /><br />The motorcycle chase reminded a little bit of \\"Hard Target\\" & when Hunt & Ambrose do the chest bump off the motorcycle's it reminded of a similar sequence from \\"Face/Off\\".<br /><br />\\"M:I 2\\" is a decent film, that I expected much more out of both Tom Cruise & John Woo, & if it self destructs in five seconds, I won't lose sleep over it.uch in this film & is the absolute big drawback to \\"M:I 2\\".

B000AU9UYM|5.0|I am so, so embarassed that I did not see this movie in the theater.  Even though the X-Men films are solid and Sin City was spot-on perfect, I had given up on Batman movies after three stinkers in a row.  But this was movie was superb in every conceivable way.  This movie not only honors the comic book, it also succeeds as a movie independent of the comic.  Even my wife, who did NOT want to watch this movie, absolutely loved it.  Every choice the filmmakers made was right, but none more so than casting Christian Bale.  He absolutely nails the character.  He is the first actor to play Bruce Wayne as the playboy he's supposed to be, something that makes the contrast of his deeply pissed off and angry Batman that much darker, just as he should be.  Christopher Nolan, or whoever was in charge, made sure every single person involved in the project was on the same page, and the effect is superb.  This movie actually stayed with me for days.  I didn't learn any life lessons, but it had been a long time since I'd seen a big Hollywood movie this finely layered and nuanced--the explanations of his armor, his batmobile, and how, in the future, Batman's batcave came to be filled with expensive gadgetry, are all offered with a wonderful plausibility.  There's a palpable feeling as one watches it that all the players on the project really wanted to kick some ass, and they succeeded masterfully.  I think I may actually buy this movie, something I never do since, come on, how often do people really watch movies from their DVD collection?

0895260131|3.0|I'm a staunch proponent for the War On Terror and the expose of Islamic bigotry and imperialism. Yet, I myself am not too impressed with this book or people like Robert Spencer or the Israeli Bat Y'eor. Both obviously seem to have rabid pro-Israel agendas and hope to incite anti-Muslim bigotry in Americans and manipulate Evangelical Christians yearnings for the Apocalypse. <br />However, I can stomach them much more than squirmy apologists who wish to paint the history of Islam as all water & roses (Muslim outlaw wine you know, they prefer to drink it in dark corners, in secret much like our junkies shoot up heroin). <br />first off, you mention muslim presence in Spain and southern Italy. How did the muslim religion flourish in those lands? Through conquest  and also from many of the natives seeing conversion as a better and easier path through life. Dhimmi (Christian/Jewish/Zoroastrian natives) were tolerated, nerver given equal footing in Muslim governed lands. they were always at the mercies of their Muslim overlords. You mentioned Muslims in Eastern Europe. Have you a clue as to what the Turks did to the peoples of those lands? Do you not realize that to this day, Greeks go cold at the mention of \\"the Turk?\\" You also mention the Copts of Egypt. Are you aware that the Copts are treated as second class citizens in their own country? They cannot build a church higher than any mosque. They are not allowed to proselytize any Muslims (Certainly NOT vice versa). A Coptic man is forbidden from marrying a Muslim Arab woman (of course Muslim men can partake of all the Christian female flesh they desire). There have been antichristian riots in Egypt against the Copts and killings.  <br />You also mention a pseudo-scholar and shameless apologist for all things Muslim like Karen Armstrong as an alternative and more balanced viewpoint. What world are you existing on, baecause it certainly isn't mine?  <br />People such as yourself and Karen Armstrong and Esposito  and all ofthe rest of the people in this country who will ignore just what went down in Toronto, Cananda, or the riots across the world over caroons just, or the bombings in London and Spain as well as they've forgotten two of the tallest buildings in my city being destroyed and thousands of American lives wasted so they could run back to enjoying their sports and reality shows and fantasize about Paris Hilton or whatnot better wake up to the fact that there is a well organized and well funded element in the Islamic faith which wants to destroy everything we stand for in this country. More often than not, the liberals and socalled \\"progressives\\" in this country will have more to lose than even I and others like me. Really think about that Mr. And Mrs. Progressive and stop biting the hands that feed you and keep you safe (i.e. the American military) in this country you often so much love to mock and hold in contempt.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this CD!! It has such great feeling and I can relate to the music soo much. It's def one of my all time fav Cd's. AVril Lavigne has such talent and she writes awesome songs.    Losing Grip- It's a great song (i like the way it starts off) with plenty of guitar and I love singing along to it. It's about how this guy doesn't really care about her and how he wasn't there for her when she needed him.  One of my fav lyrics: Am I just some chick you place beside you to take somebody's place,when you turn around can you recognize my face    Complicated-This is an awesome song with a great beat. It's about being yourself and not following the croud.  One of My fav lyrics:Why you have to go and make things so complicated? I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated    Sk8er boi-You gotta luv this song,i sing along and rock out to this song all the time. It never grows old. This song's about how this skater boy liked this girl who turns him down cuz she and all her friends think that she's too good 4 him. But later she starts to regret her choice. An allround great song!!  One of my fav lyrics:  Too bad that you couldn't see,See the man that boy could be,There is more that meets the eye I see the soul that is inside    I'm With You- A much slower song than the rest but still just as good. It's about feeling out of place and not knowing where u fit in and \\"tryin to figure out this life.\\" A song that everyone can probably relate too.  One of my fav lyrics:oh why is everything so confusing  maybe I'm just out of my mind    Mobile- An upbeat song thats about how things in life change and how sometimes you just wanna get up and find adventure.  One of my fav lyrics: Hanging from the ceiling lifes a mobile spinning round with mixed feelings crazy & wild ...sometimes I wanna scream outloud ....    Unwanted- A very loud more hard rockish song. I love it cuz, like all the rest of her songs, you can really sence the feeling in it. In this song u canfeel the anger and hurt. It's about being ignored and shut out.  One of my fav lyrics:  You don't know me Don't ignore me You don't want me there You just shut me out    Tomorrow- Another much slower song and it acts like a wind down after the loud angry song that came before it. This song is full of feeling. It's kinda hard not to like this song unless u just hate slow, non-upbeat songs. It's about making hard decisions and that tomorrows always another day.  One of my fav lyrics: Gimme a little time,Leave me alone a little while,Maybe it's not too late,    Anything but Ordanairy- I abseloutly luv the way this song starts out. It's so peaceful and just reminds me of days sitting on the beach watching the waves. This songs about living life to its fullest and being unique.  One of my fav lyrics: Let down your defences Use no common sense  If you look you will see that this world is a beautiful accident turbulent suculent opulent permanent, no way I wanna taste it  Don't wanna waste it away    Things I'll Never Say- This is a great song with lyrics I can really relate too. It's about how you have so many things u wanna say but u keep them locked away.  One of my fav lyrics: I'm tugging at my hair I'm pulling at my clothes I'm trying to keep my cool I know it shows I'm staring at my feet My checks are turning red I'm searching for the words inside my head    My World- This song's about Avril's home town and how life wuz like 4 Avril. It's a great song and sometimes makes me laugh.  One of my fav lyrics: Never wore cover-up,Always beat the boys up    Nobodys Fool-This is an awesome song that starts off with Avril talking, or rapping, the lyrics. But this doesn't make the song any worse than the rest at all. The lyrics are awesome and i luv the way she talks the song. The song says that u can't change me wheather u like me or not and that if u have a problem with me say it too my face.  One of My fav lyrics:  But I fear That you're only telling me what I wanna hear Butdo you give a damn Understand That I can't not be what I am      Too Much To Ask- This song has kinda the same theme as Complicated. It's about how this guy thinks hes better than everyone else and finds himself so tough. It's a good song thats not really upbeat but not super slow. At first I wasn't a big fan of this song but it grows on you.  One of my fav lyrics: Its the first time I ever felt this lonely  I wish someone could cure this pain    Naked- i love this song so much!! It's starts off great with a guitar and than the voice comes right in. The lyrics are so meaningful and deep. The song explains what it's like when u feel like this person knows your every seceret and can see right through you. And how when you are around him \\"the walls just dissapear.\\"  One of my fav lyrics: But then you came around me  The walls just disappeared    This CD is so worth the money and a MUST HEAR!! If you like rock/pop or punk rock u should definetley check ou this CD. And even if your not into that music try this album anyways because it has such meaningful lyrics.
B000056VJ7|4.0|For a lot of us, this album hit at just the right time.  For me, in 1978, I was on the verge of entering high school.  Yes, the songs are dramatic and over-the-top at times but it summed up a lot of the tumultuous feelings of a youth on the verge of discovering dating and love.  For a generation, it was a coming of age album - much like Nirvana's debut disk was for the youth of the 90's.

B00005JP4U|5.0|It's easy to think that \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" can't be reviewed without expressing biased political views. It is, after all, a film that speaks to those who care for the environment, something that's been subject to notoriously liberal causes. For some, the fact that former Vice President Al Gore hosts it will be enough to dismiss the film as nothing more than liberal propaganda. But the way I see it, a documentary about the reality of global warming is not at all part of a political agenda. How can it be when the facts and figures have been known and fought over for years? I think this film is about reintroducing the facts to the public, which in turn leaves deciding on the next course of action up to them. I found this to be a wise move on the filmmakers' part: it holds us responsible while at the same time invites us to be part of the solution.     It seems that with the preceding paragraph, I've cornered myself into a biased mode of thinking. I guess Tom Hanks was right in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\": it all boils down to what you believe. Think whatever you will of me, but I do believe the environment is currently in a very real situation. I also believe that if we don't do something about it soon, humanity is going to suffer the consequences in the not too distant future. Of course, what I believe is still only an opinion, something everyone is entitled to. If the issues discussed in this film do not coincide with your opinions, and if you don't believe we're facing immanent danger, then it's probably best you avoid this movie (despite the incredibly important message it's giving).     But if you're willing to take on a different viewpoint--or at the very least willing to listen to a different viewpoint--then I think seeing this film will be an invaluable experience for you. A majority of the film shows segments from a lecture given by Al Gore, one he had been fine-tuning for years. He gets the audience's attention by opening with \\"Earthrise,\\" a photo of a half-shadowed Earth taken in 1968 from a traveling space probe (famous for being the first of its kind). In that one picture, we get a distinct impression of how certain geographical features were standing the test of time; glaciers and lakes were of a definite size, and shorelines were seemingly set in place. As the lecture progresses, Gore presents more recent photos, ones that show these features changing. Glaciers are not as vast as they used to be and lakes are evaporating.      But that's only the beginning. Apparently, the ten warmest years in history occurred within the last fourteen years, allowing for some unexpected behavior in weather patterns. In 2005, for example, the southern half of South America--an area known for having cooler waters--had its first hurricane. This statistic acts as a counterpart to the devastating Hurricane Katrina, which started out at Category One strength but increased to a Category Five as it passed over the unusually warm Gulf of Mexico. I think the most disturbing information pertained to the polar ice caps (Antarctica and the North Pole). Scientists took core samples and found that carbon dioxide levels are incredibly high, higher than they've ever been. This partially accounts for their gradual melting (more and more frequently, large chunks of ice break off their shelves and crash into the ocean). If they completely melt (which just might happen), the ocean level will rise twenty feet, flooding such heavily populated areas as Shanghai, Calcutta, and New York City.     Weaving in and out of the lecture scenes are moments of personal reflection for Gore. He discusses the year in which his son was hit by a car. He looks back at his upbringing on a tobacco farm and how it contributed to his sister's lung cancer and eventual death. He even reminisces about the 2000 presidential election and his controversial defeat. At first I had trouble making the connection between these moments and the issue of global warming. But as the film progressed, it became clear that he was trying to make sense of his life, attempting to show what ultimately shaped him into the environmentally conscious person he is today. I see him as someone who passionately acts upon something he believes in rather than passively supporting it. At one point, he says that people often shift from ignorance to despair without stopping in the middle to do anything about their problem.    It seems he decided to do his part by making the public aware of what many believe to be an important issue. But he didn't go into it blindly; he did plenty of research, gathering information from very reputable sources. In essence, that period had him behaving like a scientist, trying to prove a point through observation and the meticulous compilation of scientifically proven facts. He ultimately presented this information to an audience of environmentally conscious people, all the while showing animations and overhead projections to accentuate specific ideas. Granted, his style is less than charismatic, but facts outweigh style any day of the week. Besides, he's not above providing a few moments of comedy relief; he includes a very entertaining Matt Groening cartoon that humorously yet truthfully explains the global warming process.    Suggestions for ways to improve the environment are mixed in with the end credits. One of them was to see \\"An Inconvenient Truth.\\" True enough, I believe it's giving a message everyone needs to hear. However, it's not something I can push people into seeing. I can only recommend. In this case, I'm giving a very strong recommendation, maybe one of the strongest I've ever given. While you may not agree with Al Gore or the issue of global warming in general, it's too important a film to be overlooked.     Having just said that, I realize that I don't know how many of you are reading this, nor do I know how many of you I've managed to alienate. But I do know this: sometimes we're given a wakeup call, and if we're particularly receptive, it'll change us for the better. This film may be one of the biggest wakeup calls humanity will ever get. For once, let's be receptive.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Before it was released, Joe Wright's adaptation of Jane Austen's novel seemed destined for failure.  After all, a \\"definitive\\" BBC version starring Colin Firth already existed, with a stellar cast and a faithfulness to Austen that purists adored.  This newest entry, however, is every bit as compelling as its BBC relative.  Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet is brilliant; her Elizabeth is keenly intelligent, witty, spunky, and, above all, utterly charming.  While the BBC version may be known as the \\"Colin Firth version\\" for that actor's memorable performance as Darcy, this one will be known as the \\"Keira Knightley version,\\" as the emphasis here is firmly on Elizabeth, exactly what Austen would have intended.  Of course, Knightley is surrounded by excellent actors such as Mathew Macfayden (Darcy), Judi Dench (Lady Catherine), and Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet), but her outstanding performance is responsible for this film's success.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the plot:  the Bennet family lives in a precarious situation.  With no male heirs and a household of five unmarried daughters, their future is uncertain, as the house will be inherited by the family toad, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.  As in most Austen novels, the mother sets about frantically trying to match up her girls with men of social standing and wealth to ensure that they will all be cared for.  When repressed aristocrat Darcy and his foppish but eligible friend Bingley arrive in the country, Mrs. Bennet starts scheming.  In keeping with the theme, the truth of matters are often obscured by the \\"pride and prejudice\\" of the characters, lending complexity to the plot.<br /><br />Probably the most amazing accomplishment in this film is the transformation of Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship.  Macfayden is cold, judgmental, repressed, and glowering--and yet by the end of the film, without significant change in his countenance, his Darcy seems perfect for Knightley's radiant Elizabeth.  Likewise, Elizabeth's gradual appreciation of Darcy is completely believable, although unfortunately the film suggests that his wealth first turns her head.  Much of what transpires between these characters is expertly shown through the actors' eyes and small gestures, which then makes it equally believable that no one else suspects their growing affection for each other.<br /><br />This adaptation, while not entirely faithful to the novel, captures the spirit of Austen's masterpiece.  The cinematography is as accomplished as the performances, giving the film a vibrancy that puts aside any question of pretension.  The only sour note comes in the last moments of the film when Wright and screenwriter Moggach opt for sappiness over the unsentimental beauty of the rest.  This misstep can be forgiven, given the utter brilliance of everything that comes before it.  Highly recommended, even for those who would not ordinarily sit through a literary adaptation..

Each boy must maintain a continuous four mile per hour pace, or receive a warning. After receiving three such warnings within a three-hour period, a walker who again falls below the required speed is eliminated from the contest by being mercilessly gunned down by the armed guards overseeing the event from halftracks. The event is run by a character known only as \\"The Major\\", who is the lead overseer of the Long Walk. He may (or may not) be a high ranking official in the United States.<br /><br />Watchers tend not to view The Long Walk for the winner - they enjoy seeing those that fail.<br /><br />There are no stops, no rest periods, and no set finish line during a Long Walk. The race ends when only one \\"Long Walker\\" remains, who earns the ultimate grand prize: anything he wants for the rest of his life. It is interesting to note that many winners of the Long Walk have died soon after the race - not because of any foul play, but because of the mental and biological stresses of the race itself. There have been contestants who actually tried to crawl at 4 mph in order to survive after their legs have given out.<br /><br />Each year's contest results in one winner and ninety-nine dead losers. The Walk begins every year at the Maine-Canada border and continues down the east coast of the US until the winner is found. The story mentions that it's a rare event for the Walk to finish outside Maine.<br /><br />The victor of this season's Long Walk is main character Ray Garraty, a 16 year old boy. Having made many friends during the Walk (and watching them all, in turn, die), Ray experiences a nervous breakdown when Stebbins (the illegitimate son of The Major) dies. Ray believes he sees a \\"dark figure\\" beckoning to him in the distance. Believing that he is not done with the Walk (because there is another person walking in front of him), Ray ignores both the cheering crowd and The Major himself.<br /><br />The next time Ray feels The Major's hand on his shoulder, the novel's final line informs us that Ray found the energy to run towards the dark figure ahead of him.<br /><br />The ending has been a source of confusion for many people. The most commonly accepted interpretation is that Ray has either gone completely insane, or that he was moments away from death, or some mixture of the two. Some people believe that he is merely about to faint.<br /><br />What makes the novel rather gruesome (and gripping storytelling) is King's exploration of the slow-paced race to the death. He relishes the walkers' psychological breakdown with great detail, as they push themselves to the limit of human endurance and test their will to live.<br /><br />The story delves into several themes, particularly the survival mentality, and mental and physical exhaustion. The Hands on a Hardbody contest held annually in Texas (and the movie by the same name) explore similar ideas.<br /><br />On a deeper level, it has been suggested that the storyline is a metaphor for life itself, replete with all of its trials and tribulations. Every participant in the walk either continues to walk, or dies (reminiscent of the phrase, \\"It sucks to grow old, but it beats the alternative\\"). Like life, every participant finds different reasons to endure what the walk has to offer. And like life, some just give up and allow themselves to be shot (an equivalent of suicide). And like life, it is only the promise of a better life down the road that propels the participants forward.<br /><br />enjoy...Nigelone with the Walk (because there is another person walking in front of him), Ray ignores both the cheering crowd and The Major himself.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off, I haven't seen the Firefly series and even after the movie Serenity came out, I ignored it. However, due to the repeated recommendations of Amazon, I decided to check it out at my local store. And boy, I didn't realize what I was missing! <br /> <br />If you're a Star Wars fan, partial to \\"weird west\\" cartoons like Trigun, Bravestarr and the more recent Gun X Sword and lapped up the PC game Privateer a decade ago, Firefly is a must-see TV. It also echoes the venerable Star Trek franchise, with the crew dropped in (mostly illegal) situations during their voyages. However, Firefly transcends them all with its witty characterizations, uncontrived plot twists, brisk pacing and all around energy. <br /> <br />I would not go into the plots since it's mostly covered by the editorial and customer reviews. But one thing I noticed about the Firefly series is its refreshing lack of space battles. In fact, the ship Serenity itself has no guns and that is a major \\"twist\\" in space-based TV shows.  <br /> <br />The show hits all the geek notes in the right way. From a roguish crew, evil corporations, criminal lowlifes, and even lesbian kissing. It's almost like Han Solo: The Series, but better. <br /> <br />The DVD set itself is way, way excellent. Aside from humorous and enlightening commentaries from Joss Whedon, it features the aforementioned final three episodes, deleted scenes and a gag reel. One caveat though for parents. Firefly contains sex scenes (you cannot label it \\"suggested sex scenes\\" since you can see them doing it clearly - there's no other way you can interpret it otherwise - hey I'm not complaining! :)) and other scenes of sensitive nature. The violence part, is surprisingly tame for my standards (even the torture scenes) but there is a substantial chunk in the series. <br /> <br />Overall, after seeing the series, you will wonder what were the Fox executives thinking when they cancelled an excellent series like Firefly. Good thing, there's DVD (and movie franchises) to make up for capriciousness and ignorance of network executives.

Barton George Dawes, grieving over the death of his son and the disintegration of his marriage, is driven off the deep end when he finds that both his home and his business are going to be condemned to make way for the construction of a new interstate highway.<br /><br />In the introduction to the novel in the collection The Bachman Books King states his disappointment with the work and that a lot of the novel's seemingly melodramatic touches were attempts by him to come to terms with his own mother's death around the time of writing. King states that he was in two minds about reprinting it but decided to in the end in order to give readers an insight into his personality at the time.<br /><br />Oddly enough, in the introduction to the second edition of The Bachman Books (entitled \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\") King referred to Roadwork as his favorite among the Bachman books.<br /><br />In the introduction to the first collected works The Backman Books, King states in his essay \\"Why I Was Bachman\\", \\"I think it was an effort to make some sense of my mother's painful death the year before - a lingering cancer had taken her off inch by painful inch. Following this death I was left both grieving and shaken by the apparent senselessness of it all...

B000FFJ85I|5.0|This new album is awesome! It has all the qualities an AFI album should have, but tweaked a little.  It's not quite in the same class as Sing the Sorrow, that one was a masterpiece IMO, but it's still great. There's not a song that I don't enjoy.  The band has definitely changed, but change is good!  The album rocks hard yet still has those slower, beautiful moments.  This will be played in my car and on my iPod non-stop for quite a while. Thanks guys for another great album!!
0375831002|5.0|The book, which I can't even remember where I read the original raves about it, should be required reading for every school in the country. As a knock your socks off companion piece to 'The Diary of Anne Frank', '...Thief' captures the German side of the war through the story of a young girl being raised by foster parents who end up hiding a Jewish man in their basement. The catch, or the device if you will, is that the compelling, and nearly not depressing (considering the subject) story is told by death himself. This is the book to read in those book clubs after you've all been looking for something like 'The Kite Runner'. It's human, personal, and wonderfully written, and hopefully won't get lost on the shelves of young adult fiction. This is something everyone should be reading.
B000EYK4KI|3.0|UNLESS this \\"Unrated\\" edition shows little Shiloh Nouvel actually being conceived, I HIGHLY doubt it deserves the label unrated.  Maybe \\"Deluxe Edition\\" or \\"Special Edition\\" would be more accurate.  I am really tired of these unrated edition DVDs having VERY little extra violence (IF any) and almost no extra nudity, two of the main subjects that often cause the MPAA to give a movie an \\"Unrated\\" rating.  Just to use an example, if the filmmakers had decided that Showgirls would play much better with a PG-13 rating, so they made the necessary cuts and then when releasing it on DVD did a PG-13 and an Unrated version, THAT would be different.  How about more truth in advertising and less taking advantage of the customer?
B0006399FS|3.0|I'm a huge U2 fan, going back 20 years with them, but I was mildly disappointed by this record.  Feeling I owed the band the benefit of the doubt, I gave HTDAAB some playing time to \\"grow\\" on me.  Sadly, at the end of the day it's just atmospheric and not very engaging.  And just eleven songs?  After four years?  Now, contrast this creative output with that of Red Hot Chili Peppers, another band outta the 80s who typically see four years go by between records.  \\"By the Way\\" was an artistic high point for that band, but with the release of the 2CD \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" they've gone even further.  SA features 28 new tracks, almost three times as many as HTDAAB, and there are very few songs that could be called \\"filler\\" even by detractors of the band.  In short, RHCP continue their creative streak, their new music demonstrating how inspired they are.  They funk, they rock, they dabble in some engaging mood music, whereas Bono and the boys'last effort is a pretentiously-titled experiment in emoscape, one you won't be coming back to very often, if at all.  Get \\"Stadium Arcadium.\\"
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|Deeply moving.  A delicately, beautifully written tale.  A touching account of a family that nearly unravels in the hands of tragedy.  How the ebb and flow of what was and what can be is just out of their reach.  This book offers a unique and hopeful perspetive of what life is like after life ends on earth.
B000089RVX|5.0|After buying Fallen, I had the privilege of seeing Evanescence in concert (with Default).  This group definitely delivers the goods!  Amy Lee has had classical training, and her powerful voice is like an angel (NOT dark or melancholy like some people think she is \\"supposed\\" to be).  She (and the rest of the band) are full of energy and her songwriting is some of the best.    If I am ever afforded the opportunity to see Evanescence in concert again, I will be there in the blink of an eye!  She is one of the best female lead vocalists in a VERY long time (I'm a Heart fan...quite a change in vocals).  I plan to buy their next CD in October as well and hope that many people get the opportunity to hear them.  Also, be on the lookout for Lacey Mosley as she is the next \\"rock angel\\" as well as the lead singer for Flyleaf.  Both women are extremely talented and worth listening to.
B000EULJLU|2.0|First off, I've loved the music that tool has done in the past, but I find this CD a dissapointment. I've listed to it about 2 weeks to see if my opinion would change. But sadly it has not.    This cd just seems to suffer from too much filler. Lyrics that are not very well thought out and dont flow well with the music. Lyrics that seem mumbled, slured, difficult or impossible to understand. Even the music seems to suffer a mumbleing and sluring of sorts. There dosnt seem to be one song that escapes this effect.    The music and lyrics go though sections of good then bad and back agian. There are some very good sections of the CD. But overall its like there was just a lack of effort or that the CD was rushed. It could have been a very good CD, but it just misses the mark.    I expected better. mabey thats the problem.
B000EGCITG|3.0|I have mixed feelings over this cd, i really like pink but this album could of been better. <br />Tracks like the hilarious 'Stupid Girls', the incredibly funky 'Cuz I Can' and the brilliantly catchy 'Who Knew' get lost between the slower tracks, which are in no way bad but just dont gel together. <br />I much prefer feisty pink to the miserable one. <br />Stand out track?- 'Leave me alone (im lonely)' her best track ever in my opinion.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|Your review would say that this is the greatest piece of metal ever written. Or maybe that this is the first metal band to get an entire orchestra to record with and you would be wrong. Im not saying this is a bad album I enjoy listening to it and is easily one of the best Orchestra driven metal albums ever but therein lies the problem. The band does nothing new and honestly plays nothing even remotely awe inspiring to any well trained ears.<br /><br />The good side is what the band lacks the orchestra makes up for. These are some seriously devoted individuals only outdone by my personal favourite orchestral driven metal group 'Therion'. And the feel to this album is truely EPIC and if I was the one choosen to label this type of music I would call it Epic Metal.<br /><br />The guitar riffs though fitting well are nothing an amateur guitarist couldn't play by ear. Guitar solos are few and as well not quite as great as the fore mentioned group 'Therion' nor practically all other metal groups. To be honest I rather enjoyed the bass lines, Though not complex they fit extremely well into each track and are oftenly showcased well. The drumming is very good as i've never been a big fan of Nightwish for the drumming he truely stepped up on this release and put down some very worthy beats.<br /><br />Keyboards/Programming was one thing that was not well showcased more so then anything and im supprized I hadn't sen any reviews speak of this as previous Nightwish albums are loaded with KB. Though there are a few good KB sections, Nothing truely dramatic as on past albums which is a shame cause I truely admire the keyboardists talent. Now onto the one part that can make or break the album depending on your style... Nightwish vocals.<br /><br />This is to be Tarjas last Hoorah with Nightwish as she has been ejected from the band due to problems between band mates. She is an excellent vocalist and is appearantly trained in the ways of operatic vocals, Something that is gifted not just taught. She hits every note on the head and even now and then breaks from the operatic vocals to sing as a normal vocalist would. Best part is her male counter part on the album truely adds aggresion to the tracks with his deep Power Metal cliche vocals. Lyrics are up and down through out the album, here and there they are a bit repititive and uncreative whereas other times are deep and meaningful.<br /><br />Nightwish's Once is a good album if you enjoy Melodic Metal and even more so if you enjoy Metal with a more Operatic feel. The truth is though I may have said negative things about the band I really enjoy listening to this album. AS A WHOLE this album is great, I just really wish the band would have all stepped up to the plate and either matched or surpassed the talent of the Orchestra.. When Nightwish accomplishes that.. Then we will have a truely great Nightwish record.gifted not just taught. She hits every note on the head and even now and then breaks from the operatic vocals to sing as a normal vocalist would.

B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers are what rock has been waiting for with a fusion of punk and electro influences they've made the genre sound fresh and this album is the proof. <br />With no fillers, just catchy bouncing riffs and memorable lyrics this is the best album of the past few years in my opinion, with 'Mr Brightside' being in my top ten greataest tracks ever. <br />If you want an album of anthematic rock pop to air guitar around your house to then this is it.
0790729407|5.0|Like Braveheart, Michael Collins captures all the passion and drama of the struggle for freedom and independence from an oppressive ruler (in both cases, the British.)  Also like Braveheart, this movie tends to excessively glorify the hero and demonize the villains.  Of course, it achieves the effect of distinguishing the good guys from the bad, giving the audience a (clear) side to pick.<br /><br />It is beautifully shot, well-scripted and suspenseful.  It's also fairly accurate historically, the costumes and sets are spot-on, and there is adequate (and appropriate) lightheartedness.  The battle scenes are riveting and the movie is loaded with (true) cloak-and-dagger bits.  The love triangle between Michael Collins (Liam Neeson), Kitty Kiernan (Julia Roberts) and Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn), though somewhat indispensable to the \\"Big Fella's\\" story, muddles things in spots.  Neil Jordan managed to make the romance fit in the story without forcing it or resorting to too much sappiness.<br /><br />For the most part, the acting is very good.  Neeson plays the \\"Big Fella\\" about as well as one could imagine.  Stephen Rea is nothing short of awesome and shows why he is, unfortunately, one of the most under-appreciated actors around.  The rest of the cast performs adequately or better.<br /><br />All that said, its weaknesses are fairly apparent.  One, Mr. Jordan surely could have found an Irish actress to play Kitty Kiernan.  Instead, we're subjected to Julia Roberts' lousy Irish accent.  At that time Michael Collins came out, Roberts was in a lot of movies and picking her - a Yankee, no less - for this part seemed as yet another instance of having her forced upon the viewing public.  Two, the movie oversimplifies issues regarding the Irish struggle for independence.  Of course, a movie is not necessarily the venue in which to explain all sides to an issue, but if you knew nothing of Irish history and saw this film, you'd think that Ireland's troubles solely resulted from the arbitrary actions of her oppressive English overlords.<br /><br />Michael Collins is a fantastic movie, one of my all-time favorites.  Even with its flaws, it's a classic.lted from the arbitrary actions of her oppressive English overlords.   <br /> <br />Michael Collins is a fantastic movie, one of my all-time favorites.

B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morrisette is the queen of angry, angsty yet heartbreakingly vunerable lyrics. <br />Every person should have this in their cd collection its that good! <br />A perfect balance of moody and hopeful this album engages you from the very first listen and i still play it as much as i did when it was first released. <br />Gronudbreaking and honest a cd that could not be bettered.
0553801503|3.0|Introduces a lot of new persons, does not follow through on story line or original promises.  Like the great race car drivers, who can win with a car that should not even show!  so too the master story teller can \\"beat the odds\\" and produce a GOOD story from one that should not even show.  Still, it is pure pleasure to watch and read the \\"music of master with vehicle to match.\\"
B000FFJ85I|2.0|I was very happy to see thatAFI was going to finally have a new record out. They were pretty dormant in 2005 and left one to wonder if they were still around. Then, there was talk of this new record coming out. The first time I heard \\"Miss Murder\\" I was like you have got to be kidding me. But after awhile, it kinda grew on me. At least enough to wanna check the album out. MY brother and I finally found it online about two weeks ago, and after Sing the Sorrow this is one of the biggest disappointments to ever be heard. When everyone gave up on them after STS came out, I was still a strong loyal fan because when seen for what it was, it was a work of greatness. Every song had something to add to the album, they were all solidly placed, and the lyrics, vocals and musicianship were all top notch, even if they did go a little \\"emo\\". This album is the exact opposite. Instead of just being a little emo, or even really emo, they just went completely pop on us, more than half of these songs are generic and boring (especially the terrible filler track \\"Kill Caustic\\"), the vocals are the worst they have ever been, and it's too short to feel solid. Whenever we got the record, we were like \\"Miss Murder better be the worst song on this CD\\" but it ended up being the best one. That song, track 4, and track 11 are really the only songs on here that have any staying power. Oh, and I might add, the intro no this album is the worst intro theyve ever had. It sounds like a girl singing over rap music. Yes, they put a rap beat in there. The whole thing is stupid. Oh, and if you've seen the video for their new single, it is also extremely stupid. On STS, they wore all kinds of makeup and stuff but it was just like a look to go with the feel of the album. On this album, they jsut look stupid. Especially becuase Davey and Jade look  like scene clowns, and then Hunter and Carson just look like average people who arent wearing any makeup or weird clothes. Oh, and all the techno stuff they dabble into in this album, none of it fits it just sounds forced in there. After hearing them do Black Sails and The Art of Drowning (IMO, the best album), and then the direction they went in on Sing The Sorrow, I thought this record was going to be truly great. But instead, it is nothin more than average, generic, and just a run for the pop market. Other than the 3 tracks I mnetioned, there isn't really anything worth hearing on this. Track 5 made me want to kill myself it was so depressing and slooooow. I hope their next record is somewhat of a return to form of the previous 3 albums in their career with some new ideas that are actually GOOD. After this though, I won't be holding my breath. If you're gonna change, change for the better.
B000E5KOJS|4.0|This is a movie version of Cosi in which the performers lip synch to a pre-recorded sound track. I expected it to detract mightily from the quality of the production, but it doesn't for two reasons. First, the lip synching is just about flawless. I don't recall seeing lips moving without the words matching (although there's a slight change in the tone of the audio as the singing starts and the soundtrack switches to \\"pre-recorded\\" mode). Second, the director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle gathered a first-rate group of performers, led by the great Edita Gruberova as Fiordiligi. Gruberova's \\"Per pieta\\" is reason alone to see (and hear) this production.<br /><br />So, it's a trade-off. You lose the spontaneous and intimate feel of a live onstage performance, but you gain a sound track that is recording-studio quality.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Has anyone noticed that the majority of the people trash talking 10,000 days state lateralus as the greatest tool album.  Each tool album is so intense that most people dont have the copacity to jump right on for the next ride.  If you dont have the patients to listen to this new album (several times in a row for hours on end), then dont call yourself a tool fan.  I'm just now able to swallow lateralus.  Aenema has had its hold since its realease.  I was so happy when I saw the album artwork.  I swear the sounds on the last song(viginti tres)are coming from inside the (net of being) picture.  If you need to, go ahead and dose, dont let yourself get stuck inside though.  Its overwhelmingly large, endless, and when the heads sound off simultaneously your mind can be shattered.  Just bring a rope and you'll get back just fine. <br /> <br />SIT BACK AND ENJOY
0446693804|5.0|If you have read the notebook or any of the other Nicholas Sparks books, prepare to be blown away. This is the best book I have read in my life. This is a heartfelt love story about two people who would have never fallen for eachother because of the status quo, but did anyway. Even if you are not into mushy romance novels, read this anyway;its different. It is a quick read that I read in just a few days. Read this book and you will be changed for the better.
B0000VCZKW|4.0|I vividly remember seeing this movie in the theaters years ago, and I was really excited when the Special Edition DVD came out. While I agree that the full-screen format is a little disappointing, the special features are fun and the film is the same fun and slightly dark humor that we've all come to love.    Mara Wilson was a child actress who always seemed to have a special quality about her. Precocious, adorable, and wise beyond her years, she gave an ideal portrayal of the classic children's book heroine. Child stars didn't get as much long-term recognition back then, and many of them (like Wilson) ended up being able to have a normal teen and adult life thereafter, but you can bet that if Wilson was a young child in the current 2007, she'd be as much of a hot ticket as Abigail Breslin and maybe even Dakota Fanning. These days, those cute, smart, and talented little dynamos are being stretched further than ever before.    Getting back to the movie, I was always a bit wary when I heard how it was being sold as \\"a great story with a great message.\\" What's the message--that this little girl was a despised, \\"disgusting little brute\\" to her family and a little monster to be squashed by her school headmistress? That she was loved so little by her own parents that they signed her away to her teacher without barely a second thought? Granted, the ending was sweet in its own particular right, but it hardly sends the kind of message that parents would want to send to their child.    Just the same, so long as this film is seen as a fantasy story more than a depiction of reality, I don't see any problem in showing it to younger audiences. Heck, I saw it when I was 11 years old and absolutely loved it (although some of the Trunchbull scenes were a bit over-the-top and disturbing). As I said before, Mara Wilson is a terrific little Matilda, Danny DeVito and Rhea Pearlman are hilarious as the self-absorbed parents, Embeth Davidtz delivers perfectly as the sweet and gentle MissHoney, and Pam Ferris outdoes herself as the unforgettable \\"Miss Trunchbull,\\" a character that will surely go down in infamy. In short, it's a nice film to share with the family and definitely worth a look if you enjoy sweet, funny, and occasionally dark humor with a darling little girl at the center.
B000002UAO|5.0|Yes that cover visually sets the visual impact and sheds the innocent mop top days,, This is my favourite Beatle (as Paul would say) \\"LP\\"..I'm a huge Beatle fan and admire their style and musical talents.Great sounds and recording with smooth flow of the musical material..If you are true to the origional songs from the album you will find yourself making a personal compulation CD burn( after purchasing the CD's)  to include the two missing tracks and possibly omiting the substiuted tracks now on the CD version,, love the songs, love the era.. this CD is a must have for all Beatles fans or those loving these 60's era gems... highly recommended
0887307280|5.0|Mr. Gerber creatively introduces the three personalities of business as the Technician, the Manager and the Entrepreneur.  In order for one to truly suceed in business, these personalities must all be present, but must be in the correct proportions as well.    <br /> <br />His concept of franchising obviously should not be taken too literally.  But when you think about it, it really makes sense.  If you are have a business that is a \\"franchise\\", you are sucessfully acting as the the Entrepreneur, the Technician and most importantly, the Manager.   <br /> <br />This book may be difficult for so-called Entrepreneurs to grasp.  Especially because so many \\"Entrepreneurs\\" are stuck in the Technician personality.  (Unless of course, they are balancing the 3 personalities, and if that is the case, they will find little use for this book, as they are already sucessful.)   <br /> <br />Ideally, this book is great for Consultants with clients who call themselves Entrepreneurs, but are actually Technicians.  There is nothing wrong with this, but so many of the Tech's are seeking outside advice as they are over their head at the moment, and need some relief as they are doing Everything in the business. Hence, if you have a client like this, read this book and use it as your guide.  It will assist you as you invent your own creative examples to assist your individual clients.  Perhaps as your client shifts personalities, then it may be appropropriate for them to read it on their own.  Otherwise, they probably won't get it.
B00005JP4U|4.0|I recommend this documentary to everyone interested in our home planet. As a scientist and as a teacher, I have been aware of the information presented in the documentary for years. I have been passing the information along, except that I did not have all of the supporting data/graphs presented in the documentary.  An Inconvenient truth is not a doomsday view of the destruction of the world, but an eye opener for those that are still in denial about what is happening to the planet as a result of deforestation and excessive greenhouse gas emissions.  There are steps we can take to start reversing the excessive warming our planet is experiencing, and a number of the steps are presented to the audience.  If you care about what we are doing to this planet of ours, go see the documentary and take your friends along.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Having seen Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911 soon after is was in the theaters, I viewed this documentary with an open mind and was so shocked learning that the whisper into Mr. Bush's ear was his security person was telling him that a second plane had hit the second tower, when he knowingly knew the first one had already been hit, but proceeded on for a photo-op to the Florida grade school classroom.  Now, wouldn't you think with all the communication he has available he could have posponed the reading of \\"My Pet Goat\\" and headed back to Washington, D.C.  Yes, a straight thinking individual would have done that.  I came out of the theater in shock and grabbed this documentary as soon as it came out on DVD.  My mission is to educate people by loaning them my copy for showing in their living rooms so many more people can see exactly what we have for leadership in these United States and that this was a business deal gone bad.  The average person has their head buried in the sand and are ashamed that they voted for this born-again christian, and do not want to believe that the person with the highest office in the land would lie about WMD's and put the average working man's children in harms way.  What a tragedy in this once fine country when our leadership has failed time and time again in a rich man's war with a poor man's children paying the price.  What goes around comes around.
0060763280|1.0|Eker has taken all the old tried-and-true information and created an industry.  This book comes in every form imaginable, and Eker even created a deck of cards so we won't forgot his pearls of wisdom which amount to variations on the golden rule and other dirt-basic \\"reminders\\" (as if we need any more of that stuff floating around).<br /><br />Not only did Eker take old information, he even cashed in on an old title.  Readers might remember the bestseller \\"The Millionaire Mind\\"?  It wasn't written by Eker.<br /><br />In this book, Eker offers a lot of free goodies at his website.  But to get into that website, you have to enter a registration number found at the back of the book.  My book doesn't have one.  Yesterday I went back to the book store and checked, and none of Eker's books have registration numbers.  On the way home I stopped at another bookstore and found the same problem.  I wrote to Eker via e-mail, and was told that \\"if\\" I still had my sales slip (I didn't), that I could enter a number from that.  What's with the speakeasy attitude?  What is this character trying to prove?<br /><br />The whole thing is just too slimy for me, from the littering of seminar ads throughout the book to the self-righteous \\"I've Changed Millions Of Lives\\" attitude.  Eker is the kind of guy who gives rich people a bad name. Yes, I want to get it into my head that it's all right to have money, but I don't want Eker telling me how to do it.  He should be selling used cars.
B0000648WZ|5.0|The open and shut story of this film is Humans fighting for survival against an Alien bug race which threaten planet earth. There is a mild love story thrown in with this movie but the bug battles are the main focus and rightly so too because they are incredible.  <br />Although this movie was made in 1997 and the special effect capabillities where already pretty impressive this film really pushed the boundaries. In every battle between the humans and bugs they are on an amazing scale and every detail is superb.  <br />Be warned though this film comes with its 18 rating for a reason, very gory and i really mean that being killed by a bug piercing your body with 4 of its legs doesn't come with a price of showing some blood and guts.  <br />Excellent film and very captivating especially if you're into the futuristic side of things.

All i do have to say however is Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz are superb choices as the voices of the main characters.  <br />This is an incredibly warm hearted and fun family film that a child of any age would love. <br />
B000AY74OG|5.0|I thought this would be a stack of rubbish, having seen the preview which was on the Shrek video. We saw this with our kids at a friends house and immediately bought the DVD. Not only is it a great movie, but it has some fabulous extras. <br /> <br />The story is about 4 friends at the New York Zoo - Alex the lion, Melman the Giraffe, A Zebra and Gloria the Hippopotamus. The penguins escape setting up a longing in the Zebra for freedon, even at Connecticut. So he escapes one night to try to get to the wide open spaces of Connecticut, just for the night. alex, Gloria and Melman race off to bring him back, not knowing he was coming back on his own. However it goes horribly bad and they get bundled up to be sent off back to a wildlife preserve in Kenya. Only the Penguins make a break on the container ship first, taking it over and driving it to Antarctica. The sudden turn in the ship unsettles the load and the 4 friends float off in their containers, landing in Madagascar. <br /> <br />Wonderful animation, and hugely good-humoured. There is King Julian the strange 'squirrel' who is king of the Lemurs on Madagascar, they are all afraid of the 'foosa' who are some kind of feral lions. King Julian (voiced by the wonderful Sacha Baron Cohen aka Ali G) is fabulous, not only is the voice great, but so is the script.  <br /> <br />The penguins are also a highlight, the voices are great, the animation is fabulous, and the script is wonderful for them. There are gorgeous little touches in this movie and the penguins have some of the best of them. Talking of special features, there is a nice little movie in the DVD special features of the Penguins at Christmas at the zoo - priceless! <br /> <br />There are some good special features on this, one of the best is if you flick the up switch over play a couple of penguins appear, click OK and see how the animation is made, how Alex's mane is animated, how they make animals run in sand, how Madagascar jungle is pasted together from avariety of different types of trees and so on. It is simply sketches set to music but it is wonderful. <br /> <br />This is such an appealing movie, it is fun for all ages and the DVD has several features which are also appealing to everyone.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|I generally like this type of horror story and I very much enjoyed the first one. So I was very disappointed with this movie. <br /> <br />The story I thought was fairly weak, the acting, I thought was quite poor. Kate Beckinsale does not do nearly as good a job as she did in the previous one. <br /> <br />The special effects are okay. Nothing really brilliant. <br /> <br />If I had not liked the first one so much, I probably would not have bothered to see the end of this one.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Decemberunderground, the long-awaited seventh AFI album, was officially released today. This album is the beautiful product of its 3-year production (and it was more than worth the wait). Every single song on this album brings something different to the overall sound. I have listened to the CD about 500 times today and I cannot say enough good things about it. <br /> <br />1.) Prelude 12/21- The second I heard this song, I knew what I was in for on the rest of the album. It is one of my favorite songs on the CD, and I still am amazed at how beautiful Davey's voice sounds. The beat in the background makes the song feel very anthemic. Really beautiful lyrics. \\"Kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep.\\" <br /> <br />2.) Kill Caustic- GREAT song. It is a little taste of the harder side of AFI, and it is awesome to shout along with. It comes fully equipped with Davey's classic singing/shouting combination. Apparently, it is going to be their second single off of this album. Great choice! \\"Love these screams like I do.\\" <br /> <br />3.) Miss Murder- The perfect choice for a single. It is probably the poppiest song on the album, which is in no way a bad thing. But on a second listen, you hear that the lyrics kind of contradict the poppy melody. It's an absolutely amazing song, and one that I can listen to over and over again. <br /> <br />4.) Summer Shudder- I love this song! This is another poppy one, but once again that only contributes to the beauty of the song. I'm surprised that not too many people have written reviews about it. The chorus is amazing, I love the chants (\\"Under the summer rain...\\") and the guitar is great. <br /> <br />5.) The Interview- The first really mellow song on the album. The chorus is gorgeous and really meaningful. \\"For a change I'll refrain from hiding all of me from you.\\" I also love the organ outtro, which contains the title of the album. <br /> <br />6.) Love Like Winter- AWESOME SONG. Really uplifting. This track is a breath of fresh air betweenthe sometimes depressing (but very beautiful) melodies that AFI is known for. Davey speaks Spanish briefly in this track, as he is known to do. Really really great song. <br /> <br />7.) Affliction- Another one of the harder tracks on the album. Great guitar riffs. Goes from shoutsinging verses to a very melodic chorus. \\"Oh, I will be all right, just use me.\\" I love the lyrics to this song, and the frequent \\"Lover, I am lonely.\\" It's great how it slows down near the end with just the guitar and Davey's amazing vocals, singing \\"Remain lifeless, love.\\" Amazing song. <br /> <br />8.) The Missing Frame- This is an incredible song. It starts off somewhat hard, and then it gets more mellow, which is kind of reflective of the direction AFI is heading. Great drum intro. <br /> <br />9.) Kiss And Control- One of my favorites off the album. What a great song! Definitely one of the best choruses off the album. Also contains an awesome spoken part. <br /> <br />10.) The Killing Lights- My other favorite off this album! I absolutely adore this song!! \\"It's killing time again.\\" I think this album, and this song, really contain a lot of more autobiographical material than some of their previous tracks off other albums. Awesome, awesome song. <br /> <br />11.) 37mm- Starts out kind of creepy-in a good way-and progresses to a GREAT chorus. \\"Do you fall too? Everytime that I try to pacify I fall.\\" Nice piano in the background. I love the quiet repetition of \\"we are no one\\" at the end. <br /> <br />12.) Endlessly, She Said- A beautiful way to finish the album. Georgeous song, definitely one of the best tracks off the album. No signature secret tracks, but the beauty of the other songs definitely makes up for it. <br /> <br />This album is vastly different, and more mellow, than anything this band has done before, so it is important to keep an open mind. Decemberunderground is the consummation of AFI's 15-year evolution from garage band teenage punks to a master race, that of which isbeautifully reflected in this album.

B000FFJ85I|5.0|AFI, as is typical of them, have completely redefined themselves as a band. The evolution from Sing the Sorrow may be hard on some fans as this is a complete departure from their old self. In a way I felt like I was listening to a new band, and fortunately for me, it was a band I loved. The first three tracks (those which AFI had available before the official release) really do not stand as a prelude to the rest of the album.  <br /> <br />AFI seems to take on a different genre or influence in every song to set them apart. If you were expecting the sorrow-filled and meloncholic atmosphere from STS, you are in for a shock. Decemberunderground is played on a larger scale and gives a feeling of unity through the group choruses and overall lighter feel: They have truely mastered what it means to let misery sing. I felt uplifted throughout this album.  <br /> <br />Davey's voice is still Davey's, but I cannot say enough about his improved skill. The ranges he uses in each song is beyond STS and those that pay attention will enjoy bits and pieces of Davey's singing immensely. As far as the music, there is a greater use of electronic beats, but don't let that worry you. They are used very well with the music and do not come off as dull or goofy at all, and throughout the songs, you can barely recognize or care about the use of electronics because they only add to the overall beauty of the album.  <br /> <br />There are definite influences littered throughout the album like The Cure and even a U2 sounding chorus in Love Like Winter. <br />Some of the highlights of the album are: <br />1. Summer Shudder (great chorus and a straight rock feel) <br />2. Affliction (an amazing bridge that shows Davey's amazing voice) <br />3. Kiss and Control (many unique AFI moments in this song, get ready for surprises) <br />4. Endlessly, She Said (the most passionate song on the album) <br /> <br />Get ready to fall in love with AFI all over again on Decemberunderground. (10/10)
076790592X|2.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is a book about coming to terms with death and dealing with life's biggest woes. Personally I was disappointed with this book, when I read a book I expect a story and to be entertained, not preached to about how I should live my life. Not that the whole book was bad, I really liked the periodic aphorisms that stuck in your head and really got you thinking, and the message the book leaves you with. Every Tuesday the main character, Mitch, meets with his old college professor and they discuss different topics such as death, love, family and the pursuit of happiness. This is fine and cute but does not leave much of a story to get into, the book is very repetitive, and the only interesting story is the brief one page flash backs every other chapter. This is not a horrible book, and I think it would be a great read for anyone who is dealing with a serious disease, or has a loved one they are losing to a disease. As someone who has a loved one who is suffering from a serious disease it was a reinsuring book. It helped me see that even though my loved one is sick, there is still so much they have to offer, and so much I can learn from them.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|This is not cinema.  Is not even a film proper.  Is the equivalent of a pitching or brainstorm reunion on the screen.  Ideas for set-pieces are thrown at light-speed, none of them impressive or intelligent.  The prologue is nice and effects overall are good, but is all very (VERY) irrelevant.  Nothing is done of vampires or werewolfes, in a movie about vampires and werewolfes!  There is a couple of shots of naked Kate Beckinsale.  Cool.  That's it.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood just finished it's final episode about 30 minutes ago. It it by far the best tv show I've ever seen. I doubt any other show like it will come for several years, if possibly ever. I bought the Season 1 DVD's about a year ago shortly after the third season began, and I really enjoyed with finally getting to learn things I hadn't known about the characters because I started watching during the second season. <br /> <br />I can only thorize that CW canceled the show because it was more wholesome and family oriented than their other shows (sans 7th Heaven which survived even it's Series Finale due to amazing feed back). I only hope that the rest of the seasons are released soon, because I really want to be able to rewatch it and perhaps when I have a family, they'll be able to watch it and experience the attachment to the characters that I've developed over the last three years.
0553266306|5.0|Researched over three years and written in 45 days over thirty years ago, this is still the best thriller I have ever read. I've seen its influences in so many books and films since. Forsyth, by way of a dead-pan and cold prose, maintains an air of mystery and callous efficiency in the assassin during the course of the book. Even now I don't really know what his real name was, or nationality \\"...rumour was that the man was an Englishman.\\" Rather like the detective on his trail I feel some admiration for the clinical would be assassin and a small part of me wanted him to succeed at the end. Whenever you read a good thriller always remember, if you haven't read this already, that there's a better one out there waiting for you.
1400079179|2.0|Mr. Brown has shown that he based his book on some hoax which have long been declared as pure lunatic fancination.<br /><br />By writing this book, he challenged the wisdom and intellgence of billions of people thru the history and declared that everyone else was wrong and only he was right. Does that sound familiar to you? But he is not even historian and the only interest he had in history is to make a name for himself and to make him rich. Is everyone else telling a lie while Dan Brown is the only person telling the truth? The last time I saw a person made a similar claim was in a psychiatric hospital during a visit.<br /><br />Dan Brown based his book on a supposedly secret organization, Priory of Sion, and he claimed that the organization was in existance since 11 Century. But Priory of Sion was no secret and it had nothing to do with protecting Jesus bloodline. It was a club in France only established in 1954 and its objective was no more than promoting low budget housing. Then a French fugitive Pierre Plantard used this club's name to claim that he was in the bloodline of Jesus and many French kings. He also faked a lot of documents. This Pierre Plantard who had criminal record and had been jailed earlier later admitted in court that he fabricated the whole scheme about the Pierre of Sion. Mr.Brown, I can see you sweating face, again.<br /><br />According to Mr Brown's account the Priory of Sion was founded in Jerusalem in 1099 by a French crusader King Geoffrey of Bouillion and his ancestors preserved a `great secret' handed down from generations to generations from the time of Christ alleging that Jesus and MagDalene had a Daughter Sarah. They continued to claim that Jesus' bloodline continues through Sarah in the Merovingian dynasty of French Kings even to this Day Dan Brown book calls out to watch out for this great revelation.<br /><br />The Priory of Sion was found to be fraudulent in 1956 and traced to an origin from a reactionary anti-Semitic Frenchman with a criminal record who invented the story and registered these beliefs officially. The forger Pierre Plantard had made a list of \\"Grand Masters\\", the document of these and their genealogy, together with those of the grandmasters, are in a cache found in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. These are all found to be false. Plantard's hoax was exposed in a series of French books and BBC documentary in 1966<br /><br />Hence the most important strand of the plot of the Da Vinci Code is a total hoax. So we have to tell people who read the Da Vinci Code that it is a Hoax. Don't be afraid.<br /><br />I am not suprised that someone like Brown would write a book to defame Jesus. A lot of people thru history have done that and even when Jesus still lived. But I was really suprised to see how easily people can be cheated. The majority of people seemed only too eager to accept any rubbish to defame Jesus and Christianity, and they would never hear a thing when you tell them Dan Brown is NOT their hero and Da Vinci Code is based on pure hoax.<br /><br />The great French writer Hugo said that the entire English literature was based on one man's books, which is Shakespear's books, but the whole England was based on only one book: the Bible. When we have rid of all the treasure of the West which our democratic societies are based upon, we have nothing left but trash like Dan Brown's Code.<br />can we believe Dan Brown who declared that sexual intercourse with a group of people is a holy ceremony for a supposedly Christian society, the Priory of Sion? Dogs would know better, Mr. Brown.<br /><br />I am also suprised why there is no Christian organizations to sue Dan Brown who based his book on the hoax and fabrication by the French criminal and fugitive Pierre Plantard when he declared that everything in his book is true to history?<br /><br />I do see the difference between Dan Brown and the French fugitive Pierre Plantard from whom he borrowed the concept of Priory of Sion: one of them made the desperate hoax and was sent to prison; the other became a great writer of our time. Who said that a small lie has a little impact, but a great lie has great impact?<br />(It tears down it destroys. So this is what Dan Brown has done. If he did this against the Moslems, or the Hindus, or the Buddhist, would he get away with it? But the Christians are quiescent)became a great writer of our time.

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Final Fantasy VII.  The name alone brings back memories of the arguably best of the Final Fantasy series.  You can't say Final Fantasy VII without thinking about Cloud, Marlene, Barret, and all the rest.<br /><br />  Two years after the events of the game, Advent Children follows the adventures of Cloud, who is in deep mourning over the death of Aerith still after two years.  Meanwhile, 3 men are looking for thier mother -- Jenova.  Along the way, Cloud runs into his friends, including Vincent.<br /><br />  The movie is action-packed, much like The Matrix movies.  There's hardly a slow moment in Advent Children, which hurts it just a little.  Nobody who ever played Final Fantasy VII won't be too interested in the movie...because the film visits much of the locations of the game.  Still, it's a good movie to an excellent game.

A bunch of ferocious tunes that display what Trick does best, but I hate the cover though.<br /><br />Only Deep Purple's latest, \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" (Nov. '05) is as good as this. It's great to see all these veteran rockers coming up with the goods. There is nothing weak on \\"Rockford,\\" and even the fillers are very good. The production and musicianship are strong as always. This is much, much better than their last album, \\"Special One.\\" Finally, Cheap Trick has done an album as memorable as their legacy. Oh there's no place like home!<br /><br />Highlights:  Welcome to the World, Come On Come On Come On, If It Takes A Lifetime, This Time You Got It, Give It Away and  Decaf.<br /><br />Bravo Cheap Trick and Deep Purple!
0895260131|1.0|This book was quite disturbing to read. It is full of very selective quotations and excerpts of history. This selective information combined with the language used paints a very biased and I believe untrue picture of Islam and Islamic history.<br /><br />It would take an entire book to refute the many distortions that fill this book. Verses from the Quran are taken out of context, for example leaving out preceding or following verses that clearly show that Muslims are only to wage \\"jihad\\" if they are being persecuted or attacked. There is an explicit verse in the Quran that there is no compulsion in religion - no one can be forced to convert. Respect and toleration is explicitly commanded for Jews and Christians. In any event, any logical person who studies history can see that Muslims have been more tolerant of Christians than vice versa. Christians lived peacefully under Muslim rule in Spain for more than 700 years, for example. That's a lot longer than Caucasians have lived here in America! When the Christians took over, every single Muslim was killed, expelled, or forcibly converted. Muslims lived in southern Italy for centuries also. They too were completely eliminated. Millions of Muslims were killed in Eastern Europe, and of course during the Crusades. Contrast this to the continual presense of millions of Christians in Muslim lands, such as the Copts in Egypt. How have they flourished for centuries in Muslim countries if terrible persecution was present?<br /><br />Unfortunately, most people who enjoy this sort of book are convinced any other point of view is pro-Islam propaganda. I would urge such people and other readers to also read books by Karen Armstrong and George Esposito, who present a more balanced view. Also, read a Quran yourself or attend a local mosque and listen to what they say in the Friday sermon. Muslims have nothing to hide. Don't let this book be your only source of information.
1400079179|4.0|Jesus was one day a man and the next day divine. Do not hate me for what Im about to say because you are only hating the truth. I know for sure that Jesus was not the son of God. He did heal the blind and he did raise the dead, but he did so with the power of the one and only God. The one God who never had a son or needed a son. Jesus was mortal and human like me and you.He drank and ate food and used the restroom like me and you. Nowhere did he ever utter the words \\"I am the son of God or I am God\\"..not even in the Bible. The belief of the Jews and Muslims is that Jesus was not God is correct. Although the Jews don't think as positively of Jesus as Muslims do. This man who wrote this book is a great man for mentioning the lost Gospels. These are the Gospels which Jesus declares that he was a prophet. Check your history Christians and you will see that Men(Paul) came up with the idea that Jesus was God, not Jesus himself. IF 2 billion people are following a system of beliefs that are not the true teachings of its follower, then this is the greatest coverup of all-time. Mary Magdaline has nothing to do with it. After reading this book, I reccomend that you read the dozen or so books by Ahmed Deedat, one of the best Bible Scholars of recent history. Be prepared to think differently.
B00005NVT1|5.0|Alive was a very good listen as you got to hear the famous hits such as, Da Funk, Rollin' & Scratchin', & Alive.  I like how it started off with the elements of Daftendirekt and quickly built itself into Da Funk.  The improvs between each song was very cool and by them making each song a bit more extended in their LIVE performance made for listeners want to hear more it.  A lot of people say that LIVE performances really aren't much because they don't sound as good as a studio performance, but I beg to differ.  LIVE performances by techno artists and groups are, most of the times, some of their best work.  Other examples would include the LIVE cuts from Underworld or The Chemical Brothers.  Daft Punk shows extends the pleasure of these hit tracks off of their Homework CD and gives the listeners a privilege.  Alive 1997 is a must for the fans, along with their other material of course.

I didn't even feel anything but the fact that maybe not having an ending would have been better.  <br />The book should have ended with the judge's descion.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|This album is soothing to the ears. Fans of A.F.I. are probably expecting this huge heavy album, it is actually the most mellow album they have ever done, but it's amazing, and could be their best CD to date. <br /> <br />The CD starts with \\"Prelude 12/21\\" which is the best intro they have ever done to a CD, with soft Davey Havoc vocals, also including strings, and the A.F.I. trademark \\"Whoa\\" <br /> <br />It then goes into the aggresive \\"Kill Caustic\\" <br /> <br />The CD continues like a normal CD until we get to \\"Love Like Winter\\" which is a beautiful balladic way to start the second half of the CD. <br /> <br />\\"The Missing Frame\\" come two songs later and is my personal favorite track of the CD. It is not what one would expect from the band, it is very alternative, but it is just one word, beautiful. <br /> <br />The song following it \\"Kiss and Control\\" is a very A.F.I. song including Davey speaking the vocals intensely at the bridge of the song. <br /> <br />The ending track to the CD \\"Endlessly, She Said\\" is very close to being the very best song on the CD. Extremely melodic and anthemetic, it will soon be a very popular A.F.I. song. <br /> <br />The only thing that is very disappointing about the CD is that there is no hidden tracks as in their previous three CD's which always prove to be very good songs. But, \\"Endlessly, She Said\\" is a great way to end the CD. <br /> <br />In short, this CD can only be described in one word, beautiful. They have outdone themselves again. This CD is a breath of fresh air.
0312323859|4.0|I really liked this book. I have read \\"Something Borrowed\\" and felt like I did get Rachel's side of the story. I was not necessarily interested in Darcy's side of the story...I wanted to find out what happens with Rachel and Dex.  <br />Darcy is really funny. Not really smart. She is a leap before you look kind of girl. Everything always ends up working out her way, until she pulls a crazy stunt and get's pregnant with the slacker Marcus' baby. For the first time in her charmed life she is completely vulnerable. It's good to see her go from being a shallow \\"me, me, me\\" bratt to a responsible adult who finds love from where she least expects it. <br />FYI this book gives you 411 on what happens with Dex and Rachel.
0446677450|5.0|This book doesn't tell you exactly how to be rich, I believe no book can, but it will point you the way an it can be applied in any field of work. When I finished reading it, it opened my eyes to use money differently and start placing money to work for me, not to work for my money, which is the middle-class standard. I maybe not be rich now or in the future but I know that I will be using a different route to financial success. It woke up my financial intelligence and every day I watch the market and seek investment opportunities, even though I'm still in college. One of the best 10 dollars I spent on a paperback.

B00029NMRM|4.0|I love this movie for a few reasons.  One of those reasons is that I'm a HUGE fan of the previous film 'The Whole Nine Yards' to which this serves as the sequel.  The next is the fact that Bruce Willis is one of the best of the underrated actors out there and captivates my attention with every performance he gives.  The third, and biggest reason I love this film is a little scene where Jimmy (Willis) and Oz (Perry) visit the local pub and get a little (or a lot) drunk.  The whole scene is worth the price of the rental.  I guess since it reminds me so much of myself and my friends (I'm an emotional drunk) and the whole morning after thing is so the way it would happen.  All in all the laughs are there, some are forced and the gags can be a bit cheesy.  'The Whole Nine Yards' was a far superior film, but this sequel is not without it's moments and Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry are a great comic team.  Bruce can tackle everything from action to comedy to drama and should be recognized a little more for that.  This may not end up your favorite title but it won't be your least.  The premise follows Oz and Jimmy as they try and rescue Oz's wife (Jimmy's ex) from a mob boss trying to get revenge on Jimmy.  Amanda Peet plays Jimmy's wife whose fed up with the softy Jimmy has become and is trying to be the tough contract killer that Jimmy once was.  There are subplots and a twist at the end that makes this more than a no-brainer, but the fact still remains that the film makes little sense...but it doesn't really matter.  Just sit back, relax, don't think about it and enjoy it for what it is...or at least watch the drunk scene, then pop in 'The Whole Nine Yards' and really enjoy yourself.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Yes it is true that Fantasia has been edited, but that is because Disney had to edit something that by today's standards would be socially unacceptable. for the time the movie was made (1942) it would be a different situation. I agree with their decision to edit those parts out, although you can find the scenes on the internet, and they are interesting to watch, but I can agree that they were edited for good reason. and it is true, just because a movie is edited doesn't mean that those parts weren't there, but if you want to own Fantasia on DVD, then this is worth buying. the only difference from the VHS version to note is, the narration has been re-recorded, and though it is not the original narration, it is still good I only noted 1 or 2 differences in the narration from the original. this is the best (socially acceptable) copy of Fantasia you will ever find, those of you who are looking for the original version (ie 1942) you are out of luck, every re-release of this movie since the 1970's has been edited, and unless you want celluloid film you'll just have to get this.
B000002H33|5.0|This is perhaps my all-time favorite album.<br /><br />Like all bands, Metallica evolved from album to album.  Master of Puppets fits into that perfect point in their past when the band had achieved technical mastery while holding on to their thrash roots.  It's the ideal balance of raw but refined.  The songs are long enough to be fully developed and interesting, but never long just for the sake of being long.  There are details worth noticing all over the place, layered on a primal metal core.<br /><br />Puppets perfects what Metallica first attempted on Ride the Lightening.  It's been 20 years since the album was released, but even today you've got bands trying to catch up with this Master piece.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|More Fall Out Boy? One band that sounds like this is bad enough, who honestly thought a second would make it better. <br />The lyrics are typical emo lyrics, not especially well written and charged with emotion bent on making other people angsty and hating their lives.
0345440900|5.0|My husband and I had originally planned to do the \\"Babywise\\" plan to get our baby on a schedule and sleeping through the night.  However, one night of letting my 2-month-old \\"cry it out\\" until he vomited was the event that told me what I already knew: there has to be a better way.  This book is it. <br /> <br />Tracy's E.A.S.Y. (eat, activity, sleep, \\"you\\" time) scheduling plan, which is not as rigid as Babywise but still works so well, is the basis of this book.  But she also offers loads of great advice about baby care including: teaching my baby to welcome sleep, reading my baby's cues and body language, and how to translate his different kinds of cries.  The interpretation of his body language and crying was in itself priceless information. <br /> <br />Some reviewers said she gives bad breastfeeding advice or that she is slanted toward formula feeding.  I didn't feel that way at all and I exclusively breastfeed my baby.  She recommends feeding only one breast per feeding, and I have tried that.  Seems to work for me most of the time, but sometimes I need to give him both to get enough milk.  Consider her advice for what it's worth but do what works for you.   <br /> <br />Overall, I found that her many years of experience working with babies and parents provided some of the best advice I have read about understanding my baby.  My baby is happy and thriving, has a consistent 3-4 hour schedule, and always knows what to expect when it's sleepytime.  I owe part of it to his temperament, and part of it to implementing the great advice I received from reading this book.
B00005JNRY|5.0|The Bottom Line: Go see CARS!!! Pixar gathered all of the best parts of any its films and jammed them into one great film with the best animation, memorable characters, non-stop action, and heart that defines Pixar films. Go see CARS!!!    I will admit it. I think I am THE world's greatest Pixar fan. I grew up with Pixar. Pixar fostered my early childhood all the way to my teenage years. I know everything about Pixar. Some would even call me obsessed. From each short, to the inside jokes, and to all of the great characters; I've memorized all the best one liners to all of Pixar's films. I've watched each one of the films a million times. I am the best!    Which is exactly what Lightning McQueen, the racecar who thinks he's all that, thinks. After he races in the huge Piston Cup race, but ends up in a three-way tie, Lightning McQueen believes that he will win that Piston Cup. But like all great films, he confronts a problem, getting lost in the town of Radiator Springs and slowly realizing that the Piston Cup is only \\"an empty cup.\\"    It is at Radiator Springs where Lightning learns the importance that it's not about the prize at the end, but the journey that one takes to get to the prize. Cars is a movie about how Route 66 was almost forgotten by the construction of the interstate. It's about knowing that judging others is not the best thing. It's about how people can get away from the rush of city life and enjoy the small town life. Best of all, it is a movie that everybody can enjoy.    The audience cried, they cheered, and they laughed for the characters on screen, because they cared for these characters. At two hours long, Cars is the longest Pixar film so far, but that's too short. Because Cars spends about a quarter of the movie developing the characters, some may say that the film almost stops and doesn't get anywhere, until it speeds up again. Lightning must fix the road that he broke. Along the way, he goes tractor tipping with Mater the tow truck, cruising with Sally the porshe, and competing with Doc Hudson the Hudson Hornet. During the \\"Our Town\\" sequence, I could feel a tear down my cheek and the Pixar folks tugged at my heartstrings. The finale sequence is probably the best finale sequence that Pixar has ever made. Each character introduced has a purpose in the film, and doesn't exist just as an ensemble.    On top of the excellent story, Cars has the best animation, traditional or computer generated, that Pixar films are known for. The vistas look surprisingly real and detailed, especially on the big screen. The reflections, the lighting, and the shading in the characters make the characters realistically stand out from the background. The filmmakers did an excellent job visually making the viewers believe that these cars are living and breathing, having human-like qualities. Each shot of the film is a piece of art, with so much happening on the screen at one point at a time that one only wonders how Pixar did it.    Since Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, Pixar put one instant classic after another, creating and living up to the standard for the future of classic films. And guess what? Pixar has done it again. As a piece of fast-speed and high-quality entertainment, Pixar's Cars is the best fun you'll have all year. You're in for one hell of a ride.      (Here's a little secret for you: Look out for all of the Pixar inside jokes scattered throughout the movie. There's the jackalope from \\"Boundin'\\" on a trailer, the birds from \\"For The Birds\\" on a telephone pole, the Pizza Planet Truck behind the announcers, and if you stay to the very, very end of the credits, you'll get a surprise from the Pixar folks.)
B00000F6LQ|4.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies to quote and the added screenplay has made me even more dangerous.  This is not a remastered version and I don't know if there is one, so that was a disappointment, but that has to be my only complaint on this DVD.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Not having been a fan of Johnny Cash my entire life, I didn't have any of his life details to compare while watching the movie.  I had no idea about his relationship with June Carter, or really any of his hit songs.  That being said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  The portrait that Joaquin Phoenix paints of the classic singer is a troubled man who battled some of the usual demons that people in the spotlight often fight.  Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.  Most of these things, like always are self imposed, and should be avoided.  It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world. <br /> <br />Anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.  She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.  The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.  Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.  She is always watchable in her movies and this was no exception. <br /> <br />In short, I liked the film.  Not a movie I plan on watching repeatedly, but it was worth the time to see.  I recommend it highly, even if like me, you know little or nothing about the singer.  This film is worth the time invested.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Wow! This is not only Eminem's best album, this album should be in any rap fan's prized classic CD collection. This is the CD that started a revolution. It turned people that hated rap into rap fans, and it turned some rap fans into rap haters. It's simply because this rap album is just so different from most. From the disturbing but completely dope lyrics on \\"Kill You\\" (serial killer hiding murder material in a cereal box on top of your stereo) to the hilarious lyrics on \\"Criminal\\" (Hate ***s? The answer's yes!), the album not only upholds Eminem's lyrics on \\"The Slim Shady LP\\", but it murders them and sets a new bar for rappers to abide to. My personal favorites on the album are:  <br />Kill You- Straight up completely demented and weird.  <br />Stan- Sad story of a crazy fan.  <br />Who Knew- Funny as hell.  <br />The Way I Am- Menacing threat to his obsessive fans.   <br />The Real Slim Shady- Funny, especially the line about Will Smith.  <br />Remember Me?- Kinda scary-sounding.   <br />Marshall Mathers- Good lines on ICP.  <br />Amityville- Bizarre's verse talks about raping his cousin and getting his friends to rape his sister at her sixth birthday party. Enough said.  <br />B***h Please II- Great cameos.  <br />Kim- Sick, disgusting and twisted song. It sent shudders throughout my body when he yells \\"bleed, bleed.\\"  <br />Criminal- Pretty funny.
B000268QB2|5.0|Tom Chaplin has a soaring, emotional voice which hits the spot every time.  Tim Rice-Oxley's piano is influenced by Coldplay but that is beside the point - their songs stand on their own.  Somewhere Only We Know is an amazing example of emotional songwriting and the rest of the album does not disappoint.  There are lots of great songs on this album.  Who care if there are no guitars?  You don't miss them, not when the musicians are this good.

0156030306|4.0|Flowers for Algernon is a book that will send you on an emotional roller coaster. Bitterness, anger, sadness and happiness are just some of the few emotions that this book sucks out of you. I never knew what it like to be in the shoes of someone of low intelligence, but this book helped opened my eyes and made me realize that retarded people also want to accepted and fit into society just like everyone else. When Charlie, a mentally retarded adult, gets an operation to make him genius, he begins to realize not only what the world thought of him, but began understand the amount of torment and pain he experienced without ever knowing it. Reading this book made me question to what point men can succeed in trying to deceive nature from she has worked so hard to produce. This was a very absorbing novel that would appeal to people of all ages as it address issues that range from showing a sense of brotherhood to all people, all the way to questioning if what happened to Charlie was a result of divine intervention to show men their bounds. The only con for me was that the book did tend to drag at times and didn't move fast enough. But if you keep at it till the end, it's a very thought provoking book because just when you think you have it all figured out, there is always some other issue that denies your mind the easy answers it seeks.
0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson thoroughly deserved the Oscar she received for her adaptation.  Her love for the novel and respect for Austen's art is obvious. Nothing significant is missing, and all changes stay true to the spirit and meaning of the book.      My only real complaint about the production is that, while Emma Thompson played an excellent Elinor, she was at least 10 years too old for the part.  There were times when her Elinor and Margaret looked more like mother and daughter than two sisters.    However, I think that the rest of the casting was spot-on.  Elizabeth Spriggs and Robert Hardy as Mrs. Jennings and Sir Middleton made an excellent team and Imogen Stubbs captured Lucy perfectly.  I think that Emilie Francois as Margaret was particularly well cast; it can be difficult to find good child actors, and she was very believable and not a bit precocious.    There aren't oodles of extras, but the ones that are present are worth viewing, and they make up in quality what they lack in quantity.      This movie would make an excellent addition to your DVD collection.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is a movie that will survive time and is destined to become a classic.  It tells the tale of love, heartbreak, and complex family (& societal) relationships.  The acting is superb, especially an easily emotionally-connective Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams (as the strong wife, Alma).  The movie is beautifully shot and very enjoyable for the scenery as well as the story and acting.  When society catches up with this movie on its sexuality level, it will still be relevant because it will always be a classic well-done love story.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I'm another devotee of the 1995 BBC production of P&P but I looked forward to this very much.  I accept that this shorter version can only hope to catch the flavour of Austen's work and I never expected that it would follow the novel slavishly.  However, here is what I liked and did not like:<br /><br />I liked most of the production values - the settings were wonderful and it was great that Chatsworth House was used for Pemberley.  The costumes and hairdressing were good:  not at all artificial and probably very much portrayed life in the 1790s (when the novel was actually written) - people sweat, the ladies' hairdos come undone.  The assembly and ballroom dancing scenes were well done and the room they were set in was wonderful.  The photography was excellent and the music charming.  There were some continuity errors, however, that are pretty annoying; others here have pointed them out.<br /><br />I did not like:  Matthew MacFayden came across as shy and immature rather than proud and the master of a huge and wealthy landed estate.  He just did not ring true; he seemed to be floundering around in both his own and Elizabeth's worlds.  Mr Bingley, Simon Woods, came across as androgenous to me - in fact I wondered if he was a cross dresser at times.  He was so annoying - I just could not see how the local belle, Jane, could find him even remotely attractive.  Yuck! And, finally, Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett:  No, No, No, No, No, No.  The casting, probably a sop to the US audience, was completely ridiculous.  And the scruffy beard????  I think Austen meant him to be a little more refined and sophisticated than the gentleman farmer we see chasing pigs through the kitchen.<br /><br />Silliness:  A complete waste of Dame Judi Dench.  What was Lady Catherine doing visiting the Bennetts in the middle of the night?<br /><br />Nonetheless, it's still P&P and worth watching although I think I need to revive myself with the Firth/Ehle version again before I view this once more.

Bajo Fondo Tango Club is not as pure tango as Piazzola's nor as chill out percolated as Gotan Project's, which makes them a band for all publics.

0060763280|1.0|If you've read Life 101, anything by Stuart Wilde, David Bach's recent bestseller, Rich Dad Poor Dad, or Think And Grow Rich, you already know everything in this book.  Eker took other people's information and compiled it into this book (and on CD, and made little affirmation cards, ad nauseum).

B0002IQEHI|5.0|CLASSIC CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY'S WORST CASE SCENARIO --- MAKES A BEST CASE CLASSIC FILM <br />      <br />JUST WHAT IS \\"NORTH BY NORTHWEST\\" - A COMEDY? THRILLER? DRAMA? LOVE STORY or FARCE?  <br /> <br />Answer - It doesn't matter, because, North-By-Northwest is one of the most purely entertaining and compelling films ever produced, and it is readily available on a fully-featured, remastered, widescreen DVD.  <br /> <br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT - - THE $4,000,000 BARGAIN OF 1959!  <br /> <br />Mistaken identity is taken about as far afield as it can go, with some wrinkles thrown in, like murder, attempted murder, love, betrayal, and plot twists on plot twists. Add to this, the pace of this film really books!  <br /> <br />THE HITCHCOCK TRADEMARK TAKES CENTER-STAGE: GOOD GUY WITH A FLAW - ENTER R.O.T.  <br /> <br />Just like Janet Leigh's character in \\"Psycho\\" and James Stewart's character in \\"Vertigo\\", the hero in \\"North-By-Northwest\\" has a character flaw that's going to cost him big. In Roger O. Thornhill's case he makes a living by capricious, harmless \\"exaggeration\\". He is in advertising and in this movie everything that happens to him seems like sensationalism, hyperbole, misrepresentation, stretching the truth, a whopper, overkill, and a lot of bull. All of which are synonyms for \\"exaggeration\\", how R.O.T. describes his occupation to put a fine point on it. The effect of this kind of literary justice is to put R.O.T. in a position where he must examine his soul and decide to take a position rather than a viewpoint. In doing this, he reaches a well-earned epiphany for both himself and his patient audience. In the end, his life is not only restored but is new and improved, as they say in advertising, with Eva Marie Saint becoming Mrs. Thornhill as his reward for sincere caring and many unselfish acts. In the end, goodness becomes more than its own reward as it can only be counted on in fiction: ah, but such good fiction was this.  <br /> <br />THE SETS - -  <br /> <br />North-By-Northwest was filmed on many locations in the United States and made to look like many more. There are memorable scenes in the United Nations in New York, Chicago, Mount Rushmore and even on Long Island, not to mention on the train with Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant from New York to Chicago. There are On-Location shots and matte backgrounds depicting outdoor sets filmed in Hollywood at MGM. Many of the interesting and unusual sets are explained in the featurette, all of which are well done and are very useful and important to the film's realism, which remains surprisingly intact throughout all the permutations in the plot and scenery.  <br /> <br />NICE SOUNDTRACK - - <br /> <br />LET'S NOT FORGET THE MARVELOUSLY DARK SOUNDTRACK by Bernard Herrmann which made long scenes like Grant's drunk-driving fiasco seem tense rather than tedious.  <br /> <br />THE ACTORS - -  <br /> <br />Cary Grant is Roger O. Thornhill, or is that George Kaplan? You'll have to see the film to know for sure. His mother, Clara Thornhill, played by Jesse Royce Landis, isn't even sure, it seems, when Grant's life has been hijacked apparently without cause. James Mason as Phillip Vandamm is the unconventional leader of an international spy ring that has just marked Cary Grant for death. Unfortunately for Grant, but fortunately for us, he has little in common with most action heros so his solutions are also a little unconventional and more sophisticated than the usual Hollywood hero's.  <br /> <br />The result is fast-paced action entertainment that keeps the large, experienced cast of Hollywood veterans quite busy and the audience guessing.  <br /> <br />Cary Grant - Roger O. Thornhill  <br />Eva Marie Saint - Eve Kendall  <br />James Mason - Phillip Vandamm  <br />Jesse Royce Landis - Clara Thornhill  <br />Leo G. Carroll - The Professor  <br />Martin Landau - Leonard  <br />Philip Ober - Lester Townsend  <br />Josephine Hutchinson - \\"Mrs. Townsend,\\" housekeeper  <br />Adam Williams - Valerian  <br />Edward Platt - Victor Larrabee  <br />Robert Ellenstein - Licht  <br />Les Tremayne - Auctioneer  <br />Philip Coolidge - Dr. Cross  <br />Patrick McVey - Chicago Policeman  <br />Edward Binns - Capt. Junket  <br />Alfred Hitchcock - Man Who Misses Bus  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE DVD - - <br /> <br />This excellent transfer comes with the following;  <br /> <br />DVD Features:  <br />Available Subtitles: English, French  <br />Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), French (Dolby Digital 1.0)  <br /> <br />Commentary by: screenwriter Ernest Lehman -- Somewhat dry and not really coordinated with what is happening on screen but it is, after all, comments by the screenwriter so it is worth listening to at least once if you are interested.  <br /> <br />Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest, with host Eva Marie Saint, Martin Landau, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, Patricia Hitchcock and others. This is a somewhat interesting 40-minute featurette, the high point of which is Martin Landau doing an excellent impression of Hitchcock during minute 28 of the 40-minute featurette.  <br /> <br />Music-only track: Music-only audio track showcasing Bernard Herrmann's score, Stills gallery, Hitchcock trailer gallery plus Widescreen anamorphic and full-screen formats! Not bad for $8.00!  <br /> <br />IN THE END - -  <br /> <br />Without a doubt, \\"North-By-Northwest\\" is my favorite Hitchcock film. For me, it is the Hitchcock film that stands up best to nearly a half century of repeated viewings. \\"NORTH BY NORTHWEST\\" is a case of the right men [Hitchcock & Grant] making a most entertaining 'Wrong Man' film.
0552150266|5.0|<br /> This book does an excellent job of describing two chaotic battles in a very organized fashion.  The authors are well acquainted with the subject matter as they both lived through the events described in the book.  Harold Moore was the Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry.  Joseph Galloway was a reporter for United Press International.  The authors also did a lot of homework.  The \\"Acknowledgments\\" section indicated that they spent ten years doing research for this book.  The clarity with which the book is written indicates that this time was well spent.  In addition to conducting extensive research in the U.S., they also traveled to Vietnam and interviewed several of the North Vietnamese leaders who fought against them.  This research allowed them to describe the battles from both sides. <br /> <br /> The first part of the book describes the Battle of LZ X-Ray.  The early stages of this battle were very chaotic.  The authors, however, were able to clearly describe the events in a chronological and easy to understand manner.  This process is then repeated for the Battle of LZ Albany.  The end result is an easy read. <br /> <br /> This book is also an excellent supplement for anyone who watched the Mel Gibson movie.  Events in the movie are sometimes confusing.  This book does an excellent job of clarifying many of the troop movements.  The maps alone are invaluable in describing how the battles unfolded.  Bottom line: although this is a factually accurate history book, it reads like an adventure novel.  Any reader will clearly see why it was selected by the Commandant of the Marine Corps as his choice book for 1993.
0767802659|2.0|Millions for special effects but not a dime for intelligence script!  It's a shame that in a war against gigantic intelligent insects the humans must be cast as people with IQ's of less than 80.  In almost every battle scene in the movie one wonders if there is an inter-planetary treaty limiting the use of advanced weaponry.  Military hardware such as the Abrams M1 A1 tank, armor piercing ammunition, or even good old-fashioned insecticide or poison gas, are apparently unknown to the human military geniuses. The starship captains who transport the troopers to the bug planets are in desperate need of Captain Kirk.  The starships, which can apparently travel hundreds of light years in a few days are apparently powerless to defend themselves when orbiting a bug planet.  The starships seem to lumber in slow motion as the \\"bug plasma\\", which is shot at them, rips them apart.  They definitely could have used the Star Trek Engineer Scotty to get them some warp drive, impulse power, or defensive shielding to avoid being destroyed.  The only military tactic that made any sense is when thousands of arachnids were napalmed by air power.  It is also amazing that many science fiction scripts are written with a total disregard of basic physics or interstellar mechanics.  The arachnids main weapon against Earth are large meteors.  The arachnids shoot these meteors toward Earth from a star system hundreds of light years away without any explanation of how they are sent.  Without a warm hole or stargate how do they get here?  The script writers could have spent more time on the science and eliminated the soap-opera-like love affair that wasted movie time.  I rated the movie two stars solely for the realistic special effects.  The arachnids were realistic and very well done along with the battle sequences.  The starships and other space models were very well detailed and top-of-the-line.  It still amazed me that a movie with such top-quality special effects paid such little attentionto obtaining a script that incorporated logical military tactics and scientific knowledge.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Well I wasn't expecting much from this movie when my wife brought it home.  I had seen the trailers for it and it looked like a movie with no kind of plot and just sheer torture scenes.  At first it looked as if I was right about the plot as the entire first half of the movie is like soft-core porn(there are some pretty hot ladies in this by the way) and the second half at first seems to be just gratuitous torture, dismembering, etc.  But watch a little longer and keep an open mind and there is an actual plot.  The movie isn't scary in the classic sense of being afraid to turn out the lights or to go outside after dark but scary and disturbing in the sense that there could quite possibly be some sick, bored and wealthy people paying to do this to people somewhere in the world, maybe even here in the USA.  The last time I felt as disturbed after watching a movie as I did after Hostel was Seven.  Difference is Seven didn't show the actual deeds being done, Hostel does.  There also seems to be sort of a social commentary running in the background.  The tourists are interested in blowing there money on weed and sex to get their kicks, while at the same time the wealty men who have gotten bored with being able to have any luxury they want are blowing there money on people to torture and murder to get their kicks.  Also it's interesting to note that the Americans bring a higher price since they seem to be in higher demand to kill.  I want say this is a great movie but better than expected.  If you're squemish you will probably want to stay away as there are a few scenes that are kinda hard to watch.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers-Californication *****<br /><br />The largely anticipated Californication was released in 1999 and while that doesn't seem that long ago this album holds up very well. Like I said 1999 doesn't seem that far behind but when you think about it 1998-1999 was really the second coming of the late 1970's in the since that almost all of the music was not bearable. Californication was probably the best album to come out that year. The return of \\"THE\\" Red Hot Chili Peppers. Dave Navarro is a great guitar player but it doesn't seem right with out John. Hillel was amazing but it doesn't seem right with out John. The classic line up John Frusciante, Anthony Kiedis, Chad Smith, and Flea came back together to create what I think will be a feature classic if it isn't already.<br /><br />The album starts off with `Around The World' which was a hit for the band and is still played on the radio regularly. It's loud, fast, and at times in your face, and its one hell of a way to open the album. Then we jump right into `Parallel Universe' which is a song that really speaks for it's self. It must be heard to appreciate because it is really all over the place and it is a really great song. Anthony's vocals are fantastic. Next is the song that got me as well as many other fans into the band. Its my all time favorite Chili Peppers song, `Scar Tissue.' The whole thing is magical. This song came along when I was starting to play guitar and John's solo on this song couldn't have been better or more inspirational. Anthony's vocals and lyrics make this song irresistible. Chad Smith's and Flea held back bass lines drumming compliment perfectly. The backing vocals give me chills, no other word comes to mind other then perfection. Dark and scary are really the only way I can describe `Otherside.' The first time I heard this song was at two in the morning and the haunting backing music to Anthony's dark lyrics just scared the hell out of me, and I loved every minute of it. This is truly one of the best songs the band has ever made, and maybe that they will ever make. `Get On Top' is very cool very BloodSugarSexMagik, very Mothers Milk. Next is the title track, The ingenious `Californication' which has the coolest and most mind blowing premise for a song ever! Smiths drumming and Fleas bass lay down a rhythm section fit for kings. John's guitar riffs and solo bring this song to life. Kiedis' vocals are the most amazing he has ever written and in my opinion the best and most creative he will ever write, he is a genius. `Easily' isn't my favorite song on album but it is still a very good song and not one you want to skip. `Porcelain' is one of the most beautiful song the Peppers have ever recorded. `Emit Remmus' is a cool song and very heavy for the Chili Peppers. One of my favorites on the album. `I Like Dirt' aside from being sort of strange is very good and contains some great Hendrix inspired guitar playing by John which really makes the song if you ask me, killer solo. Finally the acoustic ballad. I live for the Peppers' slow acoustic songs they do them perfect and `This Velvet Glove' is no exception. It starts out slow and acoustic only to build to a climactic electric end. Great song. `Savior' is wild. It's all over the place. It's up its down, its fast its slow, it's also one great song. `Purple Stain' is a great song, one of the best on the album. This is one you can tell that came very easy to them it's very simple and yet so good. This is one song I think everyone would like. `Right On Time' is nice because it's half early Chili Peppers and half current Chili Peppers. I think This would have been better on BloodSugarSexMagik but it fits in nice here too. The album comes to a end with a acoustic `Road Trippin' which is a fantastic way to end the album nice and easy. It was a sign of things to come as By The Way as a whole sounds much like this song. What a great end to a great album<br /><br />So to say that Californication is the greatest Red Hot Chili Peppers album would be incorrect. Close but no cigar. It is however a wonderful album with many things to offer even the most stubborn of listeners and for that it does deserve an applause. The Peppers ended the millennium the right way, on top. So to everyone reading this, I highly recommend it.s the greatest Red Hot Chili Peppers album would be incorrect. Close but no cigar.

B00009W0WM|5.0|The AFI considers Casablanca as the #2 movie of all time after Citizen Kane, though I personally rank it #1.  The masterpiece is preeminent in movie making with a stellar cast and unescapable zeal that infuses the story.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam *****<br /><br />Truly one of the all time best to come from Pearl Jam. I have been listening to these guys for a very long time now. In my opinion this is a band that has never made a bad album in their career and probably never will. Since the start I have been one of those saying that Pearl Jam would never again make and album better then their masterpiece Ten, they might come close but never top it. Close but no cigar. Well not only did they top Ten with this album but in my opinion they blew it away. This is to me the very best album Pearl Jam has ever made and Im not sure they will be able to top it in the future.<br /><br />This is Eddie Vedders album. They lyrics are young and inspired like they were ten, fifteen years ago. His vocals are angst filled and full of hurt and life at the same time. He really came alive on this album like he hasn't in years, he really proved his worth as one of rock and roll all time best frontmen.<br /><br />Stone Gossard and Mike Mccready's guitar playing is at its all time best. Playing crafty solos and power chords from hell. They really show what a great guitar duo they are, and how underrated they are. Matt Cameron and Jeff Ament lay down the foundation for one hell of a rhythm section.<br /><br />Song like the powerful opener `Life Wasted' and the killer lead single `World Wide Suicide' set the pace for the album. These songs really are going to show the world that no, Pearl Jam is not dead in fact they are back in full form and ready to rock and roll. These hard rockers have a message and they are gonna preach it. Sometimes loud, aggravated, and even crude at times the songs are full of aggression which really comes across in the harder rock songs, and its wonderful. It's something I have been waiting for from Pearl Jam for years.<br /><br />The slower acoustic songs like `Parachutes' `Gone' and `Come Back' my be less intense and less in your face but the message is no less their. These songs are still very powerful. Though Vedders lyrics seem less inspired in these songs as well as his vocals this takes nothing away from the songs as a whole they are still very good I just think the rockers make the album.<br /><br />As a whole this is really best the band has to offer. Hard rock is what the band does best, its what they grew up on and its what they should continue to make. This is one album I would highly recommend to all rock fans of any sort.very powerful.

B000078DOI|4.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers-Mothers Milk ****<br /><br />Incredible guitar riffs, syncopated drumming, and out of this world bass playing. What more could you want from a rock band? Maybe real vocals from the frontman/lead singer. Look I love Anthony Keidis, he is one of the greatest frontmen in all of rock and roll history but he hadn't found his niche as one of the greatest vocalist's ever. Mothers Milk was the first death after the death of original guitarist Hillel Slovak and the first with new drummer Chad Smith and with the genius guitar of John Frushanti. The band was just now starting to find themselfs on this album. Before they just wanted to be a funk band but here they found a way to mix the funk and soul with hard rock to create one of the greatest lineups in rock history. This was a very important album in Chili Peppers history indeed.<br /><br />The album opens with the fun hard rocker `Good Time Boys' which was a great way to start the record. The riff is one of the best that John ever created and the chorus is very good as well, very catchy. `Higher Ground' is a Stevie Wonder cover which the band absolutely owns. I love Stevie but the boys tore this song apart and completely made it their own. Powerful vocals and a great bass line made this an instant classic not to mention the first Chili Peppers track to get real recognition. `Subway To Venus' is well exactly the reason why this album is only getting four stars. It is great musically but the vocal delivery is less then great. Keidis was still at the point where he would not sing just rap really, which is good for a while it is good for a while it does get a little annoying. Also his lyrics are a little sub par here. But the song isn't that bad it just gets old after too many listens. But Fleas horns are great. Im sorry but `Magic Johnson' is just straight up annoying and gets on my nerves every time I hear it. `Nobody Weird Like Me' is a great song, in fact it is one of the best on the album. The bass line maybe Fleas all time best. It drives the whole song and Smith's drums follow the bass perfectly. John's guitar is fantastic as well. Anthony's vocals are pretty good here and his lyrics are very good as well. The bridge is fantastic as well. `Knock Me Down' is classic Red Hot Chili Peppers. One of their all time best. This song as well as Higher Ground showed the direction they would be moving in with this album better then any other tracks. It's more just straight up rock and roll instead of funk while still not losing that edge or soul. As far as the album goes Anthony's lyrics are best here and his vocals are best here too. Once again the whole song is based around Fleas bass line. `Taste The Pain' is a little slower and a little better then most of the other songs on the album. More thought went behind this song I feel and it really shows because this is a excellent song. `Stone Cold Bush' is another Peppers classic. A live favorite and a tune adored by all fans. Very cool guitar riff. The lyrics and the melody and the delivery by Anthony reminds me of late 80's Steven Tyler, just less vocally powerful. Next is another cover by and even more legendary artist. `Fire' by Jimi Hendrix, who was a major influence on the Peppers, especially John. The bands version is great, and while not better then the original like Higher Ground this is very original. The bass is turned up and it is made into a punk song. Very good and very enjoyable. `Pretty Little Ditty' is just John playing around on his guitar for a few minutes and it is very calm and beautiful. This track alone inspired countless guitarists. `Punk Rock Classic' is a punk song done in Chili Pepper fashion and done well. `Sexy Mexican Maid' is a great song and it is one of my favorites on the album, and really one of my favorites that the band has ever made. The album comes to a close with `Johnny, Kick A Hole In The Sky' which is alright nothing too special about it. The lyrics have one rhyme scheme. The album would have ended better with Sexy Mexican Maid.<br /><br />What's great about this album is the new remasterd version which features bonus tracks and out takes as well as two other Hendrix covers `Crosstown Traffic' and `Castles Made Of Sand' I recommend that version because it is longer and is amazing.<br /><br />To conclude this is a fantastic record. While not the best Chili Peppers album you will hear but it is still one that should be heard. One thing is for sure your Red Hot Chili Peppers collection is not complete with out this album. Recommended to all who are interested.album would have ended better with Sexy Mexican Maid. <br />What's great about this album is the new remasterd version which features bonus tracks and out takes as well as two other Hendrix covers `Crosstown Traffic' and `Castles Made Of Sand' I recommend that version because it is longer and is amazing. <br /> <br />To conclude this is a fantastic record.

B000F0UUIM|4.0|Warner's newly restored and remastered version of the 1956 John Ford-John Wayne masterpiece finally brings home the film in an approximation of its original theatrical glory. Colors are remarkable, and images seem complete. Owners of previous versions should upgrade without hesitation.<br /><br />Peter Bogdanovich, the dependable (and prolific) DVD commentator, says \\"The Searchers\\" is \\"as good a Western as Ford made, maybe the best.\\" \\"It's amazing how it was overlooked in its day,\\" Bogdanovich says.<br /><br />Directors Martin Scorsese, Curtis Hanson and John Milius participate in a half-hour appreciation included as a DVD extra. All three dwell on the dark side of the film, whose treacherous crosscurrents include rape, sexual slavery, the slaughter of innocents, Old Testament vengeance and omnipresent racism. Few films burrow so deep into the audience's primal places. Even today, after viewing the restored film, Scorsese finds it \\"very disturbing.\\"<br /><br />New-to-DVD extra features are the Bogdanovich commentary, a needless introduction by Patrick Wayne and the excellent half-hour \\"An Appreciation.\\" Ported over from previous videos are the jittery Ken Burns-like docu \\"A Turning of the Earth\\" (Milius narrates) and a handful of \\"Behind the Cameras\\" TV puff pieces from 1956 with Gig Young. Warner had no alternate takes or deleted scenes to display, typical of the efficient Ford, Bogdanovich says.<br /><br />\\"The Searchers\\" comes in two double-disc sets with identical content on the DVDs. The \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" adds only print materials, including reproductions of the 1956 tie-in comic and the original press book, along with some unremarkable memos and postcards.<br /><br />There is a good deal of repetitive material in the extras for this title and some of the other Wayne-Ford releases -- images, clips, stories -- but most viewers won't mind. Unfortunately, there's nothing on the music in Ford's films, such as Max Steiner's score for \\"The Searchers.\\"
B000FFJ85I|5.0|After a 3 year hiatus from the scene, AFI returns!!! To many of the fans out there that were unaware of AFI prior to 2003's \\"Sing The Sarrow\\", this album is slightly reminsient of older tracks like some of those from the album \\"The Art of Drowning\\", however the melodic tunes expressed on this record is much more grown up and enjoyable. I have loved AFI since 1996 and their first shows back when they were playing with Rancid. NOW...many of the \\"hardcore\\" fans think that \\"DecemberUnderground\\" is too slow...or whatever..However I think that this just an excellent band with excellent song-writers expressing a differnt outlook, & a different range of emotions. You know that if every band constantly put records that sounded the same all the time...we listeners would become bored really quick!! <br /> <br />As for my opinions of the record: <br />I absolutly love, love, love #10-The Killing Lights & the lyrics, \\"am i beatiful / am i usuable\\" really stuck with me. & it has to be my favorite song on the record!!! <br />I also have to say that #11-37MM is perhaps the most melodic song and the best produced. As for the current single #3-Miss Murder I think that it is a wonderful move towards the older side of AFI circa 1997 and so is #2-Kill Caustic which is the bands next offical single...I cant wait to see what this video will be like!! <br /> <br />The only negative thing I have to say is its a shame that we had to wait so long for this record...but i guess good things come to those who wait!  <br /> <br /> <br />As for buying this record...I pre-ordered this one and I am now going to purchase the UK IMPORT, b/c theres a great cover of the NIN's hit \\"head like a hole\\" which i worth owning for all of you that watched the MTV ICON...its an awsome track!! Totally worth buying!!
0143034901|5.0|This is the best novel that I have read in a long time. I throughly enjoyed the story, the premise, the characters, the descriptions --everything!<br /><br />It was my turn to pick a selection for our book club. I typically pick something I have read recently, but nothing was coming to mind this time. So I narrowed my list to six books, then three. I decided to read the first 100 pages of each of those three. The first one was uninspiring and the second was too much like many books we have already read.  I picked up Shadow of the Wind to read just the first 100 pages. But I never got a chance to put it down. The book consumed my weekend. I concur with other reviewers who were disappointed when the book ended -- I will miss my time with Daniel, Julian and their friends!<br /><br />I cannot wait to hear what the other members of my bookclub think. This was the best book I have read all year!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|i wasnt a fan of afi until i heard sing the sorrow, and it took me a lot of listens to actually enjoy the album. now with decmberunderground released i have to say\\"wake up\\". yes the cd is a little slower than sing the sorrow, but it is still a great cd. im a definate believer in afi's ability to write good music and look forward to what else they're gonna release in the future
B00006WUWQ|4.0|Ok, the first movie is a comedic masterpiece, witty and bawdy.  Meaning the funniest parts are the dirtiest parts. The second movie thought, \\"The dirtier, the funnier\\" which, to me, was not the case.  It got dirtier and less funny.  The final movie, Goldmember got its act together a little. It had dirty parts and funny parts, but not together.
B000F48CD8|2.0|The biggest oxymoron ever written in a public fora. Those who praise J.W.'s musical talent obviously have never seen a music theory book in their lives! 'Tis shamefull and even disgraceful that so many folks actually believe guitar-banging, poor-voiced hacks like these guys are good musicians. <br />I'm all for new genras, new styles, etc.; however, Raconteurs are neither a new style nor a new genra. They are simply put mediocre musicians aspiring to engage their young and perhaps naive audience with tried-and-true, time-tested beats with some half-way decent vocals to create a so-called album. <br />This album has only one use: entertain yourself for about half an hour, then use it as a beverage coaster.
B0000524CY|5.0|If you've never seen THE EXORCIST, or haven't seen it in a long time, this is a great opportunity to add this classic horror film to your library!<br /><br />The acting, directing, cinematography, sound track and special effects all stand up well to the test of time.  Of special note is that both the special effects and the Tubular Bells music are still wonderful, not at all \\"period.\\" Max von Sydow is also particularly memorable as Father Merrin.<br /><br />The plot involves the possession of a 12-year-old girl by an ancient demon (is there any other kind).  Murder, a doubting priest, and a celebrity mom are tossed into the mix.  It's as chilling and realistic as you remember.<br /><br />Of special note- this DVD edition has about a dozen minutes of cutting room floor footage--and it's good stuff.  It was omitted back in the day when films were usually limited to two hours.  The staircase descent is particularly memorable, not to give away too much.
0156030306|4.0|Charlie, the main character in Flowers For Algernon, was born retarded. He goes to Beekman University to be a part of a study to make retarded people smart. Through the book Charlie goes through many challenges. These events make the reader think a lot about their life for many ways. Though out the book, you get an inside view of a retarded person and the struggles they go though even if they don't know it. I think that in parts the book goes slow, but in a way it makes you want to read on just for the exciting event. I personally have worked with mentally retard people and I think that this book shows real life problems that they go though everyday. This book is very powerful, you need to be al least eighth grade student to understand the book fully. This doesn't mean it is not for adults. A lot of adults and kids should read this, because it give them insight in to a world that they would never be able to imagin.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|I attended the recording of this cd. In my opinion, her style is suited for just this kind of treatment. For that person who said that she was offended by that line in \\"Unbreakable\\", I think you are taking it waaay to seriously. Truth is, they did fight. Tina dealth with it as long as she could and then said, \\"enough\\". Anyway, my favorite track, has to be, \\"Stolen Moments\\". When she performed it that night, my jaw just dropped. She is the Carol King, Janis Ian, and Roberta Flack for the new generation....
0312965788|5.0|All Creatures Great and Small was a wonderful book, definitely one of my favorites.  It was about animals, which was what drew me to the book to begin with.  The book draws you in, not really in a suspenseful way, but in a way that makes you just want to keep reading.  Also, James Herriot tells wonderful stories and is willing to make fun of himself and situations he was in, some of which were his fault.  It was fun getting to experience his first few years as a country vet along with him.  You also get to witness his relationships with animals and the people around him.  Plus, all the characters are realistic and you believe all the situations that they are in.<br /><br /> Even though there were a lot of good things about this book, there were also a few things that I did not like.  The author was Scottish and he lived in Yorkshire so some of the language was kind of confusing and often you had to guess at what the words meant.  In the beginning it was a little confusing, because usually each chapter talks about a different event in the authors life, but as you read you get used to that.  Also, some parts of the book could get kind of long and repetitive, but most parts kept your attention quite well.  Overall, I though it was a very, very good book that I would definitely recommend.
B000002N1E|5.0|'The Gold Experience' was recorded during Prince's bitter feaud with Warner Brothers,in which he chose to begin referring to himself as O(-> (or the Artist Formerly Known As Prince).This was the first release credited only to that symbol,the first popular artist to refer to himself as something other then a written name.That indulgance aside this CD is a return to form from the rather lacking Prince albums just before.The same modern elements of hip-hop and harder rock are still there but more focused and well performed,not tacked on.The album itself plays like a computer program with every other of the 18 cuts being the voice of the NPG operator explaining the 'feel' of the upcoming song.'P Control' is one of the better examples of Prince being able to successfully integrate rap and hard funk and since both are presented in tough,driving fasion it works.Like much of the material here it is very politcal-in terms of music,race,sex and social status.This ends up basically being one half rock and another half funk.Of course \\"Endorphinmachine\\",\\"Shh\\",\\"We March\\" and the fabulous \\"Dolphin\\" are great rock songs-some poppier the some harder edged.Prince pulls some crazy guitar solo's and riffs out of left fiend and really commits himself to the music entirely.Of the funky tunes the ripping \\"319\\",\\"Now\\",the haunting \\"Shy\\" and the back to basics \\"Billy Jack Bitch\\" all assault you with rhythm.The three most powerful songs are two fabulous epics-the rock hysteria of \\"Gold\\" and the soulful \\"Eye Hate U\\".The next one (and the biggest hit from the album) is the catchy ballad \\"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\\"-it is very gentle,humane and beautiful-the flowering of a fully mature Prince.No matter what he's playing-rock,funk,pop,hip hop or some unique hybrid in between Prince is always Prince and always has his own distinct style to go on in each style he chooses to explore.And although often neglected this was the beginning of a whole new beginning for O(-> and his music.There were many times where quality slipped,such as right after this but it never last too long.This deserves to be revisited.There were many times where quality slipped,such as right after this but it never last too long.This deserves to be revisited.
B0002OERI0|5.0|In 1995, Green Day had 2 great records, Dookie & Insomniac. Having said that, 1997 disappointed me. Nimrod was just okay, but nothing special. Same case for 2001's Warning:, just okay. But, in 2004, the story changed. American Idiot is one of the best records I've ever heard. Billie Joe Armstrong sings great punk, and this record reminded me of one thing: Green Day is the best punk band since The Clash, The Ramones & The Sex Pistols.     But, Green Day built on its punk roots and wove rock and pop sounds in for good measure.  Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Letterbomb and Wake Me Up When September Ends feature some inspired punk-pop combinations, by no means a marriage that ought to work. But Green Day has mastered the genre and has made it hight art with these great songs.      She's A Rebel & American Idiot are my favorites on this record, but it's very hard to pick a favorite. These songs are all creative, intense musical expressions. Great sound too - wonderfully mixed by Chris Lord-Alge.     Whether you agree or disagree with the direction our country is headed in, American Idiot (the entire record) will at least raise some questions in your mind and make you think.      Green Day hopefully will put out more of this music, because it's inspired songwriting and top notch rock/punk/pop music.  In a word, a masterpiece. You must buy it.

B000FFJ85I|5.0|This is AFI's most sophisticated and mature album they've ever made.  It is their best.  Their brilliance.  Every song crafts excellent guitar, superb singing, loud drums (not heard much on Sing the Sorrow) and driving bass along with a new suprise never heard so much on any AFI album.  Syth-pop.  Don't get angered when I say pop, think The Cure, Depheche Mode, or Alphaville, that kind of electronica.   <br /> <br />It has some of AFI's heaviest tracks ever created: <br /> <br />Kill Caustic (Davey's best screams) <br />Miss Murder (their closest sounding song to rock-n-roll) <br />Summer Shudder (really loud) <br />Afliction (full of awesome riffs and a really cool electronica part at the end) <br />Kiss and Control (you'll be suprised) <br />Endlessly, She Said (truely amazing, both epic and heavy, a build-up...) <br /> <br />Also some of their most epic songs: <br /> <br />The Interview (hands down, one of their best songs ever written) <br />The Missing Frame (has that really good U2 feel) <br />The Killing Lights (think of a reincarnate This Celluloid Dream, great guitar too) <br /> <br />And some of their strangest songs: <br /> <br />Prelude 12/21 (you would NOT expect this to be an opener, but it really fits) <br />Love Like Winter (just as poppy and upbeat as Girl's Not Grey, but more colder....) <br />37mm (an incredible electronic song... Silver and Cold allusions, Strenth Through Wounding also, it is just so goddammed weird.) <br /> <br />This is a new AFI and if you are willing to accept them, accepting great music, take it, get it, and run.  If you want Sing the Sorrow, pt. II, get the hell away thinking they would repeat themselves.
B000002HRE|3.0|3.5 stars  I'm a really big fan of Metallica. I have all their CDs and DVDs and I play almost all their old stuff with my band. My two favourite albums of all time are MOP and AJFA. So please, don't say I'm don't know nothing about what I'm talking about, okay ?  Load and Reload are not bad. Sure, it's not thrash, but the Black Album wasn't ether and everyone seems to love it. I don't. Load and Reload are waaaayyyy better than it. Why ? Because the solos are better (it's not MOP, but still...), Lars plays better (again, it's not AJFA) and the lyrics are, most of th time, genius compared to songs like Sad But True or My Friend Of Misery. The production is also a bit better in my opinion 'cause it gives more importance to the guitars.   The best song on Reload is The Memory Remains and other highlights include Fuel, Devil's Dance, Carpe Diem Baby, Where The Wild Things Are, Low Man's Lyric and Fixxxer. In fact, pretty much everything except Better Than You (how the hell did this song win a Grammy ?) and Slither (not bad, but it's a filler).    Here's my review for the others Metallica studio(or garage) albums :  Master Of Puppets = 5 stars  ...And Justice For All = 5 stars  Kill'em All = 4.5 stars  Ride The Lightning = 4.5 stars  Garge Inc. = 4 stars  Load = 3.5 stars  Reload = 3.5 stars  Black Album = 2 stars  St. Anger = 1.5 stars
B000EHSVQE|3.0|Napoleon Dynamite is one weird film.  You will find yourself laughing hysterically at times and completely bored at others.  There is no real plot to the film other than Napoleon's (Jon Heder) efforts to get his friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) elected class president.  Napoleon lives with grandmother and his effeminate brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  After grandma is hurt riding in the dunes, Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to watch after the boys even though Kip is 32.  While Napoleon is an outcast with no friends, Uncle Rico is the saddest character in the film.  He is desperately trying to recapture his glory days and even goes so far to buy a time machine that will take him back to 1982.  What saves this film from being a total bore is the immensely likable cast.  Mr. Heder is great in the title and everyone else makes their characters quirky but fun.
0393307050|3.0|Master and Commander is the first of a series of books written about a British Naval Captain and his doctor friend who serve aboard a man of war during Britain's war with Napoleonic France. The captain, Jack Aubrey, has just received his commission to command the Sophie, a Brigandine Sloop, off the coast of Spain. He is to interrupt as much French and Spanish shipping as possible. Dr. Stephen Maturin, who in addition to being a brilliant physician has a knack for intelligence gathering, is a bit of an eccentric as he likes to collect rare and at times poisonous wildlife. The novel follows their adventures as they undertake larger and increasingly dangerous missions in Her Majesty's Service. <br /> <br />I picked this up because I enjoyed the film version, starring Russell Crowe, and I'm a big fan of historical fiction. I was torn between giving the book three or four stars but I finally decided on three because it took me so long to finish. That's always the ultimate barometer for how much I enjoy a novel. When it is excellent, I devour it in a matter of days. When it is merely good, it takes me weeks. This one took me almost two months.  <br /> <br />For the good points, it was well informed about its period in history and about life aboard a British man of war. The British Navy dominated the seas at the time of the Napoleon and there is fertile ground here to explore most of the major conflicts of the time. O'Brian's accounts of the naval engagements involving the Sophie are gripping. His knowledge of seamanship, practices in the British Navy and how the sailors lived is amazing. <br /> <br />On the downside, I would have enjoyed more character development among the main characters. Aubrey and Maturin come across more like caricatures than men. One of the major plotlines deals with the friction between Captain Aubrey and his First Officer, a Lieutenant Dillon. Dillon has as much seniority and experience as Aubrey but because of politics, he doesn't get his own command. It would have been interesting to see the men deal with their differences more realistically but that never happens. Another criticism is that during the battles you never get the sense of fear or impending doom that you probably should. As the sailors prepare to fire canon balls at other ships and have them hurled back at them, they seem more like children playing a game than men about to risk their lives. Maybe I'm used to modern depictions of war but I would have expected the sailors to be more affected by their comrades who have been maimed or killed in these actions. <br /> <br />Overall it was a worthwhile read and I am likely to make another foray into the world of Aubrey and Maturin but it might be a while.  <br />
1932100385|5.0|When I read this book, I had the feeling that I have discovered something that somehow, inside me, I knew it was right. <br /> <br />After John Robbins's 'Diet for a New America' and 'The Food Revolution', who were written from the heart, this is the book that was written from the true scientist's point of view, and it brings that extra pertinent information you always knew it has to exist somewhere, but it was hard to find.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|I remember a time where I relished in buying mobb deep albums for years. Then, something happened after Murda Muzik. The album quality began to decline. Then came the hiatus (if you want to call it that) Anyway, I heard the mobb do an interview with Big Tigger when I was in KY and the album was finally on the way. I will admit. all the qbc dunn language and all east coastness, that seem to be gone. But, the beats is what got me. This is not the album you want to buy if you are looking for subject matter. I almost wished that I had kept my last 10 bucks at the time. Oops!
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Sufjan Stevens and his ambitous 50 states project return with Illinois and the verdict... its good. not great, but definatly good. many people have said it sounds like one man gone amuck in a studio, and in a way, it is. but listen to the layers, understand the lyrics, and its something much more. sufjan has done his research, hes dug as deep as a boy from michigan can dig into the midwest. and what he has found is (for those who find the music enjoyable) an ALMOST life changing experiance. the music could be crisper, less pretentious, and in many cases, have LESS layers, but its still a strong body of work. standout tracks, \\"Come on! Feel the Illinoise!\\",  \\"Jacksonville\\",  \\"Chicago\\",  \\"They are Night Zombies\\" and \\"The Tallest Man, The Broadest Shoulders\\"
0380002930|5.0|This book became an instant favourite of mine the moment I read it at the age of eleven; and, indeed, I can't count the number of times I've read it since then. I find it very grounding, with its poetic descriptions of nature and it's primal account of survival, all masterfuly depicted from the lapine point of view. This book really soars when it tells of the fables of El-ahraihrah; Adams does a masterful job of creating an animal mythology that underscores the trials of his protagonists, Hazel, Bigwig, and Fiver. I can't help to imagine that Kenneth Oppel must have been inspired by this book when writing the \\"Silverwing\\" series, for it seems to have some similar echoes. In any case, Watership Down is a classic, and I never hesitate to recommend it to the kids I teach. It's beautifully written, contains high adventure, and strengthens the spirit. Somehow it manages to be sentimental too, without being melodramatic--truly, a remarkable feat.
0803729227|4.0|Mum's opinion: The Snail and the Whale is a delight to read with the rhyming text and adventurous journey around the world. To pick two creatures so totally different in every respect is pure genius and works like a dream. Not sure who got the most pleasure from this--me reading it or the little one listening.  <br /> <br />Oliver's opinion: I was so excited to get this book as the title made me laugh. The snail is a cheeky little chap who wants to travel. When I first saw the whale I thought he was going to be frightening as he was enormous. But he's really kind and gives the snail a lift around the world. I felt sad when the whale beached but it all turned out good and the snail got to help the whale out. I can't wait for it to be Daddy's turn to read it tomorrow. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Our young reviewer from England loves The Snail and the Whale. He's never been wrong yet so I suspect children will love this one. It's recommended for children ages 4-8. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0767817478|1.0|The magic behind the original Japanese Gojira series of movies is the corniness of the plot as well as the cheekiness of the special effects. Just as the \\"Batman\\" movie completely lost the \\"comic book\\" feel of the original series, this movie loses the entire sense of the character and allows the \\"plot\\" to deteriorate into nothing more than a \\"shoot 'em up- blow 'em up\\" movie with a lot of gratuitous violence toward an animal whose only crime is the fact that it is behaving like an animal. I literally threw this in the trash 3/4 of the way through the movie.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|After the dissapointment of 2002's Riot Act, I was not sure where this once great band wiuld go next.  I went and picked up their new album and I was \\"BLOWN AWAY\\".  This album is amazing!  When i heArd \\"World Wide Sucude on the radio I thought it was one of the best tracks of the year.  The rest of the album proved that PJ still had it in them.  This album to me sounds like vitaligy.  There is not 1 bad song on this disc.  Any PJ fan whi does not have this does not know what they are missing.  To all the PJ fans GO AND PICK THIS UP NOW!
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|If you don't know anything about Final Fantasy, if you have never heard of Cloud Strife in your entire existence, if someone says \\"Sephiroth\\" and you say \\"Who?\\", you will enjoy this DVD anyway. It is total eye candy for the unversed FF viewer like myself.  I saw it once and had to watch it again, then again, then again.  At this writing, I've lost count of how many times I've seen the film.  It grows on you, and if you are lucky enough to  hook up with someone who is a radical FF fan of old (my nephew, in this case), they can fill you in on enough of the recent past (two years in the case of Advent Children) so that the film makes entire sense and you somehow slip past the screen into the lives of the characters on that screen and share in all that they are experiencing.  The action sequences are breathtaking, and the filmakers have captured in CGI the full range of human emotions in their characters.  Of course, you have to deal with the obstacle of seeing a Japanese movie with English voice-overs, but you will become so engrossed with what is unfolding on the screen, that the voice-overs become a minor distraction at most.  The soundtrack is an interesting mix of majestic, hard driving metal (for the action scenes), and wistful/mellow for scenes where memories for the characters are invoked. If some of the action seems a bit \\"far out\\", remember that this movie is based on a video game.  You know how far out some of the action scenes are in those video games, right?  So don't knock it, just enjoy it.  Soar right along with the characters.   <br /> <br />My advice:  Pop up the corn, ice up the soda, invite friends and neighbors.  Then get ready to be wowed. Definitely worth your time - many times over.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I had watched the orginal release version of the movie several times with many questions as to the gaps between seens and lack of charater development because of these cut scenes. Non the less, Kingdom of Heaven quickly became a favorite of mine. <br /> <br />I highly recommend the extended version solely because it added more depth and emotion to the entire story, blending many lives into the cause and effect of the Crusades.  Scott did a great job making the war scenes graphic and made some of the soliders recognizable from smaller roles in the film so the audience attaches to more than the main charaters and feels the truth that war touches and effects all.  Innocent or guilty. <br /> <br />This is by no means and \\"pick me up, good guys win\\" kind of movie which I found refreshing. It shows the horrors of war and just how pointless it has been in the past. <br /> <br />I think it's sad that this version was not released in theaters because it seemed almost like an entierly different story, more complex yet complete.  <br /> <br />This is a must have for people who enjoy movies that show a harsh reality and unabashed truth.

0307277674|4.0|Okay so Mr. Brown based his story on a lot of unprovable hypothesis, so what, so does nearly every writer in this and every other Genre. Why must so many people always compare Langdon to Harrison Ford, that is just stupidity, compare Langdon to Characters Ford has played but not to Ford. The book is a great read fast paced for the most part and quite interesting plot twists in some places, though I prefered \\"Angels & Demons\\" more.

B00000IZOR|3.0|Like most one year olds, our daughter is obsessed with the phone!  I took me ages to find a simple toy phone for her.  I didn't want the cell phone type because they all make such irritating noises!  So I thought the Chitter Chatter phone would be perfect.  But like other folks have said, the receiver cord is SO short!  The phone dangles down awkwardly in front of her when she hold it.  Additionally, and this is no fault of Fisher Price, Maeve is used to cordless style phones.  She's never seen a rotary phone so she wasn't as excited as I was!  Oh, and P.S., to the lady who's child was strangling themselves with the phone in the crib, DON'T LEAVE YOUR CHILD IN THE CRIB WITH TOYS.  That's so freakin' dangerous!

B00005JOVH|4.0|I got to see this new X-Men movie because my wife and I were too late to see the last showing of its theatre-mate: The Da Vinci Code. At first I was disappointed, but considering the awful reviews for the latter film, perhaps I was lucky after all! <br /> <br />Neither my wife nor myself (we're both post-college career people in our 20s) are at all interested in comics, but we both found this film exciting. It seems that there were two previous films in this franchise, and neither of us saw those, but that didn't prevent us from figuring out who was who, what powers they had, and so on. The only trouble I ran into was determining why Xavier and Magneto had a falling out and became enemies, after being friends. Also, it was clear that there were some romantic triangles involved in the previous two films that reach a [violent] resolution in this third installment, but not seeing how those relationships panned out still doesn't make this film a dud or anything like that. <br /> <br />It was kind of fun during this movie to play \\"spot the star,\\" since there were many actors in it who achieved fame elsewhere (Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, and of all things, Frasier). <br /> <br />There were only a couple of eyebrow-raising moments for me during the film -- and on both occasions they involved a male character calling a female character the \\"B\\" word in an obvious attempt at humor. Even though both male characters (a police security guard and the mutant superhero \\"Juggernaut\\") get their comeuppance, both moments struck me as rather unfunny, and nobody in our particular theatre laughed. When Juggernaut uses the word, he uses it against a little girl (superhero or not, she's a little girl) so it seemed kind of jarring. <br /> <br />Other than those couple of moments, this movie is a great ride and you won't regret it!

B0000035E7|5.0|OK, I am completely amazed at the polarizing viewpoints of reviewers of Nirvana records. I am writing this as a review of Bleach, but I have been reading the reviews of Nevermind as well. To all of you music elitists, I am pretty sure that you are either someone who has never picked up a guitar or someone who has played so much they can't get past the influence of  <br />Rush. Look, I was and still am a huge fan of Iron Maiden, their 1st 2 records are still 2 of my favorites, Steve Harris taught me how to play bass, for crying out loud! But to call Cobain a talentless hack is just ignorant. It's like saying Caravaggio couldn't draw. This is actually my favorite Nirvana album. They are a band that pretty much changed my life. I know exactly where I was when Nevermind came out. I think it rather amusing that most of the slaggers are kids that weren't even alive when this band was around. You know, Nevermind has 1600 plus reviews. If that doesn't = influential then I don't know what does. <br />peace

B000AL730Y|5.0|The first time you hear it, you like it but don't love it.  Then you hear it again.  And again.  And again.  At that point, for me, it became my favorite McCartney album -- period.  Right now, it's the only CD in my car and I play it, and sing along with it, constantly.  There are some beautiful lyrics and haunting melodies.  With the entirety of his work to choose from, I would be quite happy to go to a concert and have Paul sing this entire album, from beginning to end -- and sing nothing else -- and have the time of my life.  Check this out \\"I guess you'd rather see me grow --- into a better man than the one you know\\".  Or this, \\"The definition of friendship, apparently ought to be showing support for the one that you love\\".  Paul wrote every note, plays every instrument, sings every lyric.  And the very thought that he would lose the Grammy to Kelly Clarkson, a manufactured artist, is absurdly appalling.  Talent is no longer rewarded I guess.  But for me, the music is its own reward. And THIS is a great reward.
0156030306|5.0|I found the book Flowers for Algernon to be one of the best books I have ever read in my life.  I deeply touched by the characters and events that happened in this book. I was very interested to see how Charlie Gordon reacted with his newfound unknown world.  It was interesting to see how Charlie changed as he gained knowledge from the experiment, and to see how he treated his superiors as he far surpassed them in intelligence.  One thing I did not like in this book, was the pace at which it began.  I found myself rather bored, and confused during the introduction, but it redeemed itself very fast once the book sped up.  I would recommend this book for any reader who has developed basic reading skills and is also mature enough to handle a book amount a mentally retarded person without finding the things he does funny.  If I could change one part of the book, I would rather it have a happy ending rather then the sad downfall which the author so choose.
0553801503|2.0|Let's get down to brass tacks:    The first three books? Excellent. Each was better than the one before. The first book took me awhile to get into, but by the halfway point I knew I was in for a real treat with this series. But my opinion took a nose-dive after this thing.    Three excellent books notwithstanding, Martin has definite strengths and weaknesses. I would like to touch on these.    Martin's main strength, I think, is his actual plot development. The first three books had complex, exciting, unpredictable plots. In this book. the plot takes a left turn into a brick wall. It never really gets rolling. Not like in the first three books. A Storm of Swords had more plot in two chapters than is contained in this entire book.  Frightening to say what is obvious here, and I hoped I never would have to, but here it is:    Shades of RJ.    Throughout the entire series, Martin's prose -- word-smithing, dialogue, pacing -- all of these are adequate. Good but not great. Some find the constantly changing point-of-view, from chapter to chapter, to be refreshing, riveting, novel, ingenious, etc. I find it somewhat tedious at times, and evidence of fickleness, a writer who cannot settle on a protagonist or three. You can look at the wanton removal of characters as proof of this flightiness. Do we really want to read POV from a secondary character who may not last three quarters of a book; or, that we wish wouldn't last that long? More shades of RJ. (And since I am on the subject of that RJ fellow, I must ask: did Martin *really* refer to a dragon eating its tail?! I know RJ must have stolen that snake thing from somewhere, that many or most of his concepts were shamelessly \\"borrowed\\" -- but still, that's been done.)    Speaking of characters, most are not likeable, and some are not cut out for POV. Hardly a sympathetic character in the bunch.  I guess maybe Martin feels the same, because he kills them off as readily as if they were houseflies. I don't have a problem withthis, really; it adds grit and realism to the story. But it is nonetheless interesting to note this in a writer, this scarcity of larger-than-life heroes. Again, it adds grit, but the problem is, so many POV characters, and so few likeable or truly interesting characters. Do the math: there are many characters we would rather not spend too much time delving into; some cans of worms are just unappealing. And some are just a bit dull.    Now, let's look at the characters we really, really like to read about, the ones where we are sorry when their chapters are over. We have a whoring, patricidal, black-sheep dwarf with a surprising sense of honor and nobility; a young [...], marked for greatness, with a painful sense of honor and nobility; and a soft, fat coward who nevertheless manages, nobly, to control and overcome his cowardly nature enough to get the job done without wetting himself. There are, of course, a few others that are quite interesting to read about. Still, for characters that really grow on you, those are pretty much the ones that do it -- for me at least. But what characters! These are excellent, well-developed personalities set in complicated situations. So where the hell are they in this book???    Perhaps the most compelling character in this installment is a revolting, incestuous, child-maiming knight whose prowess was removed along with his sword-hand. It's hard to look past this guy's grotesqueness and callus baseness, to see any worthwhile fabric underneath -- but behold! there it is. Like it or not, and irredeemable though he should be, there is something here to fascinate the reader. He is, unarguably, an interesting character, tarnished, twisted, and unforgivable though he is.      But this book is off point. I was disappointed and bored.
0553801503|2.0|The first three books in this series were top notch and I pre-ordered Feast for Crows with high anticipation. Martin really disappoints his fans in this one. While he has said that this book was necessary to prevent a huge novel from emerging, the majority of the book I found boring in the extreme and found myself skimming forward to my favorite characters chapters. The Arya chapters are the only ones that I found kept me enraptured like I was throughout the first three novels. I have been diappointed in other long series before. Robert Jordan's encyclopedic series is an excellent example of a really good story that the author murders by trying to extend the story to generate more books (and $) at the cost of the reader (I will never read Jordan again). I really hope that Martin does not follow the same road.
B000F3A7LO|5.0|The late 1970s was a period of reinvigoration and rediscovery for Robert Fripp-- in 1974, after dissolving King Crimson, Fripp withdrew from the music industry only to be drawn back a couple years later working with Peter Gabriel and the David Bowie/Brian Eno partnership. A relocation to New York and musical reawakening due to the punk and new wave scenes burgeoning there led to the recording of \\"Exposure\\", Fripp's first and only \\"proper solo album\\" (his words, not mine). <br /> <br />Drawing on an unusual list of collaborators-- vocalists Daryl Hall (of Hall & oates), Terre Roche (the Roches), Peter Hammill (Van der Graf Generator) and Peter Gabriel with instrumental contributions by Tony Levin on bass, Barry Andrews (XTC, Shriekback) on organ, session man Sid McGinnis on guitar and drum contributions by Jerry Marrotta, Phil Collins (back when he was a drummer) and Narada Michael Walden, Fripp ends up with a pretty unusual stew. The music is like King crimson dragged through a New York filter-- post-punk, new wave, progressive rock, art rock and others all come filtering through. Commercial considerations limited some contributions-- Daryl Hall's label forced Fripp to remove some of his contributions for fear association with Fripp would damage his marketability (Hall's first solo album, \\"Sacred Songs\\", produced by Fripp, was also delayed several years by the label for the same reason) and a cover of \\"I Feel Love\\" featuring Blondie was stopped by their label, again for commercial concerns, but nonetheless \\"Exposure\\" works out to be one of those startlingly diverse and undatable albums. <br /> <br />From the start, this is an odd affair-- the first song (after an odd preface) finds Fripp, Hall (on piano), Levin and Walden sinking in to a punky almost stride groove on \\"You Burn Me Up I'm a Cigarette\\", with Hall's uncharacteristically aggressive vocal soaring over the fierce backing track. But the album doesn't embrace this sound for long, moving between Crimson-esqueinstrumentals (\\"Breathless\\" and \\"Haaden Two\\", both with the sort of monsterous riffing that made Fripp's reptuation), explosive art rock pieces (rambling \\"Disengage\\", featuring a shouted, ranting vocal from Hammill, Roche and Hammill duetting over Fripp's pounding riffing on \\"I May Not Have Had Enough of Me But I've Had Enough of You\\"), an oddly venemous love ballad (swinging \\"Chicago\\", check Hammill's bizarrely tortured vocal) to simply lovely and beautiful balladry (the delicate clean-tone guitar driven \\"Mary\\", ably sung by Roche and what to my mind is the definitive version of Peter Gabriel's \\"Here Comes the Flood\\", with Gabriel's plaintive vocal backed by his piano and Frippertronics). <br /> <br />The problem is with an album this startlingly diverse and quite unlike so many other things Fripp's been involved in, it's highly likely that people who love Fripp's music may find this unlistenable. But one of the things I love about \\"Exposure\\" is that in its diversity, it provides a number of opportunities for finding new things on repeated listens, and it really is a magnificent album. <br /> <br />This reissue is quite a package-- it presents the album as it was originally released (or close to at least), soemthing that hasn't been done ever on CD, it also includes a second disc close to the CD mix, but restoring all of the Daryl Hall vocals that were forcibly removed.  Intriguingly, one is painted a drastically different picture of Hall than you'd get without this, and one wonders what direction his career would have ended up in had this been issued intact-- his vocal on \\"Disengage\\" is a piece of fierce energy that belies description.  Additionally, a handful of bonus tracks, alternates from the sessions, etc. are included (although the Fripp/Blondie track never surfaced). <br /> <br />Sonically, the upgrade is fantastic-- I always thought the '89 remasters of the Crimson catalog sounded great until I heard the 30th anniverary editions, ditto for this release--there's a sonic clarity and level of detail that makes this a worthwhile upgrade, and like the Crimson reissues, there's details here you never heard. <br /> <br />The album also includes extensive liner notes, both reproduction of the originals, lyrics and excerpts from Fripp's diary during the remastering process.  It makes for a worthwhile lead. <br /> <br />This is an album that has gone overlooked-- Fripp's legacy seems to be largely restricted to King Crimson, but \\"Exposure\\" is something no fan of his should overlook.  Highly recommended.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|First, let me point out that the transgender issue does *not* take the forefront in this film.  Despite the title, which most attribute to the main character's journey from a man to a woman, it means much more than that.  The prefix \\"trans\\" implies a crossing or a journey, in this case both literally (across the country, from New York to Los Angeles) and figuratively (as Bree gains the understanding of what is truly important in her life). <br /> <br />Without a doubt, Felicity Huffman is brilliant and truly remarkable in her role as Bree Osbourne, a transgendered individual whose life is anything but simple.  Even in the opening minutes of the film, it becomes crystal clear that her primary focus is on completing her transformation by undergoing her scheduled gender reassignment surgery.  She is deceived when she thinks this will be a simple process, as she soon sets out on a trip to bail a young man out of jail.  There's one catch:  the young man is her son and only knows that he hasn't seen his father (Huffman) in years. <br /> <br />A journey of discovery soon follows, as Bree travels with young Toby cross-country.  As they begin to understand one another, Bree struggles with the notion of telling Toby the truth.  It is only then that she begins to understand that there might be other important things in her life that she never before considered. <br /> <br />Felicity Huffman should be commended for her portrayal of the proper yet outspoken Bree.  Her performance is, at times, heartwrenching yet astute, and in every scene she is right on the mark.  Kevin Zegers also does a strong job of playing the misguided Toby, a teenager with countless problems who seems to secretly long for a loving parent to hold onto. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled, however -- in spite of the many wry, witty moments, TRANSAMERICA runs in a vein much deeper than a conventional comedy:  it is, at the same time, a powerful story of love and the struggle of self-discovery.  Rent or buy it withan open mind, and you're sure not to be disappointed.  Very highly recommended.

The jewel case may have been a better option in this case. <br /> <br />Regardless of packaging, this is an album that has gone overlooked-- Fripp's legacy seems to be largely restricted to King Crimson, but \\"Exposure\\" is something no fan of his should overlook.  Highly recommended.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|Two of my best friends were living their last days when Philadelphia was made. One of them went to the Dr. whose office was used in the opening scenes, and was receiving an experimental drug that was the precursor to today's more successful cocktails. I watched them struggle at a time when Reagan wouldn't even say the word AIDS to the public. Bush wasn't much better. So to have a film come out that tried its best to tackle the most tragic disease in our lifetime, one that touched me personally, well, I was and am willing to forgive a couple of shortcomings. It was a monumental film for anyone struggling with AIDS, and for those who helped support them, giving us all one of the first voices that permeated the psyche of our country, beyond the boundaries of NY and SF. <br /> <br />Now I just learned a good 14 years after the fact, that one of those best friends, Tim Pettifer, was among the guys in the waiting room in \\"One Foot On A Banana Peel and the Other In the Grave\\" which is included here.  In his characteristic modesty, he never mentioned that it might be produced, and it was released after he died. I'm going to buy it of course, and am filled with nervous anticipation (and dread) at the thought of seeing him come back to \\"life\\". I've never stopped grieving this loss. <br /> <br />My point is that the work and effort that went into this film went far beyond Hollywood and acting and such. It spoke a truth that was, at that time, not being talked about intelligently, if at all. As one of Tim's caregivers, I know for a fact that there was so much in Philadelphia that was spot on. The film bears witness to an excrutiating moment in time, when most of our nation was in total denial. Sadly, not much has changed.
0800177177|5.0|Please don't laugh: my high school girlfriends and I ate up this movie like popcorn. I'm not surprised I didn't go off and see this over and over again like the two movies above I mentioned. Man, I am such a Goth chick, albeit \\"stuck in the coffin\\"! <br /> <br />My parents went to see this before I did back when it was in theatres, and they told me they hated it, it was too overblown for their tastes. That's why kids love this stuff, they get what parents can't stand (I was already gifted at picking out music and lip balm flavors Mom hated, so it just seems natural, right?). <br /> <br />Yes, if you can get past the blood, the beheading, the Pythonesque acting, this is just how my girlfriends and I wanted to be romanced, by a long-dead prince in smokey glasses and Victorian threads who just happens to be absinthe-swilling vampire (too bad most guys I meet don't live up to this, LOL). <br /> <br />Yes, if you have never seen this film before, or went to high school between 1991-1994, call up your girlfriends for a night in with The Count! But be careful: the trip down memory lane is winding and treacherous, so it may not be a bad idea to take a lucky talisman from the gypsies who escort you! <br />

B000002UR7|4.0|People, get over yourselves. \\"OK Computer\\", \\"The Bends\\", and \\"Kid A\\" were all horrible and boring as hell albums. Few can deny that besides idiots. Here, they started off as a really good Brit Pop-Rock band with Grunge influences. If the band stayed this way, all their albums would be good and maybe they would ACTUALLY progress instead of making crappy boring electro indie alt whatever \\"music\\". Most of the songs on here are great, but I rated it a star less since I'm a bit tired of their only true rock radio hit \\"Creep\\". (I'm SERIOUS on that one, are you so called true Radiohead fans (even though I'm not lol w/e) getting this?) Still a decent song and better than any other crap they've done though. All in all, this is the only album by them you should EVER hear. <br /> <br />Overall: BUY IT!
B00006IU73|5.0|There aren't any words for an album as great as In Absentia. Every track here is worth listening to. <br /> <br />Blackest Eyes: 10/10 - One of the best album openers I have ever heard. Starts off very heavy and gets very mellow. <br />Trains: 10/10 - My favorite track off the album, and also a fan favorite. <br />Lips of Ashes: 10/10 - Underrated and awesome song. I love the lyrics. <br />The Sound of Muzak: 10/10 - About one of the great things in life, music, going through a downward spiral. Amazing. <br />Gravity Eyelids: 10/10 - A psychedelic song supposedly written by Steven Wilson when he was in the Dead Sea. It is nothing short of incredible. <br />Wedding Nails: 9/10 - An awesome instrumental track, though it gets a little old after the first dozen or so listens. <br />Prodigal: 10/10 - Another underrated gem. Similar to Gravity Eyelids and Lips of Ashes in a way. <br />.3: 8/10 - Not filler in any way, just not as good as the rest of the album. A great bassline. <br />The Creator Has a Mastertape: 10/10 - The funkiest track here with another amazing bassline by Colin Edwin. <br />Heartattack in a Layby: 9/10 - A beautiful song that takes a bit of getting used to. The lyrics are well-thought out. <br />Strip the Soul: 10/10 - Starting off with another mind-blowing bassline from Colin Edwin, it gets very heavy. Probably the heaviest track here. Not overrated by Porcupine Tree fans, it deserves the praise since it is an awesome track. <br />Collapse the Light into the Earth: 10/10 - A perfect album closer. The strings here make this one of the highlights of this incredible journey. <br /> <br />If you do not own this and you like progressive rock, get all your prog CDs, and sell them on eBay. Just buy this. You will NOT regret it.

You don't understand how seriously those beliefs affect your bottom line until you start to examine them, which is what this book helps you do. There are so many incredible wealth minded books on the market, Think and grow rich, The richest man in babylon, Rich Dad, etc., and all them do an excellent job of teaching you what TO think, this is the only one I've found that teaches you what NOT TO think as well... Just as critical, if not more so... It doesn't necessarily matter how strong your offense is, if your defense is asleep... Wake it up! It's an important read... You have a millionaire mind! =)

In one scene a wounded French soldier is killed. [Was this truth or drama?] Then in 1964 we see children in a car singing a tune based on \\"Sambre et Meuse\\", which dates to the Napoleonic Wars. Next we see a training camp where helicopters will be used in ground battles. [Wasn't this an adaption of a civilian model?] One scene shows officer's wives discussing local conditions and the laundromat. [Are the defective washing machines at the camp a symbol of failure?] One scene recalls Custer's last battle. Custer did not know the size of the enemy; he assumed about 2,500 and not three times as many. Later we hear the Intelligence officer admit they did not know the size of the enemy forces. Ominous? <br /> <br />The mechanized cavalry lands in their helicopters, the soldiers start shooting. Some soldiers run after a lone enemy and are ambushed. The battle erupts in fierce fighting. Two helicopters bring in needed ammunition. Back in the states telegrams arrive with bad news for the families. Were they delivered impersonally? The battle continues with rising casualties on both sides. Air support arrives to drop napalm. Some lands too far from the enemy. They expect another attack at dawn. But the tide has turned, the enemy faces defeat and withdraws. The end of the battle shows a load of journalists arriving to take pictures and question the colonel. After the Seventh Cavalry is withdrawn the Vietnamese reclaim their land. The Colonel returns to his family in his land. <br /> <br />In 1964 General Douglas MacArthur advised LBJ against getting into a land war in Asia. Could this film have been created as a warning against a war in the Middle East? Does it have a subtle anti-war message? It seems different from his earlier film based on the Revolutionary War. <br />
B000EMGAGW|2.0|As soon as i heard Mobb Deep had signed to G-unit i knew it would be right up near the top of the list for being their worst album, and i wasen't wrong! <br /> <br />Please remind me again is this a Mobb Deep album or a 50 cent album? 50 Cent is on about 40-50% of the tracks not to mention the rest of G-unit. its more like the \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\" movie soundtrack recycled, same sounding beats, same guests, 50 cent singing like a women on the hooks. Its good to see it flopped sale-wise because it does not deserve to move many units. <br /> <br />I gave it 2 stars because i don't mind \\"the Infamous\\" or \\"Put Them In Their Place\\" but apart from that the album is garbage <br /> <br />If you wanna hear a good Mobb Deep album go cop \\"The Infamous\\" ... avoid this album at all costs!
B00006IUNN|5.0|The film begins in the desert of southwest America. A Navajo warrior leaves his family, traveling with others. This is followed by combat in the Solomons. The Navajo soldiers will be used as \\"code-talkers\\", using a language that can't be understood by the enemy forces. The wounded corporal is able to cleverly pass the hearing test and return to active duty. He will protect the code at all costs, and is promoted to sergeant. We see the training camp, the troops are told of their invasion target. <br /> <br />The combat scenes are extensive. Using code-talkers saves precious minutes in relaying information. There is an example of prejudice against a Navajo. After the end of battle there is a lull in action. A sudden counter-attack by the enemy surprises the troops. [No sentries on duty?] These violent scenes are dramatic. The troops advance to the last enemy area, up on the ridge. The enemy makes another counter-attack; they also have a number of guns that surprise the advancing marines. [Where is the air reconnaissance and support?] It appears the code talker is close to being captured, but air support arrives to halt the counter-attack. The finish comes as a surprise and a reverse of Hollywood traditions. <br /> <br />The film has a large cast that is unusual nowadays. The list of expert advisors attests to its realistic portrayal of close combat. I wonder if there was some hidden purpose behind this? <br />

B0007PLLQ0|4.0|A young Tom Cruise stars in Ridley Scott's \\"Legend\\", a tale of adventure set in an unnamed world full of goblins, dwarves, nymphs and even a couple of unicorns. It's not the most elaborate fantasy in the world, but its put together fairly well. <br /> <br />A princess (Mia Sara) is in love with a young man from the forest, Jack (Tom Cruise). Jack can talk to animals, and knows where the last two unicorns in the world are. Jack takes the princess to visit them, and she calls one to her with her song, reaching out to touch it. Little does she know that a dark lord (Tim Curry) also has his eye on the unicorns, and has sent his minions to capture and kill them, with their arrow poised to kill that very moment. It strikes, and the minions saw off the fallen unicorns horn, sending the world into winter.  If the unicorn's mate can also be destroyed, the world will be plunged into darkness, which is exactly what the dark lord wants, as light is his \\"destroyer\\". The princess gets swept away by the minions, and Jack by a band of dwarves and nymphs, lead by an impish fellow known as Gump. It seems it is up to Jack to put things right. Can he do it, or will the world be plunged into darkness forever? <br /> <br />This film alludes to various mythologies and stories. The touching of the unicorn and its consequences is reminiscent of the Garden of Eden, or even the story of Pandora's box. The dark lord's account of the beginning of time is like a twisted version of the first few verses of Genesis. He even prays to his father, which I'm guessing is the dark accuser, the devil himself. The riddle told by Gump to Jack reminded me of the riddles in Tolkien's Middle Earth and Joe Dever's Lone Wolf, while the giant pies in the dark lord's kitchen reminded me a little of Jack and the Beanstalk. You could look at all this two ways I suppose. The film is using well worn, well loved storytelling archetypes or its lazily depending on fantasy stereotypes. If you've seen and read a fantasy ortwo, there's not much that's new here. Still, it doesn't matter too much, I still got sucked into all that was going on. <br /> <br />The 1980s had the best fantasy films.  They look and feel so special. All the shades of brown, the ultra bright shades of white, the makeup, prosthetics the slightly blurred touch to everything. I particularly liked the ugly green witch in this film. There's a soundtrack by Tangerine Dream, but I really wouldn't have noticed unless I'd known it was them. <br /> <br />Recommended for lovers of fantasy. It's not the finest of its kind, fairly generic for a fantasy, but definitely worth a look.
B0000029GA|5.0|To sum it up in 1 sentance... this is the best album of all time! simple as...
0689865384|5.0|Uglies is a really good book about a dystopian city, and a teenage girl living in it. she has to deal with the pressures of looking good and having friends. i recommend this trilogy to anyone who wants a book or books with supsense. i'm in the middle of pretties and loving it, and specials just came in the mail yesterday.
B00005R1N3|5.0|i must point out the fact that i am a fan of gore and it has been a long time since i have seen a horror film with very little if any gore. this movie was well done, its scare the heck out of ya in a very subtle way. and their is maybe and ounce or two of blood through out the whole film. a classic amongst classics
B00005LANG|5.0|The story behind Exodus is worthy of a book - in fact there is a book on the making of Exodus. This and the follow-up 'Kaya' were recorded and assembled in London in the 18 months following the attempted assassination of Marley in December 1976. The first side of the album (old-school vinyl fans know what I mean) is pure revolutionary reggae rock: Natural Mystic, So Much Things to Say, Heathen, Guiltiness, and Exodus. Drop-dead master reggae powered by the brother team of Aston 'Family Man' Barrett on bass and Carlton Barrett on drums. <br /> <br />In the book 'Exodus' author Vivien Goldman takes you inside the studio in some very intimate recollections. Bob, for instance, worked the band from mid-afternoon til the wee hours of the morning. Generally speaking the band would record basic tracks for a song, and keep working on it until it was deemed 'finished,' when they'd then move on to the next track. <br /> <br />On several occasions he came in alone to record vocals for songs by himself, and at one point spent several hours working to get the right 'take' for a song. Of course this was before the days of digital mixing where you could drop in a word or phrase at a time, so Bob was singing each time all the way through. He would work until his voice warmed up and finally nail a take. <br /> <br />On to side two: Jammin', Waiting in Vain, Turn Your Lights Down Low, Three Little Birds, One Love/People Get Ready. Some of the sweetest and most intimate love songs I've ever heard, as well as the spirited Jammin' - one of the most uplifting songs ever to grace my earbuds. <br /> <br />Exodus is one of those rarities - a coming together of great songwriting, stellar performances, ground-breaking recording methods (read the book!), and timeliness. As a historical document of the best that Bob Marley and the Wailers had to offer, as well as a kick-ass soulful album to crank up, Exodus has it all.
1559408855|2.0|i watched this film after watching many so- called disturbing movies.I am well educated, but had little knowledge of fascist Italy at the time of viewing.I was also aware of the controversy surrounding the film and its director at the time of viewing. Bearing all this in mind,I would suggest that any of these reviewers cannot seriously be suggesting that this is a \\"work of art, beautifully shot, very dangerous film, symbolic in meaning\\" etc.it just isn't. the film is littered with homosexuality, which in light of the fact that pasolini himself was gay is not surprising. the context in which it is presented I think is merely coincidental. i just think he crammed it in wherever possible. the scat is as revolting as you would imagine- in the days of no internet, i should imagine every scat freak out there would have gone to extreme lengths to see this. <br />This comes a cross as an in depth view of what fascists would get up to if allowed, and in that scope, has nothing new to offer- of course they will do depraved acts if they can get away with it. <br />It has little storyline to offer, the 2 stars are for the acting- the fascists are quiite convincing. <br />Overall, its poor, and anyone who thinks that im missing the point- im not. I did my fascist homework after viewing in order to see if i could substantiate any of the other reviewers positives, and guess what- i couldn't. <br /> <br />the violence is tame compared to some more modern films, although still relatively disturbing.
B000E33VWW|3.0|Capote starring oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman is an ok film that surrounds a true life story. Truman Capote (Hoffman) is a writer, he is resepected in his field, he wrote the book Breakfast at Tiffany's but for his new book, he decides to write about two men who killed a family in Kansas. His book, In Cold Blood made Capote a legend but it also ended his career as a gifted writer, he felt such tremendous guilt about the way he manipulated one of the killers, Perry Smith. Capote becomes depressed, paranoid and eventually drinks himself to death but none of this is shown in the film. I think the film was good but a bit boring at times. But Hoffman's performance is truly captivating, his performance alone is a reason to watch Capote. Take it or leave it.
B00005JP4U|1.0|Al Gore is at it again with his liberal environmentalist whacko issues of the so-called global warming. We cannot say it's the truth, and it should only be based on theory. Global warming is only used by liberals as a scare tactic. Al Gore spent too much time growing up as a city slicker in Washington when his segregationalist daddy, Al Sr, was in the Senate. Gore only relies on data released by these so-called environmentalists. <br /> <br />If you really want to know better about the environment, it is not CO2 emissions that causes global warming. While CO2 is the heaviest gas in our atmosphere, all human and animal life exhale CO2 which is a beneficial gas that vegetation thrives on such as trees and plants that take in the CO2 and convert it back to oxygen. Also, the \\"warming\\" we are experiencing is due to the fact that climate changes occur in cycles. There have been record highs over one hundred years ago as well as record lows in between. The last few winters we've experienced were at record lows, particularly in upstate New York where temperatures dipped down to a fridgid -35ºF. Now what does that explain? In any part of the world climate does not remain stable where one would experience the same temperatures over and over again at a certain time of year since there are changes occurring all the time, it alternates. <br /> <br />Volcanic eruptions would be a very big problem since a single volcano can release nearly ten times more toxic gases than all manmade emissions throughout the world combined. Third world nations account for environmental problems where there are virtually no strict codes on hazardous waste disposal. Hence, disease is rampant in these nations that have very few or no sanitation facilities by dumping solid waste directly into drinking water or into the ocean where deep water coral reefs thrive. Yes, there are deep water reefs in many parts of the world that encapsulate CO2 and other gases. Pollutants dumped into the sea are killing these reefs, thus releasing these gases into the atmosphere. <br /> <br />True environmentalists are usually those employed by the logging industry that have done intense studies, maintaining nurseries, and replacing each hewned tree with two to four saplings. Younger trees, particularly saplings, thrive better on CO2 and have the tendency to release more oxygen than older specimens. <br /> <br />We can only say that Al Gore has a lot of learning to do. He's just jumping to conclusions and listening to whatever data is available to him. This film would only be based on his opinions and not on fact.
B00006YXOX|5.0|The DG set is crowned with the finest 9th ever put to disc...the recording is also very good through all the symphonies in spite of different recording venues.   <br /> <br />Sadly, Jochum has been neglected by history... <br /> <br />We have come to a certain point where the entire Bruckner style is going to be lost with a blasty unorganic orchestral style so epitomized by the Tintner reading on Naxos.. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />As to interpretations the entire cycle is played very well..the early symphonies are all played and strongly thought out... without ever sounding hard or dull...the Jochum 3rd clearly outshines Tintner in matters of exression....ensemble in the brass is very good with super work from the timpanist in both ensembles...woodwinds are very fine and at times wonderfully caught by the DG engineers... <br /> <br />I am a very big proponent of the Jochum/Walter camp in these works...some rubato in certain moments is welcome... <br /> <br />George Tintner is so deadpan as to invoke sleep...but of course he did not have the Vienna or Berlin Philharmonic for his recordings... <br /> <br /> <br />So there you have a great conductor doing Bruckner superbly... get this over the Naxos set!!! <br />
B000001EUP|5.0|i was a junior in high school when this was originally was released on vinyl. i had already been weened on Animal Magnetism and Lovedrive by then, but was pleasibly surprised by this bad boy. what a breath of fresh air! if you were a hard core rocker, then you had Metallica and Motorhead to cut your teeth to, but for those of us who still liked the late '70's early '80's hard rock, ala Y&T, Dio, Ozzy, Judas Priest, AC/DC and others, then this was a diamond in the rough. i was blown away when i first heard this. it didn't seem like the same Scorpions i was used to. it seemed heavier, more alive, than those previous releases. this was a release you could sink your teeth into. a head banger. something the Scorps really hadn't fully accomplished until then. not only did they tear it up, but they slowed it down as well. \\"china white\\" is an all time classic, with the likes of the raucas \\"arizona\\" and thrashers \\"dynamite\\", \\"now\\" and of course the famed \\"blackout\\" and \\"no one like you\\". this is a cd any rocker must have in his/her collection. whether you're a thrash fan, a death metal head, or just a plain ol' rocker, you'll do well to have this in your collection. peace.
0670034711|5.0|I loved this book.  I feel like the author wrote it on behalf of many single women who are in search of their purpose in life.  Reading this book was a liberating, educational, and captivating experience.  It also made me realize the power of meditation, which I am starting to practice.
B000002JSN|5.0|if you have never owned a Led Zeppelin release, which would be a shame, then get this one, and you'll know why they are the gold standard of rocks' elite. don't get me wrong, i dig the Stones as much as anyone, but the best rock and roll band of all time, which is what they are called these days, is far from the truth. this milestone of rock music outshines anything any band from the '70's ever put forth; by a longshot. every genre of rock and roll is realized in this cd (or 2 lp originally) set. this is one of those releases that you can play every day, and never tire of. seriously. i kid you not, it is that good. as many of you may have read in my other reviews, i don't spend copious amounts of banter on the \\"why's\\" a cd(s) are great, but prefer to let the reader do the judging on their own. please listen, and hear the magic for yourself. it truly is every bit of the 5 stars it has been given. can i get a 6th star?...... just wonderin'. peace.
B00005JOVH|2.0|The plot didn't fit in my mode of thinking....if genetically someone is a mutant, how does that explain the physical impossiblily of flying around or turning your body into ice or walking through walls?  It doesn't, so why base being a mutant on genetics?  It's more accurate to say they actually have magical powers.  Anyway, the film was mostly devoid of any real emotion and the actors seemed to just be there because they had to be.  Jean is rarely seen struggling with her Phoenix counterpart.  I remember the animated series having a more exciting Phoenix.  Some of the mutants were just thrown together it seems and their powers were so lame(porcupine).  Magneto's helmut looked completely silly and cumbersome.  I wish there were more battles featuring the powers of the mutants.
1591841216|4.0|Arden's book is a creative kick in the pants! If you are considering shutting up, shutting down, and fitting in to a corporate soul killing career - you need to read this book!  <br /> <br />I read it on a recent 1-hour flight from Portland to San Jose. The real life examples point out how and why you are where you are at this very moment - and encourages examination. <br /> <br />Another book along these lines I would recommend & purchased at the San Jose airport on a recent biz trip was - The Sales Adventure Guide. <br /> <br />The Sales Adventure Guide is full of real world business wisdom that you won't find in text books - and it's got cool travel stories!  <br /> <br />Shake up your career and your life & take some chances! You'll earn more $ (I have!) and more importantly - be glad to be alive. <br />
0446677450|5.0|The main point of this book is to simply point out the fundamentals for building wealth. Patience, discipline and mindfullness. The book, for example, encourages us to think about our spending habits by asking: Is this action ultimately putting money in my pocket (an asset) or taking it out (a liability). Unconscious spending and negative beliefs about money cause most to live from paycheck-to-paycheck. It's a useful and simple way of deciding things, rather than favoring the emotional satisfaction spending route, which is where most people fall down financially.  The book addresses this basic problem which must be overcome, to get anywhere near started toward financial independence.  <br /> <br />The author uses the story of his own experiences of mentoring by his real father and that of his friends dad, a local businessman. It is filled with interesting stories, anecdotes and good advice. This was the cd (audiobook) version. <br /> <br />Those lucky readers who can control themselves and have the patience to build a asset reserve, should look elsewhere for financial investment advice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0071410945|5.0|Young's idea producing technique is easy to learn and most importantly - effective. Creative ideas are key to winning new biz and retaining current accounts. <br /> <br />As a Senior Account Exec I live by creatively meeting my customer's needs and the technique in Young's book has added real value. <br /> <br />Another book I enjoyed is - The Sales Adventure Guide.  <br /> <br />I picked up a copy at the San Jose, CA Airport and read it on my 1-hour flight. The Sales Adventure Guide is full or real world business experience that will guide the reader/professional through all types of business situations - and there's no rah-rah to it. <br /> <br />Read these two and thrive! <br /> <br />
B0000024JN|5.0|Anyway this cd deserves to be remastered and re-released for it's 20th anniversary.  I think def jam can afford that.
B000000OXH|2.0|I've seen \\"Arena Rock\\" used quite a bit to describe Asia.  Although I don't generally agree with the term, I can certainly see where it comes from.  Asia didn't move too far away from its debut release when these tunes were composed.  If you liked their first album, you will likely enjoy this one as well. <br /> <br />For a bit more in-depth coverage, I'll say that I don't like Alpha nearly as much as the debut.  Perhaps it's because I was hoping for a bit of growth and an effort to reach beyond what they accomplished with \\"Asia\\". <br /> <br />There are a few somewhat remarkable tunes on this album, though.  I would recommend \\"Don't Cry\\" (which everybody has probably heard) and \\"Eye To Eye\\".  The best tune on this album, though, has got to be \\"The Heat Goes On\\".  It has that same drive and fantastic guitar work from Steve Howe that wooed me with \\"Time Again\\" from the first album. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, a few good songs can't lift this album anywhere above a two-star release.  The rest of the songs range from the mediocre (e.g. \\"The Heat Goes On\\", \\"True Colors\\" and \\"Open Your Eyes\\") to the outright painful, such as \\"My Own Time\\", \\"The Last To Know\\" and \\"Midnight Sun\\". <br /> <br />Generally, Steve Howe's presence is much less obvious on this release and is typically replaced with keyboard work from Geoff Downes.  The good thing is that Downes is an engaging artist, albeit not nearly as much as Howe. <br /> <br />This album is probably worth getting if you are a big Asia fan.  Otherwise, beyond their first album, there is plenty of generic '80s rock to go around.  Look elsewhere.
076790592X|4.0|I think Tuesdays with Morrie was a really touching book. It's also very expiring b because there were a lot of life lessons being taught in it. I really liked how an old professor who is dying can form such a strong relationship with a young adult, and then teach him things in life I also liked how Morrie made me look at life from a different perspective. One thing I didn't like is I thought they kind of dragged the lessons being taught out. I would recommend this book to teens and adults. I think this book could be for any gender because it talks about life and what you shouldn't take for granted, and guys might think its corny, but after they read, it I think they would really like it. I think anyone could read this book because it teaches you that you should never take life for granted. <br />
0156027321|5.0|This book, Life of Pi, is one of those books that slowly draws you into its pages, getting better by the moment, more intriguing by the paragraph, more complex by the page, finally leaving you sad to have it end. Word by word you fall deeper into the narrative, becoming more engrossed with each passing chapter as if each word is a brick, the culmination of which is your building a wall encompassing you and the book. Turn by turn the strange story twists you with it, leading you further into the abyss of this peculiar tale at sea. The story is all of this and more, as Yann Martel serves up a brilliant work of art in this Booker Award winning book. Life of Pi is one of the better works in recent memory. <br /> <br />This is a book which has floated in and out of my field of reading vision over the past several years, appearing occasionally as one of those \\"must reads\\" in the literature community. Despite the passing of time since its initial printing, barely a week goes by when I don't catch a glimpse of someone reading it on the subway. For years it has sat in my enormous unread pile of books sitting in the basement. For no particular reason, it recently jumped out at me as the next book I should read. It may have been a recent sighting on the train, or it may have been the cover. Regardless the reason, it was a great time to read this great book. <br /> <br />When I started, I did so with a healthy dose of caution, since almost every \\"must read\\" falls far short of anything I would actively choose to tell someone else they must read. As often than not, they fall into the inglorious category of \\"must not read\\". The DaVinci Code comes to mind as fitting squarely in that category. Still, this remained one of those lesser known bright spots which wasn't in the same over-hyped air as DaVinci. I wasn't sure if it would be a diamond in the rough or just simply rough. It's always hard to tell. Thus, I walked gingerly into these pages. <br /> <br />From the onset I was interested, though I admit the first 100 pages won't floor you. Don't get me wrong, these are pages which contain good, solid writing. You can feel a hint of Salman Rushdie in the words he writes, an influence or similarity present. But let's be clear, Yann Martel is not Salman Rushdie. Any resonant comparison only leaves Martel looking inferior to the brilliant Rushdie - not that there's anything wrong with that, as most writers look inferior to Rushdie. <br /> <br />Having said that, I feel Martel did a good job with those first 100 pages, even if things were a little sloppy from time to time. To be clear, I never considered dropping the book at any stage. In fact, at that point I thought the book very good, if nothing remarkable. It wasn't until the next 200+ pages churned along when I fell even deeper into the narrative, concluding this was much better than I had initially given it credit for. <br /> <br />If need be, the details of the story can be gleaned from the back of the book or any one of the numerous reviews here. Personally, I would recommend this book blindly, which is something I almost never do. If you're a fan of Rushdie, you'll almost surely enjoy this book. Likewise, if you're a fan of what (for lack of a better expression) I would call \\"accepted high-quality modern literature\\" (YMMV), this will surely hit the spot. Again, Martel is not Rushdie, at least not this early in the game. But the styles are similar. As well, the obvious Indian & Islamic influences are a start. But the modern culture references seal the deal for me. While I see these traits as very Rushdie, Martel uses them successfully, to his benefit. <br /> <br />If you're not versed in earlier Martel or Rushdie works, perhaps it is best to say that this is a good book for someone who likes slow, involved, but very well thought out narratives. Martel delivers this with Life of Pi. As the story rolls on, you find yourself more involved in the situations and philosophical quandaries Pi findshimself tackling. Even if you don't agree with any of them, they're done so well they warrant attention. <br /> <br />One caveat to all this is the discussion guide in the back of the book. Completely unnecessary addition, IMO. Regardless, the book is outstanding, and I certainly recommend it. Well done - I very much look forward to future Martel works.
0451191153|1.0|This book, along with 'Atlas Shrugged', are two of the most vile, uninteresting books you'll ever read.  There wasn't one likeable character in either book!  And that is saying a lot, considering both novels are 2 huge bricks of lumber.  Seriously, was this woman kidding when she wrote these?  Absolute garbage.  There is no warmth or humour or real emotion throughout either of these books.  And so people say it is a philosophy.  Her philosophy of \\"selfishness as a virtue\\" is not grounded in reality.  Perhaps it is for the disillusioned Republicans or Captialists.  You get an image of some smug capitalistic egoist saying to themselves after reading these, \\"see, I can do anything I want because it is human nature to do so..and the world is better off because of it\\".  Reaganites, Bush2, Thatcherites, that type of thinking (note- the story of Enron comes to mind).  We now know that Karl Marx's philosophy was very flawed.  Yet we fail to realize that Adam Smith's philosophy was also flawed.  There is no 'Invisible Hand'.   We do not live in a vacuum.  Yet Ayn Rand thinks we do.   <br /> <br />Another thing... perhaps most important and above everything else when you are looking for a book, whether you are reading the book, or have completed a book you might wonder is this authour likeable or not.  And for that one simple thing, this book is dead last on my list of books I've read.  This is the coldest, elitist, most self-centred, boring, and unrealistic authour I've ever read.  Bar none.   <br /> <br />sidenote - I guarantee she has never been to Cheyenne, Wyoming. <br />sidenote2- I would have given it a zero star rating but the computer wouldn't accept it.  Therefore I had to give it a 1.  Sorry <br /> <br />**If you are looking for a more grounded book; one with emotion and living, breathing characters, read 'The Grapes of Wrath' or 'The Great Gatsby'.  Two American classics about the REAL America.
B000FILW86|5.0|They made the Budokan famous 30 years ago, and now it's time for the pride of Rockford, Illinois to give kudos to the town that bore them. <br /> <br />After making albums with heavy synthesizers (The Doctor); more pop-inflected (Lap of Luxury); and outright heavy rock (Woke Up With a Monster); Cheap Trick has put out an album that covers every aspect of their career with strong melodies throughout, extremely catchy choruses, highlighting a band at its artistic peak. <br /> <br />Rick Nielsen is, without question, one of the most influential guitarists of the rock era.  With an arsenal of hundreds of guitars, he never fails to come up with numerous sounds and riffs that still manage to maintain the Cheap Trick sound.  On Rockford, his signature sounds are all over the place. <br /> <br />Tom Petersson is the inventor of the 12 string bass, an instrument that creates an almost orchestral sound on stage.  Very melodic and original, he offers yet another masterclass in his instrument of choice on this album. <br /> <br />Bun E Carlos has never been anout being flashy or cashing in on the latest drum machines and technology.  He keeps the beat with his own inimitable style.  His drum intros to many Trick classics are known the world over simply from the first few beats and he, once again, is the driving factor of this album. <br /> <br />Now Robin Zander....  What can you say about the Man with a Thousand Voices that hasn't been said before?  Well, nothing.  So I will simply re-hash what has been said by so many before.  His distinct voice is unmistakable on anything from ballads to heavy rockers to the Beatle-esque \\"O Claire.\\"  Robin Zander has one of the dozen voices that are instantly recognizable on American radio. <br /> <br />Together, Cheap Trick are as influencial a band as there has been in the last 30 years.  Their staunchest fans include many of today's biggest young musicians and their shows are filled with many in their teens and 20s.  How many other bandswho have been around for 30 years can say the same thing. <br /> <br />Rockford is as relevant a release in 2006 as Dream Police was in 1979.  This is Cheap Trick at the top of their game, making music on their own terms, adding to their legacy rather than diminishing it.   <br /> <br />The songs contained are classic Cheap Trick -- powerful vocals, distinct guitars, melodic bass and unmistakable drums.  Their sense of melody is as strong today as it ever was. <br /> <br />Cheap Trick are truly the progenitors of power pop and Rockford will go down as one of the best (and most important) releases of 2006.
B000002LEE|5.0|The year was 1988, and the door for alternative rock was about to be blown wide open by an extremely talented punk-goth-progressive-any other genre you want to call them-band called Jane's Addiction. The alternative rock band consisted of Eric Avery on bass, the John Bonham influenced Stephen Perkins (who happens to be the best drummer since the aforementioned influence), virtuoso guitarist Dave Navarro and the most intriguing prescence in the band: Perry Farrell, the lead singer who screeched his angry, frustrated passions out through a voice like no other. Together this unique, original band created one of the greatest alternative rock albums of all time: their arguably finest recording, Nothing's Shocking. Read on for a song-by-song reading. <br /> <br />Up the Beach- 4/5: Good opener, but more of an interlude and a mood-setter. This slightly experimental and wispy intro serves as a good pathway into the heart of this amazing album. <br /> <br />Ocean Size- 5/5: The dreamy acoustic opening guitar soothes you into an expectant mood for another Up the Beach style track. However, the first of Perry Farrell screams immediately jolt the listener: \\"THREE, FOUR!\\" With its left field tempo changes, screeching vocals and piercing guitar work, this is easily one of the best Jane's Addiction recordings, and is the true opener for Nothing's Shocking. <br /> <br />Had a Dad- 5/5: The amazing Ocean Size is followed up by another great track, Had a Dad. The extremely personal lyrics cut through the airwaves like a knife, elevated to the highest possible level with Perry's hauntingly angry screams. Dave Navarro's and Eric Avery's playing lifts this track to a whole other level, and the powerhouse drumming from Stephen Perkins is the only thing keeping it firmly anchored with a great beat and rhythm as well as lead playing that launches out of this stratosphere. <br /> <br />Ted, Just Admit It...- 5/5: The slight experimentation of Up the Beach is completely ripped apart by the truly weird experience of listening to Ted, Just Admit It. The lyrics deal with the media's keeping the world in a state of fear, and their dramatic tension is heightened by the tribal drumming, reggae bass and snippets of interview dialogue about death and destruction. This song is guaranteed to haunt your dreams. <br /> <br />Standing in the Shower...Thinking- 5/5: One of my personal favorites, it's a truly fun song to follow the creepy Ted, Just Admit It... Slightly funky guitar and bass and an fun, upbeat rhythm and feel. Is it possible to not like this song? <br /> <br />Summertime Rolls- 3.5/5- The worst song on the album, it's a rather boring acoustic song that doesn't hold up in comparison to the other slow/mid-tempo track: Jane Says. <br /> <br />Mountain Song- 5/5: The bass starts out with a deep intense groove before letting loose with a scream from Perry Farrell and some intense, slightly metal guitar and heavy-hitting drums. Amazing song, and a great metaphor for coming down off of a heroin high. <br /> <br />Idiots Rule- 5/5: Yes! This song is amazing! Straight-out dirty funk, with horns and everything! This could have come off of a P-Funk album. Truly exhilarating. <br /> <br />Jane Says- 5/5: Probably the most famous Jane's Addiction song, next to Been Caught Stealing. Jane Says is the breakthrough single off the album, and you can see why. It contains some of the best lyrics Farrell ever wrote, an exquisitely beautiful acoustic guitar part, and steel drums that'll bring a chill down your spine. One of the best. <br /> <br />Thank You Boys- 4/5: Good swing song that shows off the band's crazy talent to cover all kinds of musical ground. However, despite being such a showcase for their talent, it really doesn't add much to the emotional depth of the album. <br /> <br />Pigs in Zen- 5/5: This song must be heard to be believed. Alternative music at its best. If this doesn't blow you away, nothing will.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I picked up all 14 episodes of Firefly after having seen Serenity in the cinema. Like the film, the tv series Firefly is a truly great piece of Sci Fi. Funny, wry, touching, poignant, frightening and scary are all adjectives that apply to Firefly.<br />It is also an example of the genre making serious social comment, for example the struggles of the individuals who crew the Firefly class freighter - Serenity against the politically correct and interfering Alliance Government, an entity that appears to be colluding with, or even in hock to Mega Corporations.<br />Now I wonder just where the parody could be there....<br />Sadly this boldness probably contributed to the show's early demise though.<br /><br />Set 500 years in the future, amidst strong undertones of the Old West, Mankind has colonised planets and moons beyond the Earth. A recent war between the Separatists and the Alliance Government has ended with total victory for the latter.<br />Despite being peaceful and benign on the outside, the Alliance is completely ruthless in going about its aims, and tends to step on anyone who gets in its way.<br />Eking out an existence among the outer rim planets, is Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew of largely former Separatists. Nathan Fillion makes for a wry and sarcastic Mal Reynolds, even if the character does nod towards Han Solo at times. Among his crew are Simon, a young doctor and his sister River who is a volatile psychic. Both are being hunted by The Alliance. On board the Firefly class freighter - Serenity, this crew smuggle various cargo and take passengers on a 'no questions asked' basis.<br />Like the film, the tv series casts the characters as real people and this makes them so identifiable and likeable. When they have their rough moments, the viewers tends to find themselves caring about them and their fate.<br />Apart from The Alliance, the crew of the Serenity have to contend with hordes of Reavers. These are horribly mutated space cannibals who raid and pillage, with the intention of capturing people, so as to eat them alive......<br /><br />The main reason for cancelling the show so early into its initial run would be appear to be an attack of gutlessness at Fox, where a company which is normally very pro Government simply did not want a show that advanced the individual, and cast the government into the role of aggressor/villain.<br />The series did not pull in significant viewing figures but other shows have run with less viewers for an entire season, and have then been allowed to build.... So why not this particular series?<br />A suggestion for the poor figures is a boycott by enraged Buffy and Angel fans who were trying to make a point to Joss Whedon, for cancelling both of their favourite series at this time.<br />Another suggestion for the poor figures though is just how much promotional effort did Fox actually put into the show?<br />I still believe though that the decision to cancel by Fox was probably driven by internal politicking, combined with the already mentioned unhappiness with a tv series that portrayed government in the role of the villain. It is a shame because if Serenity had been allowed to build, then it could have gone on to be as big as either Buffy or Angel.<br />This is a puzzle though because Fox has continually supported the Simpsons which has never been afraid of political satire.....<br /><br />Universal now own the rights to the big screen versions and apparently two more are planned after Serenity. I for one certainly look forward to seeing them. Maybe Fox would consider selling on the tv rights to someone else who would be prepared to make a go of it.<br />Anyway  do see Firefly and Serenity for yourself, if you have yet to do so, and be entranced by the unique charm, character, and riveting plots that the tv series and film have to offer. I believe that you will seldom find a more rewarding viewing experience.turing people, so as to eat them alive......

B00091SMJQ|4.0|I enjoyed this album quite a bit but I still like Maiden a lot better. It does sound different than Maiden but Dickinson is so talented he pulls it off. Pay no attention to the moron below me. Anyone who says Blaze Bayley is better than Bruce Dickinson needs therapy. Just wow.
B00005JOTV|4.0|I didn't know what I was going to expect from this movie. Not the biggest fan of Lindsay Lohan, but also am not much of a Lindsay-hater. So... <br /> <br />As someone has previously stated, this ain't not Freaky Friday or maybe even Mean Girls though is DEFINITELY superior to Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. But you know what, I left this movie feeling positive and decided that the movie was alright. <br /> <br />We all know the story so I'll skip that. Laughs are there sometimes. Not really a hilarious movie, but there are a couple of laughs here and there. What I did like in this movie was the heart in it. The Lindsay Lohan character starts off to be a little vain and conceited about her luck, but the Chris Pine character is just so likable. He has constantly been going through a lot of bad luck, but doesn't fret about it too much. When he does gain good luck, he just embraces it but uses it to try and make Lindsay's bad luck much better. Later on, we discover that Lindsay's character does have a bit of a heart too. <br /> <br />For a little cutesy movie, its likable. Not quite a big comedy, but likable. <br /> <br />***1/2 out of *****
B0000683WG|5.0|I wont go in to the virtues of this T.Rex record, there are plenty of other reviews here for that. Suffice to say it is a great record. Instead I will discuss the remastering, and the tracks on the bonus disc, \\" Rabbit Fighter, The Alternate Slider\\". <br /> <br />First the sound quality of the remaster by Edsel. I must agree with one of the previous reviewers in that this remaster is certainly LOUD.However for this recording i dont think this is a bad thing entirely,this is a cd which sounds good at higher volumes. I have good equipment, and although the volume is high, distortion is at a minimum.Just remember to lower the volume before you start playing this disc as it is very loud. Separation is good, and the percussion in particular sounds much more open than on other Slider releases I have heard. Well worth a repurchase for the remaster alone if you own an older version of this on cd. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give the Edsel remaster a 7. <br /> <br />The bonus disc is quite good, much better than the bulk of the bottom of the barrel stuff that is popping up left and right from T Rex these days. The first four songs sound pretty much like the original issue Slider versions, minus overdubs.There are then some above average ( for this type of thing) acoustic versions of some songs, the best of which by far is \\" Main Man\\" with mostly different lyrics, including a nod to Elton John. The best two tracks IMO are \\" Buick Mackane\\" which is a totally different song than the one on the official issue. This song is somewhat difficult to obtain elsewhere, and is excellent. Finally, closing the second disc is a very rocking version of \\" Sunken Rags\\", another gem. <br /> <br />This reissue is well worth purchasing for both newcomers to the Bolan sound, and Bolan fanatics alike.
0060090367|5.0|Marian Keyes has done it again. Watermelon is such a great book. This book follows Claire and her newborn daughter on their journey to survive after Clarie's husband James leaves them. Unsure what to do, Claire returns to her parents' house in Dublin where her two younger sisters still live. The plot that follows is touching, funny, and highly unexpected.
B000FILW86|5.0|I was on Vh1.com recently and saw that Cheap Trick was previewing its latest CD. Let's be honest; it's been a long time since Cheap Trick released a CD that was worthy of their talent and reputation. By that I mean an album filled with great songs and perhaps one or two that don't quite measure up. So I was prepared to be disappointed. I'm happy to report that this album is every bit as good as the classic Cheap Trick, circa '77 - '80.  <br /> <br />I was 12 when Cheap Trick blew up with their \\"Live from Budokan\\" LP and I don't think it left my turntable for the entire summer. Drawing from their first three studio releases, it was, obviously, a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Sadly, like the majority of music buyers, they lost me after too many mediocre albums.....though I always rooted for them to comeback. Their eponymous '97 CD was great (highly recommened), but \\"Rockford\\" is better - significantly better. In fact, I'll go so far as to say it's their best studio effort since \\"Heaven Tonight\\". Similar to Pearl Jam's return to form on its latest CD, this is a CD that anyone who's ever rocked it to Cheap Trick will find extremely gratifying.  <br /> <br />For me, the standout tracks are: <br /> <br />Come on, Come on, Come on <br />Every Night and Every Day <br />If It Takes a Lifetime <br />Dream The Night Away <br />Decaf <br /> <br />All the songs are hook-filled, though whoever made the decision to open the CD with the weakest song ( \\"Welcome To The World\\" ) needs to have their head examined.  <br /> <br />
B00000J2SP|5.0|This is my favorite Rainbow album of the Joe Lynn Turner era. It is more pop then the Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio, but is that a bad thing? NO! It ain't a bad thing if the songs are good. And it is still rock music, it ain't just pop. Joe Lynn Turner has a great voice and Ritchie Blackmore is the best guitarist ever. The other bandmembers are great too. SO buy this if you like some good rock music and ignore the one-star review beneath me.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|This has been remade too many times.  Why can't they leave a good movie alone?  3 hours is way too long.  The original was only an hour and a half or so, which is long enough to watch an overgrown gorilla go haywire.  And what was with Naomi Watts' goofy dance?  Was that necessary?  I thought she was supposed to be afraid of the beast.  Instead, she's juggling and making him laugh.  Unbelievably sexist and stupid.  And the trampling of the dinosaurs?!  HELLO!!!! Way too long!!!!!  The acting and the script was just plain awful.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you've never seen Firefly--the film upon which Serenity is based--you should. It's a terrific series and was poorly handled by the network leading to an unfair demise. However, if you don't want to have to watch an entire television series in order to watch a film, that's alright; Serenity stands on its own. <br /> <br />Serenity, the name of a spaceship, is about a rag-tag band of folks on the fringe of the law, as they get dragged into a battle against the oppressive intergalactic government that the captain of that ship (the Han Solo-esque Mal Reynolds) doesn't necessarily want to fight. It is sci-fi action at a very high level, with wonderful writing and directing from the masterful Joss Whedon. (He is responsible for three of the best television series of the last ten years.) <br /> <br />Whether you've seen the series, or not, this is an excellent movie you're sure to enjoy. For fans of the show, I don't have to tell you much, except that the same qualities found on the smaller screen can be seen here to their full effect. The one warning I have to offer here is: be prepared when you watch this movie; it moves quickly and does not pull any punches, emotionally. Do not be fooled by the fact that it is \\"science fiction\\"--it is serious drama. <br /> <br />Five stars.
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|Disappointing, is an understatement with both the film itself and the DVD package.  Chicken Little has a great soundtrack, big name TV stars, Zach Braff (Scrubs) and Adam West (Batman and Family Guy) supplying voices you'd think a great movie result would be a breeze.  Unfortunately the big money must have gone to their salaries and to pay for the songs with only the bottom of the barrel writers being able to be afforded.  Chicken Little struggles for original ideas with characters like Fish being pretty much clones of other characters (Kenny, South Park).  The War of the Worlds is pretty much plagiarised as well by the alien attack scenes.  Throw in the fact that Chicken Little barely passes the hour mark in length and you know there had better be some great bonus features or you've been ripped off.<br /><br />Great bonus features however there aren't, with very poor efforts put into the meagre bonuses included.  As if there is any chance you won't find fish in the Where's Fish? trivia game. Alternative beginnings are mostly hand drawn sketches, they couldn't even bothered creating them.  Save your money for other DVDs.
B00002E23E|5.0|This is one of the most incredible DVD's I have ever seen. It really captures the heart and feeling that Led Zeppelin puts into their songs. The performances of \\"No Quarter,\\" \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" \\"Kashmir,\\" \\"Moby Dick,\\" and of course \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" are all unbelievable. No one should have a music collection without this DVD.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|All I can say is... <br /> <br />Don't judge \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" by its first single, the overplayed \\"Dani California.\\" It's a fun track with a sing-along chorus, but nothing amazing (save for the Hendrix-esque guitar solo by John Frusicante).  <br /> <br />The Chili Peppers are no longer the punk-funk band they were in the '80s, nor are they the rap-metal/punk/thrash band they were in the '90s. That's not necessarily a bad thing; if they keep releasing \\"BloodSugarSexMagik\\" every time out, it can get pretty boring. A great band is one that continues to change their sound while still putting out great music. The Chili Peppers have accomplished this with their more recent efforts, \\"Californication\\" and \\"By The Way,\\" two albums that blend beautiful melodies and harmonies but don't lose the Peppers' funky edge.  <br /> <br />Now, with \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" the Peppers have reached an all-time high. Tracks like \\"She Looks to Me,\\" \\"Snow (Hey Oh),\\" \\"Wet Sand,\\" and \\"Hey\\" are all about self-reflection, a strong theme in this album. The beautiful folk ballad \\"If\\" is melancholic perfection, while \\"Hard to Concentrate\\" is sure to be played in many weddings to come. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Torture Me\\" and \\"Turn It Again\\" are catchy and fun (the latter providing the best guitar solo in the entire album). And don't think the Peppers are going soft on ya... \\"She's Only 18\\" and \\"Readymade\\" are hard-rocking tracks with heavy choruses and amazing drum-and-bass beats.  <br /> <br />As for the funk lovers, there's no shortage of da dunk on the album: \\"Charlie,\\" \\"Tell Me Baby,\\" \\"Storm in a Teacup,\\" and \\"Hump de Bump\\" are all danceable, irresistibly fun songs that hark back to vintage Peppers.  <br /> <br />The Peppers are not one-trick ponies; not satisfied with just crowd-pleasing stuff, their sound continues to evolve. There's quite a lot of experimental (but still listenable) material on here, namely the U2/REM-esque \\"Especially in Michigan\\" (featuring guitar work by the Mars Volta's Omar Rodriguez-Lopez), the sparse-and-heavy \\"Animal Bar,\\" the alien-esque \\"We Believe\\" (featuring a children's chorus), and the ode to Flea's late dog, \\"Death of a Martian.\\"  <br /> <br />The only track that I consider filler is \\"C'Mon Girl,\\" which is an okay song, but does nothing new. Still, ONE SONG out of 28 is pretty great.  <br /> <br />Best Rock Album of 2006, so far.
B000066NW0|5.0|Looking for some depth??? You won't find it here. What you'll find instead is good driving music, plain and simple.
B0001MDQ2G|4.0|Orphaned land are one of the bands that created their own original style of music with the combination of Death Metal and Arabic instruments such as Oud, Kanoon, Tabla, Rek and many more instruments. Beeing a middle-eastern and a listener of classical and new Arabic songs and music, I realized that Orphaned Land used many classical pieces of Egyptian songwriters and composers, for example  the song  \\"Norra el norra\\" was completely taken from the Egyptian musician \\"Karem Mahmoud\\" and the original title of the song is called \\"Samra ya Samra\\" The song refers to a brunette woman which the singer fell in love with but Orphaned Land changed the meaning of the song and its language from arabic to hebrew. Highly recomended for people that love originality. <br /> <br />Peace to all.
B000001EXR|5.0|I am truly blown away. This album floored me. Best album of their career if you ask me. Many die-hard Kiss fans will disagree. This album is about music, good song writing, solid production, and KILLER RIFFS. Pound for pound, riff for riff, this is one of the best albums of the 90s. <br />Carnival isn't a grunge album. It's too heavy and the songs are too well written to fall into that catagory. This is hard rock meets heavy metal designed for the post-thrash 90s. The main riff on \\"Master and Slave\\" would give Tony Iommi nightmares. \\"Hate\\" is Anthrax meets Destroyer-era Kiss.  <br />I also really liked the lyrics. No rocking and rolling all night here. Gene unleashes on the religious right on \\"Hate\\", \\"Seduction of the Innocent\\", and \\"In the Mirror\\".   <br />Check out this from \\"Hate\\": <br /> <br />So you're lookin' for a saviour  <br />But I'm here to tell ya  <br />You gotta save yourself  <br /> <br />Lead a lamb to slaughter  <br />All you ever did was follow orders  <br /> <br />All you martyrs and saviours  <br />Go through the same door  <br />Listen all you butchers, saints and sinners  <br />We've all been here before  <br /> <br />Kulick's solos are some of the best of his career. Last. but not least, Singer proves himself a worthy heir to the throne of Carr. After listening to this, I can see why many people consider him to be the best drummer in modern rock. <br /> <br />This album is really worth picking up and at this price it's a steal. I've heard some people say that Union (Kulick w/ John Corabi) sounds a lot like this. If so, then I gotta check out Union.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Surprised that this isn't your classic Clapton. But Back Home isn't a bad disc. I think that it's about time that he's taking a step back from the every day stuff that's been broadcasted over the airwaves. Don't get me wrong I own everything Clapton. But it's time to let him do what makes him comfortable. How many of you weren't fans of his Nothing but the Blues? Personally I thought that was the man doing what he loved best play'n the Blues. <br />So if you don't care for this one pull out an old commercial airwave tune and enjoy. EC is still putting out the tunes.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|\\"Welcome to the freak show!\\" Those words jump out at you as you put in the cd in the player. From that point on, Edguy takes you on one hell of a ride, the question is, can you hold on? With a combination power metal, 80's hair metal, just plain old good music, this band is guaranteed to make a fan out of even the most picky of metal heads. My perssonal favorites on this album are: \\"Mysteria\\", \\"The Piper Never Dies\\", and \\"We Don't Need A Hero\\". All in all, this band makes great, powerful songs and you will not be dissapointed, one of the best I've heard in awhile. <br />
B00006BTCA|4.0|Interpol's mixture of often passionate music, awkward bridges, generally mediocre lyrics, and contemporary detached \\"cool\\" leaves me less than satisfied. The record is underproduced. Better lyric revision, small changes (like getting rid of the \\"this song is called Stella was a diver...\\" nonsense), and a dedication toward producing a heart-felt and meaningful record instead of a \\"we can toy with you\\" mixture of passion and detachment could have made this a great record. The tunes are there, albeit with flaws. Obstacle 1 is a good example. It is quite strong at times, but has really weak parts as well, and the lyrics don't really convince. The best track on the record is the last one, Leif Erickson.
B0007OASII|5.0|At first for some reason, I did not like this album very much, as it wasn't as epic as The Fourth Legacy. After I put it down for about four months or so, I got bored recently and started to listen to it. Finally, after the fifth time listening to it today, I can officially announce I am obssessed with it. All of the songs are great, I especially like the fact that Shagrath (lead singer to Dimmu Borgir) guest stars on the first song; he plays the part of Lucifer. A lot of the usual emotional vocals and music, plus a female singer also appears more on this cd than the others. When you buy this album, be prepared to go on a journey into the world of Kamelot.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|Let me start off my review by saying this: It is almost impossible to decide on a favorite Megadeth album. I mean when I first bought RIP, that was my favorite 'Deth cd. But then, I got Peace Sells and my thinking got confused. Finally after getting this beauty and Killing is My Business...at the same time, I was even more troubled. All four of those classics that I listed are perfect, say for a few tiny flaws. Instead of telling you that So Far, So Good... is gonna be your favorite Megadeth cd (its so good it might be), I'll just say this is a kickass album that you need to get.<br /><br />Into the Lungs of Hell: One of Megadeth's only instrumentals (if I'm correct the only other is the bonus track Absolution), and sh*t what an instrumental. From the electric/acoustic harmonizing intro to the speed metal guitars that follow, this is a huge favorite. A reasonable 3 minute or so song that doesn't deserve to be skipped. As far as instrumentals go a 10/10.<br /><br />Set the World Afire: Talk about frickin' fast thrash metal songs; this one gets a gold star in that contest! After the little intro, the guitars roar in and shred themselves to death all the way. Smoke must have been shooting out of their hands and amps, and only after the opening \\"shred/riff\\". Interesting lyrics, great solos, and fast paced druming from Chuck equals a should-have-been-greatest hit! 9.5/10<br /><br />Anarchy in the U.K: In my opinion, this is the best cover by Megadeth. I mean they have \\"These Boots\\" which was fast, but it got blown out of the water cause of the beeps, and they have \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" which is not terrible, but it doesn't really fit Megadeth's character. Anyway, this beaut' is a good one. I love the sing-along chorus' and the fast double bass patterns during the solo/interludes. Not bad a'tall; 9/10<br /><br />Mary Jane: I absolutely love this song! It starts right in with a little verse from Dave and it doesn't slow down from there. Love the start/stop riffs and lyrics. Gotta love an underatted, non-greatest hit Megadeth gem! 9/10<br /><br />502: These lyrics have to be the sweetest lyrics on this cd. They're just really inventive and they're something most rockers can relate to. Love this speedy rocker, love the vocals, but get kind of annoyed when everything gets \\"muted\\" so to say and all you hear is sirens and sh*t. Oh well, it's only for a couple seconds and after that it's a sweet part anyway. 9.5/10<br /><br />In My Darekest Hour: This ode to Cliff Burton is one of the sweetest on the cd. I love the intro, and after that it's the electric guitar with a sweet solo kind of flowing over the top of the riff; very awesome! I love the sudden time and rythym change when the chords come crunching out and Dave starts the sweet verse off with \\"I walk alone...\\" Good Stuff! 10/10<br /><br />Liar: One of the fastest on the album and when you think of it quite amusing lyrics about Chris Poland. I'd love to see Mustaine and Chris confront each other on this one. Oh well, that's water under the bridge now, but the fact of the matter is this is a sweet song with the trio chanting \\"Liar\\" at the chorus. Listen to Dave rattle off one of the verses faster than any metal god I've ever seen! 9.5/10<br /><br />Hook in Mouth: A good song! The first chords get ripped out through the amps and after that the galloping drums and fast bass lines get thrown out with Dave's snarling voice. A good rocker from a great band. 9/10<br /><br />>So like I said, it's impossible to decide a favorit cd. Every song on here is good and Megadeth are in their prime here. Get the remastered of this album (I wouldnt bother with the original just for  quality sound's sake) and love this masterpiece!and lyrics. Gotta love an underatted, non-greatest hit Megadeth gem! 9/10 <br /> <br />502: These lyrics have to be the sweetest lyrics on this cd. They're just really inventive and they're something most rockers can relate to. Love this speedy rocker, love the vocals, but get kind of annoyed when everything gets \\"muted\\" so to say and all you hear is sirens and sh*t. Oh well, it's only for a couple seconds and after that it's a sweet part anyway. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />In My Darekest Hour: This ode to Cliff Burton is one of the sweetest on the cd. I love the intro, and after that it's the electric guitar with a sweet solo kind of flowing over the top of the riff; very awesome! I love the sudden time and rythym change when the chords come crunching out and Dave starts the sweet verse off with \\"I walk alone...\\" Good Stuff! 10/10 <br /> <br />Liar: One of the fastest on the album and when you think of it quite amusing lyrics about Chris Poland. I'd love to see Mustaine and Chris confront each other on this one. Oh well, that's water under the bridge now, but the fact of the matter is this is a sweet song with the trio chanting \\"Liar\\" at the chorus. Listen to Dave rattle off one of the verses faster than any metal god I've ever seen! 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Hook in Mouth: A good song! The first chords get ripped out through the amps and after that the galloping drums and fast bass lines get thrown out with Dave's snarling voice. A good rocker from a great band. 9/10 <br /> <br />>So like I said, it's impossible to decide a favorit cd. Every song on here is good and Megadeth are in their prime here. Get the remastered of this album (I wouldnt bother with the original just for  quality sound's sake) and love this masterpiece!
B000FFJ85I|2.0|Okay, so I'm not a hardcore original fan of AFI. And yes, Sing the Sorrow did get me hooked. And yes I bought all the previous releases and enjoyed them also. As soon as I found out that AFI had a new CD out I jumped on it. Now it feels like I jumped on a Media Grenade. After listening to this a few times I realized that it had no spark, no flavor. It was listenable, but it just wasnt AFI. It seems like EVERY track is by a different group. From the first one sounding like 50 Cent, to the second track sounding surprisingly similiar to the first track on Atreyu's new release. Atreyu is another one that I am disappointed in but this is about AFI. Pretty much what this CD boils down to is.... they let the producer and the media get in the way of what makes them special and had them make a CD that would appeal to the masses. So they took the mainstream road and sold out. Period. If you are an AFI fan this CD is NOT worth your money. If you never heard of them before because all you watch is MTV to get your music knowledge, then you may enjoy it.
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|The first movie was one of the best movies of 2004, so all of us expected to see something equal to the first movie, the result was something even better.<br /><br />Evolution is the strongest and the most correct word you can use for this comeback.<br /><br />The multitudinal plot continues to weave an even thicker blanket as reasons why certain things in the first movie were so came to light... why Selene was left alive was already apparently... but why Viktor killed her family... now that comes out in this one.<br />Kate Beckinsale, as always, is stunning and excellent, as is Scott and the rest of the cast. I found the character of Marcus particularly intriguing as well.<br /><br />The story is great, if you follow it well enough through the first movie to this one. The action is excellent. The acting, and no, there isn't a ton of it, but you know what, audible acting is sometimes less important than physical and mental acting, which is a great fine high point in this movie.<br />I gave if five stars because I saw it once in theatres and I positively cannot wait to see it again. I plan on buying it on Pay-Per-View and buying this when it comes out.<br />The ending leaves room for a third movie, and I sincerely hope they make one because this film-franchise deserves a third wind.<br /><br />And yes, as other reviews state, this does pick up right where the first movie left off, after a brief glimpse in to the past to set up the principle behind this movie as well as put some finer points on things discussed, but not really went in to that much, in the first movie. Overall, it is a worth-while watch... I plan on finding myself watching it several times the first day it comes out, because I seriously didn't want to leave the theatre when it ended because I wanted to watch it again.<br /><br />Last but not least, just in the event that by some miracle Kate actually reads Amazon reviews, I love you Kate Beckinsale :-D You're awesome and keep up the great work!
B000FFJ85I|4.0|The thing about this CD is that it, like every album before it, sounds different than every album before it. You can't start listening to it expecting it to sound a certain way, because it won't. You have to listen to it for what it is. In my opinion, it's actually pretty good, and I had very low expectations of it, having loved \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" and having heard \\"Miss Murder\\" beforehand. \\"Miss Murder\\" is, in my opinion, the worst song on the album. It only gets better from there. A couple of songs that stood out to me were \\"Kill Caustic\\", \\"Love Like Winter\\", and \\"Endlessly, She Said\\". It's nothing absolutely groundbreaking, but most people should find this an enjoyable album.
076790592X|1.0|Tuesday's with Morrie is a book that philosophizes about death and enlightenment. The book in my honest opinion is not for youth. It seems like a book with not enough passion for young readers. After the author describes Morrie's condition as he slowly dies I found myself not caring after a while and found reading the book as a tedious task. There was never a point in which I was totally involved in the book. Some people might view this as an emotional tale, and say it's a touching book, but this is hard to imagine. This book seems dry of any thing vaguely close to gripping emotion. I don't know which age group to recommend this book for, maybe for the older readers who no longer have good taste in books or are feeling that they connect with Morrie, and his disease. Now im not saying that if you are required to read this book you are going to go through hell and back, but there are definitely better choices.
087349976X|5.0|I borrowed this book along with several others from the public library and this is the one I decided to buy. The first three reviews don't make any sense to me and I agree with Simone/Simona that it is a wonderful book. I am new to wire and bead jewelry and so the first thing I did was to  learn some of the wire techniques in the front of the book. The projects all refer back to these techniques, and the beautiful and clear photos make it easier yet. I like making wire chains and this is giving me lots of practice and is making me feel like I could \\"master\\" this craft. I hope the author does a \\"next\\" book, I love the variety of designs and am challenged to improve my skills in order to be able to do any of them. Every time I page through it I find new ideas to try. I recommend this book to beginners and anyone who wants ideas.
0838577016|5.0|I am a Female Reconstructive Surgeon who while reading a diversified field of topics have fallen very fond of a particular work.  This is Principles of Neural Science.  having just completed the 2000 edition I can guarrantee that the new edition due June 2006 will be even more captivatiing.  If you have the opportunity to see Dr Kandel speak please do he is an academic historian who gives a broad history of each critical piece of medical history to each of his topics.  But returning to  his epic, Principles of Neural Science is akin to Newtons Principia in that is a sublime masterpiece.  The Kandell prose is colorful, smooth and insightful for medical science.  I have  found it easy to read 100-200 pages a day so that the 1400 page book took only a week to discover.  The illustrations are the best for any field of Medicine and I have read alll the classics- Harrisions & Cecils Medicine and Schwartz and Sabistons General Surgery neither of these books elucidates the subjugate field with this type of clarity and instructional prose.  Do as I have done and preorder the new edition.  Those with any interest in the brain will certainly be amazed at the easy depth of information you will achieve.  Believe me  I am writing a book -Female Reconstructive Surgery and I will be implementing operative 17.2 million pixel photography to achieve the splendid vision the Kandel has produced with his illustrations.  I have learned so much on how a book for Surgeons should be written from this Nobel Laureate
B000002H33|5.0|I think its funny how an earlier review stated: <br /> <br />\\"Disposable Heros\\" -10/10 * Oh man, the songs just keep getting worse. This is some kind of Full-Metal Jacket ripp-off.*  <br /> <br />Full Metal Jacket came out in 1989 three years after this CD.  <br /> <br />Well I love this cd. It was the first Metal CD I ever bought, and pretty much got me into metal, along with Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Orion is one of the best instrumentals ever, along with Yngwie Malmsteen's Far Beyond The Sun and Opeth's To Bid U Farewell! Don't buy Snt. Anger it sucks! And R.I.P. Cliff. <br /> <br />
B000FILW86|4.0|After 33 years and 16 studio albums amassing more than 20 million sales Cheap Trick has finally got around to saluting that little town we both call home with their latest release Rockford. <br />Lead singer Robin Zander suggested the title after deciding that it was past due that the power pop rockers gave a little recognition to our fair city and the acclaim has extended as far and wide as the Nationally syndicated Conan O'Brien show who introduced the band as \\"Pride of Rockford, Illinois\\" <br />Rick, Robin, Tom and Bun certainly have not been diminished by age, working as hard on the tour circuit today as in their heyday when \\"I want you to want me\\", \\"Dream Police\\" and later \\"The Flame\\" made them the darlings of record executives everywhere. Of course those days have moved on and nowadays the band have left the big labels behind and do their own production with help from the likes of Steve Albini, Linda Perry (on \\"Perfect stranger\\" the first single) and Jack Douglas.  <br />The album comes out of the blocks fast with `Welcome to the world' and continues to rock with `Perfect Stranger', which is reminiscent of some of the bands earlier hits. `If it takes a lifetime' takes it back just a notch and is perhaps a little syrupy with the harmonizing however it's not long before it's full steam ahead with the jet fuelled `Come on, come on, come on'. `O Claire' starts in a sparsely backed falsetto that could have come straight out of the 70's but still sounds fresh and relevant. `This time we got it' driven by a solid beat from Bun and a catchy chorus while `Give it away' gives Rick Neilsen's axe a solid workout.' One more' is a funky jam from the ghetto with a chorus that is very distinct from the verses. `Every Night, everyday' is a tad overblown and overproduced and Robin camps it up a little too much but manages to redeem himself again on `Dream the Night away' which has to be a strong candidate to the second single. <br />`All those years' does not reflect on the bands previous lack of recognition of their hometown but deals with the loneliness of life on the road away from home. `Decaf' closes out the album and is just so-so for this non-coffee aficionado. <br />Overall it's a solid piece of work and I hope it turns out to be a big success for the boys who have more than paid their dues. Rock on Rockford..... <br />
B000059TEP|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies of all time. Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore) are deeply in love, when they are seemingly victims of a mugging gone wrong. Sam chases after the mugger, and returns to find Molly cradling him in her arms. He then passes up a trip to heaven to stay on Earth and investigate things. He soon learns that it was no random act, and he manages to get through to medium Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg). It is through her that he manages to communicate to Molly the danger she is in, and the adventure continues. This is a perfect blend of fantasy, comedy, adventure, and mystery. You will want to watch this masterpiece again and again.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Moronic and self indulgent Keanu Reeves vanity project lacks the heart and the wits of the comic book which it steals most of it's ideas form and ruins them with a horrible acting performance by Keanu Reeves, which looks more like he's reading from cue cards than remembering a script. The rest of the actors do better in their roles than he does with Rachel Weisz stealing the show with a deep and strong performance, Gavin Rossdale, doing a very convincing job as an agent of the underworld and Djmon Hounsou giving a bit role more class than he should have. Tilda Swinton does well with a small role that is very underwritten and Shia LaBeouf is well, Shia LaBeouf. Don't expect any more than that. <br /> <br />Skip it, you will thank yourself later.
B000F0V0LI|4.0|This Ultimate Collectors Edition is a fine release, however, there was also a two disc special edition released in conjunction with the Ultimate edition.  Both Versions, in terms of special features, are the same.  The only thing the Ultimate has that the two disc doesn't are production photo's,a comic of the Searchers, and production notes from the films director, John Ford.  So if you want to save yourself some money, and get an almost identical product, purchace the two disc special, if you want the prestige of owning the Ultimate Edition(recomended for die-hard fans)go ahead and spend the extra money.
B000B0WODA|5.0|The new LP is more daring and mature than the much hyped album debut.  The lyrics from The Fallen, Eleanor or YCHSMB show an intelligent band far away from the early descriptions of a \\"party boys\\" band. They even try some new musical directions in songs like: Walk Away, Fade Together and Eleanor.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|This is hands down, the album of the year.  Every song is a mini-masterpiece.  After you buy the album sit down and listen to each and every song.  The music of Beirut fills your head and awakens your soul.  It's an experience listening to this album and an experience you'll want to re-live over and over and over.....If you don't see this album on top ten lists all over the globe I'd find myself in state of bewilderment.  The only way that could happen is if nobody got the chance to listen to Gulag Orkestar.  Buy it, buy it, buy it.  It's different but these days it's just what we need. <br />If you need a song to start with:  Mount Wroclai - if you like it you'll love the rest.  Guaranteed.
B000000P17|5.0|The Spaghetti Incident? is a tight album. I love the megalomaniac GN'R numbers with huge sound on their other albums, but this one is great for it's back-to-roots punk numbers delivered in full force. The covers are better than the originals, which weren't bad themselves (I checked the originals out, like they suggest). If I have a bad day and put this album on the world's right with me again. The sheer energy and the FU attitude is pretty cleansing. The album is avoid of any \\"fat\\". It's a lean mean rock'n'roll machine.
B000EPR7NE|4.0|I'm not a heavy-duty book reader, so there was no surprise that I fell into the minority group of people who hadn't read the book before seeing the movie.  But I was intrigued with the plot and after hearing my sister tell me how she couldn't put the book down because it was \\"that good,\\" I decided I just needed to see the movie.<br /><br />And see it I did.  However, I was not ready to be blown away by the music.  As many have stated here, this score just surrounds you with a rich and hypnotic mix of orchestral sound that makes you live and feel each moment that you see on the screen.  I love violins and french horns.  Track 13, \\"Chevaliers De Sangreal,\\" which is played near the end of the movie, will sky-rocket you into Heaven.  The shear volume alone will give you chills!  For that very reason, this is a must-have CD.  I can't stop playing it!!  Enjoy!
B000FGGE68|5.0|Hey, people, this isn't meant to be a complex, psychological, mind twisting movie, it is just meant to entertain the audience. Even a 10 year old has more sense then you people. <br /> <br />But it's goal is not to have a complex plot, but to be full of explosions, head twisting effects and crazy stunts. It is a good action/sci-fi movie, in which Milla Jovovich plays \\"Violent\\". I am just amazed that in todays world look at the advancement of medical science. <br /> <br />The CGI effects could have been done better, there are scenes with the motorcycle that simply look like an old moto gp game. That's the only part of the movie I hate. <br /> <br />They must won't make a \\"Resident Evil 3\\", so maybe that's where the \\"Ultraviolent\\" comes in.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Although when you listen to music and you like a group, you want to be able to recognize their particular sound, the songs in this CD are too much the same as previous work.  Disappointing.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|So, Rob Zombie's been kinda going downhill here lately.  His first solo album was pretty hit and miss, and the one after that was pretty forgettable altogether.  I've been missing the glory days of White Zombie, and well, those days are obviously over, but \\"Educated Horses\\" sees Mr. Zombie going into new, and much more interesting directions.  A lot more diversity here (there's even an acoustic song, if you can believe that!), and better songs than we've heard from him in a while.  But, if you are missing the good old days, \\"American Witch\\" is the good old fun, trashy, rocking Rob Zombie we all know and love. <br /> <br />So anyway, good album, if you want to hear him trying something new.  Also, I'm glad he stopped wearing that weird gray hair dye.  That was just lame.
B000FILW86|5.0|Never would I have thought in 2006 that Cheap Trick would find their swagger.  No longer sounding like a group trying to have a hit nor trying to be overly rock and roll, Cheap Trick finally sound like vintage Cheap Trick.  Well done!  Lovers of power pop and late 70's Cheap Trick will enjoy this cd.
B000063CMK|5.0|Hey, just wanted to write a review for Pain of Salvation on Daniel Gildenlow's birthday.  This album is really amazing, their second best next to TPE.  If you haven't heard it, you should definitely buy it (although if you haven't heard them before, get TPE first). <br /> <br />So anyway, that's it.  One of the best albums ever, by anyone, for sure.
B00002Z88D|4.0|I don't actually have this album, nor have I even listened to any of it, but I was hanging out in Berkeley at the park across from Berkeley High when they were there playing a concert which included the symphony orchestra and which I believe is also where they recorded most of the music for this album. It sounded so cool, I wish I had gone with the kids that snuck in to the show via the school's roof...
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead's most accessible album. <br /> <br />Planet Telex-9/10 Great intro track <br />The Bends-9.5/10 Good studio recording, awesome live. <br />High and Dry-9.5/10 Cool acoustic guitar <br />Fake Plastic Trees-10/10 Heartfelt song <br />Bones-8.5/10 Least favorite song on the album <br />Nice Dream-10/10 Cool chord progression, awesome bridge. <br />Just-10/10 Great song awesome live <br />My Iron Lung-10/10 See above <br />Bulletproof-9.5/10 Slow, great song <br />Black Star-10/10 Excellent. <br />Sulk-9/10 Weak for this album but still great by normal standards. <br />Street Spirit-10/10 A great closer. Brings the album back home.  <br /> <br /> <br />Final Rating: 10/10, or 5/5 whatever you want to call it.  A must  own.
006441034X|5.0|Sophie is the eldest of three sisters, which everyone knows is terribly unlucky. When the Witch of the Waste turns up and transforms Sophie into an old woman, things go from bad to worse!<br /><br />Sophie goes to seek help from the Wizard Howl and discovers that he is not what many believe him to be. Will she ever be able to gain help to break the spell?<br /><br />Full of memorable characters and quirky situations, Howl's Moving Castle is a fully-fleshed fantasy enjoyable for readers 13 and up.
B00005JKG7|4.0|I was very suprised when I saw this movie. First of all, it was way better than the remake. It had a better happening(like how stuff happend in the movie).It was just better, I can't explain it. <br />It is of course abot a city in Oregon that weirdly gets trapped in a cloud of fog that has a strange presence of a ghost lurking around somewhere in it. But people try to figure out the story behind it and the strange secret that one of them left behind. <br />Now, if you like the remake, you will like this one more. It had a better story. I recommend it to people who like horror films
B000FFJ85I|1.0|The only people who will enjoy this album are those who like their music stale, unoriginal and who are below the age of sixteen. <br /> <br />I listened to each of the samples and I honestly couldn't find anything redeeming about this album. The screaming is really contrived, the guitar playing insipid and the lyrics are full of angst. In fact I don't know how anybody around my age could write such bad lyrics and actually take themselves seriously. If I want to hear somebody whining about life I'll listen to The Smiths.Who, by the way, were a much more talented band. <br /> <br />This is just another example of a band trying to cash in on a marketed subculture and on a specific demographic. 'Emo', which is a cheap imitation of goth, is the latest trend so AFI have decided to get over styled haircuts and change their musical direction to fit into the stereotype. Good job guys! <br /> <br />Ronan Harris, of VNV Nation, helped them with this album. Harris is an unoriginal synthpop hack, so the fact that this album smells so bad shouldn't suprise people who are in the know. <br /> <br />Don't buy this album. You will be just encouraging the band to make even more horrendous albums.
0307277674|5.0|The DaVinci Code is a very interesting book. It keeps the reader interested and amazed at some of the facts. There's never a part where there is no action.
6304779607|4.0|A \\"get what you pay for\\" Dirty Harry clone in which Sly tosses out a few too many tough guy one-liners, basically.  Perhaps I'm over-analyzing the thing, but watch closely as buttoned-down Andrew Robinson, best known for his \\"Scorpio\\" serial sniper in Clint's original vigilante cop hit referenced above, has a moment when, after being accosted by Sly's Cobretti, snarls, \\"HE'S the psycho!!\\"  A clever intentional line?  who knows? lol
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I don't really care for historically accurate storylines. I watch a movie for its own merits. Good casting. Great action sequences. Solid storytelling. Beautiful locales. <br /> <br />And TROY delivers all of this and more. <br /> <br />From beginning to end, TROY takes you on a rollor-coaster ride full of huge battle sequences, (some of the very best ever seen on the silver screen, in fact!), and Brad Pitt actually looks convincing here. The Hulk's Eric Bana is utterly fantastic in here. When he and Brad Pitt battle it out, it is classic, vintage fighting the likes of Kill Bill's Quentin Tarintino would salivate for. <br /> <br />This is by far director Wolfgang Peterson's finest film to date. One of the very best in this genre. The DVD is great, and looks awesome on my 65-inch Hi-Def TV.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Simply put, the best TOOL album to date.  LISTEN do not hear!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|When I first heard this album, I thought, \\"what the heck is that\\".  I'm a big Radiohead fan so this was definitely not my type of music but after hearing the above titled song over and over again on MTV, I bought the CD.  Now it's a fixture in my boombox.  It's definitely not Disco music as you might think by the title.  It has a unique sound in every single song.  Some of the instrumentals just blow you away (song 11) and I just hope we begin to see more music from this band.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|This CD is amazing. There are some things like NO SECRET SONG!!! that disappointed me (they are usually my favorites), but thats o.k. True AFI Fans know to roll with the punchs with AFI. We know what to expect before we hear it while others take it as a shock. Real fans understand the CD and embrace it, while others just dont get it. Thats the unique thing about AFI. They are very fan orientated, and give us exactly what we want (look at the despair faction). The lyrics are among the best, and song writing and vocals are at top form. This CD falls perfectly in sequence after STS, and I cant wait to see whats next. CASUAL FANS BE WARNED. This album will test you to see how far you are willing to go with them on their journey through change, and I have a feeling this is where we see alot of people stop that journey and find something else. DONT EXPECT the second coming of SHUT YOUR MOUTH, or BLACK SAILS. Id be surprised to see any heavier songs on their next release (which I hope to see soon...)
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This album is so refreshing. I can't beleive it took me so long to even hear about it. It is so forward and out of the box. I hope they collaborate more often. My only complaint is that it too short.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|This is a satire, a parody or whatever you want to call it. It is meant ot be funny and not this great, serious commentary on the politics of the time. Its meant to be funny and crude, not a Dickensian masterpiece. Also because it is a comedy you should not take it so seriously, this movie is not some attack/conspiracy against you and your beliefs.  <br /> <br />Also the songs are hilarious.
0634060384|5.0|I thought this book was great. I've brought it on quite a few pay gigs, and the other guys I sat in with (except one) were playing out of THIS book. It's legal... can't beat that. It also has most of the songs all the other ones did with very very few changes. There is no problem changing a few of the chords here and there to make them like the old real books if you are an old real book purist, but mark my words... this LEGAL real book is the book everyone will be playing out of in 5 years. Happy playing.
0786890762|5.0|What a GREAT book! I couldn't put it down (literally...I finished it in a couple of hours)! While reading the book, I felt like I became a part of Rosie's life--from her emotional tolls with motherhood, and the death of her parents, I felt that I was right there alongside her throughout all of her struggles! <br /> <br />I HIGHLY reccommend!
B0000026WD|2.0|I was a huge fan of MJ when I was in college but gone are those real immature days. MJ was good in Off the wall, Thriller and Bad was definitely good but Dangerous was a huge disappointment. Only a few songs in the middle order are a pleasure to listen to otherwise in the closet, jam, why you wanna trip on me and the others are a bogus list. Will you be there stands out of the album. Black or white, Who is it, Give in to me are exceptional songs. Dont buy this album save your money. A rather discouraging effort by MJ. Sure is
B000FILW86|5.0|I've had this CD for a month now, so I feel I can really give an accurate rating.  Absolutely a 5 star rating, like Tom said, Rockford offers all the best elements of classic Cheap Trick, no doubt.  I haven't been able to stop listening to it multiple times everday. I'm astonished a band this far into their career can still produce music of this amazing quality. Zander is the man.  How does his voice continue to sound this great after all these years?  Without a doubt, Robin Zander is the greatest singer I've ever heard in my life.  Unlike Special One, Cheap Trick open with the perfect song this time.  Short, sweet, celebratory, and to the point.  Low Life In High Heels was the perfect opener for Special One with Hummer as the Reprise.  How could they mess that up?  At least every song on Special One was great, so all is forgiven. 97 is still my favorite of the last three releases, but Rockford comes oh so close.  Rockford is absolutely the greatest release of 2006, so get it today!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|AFI has always been a good, powerful band. And whoever said Sing the Sorrow was no good then you are simply not an AFI fan. With the release of their new album, there is, if not anything to complain about! \\"Tailor-made for MTV\\" I'm sorry but that really is a bunch of senseless misunderstanding. Get real. <br /> <br />95% of the tracks on this album are excellent. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone. Yes, maybe they have gone a bit mainstream. But isn't the point of being in a band to make money? I think that is what they're aiming at. <br /> <br />\\"Miss Murder\\" is a well-written, listenable, and rather addictive song. Well done AFI. <br /> <br />Ignore those bad false and biased reviews. This is an acceptable album and it was well worth the wait.
B00005JOVH|1.0|Worse than its predecessors, it achieves quick oblivion. Incapable of transmitting any feelings, it's basically a catalogue of clich&eacute;s, with the drama of a high school play.<br /><br />Basically, it's yet another instance of the extremely old US philosophy of \\"nobody's above the law\\". One character, invariably evil, selfish and a bit seductive, thinks he's better than the rest of humanity. He/ she embodies \\"Struggle for the fittest\\". In less than two hours, he's dead or in jail and unrepentant. The \\"tolerant\\" selfless view prevails, and you go home to your Darwinian job and life, even thinking you've learnt something useful.<br /><br />Like \\"Charlie's angels 3\\", there are separate duels to make things last even longer (Iceman and Pyro, Storm and \\"Callisto\\" the Latin woman who moves fast). It has the aesthetics of a 50's corny film, like those of Liz Taylor in Rome or the like :).<br /><br />The \\"political message\\" is so diluted and SO politically correct that it has less power of rebellion than a Che Guevara T-shirt.

B000ESSTKG|1.0|For whatever reason, Rhino decided to leave off the SACD layer of all three U.S. Depeche Mode re-releases, which is a real shame.  If you have an SACD set-up, the audio quality of the import versions is noticeably better (especially on \\"Speak & Spell\\").  Plus the DVD is region free, so the import video will still play in your PC or Mac (although it will not play on your TV, unless you have a DVD player that can convert PAL to NTSC).

0446310786|5.0|In the book, To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee shows the values in life that we should all go by. Scout, a young girl, her brother Jem, and Atticus Finch are a family that lives in the early 1900's in a small town called Maycomb. It's a racist town that discriminates against black people. Their father takes on a trial of defending a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been tried with rape. He feels that is morally right, and that it would be a sin to not do it, just like killing a mockingbird, one of the most harmless animals on earth. My reaction to the Novel was that I feel like we all live life in the way that we shouldn't. We should use the sang \\"It's a Sin to kill a mockingbird\\". To me, it's a way of expressing how we should treat each other. We should all help each other out, even in the worst possible situations. We should help someone, even if the people around us will hate us for it. It would be something that would be right to do and it would be a nice thing for our life. It also makes me take life a little bit slower. We shouldn't rush through things just to get it done, and we shouldn't rush through it so we don't have to experience the pain/sorrow. We should all help each other. I recommend this because we could all learn something from it. How it can help us later and now in life. How we can help people in need. It's a very good book that anyone would enjoy. It will take you to a place that you would least expect to read about in the active life we live today. It would teach us true meanings about life. Anyone can read it, and they will probably like it. I didn't want to read it at first, and it thought it would be boring. But I got into it quickly and it taught me something and I never expected to.
1400079179|2.0|Ok, I read it just because of the controversy.  A lady at church handed out \\"rebuttal\\" books to everyone and I figured if I'm going to read the rebuttal, I need to know what it's rebutting.<br /><br />I don't read many bad books, but this was one.  It wasn't quite as bad as Tim LaHaye's \\"Babylon Rising\\" at least.  I finished this book and it is a page turner, even if it's completely unbelievable.<br /><br />The only good thing was the way Dan Brown laid down clues leading you suspect very different people than the actual perpetrators.  I liked that because just when I thought I had it all figured out, I had my brain tweaked by a big twist.<br /><br />However, it's just bad fiction.  The characters do things that make no sense, and are way smarter than is believable.  And while I can enjoy revisionist history, you need to have the historical facts right in order for people to suspend their disbelief when you start rewriting the things in dispute.  I've read a lot about church history and Dan Brown gets sooo many things wrong.  Rewriting well-known historical facts (such as what Constantine did and did not do) makes the rest of the novel less enjoyable.<br /><br />In short, it's not just bad theology that makes this book bad.  I can overlook bad theology for the sake of a good story.  But the DaVinci Code is a sloppy bit of fiction with plot holes big enough to drive a truck through.  (For example, why does Langdon run upstairs to talk to Sophie when he should be focussed on escaping the police?)  Bad theology aside, it's not even good fiction, and therefore, surprizingly forgettable.  I won't be reading any more Dan Brown books.<br /><br />Yeah yeah, I know most people will find my review \\"unhelpful\\" simply because I don't say what they want me to.  Get over it.
0385720920|4.0|This was my first Palahniuk novel and I'm not quite sure where to put it.  Victor Mancini is an anamoly that I still haven't quite managed to figure out after finishing this novel.  I feel like the half-digested morsels of food that he uses to choke himself and lure others into a false sense of savior-dom leading them to send him the checks he uses for subsistence.  However, all things considered, this novel had its good points.  I can usually smell a twist ending coming a mile away, but I never saw it coming with this one.  Palahniuk's writing is satirical almost to the point of being reminiscent of Jonathan Swift in A Modest Proposal, which is both refreshing and annoying in equal measure.  I was about halfway through the book before I got used to his style, but it didn't disappoint.  I mean, who doesn't love a guy who chokes on little bits of food so he can make money to keep his mother in a nursing home. That's love, right? Those who are always raving about him.... I get it now.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Underworld: Evolution does the first movie better in every respect.  More action, more detailed story, more guns and Selene is more human.  The special effects are fantastic.  The only thign I noticed was that the ship in the movie is a miniature.  There's something in the way the water moves around a miniature that you can tell right away.  It doesn't retract from the movie however.  The only other complaint I have is that Michael's fights seem a bit strained in a couple of spots, like he's not as tough as the movie would have him be.  But then again, I guess that ties in with his character not being a fighter at all but still learning to cope with his new abilities and having to fight.  So I can't fault the movie for that.  I learned after watching the movie that the helicopter was mostly a miniature.  Amazing.  I've never seen better CGI than this movie.  In some spots you can tell, but there are other spots that are totally realistic and you can't tell at all.  It's excellent entertainment and a worthy sequel.  The DVD comes with a series of featurettes that shows how the movie was made, some of the concepts, stunts and special effects.  When you see what all went into this movie and that they didn't use CGI for everything, but also miniatures and other lesser special effects you get an appreciation for the time and effort put into this sequel.  Thumbs up.
B000A32KJQ|4.0|\\"Neighbourhood\\" by Manu Katche, with Jan Garbareck, Tomasz Stanko, Marcin Wasilewski and Slawomir Kurkiewicz - 2005, ECM Label. <br /> <br />Drummer, Manu Katche, has been making a name for himself as one of the world's better drummers. That may be a matter of opinion but I confess I do like him pretty much. I would describe his style as `soft-spoken'. I first heard the cut \\"February Sun\\" from this CD on Cable Radio before I ordered it. I love the Scandinavian Jazz genre from the ECM label so when I saw the incredible artists accompanying Katche, ordering this CD was a no-brainer for me. <br /> <br />This CD is a bit of a departure from the typical ECM album. This is an easy album to listen to, maybe a little too easy for some. The music is quiet, moody, melodic and perhaps not-very-challenging for some of you. When my wife first heard a few cuts, she said \\"that's nice music\\". She hates avant guard jazz so that should give you an idea just how smooth this CD is.  <br /> <br />Some negative reviewers complained that this CD was nothing more than smooth jazz but that misses the mark. There's more here than just smooth jazz. Jan Garbareck, Tomasz Stanko and Marcin Wasilewski on piano keep it interesting enough. Manu Katche's drumming is quite good and he manages to stay out of the way of the other musicians. I like bassist Slawomir Kurkiewicz playing on this CD as well. The group as a whole reminds me a bit of the Swedish group E.S.T. <br /> <br />If you can imagine, Jan Garbareck, and Tomasz Stanko, playing with E.S.T. then you can imagine what the group sounds like. Those two horn players do some really nice work together and are worth the price of the CD alone. <br /> <br />My modest system (hybrid tube-integrated and MMG speakers) gives a very nice sweet presentation of this type of music. It's detailed enough to bring Katche's percussion forward and give the horns a biting presence. Plus it does a fantastic job of realistically imaging small jazz groups like this.<br /> <br />I recommend the CD for those that want a laid back change of pace, especially if you're a Jan Garbareck, and/or Tomasz Stanko fan. <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|What a great film! I loved the score, I loved the cinematography, and I loved the casting.<br /><br />Kiera Knightley made a wonderful Elizabeth Bennet, and Matthew Macfadyen was a superb Darcy. Both of their performances were great. Macfadyen seemed to understand that, at first, Darcy had to be quite an unlikable character. However, as the movie progresses, the viewer (as well as Lizzie) learns more about him and grows to like him. It seems that, sometimes, actors are afraid to fully embody those unlikable characters unless they know they are playing the villain. But there are plenty of unlikable people in everyday life who are not villains. They are just cold, or boorish, or rude, or whatever. There are LOTS of folks with no bad intentions who are just plain draggy to be with.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how the movie stayed true to the spirit novel we've all known and loved, without become a slave to the book. (After all, movies and books are quite different mediums, and audiences change drastically over time.) I haven't seen much else that Joe Wright, the director, has done, but you can bet I'll be keeping an eye on him for the future.<br /><br />Near the end of the film, Darcy comes walking out of the morning mist, long coattails flapping in the breeze, to tell Lizzie that she has bewitched him, body and soul. Now, why on earth hasn't anyone said that to me lately? ~sigh.~
B000F1IQN2|4.0|Director:  Steven Spielberg <br />Cast:  Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz, Hanns Zischler, Ayelet Zurer, Geoffrey Rush, Gila Almagor, Michael Lonsdale, Mathieu Amalric. <br />Running Time:  164 minutes <br />Rated R for Rated R for strong graphic violence, some sexual content, nudity and language. <br /> <br />\\"Munich\\" is, on the whole, a straight forward hit-man movie. The assignments are handed out; the team is assembled, each with their own specialty; and they travel about Europe plotting and carrying out their hits. We have the inevitable paranoia, the double agents and suspicious loyalties. So far, so familiar. Only \\"Munich\\" is wrapped in the thin veneer of 'history' and 'fact', and mob bosses and corporate espionage is replaced with Middle Eastern politics and Israeli-Arab relations. I mention this because the politics of \\"Munich\\" are really nothing more than a topical plot devise, used the same way as cold-war relations and soviet villainy was used thirty years ago. <br /> <br />What should have been an uneventful Olympics in Munich, 1972, became the bloodshed that unfolded like a Moebius strip and unleashed even more blood unto the world. On September 5, 1972, eight Palestinian terrorists killed two Israeli athletes, kidnapped nine more, and asked for safe passage out of Germany and the subsequent liberation of Arab prisoners in Israeli and German prisons. Once at the airport they encountered resistance from the German authorities, and in a scuffle, all of the other nine hostages were killed.  This led to the Israeli government to have the Mossad -- Israel's intelligence agency -- track down and kill every terrorist responsible for the killings. For this they hired one of Golda Meir's bodyguards, known as Avner (Eric Bana), put him in a special ops team, and gave them minimal information about these terrorists. Avner on his own is able to strike back at the \\"supposed\\" terrorists via the appearance of a shady Parisian named Louie (Mathieu Almaric), but as the assignments become more and more difficult, he wonders if it is all worth it, and once his own team gets decimated by counter-agents, he wonders if behind every terrorist there is a even more dangerous one just waiting in the wings with ways to get back at him and his family. <br /> <br />What prevents 'Munich' becoming just a generic updated-cold-war thriller is the sheer quality of the production. From the flawless recreation of European capitals in the early seventies to the impeccable costume design to the beautiful cinematography - \\"Munich\\" is a visually fascinating movie. The performances are universally outstanding, with Bana in particular bringing a sense of tough nobility that seems to be his forte. The script is intelligent and thought-provoking, and it is screenwriter Tony Kushner's focus on the emotional and psychological landscape of his characters rather than the details of political contract killing, that ultimately lifts the movie above the generic. The kind of self-consciously poetic prose for which he is known, so often seeming unrealistically erudite, is kept to a minimum, and when it does appear, is so beautifully written and performed that all reservations are forgotten.  Ultimately, the greatest praise must be reserved for Spielberg, who has, with \\"Munich\\", created perhaps the second truly adult movie of his career (the first being the incredible \\"Schindler's List\\"). We see no signs of his trademark sentimentality, his descents into fantasy, his childish simplification of motivation. With this film, he embraces ambiguity and complexity, and as a result, has invited criticism from those who prefer their drama simplistically black and white. Above all, one can't help but wonder what the Spielberg oeuvre would look had he not dedicated his career to kid's movies, fantasies and feel-good sci-fi. \\"Munich\\" is an intelligent and gripping thriller that was a major contender for award recognition, and deservedly so.
B000002J2D|4.0|Following the departure of guitarist Steve Hackett in 1977, Genesis released this 1978 album as a three piece.  Apparently they were not interested in replacing Steve and instead filled the hole with tons of synthesizers.  Specifically, Tony had just purchased a new Polymoog synthesizer and it's fantastic tones can be heard all over the album.  In addition, Mike added six-string guitar parts along with some rather nice leads (he actually does a great job).  Although the band members themselves feel that this album has not aged as well as the others from this period, I have to admit that I like it quite a lot.<br /><br />And Then There Were Three marks a point where musical styles such as British symphonic pop are being embraced, although the sheer virtuosity that attracted me to the band is still present, albeit in a somewhat reduced form (tracks range from 3-7 minutes).  For example, the opening track Down and Out is in 5/8 and Phil's thunderous drum part on this piece is especially intricate, not to mention Tony's remarkable synth solo.  In fact, this piece was so difficult to play that they soon dropped it from the live set.  Other favorite tracks that feature classic Genesis songwriting (think Tony Banks here) include Deep in the Motherlode, The Lady Lies, and especially Burning Rope.  At the other end of the spectrum are several softer pieces including the synthesizer heavy Many too Many (which is a favorite), the romantic smash hit Follow You, Follow Me, and Say it's Alright Joe, which is a bit too maudlin for my liking, but is still good nonetheless.  I guess it is worth noting that most of the pieces are Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford solo pieces - very little effort went into group composition, which they would return to on the Duke album (1980).<br /><br />With respect to this remastered version it features good sound quality and includes the lyrics to each song.  Although Rhino has recently remastered this album (in 2007) it is a bit expensive.  Moreover, some folks have commented on the severe compression used on the 2007 remaster of ...And Then There Were Three.<br /><br />While this album pretty much gets slammed left, right, and center by most of my fellow proggers,  I feel that there is enough of the \\"Genesis thing\\" going on that it makes for very enjoyable listening.

0790733226|5.0|Director:  Robert Zemeckis <br />Cast:  Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skerritt, James Woods, Angela Bassett, John Hurt, David Morse, William Fichtner, Geoffrey Blake, Sami Chester, Timothy McNeil. <br />Running Time:  153 minutes <br />Rated PG for some intense action, mild language and a scene of sensuality. <br /> <br />All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time. Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them. \\"Contact\\", directed by Robert Zemeckis (\\"Forrest Gump\\", \\"Back to the Future\\"), is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young. And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us. Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space. It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be. Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them. And to her, two-plus-two will always be five. <br /> <br />Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book. It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life: A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth.  Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain. But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form. And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you. <br /> <br />Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is. Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities. There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination. In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.  The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel). Zemeckis dida brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis. Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film. Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, `Contact' will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey. It's what the magic of the movies is all about. <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|As many of you may know, this band is very talented, and it really shows here.  The idea if a diuble disc with 1 being loud and the other soothing is just groundbreaking.  Every song from the screams of In Your Honor to the gutar noodlings on Razor will just blow your mind away.  If you buy the cd, and just put it in a stereo it will work just fine, but of course all you Ipod people have to do it the hard way and try to download it.  It wont work and it makes you mad, I think downloading is a waste.  Just buy the CD at the store and enjoy.

B000FILW86|3.0|Now for a review from someone who isn't a Cheap Trick fanatic. <br /> <br />Ever since they've bounced around from label to label, Cheap Trick has not put out the best records, but they make a good recovery with Rockford. The band plays with more conviction in years, even if the material isn't always worthy of it. Robin, Rick, and Bun E. capture the classic sound that made them back in the late 70's with a blend sounds that are Beatle-esque. Some of the songs are memorable like Perfect Stranger and If It Takes A Lifetime even if it sounds strangely close to Tonight It's You. C'mon C'mon is a headbanger that gets to your head. And while CT has been known to write a good ballad, Oh Claire comes up short and oddly forgettable. Still worth giving the CD a listen to. Lord knows with all these hard rock wannabees coming out today, they all should listen to Cheap Trick as the masters still know how to get it (mostly) right.
0396085733|5.0|As one would expect from an Agatha Christie novel, \\"Death on the Nile\\" is a fast-paced, intricately plotted mystery.  With a wide cast of characters, Christie plumbs the depths of mystery writing standards, using red herrings that not only confuse the characters but confound the reader as well.  \\"Death on the Nile\\" is a superb example of a crime so simple that it might just be too difficult to figure out...or is it?<br /><br />When the reader first meets Linnet Ridgeway, she has everything - beauty, brains, money, and soon enough, her best friend's fiance, Simon Doyle.  The newly married couple embark upon their honeymoon, only to discover the jilted fiance/friend, Jacqueline, seeking revenge at every turn.  When Linnet Doyle is found murdered aboard the 'S.S. Karnak', Jacqueline is immediately the primary suspect, but she has a concrete alibi.  Hercule Poirot must use his somewhat maddening powers of deduction and observation, to piece together the clues with the murder, and the other killings that quickly follow suit.  All on board are suspects with many who have secrets they wish to keep hidden.  Can Hercule Poirot tighten the net and capture the killer before he/she strikes again?<br /><br />But of course he can, showing off the entire time, and taking readers for a confounding story of alibis and lies, coverups and misleading clues, that comes full circle in the end.  \\"Death on the Nile\\" is an extremely well-written mystery that will leave readers guessing until the very last pages when Poirot finally unveils his knowledge of the murderer.  It is by far one of Agatha Christie's greatest mysteries and a timeless classic example of what a good mystery should be.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I have been an AFI fan for quite awhile, and I will tell you, this album is good for all AFI fans. Sing the Sorrow was a step in a new direction. Decemberunderground is the same, but not nearly in the same direction at all. I for one feel that AFI gets better with every album they release. This slbum has a great meshing of generes, and is styliazed very well. Colorful, headbanging, and beautiful are words that come to mind. I feel that this album presents something that far supercedes the many other records that have come out recnently and will suprize you. If you are new to AFI this should be your first buy...trust me :) I would highly recomend this record. Something new for everyone.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The first season of lost was the test run.  In the second season, the makers <br />seem to know exactly where they're headed, and give it the storyline a <br />definate arc.  Although I won't spoil anything for anybody, I will mention <br />that there are new characters, settings, and mysteries (of course!) abound. <br />The mystery of the island takes some interesting turns with the discovery <br />of what is actually IN the hatch, and the season's finale (perhaps the best <br />Lost episode to date) is absoloutely mind blowing. Also making his debut, <br />is Henry Gale, a mysterious island stranger who our Losties suspect of being <br />an other.  He brings to the story what it was lacking in the first season: a  <br />VERY delicous bad guy.  His performance is award-worthy.  Finally, the <br />addition of a few other characters helps to balance some of the characters, <br />and give them more depth.

B000EULJLU|4.0|10,000 Days is twigging off the strong and forceful branch that is Lateralus.  There are similarities in tone and composition and the way certain songs seem to build, but differences in terms of lyrics and delivery.   <br /> <br />First off, Adam is still Adam, which is a great thing to be thankful for - meaning that you can always tell a TOOL riff from an imposter; however, he is once again overly repetitive and predictable.  Nevertheless, he introduces glimpses of the Adam of old with cool harmonics on a few of the songs, The Pot, namely. <br /> <br />Another thing many TOOL fans might be initially disappointed with is Maynard's overall vocal performance.  He is not as \\"in your face\\" as he has been on previous records.  This appears to be intentional, though.  After reading into his lyrics, which seem more straight-forward and exposed, it becomes obvious that he chose to sing each song to emphasize the meanings of each - and he somehow pulls it off nicely.  After a few listens, Maynard's effectiveness is undeniable. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a really good record from TOOL.  My expectations were very high before its release, and while it took me some time to truly enjoy all of it, I've realized it was time well-invested to give it a few uninterrupted listens.  The lyrics are very powerful, especially on Wings for Marie/10,000 Days, and I think any TOOL fan will enjoy this album after reading into the lyrics a bit more.  We can only hope this will satiate for the next few years, assuming TOOL will someday follow this up.
B000002UVX|5.0|There have been plenty of reviews here about the songs and musicians, but what gives me the goosebumps every time I hear it is Jimi's sound... It is the best live guitar sound I have ever heard, I can't even imagine what it was like in person. <br /> <br />Jimi was ahead of his time then and is ahead of our time now. How long will we have to wait for someone to fill his shoes?
B000FFJ85I|1.0|I found DecemberUnderground to be an extremely boring and generic CD release , with very few tracks that standout at all. Upon the first listen most of the songs appeared to run together , which really saddened me . I was highly interested to see what creative step AFI would take from Sing The Sorrow to this current album since the jump from The Art of Drowning to Sing the Sorrow proved to be quite interesting . I wasn't necessarily pleased with Sing the Sorrow either , but it really wasn't that bad at all compared to this , in fact , it's about 10,000 times better . I did enjoy the incorporation of stringed instruments and electronics into their music , but most of the tunes seem to fall flat or sound heavily uninspired . I'm thinking that most of the songs were probably B-Sides from the previous record that they re-recorded for this album . The only songs I can truly remember enjoying off this CD are the Intro , Miss Murder , and 37 MM (which features a rad Depeche Mode sort of feel) . You're better of saving your money and buying ANYTHING else by AFI...and I do mean ANYTHING , it doesn't even matter what . DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM FIRST IF YOU'RE A FIRST TIME AFI LISTENER.
B000EGF0QY|3.0|I bought this book because it is supposed to be really funny. I did find a few portions of the book humorous (although, it wasn't exactly sidesplitting laughter) I found myself a little disappointed. I thought the book was interesting because it kept my attention, and I can't really say it was dull, just not as spectacular as some of the reviewers have said. I do however, think that humor is very subjective, some people will love this book, and others will not be very impressed. It's going to come down to what tickles your funny bone, and unfortunately, this book didn't tickle mine.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I would be hard-pressed to say why this movie is as great as it really is, but maybe thats just because I'm an Inarticulate boob. Regardless thoguh, I feel compelled to add my voice to those that call this a great movie. I hate to beat an overplayed drum, but it really is funny and heartwarming. Do youself a favor and take a look at it.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|This is the most solid and diverse AFI CD, while it may not necessarily be better than Sing the Sorrow, Art of Drowning, or Black Sails, it is just as good just much different. Alot of people are giving 1 star because they dont like the style change. This CD has much more of an 80's pop feel to it than previous CDs, and other songs also have alot of screaming which hasnt been on AFI's songs much before. Overall the songs are all good, but my only problem with this CD is that maybe AFI has lost a little of their depth. Just listen to the song previews to see if you'll like the style or not... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie was made for the millions of fans out there that beleive that the game left them hanging.  <br /> <br />-To see it is to believe it <br />The animation is simply breathtaking. I must admit that there is a flaw with the character movement (Cloud sheathing his sword while riding his bike). The fight scenes are just oustanding. Some people might complain that it defies the laws of physics - this is an ANIME people, where anything beyond reality can happen. The character move pretty much flawlessly. Character design is beautiful they could have made Aerith prettier).the texture, facial expressions, background were done to perfection.  <br /> <br />-Story <br />I have to agree with some people, that you have to already know the game story to fully comprehend this movie(like I said before this movie was meant for the fans of the series and he game). For the \\"new\\" poeple, it still has a good story line. The plot of the story, as I see it is, the search to complete ones-self. Cloud - to be forgiven(peace of mind and heart), the villains - longing for a mothers love (the villains, no matter how powerful they are, are still children hence the title).  <br />Even I, a big fan of FFVII, did get a litttle confuse when I watched it the first time (Japanese release), but after a couple of more time I finally understood it. Note that the American release has been dumbed done, it's done everytime an anime is released here in the states (to the companies that do this - Americans are not dumb), to make it easier to understand. Between the Japanese and American release; the American release bluntly tells you whats going on on the other hand the Japanese release makes you think on what is exactly is going on (I prefer this). <br />The game left everyone hanging, the movie does a good job closing the Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa story line, well almost (watch the movie and don't forget to watch the all the credits aswell). Personally as a fan of Clerith(Cloud+Aerith), I would havepreferred a different ending, like near the end when Cloud got...... oops almost gave out a spoiler. Character development: must I repeat myself, already developed in the game, but the movie did a great job capturing these characters personalities.  <br /> <br />-Voice over <br />Japanese voices are much, much, much better than the english dub. <br />Where the heck do this people get voice actors, they are very monotone. Some english voice over were decent like Reno, Rufus, Tifa (a little too sweet, not enough toughness or confidence). <br />WATCH THE MOVIE WITH JAPANESE AUDIO. <br /> <br />-EXTRAS <br />The extras were pretty good. The interviews with the created team. Reminesence(flashback to the game storyline). Trailers of upcoming release. I wished they added more though; for example, the original 20 minute story line for the movie and the animated short that was released with the Japanese version (this short film would have added more to the story line for people who are not Final Fantsy fans). <br /> <br />-MUSIC <br />As always Nubuo Uematsu has done an outstanding job combining new compositions with the classic game music. Rock, piano, orchestra. <br />The timing of the music was perfect, what else can you expect from one of the worlds top composers. <br /> <br />-OVERALL <br />For fans of the series and game, you won't be disappointed. <br />For casual fans or new viewers, you might get a confused at first but you will get eventually understand and love or atleast like this movie. IF YOU DON'T MIND READING SUBTITLES, TRY TO GET A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE RELEASE INSTEAD OF THE DUMBED DOWN, POORLY DUBBED AMERICAN RELEASE. IF YOU CAN'T, JUST WATCH THE US RELEASE IN JAPANESE AUDIO AND ENGLISH SUBTITLES.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|This CD is split into 2 clear styles, mellow alt-rock that we have heard from these guys recently like their stuff from Californiacation, and then there is like straight up rock-funk like songs \\"Give it Away\\" and \\"Suck My Kiss.\\" <br /> <br />The funk songs just arent for me, they are over the top and embaressing to listen to. However the mellow rockers on this CD are all amazing songs. Overall I like about 14 our of the 28 songs, which still is alot, I basically just like the alternative rock songs and one funkish song (Tell Me Baby). The great songs are: <br /> <br />Dani California <br />Snow (Hey Oh)    &lt;----- Amazing guitar and verse <br />Stadium Arcadium &lt;----- reminds me of the song Californiacation <br />Slow Cheetah <br />Strip My Mind <br />Especially in Michigan <br />Wet Sand  &lt;----- the end of this song is AMAZING <br />Desecration Smile <br />Tell me Baby <br />Hard to Concentrate <br />21st Century <br />She Looks to Me <br />Make you Feel Better  &lt;------- gets me in a good good every time <br />Death of a Martian
B00063F8B2|4.0|the music on this cd is absolutly beautiful. it is great to listen to even when it is not Christams.<br /><br />so why the 4 instead of 5 stars?<br /><br />well, i really wanted this cd for the music in the scenes in the movie where the hero skies down the engine and jumps before going into the cave and the heartponding, edge of your seat scene on the iced over lake.  a version of the music is on here but it is not the actual music.<br /><br />it is still good and my children love listening to it in the car, so still worth the money.
B00082IJ08|4.0|After a recent re-view of the original 'Dawn of the Dead' by George Romero, this album has taken on an entirely new depth for me. Initially, it's a slick and intriguing listen, but it becomes more of an audio landscape once I realized that it's tied into the story of the movie. To wit: the first track, 'Intro', is a sample of the music that occurs in one of the more ominous scenes in the movie (done by the Goblins and Italian horror master Dario Argento). Consequently, all the rest of the tracks seem colored by that reference, and seem to tell a tale of desperate violence, apocalyptic horror, terrifying loneliness, bonds forged through shared catastrophe, and all the other motifs found not only in zombie movies, but the contemporary news.
B00006IRJU|4.0|Iva Davies is a genius!Crazy is awesome, Nothin too serious is just one of those geniune Aussie rockers that has nothin to do with anything but a good time,Electric Blue is just pure pop escapism at it's best. Need a time line? See Aussie Crawl,Cold Chisel,INXS etc. But for pure enjoyment after 15 years? Put Iva Davies on and turn it up <br />
B000001FS3|1.0|Just the fact that this mess of a CD exists and people bought it shows the power Satan(or whatever name for evil you prefer) is running rampant in the world.  I once wrote a song called \\"Dave Evans Must Die\\" because the music here is so boring.
1932907009|5.0|Blake Snyder has accomplished the rare task of making it not only thoroughly enjoyable to read about structure, genre and commercial considerations, but has also injected this peculiar book segment with a much needed and sought-after dose of realism, practicality and experience. Here is a hands-on guide to writing solid, commercially viable screenplays.  <br /> <br />If your shelves are bending, as are mine, under the weight of \\"how-to\\" books on every conceivable aspect of screenwriting, and your mind is blocked with conflicting concepts and approaches from all sorts of self-proclaimed writing teachers who share nothing but the conviction that they've got it all figured out even though they lack any credits of sold or even produced scripts - - - well, here's a refreshing change from all of this.  <br /> <br />Snyder has sold numerous pitches and scripts to Disney and other big-name studios, and saw some of them actually make it to the screen. This alone sets him apart from 90% of those 'experts' out there.  <br /> <br />Granted, you may have to tweak your arthouse ideas to follow Snyders approach; but you might actually end up writing a script to professional quality. And you can always save that episodic multi-national ensemble piece playing in a Coca farmer's Peruvian mountain hut with internet access for later, when your name is hot on the market. <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I love the albumn, and I am impressed by the Chili Peppers ability to improve with every new albumn.  This is more of a technical issue.  <br /> <br />My only complaint is that CD2 will not load onto my computer.  CD1 works fine, my computer can read it and upload it to either Windows Media or into Itunes.  But for some reason, CD2 cannot be read by my computer.  I have exchanged the albumn twice, thinking it must be some kind of glitch for one cd to work, but not the other.  But not one of the CD2 I've gotten has been able to be read by my computer.   <br /> <br />So if it is your intent to load this albumn onto your Itunes, I suggest buying it from the Itunes music store, and then burning 2 cds for the car or cd player.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Just picked up my copy today and loved it immediately.  I have been an Emmylou listener since the mid 70's - she's awesome. I also have have a lot of Dire Straits C.D.'s.    <br />Well the two playing together just turned out sweet !! <br />I saw them perform on the Don Imus show and knew they had recorded a winner. <br />Too many excellent tracks to list my favorite.
0399230033|5.0|This book is so adorable and just plain fun. My son likes the sound affects you can make with it, his favorite page is when the wife realizes how many others are visiting in her room that evening with her reaction being as such that it has happened before! This also gives you the opportunity to use your imagination with your little one, as well as him or her telling you what they think the story is!
B000F6IOC0|5.0|and not just because Kate is totally HOT!<br /><br />it's a cohesive story from start to finish.<br /><br />i think true die hart fans will definitely get<br /><br />a kick from this second film.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|Imagine a world where you can see and hear your family suffering, and there is nothing you can do to make them feel better.  Not exactly the standard definition of heaven, but that's how the afterlife is portrayed in Alice Sebold's novel The Lovely Bones.  Susie Salmon, a curious and spunky fourteen year old girl, is brutally raped and murdered in the opening chapter of the book, which immediately grabs the readers' attention.  Susie then relocates to heaven, which is described by Sebold when Susie notes that \\"we had been given, in heaven, our simplest dreams.\\" (18)  Also, Susie was allowed to watch people on earth, but not to interact with them.  She observes her family's struggles and successes, and watches with disgust as her murderer manages to avoid getting caught.  The complex plot in this book compensated for the superfluous and lengthy passages of speculation. <br /> Do not let the simplistic writing style of this book fool you.  If readers are easily offended by graphic or explicit scenes, this book is not for you.  From the violent rape and murder, to descriptions of sex, and the portrayal of a sick serial rapist, this book is no stroll through the park.  As Susie watches her family, her voice in the novel matures and grows, just as if she were still living.  Readers gather a unique sense about heaven: the ability of the deceased to have whatever they want, to observe those whom they left behind, and to \\"grow up\\" despite being dead.   <br /> Although short, this book is far from an easy read.  It is written clearly and concisely, but still proves to be though-provoking and emotional.  This book is recommended to anyone who enjoys thinking about heaven and does not mind long passages of speculation by the narrator.   <br />
0743243153|5.0|I am writing this review a little late, I read it 10 years ago. At that time I was an insecure, married, stay at home mother of three. After reading The Road Less Traveled, I knew that I could alter the path my life was going. I had become so despondant with my lack of education and feelings of inadequecy that I had become moderately depressed. Dr. Peck changed my life. After reading this book I now knew that I could 'change my map' and by doing so would one day see the light at the end of the tunnel. The first day of walking up the hill to my first college classes seemed like the neverending road, but I made it. I graduated Summa Cum Laude and am now a teacher. My marriage and family are happier because I am happy with who I am. This book changed my life. Dr. Peck's other books have all been worthwhile for me to read, but this first book empacted me like none ever has. My gratitude to you Dr. Peck.
1594830827|2.0|David Baldacci's newest so-called thriller is not much better than his first.  I got into the plot at first, but the story kept jumping all over the place and I was wondering if he was ever going to return to the characters he introduced in the prologue (he finally did, but not until about halfway through the book). <br /> <br />Eventually the story became more and more implausible, bordering on unbelievable, and I only kept listening to the audiobook because I wanted to see how it would end.  I needn't have bothered; the climax is really more of an anticlimax, and while Baldacci builds up the character of the heavy (Tom Hemingway) to a point where you expect him to reveal that he's a super-villain, he doesn't really get anything to do.  There's no climactic fight between Hemingway and the heroes of the story; what conflict there is is extremely disappointing. <br /> <br />Finally, the guy who narrated this audiobook apparently doesn't know the first thing about how to do it.  He needs to listen to some professionals (like the people who do Recorded Books) read a book before his bosses let him back in front of a microphone.
B00000JPYD|5.0|One of the all time great releases brought up-to-date with an excellent remaster.  Probably every white-bread teenager alive in the 70's knows this record.  There isn't a stinker track on it.  Trower's guitar is at once dreamy and commanding, Dewar's voice is powerful and soulful, Isadore's drum is everything it needs to be, no more and no less.  There are several bonus live tracks (in front of what appears to be a live studio audience for a radio show).  The band is very tight indeed and very audience friendly.<br /><br />Go ahead and buy, the remaster is worth it and you get several bonus tracks to boot!<br /><br />PS:  Rest In Peace Jimmy Dewar, and thanks for all the great vocals.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I finally just got this ... and let me tell you, as a long-term Floyd fan (since the 70's - my teen years; See my Floyd list \\"Floyd Side of the Moon\\") ... this is pure Gilmour.  He has a very unique vision of his music and it really shines through everywhere on this great new release (Early, mid, late floyd, prior solos - trippy, spacey, dreamy, but solid - it's all here!).  That \\"heard this before\\" feeling is understandable, HE's THE ORIGINAL.  Beautifully harmonious/melodic in many spots and prolific with variety ... the guitar slide work alone makes this recording soar - I've felt the power in a holy place (This Heaven)!<br /><br />Always one of the most influential guitarists/musicians and one of my top favorites all of these years, I felt very satisfied after the first listen and ended up listening to it all day, over and over (and played along on guitar - wonderful to jam with).  In the mid-70's, lovers of Meddle, Obscured by Clouds, Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, etc. could tune in with MELLOW rock, you know, the trippy stuff that flowed between the two headphone speakers and carried you to a better space.<br /><br />Thank you David, Richard and all of the great contributors on here for this knock-out music fest.  All of these years working, living, loving, enjoying life since his last ones have obviously brought him joy and inspiration, and for that we get to enjoy this.  It grows on you with every listen, as all good albums do, and has very few weak spots for me.  For those of you who think this is weak overall, I would suggest adjusting your musical antennae, your wires may be crossed.<br /><br />Very nice packaging is provided including all lyrics and excellent track notes (in an odd, but cool bound book style - and a rubber disk that holds the cd, don't lose it).  In my parallel universe a few of these songs, as singles, would be #1 hits: Smile SHINES (if they would ever give it a chance I'm sure it will be huge ... one of the prettiest songs I have ever heard); On An Island is an Earthly Heaven (the near-perfect harmony with Crosby & Nash really adds to the song); This Heaven is catchy as hell!  Take A Deep Breath and you get a whiff of Animals ... seems like a plodding mule at first instead of Sheep, but sometimes it takes old reliable to approach radio friendlness.  It does build into a pretty nice jam and rounds out the album with a tad of aggression.<br /><br />Others are meditation rock, probably not for mass consumption (thankfully): Then I Close My Eyes is like mother's lullaby as is a Pocketful Of Stones; The Blue slays you with it's great slow build-up and guitar-lead, high flying crescendo; A Red Sky At Night is like classic Floyd in it's dreamy state; Castellorizon and Where We Start, begin and end the album in classic form ... Dreamers may leave but they're here everafter (On An Island).  The production dynamics are intricate and the sound quality sparkles.  They all rock and do their jobs taking you to the island David had in mind.  The work that went into this recording is admirable.<br /><br />So, ... break the bread and pour the wine (and lift a glass to the band)... MELLOW OUT On An Island (MAYBE THIS, through our mutual human love of music, could put us on course to end all war and hatred on this ISLAND Earth ... WE ALL LOVE MUSIC, THEREFORE WE ARE ALL CONNECTED IN AT LEAST THAT WAY ... every person around the world from every culture who loves Floyd and looks forward to an event like this, feel that thread and connect to the collective [un]conscious.  In that place, only what is good for us all is pursued with love, respect and understanding.  There's something to build on; may another human being never again set out to do grave harm to another, what ugliness the world has endured, we are meant for a higher purpose than to hate, I'm sick of it - STOP WAR! PEACE ___In honor of Syd).<br /><br />No, those aren't birds on the cover halfway to the stars, but angels --- and our energy source, the Sunreflecting between the Moon and tide!  Ebb and flow, Let it GROW (On An Island)!nd flow, Let it GROW (On An Island)!
048623231X|4.0|I have looked at a variety of Dante artists. Some well known and some are not. Suloni Robertson, John Flaxman, Willam Blake, Sandro Botticelli, Sandow Birk, Herb Roe. Do a google search to look at the works of some of these like Sandow Birk. There are some that are more obscure which in a way documents the Comedy, more specifically the Inferno. I'm not going to say who I don't like but Dore is the best. I am rather specific about artists. Dore makes the grade. He is good, really good and when you look at this book, you feel like you are in the terrible depths of hell. I like purgatorio too. I feel the religious prayer songs in my head as I see Beatrice's entrance. There is so much symbolism in these pictures, especially in Paradiso. Though I do disagree with the depiction of Muhammad in hell, the rest is fantastic. I mean that he looks more like he's British then Middle Eastern. I imagine him with blonde hair in the plate. The tortured look on Dante's face in the plate with Betrand de Born, (The cover pic) is extraordinary. I felt how he felt. That is why Dore is so good. I had also hoped for more detail with Ugolino because his story is fantastically horrifying.  <br /> <br />The book is a must for any Dante fan. I look at it a lot, even if I have seen the pictures hundreds of times. I really don't think that you can get bored with this. There is always something new to look at. Some detail you looked over. Buy this book because the scans online don't give the justice that this book has. Buy it, look it over, get inspired by it. Maybe we will see your work on Amazon in the near future.
B00005A0N5|5.0|Nightwish's style of power metal and speed metal with symphonic tones, synths, and operatic singing blends perfectly into this album! This is my favorite Nightwish album, and I think it is probably their best work! Tarja Turunen's voice can be really dreamy, operatic (duh) and has got that fantasy-like vocal as well - I can see this thing be put into the power metal genre with symphonic arrangements. Nightwish has really got me turned on into extreme symphonic styles of metal! check these guys out!
B000002I25|5.0|No studio album hit it bigger with rock fans then the Doors self titled rock debut, which produced two radio classics and introduced a new, original rock band to grace the 60s and early 70s era.  For the most part, \\"The Doors\\" reveals the group establishing their high energy, pyschadelic, unique sound to the public in outstanding fashion.<br /><br />The album opens with a rock classic \\"Break On Through\\", which sees Krieger moving the track along with the killer riff and Morrison belting out the vocal.  \\"Soul Kitchen\\" shows Manzarek shining on the organ, mixing perfectly with the poetic lyricism of Morrison.  The \\"Crystal Ship\\" is a sweet ballad, with Morrison delivering a fine baritone.  \\"Alabama Song\\" is classic bar music, with Manzarek's trademark organ sound carrying the core of the track.  \\"Light My Fire\\" is arguably the biggest hit in the Doors repetoire, written by Krieger who has a killer solo halfway through.  Manzarek's organ has the catchy melody and Morrison nails the vocals.  \\"Backdoor Man\\" is a fantastic, heavy blues number originally composed by Willie Dixon.  Morrison goes wild in this one.  \\"I Looked at You\\" is softer, more melodic tune performed in good taste.  \\"Take It As It Comes\\"  reveals a  brighter side to the Doors, with a cheerful mood throughout and a beautiful organ solo.  However, the closing song \\"The End\\" is an all out 11 minute rock improvisation, formed through previous gigs, and Morrison's creative narrative is backed by powerful percussion from John Densmore.<br /><br />Overall, this album changed the face of rock n' roll, and gave the public a greater taste of psychadelic rock, with the Doors uniquely familiar instrumentation.  The band went on to produce an even more psychadelic album with their sophomore.  This classic is the one that started it all and is recommended along with all their other studio albums.
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|In V for Vendetta, a masked hero attacks the institutions and leaders of state that rules with fear, torture, incarceration, and propaganda and inspires the masses to rise up and overthrow this morally bankrupt government. <br /> <br />But--then what? <br /> <br />Was V fighting for a better government? <br /> <br />Or NO government? <br /> <br />While the movie seems to leave V's politics at \\"Freedom!

The V movie ads say \\"People shouldn't be afraid of their governments.  Governments should be afraid of their people.\\"  To the V of the graphic novel, government shouldn't just be afraid of the people... <br /> <br />...it should be ELIMINATED by the people.
B00003CXIP|2.0|This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about \\"..never getting out of this small town.\\"?   <br />I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie.
1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon's debut novel, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time,\\" is a breezy read starting the main protagonist, Christopher John Francis Boone, the autistic narrator who stumbles upon Wellington, the impaled dead poodle of neighbor Mrs. Shears during the opening chapter 2 (All chapter numbers are prime numbers, thus the reason why the last chapter number turns out to be a high 233). Boone has a knack for numbers and math, but people and the environment are chaotic to him, overwhelming in fact. <br /> <br />Haddon draws you in immediately as we read Boone deciding to solve the who-killed-the-dog mystery in the vein of his favorite mystery detective, Sherlock Holmes. Literally being inside the thought-patterns of the autistic Boone is an effective tool in captivating the reader's attention and illuminating the often-darkened area of autism. Boone has many quirks: hates the colors yellow and brown, prefers not to look at people's faces or be touched and likes to solve math problems as a stress reliever. Boone is also quite literal, to the point of not understanding simple jokes. His brain, simply put, is wired differently. Yes, like Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of an autistic in \\"Rain Man,\\" you tell Boone a date and he can quickly tell you the day of the week. Or ask him, \\"What's 251 times 864?\\" <br /> <br />\\"And I thought about this and I said, '216,864.' Because it was a really easy sum because you just multiply 864 x 1,000, which is 864,000. Then you divide it by 4, which is 216,000, and that's 250 x 864. Then you just add another 864 onto it to get 251 x 864. And that's 216,864.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time's\\" magic is the novel lets you walk inside Boone's shoes. Instead of reading the dry proclamations of a DSM-IV to better understand autism, Haddon's novel fleshes out the often-impenetrable world of autistic individuals and allows reader to have some understanding, and more importantly, sympathy for those suffering with autism. <br /> <br />The reader learns about Boone's world as Boone is determined to solve the mystery of Wellington's killer, but the reader is also treated to deeper mysteries as Boone's curiosity pushes him to uncover more than he had wanted to allow in his precariously ordered world. But it is too late as the Pandora's Box (in this case, a shirt box that contained letters) has been opened and Boone can never erase the unleashed new knowledge. Haddon's writing is steady and believable throughout as the voice of Boone, an autistic teenager who struggles to navigate daily life that we often take for granted with our finely balanced brains that block much of what Boone cannot but help to see. \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" will keep you curious enough to read till the end, and perhaps even take a mental stab at the math appendix. <br /> <br />Bohdan Kot
0739302752|3.0|I was disappointed by this book. The content is very good, but the format makes it like listening to a textbook being read. It takes far too long to make simple points. Larry Bossidy's segments are excellent, but they are few and far between. Most of the book sounds like it was written by the academic Ram Charan. Jack Welch's book Winning addresses many of the same points in a much more engaging manner & the audio is read by Mr. Welch himself. My recommendation is to read Winning.
B000FGGE68|5.0|This film was great...<br /><br />It wasn't like a major high budget film or anything, but the plot was nice... a little dissapointed with the role of the \\"child\\" which was not in the trailers..<br /><br />But it was pretty ok, Milla Jovovich was amazing as well...
B000FILW86|5.0|What a great album!  So many standout tracks.  \\"Welcome to the World\\" is so rocking that you almost don't realize its about a baby being born. And \\"O Claire\\" is the best Beatles song since anything by Fountains of Wayne.  As other reviewers have mentioned this is definitely Cheap Trick doing what it does best: quality rock songs with enough hooks to catch a great white shark.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|If you look at AFI from the first 7\\" to Sing the Sorrow you can't honestly say they have been releasing the same style of music for 15 years.  The initial work was very straightforward CA punk and the later albums, especially Sing the Sorrow, have taken a more orignal voice and added elements from hardcore, pop, gothmetalstuff, and the music era we all love to hate - the 80's.  But c'mon, they are one of the hardest working bands in music today and this album is a testament to a very creative, orginal, and talented band.  Does it sound like the music they were putting out when I was still in high school? NO.  Is it good anyway. YES. <br /> <br />Also, for all of the people so shocked at the \\"screaming\\" on this album...have you listenend to their best record Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes?  Davey wrote the book on melodic screaming.
B00009MGGI|5.0|All three of the titles in this series are excellent.  The second in the series, To Play the King, is my personal favorite, showing equal sides of the coin; evil, corruption and greed vs. caring, benevolence and giving.  Absolutely worth watching, more than once.
B000FILW86|5.0|Believe it when you're reading that this is the best Cheap Trick in a long time. I keep going back and wondering is \\"Rockford\\" better an this album, or that album..?  The answer is YES; it really IS. I'll put this album as a B+ effort. It's better than Standing, Doctor, Lap, Busted, Monster (horrible), 97' (fair at best), Special One (very unspecial), and Hangovers (soncially gave me a hangover). That takes me back to Next Position and All Shook up time frame. And yes, Rockford has it's place nudged right there along the early 80's efforts.  <br /> <br />Do NOT confuse this album with anything pre-shook... cause it ISN'T. Nothing is and ever will be. BUT, this is the best we've heard in 20 years.  <br /> <br />Robin's voice is still best in the business hands down. He's the best rock singer of all time, and this album cements it for me. I'm blown away he can still sing as well as he does in the Cheap Trick style. This music is more melodic than we've heard from the guys in 20 years, and you'll swear it was like popping in All Shook up or One on One. It's GREAT. <br /> <br />The one dissapointed I have is that if Cheap Trick would use a top-notch producer to create a better in your face sonic pop, it would push this album to an A+ without a doubt. Not since Busted have they really focused on sonic quality. \\"Dream the Night Away\\"  is basically \\"All We Need Is A Dream\\" 20 years later... and you true fans know what I'm saying. Unfortunately, I NEED MORE RICK on this album. RICK, come out, come out wherever you are... and you'll see what I'm saying when you put this on. <br /> <br />33 years later, they're still doing it; cranking out great music and touring. They are simply, and always will be THE BUSINESS of rock and roll.  <br /> <br />On a 10 scale, Rockford gets a 9.0 <br />Find a producer who can make this album a spiritual experience through your stero speakers, and this is a 9.5 or higher. That's a fact-  Go buy it
0060930349|4.0|Paul Johnson's History of the American People is a great response to Howard Zinn's work. Johnson's offers a conservative take on much of the events and people that Zinn criticizes harshly. The book is a fairly optimistic work, speaking to the resilience and ingenuity of the American people.  I particularly enjoyed reading his unique takes on the value of the Nixon and Coolidge presidency and his criticisms of JFK. Paul Johnson has an interesting perspective on American history, as he did not learn about as a child growing up in England.  He appproaches American history with a certain zeal not found in other historian's works. I really enjoyed reading the book after reading Zinn's work.
B00006GA4C|5.0|I finally got this album last summer and was more than pleased to see that it was available and not out-of-print.  I've tried since 2000 to get it and now I got it.  Mark Farner's voice and guitar playing couldn't be better, Don Brewer's soulful voice and drumming just keeps the music rock hard, and last but not least, Mel Schacher's groovin' basslines with the other 2 lay down the BluesyBallsyRockin' standard.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Very hilarious but disgusting in the same time :P  Anna Faris is great at acting and she can really change her whole reality character!      About the movie, if you are in the mood of laughing then what r u waiting for?! Just watch it and have fun!
B000E6ESL2|4.0|Don't watch this trippy, eerie little film for its dud of an ending  - a cliched homage to Ambrose Bierce (with the Brooklyn Bridge subbing for Owl Creek).  Watch it for the unbelievable, mind-bending visuals.  Watch it once for the solid performances by Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts and a heartbreaking Ryan Gosling.  Watch it again, ignoring the lead actors, and just look at the background.  Pay attention to the multitude of identical twin/triplet extras, study the environments/settings, the lighting and wardrobe, listen to all the repeated phrases and whispered voices, note the omnipresent patterns (specifically a grid motif), the recurring pieces of art, the clever transitions from scene to scene, and the supporting actors who each play multiple small roles.  Marvel at how director Marc Foster masterfully breaks all the rules of filmmaking (e.g., \\"crossing the line\\" with the camera, characters conversing shown in separate shots both facing the same direction) to create a dreamlike mood of surreal unbalance.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film despite the disappointing ending.  It has a dark, ominous mood and, visually, is stunning.  And I can watch it over and over again, each time seeing something new.
B000EWBKM6|1.0|I don't know why anybody would want to buy the series finale of Will & Grace.  As an avid viewer, I was disappointed to say the least.  It seemed as though the writers of the final episode had never seen the show before.  I thought it was a horrible way to end a great show.
B00005JM02|5.0|Fantastic movie.  Unbelievable animation.  Great character development. <br /> <br />Anyone who finds fault with this should submit some of their work and/or accomplishments for the rest of us to review.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Only System could pull off a cheesy R&B-sounding hook like the one on B.Y.O.B.  System seems to use it to add some scarcastic humor to the point they are trying to get across.  This is a classic song on a classic album.  The album will remain strong because it deals with issues relating to today's society. <br /> <br />The second cut, Revenga, is an example of how far System has come mucically.  Harmony, operatic, hard-hitting lyrics gives this song almost a Queen-like feel.  It is far heavier and more complex than any Queen song, however. This is my favorite jam on the album. <br />   <br />Cigaro is a fast, hard-hitting gem that showcases more of System's odd sense of humor.   <br /> <br />Radio/Video deals with comedy in a lighter sense.  System show their versatility here.  This song helps with the flow of the album. <br /> <br />This Cocaine is a song only System can do.  Truly unique and outrageous. <br /> <br />Violent Pornography has relevant social commentary and kind of comes across as a heavier version of a Green Day song.  While Green Day is great, this song proves how much more powerful and progressive System is.   <br /> <br />Question!  is another System original that transcends the barriers of modern rock music.  If you havent heard this one, you must check it out. <br /> <br />Sad Statue has another chorus urging listeners to wake up and realize what is going on.  This song is a roller-coaster ride. <br /> <br />Old School Hollywood contains some more light-hearted comedy, with an electronic feel.  This song is almost like a NIN song with a heavier yet more humourous edge.  <br /> <br />Lost in Hollywood is a classic ballad that is something new for System.  This song showcases the guitarist singing, much like Lonely Day on Hypnotize.  This proves that System can create awesome melodies with the best bands out there, and it creates a memorable close to the first half of Mezmerize/Hypnotize. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed Hypnotize (the second half) better, Mezmerize is  just as edgy and just as classic.   <br /> <br />If you have not seen this band live, check them out.  They are the best out there right now.
0786890932|5.0|I loved this book!  The way it depicted Holly's life after losing Gerry is amazing.  The author did a wonderful job of incorporating happy and sad moments, things that really happen in real life.  I fell in love with the characters and I was instantly hooked when I started reading.  If a book doesn't catch me within the first 5 pages, I put it down.  This book was so good that before I knew it I had read 50 pages.  I definite must read!!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Somebody wrote that they are Bush-hating...He totally missed the point.   <br />System of a Down looks beyond our country and takes on a worldly view-point.  They lyrics make you realize the nature of today's world. They aren't taking sides, they are just reporting from the viewpoint of an uncompromizing, socially aware human entity. After-all, we are all humans first. <br /> <br />System has the social awareness of bands like the Clash and the Sex Pistols; the humor of the Dead Kennedys, Frank Zappa and Primus; and the powerful sounds of Rage Against the Machine and Black Sabbath. While System has all these elements, they have an attitude and character all their own. <br /> <br />On Hypnotize, they have harmony and melody like I have never heard in heavy, fast music.  Every song provides a unique listening experience.  You can tell that they have truly created ART.  They shift styles, tempos, and moods like only System can.  Most songs on this one are memorable.  Viscinity of Obscenity is hilarious, raucous System.  Hypnotize is emotional, operatic System.  Dreaming, however is the standout track for me.   <br /> <br />I have not heard better, more progressive music in the past few years (Toxicity through Mesmerize/Hypnotize) than the ART from System of a Down. <br /> <br />Hypnotize alone should go down as an all-time rock and roll classic.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I believe that ALL fans of the original Broadway play will love this movie. They may not like it better, but they should love it! It's emotions are so powerful, so tense, you can feel it. It's a ROCK musical that has every word ringing in your ear with lots of meaning. Not many musicals move their story along with music like this one does. You really need to pay attention to the lyrics here.    If you're a fan but haven't seen this movie yet, you should. Tracie Thoms (Joanne) and Rosario Dawson (Mimi) fill the shoes of Fredi Walker and Daphne Rubin-Vega PERFECTLY. All the other 6 people ARE FROM THE ORIGNAL CAST!     Here are some of the reasons why I think the movie version of Rent works out a little better than the broadway play:    A more logical plot: In the original cast play, half of it takes place on Christmas, at least from 9:00 P.M. on December 24 to perhaps early in the morning on December 25th. That would mean everything from the song \\"Rent\\" to \\"La Vie Bohème B\\" took place during a period of only a few hours. It's almost impossible. But here, half of everything takes place from 9 pm December 24th to when everybody in the restaurant is singing \\"La Vie Bohème B\\" late at night on December 26th.     I also like how much fat has been trimmed from the original Broadway play. \\"Rent\\" was originally a rock opera. Much of what was sung in the original play is now spoken dialouge in the movie, with almost the exact same words too. We now have that, and the major songs. Perfect!    What I also like is how the movie starts out with \\"Seasons of Love.\\" This song is now sung by the 8 stars only (not to mention, along with the rest of all the music, has much more clearer vocals, and layered, more full instrumentation). It's perfect because it basically introduces what the play is about. \\"Seasons of Love B\\" keeps its original spot, except it comes before Maureen's and Joanne's \\"Take Me Or Leave Me.\\" \\"Seasons of Love\\" is supposed to be feel good, and the movie does a perfect job of it.     I recommend this movie to both fans and non-fans of Rent, and fans and non-fans of musicals/operas. Rent basically turned me into an addict of itself and made me a fan of musicals. I often thought of most musicals as things for kids but not after Rent.     Please see this eye-opening, heart-racing, goosebump forming, and tear-jerking movie! You won't regret it.
B000002BQK|5.0|This Album is an r&b classic. every track on this album is outstanding and Mariah it seems almost effortlessly delivers every single song with top-notch vocals(like she always does). I honstly cannot find one flaw on this entire album. This is Mariah at her Vocal and Commercial Best. The Best songs are \\"Honey\\", \\"Breakdown\\"(my favorite cut on the album), \\"Fourth of July\\", and \\"Butterfly\\" however every song is incredible.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|I would love to be able to say that I like this album, but I can't.  I'm doing my best to be very open minded about this album, and I just keep getting stuck thinking about their old stuff.  I can't say that this album is bad, but to me it's just not AFI.  I understand that bands grow and mature and I actually enjoyed their last album, but this one falls way short.  There is absolutly nothing punk about it.  The only thing close is Miss Murder, which sounds like it was stolen from GreenDay.  There isn't anything chaotic or aggresive about this cd, it's all very techno/emo, if that even exsists.  My biggest complaint isn't that the band has changed, it's that this album is completely studio.  This cd is filled with manufactured, over produced sounds, instead of instruments.  The tone is interesting and I think it will be very successful, unfortanatly it sounds like it was made with the purpose of being as mainstream as possible.  The \\"Sorrow\\" that has become AFI seems fake, I don't feel any real emotion from listening to this album.  I am afraid that if this wasn't AFI, I might like it a little more, but this cd has no soul, it's shallow and boring.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The Emancipation oF Mimi is yet another outstanding offering from the always consistant Mariah Carey. That is why it upsets me so much when people and the media call this her \\"comeback\\" album. Comeback from what? she never went anywhere. if u check your records Charmbracelet(the album that came before the Emancipation of Mimi) sold a respectable 1.1 million copies. And despite the personal issues she was dealing with, heavy media criticism and little backing from Virgin records, Glitter Still Managed to sell 1 million Copies. All 8 of Mariah's other studio LP'S have gone platinum or better. So please explain to me where the comeback is. The only explianation i can come up with for people and media alike calling this a comeback is that they are finally opening their ears to the beautiful voice of Mariah Carey. So on that note i say keep the classics comin Mariah because it seems like finally everyone is listening.    Mariah's album sales (tell me where the comeback is)  US Album Sales:    Mariah Carey- 9 million; #1 for 11 consecutive weeks.  Emotions- 4 million; peaked at #4.  Music Box- 10 million; #1 for 8 weeks.  Merry Christmas- 5 million; peaked at #3.  Daydream- 10 million; #1 for 6 weeks.  Butterfly- 5 million; #1 for 1 week.  Rainbow- 3 million; peaked at #2.  Glitter- 1 million; peaked at #7.  Charmbracelet- 1 million; peaked at #3  The Emancipation of Mimi- 6 million; peaked at #1  I'll let y'all do the math!
B00008OLYN|5.0|I own every Opeth album, and \\"Damnation\\", oddly enough, easily stands as my favorite.  It is absolutely loaded with phenomenal melodies, tones, and lyrics.  If there was ever going to be a \\"soft metal\\" album, this is exactly what I would want it to be.  It perfectly creates an atmosphere that IS Opeth.  It's dark, dramatic, and emotional.  There's some wicked guitar work throughout the whole album. As I mentioned before, the tones they've managed to create are perfect for the mood of this album.  If it weren't such a lame thing to do, I would absolutely try to rip off the sound of this album for my own band, and stick with it forever.  I would fail anyways because I don't think anyone that isn't Mikael Akerfeldt can create masterpieces like this.
0375507256|5.0|Put me in the camp of those who found this novel brilliant and exciting. I enjoyed the first third enough, but later ... when Mitchell's themes started to come into focus ... I became completely and utterly hooked. It's one of the best novels I've read in years.  <br /> <br />I find anything 'post-modern' to be cold and sterile, and had avoided reading this because I had heard that it was both post-modern and difficult. Neither were true. The language was playful, the structure relatively straight-forward, and the characters had a rare warmth and depth.  <br /> <br />I can see how the middle passage, Sloosha's Crossing, would be difficult for some. The dialect is based on the rural 'pidgen' spoken in Hawai`i. I never thought I'd see it in a work from the UK! It's hard enough to understand if you're not from the islands; I can't imagine how someone who has never heard it would understand Mitchell's version of post-apocalyptic pidgen.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I don't understand why people always complain when a band like AFI decides to take a new direction.  I am personally grateful that AFI is a band who changes their image and sound with every record.  If Art of Drowning sounded like Answer that and Stay Fashionable, I would have given up on the band years ago. <br />I catch some hints of industrial style in it.  I'm not gonna lie...I love it.  It's refreshing to hear an older band come out with ever-changing, evolving music.
0345479092|5.0|This book was given to me as a gift. When I first glanced through it, I really didn't think it was for me. Then one night my 4 week old son spent a good 2 hours screaming. I looked through the \\"What to Expect\\" book and a \\"Living through the First Year\\" book and finally, I picked this book up and found a chart on a baby's cries. My husband and I were able to quickly figure out that our son was backed up with good old fashioned gas! She had all sorts of advice on how to relieve him. After that I read the book cover to cover - I used the E.A.S.Y. method and things went smoothly!!! He is now 14 months and still has a great routine! He thrives and always knows what's coming at naptimes,mealtimes and bedtime. This book offers solid advice rooted in common sense. What more could a new mom need?
B00005JOWR|4.0|This is a wag-the-dog satire, with a sly humor that is not put into films these days.  The narration is used with percision when describing the horrid position the protagonist, Nick Naylor, occupies lobbying for virtually all tobacco industries.  The one-liners between people like the MOD squad, Merchants of Death, comprising of Nick himself, the lobbyist for firearms, and the lobbyist for alcohol, made me giggle like a little school girl.  The only thing that keeps this movie from getting five stars is that it seemed to end abruptly.  I wanted more!
B000062YAZ|5.0|This 1986 album is thrash back when metal was still metal, and no trend had overtaken it. Unlike all them nu-metal bands or hardcore/punk bands who pretend to be metal or good metal, Slayer is the real deal. They ain't no mall-punk variety metal band for kids. I'll leave the big sell-out arena shows for Fall Out Boy or whoever. If you like old-school thrash, check out DISCIPLES OF POWER on iTunes. They have 5 CDs: Power Trap (89), Ominous Prophecy (91), Invincible Enemy (93), Mechanikill (96), In Dust We Trust (06). And they were done during the time thrash was still going strong, and ten survived all the trends; grunge, rap, techno, nu-country, \\"hardcore\\", nu-metal etc. I doubt many of those bands will be remembered 20 years later, or still doing it unlike Disciples Of Power. So, support old school thrash from Canada, sample before you buy, check out info at MySpac,com/DisciplesOfPower and you can't even d/l this stuff off P2P apps! And to buy the 5 OOP DOP CDs in stores is difficult or would be expensive.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|Hello, I have recently purchased 'Decemberunderground'. I have to say I am disapointed, but also am starting to like the cd. One of the reviews I have read say that \\"once you get past the inatial shock its not that bad...\\", And I soppose their right.  That does not exclude the fact that I am dissapointed. I have been an A.F.I. fan since i was about 11 or 12...(thats 9 years for you all), and I have to say I am a pritty big fan. I have purchased all of their CD's and records. I don't know if any of you are familiar with the ghost/bat/anglic figure on the inside of \\"the art of drowning\\", but I have painted a 7x6 foot mural of that. I have to say I am mainly disapointed about the popularity it grew. In highschool I would get made fun of for the way I dressed (punk) and the music is listened (ska, punk, A.F.I.) to and now the kind of people that where making fun of me, are now listening to them. The popularity they grew is overwhelming. Every cd A.F.I. seems to change, but since \\"sing the sorrow\\" it seems when ever they come out with a new cd now, everone buys it, it losses populatity and then they throw it away after a month. As apposed to the people who would buy it and listen to it until the next cd cameout. But enought of that, on to the cd. I think it is a good enough CD for A.F.I. but it should have taken less then a year. With this, and sing the sorrow, I expected it to be their best yet, concidering the fact that it used to take them 1 year at the most to make a new fanominal cd. I think its good and just listening to all of the tracks after the 3rd one (miss murder) that its alright. I didnt like \\"love like winter\\" much, but that was about it. I guess they changed...mabe not for the better. But all of us fan who like the older stuff better can keep listening to that and eventually move up. How many of us can honastly say that if A.F.I. didnt change we'd still be listening to them from their first vinyl? A.F.I. is always changing, for better for fore worse
B000002H97|3.0|Being a Metallica fan since '86, I can see why fans thought this was a sellout. Compared to the first 4 lps, this one pales. But is not nearly as bad as ANY of their later ones. That's why this 'black' album doesnt seem so bad today. A band can change sound. They have the right. But whether comparing this CD to old Metallica or comparing new Metallica to other contemporary bands both are not as good.  <br />If you want to hear some real metal, check out Canada's DISCIPLES OF POWER on iTunes. 5 CDs: Power Trap, Ominous Prophecy, Invincible Enemy, Mechanikill, In Dust We Trust. This what Metallica should've remained doing. See info/bio at MySpace,com/DisciplesOfPower and preview this 'What If' story had Metallica not changed their sound. iTunes is free download and easy to install for PC & Mac. And of course, both Disciples Of Power and Metallica both opened for the same bands in Canada back then; Razor, Sacrifice, Kreator etc.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|Just because a band changes their sound does not make them a sell out. To me it'd be boring as hell if every album AFI made or any band made for the matter sounded the same.  <br />Sure this album is different than any of their other stuff, no one will argue that but why not welcome change? <br />The songs are poppier sounding but if you read the lyrics they're still pretty dark and depressing lyrics.  the band likes industrial/electronic music so i'm not suprised that you can hear that in this album.  <br />I love the album overall. My only problem is that the lyrics seem more simplistic/not as poetic as other songs of theirs but it's definitely enjoyable. Open your mind and think of it as something new instead of comparing it to their past album.
B000EZ913I|4.0|(Note: this is more of a review of this specific reissue than a review of the album \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers.\\" Needless to say, the album is fantastic...but those just looking to grab the record should look for the stock Legacy reissue. This Mobile Fidelity mono hybrid SACD is made for a specific crowd, as is this review) <br /> <br />I have to say that I haven't been spectacularly captivated by \\"new-phase\\" Mobile Fidelity. I did, however, make a pledge that if MoFi suddenly started releasing stuff that was interesting--stuff otherwise unavailable on CD, for example, which is how I saw them remaining relevant in the current music market--I would eagerly bite. <br /> <br />Well, with the mono Byrds discs, they have delivered something interesting, and as I'm a man of my informally-expressed internet word, I picked up this hybrid SACD of \\"Notorious.\\" So how is this second entry in Mobile Fidelity's foray into the world of the Byrds? <br /> <br />Packaging: Okay. Not quite premium, which is disappointing given how expensive these things are. MoFi increased the size of their usual postage-stamp covers, but c'mon...do we still really need that design? The booklet seems to be a variation on the booklet included in the standard Sony package, only slightly blurrier, with little \\"mono\\" annotations and the mastering credits replaced. <br /> <br />The blurb on the shrink wrap is also interesting, as it implies that these mono mixes are from 1969 (aka a year after the album's release). Huh? <br /> <br />That said, MoFi's packaging has never been amazing, so perhaps this is an unfair area of criticism... <br /> <br />The sound: Excellent, for what it is: a great transfer of a somewhat muddy mix from a sort of shaky source, this nonetheless represents a really nice variation of this album on CD. For those who are wondering, this DOES seem to be an alternate mono mix. The differences are pretty subtle, though; some I've noticed thus far are less-pronounced horns on \\"ArtificialEnergy\\" (on \\"Till I'll be up in the sky\\"...the tape for this song, by the way, is pretty chewed), and a more-pronounced vocal effect on \\"Change Is Now\\" (which STILL has a slight fade-up). Edits and segues are also a bit different. <br /> <br />The stereo bonus tracks are NOT new transfers, but are derived (at least partly) from the transfers used to prepare the Sony reissue. This is unsurprising, and as these should be properly viewed as \\"extra content\\"--i.e. stuff that Sony likely mandated be included--I don't see this as a big problem. <br /> <br />Verdict? It's nice to see MoFi embark on a more esoteric path, but the super-premium price for a product that...isn't really super premium (re. artwork, etc.) still rankles. It's also unfortunate that \\"Brothers\\" isn't one of the more fascinating alternate mono mixes in the Byrds pantheon, but that isn't MoFi's fault. That said, if you can get a discount that pushes this into a more reasonably priced category, it's a great curio that hopefully signals the release of more similar, niche items in the future. Mono Dylan, perhaps?
B000000OQF|1.0|Like Poison and Cinderella, Guns N' Roses took hair metal by storm with their 1987 debut, which featured metal riffs alongside Aerosmith-style boogie. Their caterwauling lead shrieker Axel was many, many an American teenage white boy's wet dream: a rocker who could b---- about women, blacks, gays and immigrants with impunity. Better yet, even 'liberal' minded critics ate it up, giving Axel kudos for giving honest voice to the social dislocation felt by white male suburbia. Interestingly, the very things Axel and his legions were railing against were what the contemporaneous Reagan administration were battling: civil and gender rights. (GNR, of course, was not with the conservatives on the sagacity of the sexual revolution.)    Prior to GNR, the punk aesthetic had challenged the dissaffection involved in shrinking economies and the failure of sixities optimism. After GNR, Nirvana and the \\"Riot-Grrl\\" movement faced new economic problems and a deepening of apathy. GNR themselves, however, revelled in the culturally divisive consequences of these problems. They celebrated anger like the punks did, but without the punks' sense of irony. \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" brought out the worst inclinations of the hair-metal crowd, and whites across the world cheered.
0385338694|5.0|Although Sophie Kinsella's protagonists often exasperate me, I found Samantha to be a much more likable and realistic character compared to Becky of the Shopaholic series. I certainly related to her feelings of getting out of the fast-paced rat race of her high powered career in the big city and finding happiness in a simpler life that allows for rewarding downtime. This story had more substance than the Shopaholic books too, as Samantha clears her name and restores her professional reputation, and then must face the dilemma of returning to her old life as expected of her, or following her heart. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the authors style of writing, especially the dialogue, is as funny and enjoyable as always, and makes the book move along smoothly with lots of laughing out loud!

I feel that I've always known what he shares, but without recognizing it.  A light bulb pops on in my head, and it is that \\"Ah hah!\\" moment that oh so subtly makes a gigantic difference in the way you see and what you do.  Above and beyond happiness or sorrow, there is joy in this utter peace that does not come and go, but is always there.  And how great that months and months after \\"A New Earth\\" was published, Amazon users are still reading it and reviewing it.  I'm guesing that, like myself, a lot of people recieved this book as a holiday gift, and WHAT a gift!  If only our leaders could sat down and be taught what it contains.<br /><br />Thanks, Eckhart!  I have no idea how a human being acquired such miraculous wisdom, but I am eternally grateful that you recieved it and give it.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|AFI's music doesn't have to be \\"hardcore\\" in order to be good.  In fact, the further AFI drifts from their East Bay Hardcore roots, the better their songs get.  \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" was a great example of this.  But \\"December Underground\\" takes it to the next level.  It's pretty obvious a lot of time and effort was put into each of these songs, and the attention to detail paid off.  The poppy nature of this release doesn't turn me off in the slightest. Why would it?  I guess if you're a fan of hook-less, forgettable music, you might be disappointed with \\"December Underground.\\"  But if you're a fan of hooks and a fan of getting songs stuck in your head for days, you'll love it. <br /> <br />I commend AFI for their desire to change with every release.  If they continue to put so much craftsmanship into their music, they will likely never let me down, no matter what artistic direction they take. <br /> <br />Oh, and their trademark lyrical content is completely intact.
6305882592|5.0|I had put off watching this movie for SO long because I was disturbed by the idea of such an old person forming a loving relationship with such a young person. Wow, that prejudice blinded me against such a great movie. I finally watched it and was amazed. I laughed, cried, and really enjoyed the characters and emotions coming through the screen. Harold has a cool dark humor and although suicide isnt funny this movie really pulls out laughs. Maude is so sweet and you can really get into the personalities of these people.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is a cult classic, because to me that means it only speaks to a certain group of people at a certain time period. The themes and ideas are relatable by all people at any time, even decades later. I think this is a wonderful movie well worth anyone's time. It certainly warmed my heart, and I like to think made me more open to not judging a movie by the cover.<br /><br />Plus the soundtrack is totally awesome!!!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I didn't feel a need to review this movie because there are plenty of positive reviews. From the reviews (all 900 of them) it is apparent that you either love this movie or hate it. There is a lot of gushing by the 5-star-ers. The negative reviewers say it's boring and bizarre. I think both camps are missing the point. I grew up in rural Utah, which is similar to rural Wyoming. I relate to the poverty of life and poverty of feeling. Rural guys in this area really do act like those in the movies. They mumble and don't talk much. The interaction between two guys who aren't well acquainted is often mostly just avoidance. The initial sex scene was very believable. These guys really needed an excuse to show their feelings. The alcohol and freezing cold broke down their inhibitions. They crumbled suddenly like a fortress built on sand. The pacing of the story fits the rural pace of life. They were so oppressed by their upbringing and environment that their infrequent trysts in the wilds was actually very brave. That they finally let circumstances crush them is very depressing. This really is a sad movie without a lot of joy. But that often is how life is. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Well, first, I must identify myself as a Colin Firth/BBC version fan. That is the best adaptation of P&P. For a two hour version though this version can grab readers and non-readers alike. It is well done in terms of scenery and casting. It also has the necessary butterfly-in-the-stomach moments that make it a good romance whether or not you have read the book.<br /><br />I did however, not need to see the last scene after they are already married. I thought it was the definite sign of a Hollywood movie trying to be everything to everyone. I didn't need it and I am a huge romance movie fan. After such a beautiful walk in the fog, the last scene seemed too out of place and cheesy/embarrassing.<br /><br />Another complaint is that people who have not read the book might be confused by some people's relationships or personalities because there simply isn't enough time to flush all this out. Bottom line, true P&P fans will notice some glaring issues, but everyone can find something in this movie that is worth the watch. I had to own it, as a companion for the ultimate BBC version (please watch it if you like this movie).
B000FFJ85I|4.0|Weither your an A.F.I fan or not im sure alot of people will injoy this CD. However there are certain flaws that i would like to point out. First off it seems the old A.F.I has finally kicked the bucket. I cant really seem to play \\"Total Immortal\\" and then \\"Miss Murder (Miss Misery)\\" and view it as the same band. But, like every band,they evolve and grow to accomidate the tastes of what kids and teens enjoy. So, beacuse the industry is full of emo scremo bands and such (i.e My Chemical Romance, Hawthorne Hieghts) A.F.I is simply going with the flow to (of course) make more money. the only sad par about this album is that it seeme to be filled with techno, stuido made sounds. Once again its all in opinion of what you like. Personally i dont mind the new generation stuff beacuse its becoming really all there is to buy in music stores. However whats funny is that they seem to have tried to bring in there old style of dress but falied miseribly. So all in all it certainly has its pros with the techno and rock but its just not the old stuff that we all grew up with. It suddenly changed form hard rock in \\"Total Immortal\\" to a techno-rock song of \\"Miss Murder\\". But ,once again, thats just me.....
B000FFJ85I|4.0|After hearing \\"Miss Murder\\" on the radio, which I thought was quite catchy and entertaining, I thought all the vocals on this CD were all going to be as different as they are in that song.  However, after listening to the entire CD, I have felt that they have made a great CD that meshes their previously more punk based style (as in \\"Very Proud of Ya\\") with their newer emo-like style (as in \\"Sing the Sorrow\\").  I would have to say the most interesting thing on this CD is the addition of some techno sounds and interludes, which were not present in their earlier CD's.  After listening to their rendition of a NIN song on their MySpace page, I can hear where their techno/industrial inspiration is coming from. <br /> <br />After reading some of these reviews, I can't believe that people who like AFI don't like this CD.  If you like \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" or \\"The Art of Drowning\\", you're almost guaranteed to like this one.  \\"Miss Murder\\" is the definite radio song of the CD...
B000059Z8J|1.0|Was this released as a joke? Despite being called the special edition this is the cut one. Theres a lot of missing scenes. The deleted scenes section only includes 2 extra and I can think of at least 4 other missing scenes not included in this dvd. <br /> <br />I guess my definition of Special edition must be different to everyone else's. <br /> <br />Very disappointed with it.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|When I first heard Miss Murder, I really excited about this album coming out. I mean Miss Murder was a different for AFI, but I thought Decemberunderground was going to take off from Sing the sorrow. However, I was greatly disappointed when I first listened to Decemberunderground. Overall, the album is too slow and too \\"poppy\\" for me. Musically and lyrically it is good, but it just isn't my type of music anymore. There is also a little too much techno. I am a fan of their old stuff, but I realize that is natural for a band to change. \\"Miss murder\\", \\"kill caustic\\", and \\"affliction\\" are probably my favorite from this album. Maybe if I listen to it a little more, it will grow on me. A lot of people will like this album and I will support AFI, because I am a big fan, but this just isn't my type of music.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|What a difference 45 minutes of extra footage makes! <br /> <br />As a fan of the great historical epics such as \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"Gladiator\\", I had high hopes for this film when it was released in the theaters.  Like most people, I was disappointed with that version, which felt rushed, incoherent and whose characters lacked depth.   <br /> <br />Thank goodness we now have Director's Cut DVDs.  This film is so vastly improved by the added material that it is difficult to believe I was watching the same movie.  Balian, Sibylla, and Godfrey particularly benefit from this version as we learn more of their histories and the events that motivate them.   <br /> <br />Almost miraculously, Orlando Bloom's acting seems improved in this version.   Some of his speeches (\\"Rise a Knight!\\") remain cause for a roll of the eyes, but in this version he seemed to be much more acceptable.   <br /> <br />If Russell Crowe had been cast as Balian and the Director's cut of the film released in theaters, there is no doubt it would have been a Best Picture nominee. <br />
0716703440|4.0|I bought this book because I briefly scanned through it in a library.  Wheeler and Thorne have both written terrific books on general relativity so bought the book because I have had a retirement project of learning general relativity and quantum mechanics at a level considerably above the usual popularization; but Gravitation went a bit too far for me.  I had to drop back and pick up some more introductory texts in order to go to chapter 2.  I still intend to work through the book and it is one of the standard graduate school texts so I rate it highly -- with the qualification that you need to be pretty motivated or have a good Physics background to use it.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|I personally loved AFI more than anything else out there,  <br />just the lyrics, and mystical style they had going on. <br />Once they went to Dreamworks, sing the sorrow was a huge change. <br />I eventually accepted change, it afterall was still them, with Davey Havok tearin' up the vocals. Decemberunderground really is pretty dang good, It just disapoints me... Don't get the wrong idea, but if you are a hardcore/true AFI fan like those of us with them since the beggining you may also be dissapointed. It sounds NOTHING like any AFI put out before, and the lyrics I must say are a bit weak compared to \\"Black sails\\" or even \\"Very proud of ya\\" for that matter. Though I would have blamed sing the sorrows change on Dreamworks... Partly the singing lessons they gave to Davey (Which totally destroyed his unique style) but hey... But it is clear now they are not the same band (at all) that they once were, all you can do is embrace the change...  <br />I am pleased with the 1st half of the album, I am not going to say they rushed (by any means) to meet the 06.06.06 release date, it just seems like once you get a little further in songs like \\"Kiss and Control\\" or \\"The Killing Lights\\" sound like any other pop rock (im not gunna say punk, because that is not what this is) band.  <br />Just compare for yourself... Listen to any of the following songs: <br />[The 1st two are from Nitro records] <br />-\\"Narrative Of Soul Against Soul\\" <br />-\\"The Despair Factor\\" <br />-\\"Miss Murder\\" <br />... All great songs, but you will definantly notice a transition. <br />Infact all you have to do is look at any of the guitar tabs or lyrics...  <br /> <br />Hope all that helped...
B00000HZFP|5.0|This CD is right up there with \\"Purple Rain\\". It's just ____ing good, G_dd___ it! What more do I have to say? Buy this CD.

B000002UWP|5.0|If you have never been introduced to Roxette this album is from when they were in their hey day and sold over 10 million copies so its gotta be worth a look.  <br />The great thing about this album is practically every song on it could be a single. In fact I sometimes wonder why some of the other songs aren't.  <br />Joyride is classic bubblegum powerpop with that trademark whistle and the wonderful balloons. Great hooklines. <br />Hotblooded is an overlooked single - it really rocks, and has a kind of blues souly feel to it. Harmonica is awesome.  <br />Fading Like A Flower - another single, slow at first launching into great powerpop <br />Knocking On Ervery Door - This is a cool song swith a funky beat. Could make you dance. Cool lyrics. Could have been a single too.  <br />Spending My Time - Beautifully melancholic, great vocals, bittwersweet, a good remix of this can be found on the Rarities album by the way.  <br />I Remember You - Quite a rocky number, but also blues soul influences too.  <br />Watercolours in the Rain - Marie wrote this song and from listening to it it really is a pity she hasn't written more. This is one of my all time favourites. It has a beautiful feel to it. One of their best ballads ever. Should have been a single. <br />The Big L - Rocky power pop. The video is quite porno i have to say.  <br />Soul Deep - Soul deep exactly. Originally on Pearls of Passion their first album, re-released for international market.  <br />Do you get Excited - another beautiful song. Ballad. <br />Church of your Heart - Another favourite. This song has great guitar on it and Per is great on it. It grew on me this one.  <br />Small Talk - Souly number <br />Physical Fascination - This is a really funky song. Bowie-ish in some respects. Its kinda different. <br />Things Will Never Be the Same - Awesome Powerpop with a flamencoish feel to it in some places.  <br />Perfect Day - One of my all time favourites. I think this is also one of Marie's favourite to sing. It is apparently a very hard one to sing. It is a real beauty. Should have been a single. Great closer to the album.  <br />The song order is well arranged on the album to take you through a great journey.  <br />Enjoy
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I am a longtime fan of the Final Fantasy series.  As a kid, I played and beat the very first one they made and have kept track ever since.  It's hard to say exactly why these things fascinate me.  But they do.<br /><br />Of all the reasons I can think of it probably boils down to the fact that when they make these things, it's not just about making a buck on cheap entertainment.  Final Fantasy is something that grips you, both in the way that an excellent book can or a great movie sometimes does.  One, it makes you think and two, you interact with it.  The best ones of all are generally agreed to be: FF4, FF6, FF7, FF10 and the online epic, FF11.  Seven was a turning point in many ways, it was vastly different from the previous versions.  It was the first time they really made an effort to make it less like a game... and more like a truly interactive movie.  Seven changed the entire video game industry forever in the late 90's, just like how Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda changed everything in the 1980's.  One other thing worth mentioning is that FF7 was one of the first games to feature a Black Man (\\"African American\\") in one of the key starring hero roles.  This might have had an influence on the spectacular sales of Seven (featuring a cast with a wide variety of racial backgrounds as they team up to prevent a planet wide crisis).<br /><br />So, the question is, how does non-interactive Final Fantasy measure up?  In this case I can say, pretty darned good.  The CG animation is amazing, particularly in the textured surfaces, like the look they created to simulate woven fabric ... incredible.  The voice acting is a godsend for us American and UK folks - they got it as good to perfect as they possibly could.  They also include a much appreciated recap of Seven's story to bring us up to speed (complete with stirring orchestrated music - prepare for a literal trip down memory lane).  FYI the main antagonist is named Sephiroth he is Cloud's former leader who at the end of Seven tried to become some sort of false divinity (A \\"One-Winged Angel\\" suggesting his lack of some critical quality that only a real angel would possess).  Oh yeah and some clarification of the whole \\"mother\\" theme and why the bad guys constantly say it.  It is connected to the planet and the environmental crisis.  The planet is \\"mother earth\\" a life giving source of energy.  Jenova is the \\"mother\\" which the bad guys talk about (cells from a Jenova sample were grafted into Sephiroth and others DNA thus they call Jenova their mother) ... an alien lifeform that crashed into their planet in a huge meteor long ago.  Jenova thus rivals and tries to replace the planet as the \\"mother\\" figure.<br /><br />It's not a cinema classic (yet, it certainly could be a cult classic) but it is a very well thought out, visually stunning motion picture that anyone can watch and enjoy.  The action sequences have a touch of the \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" syndrome to them (i.e. they fly around a lot), but in a world where magic and materia are the norm, you don't really mind it.  Once again I would like to underscore that the CG graphic animation is mind blowing.  They also got certain characters down absolutely perfect - it was a joy to see old characters like Yuffie, Rufus and Reno still around!  So sit back, open those eyes and take in the final chapter of Seven.  Very much worth the price of admission!to become some sort of false divinity (A \\"One-Winged Angel\\" suggesting his lack of some critical quality that only a real angel would possess).

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|When I saw Kingdom of Heaven in the theater I tough it was a \\"Good\\" movie. After reading favorable reviews about the Director's Cut I bought it and, well... they were 100% right.<br /><br />Riddley Scott's version is a totally different and a much, much better movie that the one shown in the theater. It has the soul that the other lacked. We can see much more about Sybilla which helps us to understand many other things and the beginning of the movie (when Balian is still in his village) finally makes sense.<br /><br />If you liked Kingdom of Heaven you have to see the Director's Cut. Now you will LOVE it!

Their newest album, Rockford, falls into the former. There is not one weak song on here. From start to finish, this album will keep you hooked. if you are a fan of 70s Cheap Trick, but have not listened to their recent work, give this a shot.

Richard Schickel also says of Wayne's performance that it is as good as any in  the history of film.   <br /> <br />Obviously by the title of my review ...I agree...and its a great story...incredibly directed by John Ford ....the greatest of all directors and everything from the casting to cinematography is perfect.  <br /> <br />THE DVD set is also wonderful.. the movie LOOKS GREAT for any age much less a 50 year old print.  THe VIstaVision print  is stunning!  On disc 2 there is a wealth of goodies...the new featurette (around 30 minutes) is terrific as is the previously released feature on the film with marvelous commentary by Patrick Wayne ,  John  Milius and others...and to round  things out...several WB making  ofs...which were \\"teasers\\" of the day. <br /> <br />THE ONLY downer is the 1minute plus preview for JESSE JAMES ..starring Brad Pitt. As a lover of western's I'll probably catch it but the 1minute preview doesn't deserve the STICKER on the front of this package touting its inclusion...geez...to buy this 2 DVD set for THAT preview..well ..that's as stupid as saying John Wayne isn't a good actor! <br /> <br />ENJOY...there is plenty here to spend time with..OH ,  and Peter Bogdonavichs audio commentary on the  film is typically first rate!!!

B0006HC0I2|5.0|This film, made in 1954, is an ironic look at an ageing gangster ready to go into retirement, having pulled off one last heist - several bars of gold - which gets him into a life and death conflict with several younger hoods plotting to steal it from him. He is accompanied by a long-time partner, and director Becker makes much of the friendship between them as they talk of getting too old for the life of night clubbing and show girls. Gabin is wonderful in this role, rarely smiling, often a little bored, while maintaining an air of gravitas appropriate for a suave, well dressed man of considerable reputation among his peers.<br /><br />The film moves rather slowly as it sets up the situation while taking time to humanize the characters, but eventually there is excitement enough as a kidnapping leads to a dramatic car chase, automatic gunfire, and explosives. The script is tightly knit, taking place over a period of 36 hours, and the cinematography is impressive for the time, as so much was shot in the streets of night-time Paris or in the darkened countryside (actually the Riviera). A revealing \\"floor show\\" is also in stark contrast to the Production Code-regulated exposure of skin permitted in Hollywood films of the 1950s.<br /><br />As the interviews on this DVD reveal, only Gabin among its cast (including Lino Venturra and a very young Jeanne Moreau) was known to film audiences at the time, and Gabin had long since ceased being a bankable \\"star.\\" This film was a comeback role for him and it helped launch the careers of Venturra and Moreau. Altogether, this DVD re-release offers many pleasures for fans of film noir and landmarks of popular French cinema. The collection of interviews from various sources, including Lino Venturra and the film's composer, are especially informative.

B0000C9JFO|5.0|Something of a multilingual cross between \\"Friends\\" and BBC's \\"This Life,\\" this film is an entertaining portrayal of several young singles sharing a crowded flat in Barcelona. The central character (played by Romain Duris) finds himself liberated from his parochial horizons as a 20-something Frenchman destined for a corporate desk job, in a restrained romantic relationship with a girl (Audrey Tautou) as maddeningly clinging as his hippie mother. His experience causes him a kind of rebirth as a European, his best friend among the lot a lesbian who teaches him how to make love to a woman - another liberating experience that has him seducing the wife of a newly married man who has befriended him.<br /><br />At two hours, the film has enough time to explore the personalities and relationships of most of his flat mates, and the conflicts between them that arise are quickly resolved in an overall celebration of being young, reasonably intelligent, and unburdened by any serious responsibilities. Duris, playing a naïve young man, is fun to watch as his character emerges from the cocoon of delayed adolescence; quite a contrast from his intense, driven, noirish role in the subsequent \\"The Beat That My Heart Skipped.\\"
B00004RMCF|4.0|Since Clint has gone 'politically<br /><br />stupid' lately with his last five or<br /><br />seven lousy pics, it's time to watch<br /><br />the original best US male actor!

B000F6IOC0|4.0|I found this sequel a little more satisfying than the original movie, although it's hard to keep up with all the plot mechanisms.  Suffice to say, the movie is nonstop action, violence, CGI monsters and lots of fight scenes.  Kate Beckinsale brings an earthy feminism to her role as Selene, while Scott Speedman underplays his role as the hybrid lycan/vampire.  Tony Curran is a despicable villain and Sir Derek Jacobi brings an Ian McKellenish finesse to his role as the perpetrator of the lycan/vampire bloodline.  The effects are quite good and although the hyperkinetic cinematography and the frequent blue tint can be distracting, the movie is well done.  A third film is probably inevitable but if it's as good as this one, well done!!!

B00005JOVH|2.0|Having never seen either of the first two X-movies, I didn't really know what to expect when I ventured off to what I had hoped would be the one action spectacular in season full of medicore (reheated and rehashed) summer fare.  <br /> <br />Although I had enjoyed the very simply-executed cartoon series, I was never interested in either of the previous film adaptations. I suppose it seemed that some comic book/cartoons should remain a guilty pleasure and be spared the bloated silver screen treatment. (Besides, how good can a movie with Halle Berry playing anything besides Halle Berry really be? And in a white fright wig, no less.) <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I succombed to the lure of advertisement and the novelty of seeing Kelsey Grammer in blue fur. <br /> <br />Unfortuatnely, an indigo-hued \\"Frasier\\" was hardly worth the $8.50 I paid for the ticket. The story (\\"script? what script?\\") was unfocused and the dialogue was amateurish. The acting was so laughable that one might have a hard time imagining that this kind of scene-chewing would have even been acceptable on a daytime soap opera. Ian McKellen acquited himself, but with such a poorly-written script it was hard to fairly judge of what kind of performances the other poor lot stuck in this film might actually be capable. (Halle Berry? Yeah, that she was Halle Berry in a white wig is probably the kindest thing to say.) <br /> <br />Despite an estimated budget of $210 million dollars, the film looked cheap and sort of spare - sort of like a bad 80's TV movie. Sure, there were some interesting special effects - and the last 30 minutes were a great improvement over what had come before. However, no action sequence or intriguing visual was spectacular enough to make me forget how bored I was.  <br /> <br />(They even messed up the chance to exploit the winged mutant. What a fantasy to be able to fly - and we were only treated to two short sequences.) <br /> <br />I am afraid that I have been spoiled by the big fx films like the LOTR trilogy and the two Spiderman films. Those movies puilled me into worlds in which I could believe in hobbits bearing magic rings or that a geeky kid could climb walls and swing on webs shot from his hand. I never bought into the X-Men world - I was always conscious that this was a poorly-executed film.) <br /> <br />The best thing I can say about this movie is that it makes the otherwise sluggish \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" seem absolutely masterful. Heck, even the poorly-received \\"Ultraviolet\\" was better than this - it was at least fun. I doubt that the legions of fans will be diswayed by one man's review. However, for those on the edge, take my advice: rent - don't buy.

B000FFJ85I|4.0|\\"Decemberunderground\\" is a pretty easy lightning bolt for anyone who wants to claim that A.F.I. have sold out their roots in the hardcore scene.

Hell, if you are looking for something like \\"Black Sails\\" then you're going to have just sit back with \\"Black Sails\\", you know? <br />But hey, you know what, the reason I buy new records from bands I enjoy is so that they can progress and improve, try new things and try to find a new shape as a band. If you want a band to release the same record over and over again then there are plenty of Offspring records on sale for you. And A.F.I. continue on the evolution they started way back on \\"Black Sails\\" on \\"Decemberunderground\\", the bands follwup to their 2003 platinum major label debut \\"Sing the Sorrow\\". <br />\\"Decemberunderground\\" is a flawed record but a strong one all the same. For the most part the songs here are well written and melodic, with the chant along choruses that made up \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" in place, a little more electronic elements throughout, and a slightly cleaner production to wrap it all up in(I would like to put emphasis on the word slightly in that previous sentance.) <br />The hardcore influences that marked the bands early catalong are nearly all extinguished, replaced with tasteful ambient keyboards in places, some legitimate riffs in others and Davey Havok singing for the most part as oppossed to screaming. <br />\\"The Missing Frame\\" and \\"37mm\\" are obvious standouts on this record, adding interesting new songs in the A.F.I. catalog, not sounding forced or easy but rather melodic and inspired. The records closing power ballad \\"Endlessly, She Said\\" is a sad, mournful lament that's easily relatable and features some excellent guitar work by Jade Puget. The lead off single \\"Miss Murder\\" brings the glam vibe of the early seventies into the new millenium with an addictive stomp, and \\"The Interview\\" and \\"Summer Shudder\\" build on the \\"Sorrow\\" template rather then dully ripping them off. <br />But more filler pops up here then there was on \\"Sorrow\\", a strong record from beginning to finish. \\"Kill Caustic\\" is merely a retread of what A.F.I. have done before, and have done better, and \\"Affliction\\", though not bad, floats over the head without leaving any sort of great impact, while \\"Kiss and Control\\" comes way to close to screamo territory for comfort, at least for me. <br />The other problem with this record is an odd identity complex, sort of. A.F.I. don't seem to know if they want to be the Cure(who, even though the styles are drastically different, are an obvious point of reference for the band, and who achieved stadium success after refining a little) or merely play in the same field as their lame, lesser followers, most notably the abysmal My Chemical Romance. Though the record avoids it for the most part, A.F.I. are better then every whiny, junior high emo band currently taking up time on the cover of AP or on Fuse, but at times on \\"Decemberunderground\\" they seem to be more willing to play in their proverbial field as opposed to smothering these children and ushering them away. <br />But this is a personal observation that most people either won't notice, will shrug off or will questionably embrace. \\"Decemberunderground\\" is a good strong record, even if it falls a little short of greatness. But I'm sure if you have enjoyed the evolution of A.F.I., not just one time period or record, than you will enjoy this record also.

0312995423|3.0|I must say that I have enjoyed reading Dan Browns novels the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons but Digital Fortress must have been written on his off days because I must say that it wasn't his best work.  From the begining he starts off the book with a slow paced start which leaves the reader wanting to put the book down and go to sleep.  The charcters although some like the protagonist have unique characteristics the others are mondane and seem like the average character that you would see in all his novels.   <br /> <br />The main character Susan Fletcher is the usual brainy beautiful heroine who is head of the cryptology department and is called in unusually on a saturday morning by the commander of the NSA (National Security Agency). He breifs susan on the situation at hand where a former NSA agent Ensaie Tankedo has done what he had threatened to do before he left,  he created a code that the translator ( the machine that can break any code in under an hour) could not break and he had the pass key. He threatened if the NSA did not reveal the translator and what it did concerning reading e-mail which infringed on personal privacy then he would release the pass-key to the world so that the NSA would be sunk.  so Susan has to figure out where the pass-key is but what she soon finds out is that her love interest a linguistic professor has been sent to Spain to gather Tankedos stuff because it turns out he died.  This is a big deal because the NSA suspects foul play and they were warned that if Takkedo died he would give the pass-key away to an anonymous person to spread the unbreakable code.  So David goes to Spain and he doesn't know why he is there but when he gathers the things he notices that a ring is missing from tankedos fingure and he has a feeling it is important.  This ring turns out to be the pass key and as David searches for it he doesn't realize that a man who will take his life and anyone who has seen or knows about the pass key will be murdered.Back in the states Susan realizes that not only does she have to save the NSA but her love as well by solving the code herself before the passkey can be dispersed.   <br /> <br />Overall its a good plot but the villan in the novel is obvious and you know who it is towards the middle of the book.  It was also confusing because it switched from one story to the next and you got lost on where you were in the novel.  I would only recomend this novel to people who like to solve codes and computer nerds because anyone else wouldn't read through the whole book, it would put them to sleep.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Okay folks, here's the deal with me. I guess I'm what you could call a \\"new\\" AFI fan, meaning that I haven't been with them since the days of \\"Very Proud of Ya.\\" Truth be told, I didn't even know this great band existed until a few years ago when, yes I'm saying it, I heard \\"Girl's Not Grey\\" on our local rock station (WEDG, 103.3) and saw the accompanying video on MTV. A few short days later, I ran out and purchased \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" and loved every song on it (including the techno-peppered \\"Death of Seasons,\\" and I am hardly a techno fan).  <br /> <br />Longing for more AFI, I decided to start purchasing some of the earlier albums in their catalog. The next one I purchased was \\"The Art Of Drowning,\\" and when I first listened to it I thought \\"wow...this is a really different style from 'Sing The Sorrow'.\\" But I found it to be an amazing piece of musical art nonetheless; standout tracks for me including \\"Of Greetings and Goodbyes,\\" \\"Wester,\\" \\"Days Of The Phoenix,\\" \\"6 To 8,\\" and \\"Morningstar.\\" The next purchase I made was the much-heralded \\"Black Sails In The Sunset,\\" and again I was thoroughly impressed. Favorites of mine on that album include \\"Narrative of Soul Against Soul,\\" \\"God Called In Sick Today,\\" and \\"Malleus Malleficarum\\" (I probably spelled that last one wrong, but whatever...). Only three albums in, these guys were quickly becoming one of my all-time favorite bands. <br /> <br />With my purchase of the four-song \\"All Hallows E.P.,\\" that feeling was only strengthened. I had no idea that it was this band that originally wrote the classic tune that is \\"Totalimmortal.\\" Unfortunately, just about all of the credit for that went to the much lesser band known as The Offspring because they covered it on the soundtrack to \\"Me, Myself, and Irene.\\"  <br /> <br />Anyway, a friend of mine then did me a huge favor. He burned me copies of AFI's first four releases: \\"Very Proud of Ya,\\" \\"Answer That and Stay Fashionable,\\" \\"Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes,\\" and the \\"A Fire Inside EP.\\" My friend stated that these four releases represent a very different AFI than I had become accustomed to, and he was right. I'm going to say this straight up: \\"Very Proud of Ya\\" and \\"Answer That and Stay Fashionable\\" are albums that consist of 95% terrible songs. They sound exactly like the droves of other three-chord skate punk bands that were around at the time of their release, with no attempt to sound different at all. It has always been my opinion that these first couple albums sound mostly like early Offspring, and for those who are wondering that isn't a good thing. The other two were slightly forgiveable in that they featured a more unique sound, but only by a small stretch.  <br /> <br />Fast-forward to 2006, and AFI's newest release \\"decemberunderground.\\" It sounds very, very different from anything this band has done in the past, but you know what? Change is to be expected when it comes to a band's music. What, would you \\"hardcore\\" fans rather have them put out ten more albums that sound like \\"Answer That and Stay Fashionable?\\" I for one would not, and I am happy that they have not chosen that (boring) route. For those of you waiting to see them put out \\"Even Prouder of Ya\\" or \\"Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes Part Deux,\\" you're going to be waiting a long, long time. This is band that, thankfully, progresses and matures with each successive release. No longer is Davey Havok whining about mohawks, cereal, skateboarding, and jocks, but rather writing lyrics that, although rather deep and metaphorical, can be related to by just about anybody. And the music being played by the other members of the band? Well, let's just say that Mark (former guitarist) and Geoff (former bassist) aren't fit to shine Jade and Hunter's shoes or carry their luggage. <br /> <br />Anyway, my favorite songs on this album (so far) are \\"Prelude 12/21\\" (easily the best opener AFI have ever put on an album, despite being accused of having a \\"50 Cent\\" beat), single \\"MissMurder,\\" \\"Summer Shudder,\\" \\"Love Like Winter,\\" \\"The Killing Lights,\\" and \\"Endlessly, She Said.\\" I've only had the album for one day, and as such it is going to require more time for all of the songs to grow on me. To those of you who have accused AFI of selling out (which they haven't, but just for the sake of argument), with all due respect please take your heads out of your behinds. All they have done is grow and further refine their already excellent sound. Make no bones about it, I'm not too big on the increased use of techno/electronica on this album, but it definitely gives it a new atmosphere of sound.  <br /> <br />And no, AFI have not become \\"just another whiny MTV band.\\" That title will always be reserved for lesser bands such as Simple Plan and Dashboard Confesssional.
B00000IWVS|4.0|Argerich's playing is nothing short of miraculous. It's as if God's most precious gifts had been all bestowed upon her - she makes other pianists pale in comparison. This record is no exception, even though it's not Argerich at her best. At times her playing here is too straightforward, too agressive, yes, even too intimidating, and I don't know if she's really being faifhtul to Chopin's music. It sounds as if she's intent on shunning people away from playing the piano and effacing every other interpretation from the face of the earth. It just doesn't fit Chopin's music all that well, but it's still worth buying and listening to thousands of times.
B00005JKNC|5.0|We just love this movie. I especially love the part where Pete experiences as Luke( he lost his memorie and got mistaken for Luke) that wonderful love of a father and after he remembers who he is , he is confronted to tell his \\"father\\" on his death bed who he is but chooses to call him \\"dad\\".This is a movie about the triumph of relationship and love.
B000002VCU|5.0|I have to say that I feel this is the most consistent and  <br />enjoyable APP album from start to finish.  This is from back when the arrangement of an album and track sequencing meant a lot more than it does these days.  A further example to illustrate that would be the Led Zeppelin albums.  The way those albums were put together is phenomenal; it just isn't done like that any more.  Like another reviewer said, I think the Eye In The Sky album comes closest to this one, but not quite there.  Regardless, they made some great music back then and if you're thinking of checking this out for the first time, don't hesitate.
B000301YY8|4.0|I'm surprised that I haven't come across the comparison sooner. Most people think of the BeeGees later years in disco and forget their early years ~ \\"To Love Somebody,\\" \\"Words,\\" \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.\\" The songs came from deep places in the heart with a sound that expressed those deepest emotions. Thanks to Blunt, we can now hear those heart-thoughts in the 21st century.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Great cd!, AFI has grown as a band. It's mellower than their other releases. But the fire still burns bright in the emotions and energy put into this album.
B000FILW86|3.0|Wow, the reviews are all over the map, kind of like for Pink Floyd's \\"The Final Cut\\" from 1983 and The Killers' \\"Hot Fuss\\" CD from a couple years back. <br />Cheap Trick are one of the best bands around, and this CD is solid, but it doesn't have the same magic as their 1977-1982 output (Say what you want about the Jon Brandt years, but \\"Tonight It's You\\" and \\"She's Tight\\" were terrific singles!) The new songs are OK and the band, no doubt, will pour even more energy into the tracks when they're performed in a concert setting. But it's not \\"Dream Police,\\" or even the 1997 \\"Cheap Trick\\" album. It's odd that some people (even bassist Tom Petersson) think \\"Rockford\\" is better than the 1997 disc. To my ears, nothing on the new disc jumps out and grabs you like the 1997 song, \\"Say Goodbye,\\" which has the greatest C.T. solo ever in it (played by Robin!). <br /> <br />But \\"Rockford\\" is still solid - a B; I just wish they had gone for more of the dirty sound of the 1977 and 1997 \\"Cheap Trick\\" LPs. I do love Cheap Trick. And Rick is an awesome phone interview, if you ever get the pleasure ...
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce stepped out of Destiny's Child for \\"Dangerously in Love,\\" her solo debut. Artistically, it's solid and provides a glimpse into the type of singer she could develop into with a few years more experience under her belt. Saleswise, its massive success ensured the end of DC. So I have mixed emotions about the album. Nevertheless it's obvious that someone as talented and driven as Beyonce would eventually step out on her own, so Destiny was probably doomed whether I like it or not. Standout tracks here include the title song, the duet with Luther Vandross and \\"Be with You,\\" a slow R&B jam perfect for some candlelight cuddling on the couch with a glass of wine and a pretty lady. Here's hoping that B's next solo album, which I believe is scheduled to be released this fall, continues in this vein rather than the tripe of \\"Check on It,\\" her single for the Pink Panther film. Personally, I can't wait to see her in about 15-20 years because I believe Beyonce could develop into another classic soul singer like Aretha or Vanessa Williams given some more time. Of course, I'll also be waiting for the Destiny's Child reunion too!!
B000006TRV|5.0|Wow. This is my second Pink Floyd album and probably one of my favorite albums of all time. This,  according to most critics and \\"fans\\" (those who thought the band's last two cds suck from lack of Roger Waters), is their last great acheivement. I on the other hand dissagree, but that's for another review. I think this one of Floyd's best, no doubt, and probaly their best concept album too, but I'm not as far as to say that Pink Floyd = Roger Waters. Sure, he had basically wrote all the lyrics and most of the music for this album, heck, the story is basically about Roger's life but changed into fiction. But let's remember that Roger is only one member of the band; Gilmour does an excellent job on the guitar and pulls off some of the bands best solos here; Wright and Mason also do an excellent job on keys/synth and drums respectively. Antway, even though Waters is a well crafted muscician, he is definitely overated. Movin on. I love the work that the band poured into this album, it's just amazing. There is not one bad track here at all. Each song goes into the next with ease. Also, this cd along with their previous album Animals and the next one after this one, The Final Cut, are their darkest albums both lyrical and in mood. At least it has somewhat of an happy ending, I guess. Waters is definitely one the best story tellers in music. There was also two tracks that didn't make it to the album at the last minute. Can't remember their names but they are on Is Anybody Out There? The Wall Live disc if you want to check them out. This cd along with dark Side Of The Moon contains some of their biggest hits, such as Another Brick In the Wall Part two, Comfortably Numb, and Mother just to name a few. If you are just getting into Floyd or love progressive rock, then pick this one up. Trust me.
B000001ELR|4.0|Hands down, the coolest album cover in the history of rock and roll. <br /> <br />While the album cover is worth the price of admission alone,its contents ain't too bad either. And it couldn't have come at a better time as KISS' career was on the ropes. Eric Carr gives the band some heavy metal credibility with his pounding drum beats as does whoever is playing lead guitar (one guess - it's not Ace). Whether its Vinnie Vincent or Vinnie Barbarino, \\"Creatures\\" ensured another decade for the fab four, even if the grease paint was soon to come off. <br />The album also stands the test of time much better than most of KISS' back catalog. I can still pick up my copy of this and enjoy the title track, \\"War Machine\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Hell\\" as much as I did back in the 80s. That's not something I can say for \\"Asylum\\" or \\"Crazy Nights.\\" <br />This isn't the Bee Gees KISS of Dynasty or the Alice in Chains KISS of Carnival of Souls. This is how KISS was meant to be: lude, crude and in the mood. If older fans have worn out their album or tape, they should pick up a new copy of the CD. Newer fans should add this to their collection after aquiring \\"Destroyer\\" and \\"Alive I.\\"  <br />Remember, if it's too loud, you're too old!     <br />
B000FILW86|5.0|If you liked any of the early cheap trick releases then you will love this one. All of the songs are good and the vast majority are excellent. Same basic formula, catchy, driving, memorable songs, however, the songs are more varied and lean less towards \\"bubble gum\\" rock than their prior releases. The sound, while still power pop, is much more mature and consistent. Highly recommended.
B000CNFC76|4.0|The Greatest Game Ever Played tells the triumphant true story of amateur golfer Francis Quimet, who captured the imagination of America at the U.S. Open Championship during the early 1900's. <br /> <br />It's a well written, well acted, well made film.  And although there is very little to be found in the story that hasn't been done before, (poor son of immigrant makes good in sporting arena, rises above class obstacles, gets the girl) there is pleasure in seeing these plot points handled deftly.  The film is well paced and is indeed strong enough to withstand the fact that we know Francis will win the tournament in the end. <br /> <br />Bill Paxton is becoming one of my favorite directors in addition to being one of my favorite actors.  His presentation here is very stylistic and faithful to the time in which the story takes place.  The recurrent and surreal \\"gnat on the ball\\" effects might be used a few times too many, but I understand why Paxton utilized this technique.  It helps legendize the tale and gives it a bit of Paul Bunyan quality.  It also keeps the film from becoming too dry or period. <br /> <br />It's a fine film to watch as a family.  Parents and kids alike can enjoy this one together.  That is a rarity these days.  It certainly deserves its place among Disney's best non-animated family features.  I recommend it highly.
B0000024ZT|5.0|Bruce Springsteen was often called the new Bob Dylan during his early career, and Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ is the prime reason why. Those who called him the new Dylan pointed to Springsteen's imagery and stream-of-consciousness lyrics, which resembled Highway 61 Revisited-era tunes.     But Greetings is a whole different beast entirely. It certainly owes a debt to Dylan lyrically, but musically it's more expansive. It sure ain't Born to Run, but you can feel the fire growing, and there are some definite classics here: \\"Blinded by the Light,\\" (later covered poorly by Manfred Mann) \\"Growin' Up,\\" (my personal favorite) \\"Lost in the Flood,\\" and \\"Spirit in the Night\\" are all great, great songs from a hungry young talent. And the rest is awfully good, too. Springsteen is a bit more optimistic here; even when he gets downbeat, there is an overall excitement to the album that keeps it from being overly depressing.    Considering where Springsteen was headed, this is rather surprising. In fact, one could hardly guess that in less than a decade, he would release the barebones (but brilliant) Nebraska. It's an exciting, exhilirating album that could easily be ranked among the best debuts ever (including Led Zeppelin, Please Please Me, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and whatever else you have to throw at it). There's no doubt that Bruce would improve on the elements that make Greetings an undeniable success. Indeed, The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, released the following year, shows impressive lyrical and musical expansion. But there's something so youthful and breathtaking about this album that it remains a wholly unique gem in Springsteen's catalog, and as good an album as any to start listening to him.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I've read the book and seen the movie.  The book is much better. <br />As usual, Brad Pitt gives an exceptional performance as Edward Norton's make believe other half.  What starts out as a simple meeting on a plane, ends up as a full blown 'club' where the characters basically beat the hell out of each other.  After a while, you start seeing people popping up all over the city with bandages on them but it must all be kept a secret.  As the fighting dies down, the 'gang' start to dabble in more dangerous ventures.  All living in 'Tylers' house, they hang around making plans for their next plot.  This is an excellent movie and book.  Very entertaining and although the ending was a little disappointing to me (shooting one's head up the side works wonders), I still fully recommend it.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|The first Underworld movie was a modest box office hit but enough, apparently, to spawn a sequel that continues the war that rages between vampires and werewolves. Director Len Wiseman pillaged visuals from both The Matrix and The Crow movies in the first one and this time around borrows a bit from The Lord of the Rings films in Evolution's prologue. However, from that point on, he strikes out on his own with decent results as he manages to improve on the characters and story he created in the first film.<br /><br />You have to give Wiseman credit - stylistically Evolution is consistent with its predecessor. It helps that he had a hand in crafting the story (and the film's mythos) and directed both movies while also advancing the mythology that grounds everything. He also changes settings, taking us away from the gothic European cities and into the countryside with ancient castles.<br /><br />As with the first film, Wiseman doesn't skimp on the R rated violence and gore, refusing to pander to the more lucrative PG-13 crowd (who would've just rented/bought the R version on DVD). He has improved upon his first film with Evolution which has a slightly more urgent tone because more is at stake. His direction is more confident and he wisely doesn't try to drag things out, keeping the running time well under two hours. Wiseman also manages to top most of the action set pieces in the first Underworld film without overreaching himself, including a climatic fight scene that is truly satisfying. Although, I have no idea how he'll top this one if the powers that be ask him to make it a trilogy... perhaps a prequel?<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, production designer Patrick Tatopoulos, second unit director Brad Martin and editor Nicolas De Toth.

B000F3A7LE|5.0|I didn't know this, but there were two different versions of Exposure. The first CD release was significantly remixed from the album mix, and Daryl Hall added some new vocals (according to Robert Fripp's engaging and informative liner notes for this issue).     The excellent new two-disc edition gives the orignal album mix on one disc and on the second disc gives all the tracks from the CD-mix edition, plus some original Daryl Hall vocal versions from 1977/8 that were never released due to pressure from Hall's management and record company.    The remastering is great. Disc two (the mix I'd never heard) sounds superb and I'm sure disc one sounds just as good. The previous reviewer's criticism of the booklet/sleeve combo is correct, but you can slide the back page of the booklet into the right-side CD pocket for a decent solution.
1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon's hero Christopher is a triumph!  Locked in a world that few of us catch more than a glimpse of but many of us are aware of, he ventures out to make sense of a mystery.<br /><br />Along the way, Christopher confronts some of his demons and shows extraordinary courage in renegotiating the orderly control that is so important to him.  Christophers learns much as he makes his journey but not, I suspect, as much as we readers do.<br /><br />Whether this is an accurate portrayal of autism I cannot judge.  What I can relate to, though, is the isolation in a foreign world which is very much a part of life for many of us.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all who need to be aware of different realities.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B000F3AAUW|4.0|The songs are good on the CD.  They are different from everything else out there.  I don't think I would call this CD rap or hip-hop.  It's kinda like funk.  It its not hardcore rap or hip-hop.  So I don't know why this other person that would give it a zero is even rating the CD when they don't like rap or apparently has never heard the CD.  The CD sorta reminds me of the Gorillaz.  If you are tired of the same old thing you will like this cd.
0060005424|3.0|I loved \\"Sabriel.\\" Loved it.  Rushed out and bought the other two books in the series, but after finishing \\"Lirael\\" I can honestly say I don't know if I'll bother more than skimming the last book.<br /><br />The story of Lirael is wonderful.  Interesting, absorbing, with great world-building.  Sameth, however, is a drag. I wound up skimming his part of the narrative, because I found him boring, petulant, weak, and uninteresting.  My disconnect with the story-line in the Sameth parts further led to a growing impatience with the writing, which in the main is no more than adequate.  Perhaps I have too-high expectations of young-adult fantasy (but having read a great deal of it, I don't think that's it). The repetition became tedious.  We KNOW Sam is afraid of death and the necromancer Hedge. We KNOW he is afraid to venture into Death. We KNOW Lirael wants the Sight and wants to feel like a true Daughter of the Clayr.  The 750-thousandth time it's repeated?  Gets a bit old.  Shame on the editors for allowing the book to go on for 600 pages, when at least the second part of the story could have been cropped down to a faster pace by just leaving out all the repetative whining the two characters do, and most especially Sameth.<br /><br />And at the end, when suddenly everyone is telling Sam he's not a coward?  I threw the book across the room.  he spends the entire book being a coward, and then at the end, I'm supposed to believe he's a hero?  How stupid are young adults supposed to be, here?<br /><br />I'm still giving the book three stars because I did love the story of Lirael in the glacier, and I love the world that Nix built, though I'm disappointed here at his mediocre writing.  \\"Sabriel\\" sucked me in at the first two chapters and kept me there.  \\"Lirael\\" had me, and lost me when it departed from her story to cover the spoiled and weak Prince Sameth.<br /><br />Read the first book, but don't expect the second one to touch it.
6304602979|5.0|I rememebr seeing this when I was like 10 years old. I am still amazed I sat through a 2 hour movie at that age and now I can see why I did.  Action.<br /><br />Btu now after viewing this a second time, I am now convinced this is one of the greatest ever.  I have my problems with this movie like all others but they are so minor, it would be stupid to dwell on them.<br /><br />My friend told me to watch this becasue he claimed that slater's character is me, he was wrong.  Every character is me.  This should be an inspiration for anyone looking to write or even make movies one day.  The way EVERY character has something that we get to explore, even if it is just a tad, we still get a sense of who they are.  They don't just throw in a major character and not explain him.  Even Pitt's stoner character was pretty well explained.<br /><br />Basically I am doing too much rambling because it would easily be the longest review ever if I shared all my thoughts. But this is why you don't just give every movie 5 stars here, cause a flick like this comes along and you really have to think about all your past reviews.  No thinkin on this one, I am a kung fu movie fan, and I certainly got what I wanted.  Btw-you  people do know this is a fu movie, right? I didn't hear any hi-ya's, but they beautifully captured the spirit of a old school kung fu flick on this one.<br /><br />I will tell yuo what I was told 2 days ago by 3 other people, \\"you are an idiot if you watch any movie before this one\\", oh god were they right.<br /><br />Btw- I know I didn't talk abou the actual movie, that is because it is magnificent, and I can't allow myself to spoil a second for you.  All the other reviewers are dead on with their 5 stars, now click on the new and used section, there ya go...<br /><br />Also the version I am reviewing is the  widescreened one disc unrated version with no special features.  Good enough for me.<br /><br />-CAN'T BELIEVE I HAEV TO FREAKING EDIT THIS-<br /><br />To the reviewer above me, how the hell is this a 4 star movie.  You had better nto tell me that reservoir dogs, jackie brown, or pulp fiction are better than this.

B000FFJ85I|5.0|I am one of those AFI fans who loves everything they have ever put out. I perfer older material over all, but love it all. This album is very different than anything they have ever done and its still great. Its not as \\"bouncey\\" as \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" and dosent show nearly enough anger as any of their previous albums. But is still very beautiful. When you go in listening to this album, dont go in expecting a whole bunch of Punk, and dont go in expecting a whole bunch of Hardcore, just go in expecting 12 great songs, done by a great band.
020530902X|4.0|This book, together with a handful of others, has been part of my reference library for over 30 years.<br /><br />Why? Because it is easy to refer to and easy to understand.<br /><br />Communicating effectively is about both clarity of thought and effective use of language. Elements of Style can assist with both.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
0312995423|4.0|I have read all four of Dan Brown's books and enjoyed every single one of them, including Digital Fortress.  Let's keep in mind that this book along with his others is FICTION and should not be taken too seriously.  We all know this would not happen in reality; so instead of being so critical, why not enjoy an easy, fiction read?
B00000D9TQ|4.0|when I was in school Another day in paradise was the first song I had heard by Phil Collins. Phil Collins has a real soothing voice and his songs contain that melodious music that cant be heard much these days. I wish it would rain, Against all odds, Groovy kind of love, one more night are true gems in this album. Two songs are a missing and that is a huge disappointment. they are Everyday and DO you remember. That is all I have to say
B000FILW86|5.0|Cheap Trick has a LOT of die hard fans, and they all seem to meet on Amazon.  And all of these fans love the band for different reasons, and argue why the band either has excited them or let them down with each release, while other fans feel the opposite.  Sometimes the band is too hard, sometimes not hard enough, sometimes too raw, sometimes too polished. <br /> <br />This release should satisfy everyone into Cheap Trick, as well as attract new rock fans.  It takes from elements of every Cheap Trick album and blends them all together in a fresh new CD that sounds like a greatest hits in and of itself.  Heck, the tunes are so catchy, that when I read others list their favorite songs from the CD (and remember, being a diverse fan base, everyone's favorites are different), every single song immediately plays in my head.  After one listen. <br />In a world of 99 cent downloads, it's great to have a full album of quality rock from start to finish. <br /> <br />Dirty details: <br />-Robin's vocals are better than ever.  His absolute best record. <br />-Rick's guitars aren't loud enough.  Are they ever, though? <br />-Tom's tone and playing are AMAZING.  Better than All Shook Up. <br />-The album is LOUD.  And this is great.  EXCELLENT production.   <br /> <br />I'm incredibly thankful that Cheap Trick continue to put out new music, as bands younger than them are already permanently in retro-mode with no thoughts for new material.  There is not a single weak track here, and I'd love to hear the whole album played live.  I'll definitely buy the Japanese release too for the Mando Ragga bonus track.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|When I went to the theater to see this movie I really didn't expect seeing something like that!<br /><br />Of course, the receipe of the scary movie are here, all the more that this is a remake from the japanese-\\"dark water\\"-version. But thanks to his amazingly talented director (Walter Salles that is far from being specialised in the scary movie genre), the movie has a very human and emotional aspect.<br /><br />This is a story about love, about family and about loss.<br /><br />It is very intense at the end, and all the cast is very great (of course Jennifer Connelly first of all, but also the little girl playing Cecilia who is completely amazing on screen).<br /><br />So, trust me, this is not a typical horror movie and that's what is good with that one.<br /><br />So try it ;)
0385336691|5.0|There are NO better books than the Reacher series.  I have read mysteries/thrillers/police procedurals most of my life, and I am now 70 years old.  I never think about dying except in terms of Lee Child.  How many more of his books will be published before I'm gone.  My idea of hell is missing the Reachers that come too late.   <br />HOW does he continue to write so beautifully???  As a previous Amazon reviewer commented, most  series begin to collapse after the first three or four books.  Not the Reacher series - Lee Childs is a national treasure!
B0000667RO|4.0|The Best of me indeed has a number of Bryan Adam Hits. Some of my favorites are here. Everything I do...., Have you ever really loved a woman, Please forgive me and Lets make a night to remember. There are other good songs as well like Summer of 69, Best of me, back to you. The only masterpiece that is missing in this album is the song I finally found someone a duet sung with the legendary Barbara Streisand. That would add another glitter to the best of collection. Not a bad collection after all.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|I wanted to like this new album, I really did.  However, after several sessions on the stereo, it just sounded worse each time.  Is AFI trying to play some horrible joke on their fan base?  Do they really think this is a good release?  This is nothing but silly pop music for the pre-teen MTV set.  It's seriously bad stuff, folks.  Very painful to see a band like AFI stumble so badly and hit the wall.  It's not just different.  It's poorly constructed music being performed by a group of soul-less \\"pod-people\\" (formerly known as AFI).
B0001XAPY2|2.0|maybe because I didn't like Porco. Everything was sub-par for me. Animation is definitely not as good as his later movies. Not enough weirdness, tried too much for the plot. Everything was just too ho-hum. As if he tried to carry the whole movie on Porco's shoulders. But once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and Porco was a pig there wasn't anything else there.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|It's too good to be true. Allow yourself to get excited about this one. Mac is back, baby!
B000FILW86|4.0|Let me start off by warning people that this band was even only to KISS in my heart in the 70s, so I am ultra critical in my judgement when they release a new album. The passion I had for this band starting on that day in late '78 when Dad brought me home Budokan(the yellow vinyl import version, which I think was the only one available at the time) was intense, and I've stuck with them through patchy albums(The Doctor), the \\"song doctor\\" years (Lap-Busted), and everything in-between. To me, nothing can touch the 1st album up to All Shook Up-period. Everything after that is a separate entity in my mind. Kind of like KISS after Love Gun, Van Halen after Roth, heck, after Fair Warning!, well, you get the idea. I'm a purist, so sue me LOL! OK, on to the review:<br /><br />Let's get the negatives out of the way quickly, and there's only 2-#1 is the first 12 seconds of Welcome To The World. Kinda, uh...G@Y is the only word that comes to mind, not in the Qweer Eye way, but, uh..maybe \\"corny\\" is a better word? OK, after that, WTTW is a cool enough song. Not a great opener, but I'll get over it. :>)<br /> Negative #2 is Come On Come On Come On. They already had a much better song with this title(ok, ok, that was only 2 C'mon C'mon's, I get it). It's just kind of a filler track, not bad, but just one of those average, sounds-like-it-was-written-in-5-minutes type of songs.<br /><br />  Now, let me say that Special One was a let down, not very immediate, very mid-tempo, etc. Some cool stuff on it(Pop Drone, Best Friend, My Obsession), a bit 'deeper' in some respects, but a bit lacking in great melodies, hooks, etc. All of the trademarks that make CT what they are were a bit AWOL on Special One. ROCKFORD makes up for it in spades. There are strong hooks, the great Beatle-esque melodies, loud guitars, and just better songs. I would say it has elements of Standing On The Edge(Little Sister type vibe), CT'97, mixed with some of the elements of classic 70s Trick. I'm not going to do a song-by-song analysis, but some highlights for me are All Those Years(a leftover from the Monster sessions that Tom originaly sang, now re-done with Robin AND Tom on the chorus). This song is excellent and it's great to hear Tom again on vocals. O Claire is an oldie from the 70s, if I remember right, that was never used, and it's a great, ELO-Lennon inspired song that could have been on All Shook Up right along with World's Greatest Lover. Dream The Night Away, Perfect Stranger, If It Takes A Lifetime are other highlights for me.<br /><br /> The 2 Jack Douglas assisted tracks are also great(Decaf & One More). Rick's guitar tone is a bit more \\"classic\\" sounding, and there's more dynamics. Considering CT's 1st album from '77 is my favorite Trick album, I'd love to see Douglas do a whole album with the band again.<br /><br />It's great to hear some strings and keyboards again, done the RIGHT way, not the cheesy 80s Doctor era samples and sound effects. I was always a fan of what Tom Werman did with the band in that regard, adding the Who's Next styled synth patterns and ELO-esque strings(Way Of The World)....it just adds so much depth and richness to the band's sound. I know the band has a negative feeling towards Werman, but I'd be curious to know how much he had to do with developing the band's trademark 70s sound. Now if only In Color didn't sound like a blanket was over the band as was as crisp and punchy as Dream Police...but I digress.<br /><br />  Rockford is in my estimation, the best thing they've done since Next Position Please. Yes, Standing On The Edge, Doctor, etc. all had a few great tracks on each album, but I'd say Rockford, unlike those albums, is solid almost all the way through. There's no She's Got Motion, Good Girls Go To Heaven, or Space to skip over on Rockford. I always said Enuff Znuff made more CT sounding albums in the late 80s/early 90s than CT themselves. Listen to New Thing off EZ's 1st album....now picture Robin singing it. See what Imean?? LOL<br /><br />Cheap Trick will probably never again sound like The Who/Beatles/Move/Elo influenced band of the 70s, so waiting for Dream Police II is wishful thinking. It seems that the band has moved away from that core set of influences ever since All Shook Up, and has morphed into another beast. The 80s definitely changed the band's sound and Rick's writing style, and that seems to be the groundwork for which everything since is based on. If you're cool with that, you will love this album. I give this album 4 stars, and the only thing keeping it from getting 5 is the fact that it's not one of the \\"untouchables\\" from 1977-80. Hey, I gotta have standards!

006074815X|4.0|I first read this book when I was 15, many, many years ago. It was great then but it hasn't aged with grace.  Though Follett is a pretty good writer, the best of later writers have surpassed him in suspense, action and drama.  <br /> <br />I would still recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. It's a solid book, but not as good as today's best thrillers. It's kinda old fashioned. It's not old enough to be a classic, yet it's too old to be still chic, it's like disco was in 1985.

B0009A1AS2|3.0|This album was actually frustrating to my ears. Why? Oh, simply because the title track is one of the best songs Dream Theater have written in the past 15 years, but the rest of the album is trite and crappy. I'll review the astounding title track in more detail:    Octavarium, the 24 minute beast shock-full of nuggets and references to other songs and albums and bands, has a very cool theme. The theme is, in a nutshell, how we move in circles. The story ends where it began. This is where we came in. Everything is a circle.     Octavarium has 5 parts. Someone Like Him, Medicate Me, Full Circle, Intervals, and Razor's Edge. To further emphasize the point of moving in circles, the album Octavarium ends with part V, and the album started with part VI (the album starts with Root of all Evil, the third song in Mike Portnoy's AA saga, and it starts with step or part VI).     Octavarium begins quite atmopherically, with Jordan Rudess heavily borrowing from Pink Floyd. The first three minutes or so of Octavarium are entirely dedicated to Mr. Rudess and his Continuum, a weird instrument that sounds like a heavily reverbed guitar and looks like a sort of pedal steel.     Then it kicks in, with the main keyboard melody of Octavarium (which is also the main vocal line of Medicate Me) starting. Then the song slows down, a quite georgeous acoustic guitar line starts from John Petrucci: James LaBrie starts singing over this, effectively starting Someone Like Him. This part of the song is very haunting, and it reiterates the point of Carpe Diem made by the other 20+ song in the Dream Theater oeuvre, A Change of Seasons.     Someone Like Him ends with Myung playing a very cool bass line that reminds me of Chris Squire. This bassline starts Medicate Me.     Medicate Me ends with James LaBrie singing \\"...can't you stop what's happening?\\". As soon as LaBrie sings that last \\"...ing\\" Jordan Rudess starts one of his best Dream Theater keyboard solos, and this lasts like three minutes. This part of Octavarium is one of Jordan Rudess's career highlights. This solo also starts off Full Circle, where the insane references to other pop culture piles up and up. For the next 3-5 minutes after the last words in Full Circle, it is all Rudess and Petrucci (who had laid back for the first half or so of the song). Rudess and Petrucci do this crazy chromatic unison run very reminiscent of the unisons in Metropolis part 1. Then Intervals starts, with James LaBrie referencing every song on the album. This leads to LaBrie screaming TRAPPED INSIDE THIS OCTAVARIUM four times.    Razor's Edge, one of the most beautiful parts of a song in the entire Dream Theater catalogue, has only two verses. After the singing is done, Petrucci solos. It is one of the best and most beautiful and atmospheric and downright jaw dropping solos Petrucci has ever played.     Octavarium ends with an F note.     Now, as you see above, I love the Octavarium title track very much. So you see how frustrating it is for me to try to listen to the other crappy songs on the album.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|This 2005 film won Felicity Huffman an academy award nomination.  I can understand why because it is a difficult, complex and subtle role and requires fine acting ability.  She sure does show it too.  She's cast a woman named Bree, formerly known as a man named Sidney.  She's has been living as a woman for several years and is about to undergo a sex change operation, been working hard to achieve this goal, undergoing years of physiological therapy and always wears lace and satin and meticulous makeup.  She's a quiet person with a deep sense of decorum and works hard at two jobs in order to save up the money for the operation.  She feels she is a woman in every way but one.<br /><br />Then, from out of the blue, she discovers that she has fathered a son 17 years before.  The young man, played by Kevin Zegers, is a street hustler.  She lives in Los Angeles but she flies to New York to bail him out of jail.  And now begins their cross country drive to the west coast.  She has to be back in LA for the surgery.  And he wants to go west so he can become a porn star.  She doesn't tell him her true identity.  He thinks she is a church lady who wants to reform him.<br /><br />The scene is now set for conflict and drama.  Some of it is humorous but the humor is a quiet chuckle, not the kind that makes me laugh out loud.  Mostly, it made me do some deep thinking about human nature.  I enjoyed the film with one caveat however.  Felicity Huffman never seemed like a man.  She was always a woman to me.  Maybe that's because I've seen her work in Desperate Housewives which is very much about women.  And maybe it's just because I knew she was a real woman all along.<br /><br />Generally though, I think this was a fine film with a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Ms. Huffman.  Recommended.
B00005JLEU|4.0|What is so great about the last 5 Miyazaki movies? I'd say not much. There's certainly a lot of good stuff, unparalleled animation, and more unparalleled animation. But once you get past the novelty of the weirdness, the strange creatures, what do you have? Not much. There isn't really much of a plot here. C'mon, to those who talk about the symbolism or the deeper meaning, do you really think you know what goes on in Miyazaki's mind? The guy keeps getting pulled out of retirement, maybe in there is some statement that he just wants to stay retired.     And to those who say Miyazaki is their 7 year old's favorite director, c'mon! OK, maybe they like Totoro (and Barney), but don't let them see Spirited Away, otherwise they'll be so scared they'll end up sleeping in your bed until they're 13. His last 5 movies should never be allowed to be watched by any 7 year old by any responsible parent.     Look at it this way, Miyazaki is only revered now because he's only done 1/2 dozen such movies, if he'd done 30 movies like this we'd all be yawning. People are highly rating this stuff because it's novel and chic to rate it high.     Miyazaki cannot be pigeonholed. He doesn't want to be your kid's favorite director, nor does he want to be the chic director of the year only to be tossed like dirty laundry by the next Tom Cruise movie that comes out.     This movie has serious animation, period. Miyazaki gets a 5 star for the breadth of his work. This movie gets a solid 3.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|The Unrated Collector's Edition is for anyone who saw the original in theaters and wished that there had been just a little less rushing.  The Unrated edition adds more than ten minutes of extra footage -- mostly adding a couple of minutes to each of the big fight sequences (most noticeably, the car chase scene, where some extra dialogue is added).  The second disc includes many behind-the-scenes bits on the cinematography and direction, as well as script development.  Not a bad choice for those who don't own another version, and true fans of the movie.
B00006JDVV|5.0|This was a very good film. I'm surprised it was a sleeper hit. It may seem like a typical post-apocalyptic type movie but they took the old fairy tale stories and myths about dragons and made an original story. They should have made this into a television series.
6305313687|3.0|Bad script.  Stupid plot.  But I liked almost everything else about the film.  And Edward Norton's performance was great.  He is a fine actor who has a natural mastery of difficult roles and made me feel that he actually WAS the skinhead he portrayed. American History X is set in Venice Beach, California, a hotbed of racial tension and it's time that someone finally was willing to deal with this problem in a film.<br /><br />Ed Norton plays the role of a skinhead who has a change of attitude while in prison and then tries to keep his younger brother from following in his footsteps.  There's lots of brutality and violence.  And lots of excellent directing.  Flashbacks are in black and white.  There are good uses of slow motion and cuts.  But not every performance was as stellar as Norton's, and there was way too much psycho-babble instead of some thought-provoking scenes.<br /><br />Recommended for the curious, but it is certainly not a great film.
1400079179|3.0|Weak sequel to Angels and Demons. I thought A&D was much better than this one and I think Dan Brown tried to do a follow up to A&D with a different premise, but the plot is pretty much the same: a treasure hunt from city to city.<br /><br />I believe this one was overhyped because of it's premise, lucky Dan Brown. Otherwise it would be a very ho-hum book, not even as good as some of his early ones.<br /><br />The bad thing about it is it's spawned a whole bunch of copycats and accessory books, the authors of which should all send in 50% of their paycheck to Dan Brown since he's singlehandly responsible for it. And it's bad because none of them are any good, none that I've read anyway.<br /><br />If you've just woken up in a cave, don't buy this book, get it from the library. If you have this book, donate it to the library so Dan Brown and the publishers won't make any more money. We don't want to reward him and have more bad books written.
B00005MP58|5.0|This particular version from A&E / BBC is one of the best produced versions of this classic novel I have ever seen.  It will take some time to get through the entire epic, but well worth the time.  The story, actors, and shots of beautiful homes, and countryside will sweep you away.  You will be entranced in the world of Jane Austin, and wonder where the time has gone.  You'll even count the minutes till you can pop in disk two, just to see if perhapes Mr. Darcey and Elizabeth actually do get together!
B000002LKU|5.0|Sixteen years after its release, on the recommendation of a friend, I ordered \\"Missing...presumed having a good time.\\" As promised by other reviewers, it is a total delight, akin to discovering J.J. Cale's \\"Naturally\\" decades ago. Understated tight guitar, the presence of pedal steel, dobro, the occasional accordion or marimba and swelling of strings in the background, the traded-off vocals and resurrection of traditional gems keep this one delivering cut after cut. A 1951 Louvin Brothers-penned \\"Weapon of Prayer\\" renders Neil Young's, Natalie Maine's, Bruce Springsteen's and Billie Joe Armstrong's war protests histrionic by comparison. This CD is richly rewarding. A totally safe gamble for you to make.
0156027321|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The story of the little boys start in life, how he finds religion, some of the images and thoughts stayed with me even though I read it ages ago. Very creative and highly satisfying in a way that few books are. I have urged my family and friends to read it, however, a number of people disliked the brutality described as everyone fights for survival and didn't enjoy it as much as I did.
0451216725|4.0|Above average. Easy to read, classic Follett writing style, if you just read a paragraph it could be any book of his. But...... it's dated. <br /> <br />SPOILERS AHEAD ~~~ <br />The premise, that the protagonist wakes up with a loss of memory and as a homeless person, knowing that he is really someone else, might have been thrilling 10 years ago, but I've read at least 1/2 a dozen books with a plot that starts like that now. And the plotline doesn't really make sense. Why would someone like Elspeth want to be a KGB agent anyway? Her reasoning doesn't make sense based on the character that Follett has created. A person like her would want to have Luke's kids and to heck with the KGB or CIA. And no reason is given for Anthony's switch to the KGB, probably because Follett couldn't think of a reason either.  <br /> <br />What Follett's strength is, and has always been is that he writes the characters with great depth and his books are easy to read and follow. Just for that he gets 4 stars. If you're a Follett fan you'll have read this book anyway, if you're not, and you're a picky reader you won't like this.
B00049QQHI|5.0|This movie was gripping from the start to finish. I loved how it opened- a bunch of kids who obviously have minds of their own- getting high off of some household cleaner or something, skipping school, ripping off hot dog carts.. and you think this all seems crazy but then ultimately all the hard core drug usage starts and while at first it may seem like nothing but a small enjoyable thing to do- it soon is a huge habit for Jim.  <br /> <br />Watching all the struggles Jim has to go through- loosing friends, trying to be clean & then failing, prostitution, begging for money, getting into physical fights.. - it is hard to watch and you physically can't believe that someone can go through so much and come out victorious in the end.  <br /> <br />Leonardo plays this role FANTASTICALLY. Especially the part when he is crying at the door begging for some money from his mother. The amount of passion he pours into this character is huge... for that reason alone- go see this movie.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Dammit, this is not pretentious.  There was a time in rock when bands not only had the ambition to make something different and challenging, but actually did it with the blessing of their record company.  And people bought the stuff in droves.  Yes were enormously popular at this time, and people liked their ambitions.  This is one of my all time favorite albums.  I loved the fact that in its original LP format, it had 4 side long songs, roughly 20 minutes apiece.  It is a work not dissimilar to a long work by any famous composer.  I love all the tracks here.  From the intense opening verse of The Revealing Science of God to the playfulness of Ritual, this maybe Yes's greatest album.  While punk musicians hated bands like Yes, ELP, and Pink Floyd, these bands' music has outlasted any crap punk threw (sometimes literally) at us.  The punk bands that went on changed their musical outlook (like The Clash..their later work was much more ambitious than their earlier stuff) made lasting work.  Do not fault those who are ambitious and are trying new things...fault yourself...
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|The new album from Rihanna, A Girl Like Me, is so much better than her debut. I was actually surprised listening to it when I bought it, because i didn't expect what I heard  <br /> <br />1. S.O.S.- Of course, the first #1 single. This is such a fun club banger and its fun to drive fast to in the car! The beat is on pont and her vocals sound great here, as all singles do.  <br /> <br />2. Kisses Don't Lie- ok, this song is very different. it takes you back to her reggae roots and really gets you moving. It's not really a fast paced song, but the chorus is very catchy and makes you wanna sing along! <br /> <br />3. Unfaithful- This is probably the best song on the album. It was written by her labelmate and singer, Ne-Yo. It's a catchy slow jam that actually makes sense. It turns the tables around and shows what it's like to be the cheater, rather than being the one getting cheated on. <br /> <br />4. We Ride- This song is very fun to listen to and ride to lol. It has more of an R&B sound to it, but it is fun to listen and bob your head to. <br /> <br />5. Dem Haters- I like this song a lot because of the lyrics. It has a strong reggae sound to it, but it's still very true. It's kind of slow moving, but once it's over, you want to hear it again <br /> <br />6. Final Goodbye- This is another ballad on the album that I wasn't really fond of. It's a very good song, but her vocals just aren't there. I think it would've been better if she would've expanded her range a little bit and banged the song out at the end. <br /> <br />7. Break It Off- I love this song! the only problem is that it seems more like a Sean Paul song. Rihanna has one verse and sings the chorus. thats it. Its a very fun song and the beat is great. <br /> <br />8. Crazy Little Thing Called Love- I didn't like this song at all. I always skip it. It's a reggae song that's just a filler for the CD. <br /> <br />9. Selfish Girl- I feel the same way for this song as I did for the last one. Another reggae songthat just doesn't do anything for me. <br /> <br />10. P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You)- This is a great slow jam that makes you wanna sing along. The beat is nice and Rihanna sounds great on the track. I can relate to the lyrics in the song. It's very catchy and touching. <br /> <br />11. A Girl Like Me- This is another slow jam that just talks about how different she is. It's a good song and good choice for the albums theme song. The beat is hot too. <br /> <br />12. A Million Miles Away- This ballad reminds me of \\"Now I Know\\" from her first album, but you can tell she's worked on her vocals a lot because this song is touching and sad. It brings tears to my eyes sometimes. The piano with her voice sounds so nice together. <br /> <br />13. If It's Lovin That You Want (Remix)- The beat on this track is amazing. I love it more than the original, just because of the beat. For the most part, it matches well with the way it's originally sung. It's definetely a hot track, and it was smart to add another dance song on the album. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is very good and I hope you'll be pleased by it, as I was.
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|I am not a big fan of Pat Metheny -- I don't know much about his other CDs, but I have to say that I absolutely love this one. The song Last Train Home is probably one of my favorite songs of all time. There is just something about it that takes my breath away. The same can also be said of the other songs on the disc as well. I highly recommend this CD.
B00006LLNU|3.0|At least in concept, this album is an excercise in minimalism. That is not to say, stripped down music like Spoon's \\"Kill the Moonlight.\\" The lush instrumentation and lighted vocals characteristic of Sigur Ros remain. But, this is an album with: <br />a) No title <br />b) No song titles <br />c) Blank pages instead of liner notes in the album booklet. <br />d) The use of one lone phrase for all vocals on the album (you-cy-low) <br />This isn't a big stretch if you have heard their music. The concept was to let the sounds be interpreted specially for each individual, and it does. But this album is a *relative* failure compared to Takk and especially Agaetis Byrjun. Relative is key, because the angelic music still puts them leagues above other bands in originality and ambience.  <br /> <br />Rather simply, this isn't Sigur Ros' best work. The other two albums are far more cohesive, easily listenable in their durations. ( ) sounds much better by picking out one song at a time. Honestly, listening to the whole thing at once will put me to sleep. Given a pick of one such track, I would chose the 4th, this albums most amazing song, and one of Sigur Ros' best. You see, the whole \\"you-cy-low\\" thing works for one 6.5 minute epic song. But when the whole album is deriviatives of this, you wish that those Hopelandish speakers would broaden their vocabulary. <br /> <br />All in all, I wouldn't deterr you from giving this album a listen. But, I would strongly suggest that any music fan could distinguish the superiority of Takk and Agaetis. At least listen to the 6 minute epic that is Untitled #4. <br /> <br />Rating: 7.0/10.0
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Commercials made this movie seem a lot more humourous than it is, using the few instances of Yuri talking about arms dealing like he's a company spokesman, but that has little to do with the overall tone of the movie. Nonetheless it drew me in quickly with it's unique no-nonsense realism and conversational tone, leading me to think it could be a great film early on, but when it started to jump rather than flow from one thing to another I didn't feel like I was watching a story unfold as much as being given a bunch of puzzle pieces to put together. It has a lot of great parts, many of which are informative about the international arms trade, but it's pretty impossible to rate it as a whole, because it never really becomes one. It tries to do too much, and the amount of shifts in focus, redirections of viewer attention, ended up leaving me not fully invested in the outcome(s). There's also a difficulty in suspending disbelief as Nicolas Cage plays the same character over a 10+ year period. Overall though I think this movie is interesting and unique enough to be worth recommending.  <br />
0060512806|4.0|Having read so many complaints about the book's ending, I feel compelled to throw in my own two cents (without giving anything away). I thought the very ending-- with the symbolic and poetic power of its final image, with its resonance with (and contrast to) the claustrophobic secrecy of the whole book up to that point-- as well as a further development of the Lord of the Rings resonance-- was beautiful.    Not the greatest book I've ever read; it certainly pales compared to Gravity's Rainbow (which this book feels like, at least for the first half). But make no mistake-- Stephenson knew exactly what he was doing with the ending!
B000E97HIA|5.0|That sums it up. This is a return to booty rocking funky A$$ Prince! The man is in his 40s and he can still bring it. He's a musical genius, and I'm happy he has the freedom to make the music HE wants and isn't worrying about airplay. Good CD, great artist, and I hope young people give him a chance and discover what a real musician can do.
B000002LIX|5.0|... and this is the last, most literate treatise on the sparks that fly between those three discrete phenomena that I can remember. Nothing has come close ever since: this is the quintessential Los Angeles spaced-out, drugged-out rock slab upon which millions of minds were soul-sacrificed since the day of release.<br /><br />\\"Ritual\\" is a bright light among the used bins, screaming out at you from two (!!!) distinct and meaningful slices of cover art, and if memory serves me, I snatched up both for the hell of it. The first listen was at a party on a sweltering summer afternoon into spacy hot evening, the CD thrust upon me by a buddy who was also in a pretty popular indie-rock band at the time who claimed to have been inspired and changed already, two days after its release. I bought it the next day. I made out to it, listened to it on road trips, put it on mixtapes for friends, stared at the cover, set it in stone. I carried the novena thingy in my wallet for a while too.<br /><br />A little context: the pseudo-political ramblings of a very heady Perry were consistent with the open-eyed awakening of (true) gen-X youth of the time: a time when there was no internet spoon-feeding and word-of-mouth was the order of the day. I seem to recall a real stream of interest in generational politics and a true alternative ethic: Fugazi and the whole DC thing were exploding in air, Douglas Coupland had just written his book, China and Eastern Europe were simmering and worldwide global crapola was everywhere. The state of the environment was resurrected as a social issue. We were finally figuring out that we had to live in a world with something called AIDS. Even frivolous pop-culture stuff like \\"My Own Private Idaho\\" was part of this generational, twenty-something awakening. \\"Ritual\\" was the soundtrack to this revolution of the mind that seemed to be erupting in my heart and those of my friends. Something was changing.<br /><br />The album is brilliant. Nothing is filler. It was like a scream from L.A., and the music was all over the map. Perry's vocals were attacks. The rhythm section was apocalyptic and buzzing. And good grief - Navarro - the first Guitar God of the 90's - what ground he didn't cover in the initial five tracks is mopped up with sonic reverb and melancholy in the end, a wan, wasted vision closing with the underrated \\"Classic Girl\\", a sunset to a sonic excursion on a scope with the very best epic rock from any era. This was the 90's at its doorstep, and \\"Ritual\\" set the tone for the entire decade, with a truly astonishing and fertile underground scene earthquaking in its afterglow. Everything that came after seemed to spring from this source: from Jawbox to grrl rock (Babes, L7, and so on), from shoegaze to garage rock (did MBV and Dinosaur really tour? what I wouldn't give today), from music to movies to political activism to interpersonal change... everything just erupted after \\"Ritual\\". Just erupted.<br /><br />The importance, vision, and intensity of this album cannot be overstated. It's one for the ages.r. It was like a scream from L.A., and the music was all over the map.

B00005JKLZ|3.0|H.G. Wells was, let's say, a mediocre socialist, journalist and historian who brilliantly and imaginatively wrote social commentary and criticism in the form of science fiction. He wrote a good number of other things too, but he is best known for his science fiction, and for good reason; among his writings, his science fiction is undisputedly the best, and, among science fiction authors, he is undisputedly one of the greatest of all time. In the 1960 George Pal movie version of Wells' classic, The Time Machine, one of the characters is made to pose the question at the end: If you were reduced to having access to only three books, which three would you choose? If I were forced to choose between the Communist Manifesto and The Time Machine as one of my selections, I would definitely choose The Time Machine.<br /><br />That being said, however, the first thing I would say about the 2002 Dreamworks film, 'The Time Machine,' is that it does not succeed as an adaptation of Wells' novel. Some of the characters names are the same, some of the dates are the same, the title is the same--there is a time machine in both--and that is pretty near the end of the resemblance. To see how far the film departs from the novel, perhaps it can suffice to point out that whereas Wells' story avoids the problem of 'temporal paradox,' simply in terms of the events and action, the plot of this movie completely hinges upon it, even in terms of motive. Perhaps it could be seen as a simplified--or amplified--Wells, but none of the characters or situations resemble enough those of the novel; the only thing in common is a divided future humanity which has evolved into cannibalism, which, by itself, simply does not offer enough to tell a story. So we are really left only with what hinges on the temporal paradox narrative.<br /><br />That being said, is it fair to compare this movie to the book, or to the 1960 version, which was loosely based upon it? Well, yes, to this extent: Is it fair to say that the author of the 2002 screenplay deserves the title--based on this new yarn--as one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time? Answer: no.<br /><br />That being said, is the movie any good? Yes.<br /><br />The story, it seems to me, only succeeds in speaking about technology 'going too far.' A scientist, who at first thinks 'there is no such thing' as going too far with technology, eventually changes his mind--too late for his first romance (in 1899)--but in time for his second (800,000 years later). At first he has a great passion for science, but this soon gets subordinated to his intention to change the past for personal (albeit humanly understandable) reasons. He makes a time machine. It works, but it doesn't work; he can go back in time, but he can't change the past. Dazed, and forgetting his training in elementary logic, he can't understand why, and takes a needless trip into the future instead of re-reading his logic books. Along the way he finds more evidence that technology never really does what it is supposed to, and gradually decides to join the native castaways of the future, using (and sacrificing) his machine to try to at least undo the damage that technology over the millennia has done, at least in terms of its effects on the future (he can't use the machine for the purpose it was constructed, but that is true for all machines, so that is no criticism of it). And so: he was 'a man ahead of his time' (maybe so--for 1899--at least for a professor of applied mechanics).<br /><br />A thin story line, but fun, with due references made to both Wells' novel and the 1960 film (given its title), complete with satisfying cameo appearances for those thinking that the movie might have something to do with the novel by Wells.<br /><br />Having said that, it can also be said that the film does succeed and even earn a niche, on a visceral and visual level, among cinematic depictions of time travel. This is perhaps best summarized and underscored by some footage for the film's opening scenes (one that, I think mistakenly, was dropped to the cutting room floor): the hero is shown demonstrating a Crookes' Radiometer (also known as a light mill), whose vanes (inside a bulb) are propelled into a circular motion by sunshine. We see this image throughout the film; most notably by the time machine itself, with its spinning Fresnel, 'lighthouse' lenses, which, upon fully opening through centrifugal forces, even as the buds of a flower, somehow serve to bend light so as to embrace and enclose the time machine in a 'sphere of electromagnetic radiation' (interestingly, the light starts out as two funnels, facing in opposite directions and connected at the spout--somewhat resembling the 'light cones' of the special theory of relativity--with this analogy, one could say that when the light is bent into a sphere, the 'past' and 'future' of the 'light cone' join, whereas the machine gets placed into 'elsewhere,' as it becomes enclosed in the sphere). We also notably see this image with the exotic windmills of the future Eloi, who evidently construct them simply for the purpose of remembering the dead. In between we see it more subtly, with the daily sun forming a band in the sky (an image from Wells' novel) as the time machine begins its first journey forward; we see it suggested by the spokes of the bicycles of the future; we see it in the moon which breaks apart and then gradually over eons begins to form a ring around the earth; we even see it even in AI hologram, who is self-described as, 'photonic,' and appears only through or behind one of a number of glass panes (which collectively form something like a Fresnel lens). All of this well functions in contrast to the Morlock, who hide from the sun as they seek to retreat from every contingency, from every 'what if.' Not once but twice are we shown the moon in association with hero's first romance, but also, in a very different form, with his second. Especially memorable along these lines is the time machine's entrance into geological time, with musical score waxing strong, where we witness the formation of a ring-like natural arch of rock, as well as the cutting out of a canyon by a river, on the sides of which the Eloi will be found to erect their unique architecture for dwelling. How could the hero still, 'blame the poor bastard who tore the stone from the earth,' for simply having provided the fateful engagement ring for his fianc&eacute;? If anywhere, the blame could only now fall to the Morlock-like thief who emerged at night from the bushes in Central Park, wearing his bowler hat. There was also some interesting dialogue in the deleted scene, where the time traveler explains to his students about 'differentials' being needed to overcome 'stagnation.'<br /><br />Yet all of this is still to wasted opportunity. The film does compare the time traveler with the Morlock insofar as, faced with loss, he wanted to retreat from contingency. A fine theme, as far as it goes, but nothing is really done with it.  The film does seem to have some kind of backhanded recognition that human beings are more than machines. There is also a fairly serious subtext dealing with irreplaceable loss and taking responsibility for the future. But here the movie is unable to take itself seriously, and the themes are not developed. In a way, they are even contradicted. It is eventually explained to the time traveler that his machine didn't quite work as he wished because precisely his motive was too personal (read, tragedy). What then is it to go 'too far?' Is the answer like the joke about which is worse, ignorance or apathy: 'I don't know and I don't care'---?  On this level the movie cannot be taken seriously. Its critique of technology is even 1950ish. At best, a sci-fi companion to 'The Emerald Forest.' At worst, it's a Godzilla on Gilligan's Island. Great grandson Simon Wells did a reasonable job directing it; too bad he didn't have the opportunity to direct a serious attempt to put the classic novel to film. I don't mean to say, however, that he therefore has something to be ashamed of; H.G. himself apparently had some role in the Hollywood version of 'The Invisible Man'--which was fairly comic--and this version of 'The Time Machine,' has an effective share of humor, also.  It also just happens to have some serious plot flaws, not limited to an occasional bizarre gaffe which could be easily extracted from the story without changing it (like the gaffe that his time machine, which was intended only to go back in time several years, just happens to have an elaborately constructed instrument panel, obviously mechanical and built with precise tolerances, able to display, to the day, a journey 800,000 years into the future).<br /><br />The high point was good special effects and music, though Guy Pearce and Samantha Mumba give memorable performances. For the Morlocks, Jeremy Irons is also memorable; for the rest of them, the combination of costumes, puppets and CGI was very well done and even (at times) seamless.  Mumba's real life younger brother was especially charming as an Eloi who befriends the time traveler.  The hokey portrayal of 2030 AD, however, insults the audience (a fusion powered computer which lasts 800,000 years?)--though the masses in NYC riding bicycles China style was a fun touch (while the time traveler was so fascinated, then sorely jaded, with an early 'horseless buggy' in 1899, upon his first stop in the future, he is confronted with neither cars nor horses)--and the brief flirtation with a woman unlocking her bike, commenting on the time machine, was an effective moment. What will people make of this watching it in 2030 plus? Though Orlando Jones holds his own (one of the great lines references the 'complete works of Martha Stewart' as a reading suggestion), it seems to me that the comic relief of the computer AI hologram from said year is, in terms of sci-fi, somewhat of a rip off of Robbie the Robot from Forbidden Planet and/or Data from Star Trek (perhaps a cross between the two). On the other hand, the movie is also complete with cryptic islandific BN for the many moments when the audience is likely too bored to pay attention to the story. But there are better places to look for that. There is an attention to detail in the film that does suggest a serious effort (even the engagement ring was made of moonstone); perhaps the original screenplay was more elaborate, but simply wound up truncated, for one reason or another, by the time they finished the final edit. Maybe they thought the film was too long; maybe they realized it lacked coherence. Was it the moon that blew up or the screenplay?  But the trip wasn't necessary; a classic story with the same name was already available. It is said that the (yes, fantastic) prop of the time machine itself took a year to make; also a wasted opportunity is the total reliance on CGI for the time travel sequences, instead of using that year to also do some time-lapse photography. Yet the far greater wasted opportunity lay in wasting all the film's merits, from casting and direction, to acting as well as to cinematography, on a jellybean script.  In the novel, the time traveler was actually a recipient of flowers: &#34;two strange white flowers--shriveled now, and brown and flat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength are gone, gratitude and mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man.&#34;  Pearce and Mumba almost succeed to rescue the screenplay, but not quite.  Mumba was particularly memorable the way she motionlessly 'rolls her eyes' without batting an eye, as she responds with a dead-pan 'oh' to Guy Pearce's explanation as to how he arrived there, by traveling in time, immediately proceeding to describe him to the villagers simply as a 'wandering idiot' to protect him.  Pearce also does a good job in showing a gradual transformation in the character; but from wandering idiot to superhero, is just not enough to thicken the plot.<br /><br />What, do movie makers really think that audiences are just plain too stupid to appreciate the ideas of a classic, even if a mere 100 page, novel?<br /><br />BYOP (bring your own popcorn)<br /><br />Having said all of that, I do admit I really wanted to like this movie.  In a way, I do like it, just not as much as I wanted.  I also hold no grudges; it has even grown on me.  At home, the film is good for playing in the background while doing something else; good music, nice images, not too distracting, and a gentle reminder to accomplish something before eons pass away, including perhaps a modest tip of the hat to Erich Fromm's, 'To Have or To Be.'<br /><br />All that being said, I wish to say that Dreamworks has a pretty good batting average for producing decent entertainment.<br /><br />5+ especially for Dreamworks' computer generated but also hand drawn animation (having just the right balance): SPIRIT.<br /><br />***<br /><br />FWIW, some additional explanation and analysis of the plot:<br /><br />While the time traveler did not succeed to change the past as he wished, he did succeed to change the occasion of his fianc&eacute;'s demise, from mugging to auto accident.  This near miss, is important for the story, for it is the reason he decides to go into the future.  Of course, it is also the case that the mere change in autopsy, per se, evidently made no difference to him; one mishap is exchanged for another, two flukes beyond his control with the same bitter result.  So, perhaps we are supposed to imagine, he indeed made the time machine (again) anyway?  Or maybe he left a note to himself, to be opened in 1903 or something, to finish the machine, but not to bother to try to go back and save her, as he already tried and it's no use?  Or the note said, 'wait until you hear from you again,' that is, after I-you-we take my-our-your first trip into the future to decide how to go about it?  Or perhaps he does go into the past again--and again--only to then go into the far future, again and again?  Maybe the reason he decides to hightail out of the past and not stick around was precisely to avoid seeing the mess of an infinitely regressing dog pile that he had set in motion?  Perhaps we are even to imagine that out of all these journeys, only 'one of him' actually makes it as far as 800,000 years into the future, to keep things simple; perhaps the rest die (or gets arrested amid various stops ranging between 2031-2036), or something?  Fine.  We can skip all that.  What we see is the time traveler, nearly a million years later, waking up dazed.  He had called his colleagues 'dinosaurs' only to witness the automobiles, which he once admired so much, to suffer a dinosaur fate.  His masterstroke of the time machine only succeeded in having his fianc&eacute; die at the hands of this latter group of mechanical dinosaurs.  Retreating into the future, he then witnesses another accidental destruction, this time of the moon.  Retreating further, he sees a divided humanity with the more technologically adept engaged in cannibalism.  Though in some way rationalizing, the Morlock in the film will even explain the reason the human race began to prey on itself was for lack of resources, after they blew up the moon; he also blames the time traveler and what he stood for.  Exactly what did he stand for?<br /><br />Perhaps the screenwriter (in the spirit of Wells' socialism) also intended the albino uber-Morlock to be the counterpart to the Dean of Columbia who (in the deleted scene) advised Pearce to give up his already forming ideas of time travel and join something like his study, 'on the benefits of tobacco smoking' (a pressure to which Pearce would cave if only his fianc&eacute; had lived). Was the declaration of going 'too far' with technology, as he gazed on a shattered moon, simply supposed to mean that he realized he was dumb to rely on a time machine--and a virtual librarian & library of the future--even to get his answer as to why he can't change the past (instead of on his own paper & sewn bound logic books)?  Would the time traveler then represent the ivory tower intellectual that cares for nothing more than writing equations on a blackboard and bourgeois private romances?  Fine.  We can skip all that.  How would remedying these defects provide a remedy to any, let alone all, the accidents of history--or comedy of errors--the film depicts?  The mishaps simply upstage and cover the tracks of any more subtly conceived plot.  Even the mugging was fatal due to a gun going off accidentally.  So we could better say that the time traveler in this movie simply represents the accident prone first mate, of the shipwrecked 'Minnow,' on 'Gilligan's Island.'  Alas, poor Emma, she just couldn't catch a break about the flowers she's always asking for (any more than Ginger could get a decent acting job after she met Gilligan).  800,000 years later, Mara at least knows enough to look for flowers herself; refreshingly, she is also a pretty good doctor, linguist and archaeologist (Ginger likewise found a few hidden talents while on the island).  There is really no sense to be made of this film, except that, according to it, science and technology are just accidents waiting to happen.  We don't have to retreat from it; just don't expect too much from it.  As for this film, try as you might, you won't find anything more in it.  Understatement is not always the same thing as nuance.<br /><br />The Morlock's explanation, 'I am the inescapable result of you,' could be summarized even more simply, as a big bluff:  'Your caring about people only results in the grotesque, sociopathic cannibal you see before you.  So give it up and go home.'<br /><br />Then Gilligan says, 'what if...' stumbles and blows up his machine, and saves the day.o). On the other hand, the movie is also complete with cryptic islandific BN for the many moments when the audience is likely too bored to pay attention to the story. But there are better places to look for that.

Retreating into the future, he then witnesses another accidental destruction, this time of the moon.  Retreating further, he sees a divided humanity with the more technologically adept engaged in cannibalism.  Though in some way rationalizing, the Morlock in the film will even explain the reason the human race began to prey on itself was for lack of resources, after they blew up the moon; he also blames the time traveler and what he stood for.  Exactly what did he stand for?    Perhaps the screenwriter (in the spirit of Wells' socialism) also intended the albino uber-Morlock to be the counterpart to the Dean of Columbia who (in the deleted scene) advised Pearce to give up his already forming ideas of time travel and join something like his study, 'on the benefits of tobacco smoking' (a pressure to which Pearce would cave if only his fiancé had lived). Was the declaration of going 'too far' with technology, as he gazed on a shattered moon, simply supposed to mean that he realized he was dumb to rely on a time machine--and a virtual librarian & library of the future--even to get his answer as to why he can't change the past (instead of on his own paper & sewn bound logic books)?  Would the time traveler then represent the ivory tower intellectual that cares for nothing more than writing equations on a blackboard and bourgeois private romances?  Fine.  We can skip all that.   How would remedying these defects provide a remedy to any, let alone all, the accidents of history--or comedy of errors--the film depicts?  The mishaps simply upstage and cover the tracks of any more subtly conceived plot.  Even the mugging was fatal due to a gun going off accidentally.  So we could better say that the time traveler in this movie simply represents the accident prone first mate, of the shipwrecked 'Minnow,' on 'Gilligan's Island.'  Alas, poor Emma, she just couldn't catch a break about the flowers she's always asking for (any more than Ginger could get a decent acting job after she met Gilligan).  800,000 years later, Mara at least knows enough to look for flowers herself; refreshingly, she is also a pretty good doctor, linguist and archaeologist (Ginger likewise found a few hidden talents while on the island).  There is really no sense to be made of this film, except that, according to it, science and technology are just accidents waiting to happen.  We don't have to retreat from it; just don't expect too much from it.  As for this film, try as you might, you won't find anything more in it.  Understatement is not always the same thing as nuance.  The Morlock's explanation, 'I am the inescapable result of you,' could be summarized even more simply, as a big bluff:  'Your caring about people only results in the grotesque, sociopathic cannibal you see before you.  So give it up and go home.'    Then Gilligan says, 'what if...' stumbles and blows up his machine, and saves the day.
B00006L83N|5.0|My first impression of Symphony X was that they were another Dream Theater clone. I am taking back my initial incorrect impression and believe they are one of the current innovators of the progressive metal scene. This disc is stunning. Michael Romeo is a gifted guitarist and a killer songwriter. Russell Allen's vocals can change from calming to brutal in a heartbeat and his tone is fantastic. Michael Pinella is a very tasty keyboard player who plays the perfect riff or chord at the right time. Jason Rullo (drums) and Michael Lepond (bass) provide the intense lock-and-load rhythm section, albeit, I wish the bass was a little louder in the mix. Both Pinella, and Lepond share some of the songwriting duties and Allen writes a good portion of the lyrics. <br /> <br />Most of the songs are heavy with lots of distorted guitar crunch but there are calmer moments, for example, parts of the twenty-four minute \\"The Odyssey\\" are classically influenced with beautiful orchestrated arrangements. There is not one clunker on the disc and is extremely recommended for fans of this style of music. <br />
B000ESSTKG|5.0|i got both violator and music for the masses last night and they are well worth the 22.99 asking price.  as the gentleman below mentioned, the sound quality is incredibly improved. this won't matter much to the average fan, but to mode-geeks like me, it's a godsend.  i won't go into the details of the album, because if you already own music for the masses, you already know what a great album it is.<br /><br />the documentary included is great.  as with the violator album, it's great to hear david bascombe, the album's producer, talk about the the making of the album.  the creative process has always fascinated me and getting a behind-the-scenes look at 'masses' is a treat.  to hear dave bascombe say the intro to 'never let me down again' was a 'happy accident' was a treat. it was also great to see how 'masses' made depeche mode one of the biggest acts in the world.  it's not every band, you know, that can sell 70,000 seats at the rose bowl. as with 'violator,' you'll get plenty of interviews with the band, the most impressive of which, in my opinion, is the interview with alan wilder.  you can't help but be impressed with the man and wish he were still a part of the band.<br /><br />for life-long depeche mode fans, these reissues are fantastic. sure, they could've had a few more bells and whistles, but the audio is first-rate, the dvd is fantastic, and listening and watching will take you back to the time when depeche mode were the center of the known universe.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I have never written an online review before, but I was compelled to speak up with the recent cancelling of this wonderful show and the networks refusal to release any additional seasons of Everwood unless the first season sells more copies.  I have owned this DVD set for some time now and I love it! It has all 23 first season episodes, and for many who may have fallen in love with Everwood in the last couple of years, I would highly recommend going back to the beginning and finding out what kep so many of us tuned in for all four years!!  This is an extremely affordable set (less than $17 for a full season of a 1 hour drama is unheard of!!!) and even if you have never watched Everwood, if you are a fan of quality television (especially if you are a fan of Gilmore Girls, as some of stated before) I encourage you to check it out!
B000ESSTL0|5.0|violator can best be summed up with one word: vindication.  the worldwide phenomenon that was 'violator' was the culmination of years of critics slagging them off and little mainstreet success.  if you're looking at this webpage, you already know all about violator's brilliance, so i'll spare you the review.<br /><br />during my teenage years my world literally revolved around depeche mode. i had the subway posters, the t-shirts, the videos (i wore out my copy of 'the world we live in and live in hamburg).  the morning violator came out i went to school and left two used cds on the kitchen counter so my mom could take them to our local shop, crandall audio, and trade them in for 'violator.' when i got home i found it sitting on the kitchen table, ran downstars and spent the next 8 hours listening to it over and over and over.  so i can't even tell you how great it was to get home last night, pop in the bonus dvd, and watch the band themselves talk about the making of violator.  what a great, albeit short, documentary.<br /><br />highlights of the documentary: alan wilder. it was amazing to hear him talk about making violator. alan's role in the band has always been underappreciated.  alan is a bright, articulate, eloquent man, and hearing him talk about how he and flood took martin's demos and turned them into 'violator' was a thrill.  it was also a thrill to see the enigmatic floor on camera. for those interested in what producers do (i certainly am), it was incredible to hear flood talking about how he and alan sent the rest of the band away for a day while they completely reworked 'the world in my eyes' and 'enjoy the silence.' we also get interviews with daniel miller, who started this wonderful joyride. we also get interviews with francois kervorkian (who mixed violator), and even anton corbijn, who as you all know, directed all the videos of the era.  after watching the documentary, it's easy to see how much the band means not only to the band members, but the everyone else who works for them. they love the band, the music, everything about depeche mode. you'll also hear the band talking about the near-riot in l.a. at tower records.  amazing stuff.<br /><br />it was incredibly neat to see a press conference with the band in which alan wilder says that the salt lake city gig (which had been rained out at park city and was rescheduled for the next night downtown salt lake city) was the best concert of the tour. i was there, and it was incredible.<br /><br />i won't comment on what the gentleman below wrote about. i have no idea what SACD, or whatever it's called is about. what i do know is that when i compressed them as mp3s this morning, they sound great (much better than the original rip) on my headphones.  that, as well as the documentary and album bsides, make this a terrific reissue, a reissue that mode-a-philes like myself will listen to and watch fondly (and with no small amount of nostalgia).<br /><br />thanks, martin, fletch, alan and dave.ho works for them. they love the band, the music, everything about depeche mode. you'll also hear the band talking about the near-riot in l.a. at tower records.  amazing stuff.    it was incredibly neat to see a press conference with the band in which alan wilder says that the salt lake city gig (which had been rained out at park city and was rescheduled for the next night downtown salt lake city) was the best concert of the tour. i was there, and it was incredible.      i won't comment on what the gentleman below wrote about. i have no idea what SACD, or whatever it's called is about. what i do know is that when i compressed them as mp3s this morning, they sound great (much better than the original rip) on my headphones.  that, as well as the documentary and album bsides, make this a terrific reissue, a reissue that mode-a-philes like myself will listen to and watch fondly (and with no small amount of nostalgia).     thanks, martin, fletch, alan and dave.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|I like listening to new and fresh music but when I plan on listening to A.F.I i want to hear just that, A.F.I... <br />OK so its been ages since they've sounded like Shut Your Mouth and Open your Eyes and I'm still reminiscing for a sound like that of Black Sails in the Sunset, but this album does nothing for me.  It's upbeat, somewhat catchy and experimental but if i wanted that, well I probably would not have bought it.  So I'm doing you guys a favor by saying not to buy it, check out the tracks on purevolume (which by the way are the most horrible tracks on the album) but at least it'll be a fair warning.  And I agree with someone on here who posted that even Sing the Sorrow was 10,000x better...Kiss and Control kind of sounds like something that would have been on that album.  <br />Best so far:  The Interview, Affliction,
B00005JOVH|5.0|I'm going to admit that I have absolutely loved the first two X-Men movies. So, I had a lot of expectations for this movie. I'll be honest, I liked the movie, but I was still slightly disappointed. <br /> <br />The movie is really fun. The cast is great. I think much of the casting in the X-Men movies have been spot on. Hugh Jackson, Famke Jansen, Ian McKellen, & Patrick Stewart are these X-Men characters. The new cast members to the series don't quite like up the original cast or maybe thats the screenplays fault. I don't really get to grasp the newbies except maybe Beast. The new villains, Colossus, Shadowcat, & Angel are a little underdeveloped. <br /> <br />That not a big big problem. Thats not what people see an action movie for. I didn't have a problem with that part of the movie. The action is spectacular and the special effects are great. There is no part that is as exhilarating as Wolverine's fight with Lady Deathstrike in X2, but the fights & effects work. Just the spectacle along is pretty much work the admission to the movie alone. <br /> <br />I liked this movie a lot. It is a little more emotionally involving(word choice?)due to the fact that it is sadder compared to the other movies and the effects, etc are top notch. Great movie, just not as good as the previous two installments. I'll admit though, I probably like it more as it ages. <br /> <br />****1/2 out of 5
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Yuri Orlov (well played by Nicolas Cage), Ukrainian immigrant kid in Brooklyn in the early `80s, casting about for a career, witnesses an assassination attempt on a local mafioso and thinks: Weapons. Everyone wants them, everyone needs them. From selling a single Uzi to a local hood, he progresses to buying up abandoned U.S. small arms overseas, to shipping every kind of munitions you can think of to every part of the globe. Then it's 1992 and the Soviet Union collapses, and ex-Soviet army officers in all the various republics begin selling off the weapons systems under their control in order to replace their lost paychecks -- several billions of dollars worth from the newly-independent Ukraine alone. Most of his buyers are African, especially the bloodthirsty dictator of Liberia and his cannibalistic son -- and the Orlov character, who's well aware of what his trade facilitates, has a number of perceptive and pungent things to say about the West's attitudes toward the multiple African genocides of the `90s. (There are a number of shocking scenes and camera shots that are definitely *not* for kids.) Meanwhile, Yuri has acquired a wife, a high-priced model, to whom he lies continually regarding his business, until the straight-arrow ATF agent (or maybe he's Interpol; it's not clear) who has been pursuing her husband for years clues her in. Finally, Yuri's extremely troubled younger brother is killed during a deal in Sierra Leone and it's an overlooked bullet in his body, shipped back to the States, that leads to Yuri's arrest. The climactic scene, in which Yuri explains to the agent exactly how and why no charges will ever be brought -- the government *needs* men like him, though they'll never admit it -- is like a bullet between the eyes. The world's largest arms dealer, in fact, lives in the White House, selling as many weapons in a day as Yuri does in a month. And the largest arms brokers in the world are the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. This is a deeply cynical film, but that doesn't make it wrong.is a deeply cynical film, but that doesn't make it wrong.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I was really anticipating this cd and when it finally came out, I was in the least bit disappointed. This cd is made up of emotion-filled, mind-blowing songs! When I got the cd the day it came out, I sat down in my room and just listened to it a few times all the way through. I really got into the songs...listening to what Davey was saying and the music behind it. It's quite amazing what this band has done since they came onto the music scene. Yea...they are different than before but so what? Like everyone else has been saying...change is good! This band has improved over what they have made before and I believe this is a major step forward in their careers. <br /> <br />Rock on AFI!
006441034X|5.0|The following was written by YM, age 11 (Grade Six), as a homeschool assignment:<br /><br /> I think that this is an amazing series. It sort of combines medieval life with magic so that it is a fantasy novel, and it is a historical fiction novel. Of course, you find out later in the book that it is certainly fiction, and certainly fantasy, but it is definitely not historical. The characters are funny, especially Sophie, who even as an old person doesn't let life get her down. I think this a good book for anyone who likes a good plot with magic and humorous characters. The vocabulary is not too complicated, so it is a good kid's gift, but if you are giving it as a gift, then include the sequel, Castle in the Air. I think it is well worth the price.<br /><br />- Y.M.P.
B00005JO20|5.0|I have to admit that despite the other lukewarm reviews here, that I really liked this film. This is the sort of movie I go to to basically veg out, enjoy the action and special effects, and forget the real world for a while. I usually don't have high expectations for films like this other than to be entertained for the eight bucks or so of my hard earned dollars that I'm plunking down. The special effects in these action blockbusters are so spectacular these days that the human actors almost play second fiddle to that, and unless the acting is just plain bad, I almost don't notice it anymore in movies like this. But my expectations were far exceeded by this film on both counts.<br /><br />Several writers have commented that the movie doesn't take the original film seriously, or that it looks more like a video game than a real movie (mixing dinosaurs and Jurassic Park, essentially, with the King Kong story), but my response to that is a resounding, so what? If you think of the movie as more in the vein of Jurassic Park and similar fun action movies you'll be more on the money than the viewers who see it as a less than dignified and artistically wanting remake of the much venerated original.<br /><br />I think there's room for both types of flicks--artistically serious as well as non-serious, fun-loving action films that admittedly might not be much more than special effects romps. But they're still the most enjoyable sort of mindless, movie going fun. :-) If I want the other sort, I can always watch \\"Citizen Kane\\" and boost my movie I.Q. a few points that way.<br /><br />At just under 180 minutes, it's a monster of a film itself worthy of a three-story high gorilla, and in a film that long, there are stretches where nothing much happens, action-wise, which is okay, as long as they don't drag out too far. In this movie, the first third takes place in Depression era New York, during which we're introduced to the main characters and preparations for the expedition are made. But although the film has a long ramp up to where the action finally starts, I can tell you that the rest is worth waiting for.<br /><br />But once the action starts, and at the risk of sounding hackneyed (sometimes the English language fails me, or perhaps I fail the English language), it's nothing less than awesome. The scene where the dinosaurs are stampeded by the raptors along a cliff and then through the jungle is nothing less than awe-inspiring and that's just one of several great action scenes. Once I saw that, I was hooked and was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the movie. And we haven't even gotten to the scene where King Kong is battling the T-Rex--in what has to be the championship fight between the two biggest, baddest heavyweights in history.<br /><br />I'm no expert myself, but I've heard fans of action movies say that the best action movie of all time is the second Aliens movie. I'm not savvy enough about the genre to really say, but I'll put this movie up there with the best of them. And finally, Jack Black turns in possibly his best performance ever and Naomi Watts, who I recently saw in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, where she was great, turns in another fine performance here. Jackson has another winner here and I think the movie is one of the best of the year.film has a long ramp up to where the action finally starts, I can tell you that the rest is worth waiting for.

B00003CX9E|1.0|This movie just drags on forever and I fell asleep watching it twice.  It took me 3 nights to make it through the movie. <br /> <br />Yes I love Star Wars but I also throughly enjoyed Casablanca and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Those movies have stories and you actually care about the characters.  I could have cared less what happened to Kane and in the end that is what matters to me.  If I don't care about the characters then in my opinion it is not a good movie.
B0002S94OS|3.0|LOG play their instruments skillfully and stick to the thrash metal template with jackhammering rhythms and several exotic scales, noises, and time changes thrown in for good measure.  Yet what mostly differentiates LOG from their thrash forebears is Randy Blythe's combination of throat-grunting and shrill singing/screaming that doesn't quite sound like anyone before him.  Put Phil Anselmo on vocals with the same lyrics as Blythe is singing, though, and you have Pantera.  The antisocial and angry themes are here spouted with the median metal venom.  I want something more than a thrash revival in my metal, considering that thrash never truly passed.  Sepultura are still out there and they're doing a better job than LOG at innovating thrash music, by letting world music, classical, and electronic music influences into their music.<br /><br />Then again, if you're up for the same sort of full-on assault of the senses that have typified thrash bands since Slayer and Exodus (whose guitarist, Alex Skolnick, makes a guest appearance on the title track), _Asheso of the Wake_ will certainly get your blood pumping and your head banging when you play it at full volume.  I guess there's something to be said for perfecting a template that has already been taken to high levels, but in the process of doing this, they certainly have come nowhere near the classics of the genre, like _Master of Puppets_.  It's just all-American evil music.  I'm gonna stick with my not-so-all-American metal like Orthrelm, Pelican, and Dillinger Escape Plan.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Although it is hard to put together all of the classics that Hendrix produced in his time, they have definately managed to catpure the essence of him in this album. A very good place to start if you are wanting to explore Hendrix's music as it contains the best of his signature virtouso style guitar. In reference to Bix Lang, who im sure is an ignorant KKK member, who thinks the idea of opening his mind is an outrage, try actually listening to Hendrix, you may be surprised to find he uses many more than 3 chords! as for your skilled guitarists, they may be reasonably skilled but they were frightened to experiment. if you want skill and melody try listening to hendrix properly, along with Zappa and Jimmy Page.
B000E5KJE8|5.0|I cannot overstate how much I like this movie.  The performance by Denzel Washington as a corrupt LA detective Alonzo is top notch.  Ethan Hawke as the naive rookie cop Jake is also great.  Perfect casting all around.  The movie slowly reveals Alonzo's world and we get to witness Jake's maturation.  Plenty of great dialogue and action mixed in.  The HD DVD transfer is one of the best I've seen yet.  This is one of the all-time great movies and a great transfer.  A must have for any movie buff.
0609610570|3.0|My dogged desire to get through this book ruined the first half of a windsurfing vacation in Aruba.<br /><br />It's very, very dry going, and at the end one wonders what, if anything the authors really had to say.<br /><br />It sounds on the surface like cutting edge management practice. For instance Bossidy and Charan introduce the concept of \\"the social software of execution\\" as a key element for creating the framework for cultural change in the organization. They go on to elaborate, \\"A key component of software is what we call Social Operating Mechanisms\\". At this point I was on the edge of my chair, ready to absorb what was being teed up as an idea of potentially transformational impact. So what are Social Operating Mechanisms? The authors go on to explain, \\"These are formal or informal meetings, presentations, even memos or e-mail exchanges - anywhere that dialogue takes place\\".<br /><br />Wow - this is really deep stuff...<br /><br />One wonders why the authors don't simply refer to communication rather than Social Operating Mechanisms. And, as a separate matter, the lack of literacy is surprising. Since when, for example, are memos and e-mail exchanges places?<br /><br />Stripped of all of this, what the authors have to say is simple common sense that can be summarized as follows:<br /><br />* Successful companies have the important ability to get things done (or execute).<br /><br />* Good leadership (knowing people, setting clear goals, following through, etc.) is a prerequisite of execution.<br /><br />* Reward systems, communications, and feedback processes need to foster action and provide incentives for getting things done.<br /><br />* Some people are more capable than others are to get things done. These are the people that should be put in positions of authority in the organization.<br /><br />* Strategic plans need to reflect the real world and link to operational plans. They also need to be tested for feasibility in the context of the organization's capabilities.<br /><br />None of this is rocket science, that is until one begins to cloak it in management techno speak such as that described above.<br /><br />And one more thing. The editor should have had a \\"robust conversation\\" with the authors about their overuse of the word \\"robust\\". It's really annoying.cloak it in management techno speak such as that described above.    And one more thing.

B000FKO0Q0|5.0|Although this movie is fantastic, sadly it is one of Harrison Ford's last good performances (other than perhaps \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" in 1994).  Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble, a man wrongly accused of killing his wife.  He escapes prison and then sets out to not only avoid recapture, but also prove his innocence.  As good as Ford's performance is, this movie is really carried by Tommy Lee Jones who plays Marshall Samual Gerard.  His humor and intensity are outstanding.  The plot is intriguing with lots of action.  This is the first movie I've had the pleasure to see in the theater, on laserdisc, on DVD, and now on HD DVD.  The HD DVD transfer is quite good and the sound is improved over the DVD version as well.  Highly recommended.
B000683VI4|1.0|This movie is SO BAD! \\"The Notebook\\" is a great example of how Hollywood imbeciles can destroy a perfectly good novel when they attempt to turn it into a film. Nicholas Sparks' novel is a very poignant love story about Allie and Noah, two people who fall in love as teenagers in the early 1940s. Allie's parents do not approve of the relationship because Noah comes from a poor family, and so the young couple is torn apart. Years later, right before Allie is about to marry another man, she sees a photo of Noah in a newspaper and decides to pay him one last visit. Noah and Allie realize that the love they once felt for each other is still very much alive, and Allie must decide whether to return home to her fiance or follow her heart and be with Noah.<br /><br />What makes the story so original is that it is actually told in a series of flashbacks. Eighty-year-old Noah is reading the story to his wife, Allie, who is in a hospital suffering from the advanced stages of Alzheimer's. Allie can barely remember her husband anymore, and Noah is trying to trigger her memory by telling her all about their relationship.<br /><br />Sparks' novel is beautifully written, but unfortunately there's nothing beautiful about the movie. First of all, the script is an absolute nightmare. I don't understand how it's possible to muck up a book that's only 200 pages long, but whoever adapted the screenplay managed to find a way. All of the tenderness from Sparks' novel is lost in the film version. I also think the casting of the movie is terrible. Rachel McAdams is pretty bad as Allie, but her performance is dazzling compared to Ryan Gosling's, who is simply AWFUL! When you read Sparks' novel, you instantly become attached to the characters of Noah and Allie and can sense that there is something very special about both of them. There is NOTHING special about the characters in the movie. Allie just kind of takes up space on the screen, and Noah is incredibly wishy-washy...why on earth would any woman choose to be with him? (And the guy's supposed to be a poet?! COME ON!)<br /><br />I also hated the way that the relationship between Allie and Noah was chopped up onscreen. In the book, Allie is very timid when she arrives at Noah's house and it takes her a long time to overcome her shyness and open up to him. In the movie, the characters are going at it in the foyer about five minutes after Allie arrives at the house. There's nothing beautiful or romantic about it at all...it was just plain trashy and disgusting to watch.<br /><br />James Garner and Gena Rowlands both deliver decent performances playing Noah and Allie when they're older, but I thought that whole aspect of the story was adapted very poorly for the movie. Noah is supposed to be in pretty frail health at age 80, but Garner was running around and dancing up a storm...he was a more lively Noah than Ryan Gosling was when he was playing Noah at age 30! Also, with the exception of the little episode Allie has after dancing with Noah about five minutes before the end of the film, I thought that the film really glossed over the true nature of Alzheimer's. Older Allie wouldn't have looked so \\"together\\" for most of the movie, and Noah would have been much frailer. Why couldn't the film depicted aging and disease as honestly as Sparks did in the book?<br /><br />I could go on and on about the other things I hated about this movie: so much material was cut from the book and so many stupid scenes were added for no apparent reason. (That bit with Allie and her mom looking spying on that man at the construction site...where did THAT come from? And what was up with having Allie meet Noah's sort-of girlfriend?) However, to continue to elaborate on this would be a waste of my time. Here's my advice: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! Read the book instead...you'll be glad you did.d any woman choose to be with him?

B000FFJ85I|2.0|I am a fan of Sing the Sorrow and The Art of Drowning and I was really expecting a lot of great things from AFI. (Well actually I guess I'm considered a \\"new\\" fan since I didn't even know about this band until recently. I was only about 11 or 12 years old when The Art of Drowning was released, and obviously not many 11 year olds listened to this type of stuff) But when I heard this new album (on MTV's Leak), I was in complete shock. I felt that this didn't sound like AFI at all. It sounded like a band that was trying to blend in with all the other bands in today's culture. Also, some songs were like pop, which is extremely dissapointing. Several times during the album, I was like \\"Wait...who am I listening to again? My Chemical Romance or Atreyu?\\" They've definitely lost their unique, hard sound and traded it for completely slow and \\"emo\\" lyrics and melodies. There are too many techno sounds in the background, and not as much guitar. There isn't any passion or excitement in the songs anymore, and most are calm and mellow, unlike old AFI songs. (Also, Davey's scream is kind of annoying in this album) Although some songs are decent, like Miss Murder and The Killing Lights, most of them weren't too good considering AFI's past songs. Also, it felt like they got too much outside help in creating this album, and it no longer has a unique AFI feel to it.     It's a great thing that AFI wants to mature and progress, and I believe it's natural for each band to go through a maturation process. But somehow I feel that they've lost themselves along the way. Perhaps they're trying too hard to please the mainstream or something, but they have definitely changed into a band that is strange to old and maybe new AFI fans. I know that they are never going to produce another CD like STS or TAOD, but I did not expect such a big and dissapointing change. STS was a good change, whereas this is not. It's perfectly ok if you like it, but to me, it's simply not AFI anymore. I've really tried to be open-minded towards AFI's new sound, but I just can't listen to it in the end. Basically, everything I once liked about AFI is now officially gone.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|than listen to this album all the way through. i had a bad feeling about this, but i had no idea how right i would be. A complete turn around from everything i liked about this band. this is nothing but a watered down, skeltal version of a band that used to have clout. they music is just so different from what they used to do. before they had power and intensity in their music, now its just slow, mechanized techno junk without a single trace of originallity. I can't deny that in the beginning of their career, they never had the strongest lyrics and here it seems they are reverting back to that. Even Sing the Sorrow was better written than this. <br /> <br />I realize it doesnt matter a single bit what i think about this, because it is way too late to do anything about it. i guess its just a shame to see a band i have followed for so long take such a terrible turn. there's nothing wrong with you if you like the new album, i guess its just not me. so i wish you all the best with your little AFI. Just keep in mind, they used to rock so much harder and brought it like you wouldnt believe. now all thats left is another makeup wearing, mainstream spewing, dime-a-dozen, emo band.

B000EJ9MTW|4.0|It may not be a new sound, but it is definitely a glorious departure from most of the whiney, emotional crap that floods most mainstream rock outlets.  If you are a fan of Zeppelin, or a plethera of other 70's bands, or good rock music in general, you will find someting worth your money on this release.  And by the way, reviewer XYZ, WOLFMOTHER is from Austrailia, not Europe.  They are two completely different CONTINENTS.

B000EMGAGW|1.0|Shit man. That f***er 50 sucks, takes the old Mobb Deep and changes them to his style, when I heard this album I just felt like I was listening to 50's album. Not just because Mobb Deep aint the same anymore, the main reason was because 50 is nearly on half of the fockin album. And not just that, also Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Fony Yayo. And maan... M.O.P not on one song. This is just a disapointment that mobb deep whent from \\"The Infamous - Survival of the Fittest & Shook Ones Pt. II\\" which is on my top 10 list over best hip-hop songs ever, to \\"Blood Money - Put 'Em in Their Place\\" which is one of the worst things I've ever heard and make me have a different feeling about Mobb Deep. The only song I can listen to on this cd is Pearly Gates, Havoc was good on that one, didn't really like Prodigy, his rhymes were not his usual. And 50... surprisingly alright (though I don't like him... The Game fan..G-unot). So these are my resoults. If I could I whould give this album 0,5.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Every song on \\"Decemberunderground\\" has emotion behind it. And what is music without emotion or creativity??? I know, it's...Limp Bizkit, Good Charolette, Simple Plan, and those dildos who call themselves Fallout Boy! AFI has in some way carved out their own genre. This CD and \\"Sing the Sorrow\\", isn't really punk or heavy metal, or even nu metal, its purely just...different. I guess what I'm saying is..is that it doesn't define any genre. Which for most is a good thing I believe! To sum up this album: All killer no filler!!
0061091480|5.0|This book changed my life. It helped me dispose of many unhealthy thinking patterns and behaviors I didn't like. This book helped me begin the journey of discovery, of learning to love myself for who I am and even become someone I am still falling in love with. I am buying a copy for a friend who has no idea who she is or what she is doing here. Can't wait to see her grow.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|i think this album is great, on a par with is this it?, which i love. its only similar to the 1st album because its the SAME BAND! there not gonna suddenly turn into led zep or the clash. theres loads of great guitar work, catchy riffs and solos but nothing that says \\"look at me, i can play guitar this fast\\" it just fits the songs. i think casablancas' voice is great and goes well with the music, yeah its a laid back style, but theres a desperation in his voice u cant ignore. good music is just that regardless of their personal background, so dont knock em coz someone says there poor little rich kids. why does that even come into it? the strokes are great*****
B000001GKC|5.0|The end of Herbert K's life brought a strange amount of discord.  His health was very bad after falling off of a podium which broke his hip and there was an estrangement which set in between the Berlin Phil which sadly darkened the last years after all he did for this orchestra.  That being said, the relationship which spawned again with the Vienna Philharmonic was a source of great music making...so that being said one can imagine how fine things were in Vienna in the late 80s with such conductors as Karajan, Giulini, and Abaddo making so many fine recordings in the Sofiensaal...to cap it off Bernstein was doing great Mahler in Vienna at that time as well!! <br /> <br />so...here we come to the last recording of Karajan's career.  It is truly an awesome piece of music making with the Adagio as the high point...all of the wonder of this fine music is here plus the opulent phrasing which only the Vienna Phil can bestow on this music....as for price this recording at any price is worth having.  Not since the like of Klemperer, Jochum and Knappersbusuch has such great Bruckner playing been heard...although I like Barenboim for different reasons his Bruckner is defintely not anywhere in this league... <br /> <br />so for true collectors of fine performances and Conducting this Karajan is a real must!
B00004T0US|4.0|These are Presley \\"Home\\" recordings unlike the fairly recent \\"Home Recordings\\" - personal recordings made in Germany and Memphis, 1959, 1961, and 1966. These are professional cuts *intended* for public consumption. Ofcourse they are Elvis' last studio [\\"Jungle Room\\"] recordings and each and every one of them defy the commonly held notion that this cat was through in '72. His dynamic range had widened with increased power: ofcourse this is evident on \\"Hurt\\", \\"I'll Never Fall In Love Again\\" and interestingly, on the upbeat \\"Way Down\\" and \\"For The Heart\\". (For my money, these last two numbers were ahead of their time, in the \\"modern Country\\" approach).<br />These numbers were undoubtedly close to his heart and highly autobiographical. At times, the lyrical content and interpretation are chilling: the incredible, harrowing \\"Bitter They Are, Harder They Fall\\", a tune which penetrates like the first chill of winter, and, ofcourse, \\"Danny Boy\\" and \\"The Last Farewell\\".<br />Some folks might say the '59 \\"Danny Boy\\" is the essential one: Elvis at his artistic best. Maybe, however, he felt the same loneliness in Europe, soloing, that he felt back home and surrounded by buddies, almost 20 years later.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|A.F.I have always been a harsh band, but those who have heard their recent stuff will agree with me when i say that they are now much quieter and melodic. This album is no exception. <br /> <br />Songs like Kill Caustic are very reminiscent of The Fall Of Troy, whereas Kiss and Control and Killing Lights are more like Hawthorne Heights. Anyone who is a fan of Hardcore/Post Hardcore/Hard Rock or any other genres like that will find something to like here. Standout tracks are: Kill Caustic, Miss Murder, Summer Shudder and especially Endlessly She Said.
0375701427|2.0|Pieces of it are okay--it might even contain the makings of a few short stories--but taken as a whole, it's meandering, repetitive and just plain boring.    I'm part way into it and suspect it's never going to get to the point, so I don't intend to finish it.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|When Underworld first came out it was highly criticized by the critics, but being a fan of Vampire movies I decided to see it anyway.  I was really glad I ignored the critics and saw the first Underworld as it was a delightful film with a solid storyline.<br /><br />Underworld Evolution struggles however with continuing where the original left off.  The film certainly benefits from the original as there are great fighting sequences, lots of action and better special effects, particularly involving the main Villain!  That's about it though.  The acting is mediocre and the storyline is a bit confusing and choppy.  While the movie was entertaining, it really didn't leave me with a 'wow' feeling or much more than the feeling that I had seen it but could have gotten by without.<br /><br />The initial few scene sequences give a pretty good background to setup the story; however it's done in memory flashes that might be difficult to follow for anyone that hasn't seen the original Underworld. I highly recommend watching the original prior to seeing this film.  At times during the beginning, I had trouble understanding parts of the dream sequence and where the writers were going and I've seen the original twice, but hang in there it will make sense in the end!<br /><br />While I'm ranking this movie only 3 out of 5, don't take that as a warning to stay away.  If you enjoyed the first one, odds are you'll enjoy this one too. Just don't expect it to be better than the original.  Sequels rarely are and this one follows that trend.
B000AP04L0|5.0|As far as funny cult classics go, this tops the list.  Although a first-time viewer may not appreciate the humorous subtleties that are laden in every minute of this film, frequent viewing will remedy that problem.   <br /> <br />This is a required part of any comedy library.  Get it!   <br />
B000E5KUK6|1.0|Is there really a need for a \\"Monster Edition\\" of this disgrace? Seriously? One of the worst big budget movies of all time, hands down. Awful script, awful acting, shoddy looking CGI, and a Godzilla that's been reduced to an irradiated iguana. Just terrible all around. I can't imagine why anyone would want to see any sort of special edition of this thing. It's not even fun-bad (like alot of the classic Godzilla movies), it's just plain bad. No thanks.
B000056HE9|5.0|At last here is an angel who really has fun just doing his job.  Dudley (Cary Grant) brings a subtle joy to his interventions and interactions.   The enjoyment factor is what makes \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" special.  This charming and seemingly simple film has been a Christmas holiday staple since its release in 1947.      But like \\"Groundhog Day\\", the surface simplicity is misleading, as this is an allegorical tale about the importance of getting outside ourselves and taking steps to escape  ruts of our day-to-day lives; i.e. finding a better way of living.   Dudley works a few minor heavenly miracles but his real power is as a cheerleader and personal guide.   No need to be an angel to exercise this kind of positive influence on others.     Dudley the angel  comes to earth to help a Bishop (David Niven) juggle his professional and marital commitments, the conflict being that his priorities have changed since his promotion from the priest of a struggling parish.  Only the bishop knows that Dudley is other than human and it takes most of the film before he is totally convinced.  Meanwhile his wife and many others in the town are swept up by Dudley's  charms. The Bishop is pre-occupied with securing funding for constructing a new cathedral but begins to catch on that Dudley and his wife are getting along so well that the unimaginable could occur-the angel stealing his wife.     If only one word could be used to describe \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" it would be subtle.   The special effects are minimalist but effective, the careful framing and lighting of Gregg Toland's  (\\"Citizen Kane\\") black and white cinematography, the tentative steps title character Julia (Loretta Young) takes as she starts to experience happiness again, and the slow realization by Bishop Henry of how far he has drifted from what matters the most.    The unity and subtlety is best illustrated in the scene of Henry walking up the sidewalk towards the Professor's (Monty Wooley) apartment.   Although a few minutesfrom the end, this is actually the film's climax as Henry is finally confronting himself.  As he walks forward the dark screen begins to get brighter; in step with his progress toward spiritual change and discovery is the end of his physical journey.  He moves symbolically (and literally) toward the light.    Rounding out the strong cast are James Gleason (Max Corkle in \\"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\\") Elsa Lanchester,  and Gladys Cooper.   Henry and Julia's young daughter is played by Karolyn Grimes (Zuzu in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\").    A nice thing is that while the film's \\"little\\" miracles are done onscreen they are interwoven into the fabric of the story instead of dominating a scene.  This casualness fits the tone of the film as does the occasional satirical line.  The most memorable conversation is Cooper's demand (she is pledging money for the new cathedral) that the George figure in the proposed \\"St. George and the Dragon\\" stained glass window  be made to resemble her late husband.  Then Niven (deadpan) asks her whom she wants the dragon to resemble.     There will be a few who do not enjoy this film but I recommend it to anyone who wants a nice holiday film, or who is interested in a relatively deep allegorical tale of one's capacity to be a positive influence on others, or who just wants to see a truly awesome example of technical filmmaking.    Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

B000FFJ85I|4.0|I love the hate in this review thread. It's just great.  Seriously this is quite a departure from the typical AFI we all skate, grind, olie, and make love too.  But on the other hand, This cd is just, well awesome.  I've had this cd on rotation pretty much all day, and it's dynamic as hell.  I took a chance on the cd, hoping it wouldn't suck, at first the poppy vibes were weird, but it's well constructed, and each song evenly flows into the next. <br /> <br />Are AFI a bunch of sellouts? Maybe.  Are they creative artists? Hell yes.  Well orchestrated CD.  If you have an open mind about music, give it a whirl. If you're a die hard, raw militant punk that says OY all day long, this cd will definitely not appeal to you. <br /> <br />From one musician to another, rock on AFI, and grats on taking the risk, or selling out or however ya'll wanna put it. This cd effin' rocks!!!!! <br /> <br />P.S. Oy Oy Oy Oy!
6305428050|5.0|Adventures in Babysitting starring the beautiful and talented Elisabeth Shue is one of my favorite films from the 1980s. (I was born in the '80s!) Directed by Chris Columbus, Adventures in Babysitting follows the life of a high school senior who is asked to babysit on a night when her boyfriend is home watching his kid sister because she is \\"sick.\\" With no plans, she agrees to babysit a couple of suburbia kids for the night. Things go array when Chris's friend runs away from home and calls Chris to pick her up at a bus depot in the city. Then the laughs and excitment ensue, a great family film, I highly recommend this fun film. Don't just sit there, buy this movie today!
B00005Q4GV|5.0|Nearly 40 years later, Patton is a movie that stands the test of time.   Originally, it was supposed to be an anti-war screed (America is evil--the ones who start the war aren't) for vietnam, similar to MASH.  While MASH has become a period piece, Patton has become a classic, despite the intentions of the producers.  MASH sucks, Patton ROCKS.  George C. Scott honors Patton and is true to Farago and the book.
B00012QM86|2.0|The film itself is good. But I really do not understand why it is filmed in black and white. The 1939 to 1945's world is not a black and white world, it is a colored world instead. This black and white film looks like a documentary (WORLD AT WAR) which greatly reduced my interest in seeing it no matter how good its content is. If the film is colored, the German solders's uniform and other people's dressing or coat will be very attractive and beautiful look, and the film will be rated 5 stars.
B0007P3582|1.0|This isn't rap, this is a bunch of pop junk. People should really stop listening to this guy and get into some real music. Candy Shop is such an annoying song. Nobody cares that you got shot 9 times and lived 50 Cent, stop talking about it. Also stop talking about how thug and ghetto you are and guns are cool because you are just making society a whole lot worse.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|whomever have bought this set, so does this come with ALL ten seasons and the collector box? i havent recieved it yet and wanted to know to make sure..
B000AJJNOK|1.0|yeah best album ever made if you like bad music. money goin' down the drain with this one.....
B000FFJ85I|3.0|I'm just not sure what I think of this album.  I am more a fan of AFI's older material, though I do like Sing the Sorrow (don't tell my punk friends!).  This album definitely lacks that feel, which isn't in and of itself a bad thing, but it definitely differs from most of what I typically listen to (which is generally older and local punk/hardcore).  Also, it sounds quite comercial- and mainstream-oriented, which is (I suppose) forgivable given the direction they've been taking, certainly since StS.  I guess what would make it a good album in my eyes regardless of all that is whether it is sincere and whether it is musically good/pleasing to listen to.  In some respects, it is musically more diverse than their previous works, though I feel that it is a step backwards from Sing the Sorrow in terms of creativity -- it is definitely formulaic at times.  As to its sincerity, I suspect that it is in fact quite sincere, though I base this more upon my knowledge of the band than the music on this particular album.  So, I'd say I like it, though it's not quite my usual fare, but I think it's good to branch out.  In short, if you liked StS, you'll probably like this.  But I think it appeals more to fans of (for instance) Kill Hannah than, say, the Misfits.  At any rate, it's worth a listen.  It may well grow on you (as it may on me).
0895260131|1.0|It always makes me laugh when a non-Muslim writes a book purporting to be the \\"authority\\" on Islam. Islam is not like any other religion, besides the fact that the entire Qu'ran and Islamic law is written in Arabic, a language the author is completely ignorant on, but it would take years of study to fully understand -- a fact that the author admits he spent a few months \\"researching\\". My favorite comment from another reviewer sums thi sbook up perfectly...\\"only in USA such a stupid writer can make money\\".
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Gnarls Barkley is something that I think that the music industry needed.  They bring the \\"out of the box\\" appeal that so much of music today has lost.  That isn't surprising based upon the two minds whose brainchild Gnarls Barkley is soulful crooner-rapper Cee-Loo (Thomas Callaway) and Danger Mouse.  Cee-Lo is similar to OutKast in his sense of music because both him and OutKast tend to look outside of the box rather than just do what everybody else is doing.<br /><br />The production here is a masterpiece and easily deserves 5 stars in itself. Cee-Lo's soulful vocals give you chills throughout this project.  My favorites include addictive first single \\"Crazy\\", \\"St. Elsewhere\\", \\"Smiley Faces\\", \\"The Boogie Monster\\", \\"Transformer\\", and \\"Who Cares?\\".  To be honest, the only faults with the album is 37 minutes feels like a cheat and perhaps the production is a bit much at times.  Overall, it is one of the year's freshest and unique albums. 4 stars.
B000ESSTKG|5.0|These three reissues are packaged and priced very similarly to The Cure's reissues that are being released; meaning that the sound quality is very much improved over the original cd issues, the packaging is top-notch, and the bonus material is worth the \\"deluxe edition\\" price.  <br /> <br />Disc one is the original album, remastered with a very warm sound instead of being harsh and overly-loud. The most notable sound improvement is the closing instrumental, 'Pimpf'. That track, much like minimalist classical, is about repetition off of a theme, so each entrance comes in clearly and overall sounds a lot more dynamic. 'Behind The Wheel' and 'Never Let Me Down Again' sound a lot more dynamic and powerful with these new remasters, where the aforementioned 'Pimpf' and 'I Want You Now' (complete with sampled breathing sound effects from real people and an accordion being improperly played) allow their subtle intracacies to show. <br /> <br />Instead of opting for a second disc of rare outtakes, live material, and demos, disc two is a dvd filled with material (such as a documentaries, 5.1 mixes, and strangely, the b-sides).  <br /> <br />The choice to not reissue the catalogue in chronological order makes me wonder if the other albums will be released in this same fashion; also like The Cure reissues, will there be single disc counterparts to be released shortly after these expanded versions?
B000E6UK5K|4.0|...not having Roger Waters anywhere near this. <br />Sounds like the best Pink Floyd album I've heard since \\"Obscured by Clouds\\".
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Being a big metal & horror movie fan myself, I follow all of Rob Zombie's projects, and I absolutely love this one too!!  It's got a little of everything and it ROCKS as usual!! He's sooo ultimately, multi-talented and intelligent and he puts a lot of thought into all his projects, it's not just thrown together to sound like everything else he's done in the past, I always look forward to seeing what he's going to do next, if it all sounded like the old White Zombie it would get old really fast.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Gee, hate to hearken back to the original \\"Amazon official reviewer\\" but when I hear a comment like \\"no centerpiece\\" all I really hear is \\"no big breakout hit song\\". And that, my friends is exactly what is wrong with the traditional music business today.  But fortunately, people don't seem to care about that, at least on Amazon, because it has been in the top 10 since its release.  Yes, expectations should have been high.  Mine were and I was not disappointed.  These are 2 great artists.  Give 'em their due and realize that not every album has to have a hit.  Do you think Mark or Emmylou care?  I sincerely doubt it.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|All of you, Floyd fans, cannot let the due date pass. You have to get this DVD the exact date is released. I just don't get tired of listening the live CD. I really, really, really wish that the original band re-unite once again, as they did on LIVE 8, but not for another special gig, but for a big tour, and what the hell, a new album? I've been told, concerning this concert, that it has won lots of awards, like the best illumination or something like that. This DVD it is a MUST HAVE. Chalfont!

B00005Y1UX|3.0|The spirit of the tragedy has been slow but progressively demolished and even confiscated since the XVII Century. Since these ages, the tragedy has suffered a visible process of perverse distortion, becoming just a moral lesson to follow. Jean Anouilh, Jean Paul Sartre, Joyce, Selma Lagerloff, Albert Camus, Fedor Dostoievsky,  Eugene O Neill, Giovanni Papini, Ionesco, Beckett, William Faulkner, Ernst Hemingway, August Strindberg and Henrik Ibsen  are weird exceptions, but in general terms, the cathartic experience derived from the tragic ethos, has vanished.<br /><br />So, if you dissect the tragedy into fragments of moral lessons, you just are telling a fable, but nothing else. You simply have frozen the wrath of Gods into hermeneutic pills, in order to satisfy the great audiences and so guarantee them, a final return to their respective homes. But the soul has not suffered the expected shock, and the spirit has not experienced the sharpness of the contrasts: long life to triviality.  In the tragedy there are not good guys or bad guys; there' s no one absolutely innocent; the tragedy is the violation and transgression of a rule related with the cosmic order. It's impossible to understand in its wholeness, the force of its significance if you do not look it under the mythic coordinates.<br /><br />The film starts with an interesting dilemma to solve what if?. The corrosive and nasty feature represented by Redford , may be considered as the Devil' s embodiment. The proposal was made and accepted. But once the dramatic peak has been reached, one can feel how the film precipitates obstreperously, the expected reactions fall in a well know stereotyped cliche; she cries and is in shame; he looks arrogant but then the character becomes a marionette.<br /><br />A false redemption works out as the final launch, that will allow them to understand one each other and the forgiveness will hover about them.<br /><br />This material really did not deserve such predictable final. In hands of Robert van Akeren (The woman in flames), for instance the result would have been absolutely different; there is a lot of self indulgence not only for the characters and the audience in general.Akeren (The woman in flames), for instance the result would have been absolutely different; there is a lot of self indulgence not only for the characters and the audience in general.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|The Constant Gardener can easily be summed in one word: masterpiece.  You've either seen the film, or read the reviews, so without going through a detailed summary of the film, I can basically say that the film was sadly overlooked in the Best Picture category at this year's Oscars.  Rachel Weisz deservedly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her impassioned, heartfelt portrayal of Tessa, but why was Ralph Fiennes left behind.  The chemistry between the two actors is mesmerizing and captivating.  You can truly feel the love he has for her, and ultimately long for them to connect until tragedy strikes, and sets a series of events into motion. Combining passion, tragedy, beauty, love, and a serious examination of pharmaceutical industries, all executed in seamless fashion, The Constant Gardener ranks as an unforgettable film that will stand the test of time.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This is by far is the best soundtrack for some time.  It is a relaxing album.  For example, track 1, 5, 8 are so relaxing and I like those.  For track 10, it is kind of a touching music there.  For track 17, it is perfect and the best in all 16 tracks there.  Overall, this soundtrack is recommended because it is absolutely brilliant.  Buy it or you will regret it.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|PURPOSE: Validate the conjecture that a happy movie would be sad. <br /> <br />GOAL: Show that a happy movie would be sad, using \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" as an example. <br /> <br />DEFINITION: happy movie - one that invokes happiness or satisfaction within the viewer so as to cause him/her to reward it with no less than 5 stars. <br /> <br />THEOREM: \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a happy movie. <br /> <br />PROOF: Let us assume that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a happy movie, then from our definition of happy movie, it follows that the viewer must reward it with no less than 5 stars. This implies that the movie has invoked happiness or satisfaction within the viewer. The viewer has awarded \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" with no less than five stars. This shows that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a happy movie and our proof is complete. <br /> <br />REMARK: The proof of our theorem that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a happy movie only refers to a single viewer. However, this result of this proof is also applicable to multiple viewers. Furthermore, we can strengthen its validity if we use the fact that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" has currently garnered over 900 customer reviews, a significant majority of which are no less than five stars. This implies that the movie has invoked happiness in not a single viewer, but multiple viewers. <br /> <br />LEMMA: \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a sad movie. <br /> <br />PROOF: Suppose that a sad movie is defined as one containing sad events or a sad ending. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a movie containing a sad ending. From our definition of sad movie, it follows that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a sad movie. This completes our proof. <br /> <br />To show that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a happy movie that would be sad, we can use the results of our proofs of the theorem asserting that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a happy movie and the lemma asserting that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a sad movie and combine their resolutions. For instance, we can use the fact that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a sad movie containing a sad ending. which has garnered over 900 reviews from customers, the majority of which have five-star ratings. In spite of this, it contains a sad ending. The fact that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a sad movie containing a sad ending further implies that such a movie is what is necessary for a movie to invoke happiness or satisfaction within the viewer(s), as demonstrated by the hundreds of five-star reviews that it has received from customers. This validates our conjecture that a happy movie would be sad, using \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" as an example. <br /> <br />REMARK: Although we have shown that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a happy movie which would be sad, we need to clarify any significant ambiguity concerning the nature of a sad movie. Recall our definition of sad movie, that is, one containing sad events or a sad ending. Examples of sad events or a sad endings can are inclusive of, but not limited to, the following: the death of a main character, a terrible epidemic that wipes out a majority of the characters featured in the story, instances of unsolved poverty, inevitable warfare, natural disasters capable of invoking widespread famine, etc. We leave it to the potential viewer of the film to investigate further examples of sad events or sad endings found in \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" lest we spoil crucial plot details.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is a very good movie.  It is a masterpiece all around.  For the story, it was good and touching, I almost cried out like I watched \\"Titanic\\" almost 10 years ago.  For the acting, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal have perfect acting for this movie.  Others are also good in this particular movie.  For the direction, it is perfect, Ang Lee.  I know that this movie maybe quite ambitious, but it turns out to be good.  So, it is a good one.  For the visuals, it is okay as it is not like a real action.  It is about touching love and romance, so it is kind of not applicable here.  For the music, I feel so enjoyable as I hear the music in the middle of the scenes because they are so relaxing.  For the sound effects, it is good too.  Therefore, this movie is recommended all the time.
0140288503|5.0|I just got done reading this book cover to cover at the beach.  What a gripping read.  Although I haven't seen the movie, I did see a very nice 2 hour piece on the History Channel that Bowden participated in and included a lot of interviews with the Rangers from Task Force Ranger.  I was worried it may have \\"spoiled\\" the book.  It didn't. <br /> <br />This is a great book that should really be required reading.  For some reason, this battle has been cast as some sort of disaster for the US.  The performance of the Rangers and Delta Force was amazing.  What heroism!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|This CD is great...Perfect for every AFI fan. And for people who are like, uhh I like Sing of the sorrys or Halloween better, cause now they sound different. They DONT! haha its only Miss Murder that really makes it sound kinda different. Its a buy. especially for $9.99
B000FQJAIW|4.0|I'm going to buy the original version of episode IV, because I don't like the changes Lucas made. I know I'm in the minority here, but the changes to episode V and VI made those films better. I'm just as frustrated as everyone else with the way Lucas keeps dangling different versions in front us. I'm not going to buy any of the films again after this.
B000001Y2U|2.0|I have really high regards for Reznor, being a fan of NIN for a good amount of time, I figured I'd give his protege of some sort, Manson a try, the way I've always felt that he is more of a gimmick than a musician, or the image being more important than the actual value of his music. I gave AS a try, and wasn't really surprised. 'The Beautifle People', his most famous song, is really great and catchy, but when it comes down to it, the remainder of this album is really mediocre and not memorable. It also sounds quite egotistical, even if that may be meant to be taken as ironic.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is such a wonderful film. The main character is Margaret Hale. Her father uproots the family to move them North to Milton, an industrial town. While looking for a house to rent, Margaret meets Mr. Thornton under less than perfect circumstances and takes an instant dislike to him. He, on the other hand, is intrigued by her. Their relationship takes many twists and turns. Margaret comes to understand Mr. Thornton and admire him, but past misunderstandings and a rejected marriage proposal makes it difficult for them. (Sound familiar.)<br />This movie reminds me very much of Pride and Prejudice. I guess that's why I love it so much. If you like Pride and Prejudice, you will like this movie.<br />Wonderful scenes to look for:<br />1. When Henry comes to visit Margaret in Heldstand. - Part One<br />2. The letter to Edith, Margaret's cousin. \\" I think I have seen Hell, and it is white. Snowy white.\\" - Part One<br />3. The angry mob scene. Margaret throws herself in harms way to protect Mr. Thornton. - Part Two<br />4. The marriage proposal. (Bless his heart.) - Part Two<br />5. The death of her father. - Part Four<br />6. Higgins explains some things about Margaret to Thornton. This explanation is crucial to resolving the conflict between Margaret and Thornton. - Part Four<br />7. The train depot - half way to London. Margaret and Thornton meet after several months. (The kiss.) - Part Four<br /><br />The score in the movie was beautiful. I hope it will come out on CD soon.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|WARNING: In all, this cd does not sound at all like anything they have ever done.  But at the same time it is a killer new album.  THe intro to the album is done in same AFI fasion, then Kill Caustic kicks in which is the best song on the cd in my opinion.  Then the rest of the tracks just take you further deeper into the oh-so experimental AFI. There are lots of new instrumentations on here which just prove of how just great of musicians these guys are.  Davey's voice is beautiful throughout the whole thing.  There are weird techno samples that also spice everything up and make it even more weird. New fans of AFI (like the ones that think Sing the Sorrow was the first record) will dig this.  Long Term fans (like myself) may dig it depending on how open your mind is.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|I was horribly disappointed in the new cd. AFI has completely sold out. I had stayed with them through the Sing the Sorrow cd but i can't do it anymore. It's become way too emo with a twist of bad techno. If you are a fan of their classic sound, i doubt you are going to like it. If you like the typical sound of bands nowadays then yes im sure you will like it.
B000F48CD8|2.0|I own and love CDs of both Brendan Benson and The White Stripes, but I was really disappointed with this CD. The first song, \\"Steady as she goes\\" is the best on the CD, and the rest are pretty forgettable.
B00017OCLA|2.0|This is a film that both my daughter and I were interested in seeing, given the acclaim that Bill Murray's performance had drawn. Moreover, the film itself had drawn critical acclaim. So, when my daughter was home from college one weekend, we decided to hunker down and watch it together. When we both fell asleep while watching it, we decided that we were just tired. So, we decided to give it another go around the next evening. Well, unlike love, it was not much better the second time around, though we managed to avoid falling asleep, yet again.<br /><br />Quite frankly, if Sophia Coppola, the writer and director of this film, were not the daughter of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, I am convinced that this film would have quickly vanished without a trace. In fact, I doubt that it would even have been made. When her acting career fizzled, after making her less than memorable acting debut in her father's film \\"Godfather III\\", Sophia Coppola apparently turned her hand to directing and was let loose upon an unsuspecting public.<br /><br />While this film has good production values, it simply meanders along in a loosey-goosey sort of way. If focuses upon two individuals, Americans who find themselves in Tokyo, alienated from their surroundings and, seemingly, from life in general. One of these individuals is Bob Harris, a film actor on a career downslide, who now finds himself shilling whiskey in Japan for mega bucks, while his movie career is at an impasse. The other is a beautiful twenty-five year old woman, a Yale Graduate with a degree in philosophy, who is in Japan with her husband, a photographer who is working on a shooting assignment.<br /><br />Bob Harris, played with wry bemusement by Bill Murray, is a man who is alienated from his family and, quite frankly, just plain lonely. His is a stark universe, as he seems to have a myopic view on life, seeing little beyond his luxury hotel's bar, where he like to go and drink. Charlotte, played with surprising maturity and flair by eighteen year old Scarlett Johansson, feels bereft and set adrift, as she struggles to keep herself occupied while her husband is ostensibly working. It is these two souls whose worlds collide, coloring their perspectives on life when an unlikely bond forms between them.<br /><br />The film, which takes place in Tokyo, Japan, appears to mock the Japanese. Its stereotypic portrayal of the Japanese people, generally as buffoons, is reprehensible and a cheap joke. Sophia Coppola apparently thinks that the way Japanese people speak English is funny, as it is a running, unfunny joke through out the film. Since the film takes place in Japan, perhaps it might have been funnier to see Bob (or Charlotte) attempt to speak Japanese, rather than turn Bob into the quintessential ugly American.<br /><br />The film meanders along lacking a definitive narrative and any real profundity of thought. While there is definition about the characters' exterior selves, the film never delves into their inner selves in defining their present state of affairs. There are no big or traditional cinematic moments. Unfortunately, there are no small ones either, as there is really no introspection by either of the two protagonists. This is a film that viewers will either love or hate. I fall into the latter category. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is simply lost on me.maturity and flair by eighteen year old Scarlett Johansson, feels bereft and set adrift, as she struggles to keep herself occupied while her husband is ostensibly working.

B000002JOH|4.0|Back in 1992, I saw Pantera when they opened up for Skid Row and I seemed to be the only person who knew who they were.  I always throught they should have had more recognition.  This is one of the coolest albums I ever purchased.  It's heavy, it's thoughtful, it's pounding and screaming.<br /><br />Hollow is a standout track, don't let it fool you, because it is stuck at the end of the cd.  Other great songs from this album are: A New Level, Walk, Mouth for War, F*ing Hostile, This Love, by Demons be Driven and Regular People.
1402568851|5.0|\\"Curious Incident\\" starts out as a story of a murdered dog, but quickly develops into much more. Christopher Boone, the book's narrator, tells us of his discovery of the mysterious death of Wellington, the neighbor's poodle. But it quickly become apparent that there is something \\"off\\" about Christopher. He screams when people touch him; he is weirdly attentive to details that most people ignore; he is extremely literal-minded; and he is oddly polite in a mechanical way that is unusual for a teenager. Clearly, he is either autistic or has Asperger's Syndrome, and this puts a bizarre twist on what would be an ordinary mystery.<br /><br />In spite of his father's opposition, Christopher decides to track down Wellington's murderer. For a young man in his condition, this proves to be a daunting task. Christopher's dogged persistence draws him into painful family secrets and takes him far beyond the confines of his comfortable and predictable life. That last comment, about his \\"comfortable and predictable life\\" is not a slap at his family's bourgeois values. For Christopher, predictability and routine are lifelines to sanity and functioning. Without his time table and the rules invented by his teachers, he is lost. That he is willing to step outside these bounds is an indicator of his courage and determination.<br /><br />It doesn't take long to begin seeing the world through Christopher's eyes, and this is a wonderful by-product of this book. Autistic children seem alien, with their routines and lack of affect. But seen from the inside, there is a definite logic to their actions. By the end of the book, I cringed when Christopher was mishandled by people who should have known better than to ignore his taboos -- the color yellow, strangers and using unfamiliar toilets. By the end of the book, I was starting to wonder whether I was more like Christopher than the others - those poor individuals who see only a nice field of cows when Christopher sees 19, including the 5 facing uphill, not to mention another two dozen details.<br /><br />\\"Curious Incident\\" does not make Christopher a saint. He can lie -- by purposefully avoiding the literal sense of the commands of others. And he is difficult and exasperating, especially to his working class parents who love him, but cannot understand his world. The centrifugal effect that autism can have on a family is on display throughout this story.<br /><br />I have been recommending \\"Curious Incident\\" to everyone I have spoken to. The book was an informative and a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end. Narrator Jeff Woodman was wonderful, expertly giving Christopher just enough emotion to avoid monotone, but not so much as to make him unbelievable.<br /><br />A masterpiece.o mention another two dozen details.    \\"Curious Incident\\" does not make Christopher a saint.

B000FFJ85I|5.0|Yes, I just said that.<br /><br />I'll never forget when I first heard this album. I was still kinda getting used to AFI's new direction in Sing the Sorrow; part of me thought that the band would essentially be over for any 'hardcore' fans(which was the case for certain people); part of me thought that greatness might come. And thankfully, Decemberunderground delivered that greatness in spades.<br /><br />Some would say that the album centers on one theme, and I think that theme would be finding shelter in a dark world. Some of AFI's earlier, more aggressive material was about anger and being unable to resist corruption in a corrupt world. Sing the Sorrow was about despair and, well, sorrow. And Decemberunderground is about the struggle of finding shelter in an evil world. That's what it feels like to me; some songs do feel comfortable while desperate, and give you the feeling you just can't cling on to what makes you sane anymore.<br /><br />The band is on top form. Davey Havok gives some of his most personal vocal performances, while Jade's guitar parts are some of the most intricate the band has ever done. The bass and drums seem less flashy this time around, but I think the music really calls for that. The band has experimented with synths and electronics in certain songs before, but they're used quite a bit here, and I think to a great advantage. AFI has never stayed in one place for any 2 albums, and Decemberunderground was where they fully embraced that.<br /><br />I've heard just about every song AFI has ever made, and this is by far my favorite piece of music by them. It's dark, epic, sad (though joyous in parts), and just the most memorable AFI listening experience I've had. Although I think it's easily one of the most misunderstood albums of our time, I can see why it got it's backlash when it came out, especially from 'hardcore' AFI fans who still couldn't adjust to the band's sound. They're not \\"ignorant\\" or \\"stupid\\", and it's not that they \\"don't get it\\"; they just don't like it, and that's just fine with me. But I think this will always be a special album in AFI's catalogue, and it remains their unsung masterpiece.that's just fine with me.

B000FILW86|2.0|because I really disliked this cd!!!!! This is definitely not the classic Cheap Trick I know and love....to put it lightly, I was highly dissappointed. Of course I came to Amazon.com first before buying the cd, because most often you can preview the cd (not the case here, probably because the cd was just released yesterday), and the reviews are reliable, and I read/heard only good things about this album. So you can imagine my shock when I bought the cd and actually listened to it! It falls so short of all the hype and my expectations!!! There isn't one song on here that even remotely compares to Cheap Trick's great hits such as \\"Southern Girls\\", \\"I Want You to Want Me\\", \\"If You Want My Love\\", \\"The Flame\\", \\"Surrender\\", \\"I Can't Understand It\\", \\"Up the Creek\\", \\"Come On Come On\\", \\"Elo Kiddies\\", \\"Dream Police\\", \\"Stop This Game\\", \\"She's Tight\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Oh Candy\\", and \\"Don't Be Cruel\\". The songs of Rockford just don't have the same \\"star-quality\\" as those I previously mentioned. Robin's voice sounds squeaky and aged, and often softer than usual (of course he IS alot older...not holding that against him, just pointing it out)...and the tunes just sound awkward altogether. None of the songs are \\"hard\\" enough. The only OKAY songs on this album in my opinion are \\"This Time You Got It\\", (by far the best) \\"Give It Away\\", \\"Dream the Night Away\\", and \\"Decaf\\". None of the songs, though, will be uploaded onto my MP3 player. However, even though I don't like their new stuff, Cheap Trick's old stuff will NEVER grow old in my eyes and I will forever be a fan. (How can I not be?! Rick and Robin live a few blocks away from me!!) To classic fans: Let's hope they get it right with the next cd. I look forward to it, and really hope they do in fact keep on rockin' for at least another decade. To new fans: Download all the old songs I named and skip this cd. It just won't show you who the REAL CHEAP TRICK is.             <br />
B000F6IOC0|5.0|I liked the first Underworld and was disappointed when I read the reviews on the sequel that said it was not that good - I strongly disagree with the critics.  This was an excellent sequel that topped the original.  Kate Beckinsale is amazing!  I enjoyed the storyline and the special effects are great! Check this movie out for a fun time!
B00000294R|5.0|2pac wack.............If it werent for someone like L, Hip Hop would be real dumb.  We would all be hearing 2pac spouting off his wack, simplistic lyrics, and continue to hear hip hop ruined.  Pac made his career off the diss record, that i think has ruined hip hop, and anything that big L did is a breath of fresh air into the game.  Most underated, unappreciated lyricists EVER!!! <br />Him and Biggie 1 and 2.  West Coast rap should bow down with their BS lyrics, and there easily duplicated beats.  Drop Pac and pick up an L album if you a true fan of hip hop..
B000FILW86|5.0|Magnificent!! The writing is so strong, the performances self assured and the production is perfectly suited to the arrangements. They even splurge on the packaging. As with Heaven Tonight, Rockford comes on the heels of 2 remarkable efforts, CT97 (raw) and Special One (eclectic). However, the comparison ends there. I previewed this CD in headphones for maximum wallop. Just when you think you are treading familiar territory, they go Sandy Kofax on you mid tune to places no 3 chord rock should go. It seems so effortless but anyone who has ever put a record together will recognize musical superiority in an instant. As soon as it began it seemed to be over. 12 tracks stormed through my being and simply had to be played in it's entirety again. I kept asking myself \\"How?\\". How can they be so great? As a fan and musician I felt compelled to find flaws and weakness. It's air tight. Check out the vinyl LP intro groove sample midway as if you had to turn the LP over to side 2; complete with Rick guffaw. Everything really does work if you let it.
